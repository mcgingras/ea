Jeff Bezos does not have a hundred billion dollars sleeping in a bank account. His wealth consists mainly of the ownership of Amazon.</p><p>The na\u00efve meaning of \u201cDonate\u201d would be to sell Amazon, lose control over the world's most important firm, and spend the money on bednets and grants. Bezos has enriched himself by developing and implementing a series of processes that have massively facilitated direct interaction between consumers and producers. In many ways, Amazon is the most important interface between the economy of bits and the economy of atoms. It is an extraordinary agent of progress and a severe threat to a healthy competitive market. A great power in search of fulfilling its great responsibility.</p><p>Any proposition for the use of that wealth that focuses on what to do with the money but ignores <i>where it comes from</i> is wrong from the beginning. This is obviously true in the case of a company as strategic as Amazon, but also in the case of more normal businesses: transferring power in exchange for money is always bad practice: you soon find yourself with none (\u201c<i>non bene pro toto libertas venditur auro</i>\u201d: once you are a slave, the gold earned by selling your liberty can easily be extorted from you).</p><h2>Healthy competition: Platforms as ecology managers</h2><p>The case of Amazon is especially interesting because its business is intermediation. If the platform performs this task in a neutral way that respects the principle of a \"level playing field\", and gives rise to a competitive market, the effects in terms of productivity and equality will be much higher than the weaponization of the platform to capture market segment.&nbsp;</p><p>Lisa Khan, current chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, began her academic career with a harsh criticism of Amazon behavior (Khan, 2017). I cannot judge to what extent the criticism is justified, but from a utilitarian perspective, long before thinking about the Amazon\u2019s profits, the main social interest is that the immense volumes of value that are intermediated on the platform are so with transparent rules that favor competition and progress. I tend to think that, for a mature company with Amazon's competitive advantage, this is also its enlightened self-interest.</p><h2>Power and wealth: The moral imperative of ethical lobbying</h2><p>Milton Friedman proposed as a general criterion of business ethics, <i>\"</i><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/a-friedman-doctrine-the-social-responsibility-of-business-is-to.html\"><i>maximize benefits within the Law</i></a>\", and as general rule I believe that a competitive market leaves a limited space to deviate from that maxim.&nbsp;</p><p>However, Friedman's principle has a sunken hypothesis: that the Law is given, and it takes care the general interest. But firms spend large sums in affecting lawmaking and often with purely individualistic goals. In my opinion, although it is legitimate and necessary for a company to take care that the regulation does not harm it in relative terms with respect to its competitors, it is morally required not to participate in lobbying activities aimed at privileging a sector (or a social class) against the general interest. Greed is <i>not</i> good<i> at Congress</i>.</p><p>The logic of the market is Darwinian and by requiring a company to prioritize criteria other than profit maximization there is a risk that whoever follows the advice loses relevance to the extent that she follows it. However, the political use of economic power is much more discretionary and there is far more room for a sustainable ethical position.</p><h2>The republican succession of heroic entrepreneurs</h2><p>For large firms owned by its founder a main issue is how to manage the inevitable dilution of control that a system with egalitarian inheritance (in opposition to primogeniture) and how to replace the power of an extraordinary founder with an institutional structure that offers a governance less spectacular but more sustainable.</p><p>In the case of a platform, transparent rules, the creation of dispute arbitration bodies, and the participation of users in the design of the operation rules seem steps that would ease the transition between the founder\u2019s omnipotence and the institutional (and probably regulated) future which certainly awaits Amazon. Bezos' first duty is to seek a successor, and no human successor should amass the kind of power he has. The political example of Washington is also valid for business.</p><h2>Conspicuous donations</h2><p>Well, finally we come to the bednets and the grants. Amazon is a successful company, and over time, its growth will level off, and the marginal return on investment will equal the cost of capital. Then, it will generate a free cash flow in excess of its investment needs, and that excess can be used to fund yachts and opera houses, or in satisfying urgent or existential human needs (or if you ask me,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4viLtxnwzMawqdPum/time-consistency-for-the-ea-community-projects-that-bridge\">in satisfying both at the same time</a>). It is that future stream of income, not the market value of the company, that is available for altruistic projects. The present value of both is similar, but the time structure of expenditure suggested by both perspectives is totally different.</p><h2>Conclusion: building an effective and sustainable altruistic elite</h2><p>The last decade has seen some disappointment with the rise of meritocracy in the United States.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.palladiummag.com/\">Palladium Magazine</a> has been the publication that has most consistently developed the theory that the (self-)annihilation of the American WASP aristocracy has given rise to a meritocratic rat race and the formation of a specialized and hyper-competitive&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.palladiummag.com/2021/12/29/americas-late-ruling-class/\">pseudo-elite</a> equally capable of extraordinary technical refinements and monstrous political mistakes.</p><p>The argument seems plausible to me: however, it is easier to point out the void than to fill it. The American elite was united by a religious (Protestantism) and political (economic liberalism and republicanism) ideology, and by a series of tastes and rituals that were reinforced by that ideology, and that created powerful social bonds. A WASP aristocratic restoration is impossible, among other things because the socio-economic conditions of national capitalism in which that elite was optimal no longer exist, but also because the beliefs of that class are largely outdated beyond recover.&nbsp;</p><p>The reactionary and identitarian games (be it the woke revolution or the Trumpist reaction) of the last two decades are not only sterile, but also unnecessary. The countries of the West are vastly more equal from the perspectives of race, gender and sexual orientation than at any time before and the progress has been explosive. It is economic inequality and a certain stagnation of median income where the consequences of globalization and social apathy have manifested themselves in recent decades. The natural way to deal with these problems is to deepen the instruments we already have: more competitive markets and a welfare state designed according to the principles of incentive compatibility.</p><p>The Western elite needs to regain its self-confidence, and the rehabilitation of utilitarianism in the form of Effective Altruism has the immense advantage of being an ideology that is solid, modern (or even better: classical, that is, eternally young), universalistic and existentially optimistic.</p><p>However, to be an ideology capable of articulating an elite, efficient altruism has to emphasize the sustainability <i>of that elite itself and of the society it leads</i>. Of course, what is not sustainable cannot be effective (I am not going to argue for this statement: any argument will always be weaker than the confident affirmation of this self-evident principle).</p><p>If the effective altruism proposal to Jeff Bezos and his heirs is \u201c<i>sell your company to a Japanese zaibatsu or a Russian oligarchic family and spend the money on bednets and grants</i>\u201d, success would be worse than failure.</p><p>On the contrary, the effective proposal for the high corporate owner\u2019s aristocracy is: i) the preservation of their own existence with a sustainable birth rate, a sense of social purpose and focus on wealth preservation, ii) support for a republican corporate governance inclusive of all stakeholders, and in the case of platforms, designed to foster a competitive ecology, iii) genuine altruism in the use of political influence, iv) the use of business surplus more for conspicuous (and effective!) altruism than for conspicuous consumption or display. Let it be clear, however, that utilitarianism recommends moderation, never asceticism.</p><p>These principles, <i>like utilitarianism itself</i>, may seem old, but in reality, they are as eternal as the teachings of Epicurus or Aristotle.</p><h2>References</h2><p>Khan, Lisa, \u201c&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yalelawjournal.org/note/amazons-antitrust-paradox\">Amazon's Antitrust Paradox\u201d&nbsp;</a>, The Yale Law Journal, 2017</p><p>Also posted in \"Less Wrong\" and \"Progress\" Forum\".</p>", "user": {"username": "Arturo Macias"}}, {"_id": "DsoJiHACWoaTDqhvd", "title": "Who's building Software Products?", "postedAt": "2022-12-04T12:42:55.699Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Who's building Software Products that have the potential to make a significant positive impact?</p><p>I can think of:<br>- <a href=\"https://centreforeffectivealtruism.org\">CentreForEffectiveAltruism.org</a> (EA Forum)<br>- <a href=\"https://LightconeInfrastructure.com\">LightconeInfrastructure.com</a> (LessWrong)<br>- <a href=\"https://OurWorldInData.org\">OurWorldInData.org</a><br>- <a href=\"https://Metaculus.com\">Metaculus.com</a><br>- <a href=\"https://Ought.com\">Ought.com</a><br>- 80,000 Hours' <a href=\"https://jobs.80000hours.org/\">Job Board</a><br>- <a href=\"https://GiveMomentum.com\">GiveMomentum.com</a><br>- <a href=\"https://Wave.com\">Wave.com</a><br>- <a href=\"https://MindEase.io\">MindEase.io</a><br><br>Self-promotion is welcome :)</p>", "user": {"username": "defun"}}, {"_id": "gQKozf9QbHpXLm3C7", "title": "Applications for EAGx LatAm closing on the 20th of December", "postedAt": "2022-12-04T12:25:29.759Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This is just a short announcement that you can&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eaglobal.org/events/eagx-latam/\"><u>now apply to EAGx LatAm,</u></a> which will take place<strong> in Mexico City on January 6-8.</strong> For more information, you can read our previous announcement&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/KkPo9cpLThWyd7yju/save-the-date-eagx-latam\"><u>here.</u></a> Apologies for the delay in getting this post out, but we had to postpone it for circumstances beyond our control.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:54.8%\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1670156731/mirroredImages/gQKozf9QbHpXLm3C7/jjvyufhk2r62wjsel70d.png\"><figcaption>Design by Carolina Oliveira</figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cHow to do the most good\u201d is a very hard problem and no isolated community will solve it on its own.

The unfortunate fact is that it\u2019s easier for some to hear about EA and&nbsp;<i>be heard&nbsp;</i>in EA, for reasons that have nothing to do with talent on one side or ill intent on the other, and everything to do with visas, the language you happened to be raised with, your socioeconomic background or environment. We believe that EA\u2019s current blindspots can be identified by brilliant minds all over the world, and we want to promote spaces for more people to come together, learn and bring their unique perspectives to the conversation.</p><p>We have almost finalised the programme. You can expect to see sessions to discuss community building in Low and Middle Income Countries and meet organisations working on top EA areas outside of the UK and the US. We will also have the usual EAGx suspects, including intro talks about Global Health and Development, AI Safety, Animal Welfare or Global Catastrophic Risks. We have confirmed speakers from GWWC, CEA, Charity Entrepreneurship, JPAL, Open Philanthropy, IPA, Rethink Priorities and the World Bank, among many others. Rob Wiblin will come to <s>practice his Spanish</s> talk about Career Prioritisation and Toby Ord will join us virtually to discuss longtermism in the context of the Global South.</p><p>This conference is mainly for those who are from Latin America or have ties to the continent, because they are the ones for whom it\u2019s most difficult to attend events elsewhere and connect with people who face similar struggles. But as we were saying before, we don\u2019t believe in isolated communities and we certainly wouldn\u2019t want to build a segregated EA LatAm community! On the contrary, we see this as an opportunity for connection. We\u2019re therefore looking forward to receiving experienced members of the international community who are excited to meet talented people who might be under their radar \u2013to talk with them, mentor them, learn from them, collaborate with them, hire them. On the other hand, if you\u2019re new to EA, willing to learn more and based in a region that hosts regular EA conferences (e.g. the US, Europe), we suggest one of those might be a better fit for you to be introduced to the movement.</p><p>If in doubt, err on the side of applying.</p><p><br>And no, you don\u2019t need to speak Spanish to join us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you\u2019re asking for funding to cover your travel expenses, bear in mind that costs in Mexico are cheap compared to Europe and the US.

We were talking many months ago and you made this really interesting comment that <strong>in many belief systems they have a way of segregating and limiting the impact of the most hardcore believers</strong>. So if you're a Christian, then the people who take it the most seriously... you can just make them monks so they don't cause that much damage to the rest of the world. Effective altruism doesn't have that, so if you're like a hardcore risk-neutral utilitarian then you're out in the world making billion dollar crypto companies.</p>\n<p>As a side note: a year ago I feel like the meme was \"oh look at these useless rationalists they're just reading blogs all day and they have all these you know mind palaces and whatever and what good are they\" and now everybody's like \"oh these neutral utilitarians are gonna wager our entire civilization in these 51:49 schemes\".</p>\n<p><strong>Byrne Hobart</strong> <em>1:13:17</em></p>\n<p>Yeah I think it's a useful pattern to observe because it goes back to the point that human nature just doesn't change all that fast, to the extent that it ever does. And different civilizations have had this problem of \"okay we've got some rules and we've got these beliefs\" and they're generally going to guide people to behave the right way and they're going to guide people to be the right kind of normal person and <em>not</em> to be someone whose life is entirely defined by this incredibly strict rigid moral code\u2014and by whatever you get if you take the premises of that code and just extrapolate them linearly as far as they can go.</p>\n<p>I think that gets especially dangerous with really smart people because you can give them a set of first principles and they can ask really interesting questions and come up with edge cases and sometimes for some people... the first philosophy class where they encounter these edge cases they just reject it as stupid. [... ] I think that it is useful to keep in mind that the thought experiments are designed to be implausible, and they are supposed to be intuition pumps, but the more you get this complicated highly abstract economy where an increasing share of it is software interacting with software... well software doesn't have that common-sense break on behavior. And if you have this very composable economy you can find cases where first-principles thinking actually is action-guiding and can guide you to extreme behaviors. Unfortunately those extreme behaviors are things like trading cryptocurrencies with lots and lots of leverage.</p>\n<p>You know, it's maybe merciful that the the atoms-to-bits interface has not been fully completed while we still have time to deal with malevolent unfriendly EA. But yeah it is a problem that you see a lot. <strong>And you see a lot of different societies and they do tend to have some kind of safety valve. Where if you really think that praying all day is the thing you should do, you should go do it somewhere else and you shouldn't really be part of what we're doing.</strong></p>\n<p>I think that's healthy. I think in some cases it's a temporary thing: you get it out of your system and either you come back as this totally cynical person who doesn't believe in any of it or you come back as someone who is still deeply religious and is willing to integrate with society in in a productive way. I think even within the monastic system you have different levels of engagement with the outside world and different levels of interaction.</p>\n<p>So I think that's something that EA should take seriously as an observation, <strong>as a design pattern for societies. You typically don't want the people in charge to be the most fanatical people</strong>. And EA beliefs do tend to correlate with being a very effective shape-rotator or a very effective symbol-manipulator, and those skills are very lucrative and money does have some exchange with power. **So you basically have a system where very smart people can become very powerful. And if very smart people can also become very crazy then you tend to increase the correlation between power and craziness. And it doesn't take very long clicking through Wikipedia articles on various leaders in world history to see that you ideally do not want your powerful people to be all that crazy or your crazy people to be all that powerful. **</p>\n<p>As far as what to actually do about that... <strong>I think one model is that smart people should be advisors but not in an executive capacity.</strong> Like they shouldn't be executives or like you don't want the smartest person in the organization also being the person who makes the final decisions, for various reasons. But you do want them around: you want the person making final decisions to be like reasonably smart\u2014smart enough they understand what the smart person is telling them and why that might be wrong, what the flaws might be.</p>\n<p>So that might be one model: you want the EAs dispersed throughout different organizations of the world\u2014as someone working with non-EAs and kind of nudging them in an EA-friendly direction, giving them helpful advice but not actually being the executive.</p>\n<p><strong>One possibility is that every other society got it wrong and the monastic tradition was stupid and it has been independently discovered by numerous stupid civilizations that have all been around for much longer than effective altruism.</strong> So that's a possibility\u2014you can't discount it\u2014but I think <strong>if you run the probabilities it's probably not the case.</strong></p>\n<h2>The leaders who \"take ideas seriously\" don't necessarily have a great track record</h2>\n<p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong> <em>1:17:54</em></p>\n<p>I mean in general it's always a little bit... <strong>the leaders who take ideas seriously don't necessarily have a great track record, right?! Like Stalin apparently had a library of like 20,000 books.</strong> If you listen to Putin's speech on Ukraine it's laden with all kinds of historical references. Obviously you know there's like many ways you can disagree with it, but it's like a man of ideas and <strong>do you want a man of ideas in charge of important institutions? It's not clear.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Byrne Hobart</strong> 1:18:31\nWell the Founding Fathers, a lot of them were wordsmiths and we basically have whole collections of anons flaming each other through pamphlets. So yeah in one sense it was a nation of nerds. On the other hand Washington didn't\u2014as far as I know\u2014have huge contributions to that literary corpus. So maybe that is actually the model: <strong>you want the nerds, you want them to debate things, you want the debates to either reach interesting conclusions or at least tell you where the fault lines are, like what are the things nobody can actually come to a good agreement on. And then you want someone who is not quite that smart, not really into flame wars to actually make the final call.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong> <em>1:19:07</em></p>\n<p>Yeah, that's a really good point. I mean like forget about Jefferson... <strong>imagine if Thomas Paine was made president of the United States. That would be very bad news...</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Byrne Hobart</strong> <em>1:19:17</em></p>\n<p>Yeah. <strong>It's important to note that it's better to have some level of fanaticism than no fanaticism.</strong> There's like an optimal amount of thymos and there's an optimal place for it but... I think from a totally cynical perspective your most thymotic people, maybe they are at the front lines doing things and taking risks but also not making the decisions about who goes to the front lines, or I think the other thing is making sure that the person deciding where the front lines are and saying the front line is like \"we keep France safe from the invaders\" and not \"the front line is Moscow so get to Moscow and burn it down\".</p>\n<p>There's a recent Napoleon biography that I'm also in the middle of\u2014it's been a good year for reading about power-tripping people\u2014it points out that technically Napoleon had more countries declare war on him than he declared war on. So on average France was fighting defensive wars during the Napoleonic era. It's just you know they kept defending farther and farther from France.</p>\n<p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong> <em>1:20:24</em></p>\n<p>Yeah defense requires some strange kinds of offense, often.</p>\n<h2>If we eyeball the track-record of two kinds of investment thesis\u2014\u201cBig worldview\u201d vs \u201cmicro-level observations\u201d\u2014the greats have some synthesis of the two, and it probably leans more towards big worldview.</h2>\n<p><strong>Dwarkesh Patel</strong> _1:20:30</p>\n<p>Okay so one meta question I've had is: when you're trying to figure out which charities do the most good [...] there's two kinds of discourse: there's one that's like \"we've got these few dozen RCTs and let's see how we can extrapolate the data from these in the least theory-laden way\" and there's another where it's like \"I've just read a shit ton of classics and I'm like a thinking person I think a lot about culture and philosophy and here's my big intricate worldview about how these things are going to shape out\". And investing is an interesting realm because there's both kinds of people there and you can see the track records over long periods of time. So having seen this track record, <strong>is there any indication to you whether this first sort of microeconomic approach actually leads to better concrete results than somebody like Thiel or Soros who are motivated by a sort of intricate worldview that's based on philosophy or something? Which one actually makes better concrete predictions, that are actionable?</strong></p>\n<p>Byrne Hobart** <em>1:21:41</em></p>\n<p>So I think <strong>typically the greats have some synthesis of the two and it probably leans more towards big worldview than towards micro-level observations.</strong></p>\n<p>One way to divide things is to say that the quants are into all these micro-level observations: like you could be a quant who does not actually know what the numbers mean. [You're] just looking for patterns and find them and people have done it that way but it seems like quantitative strategies get more successful when you find some anomaly and then you find an <em>explanation</em> for the anomaly. And the explanation might be some psychological factor you've identified. And maybe you find studies indicating that loss-aversion is real and this affects how fast stocks go down versus how fast they should often go down, and that gives you a trading strategy. Or maybe it's something more mundane, like maybe there is some large investor who has some policy like \"we rebalance between stocks and bonds on the first day of every quarter\" and if you know that the investors who have that policy control X trillion dollars of assets and you know how they'll rebalance then at the end of every quarter you know money is sloshing between stocks and bonds and that's predictable. A lot of the quantitative strategies that have those theories behind them tend to blow up more rarely, because they sort of know why the strategy works and then they know why it'll stop working.</p>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<p>On the other end if you have these just totally theory-driven views... <strong>usually what kills totally abstract theory-driven views is time. Because a lot of the best abstract theories are you look at some part of the economy you say \"this is obviously unsustainable\" and then the problem is you can say that at any point during its arc and it can look sustainable to other people for a very long time.</strong></p>\n", "user": {"username": "Peter_Hartree"}}, {"_id": "buEazpmcKJhM5KRGx", "title": "SFF Speculation Grants as an expedited funding source", "postedAt": "2022-12-03T18:34:10.738Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi everyone, SFF has received numerous emails recently from organizations interested in expedited funding. &nbsp;I believe a number of people here already know about SFF Speculation Grants, but since we've never actually announced our existence on the EA Forum before:</p><p>The <a href=\"https://survivalandflourishing.fund/\">Survival and Flourishing Fund</a> has a means of expediting funding requests at any time of year, via applications to our Speculation Grants program:</p><p><a href=\"https://survivalandflourishing.fund/speculation-grants\">https://survivalandflourishing.fund/speculation-grants</a></p><blockquote><p>SFF Speculation Grants are expedited grants organized by SFF outside of our biannual grant-recommendation process (the <a href=\"http://survivalandflourishing.fund/s-process/\">S-process</a>). \u201cSpeculation Grantors\u201d are volunteers with budgets to make these grants.

I don\u2019t assert that any of the concerns in it are overwhelming, only that we have too quickly adopted a set of media communication practices without discussing their trade-offs.</i></p><p><i>Also, while this was in draft form, Shakeel Hashim, CEA\u2019s new head of communications, made some positive comments on the main thesis suggesting that he agreed with a lot of my criticisms and planned to have a much more active involvement with the media. If so, this post may be largely redundant - nonetheless, it seems worth having the conversation in public.</i></p><p>CEA adheres to what they call the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/blog/the-fidelity-model-of-spreading-ideas\"><u>fidelity model of spreading ideas</u></a>, which they formally introduced in 2017, though my sense is it was an unofficial policy well before that. In a low-fidelity nutshell, this is the claim that EA ideas are somewhat nuanced and media reporting often isn\u2019t, and so it\u2019s generally not worth pursuing - and often worth actively discouraging - media communication unless you\u2019re a) extremely confident the outlet in question will report the ideas exactly as you describe them and b) you\u2019re qualified to deal with the media.</p><p>In practice, because CEA pull many strings, this being CEA policy makes it de facto EA policy.&nbsp; \u2018Qualified to deal with the media\u2019 seems to mean \u2018CEA-sanctioned\u2019, and I have heard of at least one organisation being denied CEA-directed money in part because it was considered too accommodating of the media. Given that ubiquity, I think it\u2019s worth discussing the policy more depth. We have five years of results to look back on and, to my knowledge, no further public discussion of the subject. I have four key concerns with the current approach:</p><ul><li>It\u2019s not grounded in research</li><li>It leads to a high proportion of negative coverage for EA</li><li>It assumes a Platonic ideal of EA</li><li>It contributes to the hero-worship/concentration of power in EA</li></ul><p>Elaborating each\u2026</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Not empirically grounded</h2><p>The article assumes that low-fidelity spreading of EA ideas is necessarily bad, but doesn\u2019t give any data beyond some very general anecdotes to support this. There\u2019s an obvious trade-off to be had between a small number of people doing something a lot like what we want and a larger number doing something a bit like what we want, and it\u2019s very unclear which has higher expectation.&nbsp;</p><p>To see the case for the alternative, we might compare the rise of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_rights\"><u>animal rights</u></a> movement in the wake of Peter Singer\u2019s original argument for animal&nbsp;<i>welfare</i>. The former is a philosophically mutated version of the latter, so on fidelity model reasoning would have been something that\u2019s \u2018similar but different\u2019 - apparently treated on the fidelity model as undesirable. Similarly, the emergence of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reducetarian.org/\"><u>reducetarianism</u></a>/<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flexitarianism\"><u>flexitarianism</u></a> looks very like what the fidelity model would consider to be a \u2018diluted\u2019 version of the practice of veganism Singer advocated. My sense is that both of these have nonetheless been strong net positives for animal welfare.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h2>High proportion of negative coverage</h2><p>If you have influence over a group of supporters and you tell them not to communicate with the media, one result you might anticipate is that a much higher proportion of your media coverage comes from the&nbsp;<i>detractors</i>, who you don\u2019t have influence over. Shutting out the media can also be counterproductive - they\u2019re (mostly) human, and so tend to deal more kindly with people who deal more kindly with them. I have three supporting anecdotes, one admittedly eclipsing the others:</p><h3>FTXgate</h3><p>At the time of writing, if you Google \u2018effective altruism news\u2019, you still get something like this.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1670509418/mirroredImages/q2M9DDoogZGTJjQbg/uzezbw4j2qnawpn16co3.png\"></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, if you look at Will\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/willmacaskill/status/1591218014707671040\"><u>Tweetstorm</u></a> decrying SBF\u2019s actions, the majority of responses are angrily negative responses to a movement that consorted with crypto billionaires, as though that\u2019s all EA has ever been about. It seems we\u2019ll to have to deal with this being the first impression many people have formed of the movement for quite some time.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>\u2018The child abuse thing\u2019</h3><p>A few years ago I was at a public board games event. Sitting at the table to introduce myself with my usual social flair, I decided to mention that I was into EA as a conversation starter. My neighbour\u2019s response was \u2018effective altruism\u2026 oh right - the child abuse thing.\u2019</p><p>I won\u2019t link to the source that informed that delightful conversation, but in brief: a former EA with serious mental health issues had committed suicide after allegedly being sexually harassed by rationalists and/or EAs - she had written an online suicide note that didn\u2019t distinguish between the two groups, and that made a lot of allegations against the broader communities, most of which I believe demonstratedly lacked justification. But evidently, this was passed around widely enough by people who disliked the movement that it was literally the only thing my interlocutor had heard of us.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>\u2018Noisy fuckers\u2019</h3><p>Shortly after CEEALAR (then the EA Hotel) was founded, I was contacted by an&nbsp;<i>Economist</i> journalist excited about the project who wanted to write about it. Not knowing then of the CEA policy I invited him to come and view it. I mentioned this to a friend, who informed me of the CEA policy and, on the basis of it, strongly urged us not to engage.* So we backtracked and asked the journalist not to visit. He did anyway, and we literally turned him away at the front door. You can read the article&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/britain/2018/09/06/effective-altruists-aim-to-change-the-world-from-a-blackpool-hotel\"><u>here</u></a><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5ulu0ztg0vf\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5ulu0ztg0vf\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and form your own opinions - mine is that the last paragraph feels very like a substitution for what would have been an engaged look at what people were doing in the hotel if we hadn\u2019t both reduced the substance of the journalist\u2019s story and presumably pissed him off in the process.</p><p>*[edit: she pointed out in the comments this was mostly advice from her own experience, not based on CEA policy</p><p>edit 2: to be clear, we weren't aware of any pressure from CEA to do so - just that they had published articles advising against engaging with journalists]</p><h2>Assumes a Platonic ideal of EA</h2><p>One of the most acclaimed forum posts of all time (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/allPosts?sortedBy=topAdjusted\"><u>karma adjusted</u></a>) is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/FpjQMYQmS3rWewZ83/effective-altruism-is-a-question-not-an-ideology\"><u>Effective Altruism is a Question (not an Ideology)</u></a>. It is hard to square the letter of that post, let alone the spirit, with the thought that sharing EA ideas among the masses will distort them into ideas that are \u2018related to, but importantly different from, the ideas we want to spread\u2019 - and that this will necessarily be a bad outcome.&nbsp;</p><p>The fidelity article describes EA as \u2018nuanced\u2019, but honestly, I don\u2019t think it particularly is at its core. People who publicly condemn it don\u2019t seem to have got any factual details&nbsp;<i>wrong.</i> They either have a different emotional response to it, or they\u2019re critical of how it\u2019s put into practice. In the former case, maybe there was nothing we could have done - or maybe more exposure would have made the ideas feel more normal. In the latter case, if we withhold the logic behind these practices, we give up ~8 billion chances for it to be improved by critical scrutiny.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h2>Contributes to the hero-worship and the concentration of power in EA</h2><p>To my knowledge, there have been three major EA publicity campaigns. The first was the launch of Giving What We Can, which in practice (and to his chagrin) focused the attention on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20100225110211/https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1228043/I-1m-charity-says-Oxford-don-33-000-salary.html\"><u>Toby Ord</u></a> more than his project. The second - and arguably ongoing - was the launch around&nbsp;<i>Doing Good Better</i>, which intentionally put Will in the spotlight: during and since, he has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIdxzkOqK_o\"><u>given</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rdPRXfbfSys\"><u>multiple</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qslo4-DpzPs\"><u>high-profile</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.samharris.org/podcasts/making-sense-episodes/228-doing-good\"><u>interviews</u></a> and CEA pays for dozens of copies of the book to be given away at every EA conference. The most recent - and arguably ongoing - was the launch around&nbsp;<i>What We Owe the Future</i>, which intentionally put Will in the spotlight: during and since he has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/09/podcasts/transcript-ezra-klein-interviews-will-macaskill.html\"><u>given</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LzFOVXNk4i4\"><u>multiple</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QkB3Zq3zoR4\"><u>high-profile</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9C41fx64dw\"><u>interviews</u></a>, and CEA seem to intend to pay for dozens of copies to be given away at every future EA conference. To a lesser degree,&nbsp;<i>The Precipice</i> has also been supported, again being given away by the dozen at EA conferences.</p><p>Will and Toby are arguably the main founders of the EA movement, so it\u2019s natural to focus on them to some extent - but this effect can still cause a feedback loop that amplifies their opinions beyond what seems epistemically healthy.</p><p>Also, identifying the movement with a small number of individuals creates a huge failure mode, which we might be in the middle of facing. If Will\u2019s reputation is tarnished by the above association with FTX, however unfairly, the movement will suffer, to say nothing of the fact that SBF himself was one of the few EAs whose media engagement was encouraged. Even if those associations fade over time, the risk remains that highlighting a very small number of thought leaders inevitably gives the movement critical points of failure.&nbsp;</p><p>It may also be bad for Will himself, since it puts him under an incredible amount of pressure to adhere to middle-of-the-road social norms, some of which he may be uncomfortable with.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Some (over?)generalisations of the concern</h2><p>I have a couple of broader hypotheses about shortcomings of EA epistemics to which this is related.

Tapping these supplies provided food security during<br>dry years, multiplied agricultural yields during normal or wet years, and provided<br>the foundation for supporting the rise of population from 2B to 7B. We are now<br>dependent on routine use of resources that date from decades to millions of<br>years back. Although there are exceptions, such as the United States Geological<br>Survey\u2019s (USGS) tracking of groundwater depletion in the US, the world at large<br>has been using this resource without measuring consumption rates or how<br>much is left. Globally, we have been withdrawing from a bank account without<br>knowing how much we are pulling out or if the account is almost empty.</p><p><br>For the first time, we know. The picture is surprising and not good. Recently,<br>NASA has released images, analysis and multi-year comparison studies from the<br>GRACE satellites that give the first pictures of the state of groundwater usage<br>and groundwater reserves by measuring changes in gravity. The findings show<br>imminent and developing water crises across the world\u2019s major agricultural areas<br>and population centers due to over withdrawal of groundwater. To put this in<br>perspective, outside of the shrinking of the polar ice caps and glaciers, the<br>biggest single point of contribution to rising ocean levels came from groundwater<br>pumping around New Delhi, India. To put it in the context of how big a surprise<br>the data delivers, the water loss from New Delhi turned out to be 70% larger than<br>the Indian estimates had predicted. The satellite data offers a global, quantified,<br>objective view of the invisible, irreversible overspending of a huge percentage<br>world\u2019s storehouse of water.</p><p><br>News reports from Syria and Iraq about population flight from villages as<br>irrigation wells go dry cease to be isolated data points when placed in the big<br>picture context of the satellite data. The GRACE satellite system makes visible<br>the exhaustion of groundwater in one key region after another, beginning with<br>Saudi Arabia, the Emirates and the rest of the Middle East within the next few<br>years. India, China and the US will follow later.</p><p><br>Analyses of the data ascribe the cause of the depletions to \u201cdecades of bad<br>management and overuse,\u201d which continue unchanged. Even if global<br>conservation methods and plentiful rainfall patterns were to begin tomorrow,<br>crises would be marginally postponed; scarce rainfall or drought will accelerate<br>them. The numbers and trends have mass and momentum: they show that we<br>have been supporting a global population through living beyond our water bank<br>account. The published scientific papers use words such as \u201calarming.\u201d</p><p><br>Update 2022: The groundwater depletion described above has continued and<br>increased. The prediction of imminent trouble deriving from groundwater<br>depletion promptly came true. The news reports of Syrian farmers abandoning<br>their farms and Yemen\u2019s Houthi fleeing as their wells ran dry led first to civil wars<br>in their respective countries, and then to humanitarian disasters, refugee flight<br>and international wars involving ISIS versus the US in Syria, and Iran versus<br>Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates in Yemen.</p><p><br>During our 2014 meeting with Secretary Shultz and Secretary Mattis, we made<br>the comment that NASA publishes maps that show you where the next wars will<br>be. This has statement has been borne out. The US Department of State is<br>now interested in deploying water technologies into these water crisis points to<br>stop the next wars.</p><p><br>A range of other consequences of groundwater depletion also occurred. For<br>example, the flight of over 1 million refugees from Africa who crossed the<br>Mediterranean into Europe was also initiated by groundwater depletion.<br>In 2022, the United States is now also deep within the crisis, although most of the<br>populations appears unaware of the problem. Although people who have direct<br>contact with water issues, e.g., farmers forced to fallow half their acreage through<br>lack of water are well aware of the situation, the vast US population remains<br>either unaware or \u2013 as described in an article in The Atlantic - in denial. &nbsp;An Aug.<br>25, 2022 interview with James Famiglietti, who led the GRACE data analysis<br>summarized the situation: \u201cThe Colorado River crisis is urgent, Famiglietti said,<br>but the hidden, underground water crisis is even worse.

We are a nonprofit dedicated to maximizing our social impact, and although I'm certainly biased I think we are in impactful organization. Perhaps headhunters targeting our staff feel that the roles they are recruiting for are much higher-impact than the roles people currently have at IDinsight, and I would respect their actions if this were the case. However, I would imagine that headhunters also are motivated to fill roles, and this would hinder them from accurately weighing the global impact of someone moving from job X to job Y.&nbsp;</p><p>I do understand this is complicated. The decision to move jobs ultimately rests with the worker, not the headhunter, and I of course respect the decision of anyone to switch jobs. But I do think the EA community should be thinking strategically about how to maximize our headhunting resources for total global impact, as opposed to just impact for the organizations they are working for. &nbsp;I wonder, are there any established norms or best-practices within the community? If not, I think it would make sense to develop some. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "daniel.stein@idinsight.org"}}, {"_id": "bg4QkbRj7BCy6YnZ4", "title": "Shorttermism", "postedAt": "2022-12-03T06:06:23.895Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This is an excerpt from my <a href=\"https://www.datasecretslox.com/index.php/topic,8271.0.html\">post</a> on Data Secrets Lox, which I was advised to post here.</p><p>***</p><p>The next author was a man who looked around thirty years old. He was dressed in a black hoodie and had pale skin and a slight, brown beard. He introduced himself to Kelly as Frank Donoghue. His book was entitled \u201cThe Effective Altruist Case for Shorttermism.\u201d<br><br>\u201cShorttermism, what\u2019s that mean?\u201d Kelly asked.<br><br>\u201cIt's the idea that effective altruism should focus more on the short term. Most economists believe in the declining marginal utility of money. Effective altruists commonly accept the idea and take it to its logical conclusion, that the best use for the donor\u2019s dollar is to help the person experiencing extreme poverty in the third world. Short-termism is another logical outcome of this idea. People in the future should be expected to be richer than people in the present. Ergo, we should direct more of our charitable efforts toward the present.\u201d<br><br>Paul thought about it for a few seconds. \u201cOkay, give me a concrete example. How should altruists behave differently, informed by this theory?\u201d<br><br>\u201cMany wealthy people plan to give their money away after they die. But consider this. In 1990, there were 2 billion people living in extreme poverty. Now, it\u2019s 700 million. In East Asia, that number has gone from nearly a billion to almost zero. India\u2019s making slower but still steady progress. By 2030, if you believe the forecasts, almost all extreme poverty will be concentrated in Africa. If Africa makes the same progress, by 2050, there may be nobody experiencing extreme poverty. So if you\u2019ve got money you\u2019re saving to donate, you should donate now, you are <i>certain</i> there are people in extreme poverty you can help, rather than save it for the future where there <i>might</i> be people you can help.\u201d<br><br>\u201cConvincing,\u201d Paul said. \u201cBut then, I fear this may not be a very popular message. I bet many of those who say they are saving to donate are actually thinking, \u2018I might donate, but on the other hand, this can also be my rainy-day fund.\u2019 They won\u2019t want to hear this message.\u201d<br><br>\u201cRight. But many will want to hear the next message, for it gives them a \u2018principled\u2019 reason for doing what they wanted to do anyway.\u201d<br><br>\u201cAnd what is that?\u201d<br><br>\u201cConsider carbon emissions. Now, I\u2019m not convinced that the costs of a warming world will exceed the benefits. But even if they will, that doesn\u2019t mean we are obligated to reduce carbon emissions. Consider this. Median household income in the US is around 70K a year. If you assume a real economic growth rate of 1.5% a year, our descendants a hundred years from now will have 4.4 times what we do. Suppose that reducing our carbon emissions would cost us each 2K a year. It will save our descendants 8K a year because they won\u2019t have to \u2018clean up our mess.\u2019 Should we really go from 70K a year to 68K a year so that someone else can go from 300K a year to 308K a year? Seems like redistribution in the opposite direction, don\u2019t you think?\u201d<br><br>\u201cBut aren\u2019t our descendants owed a non-polluted world? I recall a quote somebody said, \u2018the planet is not something your ancestors have given you. It is something you have borrowed from your descendants.\u2019\u201d<br><br>\u201cBorrowing implies an agreement made voluntarily by two sides. I never signed any such agreement. Of course, if we are giving them a horribly polluted biosphere, one in which they could barely breathe, then yes, that\u2019s a real moral dilemma. But carbon dioxide is not that. At the still-minute concentrations we are spewing into the atmosphere, it has no negative impacts on human health. It makes the world slightly warmer and floods a tiny amount of beachfront land, which is hardly a problem considering how underpopulated the world is.\u201d<br><br>\u201cSo what we owe the future is \u2026 not much?\u201d<br><br>\u201cYes. Consider what happened when you were born. Did the world say, \u2018welcome to existence, human being; here\u2019s a basket of stocks and bonds and land?\u2019 No. Of course, many do inherit assets from their parents, but we don\u2019t consider it something they are <i>entitled</i> to. Why should we consider someone born a hundred years ago entitled to some beachfront land that we could cause to flood? Why is it important for him to have it, to go with his flying car, robot servant, and cancer cures? Seems like we \u2018need\u2019 it more.\u201d<br><br>\u201cI see a problem here. You\u2019re only focusing on the developed world. Yes, our descendants may be fabulously rich. But what of people in the developing world? They are the ones who will be screwed by this climate change stuff.\u201d<br><br>\u201cMaybe. But consider they, too, will be richer than their grandparents. Rather than spend our money on green energy subsidies, why not send the money to people living in the third world now? Again, we may never again get the chance to help people in extreme poverty.\u201d<br><br>\u201cThere\u2019s no possibility for graft and crony capitalism with pure cash transfers.\u201d<br><br>\u201cYes, but we could have the government buy things and then ship them to the third world. We could ally ourselves with big Ag, big pharma, and the fossil fuel industry. I expect Exxon to pay people to shill this book.\u201d</p>", "user": {"username": "Alexander_Turok"}}, {"_id": "wph9LGoT8dGpzjuZa", "title": "Announcing FTX Community Response Survey", "postedAt": "2022-12-02T17:13:00.399Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>TL;DR:</strong> Let us know how you are feeling about EA post the FTX crisis by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_1NfgYhwzvlNGUom?source=eaforum2\"><u>filling out the EA survey</u></a>.

However with evidence of benefits of cash transfers across a range of development spheres (Health, education, income), should every new development intervention should have to be proved better than Cash transfers? Is there any point in seeing whether an intervention is beneficial vs. doing nothing at all, or should the bar now be higher for both practical and Ethical reasons? Should cash transfers be our new standard benchmark for any development intervention?</p><p>I was triggered to write this post after <a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03966833\">checking out this RCT</a> which investigates whether StrongMinds group psychotherapy can help teenagers. I wondered why the control arm gave people nothing at all, rather than a cash transfer of about 150 dollars \u2013 the cost of psychotherapy for each person?<br>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Practical considerations</strong></h3><p>I have developed intervention X, a voice robot which automatically calls pregnant mothers &nbsp;in low income countries to remind them 2 days before each antenatal appointment and then every day a week before their scheduled delivery date. I want to test whether Intervention X improves infant mortality, infant weight at birth and 6 weeks, and the percent of mothers who deliver their baby while cared for by a skilled health worker. Implementing Intervention X will cost 50 dollars per mother. We know that cash transfers to the mother <a href=\"https://adc.bmj.com/content/103/10/920\">can potentially improve infant outcomes</a>, so why not make the control arm a <i><strong>50 dollar cash transfer a week before the delivery date rather than no intervention at all</strong></i>? This will give us the practical result we want for real world use. Should we use and scale up intervention X &nbsp;for babies, or would we be better giving a $50 cash transfer?</p><p>The cash transfer amount in the trial should be roughly equivalent to the real cost of the intervention to be tested. Giving more or less wouldn't make sense as you then couldn't do a meaningful cost-effectiveness comparison - you would be testing apples vs oranges (or perhaps bigger apples with smaller apples)</p><p>And fortunately there are few practical barriers to using cash transfers as a control. We can now give almost anyone anywhere a cash transfer through phones. Obviously the transfers will add cost to our study, but apart from cost there aren't big practical barriers.</p><h3><br><strong>Are Development RCTs vs nothing unethical? (high uncertainty)</strong></h3><p>Given that cash transfers can work on a variety of fronts, is there now an ethical problem in giving people nothing in the control arm of an a development RCT? In medical RCTs (the OG RCTs ;) if you know a medication works, say for High Blood pressure, then any new blood pressure medication is not pitted against no medication at all, it is pitted against the previous \u201cstandard of care\u201d as not to deny participants a treatment that we know works just for the sake of our research. Giving them nothing wouldn\u2019t be fair. Is it fair now to give people nothing in control arms of development RCTs, when there is a high likelihood that transfers would provide a benefit?<br><br>Also, is it fair to subject people to trials which might not have practical use even if the trial is \"successful\"? If intervention X <i><strong>improves outcomes by 1%</strong></i>, while we already know that cash transfers<i><strong> improves outcomes by 2%</strong></i>. Is it right to subject people to research that might find a real effect, but an effect that is not practically useful in the real world because cash works better. Ethically, should cash transfer become the standard which every other intervention needs to beat to be considered an ethically sound intervention?<br>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Counter arguments and other comments</strong></h3><p>There are strong counter arguments \u2013 &nbsp;One that there is value in seeing if intervention X works at all, even if it is doesn\u2019t meet the cash transfer benchmark. Perhaps intervention X can later be developed to perform better than cash transfers in future. If we set the \"cash transfer standard\" fro the start, we &nbsp;may write off good ideas early in their development stage, before they have the chance to develop and become better than cash transfers. I would argue though that even if early studies are vs. a control of nothing, at least the second stage of trials should be vs. Cash transfers. Also there is the possibility of having both a cash transfer control arm, and a no intervention control arm.</p><p>Another counter argument is that &nbsp;evidence for efficacy of cash transfers across all spheres of development may not yet strong enough to consider it a standard. &nbsp;<br><br>To be clear, many interventions have been shown to probably be more effective than cash transfers \u2013 I don't argue that cash transfers are the best intervention for everything, or that we shouldn\u2019t be innovating and trialling many new interventions. Just that they perhaps should now be the standard control arm for development RCTs</p><p>Obviously there will be many exceptions where a control arm of cash transfers doesn\u2019t make sense, like for example comparing a new type of bednet to an old one.</p><p>This may have been discussed in detail before, so apologies if there are other posts which cover this which I have missed \u2013 I did a search and couldn\u2019t find any on a cursory look.

Put simply, the initial hypothesis is that neuron counts are an indicator for intelligence (and potentially capacity to experience pain), and therefore how much relative importance we should give different animals.&nbsp;</p><p>This post argues that using neuron counts alone is not a good proxy for moral weights, for the following reasons:</p><ul><li><strong>Information-processing capacity&nbsp;</strong>(relevant to experiencing pain) is not just determined by neuron count, but also distance between neurons, number of synapses, conduction velocity of neurons and other factors.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Intelligence -&nbsp;</strong>It seems possible that one could experience more intense sensations (e.g. pain) without being more intelligent.

In particular, I argue that there is no known principle of interpersonal aggregation that yields acceptable results in variable population contexts and is consistent with a plausible ideal of respect for others\u2019 risk attitudes in fixed population cases.</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>The long-run future is highly uncertain, as are the effects of present actions on posterity. In order to be able to make reasonable decisions that take account of the potential long-term impact of our choices today, we therefore need to know how to rationally manage uncertainty in decision-making.</p><p>According to orthodox decision theory, a rational agent in conditions of uncertainty prefers those acts that maximize expected utility (Arnauld and Nicole 1662; Bernoulli 1738; Ramsey 1926; von Neumann and Morgenstern 1947; Savage 1972). The utility function is assumed to be a cardinal measure of the agent\u2019s strength of preferences over outcomes, and its expectation is taken relative to a probability function representing known chances and/or the strength of the agent\u2019s beliefs about the state of the world.</p><p>In the recent philosophical literature, an influential alternative to expected utility the- ory is defended by Buchak (2013), building on earlier work by Quiggin (1982). Buchak argues for the rationality of maximizing <i>risk-weighted expected utility </i>(REU). On this view, a rational agent\u2019s preferences over uncertain prospects depend not only on the probabilities she assigns to the different possible states of the world and the desirability of the different possible outcomes, but also independently on her attitude toward risk, as captured by a risk function on probabilities.</p><p>More recently, Buchak (2016, 2017, 2019) has argued that moral contexts require that we adopt a particular attitude toward risk. We are required, she claims, to exhibit a high degree of risk avoidance as a default. This default, she claims, should especially guide those of our decisions whose largest impacts are on future individuals, such as decisions about climate change. This approach has also been claimed to have important consequences for evaluating the prospect of continued human survival and actions aimed at ensuring that our species endures. In particular, Pettigrew (2022) argues that consequentialists are pushed in the direction of favouring premature human extinction over continued human survival in light of the significant risks associated with the persistence of human beings as a dominant species.</p><p>The core idea that motivates this line of argument is that of <i>respect for others\u2019 risk attitudes</i>. When our actions affect others, we ought not simply impose our own idiosyncratic attitude toward risk on them, and should instead choose in a way that takes account of the risk attitudes of the people we potentially affect. So goes the thought. I will offer reasons to think that a plausible ideal of respect for others\u2019 risk attitudes does not support the kind of conclusions outlined above, and may even be irrelevant when thinking about the impact of present actions on the long-run future. The problem is that there is no known principle of interpersonal aggregation suitable to variable population contexts that is consistent with a plausible ideal of respect for others\u2019 risk attitudes in fixed population cases.</p><p>I begin in section 2 by outlining the theory of risk-weighted expected utility. In sec- tion 3, I then set out Buchak\u2019s view that we should default to a risk avoidant risk attitude when making choices on behalf of others, and I outline claims made by Buchak and Pettigrew about the implications of this principle for actions whose most important effects concern future people. In section 4, I emphasize an important choice that we face when we aim to respect others\u2019 risk attitudes when choosing on behalf of a group of persons: namely, whether to aggregate first across persons and then across outcomes, or <i>vice versa</i>. In section 5, I note that there is good reason to think that respect for others\u2019 risk attitudes requires that we adopt the latter approach, but that this approach is incompatible with consequentialism. In section 6, I argue that this approach also threatens to break down in variable population cases of the kind we inevitably confront in making decisions about the long-run future. The same is not true of a procedure that aggregates across persons within outcomes and then across outcomes, but this procedure cannot be justified by appeal to a plausible ideal of respect for others\u2019 risk attitudes. Section 7 provides a summary and conclusion.</p><h3><a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/respect-for-others-risk-attitudes-and-the-long-run-future-andreas-mogensen/\">Read the rest of the paper</a></h3>", "user": {"username": "Global Priorities Institute"}}, {"_id": "CLgXstmDetfPgbPEy", "title": "Update on Harvard AI Safety Team and MIT AI Alignment", "postedAt": "2022-12-02T06:09:10.095Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "Alexander Davies"}}, {"_id": "t5vFLabB2mQz2tgDr", "title": "I\u2019m a 22-year-old woman involved in Effective Altruism.

I would like to share my perspective in the hope that it may interact with and broaden yours.&nbsp;</li><li>In writing this post, my aim is not to be combative nor divisive. The values of Effective Altruism are my values (for the most part - I likely value rationality less than many), and its goals are my goals. I do not, therefore, aim to \u201ctake down\u201d or harm the Effective Altruism community. Rather, I hope to challenge us all to think about what it means to be in community.</li></ul><h3><i>Who am I and why am I writing this?</i></h3><p>I\u2019m a 22-year-old college senior, set to graduate with a degree in Human and Organizational Development in May. I learned about Effective Altruism last fall, when I transferred to a new university and started attending my school\u2019s EA events and fellowships. I have become increasingly involved in the Effective Altruism community over the past 14 months -&nbsp; participating in intro and in-depth fellowships, taking on a leadership role in my school\u2019s EA club, and attending an EAGx and an EAG.&nbsp;</p><p>So why am I writing this? Because I am at a point in my life where I have to make a lot of choices: where I want to live; what type of work I want to engage in; the people whom I want to surround myself with. When I found Effective Altruism, it seemed as though I had stumbled across a movement and a community that would provide me with guidance in all three of these areas. However, as my social and intellectual circles became increasingly entangled with EA, I grew hesitant, then skeptical, then downright sad as I observed behavior (both in-person and online) from those involved in the EA community. I\u2019m writing this because I want to be able to feel proud when I tell people that I am involved in Effective Altruism. I want to feel as if I can encourage others to join without an added list of disclaimers about the type of behavior they may encounter. Lastly, I want the Effective Altruism community to revisit and continuously strive towards what the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\"><u>Centre for Effective Altruism</u></a> calls the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/ceas-guiding-principles\"><u>core principles</u></a> of EA:&nbsp;<strong>commitment to others</strong>, scientific mindset, openness, integrity, and collaborative spirit.&nbsp;</p><h3><i>Gender and Culture</i></h3><p>According to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ThdR8FzcfA8wckTJi/ea-survey-2020-demographics\"><u>EA Survey 2020&nbsp;</u></a>(the latest year for which I could find data), the makeup of people involved in EA was very similar to that of 2019: 76% white and 71% male. Lack of diversity within movements, organizations, and \u201cintellectual projects\u201d is incredibly damaging for many important reasons. CEA writes several of these reasons on their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/diversity-and-inclusion\"><u>Diversity and Inclusion page</u></a>, but the one I would like to highlight is&nbsp;<i>We don\u2019t want to miss important perspectives.&nbsp;</i>As the website reads, \u201cif the community isn\u2019t able to welcome and encourage members who don\u2019t resemble the existing community, we will consistently miss out on the perspectives of underrepresented groups.\u201d I agree with this statement and that is why I am concerned - I\u2019m unconvinced that this community is effective in \u201cwelcoming and encouraging\u201d people who don\u2019t fit the majority white-and-man mold.&nbsp;</p><p>I question the welcoming-ness of the EA community because, despite fitting the EA mold in many ways - I\u2019m white, American, in my twenties, and will soon graduate from a highly-ranked college - I still often feel as if the EA community is not something I want to be a part of. I can imagine that those with even less of the predominant EA demographic characteristics face exponentially increased barriers to entry. Several (yet not all) instances in which I\u2019ve felt this way\u2026&nbsp;</p><ol><li>A friend visited the Bay Area this summer to spend time with several of our mutual friends (all heavily involved in EA). He casually mentioned that some of them made a list ranking women in EA in the Bay that they wanted to hook up with.&nbsp;</li><li>At an EAG afterparty, an attendee talked about how he scheduled a one-on-one with someone because he found her attractive.&nbsp;</li><li>I read&nbsp;<a href=\"https://keerthanapg.com/random/ea-women/\"><u>this</u></a> blog post and the comments and controversy it generated. The amount of invalidation and general nastiness in the comments (that have since been deleted so I won\u2019t link to them) shocked and saddened me.&nbsp;</li><li>I read about Kathy Forth, a woman who was heavily involved in the Effective Altruism and Rationalist communities. She committed suicide in 2018, attributing large portions of her suffering to her experiences of sexual harassment and sexual assault in these communities. She accuses several people of harassment, at least one of whom is an incredibly prominent figure in the EA community. It is unclear to me what, if any, actions were taken in response to (some) of her claims and her suicide. What is clear is the pages and pages of tumblr posts and Reddit threats, some from prominent members of the EA and Rationalist communities, disparaging Kathy and denying her accusations.</li></ol><p><br>To be clear, I am&nbsp;<i>not</i> saying that all women have negative experiences in the EA community, nor that all men in EA are perpetrators. People of all genders can perpetrate sexual harassment, sexual assault, and generally offensive behavior. Furthermore, I anticipate responses to some of the instances that I listed above, especially the first two, expressing that they seem pretty minor, or not that big of a deal. And maybe, in your eyes, ranking women based on how attractive they are&nbsp;<i>isn\u2019t&nbsp;</i>a big deal. Maybe you think it\u2019s funny or just doesn\u2019t hold much significance. But, based on my own experience and those of friends and acquaintances, I can assure you that to at least some of those women who are on that list - it is a big deal. Not just because it\u2019s immature or grossly objectifying, but because it is our small, daily actions that inform culture, and behaviors like ranking women or scheduling meetings based on attractiveness may be small, but they contribute to a culture that accepts the objectification of women and the valuing of physical attractiveness above character and contribution.&nbsp;</p><h3><i>Effective Altruism Has an Emotions Problem</i></h3><p>I\u2019m 89% certain that Effective Altruism has an emotions problem and I\u2019m 98% certain that it\u2019s alienating people from the EA community. What do I mean by that?</p><ul><li>On the forum in particular and in EA discourse in general, there is a tendency to give less weight/be more critical of posts that are more emotion-heavy and less rational. This tendency makes sense based on EA principles\u2026 to a certain extent. To stay true to the aforementioned values of scientific mindset and openness, it makes sense that we challenge people\u2019s ideas and are truth-seeking in our comments.&nbsp;<i>However, there is an important distinction between interrogating someone\u2019s research and interrogating someone\u2019s lived experience.</i> I fear that the attitude of truth-seeking and challenging one another to be better has led to an inclination to suspend compassion in the absence of substantial evidence of wrongdoing. You\u2019re allowed to be sorry that someone experienced something without fully understanding it.</li><li>There are certain unofficial norms surrounding posting on the forum that I worry alienate people who are new to the community/people whose tendencies for writing fall outside of the jargon-ridden, bulleted, and rationalist styles that are predominant. While writing this post, I have adopted my own writing style to be more in line with the typical styles on the forum because I believe it will increase my chances of being taken seriously.</li><li>An extreme extension of utilitarian, rationalist, and effective altruist logic can blind us to the negative experiences of individuals and major flaws in the EA community. I fear that people within the EA community are not always taking allegations of harm seriously out of concern that (1) there is \u201cmore impactful\u201d work that they could be doing than investigating such allegations, (2) investigating allegations of harm against prominent individuals may damage the reputation of Effective Altruism, and (3) some individuals are having such a \u201chigh-impact\u201d that they don\u2019t want to find them guilty of an act that may impede such effective work.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>I could tell you how tears streamed down my face as I read through accounts of women who have been harmed by people within the Effective Altruism community. I could describe how my fists curled and my jaw clenched as I scrolled through forum comments and Reddit threats full of disbelief and belittlement. I could try to convey the rising temperature of my blood as it boiled; I could explain to you that I could not focus in class for a full two days. But I don\u2019t think that I will. I\u2019m unsure that the Effective Altruism community has room for my anger.&nbsp;</p><h3><i>What should we do?</i></h3><p>First off, I want to acknowledge that there are some incredible, thoughtful people who are dedicating much of their time to thinking about how to foster a healthy and compassionate community within EA spaces. I recognize that the issues I have raised are complex and without a simple solution, and I appreciate those who have spent time thinking about how to make things better. Here are some ideas\u2026&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Hold yourself and your people accountable. What we do and say informs who we are. If you see someone, especially someone you\u2019re close to, say or do something you disagree with or that you believe contributes to an unwelcoming culture, let them know. This is especially relevant to people you call your friend. In order to do good better, we must aim to make ourselves better too.</li><li>Listen to people when they tell you how they feel. Let people talk about how they feel. Humans are not devoid of emotions and we never will be; emotions are an integral characteristic of human experience, not a flaw in the way we operate.&nbsp;<i>You don\u2019t have to agree with or understand someone to extend compassion!</i></li><li>Recognize that in order to create a healthy, effective, and compassionate community, we need to hold people accountable for their actions regardless of status, connections, or expected-value calculations about their potential for impact. Effective Altruism will not thrive if we unquestionably uphold people who cause harm.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>I\u2019m saddened by the negative experiences people in the Effective Altruism community have had, disappointed in the ways in which some people in the community have responded, and scared that the movement will continue to be a space that does not feel safe nor welcoming for many people. I want to be a part of a community where people aim to do the most good that they can do, innovate ways to do good better, and challenge one another to be better. But, if this same community continues to also create a culture that is ok with demeaning women (or anyone, for that matter), shields individuals from accountability because of their status, and predicates their expansion of compassion on the existence of strong evidence, I want nothing to do with it.&nbsp;</p><p>However, I am hopeful. I think that the EA community has the potential to become a space in which all people feel supported, safe, and welcomed. The ideas for change listed above are cursory and I plan on continuing to think and talk about what we can do to positively impact this community as it grows and evolves. Thank you, truly, for your time and consideration in reading this post. I\u2019m happy to engage with anyone who has thoughts on what I wrote and I hope this inspires both introspection and community change.&nbsp;</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Maya Deutchman"}}, {"_id": "xQBcrPsH57MjCcgTb", "title": "Announcing the Cambridge Boston Alignment Initiative [Hiring!]", "postedAt": "2022-12-02T01:07:43.954Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>TLDR:&nbsp;</strong>The Cambridge Boston Alignment Initiative (<a href=\"http://cbai.ai\"><u>CBAI</u></a>) is a new organization aimed at supporting and accelerating Cambridge and Boston students interested in pursuing careers in AI safety.

It uses interviews from a \"senior EA\", and excepts from an internal Slack channel used by senior EAs.</p><blockquote><p>When my profile of MacAskill, which discussed internal movement discord about Bankman-Fried\u2019s rise to prominence, appeared in August, Wiblin vented his displeasure on the Slack channel. As he put it, the problem was with the format of such a treatment. He wrote, \u201c<strong>They don\u2019t focus on \u2018does this person have true and important ideas.\u2019 The writer has no particular expertise to judge such a thing and readers don\u2019t especially care either. Instead the focus is more often on personal quirkiness and charisma, relationships among people in the story, \u2018she said / he said\u2019 reporting of disagreements, making the reader feel wise and above the substantive issue, and finding ways the topic can be linked to existing political attitudes of New Yorker readers (so traditional liberal concerns). This is pretty bad because our great virtue is being right, not being likeable or uncontroversial or \u2018right-on\u2019 in terms of having fashionable political opinions.</strong>\u201d</p></blockquote><p>There are claims of a warning about SBF on the Slack channel:</p><blockquote><p>This past July, a contributor to the Slack channel wrote to express great apprehension about Sam Bankman-Fried. \u201c<strong>Just FYSA,</strong>\u201d\u2014or for your situational awareness\u2014\u201c<strong>said to me yesterday in DC by somebody in gov\u2019t: \u2018Hey I was investigating someone for [x type of crime] and realized they\u2019re on the board of CEA\u2019&nbsp;</strong>\u201d\u2014MacAskill\u2019s Centre for Effective Altruism\u2014\u201c&nbsp;\u2018<strong>or run EA or something? Crazy! I didn\u2019t realize you could be an EA and also commit a lot of crime. Like shouldn\u2019t those be incompatible?\u2019 (about SBF). I don\u2019t usually share this type of thing here, but seemed worth sharing the sentiment since I think it is not very uncommon and may be surprising to some people.</strong>\u201d In a second message, the contributor continued, \u201c<strong>I think in some circles SBF has a reputation as someone who regularly breaks laws to make money, which is something that many people see as directly antithetical to being altruistic or EA. (and I get why!!). That reputation poses PR concerns to EA whether or not he\u2019s investigated, and whether or not he\u2019s found guilty.</strong>\u201d The contributor felt this was a serious enough issue to elaborate a third time: \u201c<strong>I guess my point in sharing this is to raise awareness that a) in some circles SBF\u2019s reputation is very bad b) in some circles SBF\u2019s reputation is closely tied to EA, and c) there\u2019s some chance SBF\u2019s reputation gets much, much worse. But I don\u2019t have any data on these (particularly c, I have no idea what types of scenarios are likely), though it seems like a major PR vulnerability. I imagine people working full-time on PR are aware of this and actively working to mitigate it, but it seemed worth passing on if not since many people may not be having these types of interactions.</strong>\u201d (Bankman-Fried has not been charged with a crime. The Department of Justice declined to comment.)</p></blockquote><p>The suggestion is that EA leadership, while not knowing of any actual crime, accepted poor behavior and norm breaking because of the resources Bankman-Fried provided.</p><blockquote><p>In other words, it seems as though the only thing that truly counts [...] is the inviolate sphere of ideas\u2014not individual traits, not social relationships, not \u201cshe said\u201d disagreements about whether it was wise to throw in one\u2019s lot with billionaire donors of murky motive, and certainly not \u201ctraditional liberal concerns.\u201d</p><p>...</p><p>Effective altruism did not create Sam Bankman-Fried, but it is precisely this sort of attitude among E.A.\u2019s leadership, a group of people that take great pride in their discriminatory acumen, that allowed them to downweight the available evidence of his ethical irregularities. This was a betrayal of the E.A. rank and file, which is, for the most part, made up of extremely decent human beings.</p><p>What\u2019s worse, however, is what was effectively communicated to Bankman-Fried himself. Ideas in the abstract are influential, but practical social norms constrain what individual actors think they can get away with. The message from E.A. leadership to Bankman-Fried seemed clear: as long as your stated ideals, not to mention your resources, are in alignment with ours, we might not bother ourselves with the other dimensions of your behavior. After all, \u201cour great virtue is being right.\u201d (MacAskill insisted to me that the movement\u2019s leaders have always emphasized acting with integrity.) There was every incentive to look the other way. By the beginning of the summer, Bankman-Fried\u2019s FTX Future Fund, for which MacAskill was serving as an adviser, had promised grants in excess of twenty-eight million dollars to E.A.\u2019s institutional pillars, including C.E.A.; these outfits were the largest recipients of the new foundation\u2019s largesse.

An ML model with a long term goal and an understanding of its training process would probably pretend to be aligned during training, as this would reduce the amount that gradient descent changes its goals and make humans more likely to deploy it, allowing the model to pursue its goal in the long run.&nbsp; This seems likely to occur because the gradient descent path to deceptive alignment is shorter than the path to genuine alignment due to the fact that models must very specific goals in order to become genuinely aligned.&nbsp; Moreover, gradient updates towards deceptive alignment generate large performance increases, further favoring the deceptively aligned path.&nbsp; Deceptively aligned models are also simpler than genuinely aligned models and so are favored by gradient descent's simplicity bias.&nbsp; While deceptively aligned models are slower and use more computational power than genuinely aligned ones, biasing our models to use less compute is unlikely to be a viable alignment strategy as it would not be performance competitive.&nbsp;

But what does this mean?</p><p>Imagine that the Christian God is trying to create a human who does what the Bible says, at least so long as they are on earth.&nbsp; He could do this in three ways:</p><ul><li>He could create Jesus Christ, who, as a copy of God, has literally identical goals to God (which are the same goals that the Bible instructs you to pursue); Jesus is&nbsp;<i>internally aligned</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>He could create Martin Luther, who does not have the exact same goals as God but has the goal of understanding what the Bible says and then doing that.&nbsp; As a result, to the extent that Luther understands the model, he will act aligned with it.&nbsp; Moreover, if he misunderstands the Bible, his misunderstanding can be corrected through further study or through God directly telling him what the Bible really says.&nbsp; Luther is therefore&nbsp;<i>corrigibly aligned</i>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Finally, he could create Blaise Pascal, who acts aligned only because doing so helps him accomplish his own goal of getting into heaven.&nbsp; If Pascal ceases to have an instrumental reason to act aligned with God, he will start pursuing his own goals by other means.&nbsp; Pascal is&nbsp;<i>deceptively aligned</i>.</li></ul><p>While we will not grant the model we train eternal life in heaven if it acts aligned during training, it is still likely to have an instrumental reason to perform well during training even if it is not aligned.&nbsp; This is because if the model performs poorly on the training objective during training, then gradient descent will modify it to make it perform better, including by changing its goal.&nbsp; However, these modifications are likely to make the model worse at pursuing its own goal because it is not aligned with the training objective.</p><p>In contrast, if the model perfectly pursues the training objective during training, gradient descent would change the model and its objective less because such updates would improve its performance by less (or not at all). &nbsp; Additionally, human observers may be fooled into thinking that the model is aligned and then deploying it, at which point it could freely pursue its actual goal.&nbsp; Thus, the model is incentivized to pretend to be aligned during training.</p><p>The problem with deceptively aligned models is that they appear to pursue the training objective during training and so behave indistinguishably from genuinely aligned models.&nbsp; Thus, in order to determine the likelihood that we have trained a deceptively aligned model, we cannot just observe its behavior but must have a prior understanding of the \u201cinductive biases\u201d of gradient descent.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Inductive biases are similar to Bayesian priors in that they determine which particular model, out of all of the models which exhibit a given level of performance, will actually be trained at that level of performance.&nbsp; For example, a training process might have an inductive bias towards simplicity, meaning that given a level of performance, the training process is more likely to train the simpler models which perform at that level.</p><h3><br><strong>High vs Low Path Dependence</strong></h3><p>There are two broad possibilities for how the inductive biases of gradient descent might work:</p><ul><li>If gradient descent has&nbsp;<i>low path dependence</i>, different training runs with different initializations and different orderings of training data end up converging.&nbsp; This would probably occur because gradient descent\u2019s inductive biases favor models with particular properties, so gradient descent produces the model which, at a given level of performance, exhibits those properties to the greatest extent.<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/XKraEJrQRfzbCtzKN/distillation-of-how-likely-is-deceptive-alignment#fngnc048xpyp\"><sup>[1]</sup></a></li><li>If gradient descent has&nbsp;<i>high path dependence</i>, then differences between different training runs result in significantly different final models.&nbsp; Thus, understanding the outcome of gradient descent in the high path dependence case requires us to understand the exact path through model space which the model is likely to take in training rather than merely knowing what properties the final model is likely to have.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Hubinger argues that we might observe either case, and so considers both of them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>2: High Path Dependence<br>&nbsp;</h1><h3><strong>Internal Alignment</strong></h3><p>Beginning with the case of high path dependency, Hubinger asks how likely we are to train an internally aligned model.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The most likely path to internal alignment begins with the model being randomly initialized.&nbsp; Then, early in training, the model acquires a proxy goal which is a decent approximation of the training objective.&nbsp; Finally, this proxy is updated over time by gradient descent until it becomes essentially identical to the training objective.&nbsp; At this point, the model would likely continue to stay internally aligned even if it were trained more, as gradient descent could not improve its performance on the training objective by changing its goal.&nbsp; Throughout this process, the model\u2019s capabilities and understanding of the world also increase.</p><p>However, this path probably requires that the model internalizes the training objective as its own goal before it begins to understand the training process it is being subjected to.&nbsp; This is because once the model has an understanding of its training process and training objective, then if it is not already internally aligned but has a long term goal, it will be incentivized to pretend to pursue the training objective.&nbsp; This is for the previously mentioned reason that if the model directly pursues its actual goal, it will be modified by gradient descent, preventing it from achieving its objective over the long run.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In general, two factors can help us determine how likely different training paths are:</p><ul><li>The first factor is that gradient descent updates the model in the direction that locally increases its performance the most.&nbsp; Thus, as long as a model\u2019s performance would significantly improve if it were updated slightly in the direction of a particular model class, gradient descent will probably update the model in that direction.</li><li>The second factor is how many steps of gradient descent are needed for the model to become a member of a given model class.&nbsp; If many steps are needed, then there are more opportunities for the model to become \u201cderailed\u201d from its training path and veer off towards a different model class.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>These factors do not favor internal alignment.&nbsp; Firstly, because there are diminishing performance returns to making the model\u2019s proxy more aligned with the training objective, the performance gain per step towards internal alignment eventually becomes very low.&nbsp; Because of this fact and because the model must learn a very specific goal to become internally aligned, it will also take many steps to reach internal alignment.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast, while the performance returns to improving the model\u2019s understanding of the world also diminish, the model does not need to have a perfect understanding of the world in order to understand its training process in the same way that its proxy must be perfect in order for it to be aligned.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, while the model would probably eventually learn about its training process as a result of understanding the world in general (particularly if it has access to the huge amount of ML related text online), learning about the fact that it is an ML model in training would also improve its performance at the many tasks like interacting with humans or navigating the physical world which benefit from it having an understanding of its situation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, if we train the model to do such tasks, gradient descent will actively push it towards understanding its training process.</p><p>Finally, Hubinger argues that the returns to improving the model\u2019s understanding of the world diminish more slowly than the returns to improving the model\u2019s proxy.&nbsp; Assuming the training objective is somewhat complicated, it will be difficult for gradient descent to align the proxy perfectly with it.&nbsp; However, there are likely simpler, easier to find objectives that are highly correlated with the training objective, meaning that gradient descent is likely to find these proxies relatively early and then face significant diminishing returns to improving them further.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Conversely, it is difficult to develop a highly incomplete understanding of the world that still mostly enables the model to perform well, so the returns to improvements to the model\u2019s understanding of the world will likely diminish more slowly than those to improving the proxy.</p><p>For these reasons, it seems likely that the model will learn about its training process before it becomes fully internally aligned for the previous reasons and thus veer off towards deceptive alignment.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Corrigible Alignment</strong></h3><p>A model could become corrigibly aligned if it gets to the point where its understanding of the training objective is closer to the actual training objective than its proxy goal is, and then gradient descent changes the model\u2019s goal to a \u201cpointer\u201d to its understanding of the training objective.&nbsp; In other words, gradient descent could modify the model by connecting the circuit representing the training objective to the circuit which encodes the model\u2019s goal such that the model pursues its best understanding of the training objective.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>As in the case of internal alignment, once the model becomes fully corrigibly aligned it would probably stay corrigibly aligned, as gradient descent could not increase its performance by modifying its goal.&nbsp; Thus, corrigible alignment seems more likely than internal alignment, as the model does not need to become aligned before it learns about the training objective in order to become corrigibly aligned.</p><p>However, the path to corrigible alignment suffers from some of the same problems as the path to internal alignment.&nbsp; Pointers, like proxy goals, vary in quality (a pointer could point to something other than the model\u2019s understanding of the training objective but which is still highly correlated with the training objective), and there are diminishing returns to improving pointer alignment for the same reason as in the case of proxy alignment.&nbsp; Thus, to become fully corrigibly aligned, the model will need to go down a training path that eventually has very low performance gains per step.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>While the corrigibly aligned path is probably shorter than the internally aligned path because there are more ways of implementing the necessary pointer than ways of getting the model to perfectly internalize the training objective, it seems likely to still be fairly long.</p><p>Unfortunately, an unaligned pointer which points to the model\u2019s representation of a long term objective could lead the model to become deceptive in the same way as an unaligned long term proxy goal.&nbsp; For example, if the model\u2019s pointer points at the model\u2019s representation of the code for the training objective rather than its representation of the actual training objective in the world, then the model would be incentivized to act aligned in training and then, once deployed, seize control of the computer encoding its training objective and maximize its value.&nbsp; Thus, the corrigible aligned path could easily veer off towards deceptive alignment.</p><h3><br><strong>Deceptive Alignment</strong></h3><p>The most likely path to deceptive alignment begins identically to the corrigibly aligned path until the model learns about the training process.&nbsp; Then, if the model already has a long term goal, it would start to act deceptively; if not, gradient descent could change its goal into a long term objective, causing it to become deceptively aligned.</p><p>This path seems likely for several reasons.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, if the model\u2019s proxy when it begins to understand the training objective is a long term goal, then it will immediately start to become deceptive before the paths to internal or corrigible alignment can even begin.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Even if gradient descent must change the model\u2019s proxy into a long term goal for it to become deceptively aligned, this path has higher performance gains per step than the corrigibly or internally aligned paths.&nbsp; This is because the internally and corrigibly aligned paths require slowly updating the model\u2019s proxy/pointer to become increasingly aligned with the training objective in order to reach maximum performance.&nbsp; In contrast, the deceptively aligned path achieves maximum performance immediately upon making the simple modification of giving the model a long term goal because any deceptively aligned model attempts to do as well on the training objective as possible.&nbsp; Thus, the deceptively aligned model\u2019s performance increases sharply over a relatively short number of gradient updates.&nbsp; For the same reason, the deceptively aligned path is shorter.</p><p>Finally, even if the model does not begin down the deceptively aligned path immediately upon learning about the training process, it could become deceptively aligned even if it started down one of the genuinely aligned paths through the mechanisms discussed in the internal and corrigible alignment sections.</p><p>Altogether, in the high path dependence world, internal alignment seems unlikely, and while corrigible alignment seems somewhat more likely, deceptive alignment seems most likely.</p><h1>3: Low Path Dependence</h1><p>If gradient descent has low path dependence, then it converges across different training runs to the model that, of all the models which perform perfectly in training, exhibits certain high-level properties to the greatest extent.&nbsp; In particular, gradient descent seems to favor models which implement simpler (i. e. lower Kolmogorov complexity) algorithms.&nbsp; It also favors models which implement algorithms which are faster/less computationally expensive. These two inductive biases are not exhaustive, but Hubinger focuses on them because they are well-understood and certainly among the empirically observed inductive biases of gradient descent.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3><strong>Simplicity Bias</strong></h3><p>The simplicity bias favors deceptive alignment.&nbsp; For a variety of reasons (e. g. simpler algorithms often require fewer of the parameters of the neural network which implements them to have specific values), simpler algorithms are generally specified by more possible models.&nbsp; Thus, we can estimate the simplicity of a model class by how many possible models implement it.</p><p>The parameters of an internally aligned model must be specified in great detail so that it has precisely the same goals as the person to whom it is aligned.&nbsp; Thus, few models are internally aligned, so internally aligned models are complex.&nbsp; There are more corrigibly aligned models, as there are many different ways of implementing a pointer to the model\u2019s understanding of the training objective, so corrigibly aligned models are simpler than internally aligned ones.&nbsp; However, deceptively aligned models are the simplest of all, as any of the many possible models with a long term goal can be deceptively aligned.&nbsp; Thus, the simplicity bias favors deceptive alignment.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3><strong>Speed Bias</strong></h3><p>In contrast, the speed bias favors internally and corrigibly aligned models.&nbsp; While internally aligned and corrigibly aligned models pursue the training objective directly, deceptively aligned models have to go through the extra computational step of inferring that they should pursue the training objective rather than their own objective in the short term.&nbsp; In other words, deception adds extra reasoning steps to the thought process of the deceptively aligned models relative to the internally and corrigibly aligned ones, meaning that deceptively aligned models will require more computational steps to run and be slower.</p><p>However, if we try to bias our models towards speed (e. g. train smaller models), we will hamper their performance.&nbsp; Empirically, the smallest models which perfectly fit the training data generalize terribly to the test dataset, as they overfit to the training set while larger models learn simpler and better-generalizing algorithms.&nbsp; As a result, it seems likely that if anything, we will bias our training processes towards simplicity and would struggle to make AGI if we implemented a speed bias.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Deceptive alignment seems to be the likely outcome of training a sufficiently intelligent AI via gradient descent in both the high and low path dependence world.&nbsp; Thus, in order to avoid deceptive alignment, we need to modify the training regime in such a way that it somehow actively avoids deceptively aligned models.&nbsp; The difficulty of this task remains uncertain.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "NickGabs"}}, {"_id": "AmYHgwoquSBbjjkDg", "title": "Informal outreach via personal networks is underrated as a community building strategy", "postedAt": "2022-12-01T20:17:48.304Z", "htmlBody": "<p>The default model for EA community builders, especially college community builders, is to do most community building via formal programs such as intro fellowships targeted at students who the community builders have little or no particular connection to. &nbsp;However, I claim that per unit time, EA outreach to your family/friends/associates (which I will refer to as your \"social network\") is much more effective. &nbsp;This is for four reasons:</p><ol><li>Even very smart/rational people are persuaded of things significantly on the basis of how much they like the person who is attempting to persuade them/how much they trust them. &nbsp;As a community builder at a large college, random students who join a reading group have no particular reason to trust or like you. &nbsp;However, presumably your friends/family/associates like and trust you a decent amount, making it easier for you to persuade them of things in general (and potentially to apply mild social pressure to them to take actions on the basis of the things you persuade them of). &nbsp;Moreover, if you are known by your social network to be a more thoughtful/smart/good person than average (as I suspect that the average EA is), you will be even more able to influence them relative to a person who does not know you.</li><li>People in the social networks of EAs are likely to themselves have significantly stronger proto-EA attitudes than randomly selected college students, as people tend to befriend people who are like themselves, and people tend to be similar to their families for genetic reasons. &nbsp;Given that whether a person has strong proto-EA attitudes appears to me to be the main determinant of whether or not you can successfully convince them to get involved in EA, this makes people in the social networks of EA community builders much more promising targets for outreach than people from many other groups.</li><li>You have much more information about the people in your social networks than you do about random college students. &nbsp;This allows you to select members of your social network to pitch EA to who are particularly persuadable and promising, and also enables you to tailor your pitch more specifically to them than you are able to for a random college student.</li><li>In my experience, long-ish one-on-one conversations are remarkably effective as a community building tactic. &nbsp;Generally, random college students will not be willing to have an extended one on one conversation about EA with you. &nbsp;However, you can almost certainly have an extended one on one conversation about EA with someone in your social network.</li></ol><p>Personally, as a community builder at Harvard EA, I believe I have had much more impact through my informal discussions with my friends and family members than I have through running formal programs and reading groups. &nbsp;While I think I select my friends for proto-EA characteristics more than the median EA, my guess is that it would still be more effective at current margins for most EA community builders in college to spend a unit of time on this kind of informal outreach as opposed to a unit of time on formal community building.</p>", "user": {"username": "NickGabs"}}, {"_id": "wypC4nDxsxYcsRvdC", "title": "Beware frictions from altruistic value differences", "postedAt": "2022-12-01T18:58:48.081Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I believe value differences pose some underappreciated challenges in large-scale altruistic efforts.

Such values-related frictions may in turn lead to the following pitfalls and failure modes:</p><ul><li>Failing to achieve moral aims that are already widely shared, such as avoiding worst-case outcomes (cf. \u201c<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BXRNGrBNxemi3qGMp/common-ground-for-longtermists\">Common ground for longtermists</a>\u201d).</li><li>Failing to make mutually beneficial <a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/moral-trade-1.pdf\">moral trades</a> and <a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/gains-from-trade-through-compromise/\">compromises</a> when possible (in ways that do not introduce problematic behavior such as dishonesty or censorship).</li><li>Failing to update on arguments, whether they be empirical or values-related, because the arguments are made by those who, to our minds, seem like they belong to the \u201cother side\u201d.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefb8bz9qx9mtf\"><sup><a href=\"#fnb8bz9qx9mtf\">[2]</a></sup></span></li><li>Some people committing harmful acts out of spite or primitive tribal instincts.

Yet poorly handled such frictions are probably still a key risk factor for these failure modes.</p><h2><strong>Reasons to expect values-related frictions to be significant</strong></h2><p>The following are some reasons to expect values-related frictions to be both common and quite difficult to handle by default.</p><h3><strong>Harmful actions based on different moral beliefs may be judged more harshly than intentional harm</strong></h3><p>One set of findings that seem relevant come from a 2016 anthropological study that examined the moral judgments of people across ten different cultures, eight of which were traditional small-scale societies (Barrett et al., <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1522070113\">2016</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>The study specifically asked people how they would evaluate a harmful act in light of a range of potentially extenuating circumstances, such as different moral beliefs, a mistake of fact, or self-defense. While there was significant variation in people\u2019s moral judgments across cultures, there was nevertheless unanimous agreement that committing a harmful act based on different moral beliefs was <i>not</i> an extenuating circumstance. Indeed, on average across cultures, committing a harmful act based on different moral beliefs was considered worse than was committing the harmful act intentionally (see Barrett et al., <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1522070113\">2016</a>, fig. 5). [Edit: The particular moral belief used in the study was that \u201cstriking a weak person to toughen him up is praiseworthy\u201d.]</p><p>It is unclear whether this pattern in moral judgment necessarily applies to all or even most kinds of acts inspired by different moral beliefs. Yet these results still tentatively suggest that we may be inclined to see value differences as a uniquely aggravating factor in our moral judgments of people\u2019s actions \u2014 as something that tends to inspire harsher judgments rather than understanding. (See also Delton et al., <a href=\"https://pdescioli.com/papers/delton.descioli.ryan.pol.negotiations.polpsych.20.pdf\">2020</a>.)</p><h3><strong>Hot cognition about values-related beliefs, alliances, and opponents</strong></h3><p>Another relevant finding is that our minds appear to reflexively process moral and political groups and issues in ways that are strongly emotionally charged \u2014 an instance of \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_and_cold_cognition\">hot cognition</a>\u201d. Specifically, we appear to affectively process our own groups and beliefs in a favorable light while similarly processing the \u201coutgroup\u201d and their beliefs in an unfavorable light. And what is striking about this affectively charged processing is that it appears to be swift and automatic, occurring prior to conscious thought, which suggests that we are mostly unaware that it happens (Lodge &amp; Taber, <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3792606\">2005</a>; see also Kunda, <a href=\"https://fbaum.unc.edu/teaching/articles/Psych-Bulletin-1990-Kunda.pdf\">1990</a>; Haidt, <a href=\"https://www.its.caltech.edu/~squartz/haidt.pdf\">2001</a>).</p><p>These findings give us reason to expect that our reflexive processing of those who hold different altruistic values will tend to be affectively charged in ways that we are not aware of, and in ways that are not so easily changed (cf. Lodge &amp; Taber, <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3792606\">2005</a>, p. 476).</p><h3><strong>Coalitional instincts</strong></h3><p>A related reason to expect values-driven tensions to be significant and difficult to avoid is that the human mind plausibly has strong <a href=\"https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27168\">coalitional instincts</a>, i.e. instincts for carving the world into, and smoothly navigating among, competing coalitions (Tooby &amp; Cosmides, <a href=\"https://www.cep.ucsb.edu/papers/GroupsInMind2010.pdf\">2010</a>; Pinsof et al, <a href=\"https://psyarxiv.com/scmhe/\">2023</a>).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvl2u04ej03h\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvl2u04ej03h\">[4]</a></sup></span></p><p>As John Tooby <a href=\"https://www.edge.org/response-detail/27168\">notes</a>, these instincts may dispose us to blindly flatter and protect our own groups while misrepresenting and attacking other groups and coalitions. He likewise suggests that our coalitional instincts may push our public discourse less toward substance and more toward displaying loyalty to our own groups (see also Hannon, <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/archive/HANDOB.pdf\">2021</a>).</p><p>In general, it seems that \u201cteam victory\u201d is a strong yet often <a href=\"https://magnusvinding.com/2022/05/06/team-victory-as-a-key-hidden-motive/\">hidden motive</a> in human behavior. And these coalitional instincts and \u201cteam victory\u201d motives arguably further highlight the psychological challenges posed by value differences, not least since value differences often serve as the defining features of contrasting coalitions.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefe1h7yxi8btr\"><sup><a href=\"#fne1h7yxi8btr\">[5]</a></sup></span></p><h2><strong>Concrete suggestions for mitigating the risks of values-related frictions</strong></h2><p>Below are a few suggestions for how one might address the challenges and risks associated with values-related frictions.

After all, contrary to what our intuitions might suggest, it is quite conceivable that some of our greatest counterfactual gains can be found in the realm of cooperation with agents who hold different values from ourselves \u2014 e.g. by steering clear of \u201cfights\u201d and by instead collaborating to expand our Pareto frontier (cf. Hanson on \u201c<a href=\"https://www.overcomingbias.com/2019/05/expand-vs-fight-social-justice-fertility-bioconservatism-and-ai-risk.html\">Expand vs Fight</a>\u201d). It would be tragic to lose out on such gains due to unwittingly navigating more by our coalitional instincts and identities than by impartial impact.</p><h3><strong>Making an effort to become aware of, and to actively reduce, the tendency to engage in reflexive ingroup liking and promotion</strong></h3><p>It is to be expected that we are prone to ingroup liking and ingroup promotion to a somewhat excessive degree (relative to what our impartial values would recommend).

These are all low-confidence\u2014I'd like to validate them against a broader set of orgs\u2014but I thought I'd write them up to see if they resonate with people.</p><h2>Observations</h2><h3>Many orgs skew extremely junior</h3><p>The EA community skews very young, and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/YLudF7wvkjALvAgni/p/4xczoALF6adpQk3TN#Age\">highly engaged EAs (like those working at orgs) skew even younger</a>. Anecdotally, I was the same age or older than almost everyone I talked to, many of whom were the most experienced person in their org. By comparison, at Wave almost the entire prod/eng leadership team is my age or older. (Note that this seems to be less true in the most established/large/high-status orgs, e.g. Open Phil.)</p><p>This isn't a disaster, especially since the best of the junior people are very talented, but it does lead to a set of typical problems:</p><ul><li>having to think through how to do everything from first principles rather than copy what's worked from elsewhere</li><li>managers needing to spend a fair amount of time providing basic \"how to be a functioning employee\" support to junior hires</li><li>managers <i>not</i> providing that support and the junior hires ending up being less effective, or growing less quickly, than they would at an org that could provide them more support</li></ul><p>(At Wave, we've largely avoided hiring people with &lt;2 years of work experience onto the prod/eng team for this reason. Of course, that's easier for us than for many EA orgs, so I'm not suggesting this as a general solution.)</p><p>It also leads to two specific subproblems:</p><h3>Many managers are first-time managers</h3><p>Again, this isn't a disaster, since many of these first-time managers are very smart, hardworking and kind. But, first-time managers have a few patterns of mistakes they tend to make, mostly related to \"seeing around corners\" or making decisions whose consequences play out on a long time horizon (understandably, since they often haven't worked as a manager for long enough to have seen long-time-horizon decisions play out!). This is things like:</p><ul><li>Providing enough coaching and career growth for their team</li><li>Giving feedback that's difficult to give</li><li>Making sure their reports are happy in their roles and not burning out</li></ul><p>The last point seems especially underrated in EA, I suspect because people are unusually focused on \"doing what's optimal, not what's fun.\" That's a good idea to a large extent, but even for many people who are largely motivated by impact, they can be <a href=\"https://www.benkuhn.net/10x/\">massively more or less productive</a> depending on how much their day-to-day work resonates with them. But I suspect many EAs, like me, are reluctant to admit that this applies to us too and we're not purely impact-maximizing robots.</p><h3>Almost all managers-of-managers are first-timers</h3><p>Going from managing individual contributors to managing managers is a fairly different skillset in many ways. Most people in EA orgs that are managing managers seem to be \"career EAs\" for whom it's their first manager-of-managers role. As above, new managers of managers tend to make some predictable mistakes, e.g.:</p><ul><li>Not planning far enough ahead for what hires they'll need to make to support their org's growth</li><li>Hiring/promoting the wrong people into management roles (having become a good manager doesn't necessarily mean you'll be good at coaching/evaluating other managers who fail in different ways than you did!)</li><li>Not noticing team dysfunction, either due to not having systems in place (e.g. skip-level 1:1s) or not knowing that something is a red flag</li></ul><h3>Many leaders are isolated</h3><p>Compared to the for-profit world, EA seems to have a much smaller proportion of people working at large organizations, and a larger proportion working at small/mid-sized orgs. This means that many managers / managers-of-managers are the only person in their org with that job, and don't have other peers they can rely on for support, sanity checking or talking through a difficult decision.</p><h3>Many leaders are reluctant managers</h3><p>This is a problem in the for-profit world as well\u2014the classic example is promoting your best engineer into management despite the fact that they have no people skills. In EA, it's often more like promoting your best philosopher, but the results are similar.</p><p>This sometimes works well, if the person being promoted is motivated to work hard at becoming a great manager / organization-builder, but if they're not, it often ends up with them burning out, and their team having culture or execution problems.</p><h3>We don't know how to structure teams</h3><p>In engineering management, the area I'm most familiar with, there's a set of fairly well-known ways to structure organizations and teams to mitigate the \"reluctant manager\" problem\u2014for example, splitting up engineering leadership between one person who focuses people management and one who focuses on technical decision-making and strategy.</p><p>Unfortunately, most EA teams aren't doing very much software engineering; instead they're doing activities like research or grantmaking where there are fewer large orgs whose example we can learn from. As a result, we have less of a well-developed idea of what these teams should look like, and often end up putting all the leadership responsibility on one person, who either drops the ball on part of it or ends up stretched very thin.</p><h2>Some ideas for improvement</h2><ul><li>I'm thinking about creating an \"EA managers\" slack similar to the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/KMo7pGbssHKJLqmSk/ea-operations-slack-1\">Operations</a> one, where people can get advice/support from managers in other orgs. Let me know if you're interested in this!</li><li>I think the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jpc5FLcTwHyFzWNFy/want-advice-on-management-organization-building\">advising I've done so far</a> has been pretty helpful to people. I'm happy to do more of this, and I also suspect that non-EA management/leadership coaches would be valuable for people as well; I don't feel like the fact that I'm familiar with the EA community comes up that much.</li><li>I suspect more orgs/teams could use a \"COO\"-type figure who offloads people-management responsibilities from the person who's responsible for vision/strategy/fundraising/etc. This is a difficult role to hire for, but with the right pairing, it can make the team dramatically more effective.</li></ul><p>I'm curious whether leaders at other EA orgs resonate with these observations, have other patterns to add that they've noticed, or have ideas about potential mitigations!</p>", "user": {"username": "Ben_Kuhn"}}, {"_id": "DXEvFg7uPCHax34hA", "title": "What \"Think Global, Act Local\" Means for US Climate Philanthropists", "postedAt": "2022-12-02T14:32:18.892Z", "htmlBody": "<p>By Johannes Ackva</p><p>These posts were originally written for the Founders Pledge Blog so the style is a bit different (e.g. less technical, less hedging language) than for typical EA Forum posts.

Framed in EA terms, a key question is how a much improved and enlarged policy effort affects marginal returns to advocacy, in particular how reasons to expect declining marginal returns (less neglectedness, overall a better effort with less room for improvement) and reasons to expect increased marginal returns (a much larger effort overall that can be affected and a reduced risk of failure of innovations failing in \u201cvalleys of death\u201d) trade-off against each other.<br><br>While this will be the subject of future posts in this series, the present post focuses on setting the scene, recapitulating what happened, and establishing a perspective for how to evaluate different components of the recent wins and philanthropic attempts to improve their implementation \u2013 in particular arguing that there is very likely a negative correlation between what will reduce emissions in the US in the short-term (scaling mature technologies) and what is most significant about those bills in general (accelerating less mature technologies) \u2013 something that should affect our philanthropic foci.</p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>With the passage of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act (together thoroughly reshaping and upgrading the US energy innovation system), as well as the midterm elections behind us, it is worth asking how the US climate action and philanthropy space has changed.</p><p>And, critically, how should <i>our</i> climate giving and grantmaking change in light of these developments?</p><p>We explore this question, drawing on our prior work on <a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/stories/the-implications-of-bidens-victory-for-impact-focused-climate-philanthropy\">innovation advocacy and the impact of political developments</a>, and try to incorporate a variety of developments to form a view on how innovation advocacy now compares to other opportunities, such as engaging with innovation work outside the US and/or via other theories of change.</p><p>To start, though, we will ask a much more narrow question: <strong>what happened and how can we make sense of it from a global perspective?</strong></p><h1>I. Background: 2021-22 - A period of massive climate wins</h1><p>As we hopefully predicted in our 2020 <a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/stories/the-implications-of-bidens-victory-for-impact-focused-climate-philanthropy\">report on the implications of Biden\u2019s win</a> for climate philanthropy, the last two years have seen dramatic progress in US climate policy with three major pieces of legislation having passed:</p><ul><li><strong>Bipartisan Infrastructure and Investment and Job Act (IIJA) (2021)</strong>: a bipartisan bill including investments in clean energy infrastructure as well as a large expansion of the US energy innovation effort, with \u2013 particularly noteworthy \u2013 increased attention on demonstration projects, a priorly missing link in the US innovation system. Most of the emissions effects here are over the long-term, with a meager 1% difference in emissions by 2035 compared to business as usual (according to REPEAT project\u2019s <a href=\"https://repeatproject.org/docs/REPEAT_IRA_Prelminary_Report_2022-08-04.pdf\">modeling</a>), but there are many innovation bets that could have large effects globally.

The global significance of US climate wins</h1><p>While a lot of the discussion, in particular around the IRA, has focused on how much closer these developments will put the US towards its 2030 target, <strong>the real significance of the IRA and the other bills lies in their global effect over this century</strong> \u2013 with <i>total cumulative</i> US emissions reductions until 2032 (over 10 years for a total of <a href=\"https://repeatproject.org/docs/REPEAT_IRA_Prelminary_Report_2022-08-04.pdf\">6.3</a> gigatons (GT)) in the order of 12% of current <i>annual</i> global emissions (around 50 GT). Put differently, this means that, despite its tremendous significance for US climate policy, the IRA and other climate policies will shave off just more than 1% of global emissions <i>directly</i> over this decade per year.</p><p>Luckily, there are at least two powerful mechanisms for these pieces of legislation to have much wider global effects \u2013 policy leadership and innovation.</p><p>Before we dive in, a brief note on methodology. Throughout the course of the following exploration, we will often use rough \u201cback-of-the-envelope\u201d estimates that are certainly wrong and imprecise. The reason for this lies in the nature of what we are talking about, namely, indirect uncertain effects through space and time. While it might seem objectionable to put rough numbers \u2013 guesstimates \u2013 on these effects, we think it is important to do so because the alternative, just mentioning those effects as an afterthought or a qualitative consideration, effectively sets those effects to zero even though they might be the most important ones. Treating effects as zero just because they are uncertain or evolve over time is likely more misleading than approximating effects with rough estimates (see also <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LdZcit8zX89rofZf3/evidence-cluelessness-and-the-long-term-hilary-greaves#Response_four__Ignore_things_that_we_can_t_even_estimate\">here</a> for a related argument as to why we should not just ignore uncertain effects).</p><h3>Policy leadership</h3><p>While the recent COP27 conference has been a disappointment in not achieving commitments for more ambitious global emissions cuts, it appears likely that the strengthened US climate policy effort will help achieve more ambitious targets in the future, compared to a counterfactual scenario without passage of the IRA. It also seems likely that, had the US not passed the IRA, the risk of backsliding on global targets would have been even larger.</p><p>Unfortunately, it is very difficult to say anything specific about these effects, but the basic emissions math \u2013 any one country being small in terms of global future emissions \u2013 and the expected leadership role of the US, suggests that the effect is large. <strong>Even if the existence of a strong US climate policy framework (the IRA) only reduced global emissions outside the US by 1% through its effect on inspiring action and avoiding backsliding, this effect alone would almost double the IRA\u2019s effectiveness (increase it by 70%)</strong>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefahhnrzriuq8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnahhnrzriuq8\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><h3>Innovation</h3><p>As we have seen in the discussion above, two of the three most significant climate bills of the Biden agenda \u2013 the IIJA and CHIPS \u2013 are explicitly focused on innovation, seeking to achieve progress on climate through changing the technological trajectory.</p><p><strong>But even for the least innovation-focused of these bills, the IRA, the main effect on global emissions will likely be induced technological change over time, rather than short-term reductions in US emissions.</strong></p><p>Green hydrogen example</p><p>To understand this, consider the example of clean/green<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzsw9lxr7kv\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzsw9lxr7kv\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;hydrogen -- a key lever to decarbonize sectors where direct electrification is challenging.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://www.icf.com/insights/energy/clean-energy-economic-benefits-US-climate-law\">ICF\u2019s modeling of the IRA</a>, clean hydrogen achieves the largest cost-reduction across all modeled technologies, suggesting a 60% reduction in cost, compared to the counterfactual of no IRA. <a href=\"https://rhg.com/research/climate-clean-energy-inflation-reduction-act/\">Rhodium Group\u2019s analysis</a> independently models cost-reductions for green hydrogen at 60-90% cost-reduction through the IRA by 2030. Crucially, Rhodium Group\u2019s analysis also suggests that this would lead green hydrogen towards being cheaper than high-carbon alternatives by 2030 in the optimistic case (low-cost assumptions) and close to cost-competitiveness in the pessimistic case (a high-cost scenario):</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669991539/mirroredImages/DXEvFg7uPCHax34hA/dp8qvdmmwp6curcfmhc2.jpg\" alt=\"Impact of IRA on green hydrogen\"></p><p>A conservative back-of-the-envelope calculation -- assuming that this acceleration of trajectory in green hydrogen, with cost reductions of 60-90% by 2030 (!), would <i>only</i> lead to a three-year acceleration of achieving a 5% abatement of global emissions through green hydrogen -- would suggest an emissions reduction of 4.5 GT from the green hydrogen component of the IRA alone. <strong>So, even under these conservative assumptions, the innovation effect of trajectory change in a </strong><i><strong>single technological pillar</strong></i><strong> would be close to the total estimated emissions effect of the IRA in the US over the next decade (6.3 GT)</strong>.</p><p>Meanwhile, of the estimated 6.3 GT in total emissions reductions in the US over the next decade (by 2032, i.e. two years beyond the 2030 target, according to <a href=\"https://repeatproject.org/docs/REPEAT_IRA_Prelminary_Report_2022-08-04.pdf\">REPEAT Project 2022</a>, p. 6), about \u2154 will be in the power and transport sector, primarily through the deployment of renewables and electric cars -- technologies where the innovation effects of additional deployment will be considerably lower than for less mature technologies.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefubgpjv3ard8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnubgpjv3ard8\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669991539/mirroredImages/DXEvFg7uPCHax34hA/zikzxys2pggr7kvosf1i.png\" alt=\"REPEAT\"></p><p>For example, even though the IRA is expected to lead to a massive increase in solar capacity additions -- a 5x increase in solar capacity additions by 2025 compared to 2020 (<a href=\"https://repeatproject.org/docs/REPEAT_IRA_Prelminary_Report_2022-08-04.pdf\">REPEAT Project 2022</a>, p. 11) -- additional <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levelized_cost_of_electricity\">levelized cost reductions</a> in solar through the IRA are only estimated to be in the 30% range compared to a 60% reduction for green hydrogen (<a href=\"https://www.icf.com/insights/energy/clean-energy-economic-benefits-US-climate-law\">ICF</a>).&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref590kbax6u9\"><sup><a href=\"#fn590kbax6u9\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, these cost reductions are less relevant than for other technologies given both that solar is already competitive on the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) in many locations and that the key constraint is not levelized cost, but rather availability, siting, transport and storage infrastructure.</p><h1>III. What this means for climate activists and philanthropists</h1><p>We are thus in a situation where the following is likely to be true:</p><h3>Thinking long-term and globally changes what is most important</h3><ul><li><strong>(1) US short-term reductions are dominated by mature technologies</strong>: The most significant short-term emissions reductions from the Biden policy window in the US which we can predict will be through the increased deployment of mature technologies, such as solar, wind and electric cars;</li><li><strong>(2) However, the main effects of Biden climate policies will be on other technologies that have not yet reached maturity</strong>: Even under quite conservative assumptions, the main effect of Biden\u2019s climate policies on emissions reductions will \u201ctravel through\u201d cost reductions and other improvements of currently immature technologies. This seems already true for the IRA and will be even truer once we take into account the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 and the IIJA, which do not even (seriously) aim to reduce emissions in the US in the short-term, but rather focus on improving the US energy innovation pipeline, i.e. prioritizing long-term global effects;</li><li><strong>(3) There is, thus, a negative correlation between short-term emissions reductions in the US by 2030 and the global significance of components of the IRA, IIJA and CHIPS Act</strong>: By and large, the policy components driving most of the emissions reductions in the US until 2030 are those where innovation effects are relatively lower, whereas the more globally relevant changes will reduce less emissions in the US by 2030. If a technology can reduce significant emissions in the US by 2030, then it is probably already (close to) mature. This, however, means that the technological learning per additional capacity is limited, as the steepest cost reductions usually appear in early deployment.</li></ul><h3>A visualization</h3><p>To see this more clearly, consider the following visualization which tries to make reasonable estimates (data and some reasoning <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xPmpqWp3LwAb_YfUiOUNmtAYXMfiUdWIvJQO728YCTI/edit?usp=sharing\">here</a>) on the relative value of different parts of the legislations on US emissions until 2032 (using published estimates where available) and on the long-run global consequences. Note that this is about additional emissions savings through the legislation, not the total potential of those technologies, and that the estimates about innovation effects are intentionally conservative to bias against the argument we are making.</p><p>While those estimates are, of course, highly uncertain, and we hope to refine and expand on them in the future, here they are really just meant to more clearly make an important point that should be uncontroversial, but is \u2013 we believe \u2013 underappreciated: given that US emissions until 2032 are a small part of future emissions, but that the US is a major energy innovator \u2013 and much more so with the recent policy wins \u2013 we should appreciate the significant leverage that comes from helping make sure as many of those innovation bets as possible are successfully realized.</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669991539/mirroredImages/DXEvFg7uPCHax34hA/krhcz2o8zfxalrztppmd.jpg\" alt=\"Visualisation graph\"></p><p>[As discussed, the back-of-the-envelope calculations here are very rough and we are keen to do more BOTECs on this in the future, also curious for ideas in the comments.</p><p>However, the basic point, that indirect innovation and technological learning effects will dominate the domestic impacts of US climate policy, and that this will be more so for less mature technologies, seems very robustly true to us from a variety of angles discussed throughout the post, e.g. the BOTECs, modeling on cost reductions, and the generalized lesson that earlier technology support reaps larger benefits while being comparatively more additional by default.]</p><h3><br><br>What to look for when evaluating success</h3><p>If 1 to 3 above are true, this has a couple of surprising implications for how to evaluate the implementation of Biden\u2019s climate bills:</p><ul><li><strong>(4) Modeled or observed emissions reductions patterns in the US by 2030 are not a good proxy for the significance of policy components</strong>: This is the case since those patterns will primarily be driven by already mature technologies that represent a minority of the global impact of the Biden climate bills;</li><li><strong>(5) Other signals are at least similarly important to look out for when evaluating the success of policies going into implementation</strong>: E.g. <i>\u201cWhat are the cost trends we can observe for technologies not quite mature enough to drive significant emissions reductions, such as green hydrogen or carbon capture and storage?\u201d</i>, or: <i>\u201cIs the strengthened framework for energy innovation established by the Energy Act of 2020, IIJA, and CHIPS and Science Act funded sufficiently and does it operate well?\u201d</i>, <i>\u201cIs the new Office on Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) succeeding?\u201d</i>, Or: <i>\u201cAre the bets around advanced nuclear and geothermal paying off?\u201d</i></li></ul><p>While it is unlikely that these ways of tracking progress will be entirely disjointed \u2013 after all, both stronger local action and stronger innovation policy become more likely with stronger overall support for climate policy \u2013 they are far from perfectly correlated. At the very least, this makes it important to look at \u201cother signals\u201d carefully in addition to emissions reductions.</p><h3>Implications for action</h3><p>However, the most important implication for action comes from comparing estimated importance to estimated existing attention and tractability.</p><p>Firstly, because activism, existing clean energy interests, and the overall mainstream climate discourse are heavily focused on short-term local or national targets as well as deploying mature technologies, impact-oriented philanthropists seeking to improve the trajectory of less mature technologies have the benefit of acting in a less crowded space where additional funding can make a larger difference.</p><p>Importantly, because policy support at early stages is often less politicized as it requires fewer jurisdiction-level regulations and controversial siting decisions, there is also an argument that one should expect improving earlier-stage support to be more tractable philanthropically, e.g. by funding the research and engagement of new offices, such as the OCED, maximizing the positive effect of the improved institutional and funding environment.</p><p>Thus, for impact-oriented philanthropists, at least tentatively, <strong>three independent factors speak in favor of primarily focusing on strategies improving the parts of the IIJA, IRA and CHIPS implementation that affect less mature technologies</strong>: (i) larger actual relevance (higher importance) as well as (ii) lower crowdedness (higher additionality) and (iii) lower politicization (suggesting higher tractability). They thus do well on metrics usually considered important in philanthropic effectiveness.</p><p><strong>One should not take this view to the extreme and be entirely </strong><i><strong>\u201csurgical\u201d</strong></i> \u2013\u2013 all climate policies profit from a policy and regulatory environment where it is easier to build things, and where the overall support for climate policy is higher. And, indeed, this is very much a marginal argument given what everyone else is doing (i.e. not everyone should change tack!).</p><p>But in a situation where the implementation of the IIJA, CHIPS, and IRA, as well as the push for new additional climate policies, will lead to a continually crowded advocacy space, it is worth remembering that some projects, policies, and budgetary choices are much more important than others <strong>and, crucially, that our discourse\u2019s focus on short-term local emissions reductions will often lead us astray as to what those important actions are</strong>. When trying to have the most positive impact on shaping the climate trajectory, a clear-eyed view of the global ramifications of different local actions is crucial, and something we will continue to work on and talk about in more detail going forward.</p><h2>About Founders Pledge</h2><p>Founders Pledge is a community of over 1,700 tech entrepreneurs finding and funding solutions to the world\u2019s most pressing problems.

This is the final post in a series of three Giving Tuesday blog posts with updates to our thinking on high-impact climate change philanthropy, you can find the original posts on our <a href=\"http://founderspledge.com\">website</a>.</p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>If you live in Europe or the US, you\u2019ve probably seen your energy and fuel bills rise this year due to the war in Ukraine, which has disrupted oil and gas markets. In addition to its wider geopolitical implications, the war has shifted many nations\u2019 energy policy priorities: Europe is doubling down on decarbonization; while India and China are rushing to buy Russian fossil fuels at a discount. This means that the war is likely to affect global carbon emissions and, thus, the climate. <strong>But how exactly will the disruptions to energy markets affect emissions? Does the war increase or decrease risks from climate change?</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The answer is: it\u2019s complicated, but the uncertainty in the political landscape probably increases climate risk overall. This has implications for policy-makers and philanthropists who are worried about climate change: <strong>in a more uncertain world, we should prioritize robust climate interventions as well as those that hedge against worst-case scenarios</strong>.</p><h1>A reason for optimism: faster decarbonization</h1><p>Due to sanctions and other disruptions, oil and gas have become less available, and therefore more expensive, across Europe. This has led to Europe doubling down on earlier plans to decarbonize, both because higher fossil fuel prices make low-carbon alternatives more competitive, and because the war has highlighted the advantages of energy independence. In May, the European Commission produced the <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/info/strategy/priorities-2019-2024/european-green-deal/repowereu-affordable-secure-and-sustainable-energy-europe_en\">REPowerEU</a> plan for \u201csaving energy, producing clean energy, diversifying our energy supply\u201d and ending Europe\u2019s dependence on Russian oil and gas by 2030. So, <strong>the war may end up accelerating the transition to green energy</strong>, both in Europe and further afield. This would mean fewer emissions and less climate damage. Michael Liebreich from Bloomberg New Energy Finance <a href=\"https://about.bnef.com/blog/after-ukraine-the-great-clean-energy-acceleration/\">makes this case</a>, arguing that the Ukraine crisis will lead to a situation where the three main drivers of energy policy \u2013 sustainability (including climate), energy security and affordability \u2013 all point in the direction of clean energy acceleration and faster decarbonization. However, this is far from the only case one can make.</p><h1>Reasons for pessimism: carbon lock-in and international tension</h1><p>On the other hand, other changes in fossil fuel markets seem likely to increase emissions, as countries <a href=\"https://climateactiontracker.org/documents/1055/CAT_2022-06-08_Briefing_EnergyCrisisReaction.pdf\">across the world</a> scramble to subsidize carbon-intensive energy to shield consumers. <strong>Russia is selling its excess oil to India and China at a discount</strong>, which might lead to those countries using more and building more infrastructure around fossil fuels (though overall, the picture in Asia is <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-business-asia-india-global-trade-fe2e7b9ddd1411f5b748a77c8186bcbd\">complicated</a>). Meanwhile, to address the crisis, Germany is building new terminals to import liquefied natural gas from the US. Investments like this are expensive and won\u2019t pay off for decades, which means that there\u2019s a <strong>risk of carbon lock-in</strong>: it will now be more difficult for nations with new fossil fuel infrastructure to cut their losses and decarbonize sooner.</p><p>The war has also caused a breakdown in international cooperation. If tensions persist or escalate further, this could be bad for the climate, among everything else, since <strong>many interventions to reduce warming need lots of international cooperation</strong>.</p><p>For example, one promising way to reduce global warming is to prevent tropical deforestation, since rainforests remove carbon from the atmosphere. However, this requires international cooperation: richer countries subsidize countries with rainforests so they have less need to cut them down. Even now, this works at best imperfectly; it\u2019s far less likely to work in a world where the global great powers are hostile to each other. The more conflict there is, the fewer effective tools we have for fighting climate change.</p><p>For example, the COP27 conference in November 2022 failed to set ambitious mitigation targets, partly because of the changed geopolitical environment (though the climate priorities of the host, Egypt, also had an influence).</p><h1>Confused? Even symmetric uncertainty increases climate risk</h1><p>Quicker decarbonization in Europe might reduce emissions; carbon lock-in and conflict may increase them; but what does this mean overall? Will one of these effects dominate, or will they balance out? We probably won\u2019t know until it is too late, since the greatest impacts are long term and uncertain. For example, we don\u2019t know:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Will Europe <i>in fact</i> shift to low-carbon energy more quickly? And if so, will this lead to quicker decarbonization elsewhere in the 2030s by making low-carbon energy cheaper?</p><p><a href=\"https://climateactiontracker.org/press/analysis-response-to-russia-ukraine-crisis-could-lock-in-warming/\">How much lock-in</a> will the new liquefied natural gas infrastructure cause?</p><p>How severely will the war affect global cooperation, and will this effect be temporary or long term? As Michael Liebreich <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWcjwdbapEk\">notes</a> in a less optimistic moment, it\u2019s now more likely that Taiwan will be invaded, which could set clean energy back for years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We are thus in a difficult situation: we need to make decisions even though we do not know how many of these large, irreducible uncertainties will resolve. Despite the uncertainty, however, we can predict that <strong>the Ukraine war has likely increased climate risk overall</strong>. This is true even if we\u2019re not sure whether the positive or negative considerations will dominate; <strong>more uncertainty about climate outcomes tends to increase risk even if the uncertainty cuts both ways</strong>.</p><p>The idea of <strong>expected climate damage</strong> helps us understand this. We currently know that the planet is heating up, but we don\u2019t know how much warmer it will get. Many different scenarios are possible, and each scenario is predicted to cause different amounts of damage. We can calculate expected climate damage (represented by the orange bar chart below) by multiplying the probability that each degree of warming will happen (yellow) by the amount of damage caused by that degree of warming (red).</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669991620/mirroredImages/TfbwBmvmeNGG5D4wY/nyrcrcr5pqmunl8blpau.jpg\" alt=\"Structure of Climate Risk\"></p><p>As you might expect, more global warming is likely to cause more damage. Less intuitively, the amount of damage increases nonlinearly with warming. We might think that since 6 degrees of warming is twice as much as 3 degrees, 6 degrees will cause twice as much damage. In fact, on plausible estimates, it\u2019s predicted to cause about five times as much damage.</p><p>See my talk at the Stanford Existential Risk Initiative (SERI) Conference 2022 for a more detailed discussion of this issue:</p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JJvIR1W-xI&amp;t=1s\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/6JJvIR1W-xI\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><p>This means that expected climate damage increases with uncertainty, because the higher degrees of warming are predicted to be so much more damaging than the lower ones.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpkwfil7bmfk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpkwfil7bmfk\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>Currently, it\u2019s pretty unlikely that we\u2019ll get less than 2 degrees of warming, or more than 4 degrees. If the war makes both of these outcomes more likely, you might think that climate risk stays the same -- it could make things better or worse. But because higher degrees of warming are much more damaging, when events increase the chance that those higher degrees will happen, this outweighs the fact that they might also make optimistic scenarios more likely.</p><h1>Philanthropists should value solutions that are robust and hedgy</h1><p>This might sound abstract and theoretical, but it actually has profound implications for what we ought to do if we want interventions against climate change to have the greatest possible impact.</p><p>To understand this, consider the following two facts:</p><p>First, we are not yet \u2013 and might never be \u2013 in a situation where governments prioritize climate policy when they make decisions that gravely affect emissions. <strong>When push comes to shove, energy security and affordability concerns will dominate climate concerns. This does not mean we should be fatalistic</strong> \u2013 sometimes energy security and climate concerns point in the same direction, and decarbonization policies become more popular than they otherwise would have been thanks to their energy security benefits. Indeed, this is the primary reason for optimism about the war\u2019s climate implications discussed above.</p><p><strong>But it does mean that much of what we care about as climate philanthropists is beyond our control</strong> and related to exogenous circumstances, such as geopolitical conditions, global economic growth and energy demand. The current change in climate trajectories - both positive and negative - is not driven by climate philanthropy or even climate policy, but rather by large scale geopolitical and economic shocks.</p><p>Second, <strong>we can predict things about worlds with high climate risk</strong>.</p><p>For example, in possible future worlds where the invasion of Ukraine did cause more climate risk, we can predict that international climate policy has been derailed, countries have walked back on domestic climate policy targets, and changes in energy policy have turned out to be dominated by additional exploitation of domestic fossil fuels rather than an accelerated clean energy transition.</p><p>We can also imagine more positive changed futures - for example, a future where the world sought greater independence from autocratic fossil fuel suppliers. However, the more pessimistic future harbors the majority of change in climate risk, given the latter\u2019s nonlinear structure.</p><p>It is thus the kind of future we should pay most attention to when seeking to minimize climate damage. As we wrote last year (<a href=\"http://founderspledge.com/landscape\">p.65</a>, emphases added):</p><p>\"The one <i>[background condition affecting climate progress]</i> we are <strong>worried about the most is intense geopolitical competition between great powers or even a great power war, </strong><i><strong>[...]</strong></i><strong>. This is our main argument against being relatively optimistic on decarbonization progress</strong>, the main way in which we could end up in 3+ degree worlds are those where current momentum whittles down.\"</p><p>While we are hopefully still far from a great power war, it is clear that geopolitical tensions have increased significantly and there is a very real risk of international collaboration (on climate) breaking down.</p><p>Importantly, the scenario literature on climate futures and other work also clearly suggest <a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/stories/when-shit-hits-the-fan\">conditions</a>, such as a breakdown of international collaboration, that are likely to be present on a high-emissions pathway, in particular:</p><ol><li>a breakdown of international cooperation (around climate or more broadly);</li><li>&nbsp;a relative failure of intermittent renewables (wind and solar) to decarbonize the entire energy system;</li><li>&nbsp;energy-intensive growth, particularly in emerging economies;</li><li>potentially a technology-fueled growth explosion.</li></ol><p>As absurd as it might sound, we should thus learn from future failure and pursue plans that are <strong>robust</strong> \u2013 working under likely failure conditions \u2013 or, even better, that have a <strong>hedging quality</strong> \u2013 addressing likely failure conditions.</p><p>Key uncertainties without further knowledge about the severity of climate damage:</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669991620/mirroredImages/TfbwBmvmeNGG5D4wY/tgzqitygohnuamcss3yv.jpg\" alt=\"A very uncertain climate future \"></p><p>Key uncertainties knowing we are in a high-damage world:</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669991620/mirroredImages/TfbwBmvmeNGG5D4wY/mxogfjxbcrvh9aas655q.jpg\" alt=\"Learning from future failure\"></p><p>[While there are some obvious implications from a risk-informed perspective and what conditions to be robust to and which failure modes to hedge against (such as those listed here), we believe there likely are many more and we would be keen to get suggestions on what to research more.]<br><br>An example of a robust plan is <strong>advancing clean energy legislation</strong> (for example, the Inflation Reduction Act). This makes sense on the grounds of both national self-interest and green industrial policy, and doesn\u2019t rely on international collaboration to become feasible or effective. Some interventions that hedge against high-damage worlds are <strong>advanced geothermal power, advanced nuclear power</strong>, and other alternatives to solar and wind: these protect against worlds where intermittent renewables \u201cfail\u201d, one of the conditions where climate damage is high.</p><p>Among its many awful consequences, the war in Ukraine shows us this: when we choose climate interventions, it\u2019s really important to remember that our best laid plans can be easily thwarted. In the worst future worlds, we can\u2019t rely on optimistic assumptions. We can\u2019t trust that a few favored climate solutions will work, or that rival nations will be willing and able to cooperate on the most effective interventions. Rather, climate philanthropists should prioritize more robust solutions: solutions that will work even if lots of other things go wrong. While these interventions might not be needed in luckier worlds, in the scariest possible futures, where climate risks are the highest and severe damage is the most likely, we\u2019ll be grateful for them.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>About Founders Pledge</h2><p>Founders Pledge is a community of over 1,700 tech entrepreneurs finding and funding solutions to the world\u2019s most pressing problems.

To date, the fund has allocated more than $10M USD to high-impact climate interventions. Our team is committed to finding the best available giving opportunities in the climate space and filling the most urgent funding needs. This is why, once we\u2019ve made all of our planned grants for 2022, there will be no money remaining in the Fund. Moving forward, we hope to raise much more capital and, as in the past, spend it rapidly on the most effective climate solutions.</p><p>This post will give a high-level overview of how this money has been hard at work (i) accelerating innovation in neglected technologies, (ii) avoiding carbon lock-in in emerging economies, (iii) promoting policy leadership and paradigm shaping, and (iv) catalytically growing organizations during the past two years.</p><p>We start by laying out our basic \u201cmeta\u201d theory of change and why we created the Climate Fund in the first place, before discussing some of the recent successes as well as future plans.</p><h1>Part I: The Why</h1><h3>How to have an impact on climate</h3><p>In a well-funded space such as climate, with philanthropic giving on the order of USD 10 billion per year and societal spending around 100x that at about USD 1 trillion per year, <strong>it is not easy to have a meaningful impact as an individual donor</strong>.</p><p>Indeed, a natural question for any individual might be \u2013 <i>\u201chow can my contribution matter?\u201d</i> \u2013 when several of the world\u2019s richest people, such as Jeff Bezos and Bill Gates, are major climate philanthropists.</p><p>The visual below illustrates this challenge, comparing the Climate Fund at business as usual in 2023 to climate philanthropy at large (about 1000x larger) and societal response (100x larger still):</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669991867/mirroredImages/QbLKFRhbQN8JvtWkM/zijztklzo90rdznom1gk.jpg\" alt=\"A sense of scale\"></p><p>Given the size of existing funding as well as predictable biases in climate philanthropy and our societal climate response, we believe it is overwhelmingly likely that impact-maximizing action for individual donors coming into climate lies in correcting the existing biases of the larger pool of overall climate philanthropy, to fill blindspots and leverage existing attention on climate more effectively. You can <a href=\"http://www.founderspledge.com/landscape\">read</a>, <a href=\"https://www.volts.wtf/p/volts-podcast-johannes-ackva-on-effective\">listen</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fIrGSe0xQtM\">watch</a> more about this in the linked materials.</p><h3>Why a fund?</h3><p>Of course, until now we have not yet answered the question <i>\u201cwhy should this happen through a Fund?\u201d</i>.</p><p>There are several reasons to expect higher impact from a fund than from individual giving:</p><ol><li>The fund model allows us to <strong>make larger, coordinated grants</strong> that enable significant change for grantees, such as hiring new staff and starting new programs;</li><li>Accessible resources allow us to <strong>quickly respond to time-sensitive opportunities</strong>;</li><li>We have the opportunity to <strong>make catalytic grants to early-stage organizations</strong> which do not yet have existing fundraising efforts or long track records, but whose support is \u2013 for these reasons \u2013 more additional and likely has a large multiplier.</li></ol><p>For these reasons, and more <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/why-we-recommend-funds\">here</a>, we generally recommend donating to the Fund rather than specific charities as the highest impact opportunity for individual donors. Doing so is also easier for donors given the Fund can be donated to by everyone from everywhere (e.g. via <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charities/founders-pledge-climate-change-fund\">Giving What We Can</a> or <a href=\"https://www.every.org/climate.change.fund\">every.org</a>, or our <a href=\"http://app.founderspledge.com/\">member app</a> for those with a Founders Pledge Donor Advised Fund (DAF)).</p><h1>Part II: Results</h1><p>In the two years since its inception, the Climate Fund has moved from a nice idea to a vehicle of real world change, and we're now able to report initial results.</p><h3>Catalytic growth of organizations</h3><p>Since 2021, we have made catalytically growing small organizations an explicit part of our grantmaking strategy, motivated by observations of the climate space (large funding influx that small organizations are least likely to profit from) but also by observing the results of our grantmaking and public highlighting, most clearly with the trajectory change in the Clean Air Task Force (CATF)\u2019s (one of our grantees) growth.</p><p>In the figure below, you can see that the funding trajectory of CATF from 2005 until 2018 was fairly static (blue line), and that the public highlighting and grantmaking by Founders Pledge corresponds to a large and sudden increase in annual revenues and a clear trajectory change. Of course, around 2018, many other things changed, such as a general increase in climate philanthropy and attention, so one should be careful to fully attribute this change to our work. For this reason, we constructed four counterfactual scenarios to explain how CATF might have grown without our support, based on the observed change in the growth patterns of similar organizations as well as an optimistic extrapolation of existing growth trends. We display the most optimistic and most pessimistic of these counterfactuals in the figure below, showing that the trajectory change is far beyond what one would expect simply on the general growth of climate organizations at the time (i.e. suggesting that our work therefore did play a significant role therein).</p><p>It is this kind of data that led us to explicitly double down on investing in earlier-stage organizations, and we are now seeing similar, albeit earlier, results with our initial grants to TerraPraxis (TP) (starting in 2020) and Future Cleantech Architects (FCA) (in 2021). (We also see similar results with our grantee Carbon180, however we take considerably less credit here given the recent general growth in attention to carbon removal, which is their area of focus.)</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669991868/mirroredImages/QbLKFRhbQN8JvtWkM/ipkdyhakg8ag14ceh2uu.jpg\" alt=\"Trajectory change\"></p><p>As much as we like our grantees, growing organizations is \u2013 of course \u2013 not a goal in itself but rather part of a strategy to increase the positive impact we can have on the world, which is what we turn to next.</p><h3>Policy successes</h3><p>Alongside our acceleration of promising organizations, we've also witnessed the enacting of all sorts of direct positive change.</p><p>Our grantees have reported \u2013 <strong>many live from COP27 in Egypt</strong> \u2013 the impact that Founders Pledge grantmaking has had on their organizations and, in turn, on their ability to enact change in the world.</p><p>[The <a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/stories/the-climate-change-fund-at-two\">original version of this post</a> also includes videos from grantees, which we did not embed here. With two years passed since our initial grants, we hope to be able to conduct some retrospective impact analysis in 2023 going significantly beyond short video statements from grantees]&nbsp;</p><h3>Globalizing our grantmaking</h3><p>Our initial grantmaking from the Climate Fund focused on innovation advocacy aimed at accelerating global decarbonization through inducing technological change, and was necessarily located primarily in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) economies home to the large majority of energy innovation capacity.</p><p>With the addition of <i>\u201cavoiding carbon lock-in in emerging economies\u201d</i> to our theories of change (since 2021), we have moved to expanding our grantmaking to key emerging economies where future emissions, and infrastructure decisions and investments committing to future emissions, are concentrated.</p><p>When our 2022 grantmaking is finished, the distribution will likely look as below: significant investments not only in the US, but \u2013 crucially \u2013 also in China, India, and Southeast Asia; as well as smaller investments in Europe, the Middle East, and Sub-Saharan Africa, with \u2154 of our 2022 grantmaking focused on emerging economies compared to about \u2155 before 2022.</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669991867/mirroredImages/QbLKFRhbQN8JvtWkM/eroylieabpv17whhodat.jpg\" alt=\"CCF grantmaking in 2022\"></p><h1>Part III: Future Work</h1><p>To continue making high-impact grants, we need to continually re-examine the global and country-specific climate action and philanthropy landscape, to enable us to adapt to changes as opportunities shift, often in unpredictable ways. We now discuss two specific changes which we will analyze in more detail as we believe they meaningfully affect our future grantmaking.</p><h3>A changed innovation landscape</h3><p>Shortly after the Climate Fund's inception, we <a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/stories/the-implications-of-bidens-victory-for-impact-focused-climate-philanthropy\">estimated</a> there was a unique window of policy opportunity after Biden's victory in the US and, putting our money where our mouth was, made large grants from the Climate Fund in response (see discussion above). With major climate policy having been passed in the form of the Bipartisan Infrastructure Bill, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act, and the midterms having ended the Democratic trifecta, it is now time for an updated analysis on future innovation advocacy priorities. As an upcoming companion blog post will illustrate, the US energy innovation effort is now in a much better place than it has been for many decades.</p><p>Upcoming research will re-evaluate climate action in the context of these changes, comparing further US engagement \u2013 is there now vast leverage with improved policy effort or are we hitting diminishing returns? \u2013 to alternatives, such as increased engagement on either European innovation work (like our 2021 grant to FCA) or on pushing the lever on global cooperation in the cleantech transition (as with our 2022 grant to help promote the Breakthrough Agenda report).</p><h3>A darkened and more uncertain global picture</h3><p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine has not only exerted a tremendous humanitarian and geopolitical toll, but has also fundamentally reshaped the world of energy and climate action.</p><p>Two contradictory and yet equally plausible trajectories have emerged from this crisis, and it is quite unclear which one will dominate \u2013 (1) a doubling down on decarbonization as energy security and climate align or (2) a derailing of global cooperation and an increased lock-in to domestic fossil fuels. We have done some initial exploration of this question <a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/stories/the-war-in-ukraine-climate-risk-high-impact-climate-philanthropy\">here</a> \u2013 arguing that in a more uncertain climate future, downside risks dominate \u2013 and will further examine what this means for both long-term grantmaking and taking advantage of opening policy windows (such as a new appreciation of nuclear power) in the short-term.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>With your support, we will continue to execute a research-based grantmaking program aimed at finding and funding the highest impact opportunities in climate. With a track record of two years and first successes materializing in the world, we hope to have demonstrated an ability to make high-impact bets that can affect change far beyond what the modest amounts suggest, by leveraging larger philanthropic and policy budgets to help correct some of the systematic blind spots in our societal climate response.</p><h2>About Founders Pledge</h2><p>Founders Pledge is a community of over 1,700 tech entrepreneurs finding and funding solutions to the world\u2019s most pressing problems.

From our 2020 launch up to the 2022 Giving Season, we conducted broad reviews on 20 climate change approaches and published 10 giving recommendations. We estimate we\u2019ve directed around $3.6M to these recommendations. We\u2019ve made some mistakes along the way and have continually refined our research approach and model.</li>\n<li><strong>Our top recommendations:</strong> We think our top recommendations are the most important way we can have impact. Though there is inherent uncertainty in assessing and comparing the cost-effectiveness of many of these funding opportunities, we believe these recommendations represent organizations and initiatives that can be highly effective with additional philanthropic funding. They include a re-analysis of our previous recommendations, as well as new recommendations focused on food systems, nuclear energy, and decarbonizing heavy industry. Our top recommendations are Clean Air Task Force, Evergreen Collaborative, The Good Food Institute, Good Energy Collective, and Industrious Labs.</li>\n<li><strong>Our research process:</strong> Over the past year, we estimate we spent around 6,000 hours searching for, identifying, evaluating, and publishing research on our recommendations. To identify our 2022 top recommendations, we conducted a broad assessment of the climate philanthropy landscape, identified promising strategies, developed a longlist of organizations working on each strategy, conducted \u201cshallow dive\u201d and subsequent \u201cdeep dive\u201d research on a subset of these organizations, and published recommendations.</li>\n<li><strong>Updates to our process and products:</strong> In addition to thinking about <em>what</em> we should research, we\u2019re also continually making efforts to improve <em>how</em> we conduct and communicate our research. Our improvements focus on two guiding principles: increasing the quality and increasing the transparency of our research. Updates include: formalizing our theory of change and research prioritization; publishing mistakes we\u2019ve made; increasing our reasoning transparency; increasing public-facing research; and expanding citations. We plan to focus more on this in the years to come.</li>\n<li><strong>Key uncertainties and plans to address them:</strong> We aim to be highly transparent about the uncertainties we have in our approach and research. Some of our key overall uncertainties include: whether there is a better way to define and target human suffering due to climate change; how we should think about climate impact today versus tomorrow; within our top recommendations, identifying the most cost-effective giving opportunity; how to allocate our limited research capacity; and how to estimate Giving Green\u2019s marginal value add.</li>\n<li><strong>Our plans for 2023:</strong> We look forward to continuing to engage with the broader climate community to learn and share in the year ahead. As always, we will remain focused on our mission to reduce human suffering due to climate change. Though we will remain flexible and may revise plans, our current top priorities include: executing our plans to address key uncertainties, publishing an annual report, publishing additional information on earlier-stage climate landscape research, expanding research into new topics, and continuing to generally improve the quality and usefulness of our work.</li>\n<li><strong>Appendix:</strong> (1) We formalized an organizational theory of change to help define and assess the ways in which Giving Green might be especially impactful. (2) Due primarily to uncertainty around room for more funding, we no longer include Carbon 180 as a top recommendation. (3) In line with our theory of change, we also have a set of recommendations targeted specifically at businesses.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>What is Giving Green?</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/\">Giving Green</a> is a guide for individuals and businesses to make more effective climate giving decisions. Our mission is to direct donors to highly impactful opportunities to reduce human suffering due to climate change (see <a href=\"#our-theory-of-change\">Appendix: Our theory of change</a>).</p>\n<p>Since Giving Green officially launched in 2020, we\u2019ve been busy.

Though there is inherent uncertainty in assessing and comparing the cost-effectiveness of many of these funding opportunities, we believe these recommendations represent organizations and initiatives that can be highly effective with additional philanthropic funding.</p>\n<p>For those interested in maximizing their impact across current and future top recommendations, we recommend donating via our <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charities/giving-green-fund\">Giving Green Fund</a>. Our current top recommendations are (in alphabetical order):</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.catf.us/\">Clean Air Task Force</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://collaborative.evergreenaction.com/policy-hub/plan?utm_source=givinggreen&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=fundraising\">Evergreen Collaborative</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://goodenergycollective.org/\">Good Energy Collective</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://gfi.org/?utm_source=web&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=GivingGreen\">The Good Food Institute</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://industriouslabs.org/\">Industrious Labs</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Re-evaluation of previous US policy recommendations</h3>\n<p>Historically, we focused our limited research capacity on US policy recommendations.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-5\" id=\"fnref-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-5\">[5]</a></sup> We re-evaluated these recommendations primarily based on (a) a shifting opportunity landscape, (b) a shifting political landscape, and (c) organization-specific changes. For past recommendations focused on passing US federal policy, we also specifically re-evaluated whether and how these organizations planned to shift strategies in light of the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-6\" id=\"fnref-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-6\">[6]</a></sup> Given that the Republican party regained control of the House in the November 2022 midterm elections, we placed additional emphasis on organizations that could continue to be successful without a Democratic trifecta.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-7\" id=\"fnref-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-7\">[7]</a></sup> For organization-specific changes, we paid close attention to criteria that might have changed over the past year, such as whether an organization\u2019s success may have crowded in additional funding and reduced its overall room for more funding.</p>\n<h4>Re-recommendation: Clean Air Task Force</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.catf.us/\">Clean Air Task Force</a> (CATF) is a nonprofit that advocates for public policies that (1) invest in climate-protecting technologies (e.g., low-emission energy sources), (2) curb fossil fuel emissions, or (3) enact pollution regulations. Although it continues to lead on US policy advocacy, it has also scaled its work on technology innovation and commercialization to a global level.</p>\n<p>We recommend CATF because of its strong track record of policy accomplishments at the national level (including policies with bipartisan support), its growing international model, its focus on relatively neglected issue areas, the strength of its staff, and its ability to productively absorb additional funds in coming years.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-8\" id=\"fnref-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-8\">[8]</a></sup> We previously recommended CATF in 2021 and 2020. For more information, see our <a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/us-policy-change-research/clean-air-task-force%3A-deep-dive\">deep dive research report</a> and <a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/us-policy-change-research/clean-air-task-force%3A-recommendation\">recommendation summary</a>.</p>\n<h4>Re-recommendation: Evergreen Collaborative</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://collaborative.evergreenaction.com/policy-hub/plan?utm_source=givinggreen&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=fundraising\">Evergreen Collaborative</a> is a left-of-center insider policy advocacy group that was founded by former staffers of Washington State Governor Jay Inslee\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign. Since its founding, Evergreen Collaborative has focused its efforts on supporting policies that aim to power the economy with 100% clean energy, invest in jobs, support environmental justice, transition the US from fossil fuels, and influence US leadership to confront climate change.</p>\n<p>We first recommended Evergreen Collaborative in 2021, and focused our initial analysis on its federal legislative work.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-9\" id=\"fnref-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-9\">[9]</a></sup> Evergreen successfully advocated for many initiatives that were included in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) such as clean energy tax credits, the green bank, and environmental justice block grants. Following the passage of the IRA, Evergreen Collaborative is now planning to work on bill implementation, state-level policy, and influencing the Biden Administration and federal agencies to take further action on climate. We think Evergreen Collaborative will be impactful in these areas, given its track record of success, organizational strengths, strategic approach, and emphasis on aligning its work to what is most politically tractable. For more information, see our <a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/us-policy-change-research/evergreen-collaborative%3A-deep-dive\">deep dive research report</a> and <a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/us-policy-change-research/evergreen-collaborative%3A-recommendation\">recommendation summary</a>.</p>\n<h3>New top recommendations</h3>\n<p>Thanks to additional research capacity, we also expanded our recommendations to include new efforts we view to be especially promising: food systems, nuclear energy, and decarbonizing heavy industry. In general, these recommendations continue to focus on two overlapping strategies we consider to be highly cost-effective: policy advocacy and technology. In cases where these recommendations have a geographic focus, we assessed whether these efforts might result in global impact, e.g., by developing model regulation that could be replicated elsewhere or advancing technology that could be scaled worldwide.</p>\n<h4>Food systems: The Good Food Institute</h4>\n<p>Currently, livestock emissions play an outsized role in food emissions and are expected to increase in the future. Our take is that shifting demand from carbon-intensive conventional meat to alternative proteins (APs), such as plant-based and cultivated meat, could significantly lower GHG emissions. <a href=\"https://gfi.org/?utm_source=web&amp;utm_medium=link&amp;utm_campaign=GivingGreen\">The Good Food Institute</a> (GFI) is a nonprofit that seeks to make APs competitive with conventional meat in terms of price and taste. It supports AP development through scientific research, policy advocacy, and corporate engagement in the US and abroad.</p>\n<p>We recommend GFI based on its accomplishments, organizational strengths, strategic approach, and cost-effectiveness.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-10\" id=\"fnref-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-10\">[10]</a></sup> We believe GFI has substantial room to grow in its three programmatic areas and across its various offices, and that it will increase the likelihood of alternative proteins going mainstream. Since AP production is still in its early stages, we plan to continue to monitor APs\u2019 climate impact and look forward to following GFI\u2019s efforts in this space. For more information, see our <a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/mitigation-research/the-good-food-institute%3A-deep-dive\">deep dive research report</a> and <a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/mitigation-research/good-food-institute%3A-recommendation\">recommendation summary</a>.</p>\n<h4>Nuclear energy: Good Energy Collective</h4>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.goodenergycollective.org/\">Good Energy Collective</a> (GEC) is a policy research organization that supports \u201cadvanced\u201d nuclear reactors, which are designed to be safer, cheaper, and more versatile than traditional reactors. Nuclear power can decrease GHG emissions if it replaces or avoids dirtier energy sources. For example, it can reduce emissions by complementing renewables because, unlike wind and solar power, nuclear power can produce steady electricity regardless of seasonal or environmental factors. GEC advocates for progressive US policies that support equitable advanced reactor deployment, and engages with local communities to ensure there\u2019s broad support for advanced nuclear.</p>\n<p>We believe GEC fills a neglected niche in increasing advanced reactor deployment, and that it can effectively absorb additional funding. Although GEC primarily focuses on the US, it also has an international diplomacy workstream. We believe its work could have global implications if scaled advanced nuclear power in the US gives other countries the policies, technology, and/or general confidence to also make advanced nuclear part of their clean energy portfolio. We believe GEC has substantial growth potential and that with increased funds, GEC could become more effective by adding staff and scaling its community engagement efforts.

They account for around one-third of greenhouse gas emissions, but have not been a major focus of governments or philanthropists. <a href=\"https://industriouslabs.org/\">Industrious Labs</a> is a new organization dedicated to decarbonizing global heavy industry. In collaboration with partner organizations, Industrious Labs advocates to corporations to make low-carbon commitments, and applies legal and political pressure to governments to ensure there\u2019s regulation and public funding to speed up the transition.</p>\n<p>As a new organization, Industrious Labs has a limited track record but big ambitions. We are excited about its potential for impact because it\u2019s focused on a highly neglected area, its leadership has a track record of success, and we think its comprehensive industry-specific strategies will pull on the right levers to drive industry\u2019s transition. We also think Industrious Labs has substantial growth potential. It\u2019s building dedicated teams for each of its industry-specific campaigns, and there is considerable room to deepen existing campaigns and add new sectors.

Some of our key overall uncertainties include: whether there is a better way to define and target human suffering due to climate change; how we should think about climate impact today versus tomorrow; and within our top recommendations, identifying the most cost-effective giving opportunity. We detail our uncertainties and plans to address them below:</p>\n<p><strong>Is there a better way to define and target human suffering due to climate change?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Uncertainty: We currently use atmospheric GHG levels as a rough proxy for human suffering due to climate change. We think this is an imperfect indicator, but is relatively easy to objectively define, measure, and understand. There may, however, be ways to improve the accuracy of this proxy. For example, we might consider using climate damage functions or general estimates of the social cost of carbon.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-12\" id=\"fnref-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-12\">[12]</a></sup> Other climate change organizations compare funding opportunities based on broader outcomes (e.g., Founders Pledge focuses on \u201cclimate damage\u201d), which gives us some confidence we may be able to better define and use our actual outcome of interest when making recommendation decisions.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-13\" id=\"fnref-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-13\">[13]</a></sup></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Plan: We plan to consider ways in which we might better define our outcome of interest as part of our uncertainty regarding how we should think about climate impact today versus tomorrow (see below).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>How should we think about climate impact today versus tomorrow?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Uncertainty: Currently, we don\u2019t have a well-developed process for comparing the tradeoffs between current and future climate mitigation opportunities, as well as climate suffering. This is especially relevant when comparing funding opportunities targeting (a) short-lived climate pollutants versus (longer-lived) CO2 and (b) near-term GHG reductions versus expected future GHG reductions (e.g., business opportunities to purchase carbon removal credits today versus donating to <a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/carbon-offsets-research/frontier\">Frontier\u2019s advance market commitment</a>).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-14\" id=\"fnref-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-14\">[14]</a></sup> In our cost-effectiveness analyses, we also use a global warming potential of 100 years, which (though widely used) implicitly overweights GHG that have substantial impact within a 100-year period (e.g., refrigerants).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-15\" id=\"fnref-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-15\">[15]</a></sup> As an initial attempt to explore part of this uncertainty, we wrote a preliminary short-lived climate pollutants <a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/us-policy-change-research/cutting-short-lived-climate-pollutants\">report</a> in April 2022, which we think is fairly simplistic and doesn\u2019t take into account some new evidence.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-16\" id=\"fnref-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-16\">[16]</a></sup> We also don\u2019t currently include a formal discount rate for future removed/avoided tCO2e. This may not actually be the best approach if, for example, we think it\u2019s more important to reduce GHG atmospheric levels as soon as possible to avoid tipping elements.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-17\" id=\"fnref-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-17\">[17]</a></sup> On the other hand, reducing GHG atmospheric levels in a long-term worst-case scenario may actually be more important if we\u2019re trying to avoid a scenario of going from 3 degrees to 4 degrees of warming, which we think is likely to cause more human suffering than going from 2 degrees to 3 degrees of warming.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-18\" id=\"fnref-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-18\">[18]</a></sup> Overall, we currently make many qualitative implicit judgment calls on climate impact today versus tomorrow.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Plan: We plan to make additional progress on this, but don\u2019t expect to comprehensively formalize our thinking for two reasons. First, we think the majority of funding opportunities we investigate focus on relatively similar climate change reduction timelines. Second, it\u2019s our impression that there is so much uncertainty regarding longer-term climate forecasts that it could be relatively intractable to have a higher-confidence opinion than we currently have. However, we plan to spend some additional time collecting our thoughts on this in 2023, including making updates to our short-lived climate pollutants report, better understanding the latest evidence on tipping elements, and improving our assessment of the relative neglectedness of different climate change scenarios.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Within our top recommendations, what is the most cost-effective giving opportunity?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uncertainty: We currently have five top recommendations, and think some of these recommendations are probably more cost-effective than others. However, we\u2019re uncertain about the specific cost-effectiveness of each recommendation and, thus, which recommendation is technically the most cost-effective giving opportunity.</li>\n<li>Plan: We think it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019d make so much progress on this that we would be able to recommend a single giving opportunity above others. Our current recommendations represent a range of giving opportunities that we think generally have similar levels of cost-effectiveness within a range of uncertainty.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-19\" id=\"fnref-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-19\">[19]</a></sup> Though some of this uncertainty is inherent to the types of recommendations we make (e.g., it\u2019s extremely difficult to understand what impact Clean Air Task Force had on the Global Methane Pledge), we plan to explore more ways to reduce relative uncertainty. For example, we may try to improve the rigor with which we compare the credibility of theories of change and/or improve our cost-effectiveness analyses.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-20\" id=\"fnref-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-20\">[20]</a></sup></li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Where should we allocate our limited research capacity?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uncertainty: We have limited research capacity, and aren\u2019t certain where it makes sense to allocate our research time. This depends on (a) how much financing we can influence in a given space and (b) how many tCO2e can be removed or avoided due to that financing. For example, we estimate our top recommendations avoid roughly one tCO2e per dollar donated. By contrast, we estimate a one-ton offset purchase via Tradewater costs around $17. As a rough heuristic, it might make sense to focus more research capacity on high-quality offset recommendations if we believe we can influence more than 17 times as much money as for our top recommendations.</li>\n<li>Plan: We don\u2019t think it\u2019s useful to try to improve a direct quantitative comparison such as the one above, as there are other factors that are difficult to quantify. For example: the marginal impact of an additional recommendation in the same sector (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/mitigation-research/decarbonizing-heavy-industry\">decarbonizing heavy industry</a>), the longer-term cost-effectiveness of early-stage funding for relatively expensive initiatives (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/carbon-offsets-research/direct-air-capture\">direct air capture</a>), or the potential longer-term upside of reaching a broader audience by researching high-interest topics (e.g., <a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/carbon-offsets-research/forestry\">forestry offsets</a>). However, we plan to more generally consider heuristics and guiding principles for how we allocate research capacity, which we hope will allow us to be more thoughtful and transparent about how we allocate research capacity. In mid-2023, we expect to make deliberate decisions about how much to focus on top recommendations versus other expectations for the 2023 giving season.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>What is Giving Green\u2019s marginal value add?</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uncertainty: Currently, we use money directed as a rough proxy for our impact. However, this doesn\u2019t clearly (a) explain how we estimate, in the absence of Giving Green, the counterfactual impact of money influenced by Giving Green and (b) estimate the ultimate tCO2e removed/avoided.</li>\n<li>Plan: In 2023, we plan to publish an annual report that details how we estimate our marginal impact, estimates of pessimistic/optimistic/best guess impact scenarios, as well as provide an estimate of tCO2e removed/avoided due to Giving Green.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Our plans for 2023</h2>\n<p>We look forward to continuing to engage with the broader climate community to learn and share in the year ahead. As always, we will remain focused on our mission to reduce human suffering due to climate change. Though we will remain flexible and may revise plans, our current top priorities include: executing our plans to address key uncertainties, publishing an annual report, publishing additional information on earlier-stage climate landscape research, expanding research into new topics, and continuing to generally improve the quality and usefulness of our work.

You can also <a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/contact\">email us directly</a>.</p>\n<h2>Appendix</h2>\n<h3>Our theory of change</h3>\n<h4>Organizational theory of change</h4>\n<p>Giving Green\u2019s mission is to direct donors to highly impactful opportunities to reduce human suffering due to climate change. However, we don\u2019t have a formalized definition of what human suffering means in practice, since it\u2019s hard to define and measure, and is generally open to interpretation. As a proxy, we use greenhouse gas (GHG) atmospheric levels as our outcome of interest. We think this is a useful proxy because it\u2019s easily measurable and, we think, generally leads us to the same conclusions we would\u2019ve made if we tried to directly focus on reducing human suffering due to climate change. However, we\u2019re uncertain about this and plan to explore ways in which we might improve this proxy (see <a href=\"#our-key-uncertainties-and-plans-to-address-them\">Our key uncertainties and plans to address them</a>).</p>\n<p>At a high level, Giving Green\u2019s theory of change follows a five-step process. We produce high-quality recommendations, supporters make donations based on these recommendations, and recommended organizations increase their activities. These activities remove or avoid atmospheric GHG, which subsequently reduces human suffering due to climate change. See Figure 1 for a high-level illustration.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669928389/mirroredImages/frkwqHuZijfvkJbgF/wltlisfyuuskcpucycs5.png\" alt=\"A flowchart representing Giving Green's theory of change. The flowchart contains three types of boxes: yellow input. boxes, blue output boxes, and green outcome boxes. On the left side of the chart, there are two groups of boxes: one, Prospective supporters are aware of GG, cnotains the input GG conducts outreach activities (media, newsletter, etc.) and the output GG is promoted by advocates; the other group, GG produces high-quality recommendations, contains three inputs that follow each other in this order, GG prioritizes high-impact research, GG conducts high-quality research, and GG produces recommendations. An arrow indicates that these two groups both lead to a third group, Supporters make giving decisions based on GG, which contains three outputs: Supporters change giving, Supporters increase giving, and Supporters decide to give. This group, in turn, leads to a fourth group, GG recomendees increase activities, which contains the outputs Highly cost-effective recipients increase activities and (For donors with donation preferences, e.g. offsets) Relatively more cost-effective recipients increase activities. This group leads to a fifth group, Reduced atmospheric GHG, which contains two outcomes, Avoided emissions and Reduced emissions. This group leads to the final outcome on the right-hand side, Reduced human suffering.\" title=\"Figure 1: Flowchart representing Giving Green's theory of change\"></p>\n<p>Figure 1. Giving Green organizational theory of change</p>\n<h4>Research prioritization</h4>\n<p>So what does our theory of change imply for how we should prioritize our research, given limited research capacity? We think there are two ways our research and recommendations can be especially impactful: (1) Direct funding to highly cost-effective giving opportunities and (2) in high-interest giving areas, reallocate funding from low-impact opportunities to higher-impact opportunities.</p>\n<p>We think directing funding to highly cost-effective giving opportunities is the most important research Giving Green can focus on, since it\u2019s our impression that these organizations are able to do substantially more with each dollar than some of the most well-known philanthropic opportunities. These are our \u201c<a href=\"#our-top-recommendations\">top recommendations</a>\u201d.</p>\n<p>Since high-interest areas attract substantial attention and financing, we also think focusing on these areas can have a positive impact. Our current high-interest research includes: carbon removal opportunities for businesses, carbon offsets for businesses, and Australia-specific recommendations.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-21\" id=\"fnref-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-21\">[21]</a></sup></p>\n<p>For both our top recommendations and high-interest areas, we think donors sometimes have restrictions or self-imposed preferences that cause them to give less (overall and/or to specific initiatives) than they would otherwise give. For example, a business with net-zero goals might donate $10,000 to our <a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/carbon-offsets-research/frontier\">Frontier carbon removal recommendation</a>, but would never donate to our US policy recommendations due to fears of being perceived by customers as political or partisan. An Australia-based donor may be more likely to give to Australian nonprofits for tax-deductibility reasons. We also consider this when prioritizing some research areas above others.</p>\n<p>We\u2019re uncertain about the tradeoffs we make when deciding how to prioritize research (see <a href=\"#our-key-uncertainties-and-plans-to-address-them\">Key uncertainties</a>). We plan to reassess our approach in 2023 to ensure our research capacity is focused on where we can have the most impact.</p>\n<h3>No longer including as a top recommendation: Carbon180</h3>\n<p>Based on our re-evaluation, we decided to no longer include <a href=\"https://carbon180.org/\">Carbon180</a> as a top recommendation. Our assessment is that Carbon180 has been highly effective in advancing its mission and securing additional funding, which suggests marginal donations may be less cost-effective relative to our other recommendations. Our impression is that carbon removal, in general, has also gained substantial philanthropic attention over the past year, and we believe it will continue to be a major focus of climate donors. In particular, we think the recent passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and Inflation Reduction Act increased the visibility of and financial support for carbon removal projects, and may pave the way for additional philanthropic support for carbon removal advocacy. We could be wrong if Carbon180 has longer-term room for more funding, recent carbon removal policy support increases the leverage of philanthropic dollars, or carbon removal becomes less of a philanthropic and government focus in the years to come. We plan to continue to monitor this, and are looking forward to following Carbon180\u2019s progress. For more information, see our <a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/us-policy-change-research/carbon180%3A-deep-dive\">deep dive research report</a>.</p>\n<h3>Our recommendations for businesses</h3>\n<p>Businesses are increasingly interested in determining how they can reduce climate change.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-22\" id=\"fnref-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-22\">[22]</a></sup> However, businesses often have unique giving criteria (e.g., they may have net-zero goals or avoid donations that could be interpreted as partisan). We believe there is an opportunity to help businesses re-allocate funding from low-impact opportunities to higher-impact opportunities.</p>\n<p>We wrote a <a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/carbon-offsets-research/how-to-think-beyond-net-zero\">white paper</a> outlining various high-impact corporate climate strategies that businesses can adopt, either through making investments in decarbonizing their own operations or donating to impactful organizations. We followed a similar research process to that of our top recommendations, and additionally conducted user research to ensure our recommendations would be applicable to business-specific criteria and preferences. In order of priority, we recommend businesses (a) consider cost-effective opportunities to directly reduce their own emissions, (b) donate to our <a href=\"#our-top-recommendations\">top recommendations</a>, (c) donate to carbon removal funds, and (d) purchase high-quality carbon removal or offset credits. Our specific recommendations for businesses include making catalytic investments in carbon removal though the <a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/carbon-offsets-research/frontier\">Frontier</a> or <a href=\"http://givinggreen.earth/carbon-offsets-research/milkywire\">Milkywire</a> funds; buying carbon removal from <a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/carbon-offsets-research/mash-makes\">Mash Makes</a>, <a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/carbon-offsets-research/charm-industrial\">Charm Industrial</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/carbon-offsets-research/climeworks\">Climeworks</a>; or buying high-quality carbon offsets from <a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/carbon-offsets-research/tradewater\">Tradewater</a> or <a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/carbon-offsets-research/burn\">BURN</a>.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-XqA3H4Zq9HnBu7Faa-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Rough estimate, calculated by reviewing topics listed under Giving Green\u2019s \u201cResearch\u201d dropdown menu as of 2022-10.

Introduction</h2><p>Sometimes, people try to use meta-ethics to argue that pleasure and pain are the only things that matter. In particular, they say, we have a certain type of direct epistemic access to the goodness of pleasure and the badness of pain \u2013 access that we don\u2019t have to other candidate values. So the value/disvalue of pleasure/pain are on solid meta-ethical footing in a way that other values are not.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmrgv3dh9klm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmrgv3dh9klm\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Call this argument \u201cmeta-ethical hedonism.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpibehwh248\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpibehwh248\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>I think this is a bad argument. This essay explains why. In brief:</p><ul><li>Suppose you\u2019re a non-naturalist about meta-ethics (that is, you think that the value of pleasure is something over and above pleasure itself, and irreducible to anything in the natural world). In that case, the argument fails to answer the <a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2022/01/17/the-ignorance-of-normative-realism-bot\">basic epistemic objection to non-naturalism</a> \u2013 namely, that it leaves us without the right type of epistemic access to the non-natural properties in question. In particular, positing a mysterious faculty of \u201cdirect acquaintance\u201d with your phenomenal properties doesn\u2019t help (even if such a faculty were otherwise legit), because phenomenal properties are natural properties.</li><li>Now suppose instead that you are naturalist about meta-ethics (that is, you think that normative properties are identical with some set of natural properties). In that case, your direct acquaintance (if you had it) with phenomenal properties \u2013 and thus, with a certain type of natural property \u2013 would still do no work in telling you <i>which natural properties matter</i>. Rather, to figure out that out, you need to do some combination of conceptual work, to understand how a concept like \u201cgoodness\u201d picks out its natural referent, and empirical work, to check what that referent is. And direct acquaintance with the pleasantness of pleasure does neither.</li></ul><p>Maybe this summary makes the issue sound complicated, but it really isn\u2019t. Ultimately, pleasure is just another natural thing, and direct acquaintance, if it exists, just another way of detecting and comprehending a certain type of natural thing. Nothing unique has been offered that would bridge (or explain away) the divide between is and ought.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbsquch5h1lr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbsquch5h1lr\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The basic game of normative epistemology remains unaltered.</p><p>Indeed, I suspect that the appeal of meta-ethical hedonism derives at least in part from mixing normative epistemology together with the epistemology of consciousness in a manner that allows confusions about the latter to disguise muddiness about both. This isn\u2019t to say that confusions about the epistemology of consciousness aren\u2019t relevant to normative epistemology \u2013 I think they might well be. But I think the best meta-ethical view in this vicinity (what I call the \u201cmystery view\u201d) wears its confusion and mysterianism more forthrightly on its sleeve \u2013 and I don\u2019t think it gives much support to hedonism in particular.</p><h2>2. What is meta-ethical hedonism?</h2><p>In my experience, various strains of meta-ethical hedonism are quite common amongst utilitarian-ish moral realist-ish folks. Developed public arguments for the view, however, seem to me relatively thin on the ground \u2013 and many of these focus on a naturalist version that seems to me less interesting (more below).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefygl3zwmu2dh\"><sup><a href=\"#fnygl3zwmu2dh\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I\u2019m going to try to hone in on what I see as the core claims, and the core mistakes, but I won\u2019t be able to cover all the possible variants.</p><p>I see meta-ethical hedonism as trying to do two types of work:</p><ul><li>First, it\u2019s trying to defend normative realism \u2013 and specifically, to defend it against objections to do with our epistemic access to the objective normative truths.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6je7xmtbiaf\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6je7xmtbiaf\">[5]</a></sup></span></li><li>Second, it\u2019s trying to defend some form of hedonism about normativity \u2013 that is, some view to the effect that pleasure and pain are only things that matter intrinsically.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2m4n8opvzsd\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2m4n8opvzsd\">[6]</a></sup></span></li></ul><p>The argument is generally something like:</p><ol><li>We have a distinctive sort of epistemic access to the value of pleasure \u2013 one that we lack with respect to other candidate values, norms, and so on.</li><li>This sort of epistemic access is immune to the sorts of epistemic worries that otherwise plague normative realism. &nbsp;</li><li>Thus, we are justified in being normative realists, but only justified in believing in the value of pleasure.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5eyqgiczxub\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5eyqgiczxub\">[7]</a></sup></span></li></ol><p>Why go in for this sort of argument? The core move is to draw a connection between (a) your epistemic access to your subjective experience (i.e., your phenomenology, \u201cwhat it\u2019s like to be you\u201d) and (b) your epistemic access to the value of pleasure. Pleasure, after all, seems tied up with subjective experience somehow (though exactly how is a further question). And many people think that our epistemic access to our subjective states is both superior to, and more \u201cdirect\u201d than, our epistemic access to the external world. So maybe we have that unique sort of epistemic access to the value of pleasure, too? And maybe this means we can still be normative realists after all?</p><p>Thus, consider your experience of that famously unproblematic object/property/way of experiencing/whatever: phenomenal red \u2013 the red of a ripe tomato, say, but as it appears in your mind (read: on the screen of your cartesian theater), rather than in the objective world. Aren\u2019t you just so \u201cup close and personal\u201d with phenomenal red? Aren\u2019t you just \u201cconfronting\u201d phenomenal red? Isn\u2019t the nature of phenomenal red just \u201claid bare\u201d to your inner gaze? If someone were to be like: \u201cnah, dude, phenomenal red <a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2020/11/29/grokking-illusionism\">isn\u2019t the way it seems</a>,\u201d wouldn\u2019t you be like \u201cget out of here with such talk; phenomenal red <i>just is</i> the way phenomenal red seems; my epistemic encounter with phenomenal red is not subject to standard sorts of fallibility, like the sort created by distinctions between appearance and reality.\u201d &nbsp;</p><p>And if we say this, can we say the same about the value of pleasure? The meta-ethicist worries: \u201csure, pleasure <i>seems</i> good; but maybe pleasure is not as it seems.\u201d Can you reply as follows? \u201cGet out of here with such talk. The goodness of pleasure is like the redness of phenomenal red; I experience it directly; it is \u2018laid bare\u2019 before my inner gaze; it\u2019s not subject to the normal distinctions between appearance and reality.\u201d</p><p>This, at least, is the sort of thing that meta-ethical hedonists want to say. And they hope to make, from this, an argument like 1-3 above.</p><h3>2.1 This isn\u2019t about how much you like pleasure</h3><p>Note the distinction between this argument and a different argument, namely: \u201cMan, I just have such a strong intuition that pleasure is good. No way I\u2019m doubting that. And I have a much stronger intuition that pleasure is good than [blah other normative thing].\u201d</p><p>The point here is not about the <i>strength</i> of your conviction that pleasure is good (I\u2019m happy to grant that our convictions about the value of pleasure \u2013 and even more so, the disvalue of pain \u2013 are unusually strong). The point here is about the <i>source</i> of this conviction \u2013 and in particular, whether its source is uniquely immune to normative realism\u2019s epistemic problems, in virtue of some <i>qualitative </i>distinction between it and other sources of normative conviction.</p><p>Indeed, despite my disagreements with meta-ethical hedonism, I want to be clear that I, too, like pleasure a lot. In fact, I have <a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2021/07/19/in-search-of-benevolence-or-what-should-you-get-clippy-for-christmas#ii-does-clippy-think-you-re-selfish\">written previously</a> in opposition to those who denigrate the sort of optimized but not-obviously-appetizing pleasure (\u201chedonium\u201d) that hedonistic utilitarians cherish:</p><blockquote><p>pleasure which, for all the disdain with which some throw around the word,&nbsp;would appear to you, if you could experience it, not as a twitching lab rat on a heroin drip, but as something of sublimity and energy and boundlessness; something roaring with life and laughter and victory and love; something oceanic, titanic, breathtaking; something, indeed, beyond all this,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2021/01/18/actually-possible-thoughts-on-utopia#ii-sublime-utopias\">far beyond</a>. I am&nbsp;<a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2021/02/14/contact-with-reality\">not a hedonist</a>&nbsp;\u2014 but I think that casual scorn towards the notion of pleasure, especially&nbsp;<i>actually optimal</i>&nbsp;pleasure (not just ha-ha optimal, cold optimal, sterile optimal), is foolish indeed.</p></blockquote><p>I say this partly because my sense is that some meta-ethical hedonists take themselves to be unusually <i>impressed</i> by the significance of pleasure and pain \u2013 to have seen more clearly than others that pleasure is just <i>so </i>good, and pain <i>so</i> bad. And perhaps they have. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s an important crux, at least here.</p><p>Indeed, the crux isn\u2019t, even, the plausibility of hedonism per se. I think there are plenty of interesting arguments for hedonism out there.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefukij5gkyk9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnukij5gkyk9\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;But we should be careful not to conflate our sympathy (or lack of sympathy) towards those arguments with an assessment of 1-3 above.</p><h3>2.2 An example of a non-hedonistic intuition, for use in contrast</h3><p>It will be useful, in what follows, to have an example of a non-hedonistic normative intuition on the table, so that we can compare its epistemic status with our intuitions about the value of pleasure. Consider:</p><blockquote><p><i>Phoebe the physicist</i>. By day, Phoebe is hard at work on what\u2019s on track to be a Nobel Prize-winning theory of super-duper symmetry. By night, she spends time with her loving family. Phoebe has very strong views about experience machines. In particular, she strongly prefers living in the real world, with her real family, and to be understanding the real physics, over a somewhat-more-pleasurable life in an experience machine, with a <a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2021/02/14/contact-with-reality#ii-being-alone\">fake, unconscious family</a>, developing <a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2021/02/14/contact-with-reality#iii-being-wrong\">flimsy and confused theories that are false even about the physics of the machine world</a>. In fact, Phoebe is an official signatory of a strange website called \u201cDON\u2019T YOU <i>DARE</i> PUT ME IN AN EXPERIENCE MACHINE WITHOUT MY CONSENT.com\u201d \u2013 a choice she made after being declared sound-of-mind by ten leading psychologists. She also printed out a form with this same statement, signed it in the presence of the local notary, and hung it on her front door. &nbsp;</p><p>But Allan the altruist knows better. Allan has been reading philosophy. He\u2019s become quite convinced that actually, pleasure and pain are the only things that matter intrinsically. Plus, for some reason, he has ninja stealth and advanced tech. He sees that the experiences of his next-door neighbor, Phoebe, are on track to contain less value than they could with his help. So, one day, he drugs and kidnaps Phoebe while she\u2019s asleep, puts her in an experience machine, and replaces her with an unconscious Phoebe-android-doll that her family will never tell from the original. Now, the real Phoebe floats all day in a glass vat \u2013 trapped, stuffed with tubes, wrong and foolish about physics (even the simulated physics), alone, surrounded only by simulated cardboard dolls she mistakes for persons, but with more pleasure, and less pain. If she could see her condition, she would be writhing in protest; clawing the tubes from her body; trying to break the glass with her fists. But Allan keeps her nice and quiet.</p><p>Wendell the witness lives across the street, and he can see through walls. Wendell watches the whole affair, and he has the strong intuition that what Allan is doing is wrong, even if it increases the net pleasure in the world \u2013 and in particular, that Allan has violated Phoebe\u2019s autonomy is an absolutely unacceptable way. Wendell forms a strong desire to take <a href=\"https://youtu.be/2Cy-1YgLTh0?t=142\">an axe to the vat</a>, and to set Phoebe free.</p></blockquote><p>Now, obviously, hedonists will have a lot to say about why Allan shouldn\u2019t have done what he did \u2013 and a lot, as well, about why Wendell\u2019s intuition tracks valid instrumental considerations and heuristics grounded, ultimately, in hedonistic considerations.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefoh8uygzw10a\"><sup><a href=\"#fnoh8uygzw10a\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Anyone who has ever argued with utilitarians about counter-examples will be familiar with this sort of (not-especially-satisfying) dialectic \u2013 and I\u2019m not, here, interested in whether hedonistic attempts to deflate/debunk/rescue intuitions like Wendell\u2019s succeed. &nbsp;</p><p>Rather, I simply want to note what I think even most hedonists will concede: namely, that the intuition presents itself as granting intrinsic significance to something other than pleasure and pain. Indeed, for me at least, the intuition skips over questions about whether Allan made Phoebe\u2019s life worse, or the world worse, and cuts directly to the way Allan has contravened Phoebe\u2019s <i>will</i>. Phoebe\u2019s life is her own. She gets to <i>choose</i> whether or not she goes into the machine. She chose \u201cno\u201d extremely hard \u2013 and Allan has done horrible violence to this \u201cno.\u201d The pleasure at stake is not the point.</p><p>Or at least, let\u2019s say that this is how Wendell describes his intuition. And let\u2019s say that the meta-ethical hedonist grants this description. Still, the meta-ethical hedonist will argue, this intuition is importantly and qualitatively different from Wendell\u2019s intuition that the pleasure he gets from sinking into a hot bath is good. In particular (and regardless of other differences between the cases<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5bzv1gjy4pb\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5bzv1gjy4pb\">[10]</a></sup></span>), Wendell\u2019s epistemic relationship to the pleasure involves the sort of directness and unmediated-ness and \u201claid-bare-ness\u201d at stake with phenomenal red. Whereas, according to the meta-ethical hedonist, his epistemic relationship to Allan\u2019s violation of Phoebe\u2019s autonomy is somehow more \u201cdistant\u201d and indirect \u2013 and thus, more subject to objection.</p><h3>2.3 Setting aside some issues in philosophy of mind</h3><p>Let\u2019s call the special form of epistemic access being appealed to here \u201cdirect acquaintance.\u201d For some people, including myself, this sort of appeal is already a red flag. In particular, it\u2019s not clear what direct acquaintance consists in (though see <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/knowledge-acquaindescrip/#ConVieAcq\">here</a> for some discussion),<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefz17qum1u1b\"><sup><a href=\"#fnz17qum1u1b\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;how we\u2019d tell if it exists, and what sort of backdrop conception of mind it assumes \u2013 so one worries about smuggling in various confusions and mistakes right off the bat. Indeed, my impression is that advocates of direct acquaintance often take it as a fairly brute notion.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwupe4gh8j5\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwupe4gh8j5\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Perhaps you can point at it via reference to its properties or its role in the rest of epistemology,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref26jhxrj4boh\"><sup><a href=\"#fn26jhxrj4boh\">[13]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;but it gets most of its credibility from some kind of pre-theoretic intuition that it\u2019s a thing (indeed, apparently one defense of direct acquaintance is that we\u2019re directly acquainted with it).</p><p>More generally, vibes to the effect that introspection gives us some qualitatively distinct/nigh-infallible/unable-to-be-doubted/\u201cself-intimating\u201d epistemic access to our mental states (including, even, our phenomenal states) have been subject to a variety of empirical and theoretical objections over the years.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgywotcnmwdg\"><sup><a href=\"#fngywotcnmwdg\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I\u2019m not going to wade into this debate here, but if I was into meta-ethical hedonism, I\u2019d expect to have to grapple with it.</p><p>And as a more general red flag re: meta-ethical hedonism (depending on your orientation towards the philosophy of mind \u2013 c.f. <a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2020/11/29/grokking-illusionism\">illusionism</a>), you might worry, as well, about the Cartesian vibes, the \u201csense data\u201d vibes, the general centrality of qualia to the view in question, and the absence of physical/computational analyses of the main moving parts. Advocates of meta-ethical hedonism will emphasize its compatibility with a wide variety of views in philosophy of mind \u2013 and perhaps, technically, yes. But at least in some discussions of the topic, one senses a taste for more metaphysically inflationary (or at least, non-reductive) approaches to consciousness. After all, if consciousness is going to be the only thing that matters, and our epistemic access to consciousness is going to be super different from our epistemic access to other things, then it\u2019s natural to want consciousness to be, well, really quite special and substantive stuff \u2013 not just, as it were, another way that matter can move around. (How would you get \u201cdirect acquaintance\u201d with movements of matter, anyway? Via what mechanisms could such movements be \u201claid bare\u201d?).</p><p>Indeed, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s an accident that two prominent advocates of (something like) meta-ethical hedonism (Rawlette and Pearce) have quite non-standard views about consciousness: Rawlette has a book arguing for the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beyond-Death-Evidence-Survival-Consciousness/dp/1733995749\">survival of consciousness after death</a> (see also her work on <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Source-Significance-Coincidences-Astonishing-Evidence/dp/1733995706\">synchronicity</a>), and Pearce is some sort of idealist-physicalist,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefv0lycs27g6e\"><sup><a href=\"#fnv0lycs27g6e\">[15]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;who believes that <a href=\"https://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/binding-interview.html\">classical computers can\u2019t be conscious because they cannot solve the \u201cbinding problem.\u201d</a> Of course, regardless of whether we agree with Rawlette and Pearce on these fronts, we should assess the arguments for meta-ethical hedonism on their own terms (and the fact that some people treat \u201cCartesian\u201d and \u201csense-data\u201d and \u201cqualia\u201d like insults isn\u2019t, actually, an argument either). But I think the connection between the appeal of meta-ethical hedonism and the appeal of more inflationary/non-standard views of consciousness is worth tracking, and I discuss it more in the final section.</p><p>In the meantime, though, I want to set these issues in the philosophy of mind aside, and basically just <i>grant</i> the meta-ethical hedonist some notion of direct acquaintance with phenomenal states \u2013 including, if necessary, phenomenal states construed in some non-reductive sense. This is partly because I do think it intuitive that our epistemic access to e.g. the nature of phenomenal red is in some sense uniquely direct (and I think non-reductionism about consciousness has intuitions in its favor as well). But more importantly, I think that meta-ethical hedonism fails <i>even if we grant its basic assumptions</i> <i>about the philosophy of mind</i> \u2013 and I think this failure should be our focus.</p><p>In this spirit, I also want to grant a claim that some meta-ethical hedonists seem especially excited to argue about: namely, the claim that there is some distinctive (and maybe: non-representational? not sure if this matters) phenomenal quality associated with pleasure. The thought is, roughly, that there is a particular way that pleasure <i>feels </i>\u2013 namely, \u201cgood\u201d \u2013 and that it\u2019s in virtue of something\u2019s feeling this way that it\u2019s a pleasure at all. This is the way of feeling that the hedonist treats as the only thing worth promoting, protecting, and so forth for its own sake. I\u2019ll sometimes call this feeling \u201cpositive valence\u201d or \u201cpositive hedonic tone.\u201d</p><p>There are lots of other conceptions of pleasure in the literature as well (see <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pleasure/\">here</a> for discussion), and naively, it seems like meta-ethical hedonism will be on shakier ground if you adopt one of those (since if pleasure has no distinctive phenomenal quality, the analogy with our epistemic access to e.g. phenomenal red is weaker). But here, again, I\u2019m happy to grant the meta-ethical hedonist the phenomenology she wants. The core problems lie elsewhere. Let\u2019s turn to those (finally) now.</p><h2>3. Meta-ethical hedonism for non-naturalists?</h2><p>As readers of my other <a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/category/meta-ethics\">essays on meta-ethics</a> might be aware, I tend to group meta-ethical views into two categories.</p><ul><li>On the one hand, there are the robust, non-naturalist realists, who think that the normative domain is something genuinely and irreducibly <i>extra</i>, relative to the natural world (more <a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2021/01/03/the-despair-of-normative-realism-bot#i-more-than-the-natural-world\">here</a>).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbj8jur7x4wv\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbj8jur7x4wv\">[16]</a></sup></span></li><li>And on the other hand, there\u2019s everyone else \u2013 that is, all the views that accept that the natural world is all there is, and which focus on arguing about which part of it (if any) is the normativity part.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0g6o5h7dbvfr\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0g6o5h7dbvfr\">[17]</a></sup></span></li></ul><p>Characterizing \u201cnatural,\u201d here, is a bit tricky. Often, it means something like: \u201cyou know, the science-y stuff.\u201d But because we are here going to be talking about consciousness a lot, and because consciousness\u2019s status as part of the \u201cscience-y stuff\u201d isn\u2019t always clear, I think it\u2019s probably best, here, to construe \u201cnatural\u201d more broadly, as indicating the realm of the descriptive as opposed to the evaluative, \u201cis\u201d as opposed to \u201cought.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreff6nd0o8zn8h\"><sup><a href=\"#fnf6nd0o8zn8h\">[18]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Thus, on this definition, dualism about consciousness is compatible with naturalism. Yes, dualists posit stuff that is irreducibly over and above the <i>physical</i>; and maybe, even, stuff that the standard tools of science can\u2019t touch. But the stuff in question is still fundamentally descriptive stuff, <i>is</i>-stuff. It\u2019s the kind of stuff that the nihilist, at least naively (more below on possible disputes), can coherently accept into his/her world-picture, without thereby giving up her nihilism.</p><p>I see the question of whether normativity constitutes an irreducibly extra realm, over and above the natural world, as the most interesting one in meta-ethics. Once we answer \u201cno\u201d to that (as I think we likely should), it becomes unclear to me how substantive additional debate in meta-ethics becomes: we all agree on what exists, so it seems plausible that we\u2019re mostly arguing about how to use words<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrb6xf7dv8l\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrb6xf7dv8l\">[19]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;\u2013 and even granted that it ends up making most sense to label some particular bit of the natural world \u201cnormativity,\u201d it\u2019s not clear what grounds the <i>authority</i> of that bit over our practical deliberation.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefk75gg44swe\"><sup><a href=\"#fnk75gg44swe\">[20]</a></sup></span></p><p>What\u2019s more, it\u2019s centrally in the context of a non-naturalist meta-ethics that the most pressing epistemic problems for normative realism arise. In particular, a metaphysics that places normative properties beyond the natural world makes it extremely unclear how our natural minds ever get the right sort of epistemic access to them. Exactly how to frame this objection most perspicuously is a somewhat open question (I give my own account <a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2022/01/17/the-ignorance-of-normative-realism-bot\">here</a>), but as an intuition pump: consider that on non-naturalism, all of your evaluative beliefs, intuitions, and attitudes are the product of a causal history that is not sensitive to, explained by, or dependent on the existence or the distribution of the non-natural normative properties, since those non-natural properties are (at least according to the most standard forms of non-naturalist realism) \u201ccausally inert.\u201d That is, if it were the case that the non-natural property of goodness supervened on \u201ceating bricks\u201d instead of on \u201cpleasure,\u201d or if there weren\u2019t any non-natural properties at all, you\u2019d have all the same evaluative attitudes that you do now. In this sense, your attitudes do not <i>co-vary</i> with the normative properties. Such properties live in their own separate, inaccessible realm, floating on top of (but never influencing or interacting with) the one where all your belief-formation takes place. And this makes it very hard to see how some specific set of beliefs about the content of this realm (i.e., \u201cnon-natural goodness supervenes on pleasure but not on eating bricks\u201d) could be justified. And the same holds, indeed, for the belief that the realm exists at all.</p><p>This is the objection to non-naturalist realism that I take most seriously. And I\u2019m most interested in meta-ethical hedonism insofar as it purports to show that in virtue of something about direct acquaintance, this objection <i>does not apply</i> to the goodness of pleasure. If true, this would grant new hope to non-naturalist realism.</p><p>But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s true.</p><h3>3.1 The basic problem</h3><p>The basic problem is that pleasure is just another natural thing. This is true even if we construe pleasure as a phenomenal property, and even if we construe phenomenal properties in a non-reductive, non-physicalist sense. Still, direct acquaintance with phenomenal properties will not grant us epistemic access to some further, non-natural realm of normative facts. All it gets us is more \u201cis.\u201d</p><p>Of course, we can posit an <i>additional</i>, yet-further epistemic faculty for accessing such a normative realm (e.g. \u201crational intuition\u201d). But non-hedonists can do this, too \u2013 a focus on phenomenal properties, and on the directness of our acquaintance with them, is not required.</p><p>Alternatively, we can try to just state, baldly, that the same faculty that puts us into direct acquaintance with phenomenal properties <i>also</i> gives us access to the further, non-natural realm of normativity. But this is a substantive expansion of our usual notion of direct acquaintance \u2013 one that does not inherit whatever antecedent plausibility the notion had in the context of our access to our phenomenal states, and which raises the same problems that other posited forms of access to non-natural normativity (e.g., rational intuition) do.</p><p>Here I\u2019ll go through these considerations in turn. Before jumping in, though, I want to acknowledge that I do feel sympathy for some vibe in the vicinity of the views I\u2019m objecting to, here. In particular, I do think that the problems involved in positing any sort of epistemic access (whether direct or indirect) to non-reductively-construed phenomenal states <i>mirror</i> the problems involved in positing epistemic access to a non-natural normative realm, in a way that might prompt suspicion that they will stand or fall together. And more generally, consciousness seems sufficiently mysterious, from the perspective of a broadly reductionist worldview, that <i>if</i> such a worldview is wrong in a way that makes room for epistemic access to a non-natural normative realm, we might expect the mistake to be tied up with consciousness somehow. But in my opinion, the view that emerges from taking these sorts of considerations seriously \u2013 what I call the \u201cmystery view\u201d \u2013 does not look very much like meta-ethical hedonism. I discuss this issue more in the final section of the essay.</p><h3>3.2 Some diagrams</h3><p>For now, let\u2019s look at some diagrams. Here\u2019s a diagram of the basic epistemic problem for non-naturalist realism.</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669941657/mirroredImages/7dGZnj7bwpM2kSJqm/euot5fwi1hxdunkep1qd.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://jc.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2.png 816w, https://jc.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2-300x185.png 300w, https://jc.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2-768x474.png 768w, https://jc.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2-402x248.png 402w, https://jc.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2-462x285.png 462w, https://jc.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2-662x409.png 662w, https://jc.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-2-722x446.png 722w\"></p><p><i>Figure 1: The basic epistemic for non-naturalist realism</i></p><p>That is, in brief, the problem is that the green \u201cmy epistemology\u201d node is only touching the orange \u201cwhatever natural properties normativity supervenes on\u201d node (and the \u201csupervenience\u201d arrow doesn\u2019t transfer the \u201ctouching\u201d property in the right way). Thus, you could erase the blue \u201cnon-natural normative properties\u201d node, or you could move it (and its supervenience arrow) to hover over some other set of natural properties (e.g., \u201ceating bricks\u201d), and the green \u201cmy epistemology\u201d node wouldn\u2019t notice. Hence the red \u201cno epistemic access\u201d arrow between my epistemology and normative realm.</p><p>Now let\u2019s see what happens if we add in the machinery of meta-ethical hedonism:</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669941657/mirroredImages/7dGZnj7bwpM2kSJqm/uo5rexrqsurcttgrgecy.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://jc.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-11-30-at-11.26.07-PM-300x224.png 300w, https://jc.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-11-30-at-11.26.07-PM-402x300.png 402w, https://jc.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Screen-Shot-2022-11-30-at-11.26.07-PM-722x538.png 722w\"></p><p><i>Figure 2: The picture suggested by non-naturalist meta-ethical hedonism</i></p><p>What\u2019s changed? Well, we have a new (and more mysterious) type of epistemic relationship in the mix (\u201cdirect acquaintance\u201d); we\u2019ve taken a stand on the specific sort of natural property that the non-natural normative properties supervene on (namely, the phenomenology of pleasure); and we\u2019ve got a new yellow arrow pointing at <i>that property</i> as well, which (if we construe it in terms of supervenience) seems a bit <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7DmA3yWwa6AT5jFXt/zombies-redacted\">worrying</a> given the problems that the yellow supervenience arrow in the last diagram created (though I\u2019m leaving open the option of construing the phenomenology of pleasure in more reductionist/physicalist terms as well).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref17yshh95jnd\"><sup><a href=\"#fn17yshh95jnd\">[21]</a></sup></span></p><p>But for all this, have we improved our epistemic position with respect to the non-natural normative properties? I don\u2019t see how we have (though we\u2019ve introduced a sufficiently mysterious form of epistemic access, and a sufficiently more complicated ontology, that we might be more liable to confuse ourselves). For example, if we wiped away the \u201cnon-natural normative properties\u201d node, or moved it to hover over some other set of natural properties (i.e., \u201ceating bricks\u201d), the \u201cmy epistemology\u201d node still wouldn\u2019t notice. Perhaps direct acquaintance gives us some qualitatively different form of epistemic access to a certain type of natural property \u2013 namely, pleasure. But the <i>goodness</i> of pleasure is still <i>floating on top of pleasure itself</i>, off in that extra realm that our natural minds can\u2019t touch. Appeals to direct acquaintance don\u2019t change that. So the red \u201cno epistemic access\u201d arrow persists.</p><h3>3.3 Dialogue with the nihilist</h3><p>One way to bring this out is to note that it seems totally possible to accept everything in the \u201cnatural world\u201d part of the diagram above, and to remain a nihilist. Thus:</p><blockquote><p><i>Meta-ethical hedonist</i>: \u201cDude, isn\u2019t it just <i>so true</i> that pleasure involves positive valence?\u201d</p><p><i>Nihilist</i>: \u201cOh yeah, no doubt. Possible that\u2019s true by definition or something.\u201d</p><p><i>Meta-ethical hedonist</i>: \u201cAnd like, don\u2019t you just <i>confront</i> pleasure\u2019s positive valence, when you experience pleasure?

All I said was that it <i>feels</i> good. When I said that it feels good, I meant to refer to a descriptive feature of the world, an \u2018is\u2019-feature. And I\u2019m happy to grant that I have some sort of especially-direct access to this sort of descriptive feature of the world. But by hypothesis, goodness construed as a non-natural, irreducibly normative property is something else entirely.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>That is, in the context of a non-naturalist meta-ethic, the meta-ethical hedonist risks equivocating between a <i>descriptive</i> understanding of the goodness of pleasure (i.e., the sense in which pleasure \u201cfeels good\u201d) and a normative understanding (i.e. the sense in which pleasure is to-be-promoted, an intrinsic source of practical reasons, and so on). No one denies (or at least, no one in this debate need deny) that pleasure feels good in the former sense. But the whole point of non-naturalism is that descriptive claims like \u201cpleasure feels good\u201d are <i>irreducibly different</i> from normative claims like \u201cpleasure is to-be-promoted\u201d \u2013 indeed, it\u2019s this irreducible difference that prompts the non-naturalist to posit a whole extra normative realm, on top of the natural world, to serve as the \u201cterritory\u201d for our normative \u201cmaps.\u201d And nothing has been said, yet, to give us access to this territory.</p><h3>3.4 Positing access to the non-natural normative realm?</h3><p>OK, but suppose we start trying to say such things.

Rather, we confront, directly, that extra, mysterious realm of what <i>should be</i>, the realm of <i>ought</i>, <i>must, value, reasons.</i> Pleasure\u2019s non-natural to-be-promoted-ness is presented to us the way that the brightness of phenomenal yellow is presented to us \u2013 not merely in a manner that prompts unusual confidence about it (Wendell, after all, might feel quite confident that Allan\u2019s violation of Phoebe\u2019s autonomy was wrong), but in a manner sufficiently \u201cunmediated\u201d as to leave no room for distinction between its being presented to us and its being the case, between its appearance and its reality.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefacekz1y6zcd\"><sup><a href=\"#fnacekz1y6zcd\">[22]</a></sup></span></p><p>I think that to the extent meta-ethical hedonists want to be non-naturalists, this is the version of the view they should go for. But now, note, we\u2019ve entered into more controversial and extravagant territory than we did when we posited that introspection gives you direct acquaintance with phenomenal properties. Admittedly, we didn\u2019t really know what we meant, when we posited this \u2013 unclarity that one worries is serving as a kind of \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps\">realism of gaps</a>,\u201d wherein the non-naturalist realist seizes on some especially obscure part of our epistemology and says \u201cthat super-obscure part is where the epistemic access to the non-natural normative realm happens\u201d (more on this in section 5). But even setting this unclarity aside: to the na\u00efve ear, \u201cintrospection gives us direct acquaintance with what it\u2019s like to be us\u201d sounds a lot more intuitively plausible than \u201cintrospection gives us direct acquaintance with non-natural, irreducibly normative properties, over and above what it\u2019s like to be us.\u201d</p><p>Granted the first, has the meta-ethical hedonist given us any reason to accept the second? One argument might be:</p><ol><li>Pleasure has the property of being good in a non-natural, irreducibly normative sense. &nbsp;</li><li>You have direct acquaintance with pleasure.</li><li>Direct acquaintance with pleasure involves direct acquaintance with all of pleasure\u2019s properties.</li><li>Thus, in being directly acquainted with pleasure, you are directly acquainted with its non-natural goodness.</li></ol><p>But where did we get premise 3? Maybe the thought is: pleasure is a phenomenal thing, so its properties are exhausted by its phenomenal presentation? But (on non-naturalism) pleasure\u2019s goodness <i>isn\u2019t</i> a phenomenal thing \u2013 rather, it\u2019s an irreducibly normative thing, supervening on a phenomenal thing. Maybe direct acquaintance gets us into contact with all the <i>phenomenal</i> properties of a phenomenal thing<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2qf2oj63zpq\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2qf2oj63zpq\">[23]</a></sup></span>\u2013 but why think it gets us to the normative properties floating, on top, in another realm?</p><p>Indeed, my sense is that the argument that actually drives (non-naturalist) meta-ethical hedonists is something more like:</p><ol><li>When I look at pleasure in my experience, I\u2019m like \u201cman, that is so good.\u201d</li><li>Also, when I look at phenomenal yellow in my experience, I\u2019m like \u201cman, that is so bright.\u201d</li><li>When I do this with phenomenal yellow, I\u2019m on uniquely solid ground, because I\u2019m in direct acquaintance with phenomenal yellow.</li><li>Also, when I do this with pleasure, I\u2019m in direct acquaintance with pleasure.</li><li>Thus, my judgment that pleasure is good is on the same, uniquely solid ground as my judgment that phenomenal yellow is bright.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvc9vsut5cwl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvc9vsut5cwl\">[24]</a></sup></span></li></ol><p>But even granted 1-4, 5 doesn\u2019t follow. In particular, we\u2019ve been assuming that the reason your judgment about the brightness of phenomenal yellow is on uniquely solid ground is that in being directly acquainted with phenomenal yellow, you\u2019re directly acquainted with its brightness as well. But, as before, the brightness of phenomenal yellow is a <i>phenomenal property</i>, whereas (by hypothesis, on non-naturalism) the goodness of pleasure is not. So the two judgments would only be on comparably solid ground if, in being directly acquainted with pleasure, you were also directly acquainted with the realm of irreducible normativity. And that\u2019s precisely the question at issue \u2013 a question that the meta-ethical hedonist has thus far not illuminated.</p><p>We can imagine generating other possible stories about direct acquaintance, for use in attempting to justify the claim that it lays bare not just the phenomenal domain but the extra, irreducibly normative domain as well. Indeed, much of <a href=\"https://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:603a9b3e-3f94-41bd-9715-1062d96384fd/download_file?file_format=application%2Fpdf&amp;safe_filename=Dissertation%2B-%2Bfinal.pdf&amp;type_of_work=Thesis\">Bastian Stern\u2019s dissertation</a> is devoted to generating, examining and shooting down various options in this vein. The need for \u201cgeneration,\u201d though, derives (at least as far as I can tell) from the comparative dearth of serious efforts, in this respect, on the part of meta-ethical hedonists themselves (the published defenses of something-like meta-ethical hedonism I\u2019ve seen are in a more naturalist meta-ethical vein). That is, many meta-ethical hedonists seem to assume that once they\u2019ve been granted direct acquaintance with phenomenal properties, they can get direct acquaintance with a distinct set of irreducibly normative properties as well, for free, without saying how and why the former extends to the latter, or giving much of a story of how direct acquaintance works more broadly. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s right.</p><p>Plus, even if we got ourselves into the idea of direct acquaintance as a source of access to the irreducibly normative domain, this idea would lead to the same problems we run into when we appeal to \u201crational intuition\u201d as a source of such access \u2013 except, without partners-in-guilt like math, philosophy, and general <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/analytic-synthetic/\">synthetic a priori reasoning</a> as comforts. Notably, for example (and even setting aside objections to do with the mysteriousness of the faculty and form of access at issue), we would be giving up on the causal (or at least, the explanatory) inertness of the irreducibly normative, and positing a source of explanation of our judgments not countenanced by science \u2013 a source which plausibly makes empirical predictions about the moral views of aliens, super-intelligent AI systems, and the like, and which needs to find some place amidst a physical world generally thought to be causally closed. If we\u2019re up for paying these sorts of costs, in the context of an otherwise mysterious epistemic faculty, then plausibly, we should be up for them in the context of rational intuition as well, in which case we can begin to diffuse the epistemic objection to non-naturalism without any special focus on direct acquaintance.</p><p>I\u2019ll have more to say about moves in this broad vein at the end of the essay. For now, let\u2019s move on to naturalist variants of meta-ethical hedonism.</p><h2>4. Meta-ethical hedonism for naturalists?</h2><p>Thus far I\u2019ve been focused on a version of meta-ethical hedonism that attempts to defend meta-ethical non-naturalism. But perhaps some meta-ethical hedonists out there have been frustrated: \u201cObviously, I never meant to claim something so metaphysically extravagant as non-naturalism in meta-ethics. No, no, my normative realism is quite scientifically respectable, I assure you.\u201d And indeed, various published views in the vicinity of meta-ethical hedonism \u2013 notably, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Value-Grounded-Phenomenal-Consciousness/dp/B0B986GNCM/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1LWEX0PIIU7BW&amp;keywords=the+feeling+of+value&amp;qid=1669413727&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=the+feeling+of+value%2Cstripbooks%2C137&amp;sr=1-1\">Rawlette (2016)</a> and <a href=\"https://www.hedweb.com/hedethic/hedon2.htm#value\">Pearce (1995)</a> \u2013 are in a more naturalist vein.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefx68f5b0qkw\"><sup><a href=\"#fnx68f5b0qkw\">[25]</a></sup></span></p><h3>4.1 Verbal disputes?</h3><p>I want to briefly discuss this version of meta-ethical hedonism, but I admit that I have less energy for it. This is partly because, as I mentioned above, I tend to see the distinction between non-naturalism and naturalism as more important than the distinctions between different naturalist meta-ethical views (e.g., naturalist realism vs. subjectivism vs. nihilism). In particular, I worry that the latter are often verbal. After all, the whole point of naturalism is that the world can be exhaustively described in purely non-normative terms. So then what are we arguing about, except the best way to use some additional set of terms \u2013 namely, the normative ones? What ultimately exists isn\u2019t at issue. We could <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WBdvyyHLdxZSAMmoz/taboo-your-words\">taboo</a> all the normative terms, without loss of any ability to describe the world accurately (though perhaps, with some loss of convenience).</p><p>Indeed, talking with the straw naturalist meta-ethical hedonist in my head, it can feel like the main thing they\u2019re telling me is \u201cno, really, there exists such a thing as positively valenced experience,\u201d and once I grant that, which I\u2019m fairly happy to do, I cease to have a clear grip on what we\u2019re arguing about. Did the nihilist ever need to disagree, for example, that positively valanced experience exists? Yet it can feel like my straw naturalist meta-ethical hedonist takes this fact to have disproven nihilism.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmclmibv56t\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmclmibv56t\">[26]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Maybe this is just what it feels like to be a naturalist about meta-ethics? I.e., if I stamp my foot hard enough about equating goodness with blah-natural-thing (e.g., positively valenced experience), it ceases to be possible to accept the existence of blah-natural-thing, but remain a nihilist? News to the nihilists, to be sure. Then again, the nihilists were always non-naturalists at heart, and someone has to be confused\u2026</p><h3>4.2 Is there any distinctive epistemic problem for naturalist realism?</h3><p>Beyond these worries about verbal disputes, though, there\u2019s another reason I\u2019m less interested in naturalist versions of meta-ethical hedonism: namely, objections to do with how we can get the right sort of epistemic access to normative properties seem much less pressing, conditional on naturalism about meta-ethics.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7gsz5e79kxs\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7gsz5e79kxs\">[27]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;After all, on naturalism, normative properties are natural properties, so our epistemic diagram (regardless of whether we\u2019re hedonists) looks more like:</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669941657/mirroredImages/7dGZnj7bwpM2kSJqm/hiy0fmcfeznbie4zuoev.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://jc.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-7.png 746w, https://jc.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-7-300x131.png 300w, https://jc.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-7-402x176.png 402w, https://jc.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-7-462x202.png 462w, https://jc.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-7-662x289.png 662w, https://jc.gatspress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/image-7-722x316.png 722w\"></p><p><i>Figure 6: The epistemic benefits of naturalism about meta-ethics</i></p><p>To flesh this out a bit more: many naturalist forms of moral realism rest heavily on a story about the <i>concept</i> of goodness.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreff2a3174kyu\"><sup><a href=\"#fnf2a3174kyu\">[28]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Thus, for example, the naturalist might claim that it is an <i>analytic truth</i>, akin to the truth that all bachelors are unmarried, that goodness is blah-natural-thing (for example, pleasure). That is, on this view, to say that something is good <i>just is</i> to say that it\u2019s pleasant. Goodness is pleasure because that\u2019s the <i>definition</i> of goodness.</p><p>Alternatively, the naturalist\u2019s conceptual story might pick out the set of natural properties identical with goodness in some more indirect way, by saying that goodness is identical with whatever natural property meets blah-conditions: for example, <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism-moral/#CornReal\">causally regulating our use of the term \u201cgood,\u201d</a> or <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism-moral/#JackMoraFunc\">playing blah-functional role in \u201cmature folk morality,\u201d</a> or <a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2021/06/21/on-the-limits-of-idealized-values\">being such that blah-people would have blah-attitudes towards it under blah-conditions</a>.</p><p>Either way, once the naturalist\u2019s conceptual story is in place, all the rest of the epistemic work, in figuring out which things are good, is of a quite familiar, empirical type. Thus, if goodness is pleasure by definition, then figuring out what\u2019s good just means: figuring out what\u2019s pleasant. Or if goodness is \u201cwhatever property causally regulates our use of the term \u2018good\u2019\u201d, we can get out there and try to figure out what that property is, and what has it, too. In both cases, we\u2019re in a vastly superior epistemic position than we were in, in the non-naturalist section above, when we thought that goodness was \u201cthat irreducibly extra property of to-be-promoted-ness, beyond the natural world, that supervenes on some stuff but not others.\u201d Back then, even after we knew what we were looking for (did we?), we had no clue how to find it. We kept scraping our fingers against the edges of the natural world, trying to detect the location of something beyond it \u2013 but we could never break through.</p><p>So at least compared to the non-naturalist, normative epistemology has never been the naturalist\u2019s main problem (rather, the naturalist\u2019s main problem has always been something like: normative properties seeming irreducibly different from natural properties). But this leaves meta-ethical hedonism, at least as I\u2019ve characterized it, with a much weaker motivation in a naturalist context. What is the epistemic problem that it solves for pleasure, but to which other candidate intrinsic values still fall prey? And what role does direct acquaintance have in the solution? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I\u2019m not sure. Indeed, my vague sense is that meta-ethical hedonists often want to be naturalists, but they don\u2019t necessarily want to offer a specific account of how their naturalism works \u2013 of what <i>makes it the case</i> that \u201cgoodness\u201d picks out one natural property vs. another.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2q11rp33aa9\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2q11rp33aa9\">[29]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;But this makes it hard to evaluate exactly what work a given appeal to direct acquaintance with the phenomenology of pleasure is supposed to do, but which our epistemic relationship to Allan\u2019s violation of Phoebe\u2019s autonomy can\u2019t do. Is direct acquaintance with the phenomenology of pleasure supposed to help us figure out the <i>definition</i> of goodness? Is it supposed to help us decide between different indirect ways \u201cgoodness\u201d might pick out a natural property as a referent \u2013 e.g., causal regulation, functional role in mature folk morality, etc? Is it supposed to help us in the empirical project of figuring out what those natural properties are (e.g., which natural properties causally regulate our use of the term \u201cgood\u201d), and which things have them?</p><p>Meta-ethical hedonists rarely say. And regardless, none of these options sound to me attractive. I won\u2019t, here, attempt to canvass all possible ways of pursuing them, but I will look at one of them \u2013 Rawlette\u2019s \u2013 in more depth, in an effort to illustrate what seems to me a broader barrier.</p><h3>4.3 Rawlette\u2019s view</h3><p>Of the published, naturalist views in the vicinity of meta-ethical hedonism, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Value-Grounded-Phenomenal-Consciousness/dp/B0B986GNCM/ref=sr_1_1?crid=1LWEX0PIIU7BW&amp;keywords=the+feeling+of+value&amp;qid=1669413727&amp;s=books&amp;sprefix=the+feeling+of+value%2Cstripbooks%2C137&amp;sr=1-1\">Rawlette (2016)</a> goes the furthest towards explaining the sort of naturalism she has in mind. Her view is a version of \u201cgoodness = pleasure by definition.\u201d In particular, she thinks that our concept of goodness (and indeed, of normativity more broadly) <i>comes from</i> the phenomenology of pleasure.</p><p>I\u2019m not sure exactly how Rawlette\u2019s theory of concept acquisition goes, but here\u2019s one attempt at reconstruction. First, you wake up in the world without the concept of goodness or normativity.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefu007u7ct5i\"><sup><a href=\"#fnu007u7ct5i\">[30]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Then you have that particular sort of raw phenomenology that experiences of stuff like hot baths, cookies, and sex have in common \u2013 phenomenology that, for Rawlette, does not itself involve anything being represented as good or normative (since you don\u2019t yet have a concept of goodness or normativity).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0dpuejrkqkjs\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0dpuejrkqkjs\">[31]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Then, you form some concept of this way of feeling, the same way you form a concept of phenomenal red when you <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_argument\">see it for the first time</a>. And, um, <i>that\u2019s</i> your concept of goodness. That is, goodness <i>just means</i> something like \u201cthat special way that pleasure feels.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4ks4zlqrnlq\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4ks4zlqrnlq\">[32]</a></sup></span></p><p>True, maybe you go around foolishly applying that concept (and concepts derived from it, like \u201cwrongness\u201d) to non-experiential stuff \u2013 e.g., <a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2021/02/14/contact-with-reality\">things that experience machines are missing</a>, Allan\u2019s violation of Phoebe\u2019s autonomy, etc. But that\u2019s because of mistakes involved in mis-associating your internal experiences of pleasure/pain phenomenology with the external world. I.e., in the same way you end up thinking that redness exists in external objects, rather than only in your mind, you end up thinking that \u201cthat special way that pleasure/pain feels\u201d exists in the external world (even apart from its existence in other minds), when in fact it does not.</p><p>Of course, this view requires biting various bullets. Notably, for example, you have to say (in the face of \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-question_argument#:\">open question</a>\u201d arguments to the contrary) that \u201cthis instance of pleasure is not even pro tanto good\u201d is literally <i>incoherent</i> \u2013 a view Rawlette defends in Chapter 4. And coming to think that \u201cthat special way that pleasure feels\u201d exists in external, unconscious objects is a strange mistake. Still, I think it\u2019s an interesting view in various ways, and worth consideration.</p><p>For present purposes, though, what matters is that once the full view is spelled out, we can see that its structure and motivation don\u2019t actually fit very well with meta-ethical hedonism as I\u2019ve characterized it.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefai41ydjpymn\"><sup><a href=\"#fnai41ydjpymn\">[33]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In particular, all the important work, in support of hedonism, is being done by Rawlette\u2019s story about the<i> definition</i> of goodness \u2013 a story that our direct acquaintance with the phenomenology of pleasure doesn\u2019t do much to help us assess. That is, Rawlette\u2019s argument is basically:</p><ol><li>There is a certain special way that pleasure feels, which you have direct acquaintance with.</li><li>Also, \u201cgoodness,\u201d by definition, is identical with this special way of feeling.</li></ol><p>And it\u2019s true that from this, you can get to hedonism \u2013 and indeed, to the claim that you have direct acquaintance with the goodness of pleasure (this, it turns out, is just a restatement of 1 \u2013 a way of saying that you\u2019re directly acquainted with the pleasantness of pleasure). But 2 is doing all the heavy lifting \u2013 and you don\u2019t have direct acquaintance with the truth of <i>that</i>.</p><p>Thus, imagine trying to use Rawlette\u2019s argument to persuade Wendell the witness that he should discard his intuition that Allan\u2019s autonomy violation was wrong, but keep his intuition that the pleasure of his hot bath was good.</p><blockquote><p><i>Wendell</i>: I have both of these intuitions pretty strongly. Why should I give up one, but not the other?</p><p><i>Hedonist</i>: You\u2019re <i>directly acquainted </i>with the pleasantness of your hot bath experience. But you\u2019re not directly acquainted with the autonomy violation \u2013 rather, it\u2019s out there in the external world.</p><p><i>Wendell</i>: OK, sure, but why does that matter?</p><p><i>Hedonist</i>: One more thing: goodness just <i>is</i> pleasantness, by definition.</p><p><i>Wendell</i>: Oh, huh. That doesn\u2019t <i>sound</i> right. Why would I think that?</p><p><i>Hedonist</i>: <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-question_argument#:\">Moore\u2019s open question argument</a> doesn\u2019t show that the claim I just made is false. Also, if we accept it, we have the makings of a form of moral realism that satisfies various nice criteria. I\u2019ll send you a PDF of Rawlette (2016), Chapter 4. &nbsp;</p><p><i>Wendell</i>: Wait, I thought you were going to make an argument in favor of keeping my pleasure intuition, but not my respecting-autonomy intuition, because direct acquaintance gives me special access to the truth of the one, but not the other. &nbsp;</p><p><i>Hedonist</i>: I am! You\u2019re directly acquainted with the goodness of pleasure, and in that sense directly acquainted with the truth of the claim that pleasure is good. But you\u2019re definitely not directly acquainted with the wrongness of the autonomy violation. Indeed, we know from the very definition of goodness that the autonomy violation was goodness-promoting (also, we\u2019re consequentialists, because reasons). &nbsp;</p><p><i>Wendell</i>: But how do I know that that\u2019s the right definition of goodness?</p><p><i>Hedonist</i>: Let me send you this PDF.</p><p><i>Wendell</i>: But is direct acquaintance going to give me access to the truth of the detailed philosophical claims in that PDF?</p><p><i>Hedonist</i>: Um\u2026 maybe it will make them seem plausible? Like, maybe you can look in your experience, check out what pleasure feels like, and then be like: \u201cyeah, my concept of goodness <i>just is</i> something like \u2018that special way pleasure feels\u2019; the raw, non-representational phenomenology of pleasure is the very source of my concept.\u201d</p><p><i>Wendell</i>: Hmm, that sounds like a pretty specific thesis about my concept acquisition, which seems hard to evaluate via introspection alone. And regardless, it doesn\u2019t sound like a phenomenal thing, and phenomenal things were the things I was ready to grant that I have direct acquaintance with.</p><p><i>Hedonist</i>: OK, but you do also have direct acquaintance with the goodness of pleasure.</p><p><i>Wendell</i>: <i>If</i> I accept your definition of goodness. In your language, you\u2019re basically just repeating the claim that I have direct acquaintance with the pleasantness of pleasure. &nbsp;</p><p><i>Hedonist</i>: Yes, that\u2019s right.</p></blockquote><p>That is, <i>if</i> you accept Rawlette\u2019s naturalist hedonism, then you get to the claim that you have direct acquaintance with the goodness of pleasure. But your direct acquaintance with your phenomenology does not, itself, give you much reason to accept Rawlette\u2019s hedonism.</p><h3>4.4 This problem generalizes</h3><p>Of course, Rawlette\u2019s is only one form of naturalist hedonism. But even without canvassing all of the other options, I expect this problem to generalize. That is, while it\u2019s possible to describe various forms of naturalistic, hedonistic moral realism on which we have direct acquaintance with the goodness of pleasure, it\u2019s a substantially further step to say that direct acquaintance with pleasure gives us any <i>reason</i> to accept such a view. And indeed, in general, direct acquaintance seems poorly suited to do the type of work that a naturalist realist needs to do, in arguing for one normative-ethical view over another. This work, after all, is either centrally conceptual (i.e., figuring out the true story about how the concept of goodness picks out its referent) or empirical (figuring out which stuff has what natural properties) \u2013 and by granting that we have direct acquaintance with our <i>phenomenology</i>, we have not granted that we have direct acquaintance to the relevant truths in these conceptual or empirical domains.</p><p>Indeed, in a sense, the naturalist\u2019s problem, here, is the same problem that the non-naturalist had in section 3. In both cases, we granted direct acquaintance with the pleasantness of pleasure. In both cases, though, what was needed was an argument for some specific connection <i>between</i> pleasure and goodness (in the case of non-naturalism: supervenience; and in the case of naturalism: identity). And in neither case did direct acquaintance give us epistemic access to a connection of this form (even if we can argue for such a connection on other grounds).</p><h2><strong>5. The mystery view</strong></h2><p>This hasn\u2019t been an exhaustive survey of all the ways you might try to get some form of meta-ethical hedonism going. But I hope that the basic challenge is fairly clear. Ultimately, from the perspective of normative epistemology, positing direct acquaintance with phenomenal states changes little \u2013 at least on its own. All it gives you is a (mysterious) form of epistemic access to a certain bit of the natural world \u2013 a certain bit of the \u201cis.\u201d But figuring out what\u2019s up with the \u201cought\u201d remains as hard as it ever was \u2013 and in the case of non-naturalism: too hard.</p><p>Perhaps we might wonder, though: what explains the prima facie appeal of meta-ethical hedonism, if it\u2019s such a non-game-changer? Well, at least to a certain type of a person, I\u2019m not actually sure the view <i>has</i> much prima facie appeal. That is, a certain type of meta-ethicist, attuned to the \u201cis-ought\u201d gap, will be immediately pessimistic that this gap can be crossed or dissolved via our epistemic access to our phenomenology. The question was never whether pleasure is pleasant.</p><p>To the extent meta-ethical hedonism does have prima facie appeal, though, I think that part of it comes from the fact that our intuitions about the goodness of pleasure are, indeed, unusually strong and hard-to-doubt; that those intuitions are <i>formed</i> in response to introspection on the pleasantness of pleasure; and that it is indeed intuitive that our epistemic access to the pleasantness of pleasure is in some sense uniquely direct. So it\u2019s easy to smoosh it all together and to say that you\u2019re getting the same sort of epistemic access to pleasure\u2019s goodness that you\u2019re getting to pleasure\u2019s pleasantness \u2013 especially if you\u2019re up for equivocating between the descriptive sense in which pleasure is good (i.e., it feels good) and the normative sense (i.e., it\u2019s to-be-promoted), and/or saying that these two senses are the same due to the truth of a naturalist hedonism that it\u2019s easy to forget you\u2019re supposed to be in the midst of justifying.</p><p>But I think there\u2019s another source of appeal as well, which I don\u2019t think is wholly misguided.</p><p>Above I mentioned a worry about a \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_of_the_gaps\">normative realism of the gaps</a>.\u201d On this worry, the (non-naturalist) normative realist, scrambling to find some way of holding on to non-natural, causally-inert, somehow-known-about normative properties in the face of an otherwise naturalistic world picture, seizes on the aspects of that picture that remain most confusing and/or incomplete, and tries to use then as a wedge to make room for realism. Thus, perhaps: \u201cConsciousness! It\u2019s still super confusing and seems pretty different from other physical stuff. And we\u2019ve got some kind of confusing and different form of epistemic access to it? Thus, maybe, that\u2019s where the normative realism thing happens too?\u201d</p><p>In a bad form, this sort of reasoning serves to merely multiply confusions. Here I\u2019m reminded of cases in which someone groping for a theory of consciousness decides to appeal to quantum mechanics, despite not really understanding how quantum mechanics works (in certain sorts of conversations, if someone says the word \u201cquantum,\u201d you can tell things are heading downhill).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1aqf3hy6mmei\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1aqf3hy6mmei\">[34]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Mixing not-understood-thing A with not-understood-thing B rarely leads to additional clarity. And to the extent one is attached to A (in this case, non-natural normativity), one might then end up unduly motivated to <i>keep</i> B (in this case, consciousness) not-understood, in the same way God-of-the-gaps theists can end up unduly motivated to resist the onward march of science.</p><p>Then why is such a mixing-together so tempting? <a href=\"https://consc.net/papers/facing.html\">Chalmers (1995)</a> suggests \u201cthe Law of Minimization of Mystery: consciousness is mysterious and quantum mechanics is mysterious, so maybe the two mysteries have a common source.\u201d But as the example of consciousness and quantum mechanics makes clear: sometimes two things are mysterious <i>and also still very different from each other</i>. Thus, as Chalmers notes, quantum mechanics does not, itself, offer any additional resources for crossing the \u201cexplanatory gap\u201d between the physical/functional and the phenomenal \u2013 the gap that makes consciousness mysterious in the first place.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefuey4e4ti57q\"><sup><a href=\"#fnuey4e4ti57q\">[35]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;And in a sense, the realist who seeks after normativity in the realm of the phenomenal runs into a similar problem. Maybe the normative and the phenomenal are both different from the physical \u2013 <i>but they\u2019re different from each other as well</i>. So positing blah type of epistemic access to the latter leaves the former untouched. The relevant gap (this time: is vs. ought, rather than functional vs. phenomenal) has not been crossed.</p><p>That said, I don\u2019t think an interest in connections between normative epistemology and the epistemology of (phenomenal) consciousness is wholly misguided. In particular (and in disanalogy with connections between quantum mechanics and consciousness), both non-naturalists about normativity and dualists about consciousness face a structurally similar epistemic objection. Both of them posit something that floats above the physical world, and hence outside the network of physical causes that usually give us knowledge about stuff. And in both cases, this leaves it worryingly unclear how we could ever get epistemic access to the existence or the distribution of the relevant floating stuff. Naively, that is, one expects to end up saying \u201cI am conscious,\u201d with your physical mouth, <i>because</i> you are conscious; and to end up saying \u201cpleasure is good,\u201d with your physical mouth, <i>because</i> pleasure is good. But it doesn\u2019t sound like you do, if consciousness and goodness are outside the normal nexus of physical causes that generate your mouth movements \u2013 and thus, it doesn\u2019t sound like the consciousness/normativity utterances produced by your mouth would be reliable indicators of the things they\u2019re supposed to be about. I wrote about this objection in the context of non-natural normativity <a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2022/01/17/the-ignorance-of-normative-realism-bot\">here</a>. For discussion of it in the context of dualism about consciousness, see e.g. <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7DmA3yWwa6AT5jFXt/zombies-redacted\">Yudkowsky (2016)</a>, and <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/archive/CHATMO-32.pdf\">Chalmers (2018)</a> on \u201cthe coincidence problem.\u201d</p><p>One option, here, is to become a reductionist about <i>both </i>normativity <i>and</i> consciousness. And indeed, I think that\u2019s probably the way to go. But many people, including me, have a harder time being reductionists about consciousness (for example, reductionism about consciousness can lead to <a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2020/11/29/grokking-illusionism\">illusionism</a> in the same way that reductionism about normativity can lead to nihilism, but most people just aren\u2019t up for illusionism \u2013 and I don\u2019t blame them). To the extent they try to hold on to a non-reductionist theory of consciousness, then, while <i>also</i> holding on to the idea that you say that you\u2019re conscious <i>because you\u2019re conscious</i>, they are implicitly assuming some kind of funky set-up where the non-physical consciousness stuff still explains your mouth movements despite its wholly-non-physical character. That is, they\u2019re implicitly assuming some answer to the epistemic problem for dualism about consciousness \u2013 even if they can\u2019t say exactly what it is. But if we have an answer like that, then it seems very non-crazy to wonder whether it might apply to the epistemic problem for non-natural normativity as well, given the structure similarities at stake (see <a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2022/01/17/the-ignorance-of-normative-realism-bot#vi-how-to-be-a-normative-realist\">here</a> for a description of what that might look like) \u2013 and thus, to wonder whether the two non-reductionisms might stand (rather than fall) together.</p><p>In my head, I call this view \u201cthe mystery view,\u201d due to its appealing to a mysterious answer to the epistemic objections in question, and to a broader connection with vibes about philosophical humility, noticing when you\u2019re still confused, and not-discarding-important-stuff just because it feels clever. At some point, I\u2019m hoping to write more about the strengths and weaknesses of the mystery view as I see it (it\u2019s my main meta-ethical alternative to a more reductionist naturalism/anti-realism/subjectivism).</p><p>For now, though, the main thing I want to note is that while the mystery view bears some superficial resemblance to meta-ethical hedonism (both are interested in connections between the epistemology of consciousness and the epistemology of normativity), they\u2019re actually quite different, and I don\u2019t think the mystery view does much to support hedonism.</p><p>In particular, even while the mystery view draws support for non-naturalist realism from consciousness as a partner-in-guilt, it <i>also</i> draws support from a variety of additional domains/partners-in-guilt \u2013 notably, mathematics and synthetic a priori reasoning more generally \u2013 in which somewhat similar epistemic problems arise. In this sense, it makes room for the relevant solution to these problems (to the extent there is a unified, non-reductionist solution) to apply beyond the realm of the phenomenal. Maybe, in some sense, it ends up being the \u201csame faculty\u201d (something something rational intuition?) that accesses the normative facts, the phenomenal facts, the mathematical facts, the synthetic a priori facts, and so on \u2013 or maybe not. But regardless, my best-guess is that phenomenal stuff doesn\u2019t end up privileged, and so \u201cpleasure is good\u201d doesn\u2019t end up privileged, either, relative to other intuitions like \u201cAllan\u2019s violation of Phoebe\u2019s autonomy was wrong.\u201d</p><p>Put another way, and even regardless of whether further domains like math and a priori reasoning get included: the mystery view notices a structural similarity between the \u201cways of knowing\u201d required for different non-reductionist views to withstand epistemic critique, and so suggests that maybe this way of knowing is possible even if we don\u2019t have a good story for how it works. But it doesn\u2019t say much about the <i>content</i> of what gets to be known, in those different domains \u2013 rather, it just says that knowledge, in all of them, is possible. Whereas meta-ethical hedonism says, specifically, that it\u2019s only with respect to phenomenal stuff that normative knowledge is possible.</p><p>Beyond this, though, in my head there\u2019s a broader difference in vibe between the mystery view and meta-ethical hedonism. In my head, the mystery view is trying, in a sense, to do <i>less</i> philosophy \u2013 to hold onto some basic, important-seeming stuff, even if we don\u2019t have a super clear story about how, lest we become too-clever-by-half, and lose something precious in the process. Whereas meta-ethical hedonism, in my head, is trying to do <i>more</i> philosophy \u2013 to tell a very specific story about a specific domain (the phenomenal) in which we\u2019re allowed to have normative knowledge, and thus to fit our minds and our ethics to a more procrustean bed. That is, meta-ethical hedonism feels like it\u2019s missing some element of the humility thing I mentioned above (even if its otherwise humble about e.g. our understanding of phenomenal consciousness). But I\u2019ll leave explaining and justifying this \u201chumility thing\u201d for another time.</p><p>In closing, and regardless of how we feel about the mystery view: I think the hedonists should be humbler than meta-ethical hedonism tries to leave them. Indeed, I wrote this post partly because I have a sense that some hedonist normative realists, upon encounter with the epistemic objections to normative realism, have some inner sense that \u201cthose don\u2019t apply to me, because I get my normative knowledge from a special source \u2013 namely, direct acquaintance.\u201d Indeed, I worry that they emerge from this encounter bolstered in their confidence in hedonism, by a perception of having survived an assault to which the non-hedonists succumb. I think they\u2019re wrong about this: they\u2019re in the same meta-ethical boat as the rest of us.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnmrgv3dh9klm\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefmrgv3dh9klm\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>For convenience, I\u2019ll focus on the value of pleasure going forward.

Indeed, I\u2019ve wondered how much of the amorphous meta-ethical hedonism pervading various of my social circles comes from Pearce (or perhaps, from some other originator-who-influenced-Pearce; perhaps one popular on the <a href=\"https://felicifia.github.io/forum/index.html\">Felicifia</a> forum back in the day \u2013 so much of contemporary discourse in effective altruism, rationalism, transhumanism, etc originated on old forums, mailing lists, and so on: do not underestimate).

Most fundamentally, it might be seen as a relation between a subject and an instance of a property: I am most directly acquainted with this instance of phenomenal greenness. This acquaintance with an instance can then be seen to confer a derivative relation to the property itself. Or, in the experience-based framework, one might regard acquaintance as most fundamentally a relation between a subject and an experience that confers a derivative relation between the subject and the phenomenal properties of the experience. I will usually abstract away from these fine details, however. What is central is the shared feature that whenever a subject has a phenomenal property, the subject is acquainted with that phenomenal property.\u201d</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnwupe4gh8j5\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefwupe4gh8j5\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>From the <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/knowledge-acquaindescrip/#ConVieAcq\">SEP</a>: \u201cAcquaintance is typically taken to be simple and thus indefinable.

The implication of ARPA-E funding \"white space,\" is that ARPA-E funds projects that counterfactually would not have been funded. Support for this claim can be found&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sci-hub.se/10.1038/s41560-020-00683-8\"><u>here</u></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nap.nationalacademies.org/read/24811/chapter/2\"><u>here</u></a>.&nbsp;However, in reality, we think many of these technologies would be developed at&nbsp;<i>some point&nbsp;</i>-- ARPA-E simply speeds up the development. Thus, we believe that, all else equal, this first assumption leads to an overestimation of benefits. Future work could take advantage of other DOE BCR calculations that accounted for this consideration (links&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/downloads/benefit-cost-evaluation-us-department-energy-investment-hvac-water-heating\"><u>here</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/1339344\"><u>here</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2015/05/f22/geothermal12.01.11_0.pdf\"><u>here</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2014/01/f7/solar_pv.pdf\"><u>here</u></a>).&nbsp;</li><li>Secondly, we assume that all benefits -- including health benefits, reduction of monetary costs associated with climate change, reduction of existential risk associated with climate change, and spillover benefits into other industries -- are incorporated into the market valuation. We believe that markets likely price in the aforementioned externalities (e.g., health and enviro benefits) (support for this claim <a href=\"https://jpm.pm-research.com/content/47/9/35.abstract\"><u>here</u></a>).

This is a form of cognitive dissonance that can manifest itself in a number of ways, including (I submit) flirts with Machiavellian attitudes towards ethics. And this is not good. To explain this, I first need to lay some groundwork about normative ethics.</p><h2>Virtue Ethics vs. Deontology vs. Consequentialism</h2><h3>Yet Another Absurdly Brief Introduction to Normative Ethics (YAABINE)</h3><p>The LW/EA forums are littered with introductions, of varying quality and detail, to the three major families of normative ethical theories. <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JvXNCc6w58iHTYHuz/deontology-and-virtue-ethics-as-effective-theories-of\">Here</a> is one from only two weeks ago. As such, my rendition of YAABINE will be even briefer than usual, and focuses only on theories of right action. (I encourage checking out the real deal though: here are SEP's entries on <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/\">virtue ethics</a>, <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/\">deontology </a>and <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism/\">consequentialism</a>).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Virtue Ethics (VE):</strong> the rightness and wrongness of actions are judged by the character traits at the source of the action. If an action \"flows\" from a virtue, it is right; from a vice, wrong. The psychological setup (e.g. motivation) of the agent is thus critical for assessing right and wrong. Notably, the correct psychological setup often involves <i>not excessively reasoning</i>: VE is not necessarily inclined towards rationalism. (Much more on this below).</p><p><strong>Deonotological Ethics (DE): </strong>the rightness and wrongness of actions are judged by their accordance with the duties/rules/imperatives that apply to the agent. The most well known form of DE is Kantian Ethics (KE). Something I have yet to see mentioned on LW is that, for Kant, it's not enough to act merely <i>in accordance </i>with moral imperatives: one's actions must also result from <i>sound moral reasoning </i>about the imperatives that apply. KE, unlike VE, is very much a rationalist ethics.</p><p><strong>Consequentialism: </strong>the rightness and wrongness of actions are judged solely by their consequences \u2013 their net effect on the amount of value in the world. What that value is, where it is, whether we're talking about expected or actual effects, direct or indirect &nbsp;\u2013 these are all choice points for theorists. As very well put by <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yppdL4EXLWda5Wthn/deontology-for-consequentialists\">Alicorn</a>:</p><blockquote><p>\"Classic utilitarianism\" could go by the longer, more descriptive name \"actual direct maximizing aggregative total universal equal-consideration agent-neutral hedonic act consequentialism\".</p></blockquote><p>Finally, a quick word on theories of intrinsic value (goodness) and how they relate to theories of right action (rightness): conceptually speaking, much recombination is possible. For example, you could explain <i>both </i>goodness and rightness in terms of the virtues, forming a sort of Fundamentalist VE. Or you could explain goodness in terms of human flourishing (<i>eudaimonia</i>), which you in turn use to explain a virtue ethical theory of rightness \u2013 by arguing that human excellence (virtue) is partially constitutive of human flourishing. That would form a Eudaimonic VE (a.k.a. Neo-Aristotelian VE). Note that under this theory, a world with maximal human flourishing is judged to be maximally good, but the rightness and wrongness of our actions are not judged based on whether they maximize human flourishing!</p><p>Those are standard combinations but, <i>prima facie, </i>there is nothing conceptually incoherent about unorthodox recombinations like a Hedonistic VE (goodness = pleasure, and having virtues is necessary for/constitutive of pleasure), or Eudaimonic Consequentialism (goodness = <i>eudaimonia</i>, and rightness = actions that maximize general <i>eudaimonia</i>). The number of possible positions further balloons as you distinguish more phenomena and try to relate them together. There are, for example, many <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/value-theory/#BasQue\">different readings of \"good\"</a> and different categories of judgement (e.g. judging whole lives vs states of affairs at given moments in time; judging public/corporate policies vs character traits of individuals; judging any event vs specifically human actions). The normative universe is vast, and things can get complicated fast.</p><p>Here I hope to keep things contained to a discussion of right action, but just remember: this only scratches the surface!</p><h3>LW and EA, echo chambers for Consequentialism</h3><p>Why bother with YAABINE?<i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>Something nags me about previous introductions on the LW/EA forums: VE and DE are nearly always reinterpreted to fit within a consequentialist's worldview. This is unsurprising of course: both LW and EA were founded by consequentialists and have retained their imprint. But that also means these forums are turning into something of an echo chamber on the topic (or so I fear). With this post, I explicitly intend to challenge my consequentialist readers. I'm going to try and do for VE what <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yppdL4EXLWda5Wthn/deontology-for-consequentialists\">Alicorn does for DE</a>: demonstrate how virtue ethicists would actually think through a case.</p><p>What does that consequentialist co-opting look like? A number have remarked that, <i>on consequentialist grounds</i>, it is generally right to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZLBtZqsP79Cwioi2b/virtue-ethics-for-consequentialists\">operate as if</a> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZYADHcQFXwwsaqrMq/virtue-ethics-and-why-the-rationalist-community-might-care\">VE were true</a> (i.e. develop virtuous character traits) or <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/K9ZaZXDnL3SEmYZqB/ends-don-t-justify-means-among-humans#\">operate as if DE (if not KE) were true</a> (i.e. beware means-ends reasoning, respect more general rules and duties) or <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JvXNCc6w58iHTYHuz/deontology-and-virtue-ethics-as-effective-theories-of#Consequentialism\">a mix </a><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WdeiPrwgqW2wHAxgT/a-personal-statement-on-ftx\">of both</a>. In fact the second suggestion has a long heritage: this is basically just <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism-rule/\">Rule Consequentialism.</a></p><p>On the assumption that Consequentialism is true, I generally agree with these remarks. But let's get something straight: you shouldn't read these as <i>charitable interpretations of DE and VE </i>or something. There are very real differences and disagreements between the three major families of theory, and it's an open question regarding who is right. FWIW currently VE has <a href=\"https://survey2020.philpeople.org/survey/results/4890\">a slim plurality </a>among philosophers, with DE as the runner up. Among ethicists (applied, normative, meta, feminist), it seems DE consistently <a href=\"https://survey2020.philpeople.org/survey/results/4890?aos=30\">has the plurality</a>, with VE as runner up. Consequentialism is consistently in third place.</p><p>One way to think of the disagreement between the three families is in what facts they take to be <i>explanatorily fundamental </i>\u2013 the facts that form the basis for their unifying account of a whole range of normative judgments. Regarding judgments of actions, for DE the fundamental facts are about imperatives; for Consequentialism, consequences; for VE, the character of the agent. Every theory will have <i>something </i>to say about each of these terms \u2013 but different theories will take different terms to be fundamental. If it helps, you can <i>roughly </i>categorize these facts based on their location in the causal stream:</p><blockquote><p>DE <i>ultimately </i>judges actions based on facts causally up-stream from the action (e.g. what promises were made?), along with, perhaps, some acausal facts (e.g. what imperatives are analytically possible/impossible for a mind to will coherently?);&nbsp;</p><p>VE <i>ultimately </i>judges actions based on facts <i>immediately </i>up-stream (e.g. what psychological facts about the agent explain how they reacted to the situation at hand?);&nbsp;</p><p>Consequentialism <i>ultimately </i>judges actions based on down-stream facts (e.g. what was the net effect on utility?).</p></blockquote><p>This is an excessively simplistic and imperfect categorization, but hopefully it gets across the deeper disagreement between the families. Yes, it's true, they tend to prescribe the same course of action in many scenarios, but they very much disagree on <i>why </i>and <i>how </i>we should pursue said course. And that matters. Such is the disagreement at the heart of this post.</p><h2>The problem of thoughts too many</h2><p>Bernard Williams, 20th century philosopher and long-time critic of utilitarianism, proposed the following thought experiment. Suppose you come across two people drowning. As you approach you notice: one is a stranger; the other, your spouse! You only have time to save one of them: who do you save? Repressing any gut impulse they might have, the well-trained utilitarian will at this point calculate (or recall past calculations of) the net effect on utility for each choice, based on their preferred form of utilitarianism and... they will have already failed to live up to the moment. According to Williams, someone who seeks a theoretical justification for the impulse to save the life of a loved one has had \"one thought too many.\" (Cf. <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/waF2Pomid7YHjfEDt/p/xiHy3kFni8nsxfdcP\">this story about saving two children from an oncoming train</a>: EY is very much giving a calculated justification for an impulse that <i>only an over-thinking consequentialist would question</i>).</p><p>Virtue ethicist Michael Stocker<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref988y21o8ml9\"><sup><a href=\"#fn988y21o8ml9\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;develops a similar story, asking us to imagine visiting a sick friend at the hospital. If our <i>motivation </i>for visiting our sick friend is that we think doing so will maximize the general good, (or best obeys the rules most conducive to the general good, or best respects our duties), then we are <i>morally ugly </i>in some way. If the roles were reversed, it would likely hurt to find out our friend came to visit us <i>not </i>because they <i>care about us </i>(because they felt a pit in their stomach when they heard we were<i> </i>hospitalized) but because <i>they believe they are morally obligated </i>(they consulted moral theory, reasoned about the facts, and determined this was so)<i>. </i>Here, as before, there seems to be too much thinking getting in the way of (or even replacing) the correct <i>motivation </i>for acting as one should.</p><p>Note how anti<i>-</i>rationalist this is: part of the point here is that <i>the thinking itself can be ugly</i>. According to VE, in both these stories there should be little to no \"slow thinking\" going on at all \u2013 it is right for your \"fast thinking,\" your heuristics, to take the reins. Many virtue ethicists liken becoming virtuous to training one's moral vision \u2013 learning to <i>perceive </i>an action as right, not to <i>reason </i>that it is right. Of course cold calculated reasoning has its place, and many situations call for it. But there are many more in which being calculating is wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>(If your heuristic is a consciously invoked utilitarian/deontological rule that you've passionately pledged yourself to, then the ugliness comes from the fact that your affect is misplaced \u2013 you care about the rule, when you should be caring about your friend. Just like cold reasoning, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YhYfoGyXFbK9epxLG/sbf-s-comments-on-ethics-are-no-surprise-to-virtue-ethicists?commentId=AM4q6iFKaaLeiXamW\">impassioned respect for procedure and duty can be appropriate at times</a>; most times it amounts to obstinate rule-worship.)</p><h3>Internal Moral Disharmony</h3><p>In Stocker's terms, a theory brings on \"moral schizophrenia\" when it produces disharmony between our <i>reasons/justifications </i>for acting and our <i>motivations </i>to act. Since this term is outdated and misleading, let's call this malady of the spirit \"internal moral disharmony.\" As Stocker describes it (p454):</p><blockquote><p>An extreme form of [this disharmony] is characterized, on the one hand, by being moved to do what one believes bad, harmful, ugly, abasing; on the other, by being disgusted, horrified, dismayed by what one wants to do. Perhaps such cases are rare. But a more modest [disharmony] between reason and motive is not, as can be seen in many examples of weakness of the will, indecisiveness, guilt, shame, self-deception, rationalization, and annoyance with oneself.</p></blockquote><p>When our reasons (or love of rules) fully displace the <i>right </i>motivations to act, the disharmony is resolved but we get the aforementioned ugliness (in consequentialist terms: we do our friend/spouse harm by not actually caring about them). We become walking utility calculators (or rule-worshipers). Most of us, I would guess, are not so far gone, but instead struggle with this disharmony. It manifests itself as a sort of cognitive dissonance: we initially have the correct motivations to act, but thoughts too many get in the way, thoughts we would prefer <i>not </i>to have. Stocker's claim is that <i>Consequentialism is prone to producing this disharmony</i>. Consequentialism has us get <i>too </i>accustomed to ethical analysis, to the point of it <i>running counter </i>our first (and good) impulses, causing us to engage in slow thinking automatically <i>even when we would rather not</i>. Resolving this dissonance is difficult \u2013 like trying to stop thinking about pink elephants. The fact we have this dissonance in our head makes us less than a paragon of virtue, but better than the walking utility calculator/rule-worshiper.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides being a flaw in our moral integrity, this dissonance is also harmful to <i>ourselves</i>. (Which seems to lead <i>hedonistic </i>consequentialists to conclude we <i>should </i>be the walking utility calculators/rule-worshipers!<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9bmhwck254\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9bmhwck254\">[2]</a></sup></span>) Too much thinking about a choice \u2013 analyzing the options along more dimensions, weighing more considerations for and against each, increasing the number of options considered \u2013 will dampen one's emotional attachment to the option chosen. Most of us have felt this before: too much back and forth on what to order at a restaurant leaves you less satisfied with whatever you eventually choose. Too much discussion about where to go, what to do, leaves everyone less satisfied with whatever is finally chosen. A number of publications in psychology confirm and elaborate on this readily apparent phenomenon (most famously Schwartz's <i>The Paradox of Choice</i>).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbhd4u0w952a\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbhd4u0w952a\">[3]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefour6w9wpisn\"><sup><a href=\"#fnour6w9wpisn\">[4]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjzimugb7aw\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjzimugb7aw\">[5]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmi2jk5xqn3l\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmi2jk5xqn3l\">[6]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefq1rdihj17do\"><sup><a href=\"#fnq1rdihj17do\">[7]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefg3v0wn4usk9\"><sup><a href=\"#fng3v0wn4usk9\">[8]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7ocg3ava4g2\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7ocg3ava4g2\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(Credit for this list of references goes to Eva Illouz, who finds evidence of this phenomenon in the way we choose our romantic partners today, especially men).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbqepbupc3jm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbqepbupc3jm\">[10]</a></sup></span></p><p>Regularly applying ethical analysis to every little thing (which consequentialists are prone to do!) can be especially bad and dangerous. When ethical considerations and choices start to leave you cold, you will struggle to find the motivation to do what you judge is right,<i> </i>making you weak-willed (a \"less effective consequentialist\" if you prefer).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftd49decg34\"><sup><a href=\"#fntd49decg34\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Or you might continue to go through the right motions, but it will be mechanical, without joy or passion or fulfillment. This is harm in itself, to oneself. But moreover, it leaves you vulnerable: this coldness is a short distance from the frozen wastes of cynicism and nihilism. When ethics looks like \"just an optimization problem\" to you, it can quickly start to look like \"just a game.\" Making careful analysis your first instinct means learning to repress your <i>gut </i>sense of what is right and wrong; once you do that, right and wrong might start to <i>feel less important</i>, at which point it becomes harder to hang onto the normative reality they structure. You might continue to nominally recognize what is right and wrong, but feel no strong allegiance to rightness.</p><p>Given his penchant for consequentialist reasoning (and given that being colder is associated with being less risk-averse, making one a riskier gambler and more successful investor),<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpei61qxlc5n\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpei61qxlc5n\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;it would not surprise me to learn that SBF has slipped into that coldness at times. <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/08/15/the-reluctant-prophet-of-effective-altruism\">This profile piece</a> suggests Will McAskill has felt its touch. J.S. Mill, notable consequentialist, <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/10378/pg10378-images.html#link2HCH0005\">definitely suffered it</a>. There are symptoms of it <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/y5jAuKqkShdjMNZab/morality-is-scary\">all over this post </a>from Wei Dai <i>and </i>the ensuing comment thread (see my pushback <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/y5jAuKqkShdjMNZab/morality-is-scary?commentId=5CYxoHcfaGHeD68uC\">here</a>). In effect, much of EY's <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/rationality\">sequence on morality </a>encourages one to suppress affect and become a walking utility calculator or rule-worshiper (whether he intends this or not) \u2013 exactly what leads to this coldness. In short, I fear it is widespread in this community.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>EDIT: The term\"widespread\" is vague \u2013 I should have been clearer. <strong>I do not suspect this coldness afflicts the majority of LW/EA people.</strong>&nbsp;Something more in the neighborhood of 20~5%. Since it's not easy to measure this coldness, I have given a more concrete falsifiable prediction </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/FydrC9mQgh8YdNTQN/sbf-s-comments-on-ethics-are-no-surprise-to-virtue-ethicists?commentId=asgTt48v5e9R68GNN\"><i>here</i></a><i>. <strong>None of this is to say that, on net, the LW/EA community has a negative impact on people's moral character</strong>. On the contrary, on net, I'm sure it's positive. But if there is a problematic trend in the community (and if it had any role to play in the attitudes of certain high profile EAs towards ethics), I would hope the community takes steps to curb that trend.</i></p></blockquote><p>The danger of overthinking things is of course general, with those who are \"brainier\" being especially susceptible. Given that this is a rationalist community \u2013 a community that encourages braininess \u2013 it would be no surprise to find it here at higher rates than the general population. However, I <i>am </i>surprised and disappointed that <i>being brainy </i>hasn't been more visibly flagged as a risk factor! Let it be known: <i>braininess comes with its own hazards </i>(e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/GSqFqc646rsRd2oyz/p/SFZoEBpLo9frSJGkc\">rationalization</a>). This coldness is another one of them. LW should come with a warning label on it!</p><h3>A problem for everybody...</h3><p>If overthinking things is a very general problem, that suggests thoughts too many (roughly, \"the tendency to overthink things in ethical situations\") is also general and not specific to Consequentialism. And indeed, <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/#ObjeVirtEthi\">VE can suffer it</a>. In its simplest articulation, VE tells us to \"do as the virtuous agent would do,\" but telling your sick friend that you came to visit \"because this is what the virtuous agent would do\" is no better than the consequentialists response! You should visit your friend <i>because you're worried for them, full stop.</i> Similarly, if someone was truly brave and truly loved their spouse, they would dive in to save them from drowning (instead of the stranger) <i>without second thought</i>.</p><p>Roughly, a theory is said to be <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-theory/#DeciProcPracDeli\"><i>self-effacing</i></a><i> </i>when the <i>justification </i>it provides for the rightness of an action is also recognized by the theory as being the <i>wrong motivation </i>for taking that action. Arguably, theories can avoid causing internal disharmony at the cost of being self-effacing. When Stocker first exposed self-effacement in Consequentialism and DE, it was viewed as something of a bug. But in some sense, it might actually be a feature: if there is <i>no </i>situation in which your theory recommends you <i>stop consulting theory</i>, then there is something wrong with that theory \u2013 it is not accounting for the realities of human psychology and the wrongness of thoughts too many. It's unsurprising that self-effacement should show up in nearly every plausible <i>theory </i>of normative ethics \u2013 because <i>theory</i> tends to involve a lot of thinking.</p><h3>...but especially (casual) consequentialists.</h3><p>All that said, consequentialists should to be especially wary of developing thoughts too many for a few reasons:</p><ol><li>Culture: the culture <i>surrounding </i>Consequentialism is very much one that encourages adopting the mindset of a maximizer, an optimizing number cruncher, someone who applies decision theory to every aspect of one's life. Consequentialism and rationalism share a close history after all. In all things morality related, I advise rationalists tone down these attitudes (or at least flag them as hazardous) especially around less sophisticated, more casual audiences.</li><li>The theory's core message: even though <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/consequentialism-rule/#FulVerParRulCon\">most consequentialist philosophers advise <i>against</i> using an act-consequentialist decision procedure</a>, Act Consequentialism (\"the right action = the action which results in the most good\") is still the slogan. Analyzing, calculating, optimizing and maximizing appears <i>front and center </i>in the theory. It seems to encourage the culture mentioned above <i>from the outset</i>. It's only many observations later that <i>sophisticated </i>consequentialists will note that, the best way for humans to <i>actually </i>maximize utility is to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZYADHcQFXwwsaqrMq/virtue-ethics-and-why-the-rationalist-community-might-care\">operate as if VE </a>or <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/K9ZaZXDnL3SEmYZqB/ends-don-t-justify-means-among-humans#\">DE were true</a> (i.e. by developing character traits or respecting rules that tend to maximize utility). Fewer still notice the ugliness of thoughts too many (and rule-worship). Advocates of Consequentialism should do two things to guard their converts against, if nothing else, the cognitive dissonance of internal moral disharmony:<ol><li>At a minimum, converts should be made aware of the <i>facts about human psychology </i>(see \u00a72.1 above) at the heart of this dissonance: these facts should to be highlighted aggressively. And <i>early, </i>lest the dissonance sets in before the reader's sophistication.</li><li>Assuming you embrace self-effacement, connect the dots for your readers: highlight how Consequentialism <i>self-effaces \u2013 </i>where and how often it recommends <i>that one stop considering Consequentialism's theoretical justifications for one's actions.&nbsp;</i></li></ol></li></ol><p>Virtue ethicists, for their part, are known for forestalling self-effacement by just <i>not giving a theory in the first place </i>\u2013 by resisting the demand to give a unifying account of a broad range of normative judgments about actions. They tend to prefer taking things case by case, insistently pointing to specific details in specific examples and just saying <i>that's </i>what was key <i>in that situation. </i>They prefer studying the specific actions of virtuous exemplars and vicious foils. The formulation \"the right action is the one the virtuous agent would take\" is always reluctantly given, as more of a sketch of a theory than something we should think too hard about. This can make them frustrating theorists, but responsible writers (protecting you from developing thoughts too many), and decent moral guides. Excellent moral guides do less lecturing on moral theory, and more leading by example. Virtue ethicists like to sit somewhere in-between: they like <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2026358\">lecturing on examples</a>.</p><p>Note that, to proscribe consulting theory is <i>not </i>to prescribe pretense. <i>Pretending </i>to care (answering your friend \"because I was worried!\" when in fact your motivation was to maximize the general good) is just as ugly and will exacerbate the self-harm.&nbsp;That said theories <i>can </i>recognize that, under certain circumstances, \"fake it 'til you make it\" is the best policy available to an agent. Such might be the case for someone who was not fortunate enough to have good role models in their impressionable youth, and whose friends cannot/will not help them curb a serious vice. Conscious impersonation of the virtuous in an attempt to reshape their character might sadly be this person's best option for turning their life around. But note that, even when this is the case, success is never fully achieved if the pretense doesn't eventually <i>stop being pretense \u2013 </i>if the pretender doesn't eventually <i>win themselves over</i>, <i>displacing the motivation for pretense with the right motivation to act </i>(e.g. a direct concern for the sick friend)<i>.</i></p><h2>Prevention and Cure</h2><h3>Adopting VE vs. sophisticating Consequentialism</h3><p>Aware of thoughts too many, what should one do?</p><p>Well, you could embrace VE. Draw on the practical wisdom encoded in the rich vocabulary of virtue and vice, emphatically ending your reason-giving on specific details that are morally salient to the case at hand (e.g. \"Because ignoring Sal would have been callous! Haven't you seen how lonely they've been lately?\"). Don't fuss too much with integrating and justifying each instance of normative judgment with an over-arching system of principles: morally speaking, you're not really on the line for it, and its a hazardous task. If you are really so inclined, go ahead, but be sure to hang up those theoretical justifications when you leave the philosophy room, or the conscious self-improvement room. Sure, ignoring this sort of theoretical integration might<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefo3csv43h4vo\"><sup><a href=\"#fno3csv43h4vo\">[13]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;make you less morally <i>consistent</i>, but consistency is just one virtue: part of the lesson here is that, in practice, when humans consciously optimize very hard for moral consistency they typically end up making unacceptable trade-offs in other virtues. Rationalists seem especially prone to over-emphasize consistency.</p><p>Alternatively, you could further sophisticate your Consequentialism. With some contortion, the lessons here can be folded in. One could read the above as just more reason, <i>by consequentialist lights</i>, to operate as if VE were true: adopt the virtuous agent's decision procedure in order to avoid the harms resulting from thoughts too many and internal moral disharmony. But remark how <i>thorough </i>this co-opting strategy must now be: consequentialists won't avoid those harms with <i>mere impersonation </i>of the virtuous agent. Adopting the virtuous agent's decision procedure means <i>completely winning yourself over, </i>not just consciously reading off the script. Again, pretense that <i>remains </i>pretense not only fails to avoid thoughts too many but probably worsens the cognitive dissonance!&nbsp;</p><p>If you succeed in truly winning yourself over though, how much of your Consequentialism will remain? If you still engage in it, you will keep your consequentialist reasoning in check. Maybe you'll reserve it for moments of self-reflection, insofar as self-reflection is still needed to regulate and maintain virtue. Or you might engage in it in the philosophy room (wary that spending too much time in there is hazardous, engendering thoughts too many). At some point though, you might find it was your Consequentialism that got co-opted by VE: if you are very successful, it will look more like your poor past self <i>had to use consequentialist reasoning as a pretext for acquiring virtue,</i> something you now regard as having intrinsic value, something worth pursuing for its own sake... Seems more honest to me if you give up the game now and endorse VE. Probably more effective too.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, if you go in for the co-opt, don't forget, part of the lesson is to be mindful of the facts of human psychology. Invented virtues like the virtue of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZLBtZqsP79Cwioi2b/virtue-ethics-for-consequentialists\">always-doing-what-the-best-consequentialist-would-do</a>, besides being <i>ad hoc </i>and convenient for coddling one's Consequentialism, are circular and completely miss the point. Trying to learn such a virtue just reduces to trying to become \"the most consequential consequentialist.\" But the question for consequentialists is precisely that: <i>what character traits does the most consequential consequentialist tend to have</i>? The minimum takeaway of this post: they don't engage in consequentialist reasoning all the time!&nbsp;</p><p>Consequentialists might consider reading the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZYADHcQFXwwsaqrMq/virtue-ethics-and-why-the-rationalist-community-might-care#Lists_of_virtues_across_times_and_cultures\">traditional list of virtues</a> as a time-tested catalog of the most valuable character traits (by consequentialist lights) that are attainable for humans. (Though see \"objection h\" <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/#ObjeVirtEthi\">here</a>, for some complications on that picture).</p><h3>Becoming virtuous</h3><p>Whether we go with VE or Consequentialism, it seems we need to tap into whatever self-discipline (and self-disciplining tools) we have and begin a virtuous cycle of good habit formation. Just remember that chanting creeds to yourself and faking it 'til you make it aren't your only options! Encourage your friends to call out your vices. (In turn, steer your friends away from vice and try to be a good role model for the impressionable). Engage with good books, movies, plays etc. <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2026358\">Virtue ethicists note</a> that art has a great potential for exercising and training moral awareness, for providing us role models to take inspiration from, flawed characters to learn from, villains to revile. It's critical to see what honesty (and dishonesty), compassion (and callousness), courage (and cowardice) etc. look like in detailed, complex situations. Just knowing their dictionary definitions and repeating to yourself that you will (or won't) be those things won't get you very far. To <i>really </i>get familiar with them, you need to encounter many examples of them, within varied normative contexts. Again, the aim is to train a sort of <i>moral perception \u2013 </i>the ability to recognize, <i>in the heat of the moment, </i>right from wrong (and to a limited extent, why it is so), and react accordingly<i>. </i>In that sense, VE sees developing one's moral character as very similar (even intertwined with) developing one's aesthetic taste. Many of the virtues are <i>gut reactions </i>after all \u2013 the good ones<i>.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn988y21o8ml9\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref988y21o8ml9\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>M.

However, as someone who has been engaging with EA over the past few years and who has become increasingly connected with the community, I have a modest proposal I\u2019d like to share: EA needs more humor.</p><p>Criticism of EA has roots back in the \u201cearning to give\u201d era. <a href=\"https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_elitist_philanthropy_of_so_called_effective_altruism\"><u>This</u></a>&nbsp;<i>Stanford Social Innovation Review</i> editorial from 2013 describes EA as \u201ccold and hyper-rationalistic,\u201d deeming the idea of numerically judging charities as \u201cdefective altruism.\u201d <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/art-is-a-waste-of-time-or-so-effective-altruism-claims\"><u>This</u></a> piece in <i>Aeon</i> from 2014 essentially argues that the EA utilitarian worldview opposes art, aesthetic beauty, and creativity in general.</p><p>Criticism of EA has only heightened in recent years with the rise of longtermism. <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/why-longtermism-is-the-worlds-most-dangerous-secular-credo\"><u>Another</u></a>&nbsp;<i>Aeon</i>&nbsp;editorial from 2021 characterizes the \u201capocalypticism\u201d of longtermist thought as \u201cprofoundly dangerous\u201d while also lampooning EA organizations like the \u201cgrandiosely named Future of Humanity Institute\u201d and \u201cthe even more grandiosely named Future of Life Institute.\u201d</p><p>In the last few months before the FTX situation, criticism was directed at Will MacAskill\u2019s longtermist manifesto, <i>What We Owe the Future</i>. A <i>Wall Street Journal </i><a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-we-owe-the-future-review-a-technocrats-tomorrow-11661544593\"><u>review</u></a> concludes that \u201c\u2018What We Owe the Future\u2019 is a preposterous book\u201d and that it is \u201creplete with highfalutin truisms, cockamamie analogies and complex discussions leading nowhere.\u201d A <i>Current Affairs </i><a href=\"https://www.currentaffairs.org/2022/09/defective-altruism\"><u>article</u></a> once again evokes the phrase \u201cdefective altruism\u201d and asserts that MacAskill\u2019s book shows how EA as a whole \u201cis self-righteous in the most literal sense.\u201d</p><p>The above example are, of course, just a small snapshot of the criticism EA has faced. However, I think these examples capture a common theme in EA critiques. Overall, it seems that critics tend to characterize EA as a community of cold, calculating, imperious, pretentious people who take themselves and their ostensible mission to \u201csave humanity\u201d far too seriously.</p><p>To be honest, a lot of EA criticism seems like it\u2019s coming from cynical, jaded adults who relish in the opportunity to crush young people\u2019s ambitious dreams about changing the world. I also think many critics don\u2019t really understand what EA is about and extrapolate based on a glance at the most radical ideas or make unfair assumptions based on a list of EA\u2019s high-profile <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/25/big-tech-business-model-silicon-valley-twitter?ref=biztoc.com\"><u>Silicon Valley supporters</u></a>.</p><p>However, there is a lot of truth to what critics are saying: EA\u2019s aims are incredibly ambitious, its ideas frequently radical, and its organizations often graced with grandiose names. I also agree that the FTX/SBF situation has exposed glaring holes in EA philosophy and shortcomings in the organization of the EA community.</p><p>However, my personal experience in this community has been that the majority of EAs are not cold, calculating, imperious, pretentious people but warm, intelligent, honest, and altruistic individuals who wholeheartedly want to \u201cdo good better.\u201d</p><p>I think one thing the EA community could do moving forward to improve its external image and internal function is to embrace a bit more humor. EA could stand to acknowledge and make fun of the craziness of comparing the effectiveness of charities as disparate as a deworming campaign and a policy advocacy group, or the absurdity of a outlining a superintelligent extinction event.</p><p>I say these ideas are absurd not because I don\u2019t believe in them; I have the utmost respect for rigorous charity evaluators like GiveWell and am convinced that AI is indeed the most important problem facing humanity. But I think that acknowledging the external optics of these ideas and, to a degree, joking about how crazy they may seem could make EA less disagreeable for many people on the outside looking in.</p><p>There have already been solid examples of humor in the community. Criticism aside, Will MacAskill\u2019s <i>What We Owe the Future </i>demonstrates an excellent instance of levity. On page 15, MacAskill announces that he will depict all of the potential future generations by using little stick figures each representing 10 billion humans. The next three pages are filled with figures from top to bottom, and at the end MacAskill notes that the full version would actually fill 20,000 full pages.</p><p><a href=\"https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/book-review-what-we-owe-the-future\"><u>Some reviewers</u></a> have not appreciated this stick figure stunt, but I personally laughed out loud when I flipped through these pages. I think this is a perfect example of subtle humor that acknowledges the absurdity of longtermism while also imparting critical understandings on the scope and scale of the far-off future. By using pictograms that look like the gender sign on a bathroom door, MacAskill adds playfulness to his analysis and softens the grandiosity inherent in declaring that you will depict all of humanity\u2019s future generations. These pages successfully joke about the ambitions of longtermism while still taking the subject seriously.</p><p>Another example of EA humor can be found in Holden Karnofsky\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/most-important-century/\"><u>The Most Important Century</u></a>\u201d blog. For those unfamiliar, this is a series of posts arguing that the 21st century could be the most important in humanity\u2019s history\u2014i.e., a project only an EA would have the audacity to undertake.</p><p>A key part of Karnofsky\u2019s argument is the potential for transformative AI to arrive this century. AI is, for EAs, a deadly serious topic. But talking about AI development has a tendency to get really science fiction-y really quickly and seems (especially to people outside of EA) odd at best or overblown at worst. So, in a stroke of genius, Karnofsky <a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/transformative-ai-timelines-part-1-of-4-what-kind-of-ai/\"><u>defines</u></a> his conception of transformative AI as \u201cProcess for Automating Scientific and Technological Advancement, or PASTA.\u201d</p><p>In a mockingly apologetic footnote, Karnofsky writes, \u201cI'm sorry. But I do think the rest of the series will be slightly more fun to read this way.\u201d And he\u2019s absolutely right. PASTA embraces the absurdity of the transformative AI topic and makes the blog posts more enjoyable to read. Karnofsky even <a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/transformative-ai-timelines-part-1-of-4-what-kind-of-ai/#misaligned-ai-mysterious-potentially-dangerous-objectives\"><u>adds</u></a> a \u201cHotline Bling\u201d-inspired meme featuring the Terminator and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flying_Spaghetti_Monster\"><u>Flying Spaghetti Monster</u></a>. While perhaps a tad cringy, this move is so unexpected as to be hilarious on balance. Quite frankly, EA could stand to see more memes like this.</p><p>The use of PASTA in no way diminishes Karnofsky\u2019s arguments or makes his conclusions any less important. Rather, the use of a funny acronym to refer to AI makes the whole discussion seem less pretentious. I think PASTA is a model of subtle humor that, if imitated elsewhere, would make EA seem more relatable to anyone.</p><p>In terms of models outside of EA, John Oliver\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@LastWeekTonight\"><u>Last Week Tonight</u></a> (hereafter: LWT) offers a template that could work well for EA topics. If you haven\u2019t already heard of LWT, Oliver does weekly deep dive video segments on problems in the United States and around the world. Topics are wide-ranging, with the three most recent feature stories concerning the World Cup, the British Monarchy, and election subversion.</p><p>LWT features rigorous research and reporting while also employing top-notch slapstick humor. Oliver manages to make every episode both enlightening and entertaining, shining a light on overlooked societal problems in an accessible and enjoyable way. LWT shows that joking about something doesn\u2019t mean you are making light of it or not taking it seriously. Humor is just a way to make the bitter medicine of truth go down a little bit easier, enabling people to process information they otherwise couldn\u2019t stand to hear.</p><p>Oliver\u2019s approach has proven genuinely impactful. A <a href=\"https://time.com/3674807/john-oliver-net-neutrality-civil-forfeiture-miss-america/\"><i><u>Time </u></i><u>article</u></a> from 2015 coined the term \u201cthe John Oliver Effect\u201d to explain several instances where LWT episodes have contributed to real societal change, including ending unfair bail requirements in New York City, causing the resignation of FIFA president Sepp Blatter, and convincing the FCC to adopt net neutrality regulations, among other cases. LWT\u2019s impact <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/tv/2022/02/24/john-oliver-last-week-tonight/\"><u>has only grown</u></a> in the past seven years, the use of humor remaining integral to Oliver\u2019s continued commercial and political success.</p><p>I think LWT could be model for future EA content. Incorporating humor into discussions on existential risk, for instance, would make the information more approachable, encouraging people to learn about heavy and heady topics. Humor also diminishes any pretension that may come along with asserting that an issue is one of the most important problems facing humanity.</p><p>LWT is just one half-baked idea of how EAs could incorporate more humor into their work. To be sure, Oliver\u2019s in-your-face style will not work in many contexts or with many topics. However, I think LWT is a model showing how leveraging levity can be a truly effective approach to reaching people and driving societal change.</p><p>In closing, I am not suggesting that EAs should become outright comedians and make a joke out of everything. And in any case, perhaps EA should wait a bit to let the FTX storm die down before getting too jocular. But moving forward, I think the more EA learns to laugh at itself and in general, the less the public will view EA as so self-righteous or self-important.

Part of being effective is minimizing backlash, and framing your own recommendations in a way that smacks of arrogance makes people want to take you down a peg.</p></blockquote><p><strong>On how he thinks about the support he gives to other institutions</strong></p><p>The article does a good job describing what I think is a common experience of wanting to balance utilitarian EV-maximization versus deontological good citizenship and honorable behavior. &nbsp;(Of course, recently the Forum is awash in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XHrHsrQGyr4NnqCA7/we-must-be-very-clear-fraud-in-the-service-of-effective\">reminders that blatant dishonesty and crime should be unacceptable in the EA movement</a>. &nbsp;But I would be interested in hearing more discussion of these issues through a lens of smaller-scale, more everyday actions like Matt describes):</p><blockquote><p>Living here in D.C., I have the opportunity to take advantage of a lot of free museums and the National Zoo. I sometimes give to these programs and/or buy memberships whose value doesn\u2019t really pencil out with the understanding that membership is a way to support the institution. But the main reason I do that stuff is because <i>I</i> like these institutions. One of the things I like about them is that they don\u2019t charge admission, so visitors can check them out on a whim and people who couldn\u2019t afford tickets can still enjoy them. But I would not personally struggle to pay an admissions fee to these institutions if they charged one, and I do benefit from their ongoing existence, so I like to pitch in. I do think of this as part of an ethic of trying to be a not-awful person, but it\u2019s really just about being a cooperative member of society \u2014 someone who doesn\u2019t free ride \u2014 rather than being a truly other-directed gesture.</p></blockquote><p><strong>On Marginal Charity</strong></p><p>Throughout, the post emphasizes a multitude of ordinary, but intelligent and EA-informed actions that an ordinary person can take with little effort -- from making more effective political donations to making more helpful contributions at your child's school or local food-bank, the post is a great guide to implementing Robin Hanson's concept of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/marginal-charity\">marginal charity</a> in real life:</p><blockquote><p>I worry sometimes that people pay attention to national politics mostly because it\u2019s fun (Eitan Hirsh\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/3/11/21172064/politics-is-for-power-eitan-hersh-the-ezra-klein-show\">political hobbyism</a>) while telling themselves they are paying attention for high-minded reasons like the fate of the country. I\u2019m not going to tell you to stop following national politics (I\u2019m trying to make a living here), but it really is worth considering that to the extent you follow politics for high-minded reasons, you ought to prioritize your local politics.</p><p>Your state and local elected officials are relatively likely to respond to you if you write to them. What\u2019s more, the bar to becoming the best-informed person in your social circle or among your coworkers is probably relatively low. By consistently paying attention to local politics and engaging with local elected officials, you can become a local politics influencer who is telling other people who to vote for and which local pols are hardworking and effective and which are lazy time-servers.</p></blockquote><p>Personally, I would enjoy reading more posts like this -- in addition to describing their directly EA-oriented work and giving, hearing people talk about the various ways that they try to exercise marginal charity in other parts of their life.</p>", "user": {"username": "Jackson Wagner"}}, {"_id": "yFfTbT7oWxSadNJQq", "title": "SBF's recent live interview at the DealBook Summit", "postedAt": "2022-11-30T23:11:37.792Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>[PS: If you're hitting a paywall, you can use </strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/11/30/business/sam-bankman-fried-interview?unlocked_article_code=sl4nRgTVwcKT83DHPiReKt8TfOFJypL086WpOScRldg7n0-x-e8WFaTk6IZ_JeHF3WAKezOa3j4GdyDkJnYNo2N6uNWLAS4rdsnYAB58xnE7elve46iWqjoU5rUnbISMv9Qig1yowJCG_R2bvIltBvNG8An8LNNcGevJgmz808QUlY5ur6cRy9HeQdUv0ulMhRulzXgc9L_2odYbVPhvprNuru7mCWvXpPdYJJn7AfdroWr4E3iMtFgdJzqGwSfECcsRM5JdV_Z0ov3OlT_wP5c8JxuwMw0ElZVhifem9pr-vu_pkz8Ofdjz71eCOy8CGHPEUvus0q7U0crqJXWrnr30dQ5xnyfzAlpzcxb_lA&amp;smid=share-url\"><strong>this</strong></a><strong> link]</strong></p><p>Sam Bankman-Fried was recently <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/11/30/business/sam-bankman-fried-interview\">live interviewed</a> by Andrew Ross Sorkin from the New York Times as part of the DealBook summit, an interview which was scheduled before the FTX collapse and remained so.</p><p>The summary is that SBF tried to frame the collapse as a series of mistakes, propped by his ignorance on different aspects of accounting, risk management and what was happening at Alameda. &nbsp;As the NY Times reports, parts of his narrative seem to contradict evidence regarding the comingling of funds between FTX and Alameda.&nbsp;</p><p>For the most part, SBF also backed off many of the statements he made on <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vjyWBnCmXjErAN6sZ/kelsey-piper-s-recent-interview-of-sbf\">Kelsey Piper's interview</a>, especially regarding what some interpreted back then as him confessing of trying to deceive the public. Besides the occasional mention of donations, there was no mention of effective altruism.</p><p>Among some of the things he said:</p><ul><li>\u201cWas there comingling of funds?\u201d \u201cI didn't knowingly comingle funds. (\u2026) I was surprised as to how exposed Alameda's position was.\u201d</li><li>He pointed that he was misinformed by significant discrepancies between post facto accounting and what was informed by their internal dashboards.</li><li>\u201cI wasn't running Alameda, I didn't know exactly what was going on. (\u2026) Obviously that is a pretty bad mistake on my part, it was a pretty big oversight.\u201d</li><li>\u201cWhen did you think you knew there was a problem?\u201d \u201cNovember 6. That was the date when the tweet about CZ [Changpeng Zhao] came out.\u201d</li><li>He said he entered the interview against the advice by his lawyers. This at least seems to match with the partly incriminatory statements he made during the interview. \u201cThere\u2019s a time and a place for me to think about myself and my own future. I don\u2019t think this is it.\u201d</li><li>Regarding<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vjyWBnCmXjErAN6sZ/kelsey-piper-s-recent-interview-of-sbf\"> the interview with Kelsey Piper</a>, he attempted to recontextualize the comments he had made on doing good as merely differentiating between real impact (giving the example of bed nets for malaria) and other instrumental donations \u201cfor the business\u201d. His answer was not entirely clear. Regarding public deception, he later declared \u201cI was as truthful as I\u2019m knowledgeable to be, (\u2026) I don\u2019t know of times when I lied\u201d.</li><li>Regarding spending on houses and other things, he said it was part of a strategy to attract tech talent for FTX. Specifically regarding buying a property for his parents, he said they had only stayed there temporarily and that it was company property.</li><li>As for why investors like Sequoia Capital missed the risk management problems in FTX, he said they were worried about upsides, which is natural in their role as investors.</li><li>On drugs, he said he had taken prescribed stimulants for focus, but there was nothing surprising in that. He said reports about parties were greatly exaggerated, \u201cthere were no wild parties. At our parties, we play board games.\u201d.</li><li>On governance, he said he even thought, \u201cif anything, we had too many boards\u201d. &nbsp;He pointed that even though he believes that there were over 12 boards in different entities with regulatory functions, the problem was that there was no one explicitly in charge of customer risk management.</li><li>Finally, he explained that it was still possible to make costumers whole, or at the very least it was entirely possible a month ago (regretting bankruptcy). He pointed out to the existence of several assets which were merely illiquid, and pointed out that FTX US and FTX Japan were probably still completely solvent (as opposed to the larger FTX International).</li></ul>", "user": {"username": "agucova"}}, {"_id": "WRvdL9jsXdBerWgte", "title": "SBF Dealbook Thread ", "postedAt": "2022-11-30T23:02:53.668Z", "htmlBody": "<p>(I didn't see one and thought this would be helpful)&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Daedalus"}}, {"_id": "gKywAZWEWe4WWfoEx", "title": "Estimating the impact of community building work", "postedAt": "2022-12-01T23:42:54.296Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Epistemic state: very uncertain.

Community builders should incorporate elements of 1-1 in their own work as much as possible.</li><li><strong>Focusing on existing EAs and amplifying their impact </strong>is one of the most impactful things that a community builder can work toward.</li><li>The <strong>impacts of community-building are not insignificant </strong>and lead to substantial tangible benefits even in the short-term.</li><li>In estimating the effects of community building, <strong>second-order effects are of paramount importance</strong>; they often triple (or in some cases close to 10x) pure first-order effects.</li><li>A community builder working across <strong>different community building areas</strong> may have a \"cross-pollination effect\" that increases impact (see the Aside).</li></ul><h1>Motivation and strategy</h1><p>In this report, I attempt to quantitatively estimate the average impact of an EA community builder in a year. I begin by identifying relevant <strong>community-building activities </strong>and separating each activity into a particular bucket. These activities are identified as follows:</p><ol><li>organizing a <strong>school group</strong> and introductory fellowships for their school (e.g. EA at Oxford)</li><li>organizing a <strong>local group for professionals</strong> and introductory fellowships for their professional group (e.g. EA UK or more specific effective altruism groups for specific community niches)</li><li>organizing <strong>events</strong>, which I divide into three types below. Each type of event trades-off <i>engagement </i>for <i>efficiency</i><ul><li>3.1. <strong>1-1 discussions</strong> \u2014 very high <i>engagement</i> which leads to best outcomes, but organizing <i>efficiency </i>is low (e.g. career consultation with 80,000 Hours)</li><li>3.2. <strong>small-scaled events</strong> \u2014 moderate <i>engagement</i> potential which leads to moderate outcomes; less <i>efficiency</i> than organizing large-scaled events (e.g. a small-scaled speaker event)</li><li>3.3. <strong>large-scaled events</strong> \u2014 low to moderate <i>engagement</i> potential but the <i>efficiency</i> of organizing is likely high (e.g. EAGx)</li></ul></li></ol><p>I am to quantify the <strong>impact</strong> <strong>of an average community builder per year </strong>if they help organize the activities above by estimating the <strong>increase in the number of engaged EAs per year. </strong>I broadly consider engaged EAs to be those who give themselves an <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/eas2020-how-people-get-involved-in-ea\">engagement score of 4 or 5 on the EA Survey</a>.</p><p>I then estimated the <strong>expected increase of relevant figures per engaged EA </strong>as a result of their participation in community building activities. In particular, I attempt to estimate the impact of community building on two relevant metrics:</p><ul><li>increase in the amount of money donated to EA causes or EA-aligned charities as a direct result of community building activities</li><li>increase in the number of \"effective hours worked on <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/\">80,000 Hours cause areas</a> per week\" \u2014 I loosely define an \"effective hour\" as an hour that makes some progress towards contributing to a cause area. Community building may accelerate the progress of engaged EAs in upskilling/being productive in cause areas</li></ul><p><strong>How do I expect this estimate to be helpful? </strong>I broadly expect community builders to use such a quantitative model to estimate their impact \u2014 they can measure their impact as the <strong>number of engaged EAs that their activities attract</strong>, and then <strong>multiply this by the metrics above.</strong> For instance, someone who works on local group community-building could find their expected impact by:</p><span><span class=\"mjpage mjpage__block\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml MJXc-display\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\text{expected impact per year} =\\text{increase in \\$ donated/yr} \\times \\text{new engaged EAs from local group building}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mtext\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em;

some of my preliminary thoughts about this quantitative estimation exercise:</p><ul><li><strong>1-1s are extremely effective. </strong>The differential of a community builder organizing 1-1 events seems a lot more effective than contributing to helping with the organization of a large-scale/small-scaled event. It is perhaps the case that community builders should work towards finding more opportunities for 1-1 engagement (e.g. incorporating 1-1 elements between community builders and students in a student group).</li><li><strong>Focusing on existing EAs seems useful. </strong>The results reflect that focusing on EAs already making an impact and working to support them might have a much higher impact than attracting new students/professionals. As seen from the estimates, community builders who enhance the impact of individuals who are already working on causes by connecting them to other EAs, suggesting internships and resources etc. may be a very effective move for enhancing the movement overall.</li><li><strong>The impact of community building is not insignificant. </strong>An average community builder working on building up professional communities can raise $7.9k per year for EA-related causes (second-order estimate), with the amount increasing significantly assuming a 75th percentile (or more extreme) community-building outcome. For reference, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/11HsJLpq0Suf3SK_PmzzWpK1tr_BTd364j0l3xVvSCQw/edit#gid=1377543212\">Givewell's cost-effectiveness analysis</a> of Deworm the World in Kenya suggests that each philanthropic dollar spent leads to an increase of 0.11 \"units of value\". Therefore, raising $7.9k leads to an increase of ~869 units of value (equivalent to preventing approximately 10.5 deaths of an individual 5 or older from malaria per year). Increasing the number of effective hours worked also seems very important for pushing ahead on important EA cause areas, especially if many of the 80k cause areas are talent-constrained.</li><li><strong>Second-order effects are important, particularly for community building. </strong>Second-order effects (sometimes known as \"multiplier effects\") are pivotal to fully capture the impact of community building. They can often triple (or more) the estimated first-order effects.</li></ul><h2>Aside: how would a community builder go about envisioning their impact?</h2><p>We have estimated the number of engaged EAs that a community builder can recruit per year. <strong>The estimates above correspond to my thoughts about what a full-time community-builder would be able to achieve per year if they were only devoted to that one activity. </strong>Of course, community builders can mix between activities (e.g. spend 30% of the time working on a university group and 70% of the time organizing 1-1 events.) If a community builder wants to estimate their impact, I propose using something like the following formula:</p><span><span class=\"mjpage mjpage__block\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml MJXc-display\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\text{Impact}=\\lambda\\times\\sum_{\\text{activities}}\\text{% time spent on activity}\\times{\\text{impact of activity}}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mtext\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;\">Impact</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.077em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">=</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mi MJXc-space3\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">\u03bb</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space2\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">\u00d7</span></span><span class=\"mjx-munderover MJXc-space2\"><span class=\"mjx-itable\"><span class=\"mjx-row\"><span class=\"mjx-cell\"><span class=\"mjx-op\" style=\"padding-left: 0.665em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-size2-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.74em; padding-bottom: 0.74em;\">\u2211</span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-row\"><span class=\"mjx-under\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; padding-top: 0.236em; padding-bottom: 0.141em;\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mtext\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em; padding-bottom: 0.372em;\">activities</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-mtext MJXc-space1\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;\">% time spent on activity</span></span><span class=\"mjx-mo MJXc-space2\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">\u00d7</span></span><span class=\"mjx-texatom MJXc-space2\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-mtext\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.519em;\">impact of activity</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><p>Impact is the sum of all activities that a community builder helps organize multiplied by the time spent on the activity and a coefficient&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\lambda\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">\u03bb</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>.

You may have different credences based on your own information or think that my assumptions are systematically biased, could be too optimistic, or too pessimistic.</li><li><strong>Outcomes may not be useful. </strong>I\u2019m very specifically focused on the increase in donations and increase in effective time spent on 80k cause areas. It's plausible that there are more important outcomes or more relevant outcomes for the community builder than the outcomes that I have analyzed.</li><li><strong>Unspecific outcomes. </strong>The outcomes that have been analyzed are too unspecific and could be meaningless (e.g. the concept of an \"effective hour\" worked on a cause area may not be useful). Outcomes such as \"effective hours\" are also subjective and may not equate directly to <i>progress on solving the problem </i>(e.g. more time spent on AI alignment does not necessarily equate to more progress made on AI). <strong>It could be the case that effective time worked on cause areas has greatly diminishing returns, which is not accounted for within this model.</strong><ul><li>You might also think that the impact might be a lot larger for students who decide to work on AI safety rather than other cause areas and treat the conversion to \"priority cause areas\" (e.g. AI safety/biosecurity) as a more important metric.</li></ul></li><li><strong>The concept of an engaged EA is meaningless.</strong> You may not think that there is a clear delineation between an \"unengaged EA\" and an \"engaged EA\", or that the difference is not binary and should be further nuanced. The quantitative estimate that I have provided above does not suitably capture the nuances of this sliding scale.</li><li><strong>Short-term. </strong>One could also consider that the thinking behind this quantitative estimate could be considered very short-term, and the relevant outcomes that I have put forward today may be very different in the future as the EA movement grows further. This particularly seems relevant for the estimates for increase in donations, because <i>the estimates do not account for the donations of students in the future</i> and only account for the increase in donations when a local professional group is organized that moves people from being an unengaged professional EA to an engaged professional EA.</li><li><strong>The number of EAs does not matter. </strong>You might think that getting more people into effective altruism doesn't matter. For instance,<strong> </strong>some new EAs may quickly lose interest or some may be very dedicated and help recruit even more students next year, so the statistic itself is not useful for making estimates or analysis.</li><li><strong>No account for increasing/diminishing marginal returns.</strong> The model does not account for increasing/diminishing marginal returns (e.g. an EA going to 500 1-1s per year would probably derive much less value than an EA going to five 1-1s per year). It only accounts for the average effect of organizing a particular activity.</li><li><strong>Second-order effects are poorly estimated. </strong>The second-order effects may be very understated, particularly in the long term. It also does not consider further nth-order effects. As a result, it would be a good idea to treat this model as negatively biased. Alternatively, one could think that the second-order effects need to be further discounted because the community-builder might not actually be accountable for the second-order effects.

Doing so entails some form of discounting, with implications for cause prioritization, in particular for neglectedness \u2013 a part of the common ITN-framework [1].</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Model Setup</h2><p>I am trained as an economist instead of a philosopher. As such I will not present many words but instead a simple model. Consider the following two variables as primitives:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>D(t) \u2013 Donation of amount D &gt; 0 at time t</p><p>R(t) \u2013 Extinction risk in the interval from time 0 to time t<br>&nbsp;</p><p>For simplicity, and the sake of argument, consider that:</p><p>R(t)/t &gt; 0 is constant</p><p>The value of money is constant over time</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Result</h2><p>So we ask ourselves: should we donate now or in the future? Should we donate to a current or a future person?</p><p>To a current person we can donate D(0) now. This is illustrated at the left side in Illustration 1 below. There you see a current person, now, at time zero. To the right, time t is illustrated. In the future at time t people might still exist, if in the absence of extinction. This occurs with probability 1 - R(t). This hopefully likely scenario is depicted with the top arrow.</p><p>With probably R(t), however, extinction does occur, and instead, people no longer exist. When people have gone extinct, the donation D(0) can not find a destination at time t. With the donation non-existent in this scenario, it is effectively zero.</p><p>Now what, the illustration finally asks, is the expected value (EV) of D(t), a donation to a future person, at time zero, i.e. now?</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673889274/mirroredImages/HZhhHKnEgsonNQg7Q/mvgibymh8fuunwq6ajmo.png\"><figcaption>Illustration 1. Donate now or in the future, i.e. to a current or future person?</figcaption></figure><p>We can calculate this with the following mathematics. Applying the definition of an expected value, we sum the probability of each scenario occurring multiplied with its value. We maintain the same order, thus first considering the scenario of non-extinction and then of extinction: (1 - R(t)) * D(0) + R(t) * 0 = (1 - R(t)) * D(0)</p><p>The resulting right hand side is smaller than D(0): (1 - R(t)) * D(0)&nbsp; &lt;&nbsp; D(0)&nbsp;</p><p>Or without the brackets:&nbsp; D(0) - R(t) * D(0)&nbsp; &lt;&nbsp; D(0)</p><p>Thus, if we want to donate D(0) in expected value at time t, i.e. E[D(t)]=D(0), we need to donate D(0) / (1 - R(t)) &gt; D(0) now, into the future. Since, plugging this in for D(0) in the above expected value yields D(0): (1 - R(t)) * D(0) / (1 - R(t)) + R(t) * 0 = D(0)</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h2>In conclusion</h2><p>Future people might not exist. Therefore, to donate D(0) as effectively in future time t to a future person as D(0) now to a current person, we need to add to the donation an additional: D(0) / (1 - R(t)) - D(0)</p><p>In other words, to be indifferent between donating some amount D now to a current person and the same amount D at future time point t to a future person, future people need to be positively discriminated by a factor: D(0) / (1 - R(t)).</p><p>This (positive discrimination) might thus be advised against, as it is not in line but in conflict with non-discrimination based on time of birth. The first take home message is: To not discriminate between current people and future people we need to care less about future people than about current people, precisely by the risk of their extinction. We could see this as, e.g., analogous to a corrupt government skimming R(t)% off each donation D(t). Or as analogous to the \u201cmultiplier effect\u201d, which we know from the difference in cost of living and thereby cost-effectiveness of interventions in \u2018developed\u2019 and \u2018developing\u2019 countries \u2013 terms I object to, since we should all be developing (based on Kate Raworth\u2019s Doughnut model [2], which emphasizes current welfare and possible welfare for future generations).<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Discussion</h2><h3>- additional considerations</h3><p>In reflection we can consider some additional considerations. Distinct from what we assume would not happen \u2013 the value of money and/or the extinction rate changing \u2013 it might happen that the donation itself is at risk (of going extinct), or becomes obsolete (e.g., future people are very well off and thus have less or no need for it).</p><p>In my own schooling, these reasons are also the exact and classical reasons why an economist applies discounting, to consider people further into the future less. The just-mentioned events strengthen the conclusion, but one might also imagine similar events with an opposite effect, and morally we have to judge ourselves what is probable.</p><p>Another, final consideration might be that pay it forward effects might differ between people. Different people might have more positive effects than others as a consequence of the donation. Again this might work in either way, but one direction is likely more likely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>- usefulness</h3><p>And notwithstanding these additional considerations, is the concluded result useful? I believe so. Foremost because it provides a slightly more accurate, and truthful ideal for effective altruism specifically with regards to the moral consideration of future people, thus thereby also slightly reducing an otherwise possible and unwarranted fanaticism.</p><p>I think the result we concluded is often already acknowledged but more often not. Messaging would I think be stronger if it was clear, unambiguous, truthful and united in this.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>- an implied insight</h3><p>Another insight that results from the concluded result, and that perhaps is also useful, is that as extinction risk decreases we should care more about future (compared to current) people. And also vice versa, as extinction risk increases we should care less about future (compared to current) people. Next Illustration 2 illustrates the inverse relation in this insight.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673889274/mirroredImages/HZhhHKnEgsonNQg7Q/smp3pa0xizyoj4vfc3uw.png\"><figcaption>Illustration 2. An inverse relation between extinction risk and concern for future people.</figcaption></figure><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h2>Extension</h2><p>In closing, I would like to mention one effect in addition to the inverse relation shown in Illustration 2. This concerns populations of individuals instead of single individuals. And particularly populations aimed at persistence, e.g. by procreating and attempting to survive. Also I will use existential risks now instead of extinction risks, the risk of permanently losing the possibility of a worthwhile future instead of no longer existing, which includes but is more general than only extinction risks.</p><p>The additional effect is that as existential risks decrease, the expected value of the whole future increases, and thus the concern for the future one should have and the value of further mitigating existential risks also increases. A positive feedback loop results (which could also take effect in the opposite direction).</p><p>Addressing one existential risk, thus increases the value of addressing the next existential risk. And this is also relevant for cause prioritization. (One can also note that with the definition of an existential risk, this positive feedback loop is already logical/intuitive. After all, an existential risk in the future, say at time t, conditions on the absence of an existential risk between time 0, now, and time t: if a worthwhile future has already been permanently lost, it cannot be lost again. Conceptually this also relates to Tarsney\u2019s ENEs [2].)</p><p>A second take home message is thus that in prioritizing addressing existential risks, not neglectedness but non-neglectedness might \u2013 perhaps counter-intuitively \u2013 contribute</p><h2><br>Acknowledgements</h2><p><i>These thoughts were developed during and with thanks to the 2022 EA Munich Longtermism Fellowship and, before that, the Eon Essay writing contest regarding Ord\u2019s The Precipice.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>References</h2><ol><li>The ITN framework: <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/itn-framework\">https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/itn-framework</a></li><li>Kate Raworth, Doughnut Economics: https://www.amazon.com/Doughnut-Economics-Seven-21st-Century-Economist/dp/1603586741</li><li>Christian Tarsney, The epistemic challenge to longtermism: <a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/christian-tarsney-the-epistemic-challenge-to-longtermism/\">https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/christian-tarsney-the-epistemic-challenge-to-longtermism/</a></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "Indra"}}, {"_id": "Sc8XLTPaNiKFJcvsg", "title": "Downvotes Are Evidence", "postedAt": "2022-11-30T18:09:12.068Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Downvotes are evidence.

Downvotes can be a sign that a topic is important to discuss further.</p>\n<p>Downvotes can also be evidence that something is an outlier, which can be a good thing.</p>\n<h2>Downvoting Misquoting Criticism</h2>\n<p>One of the things that seems to have struck a nerve with some people, and has gotten me the most downvotes, is <strong>criticizing misquoting</strong> (examples <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/FbvsteE8ySnpFbjuk/misquoting-is-conceptually-similar-to-deadnaming-a\">one</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pSzxJhmZLfMWmrok7/misquoting-and-scholarship-norms\">two</a> both got to around -10). <em>I believe the broader issue is my belief that \u201csmall\u201d or \u201cpedantic\u201d errors are (sometimes) important, and that raising intellectual standards would make a large overall difference to EA\u2019s correctness and therefore effectiveness.</em></p>\n<p>I\u2019ll clarify this belief more in future posts despite the cold reception and my expectation of getting negative rewards for my efforts. I think it\u2019s important. It\u2019s also clarified a lot in prior writing on my websites.</p>\n<p>There are practical issues regarding how to deal with \u201csmall\u201d errors in a time-efficient way. I have some answers to those issues but I don\u2019t think they\u2019re the main problem. In other words, I don\u2019t think many people <strong>want</strong> to be able to pay attention to small errors, but are limited by time constraints and don\u2019t know practical time-saving solutions. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a goal they have that is blocked by practicality. I think people like something about being able to ignore \u201csmall\u201d or \u201cpedantic\u201d errors, and practicality then serves as a convenient excuse to help hide the actual motivation.</p>\n<p>Why do I think there\u2019s any kind of hidden motivation? It\u2019s not just the disinterest in practical solutions to enable raising intellectual standards (which I\u2019ve seen year after year in other communities as well, btw). Nor is it just the downvotes that are broadly not accompanied by explanations or arguments. It\u2019s primarily the <em>chronic ambiguity</em> about whether people <em>already agree with me and think obviously misquotes are bad</em> on the one hand or <em>disagree with me and think I\u2019m horribly wrong</em> on the other hand. Getting a mix of responses including both ~\u201cobviously you\u2019re right and you got a negative reaction because everyone already knows it and doesn\u2019t need to hear it again\u201d and ~\u201cyou\u2019re wrong and horrible\u201d is weird and unusual.</p>\n<p>People generally seem unwilling to actually clearly state what their misquoting policies/attitudes are, but nevertheless say plenty of things that indicate clear disagreements with me (when they speak about it at all, which they often don\u2019t but sometimes do). And this allows a bunch of other people to think there already are strong anti-misquoting norms, including people who do not actually personally have such a norm. In my experience, this is widespread and EA seems basically the same as most other places about it.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m not including examples of misquotes, or ambiguous defenses of misquotes, because I don\u2019t want to make examples of people. If someone wants to claim they\u2019re right and make public statements they stand behind, fine, I can use them as an example. But if someone merely posts on the forum a bit, I don\u2019t think I should interpret that as opting in to being some kind of public intellectual who takes responsibility for what he says, claims what he says is important, and is happy to be quoted and criticized. (People often don\u2019t want to directly admit that they don\u2019t think what they post is important, while also not wanting to claim it\u2019s important. That\u2019s another example of chronic ambiguity that I think is related to irrationality.) If someone says to me \u201cThis would convince me if only you had a few examples\u201d I\u2019ll consider how to deal with that, but I don\u2019t expect that reaction (and if you care that much you can find two good examples by reviewing my EA posting history, and many many examples of representative non-EA misquotes on my websites and forum).</p>\n<h2>Upvoting Downvoted Posts</h2>\n<p>There\u2019s a pattern on Reddit, which I\u2019ve also observed on EA, where people upvote stuff that\u2019s a negative points which they don\u2019t think deserves to be negative. They wouldn\u2019t upvote it if it had positive votes. You can tell because the upvoting stops when it gets back to neutral karma (actually slightly less on EA due to strong votes \u2013 people tend to stop at 1, not at the e.g. 4 karma an EA post might start with).</p>\n<p>In a lot of ways I think this is a good norm. Some people are quite discouraged by downvotes and feel bad about being disliked. The lack of reasons to accompany downvotes makes that worse for some types of people (though others would only feel worse if they were told reasons). And some downvotes are unwarranted and unreasonable so counteracting those is a reasonable activity.</p>\n<p><strong>However, there\u2019s a downside to upvoting stuff that\u2019s undeservedly downvoted. It hides evidence.</strong> It makes it harder for people to know what kinds of things get how many downvotes. Downvotes can actually be important evidence about the community. Reddit is larger and many subreddits have issues with many new posts tending to get a few downvotes that do <em>not</em> reflect the community and might even come from bots. I\u2019m not aware of EA having this problem. It\u2019s stuff that is downvoted more than normal which provides useful evidence. On EA, a lot of posts get no votes, or just a few upvotes. I believe getting to -10 quickly isn\u2019t normal and is useful evidence of something, rather than something that should just be ignored as meaningless. Also it only happens to a minority of my posts. The majority get upvotes not downvotes.)</p>\n", "user": {"username": "Elliot Temple"}}, {"_id": "NqZLnnR7qqESk29Gh", "title": "Economics and Population Growth Reading List", "postedAt": "2022-11-30T15:17:35.173Z", "htmlBody": "<p>The reading list below is based on a reading list originally used for an internal GPI reading group.

Operating from effective altruism principles, ALI seeks to develop, support, and accelerate activities that have positive animal welfare impacts during rearing on farms and during capture in wild fisheries. ALI founded the first global alliance for aquatic animal welfare, the Aquatic Animal Alliance (AAA), now comprised of over 110 member organizations. As new issues arise in this space, we too must steer our efforts in an attempt to curb any additional aquatic animal suffering before it begins.&nbsp;</p><h1>What?</h1><p>The consumer appetite for octopus and squid continues to grow, but wild populations are unstable. The seafood industry is looking to fill the supply gap through new factory farming projects despite numerous environmental, social, public health and animal welfare concerns.&nbsp;</p><p>ALI is implementing a global campaign that aims to increase public and legislative pressure on countries/regions where octopus farms are being considered to achieve a regulatory ban, and reduce future chances of these farms being created elsewhere. Additionally, we will work with corporations on procurement policies banning the purchase of farmed octopus.</p><h1>Why?</h1><p>The development of octopus farming casts a spotlight on the collection of concerns connected to these intensive practices. Rather than incentivizing the research and development of aquaculture that could be \u201cefficient and cheap enough\u201d to be commercialized, we should direct investment efforts towards innovative,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.greenqueen.com.hk/asias-top-cultivated-seafood-companies/?ct=t%28OCT+8+2020+INDUSTRY+SCOOP_COPY_01%29\"><u>alternative forms of seafood</u></a>. From sustainable, environmental, and ethical&nbsp; perspectives, octopus farming should not exist.</p><hr><h2>Campaign Summary&nbsp;</h2><p>We envision a future in which aquatic animal suffering is dramatically reduced in factory farms. Aquatic animal welfare is a highly neglected and tractable issue. Approximately 500 billion aquatic animals are farmed annually in high-suffering conditions and, to date, there is negligible advocacy aimed at improving welfare conditions for these remarkable beings. We support research to compare potential welfare interventions, and then advocate for the implementation of the most promising initiatives, with the aim of positively impacting aquatic lives for years to come.&nbsp;</p><p>ALI unites nonprofits, academic institutions, industry stakeholders, and the public with the common goal of reducing aquatic animal suffering. Our internal research team identifies priorities in areas of uncertainty with the goal of creating a framework to compare the relative impact of different interventions. We then advocate for high aquatic animal welfare amongst key decision-makers that influence how aquatic animals are utilized (e.g. by industry), and how their welfare is defined and governed (e.g. by standards, certifications, policies and guidelines).&nbsp;</p><p>ALI spearheads the Aquatic Animal Alliance (AAA), a historic global coalition that believes aquatic animals should lead lives free of industrial suffering. Founded in 2020, the AAA is modeled after Open Wing Alliance, Climate Justice Alliance, and other powerful coalition groups that have demonstrated we are strongest when we work together. Through this coalition, we work with over 110 animal protection organizations across six continents to collectively address the issues facing trillions of aquatic animals.&nbsp;</p><p>A ban on cephalopod farming would call on all pillars of ALI\u2019s operation (coalition building, research, and policy change) that could lead to monumental success and trigger institutional/market change.&nbsp;</p><p>An overarching goal of this project is to launch a global initiative to increase public and legislative pressure on countries/regions where cephalopod farms are being considered (i.e Spain, , Mexico, the EU), in order to achieve a ban and reduce future chances of these farms being created elsewhere. To accomplish this task, we will use a multifaceted approach to target smaller objectives.&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Conduct and map a research landscape that identifies any gaps and existing resources and/or studies. This analysis will include a thorough scientific evaluation of what is known or currently being studied about octopus welfare in captivity and their natural behaviors. We will track any current policies in place within the EU (specifically Spain) that could apply to aquatic animal protection. Understanding economic imports/exports, capturing regions, species\u2019 traits, etc. will also serve as a useful tool during this phase.&nbsp;</li><li>Create a campaign landscape analysis and identify key stakeholders that should be the targets of the campaign communications using the knowledge obtained from step 1.&nbsp;</li><li>Coordinate with participating members of the AAA to build a strategy, estimate a timeline, and agree on all goals. This phase will also involve the development and creation of several communication pieces (infographics, blog posts, etc.) from multiple organizations, taking an international approach to target different regions in various languages.&nbsp;</li><li>We will then launch the coalition campaign using materials from step 3 in specific regions focused on a few key targets previously identified in step 2.&nbsp;</li><li>Strategies used in this campaign will involve research, communications, and policy. We will evaluate our success through documents/articles produced, meaningful engagement with a variety of stakeholders, and the amount of media attention received (thus raising public and industry awareness). Additional success will be measured through meeting opportunities with key legislative decision makers, government support, and regulatory halt to any further operation or mobilization of octopus farms.&nbsp;</li><li>Build and strengthen relationships with global experts and advisors through the creation of the Aquatic Animal Policy (AAP) focus group to capitalize on global policy opportunities, and form unified welfare asks. We will coordinate the focus group and create collaborative, useful resources (i.e. legislative ban proposals, open letters, etc.) to accompany our efforts.</li></ol><hr><h2>Activities to Date</h2><p>The latest summary of our activities (from June 8, 2022) related to the octopus farming ban campaign are listed below.</p><ul><li>On May 9th we sent a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dWOemJTg1DX3Iqv0Q9ukj3l9JMZJmr8QBAikvlC1Jsg/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>letter to the Canary islands environmental agency</u></a> highlighting the potential environmental and biosecurity risks of approving the permit for an octopus farm proposed by Nueva Pescanova.

In 2020, My Octopus Teacher, a Netflix original documentary film, captured the heartfelt relationship between human and octopus, placing a spotlight on these miraculous creatures. However, these same creatures are all too often treated as a commodity, which encourages the dangerous possibility of cruel, industrialized cephalopod farming.&nbsp;</p><p>In March of 2022, we coordinated 2 online events (mentioned above) featuring renowned experts: Caroline Roose (European Parliament MEP), Dr. Elena Lara (CIWF UK), Dr. Heather Browning (London School of Economics), and Amandine Sanvisens (previously Head of the Aquatic Life Institute Europe), to better understand the research behind pushing for implementing advocacy efforts against octopus farming, and why we must establish legal protection now.&nbsp;</p><p>Cephalopod sentience has already been extensively proven. In November 2021, the United Kingdom extended the scope of the Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill to recognise octopus and cephalopod molluscs as sentient beings following the findings of a government-commissioned independent review by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/news/news-assets/pdfs/2021/sentience-in-cephalopod-molluscs-and-decapod-crustaceans-final-report-november-2021.pdf\"><u>London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE)</u></a>. The five-year project drew on more than 300 existing scientific studies to reach a sentient conclusion, and the authors recommended that the government expand its definition of animal welfare to include these animals. On April 7, 2022, the UK Animal Welfare (Sentience) Bill passed its final stages in UK Parliament to become law.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ciwf.org.uk/news/2021/10/octopus-farming-a-recipe-for-disaster\"><u>scientists have highlighted the many issues of octopus farming</u></a>, all of which are related to the fact that these animals, like many others, are not suited in any way, shape, or form, for large-scale farming. ALI turns to our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ali.fish/aquaculture-welfare-guide\"><u>5 pillars of welfare</u></a> in engagements with key decision-makers. These areas of consideration include: environmental enrichment, feed composition, stocking density and space requirements, water quality, and stunning and slaughter. However, each pillar of octopus welfare is violated when factory farming systems are introduced.&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Environmental Enrichment:&nbsp;<ol><li>They are intelligent and inquisitive. Such a high level of enrichment would not be possible, resulting in extreme boredom and chronic mental/physical stress.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>Feed Composition:&nbsp;<ol><li>They rely on unsustainable carnivorous diets. An increased use of fishmeal/fish oil derived from capture fisheries would place even more pressure on an already unsustainable practice.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>Stocking Density &amp; Space Requirements:&nbsp;<ol><li>These animals are solitary by nature. High stocking densities, which is a standard industry practice to amplify production in farms could result in cannibalism.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>Water Quality:&nbsp;<ol><li>They are very fragile due to the lack of internal or external skeletons, and could be highly susceptible to any sudden changes in their environment.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>Stunning &amp; Slaughter:&nbsp;<ol><li>Presently, no humane method of slaughter exists. Slaughter methods have been studied, however, none have been scientifically approved as humane.&nbsp;</li></ol></li></ol><hr><h2>What We\u2019d Like to Know</h2><ul><li>Can cephalopods - octopus, cuttlefish, squid - be farmed sustainably?</li></ul><p>Sustainable development, by definition, is to satisfy the demands of current generations without threatening the needs of future generations, while taking economic growth, environmental care, and social well-being into account. Under this principle, \u201csustainable\u201d octopus farming cannot exist.</p><p>Commercial aquaculture is unsustainable by nature. Aquaculture has been touted as a solution to overfishing and food security. However, farming carnivorous species, such as octopus and squid, requires an increase in the number&nbsp; of marine species sourced from already strained fisheries using inhumane fishing practices, contributing to a further decrease in declining populations.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/are.15126\"><u>One study</u></a> found that the optimal feeding frequency for oval squid is four to five times per day. Such practices exacerbate food insecurity issues in coastal communities that could otherwise use those lower-level protein sources (e.g. anchovies), that are rich in nutrients and energy, which are instead fed to farmed species.&nbsp;</p><p>Commercial aquaculture farms also carry a number of biosecurity and biophysical threats to surrounding environments. A large area of concern is the potential development and rapid spread of unknown pathogens and disease, which could create a substantial public health crisis. COVID-19 has taken place against a backdrop of numerous animal pandemics, each with significant human causal factors. The underwater health and resilience of animals in aquatic farm systems is intertwined with the economic health, public resilience, and security of human society. The exotic diseases and pathogens associated with unprecedented octopus farming could create an existential threat with little solutions that are readily available. These threats could have detrimental effects on local aquatic animals either indirectly through unknown contaminants and pollutants transferred through discharge, or directly through farmed and wild aquatic animal interactions made possible by instances of escape. If any escapes were to occur due to human error or natural disasters that harm the integrity of enclosures, then diseases, pathogens, chemicals, etc. could be passed from farmed to wild populations leading to negative interactions with local animals and ecosystems and a decrease in the genetic integrity of native aquatic animals.&nbsp;</p><p><i>We are confident in stating that this is an unsustainable practice, however, any counter arguments are welcomed in order to have a better understanding of the different viewpoints surrounding this topic.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><ul><li>What are other perspectives, particularly from an Effective Altruism standpoint (e.g. longtermism), have we not yet considered related to institutional arguments that could convince regulatory agencies that octopus farm operations should be banned?</li><li>Are there any research gaps that should be addressed or investigated?</li></ul><hr><p>We welcome any suggestions or feedback on the information presented here and hope that this insightful forum can provide support in strengthening this initiative.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Tessa @ ALI"}}, {"_id": "bFDwxxfErRStMvuAQ", "title": "Biological Anchors external review by Jennifer Lin (linkpost)", "postedAt": "2022-11-30T13:06:44.056Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This report is one of the winners of the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/YgbpxJmEdFhFGpqci/winners-of-the-ea-criticism-and-red-teaming-contest#Biological_Anchors_external_review_by_Jennifer_Lin___20_000_\">EA Criticism and Red Teaming Contest</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Summary: </strong>This is a summary and critical review of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KrJfoZzpSDpnrv9va/draft-report-on-ai-timelines\">Ajeya Cotra\u2019s biological anchors report on AI timelines</a>.

While most of these are adults, 112 children (under 18 years of age) were in need of a replacement kidney in April 2021 (most recent <a href=\"https://nhsbtdbe.blob.core.windows.net/umbraco-assets-corp/24212/annual-stats.pdf\">data</a> available).&nbsp; While waiting for a replacement kidney, these individuals must undergo renal dialysis for three to four hours per session, three times every week, which imposes severe limitations on the freedom in their lives and their ability to enjoy a \u2018normal\u2019 existence.&nbsp; Around <a href=\"https://www.giveakidney.org/why-we-need-more-donors/\">250</a> of these people die every year, either because a suitable donor cannot be identified in time, or after they are removed from the waiting list due to a deterioration in their health that renders them no longer able to endure the necessary surgery and immunosuppressive therapies inherent to organ transplantation.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Around 3,000 kidney donations take place in the UK each year, of which about 2,000 originate from deceased donors (an opt-out system of organ donation after death came into effect in <a href=\"https://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/uk-laws/organ-donation-law-in-wales/\">Wales</a> in 2015, in <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/news/opt-out-organ-donation-max-and-keira-s-bill-passed-into-law\">England</a> in 2020, and in <a href=\"https://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/uk-laws/organ-donation-law-in-scotland/\">Scotland</a> in 2021, and <a href=\"https://www.organdonation.nhs.uk/uk-laws/organ-donation-law-in-northern-ireland/\">Northern Ireland</a> will follow suit in 2023), and about 1,000 from living <a href=\"https://nhsbtdbe.blob.core.windows.net/umbraco-assets-corp/24212/annual-stats.pdf\">donors</a>.&nbsp; Kidneys constitute by far the most frequently donated solid <a href=\"https://nhsbtdbe.blob.core.windows.net/umbraco-assets-corp/24212/annual-stats.pdf\">organ</a> in the UK (67.6% of all solid organ donations in 2019/20), followed by liver lobes (which can also be donated by living donors), and heart, lungs and pancreas (which obviously cannot).</p><h2>How are kidneys from living donors shared in the UK?</h2><p>Kidneys donated from living donors are \u2018shared\u2019 across the UK through the UKLKSS, which includes paired/pooled donations (PPD), and altruistic donor chains (ADCs) that are initiated by non-directed altruistic donors (NDADs).</p><p>A person in need of a kidney (the recipient) may have a specific individual (such as a family member, partner or close friend) who is prepared to donate one to them (the donor), but is unable to do so directly since this donor-recipient pair is incompatible by Human Leucocyte Antigen (HLA) type or ABO blood group.&nbsp; Such incompatible linked donor-recipient pairs are registered in the UKLKSS and \u2018matched,\u2019 through quarterly Living Donor Kidney Matching Runs (LDKMR), with other incompatible linked donor-recipient pairs that, in some combination, are together compatible for donation exchanges.&nbsp;</p><p>In PPDs, a two-way (in paired donation) exchange occurs between two linked pairs (D1-R1 and D2-R2) in which D1 donates to R2, and D2 donates to R1, while a three- or greater-way (in pooled donation) exchange occurs between more than two linked pairs in which (for example) D1 donates to R2, D2 donates to R3, and D3 donates to R1.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669810836/mirroredImages/CWAHovjrT4L9RStmm/tvamb8xx0sly497rainw.png\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CWAHovjrT4L9RStmm/m28pmfopi8fhhbru4mwa 138w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CWAHovjrT4L9RStmm/mjdj93djfqr5arsmt6l6 218w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CWAHovjrT4L9RStmm/kdefytketyxazp2wqvke 298w\"><figcaption>Two-way exchange (paired donation). <a href=\"https://publicdocuments.sth.nhs.uk/pd10597.pdf \">Source</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669810836/mirroredImages/CWAHovjrT4L9RStmm/b1pfcncohcpnw3zi7x6h.png\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CWAHovjrT4L9RStmm/detobo88wkiao7nijlul 154w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CWAHovjrT4L9RStmm/c3bps4ft2xhnzgctteaq 234w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CWAHovjrT4L9RStmm/hqj7xxcxrwzwv1jhfqkd 314w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CWAHovjrT4L9RStmm/zysx0xcwybpj8ozpxllq 394w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CWAHovjrT4L9RStmm/kfbm1vmjztjkagmmldcq 474w\"><figcaption>Three-way exchange (pooled donation). <a href=\"https://publicdocuments.sth.nhs.uk/pd10597.pdf\">Source</a>.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Individuals not in linked pairs but who wish to donate a kidney without the promise of a linked recipient receiving one in return can do so anonymously as NDADs.&nbsp;

The first non-directed altruistic kidney donation in the UK took place in 2006 and, since the beginning of the UKLKSS in 2012, around 60-100 NDADs have donated a kidney in the UK each year, constituting <a href=\"https://nhsbtdbe.blob.core.windows.net/umbraco-assets-corp/27043/1-setting-the-scene-activity-data-tools-and-resources-opportunities-in-uklkss-m-robb.pdf\">6-10%</a> of the total number of annual living donor kidney donations in the country.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669810836/mirroredImages/CWAHovjrT4L9RStmm/x4r0vyrgcraa4n80qksf.png\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CWAHovjrT4L9RStmm/drftnajizcu8wwgjy4v1 154w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CWAHovjrT4L9RStmm/bg60qcyh49niw1vxo5vi 234w\"><figcaption>Non-directed altruistic donation triggering an ADC. <a href=\"https://publicdocuments.sth.nhs.uk/pd10597.pdf\">Source</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>Each LDKMR identifies PPD exchanges and ADCs in optimal combinations by considering, amongst other <a href=\"https://www.odt.nhs.uk/living-donation/uk-living-kidney-sharing-scheme/\">factors</a>: the number of LDKMRs the recipient has previously participated in, the age difference between donors, and the proximity of donors and recipients (the complexity of coordinating ADCs, which may involve three simultaneous donor nephrectomies, cross-country transportation of donated kidneys, and three simultaneous graft insertions, each potentially at different Transplant Centres across the UK, is of substantial scale).&nbsp; Around 250-300 potential recipients partake in each quarterly LDKMR, some 25% of which are usually new patients parking in their first matching run.&nbsp; Since <a href=\"https://www.odt.nhs.uk/living-donation/uk-living-kidney-sharing-scheme/ Data to support decision making ppt\">2012</a> about 34% of recipients have received a donated kidney after partaking in four or fewer quarterly matching runs (thereby receiving a kidney within one year of entering the UKLKSS), and 15% have done so after partaking in only one matching run.</p><h2>The process of donating through the UKLKSS</h2><p>The following summarises the major phases of my donation process through the UKLKSS: pre-LDKMR, post-LDKMR, the surgery, and the recovery.</p><h3><strong>Pre-LDKMR</strong></h3><ul><li>Contacted the Living Donor Co-ordinator Nursing Team in my regional kidney transplant centre (of which there are <a href=\"https://nhsbtdbe.blob.core.windows.net/umbraco-assets-corp/16482/contact-details-for-kidney-transplant-centres-2019.pdf\">23</a> across the UK) to arrange an initial consultation.&nbsp;</li><li>First appointment with Living Donor Nurse, in which the work-up, surgery, recovery, and associated risks were clearly outlined.&nbsp; I was then left to contact the Team if I wanted to proceed after discussing the process with loved ones (the Team did not chase me for my decision to ensure I felt no undue pressure).&nbsp; When I spontaneously remade contact, a second appointment was arranged.</li><li>Second appointment with Living Donor Nurse, in which I clarified my decision to proceed with the process, and underwent a series of investigations (a renal tract ultrasound scan, ECG, chest X-ray, various fasted blood tests, a series of blood tests following an intravenous infusion [to calculate glomerular filtration rate], and a CT scan of my kidneys).</li><li>Appointment with a renal consultant (for a medical review).</li><li>Appointment with a transplant surgeon (for a surgical review, and to discuss the surgery and recovery in greater detail).</li><li>Appointment with a clinical psychologist (to discuss my general state of mind, and my reasoning for wanting to go ahead with the donation), who also met with a loved one in my absence to gain further insight into my psychological state.</li><li>Appointment with an independent actor from the Human Tissue Authority (to ensure I was not under the influence of any coercive forces and did not stand to gain financially from donating a kidney).</li></ul><p>Following these consultations and investigations I was deemed suitable to donate and was entered into the July 2022 LDKMR as a NDAD.&nbsp; I was matched with a potential recipient and would trigger an ADC in which three people with ESRD would receive a donated kidney.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Post-LDKMR</strong></h3><ul><li>Surgery date was arranged (this took around four weeks to be agreed upon, as it required coordination between three Transplant Centres across the UK to organise two lots of three simultaneous surgeries [three simultaneous nephrectomies followed by three simultaneous graft insertions] with cross-country transportation of three organs between these surgeries).&nbsp; The surgery date was booked for 10 weeks after the LDKMR.</li><li>Appointment with anaesthetist (to assess anaesthetic risks)</li><li>Appointment with transplant surgeon (to take consent for the surgery)</li><li>Final series of blood tests&nbsp;</li><li>One week prior to the surgery, a member of the ADC caught COVID-19, and the ADC was therefore postponed. &nbsp;It was subsequently rearranged for 7 weeks after the original date and necessitated a further series of blood tests one week prior to the new date.</li></ul><h3><strong>The surgery</strong></h3><ul><li>I was admitted to hospital on the morning of the surgery, had spinal and general anaesthetics, and underwent a laparoscopic left nephrectomy.&nbsp; The surgery took 2.5 hours as planned, encountered no complications, and involved four incisions (three 1cm port sites \u2013 at umbilicus, above umbilicus, and below-left of umbilicus \u2013 and an 8cm horizontal midline incision in the underwear waistband to retrieve the organ).</li><li>I spent three nights in hospital after the surgery, during which I required decreasing oral analgesia, became increasingly mobile, had the urinary catheter removed, and regained my appetite.&nbsp; I was discharged when I was able to eat, drink, urinate, mobilise and care for myself without assistance, and was provided with a small supply of analgesia, laxatives and blood-thinning injections to take home.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3><strong>The recovery</strong></h3><ul><li>The biggest problems were caused by pain, abdominal swelling, tiredness and constipation.&nbsp; These improved significantly and became much less problematic within the first 5-7 days.</li><li>One week after the surgery (the day of this post) I\u2019m able to slowly walk numerous miles without problems, but continue to follow the advice to avoid driving and heavy lifting for at least the next week.&nbsp; Potential complications, such as wound infections and deep vein thromboses, have thankfully been avoided.</li><li>I receive weekly follow-up phone calls from the Living Donor Nurse, and have direct access to the surgical ward if needed. &nbsp;I\u2019m due to have a follow-up appointment with the surgeon four weeks after the operation.&nbsp; Beyond this, I shall receive routine annual follow-up from the Renal team.</li><li>The appropriate amount of time off work after the operation depends on the nature of one's job.&nbsp; The surgical team could provide a \u2018sick note\u2019 (a medical certificate that signals non-fitness for work and initiates sickness payments from the individual's employer) for up to six weeks. &nbsp;I\u2019m a self-employed GP, so am largely desk-based and ineligible for sickness payments, so I hope to return to work two weeks after the operation.</li><li>The UKLKSS allows for reimbursement of basic expenses, such as those spent on travel to and from hospital appointments, if they are requested by the donor.</li></ul><h2>Some reflections on my experience&nbsp;</h2><h3><strong>ADC and effectiveness</strong></h3><p>My ADC allowed three donations to take place, while only one would have occurred had I not been matched into an ADC.&nbsp; However, I did not have direct control over this outcome.&nbsp; While the UKLKSS is designed to maximise the number of donations made possible by NDADs, many altruistic donors are matched directly with an individual on the national waiting list who is not in a linked donor-recipient pair, meaning these donors do not form ADCs and their donations only generate single transplantations.&nbsp; NDADs matched in this way have the option to not proceed with their direct donation, and instead wait for the next LDKMR in which they may be matched into an ADC.&nbsp; While this would obviously generate a more effective outcome, denying the original recipient a much-needed kidney presents its own ethical challenges.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Timescale</strong></h3><p>Due to a series of factors, including the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic (which temporarily suspended the UKLKSS), my donation process was substantially delayed multiple times.&nbsp; Absent any postponements, it is likely that the entirety of the process could have been completed within 12-18 months.</p><h3><strong>No pressure to proceed</strong></h3><p>I waited for two years after the first appointment before remaking contact with the Team to proceed with the process.&nbsp; During this time the Team made no attempt to contact me, and the decision to initiate contact and proceed with the process was entirely my own and was not subjected to undue pressure from the Team.</p><p>I chose to suspend the process when my Mum was diagnosed with a terminal illness.&nbsp; The Team were entirely understanding and supportive of this decision, and allowed me to contact them again once I was ready to continue with the process.&nbsp; Again, I felt no undue pressure from the Team to donate.</p><h3><strong>Repeated investigations</strong></h3><p>Due to delays in the process, some of the appointments and investigations exceeded their 'use by dates' and therefore had to be repeated, including that with the renal consultant, and the CT scan, ECG and numerous blood tests.</p><h3><strong>Identity kept confidential</strong></h3><p>The identities of all those involved in the ADC \u2013 all recipients and donors \u2013 were kept confidential throughout the process.&nbsp; Other than the facts that they needed a replacement kidney and live in the UK, I am privy to no details of my kidney's recipient.&nbsp; The recipient has the option to write a letter to be forwarded to me by the Team, in which they can reveal any aspect of their identity if they so wish, but they are under no obligation to do so (I do not have the option to send a letter to the recipient, as per the UKLKSS policy).</p><h3><strong>Publicity</strong></h3><p>I chose to publicise my donation to raise public awareness of the potential for individuals to donate a kidney to a stranger.&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.giveakidney.org\">Give A Kidney</a> is the official partner charity for the UKLKSS and assists willing altruistic donors in producing and distributing press releases regarding their donations.&nbsp; I\u2019m awaiting numerous media interviews as a result of this.&nbsp; I also shared my donation on my personal Twitter and Facebook profiles.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "RichArmitage"}}, {"_id": "aEfhuBDqb8MrCh2fX", "title": "What concrete steps have been taken after Kathleen Forths Suicide?

Especially beef has a high a carbon footprint, measured in terms of kilogram CO2-equivalents per kilogram of meat. Switching from beef to chicken meat or insect meat lowers greenhouse gas emissions and hence decreases future climate change damages. But chicken meat has a much higher moral footprint (Saja, 2013) or welfare footprint (welfarefootprint.org) than beef. Chickens experience more intense suffering and more hours of suffering for one kilogram of meat, compared to beef cows.&nbsp;</p><p>This article shows that the increase in moral footprint when switching from beef to chicken meat or insect meat is likely to be worse than the decrease in carbon footprint. To compare these footprint changes, all the footprints are expressed in terms of the deathprint: the number of humans dying prematurely from climate change and the number of animals killed (slaughtered) in animal farming, for the production of one unit of meat.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>The deathprint of climate change</h2><p>A recent study (Bressler, 2021) estimated the net number of humans dying prematurely from temperature changes (especially heat waves) due to climate change, before the year 2100. An extra emission of 4000 ton CO2, emitted today, results in one extra human death due to climate change, in the business as usual scenario where everyone else does not take measures to reduce their emissions. Hence,&nbsp;0,00000025 humans will be killed this century by emitting one extra kilogram of CO2.</p><p>I use this number of deaths for the calculations below, although this number is both an underestimation and overestimation of the total human deaths due to climate change. It is an underestimation, because it does not include deaths from e.g. famines, wars, infectious diseases, floods and other risks that are increased by climate change. On the other hand, this number is an overestimation in the sense that climate change adaptation measures and CO2 emission reduction measures are likely to be taken. If poor countries develop and become richer, people in those countries can take more adaptive measures such as installing air conditioning, which lowers the mortality rate from extreme temperatures. And if global CO2 emissions are reduced, the impact of an extra unit of CO2 emissions (i.e. the marginal mortality rate) reduces as well (due to the non-linear relationship between amount of CO2 in the atmosphere and climate damages).<a href=\"#_edn1\">[i]</a>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>The deathprint of meat</h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The table below shows the amount of meat produced by one animal, and the carbon footprints of meat products. These footprints measure the greenhouse gas emissions, in terms of CO2-equivalents, including all life cycle emissions as well as land use change emissions from e.g. deforestation, for the production of one kilogram of meat. The values of beef, pork and chicken are taken from Pieper e.a. (2020), which applies to Germany. The carbon footprint of insect meat is assumed to be lower than the footprint of chicken meat but slightly higher than the footprint of plant-based protein. The chosen value is a preliminary estimate of cricket meat, taken from Blonk e.a. (2008).

Most people believe that most farm animals, especially chickens, have lives not worth living, with more negative than positive experiences, dominated by suffering over pleasure (Espinoza &amp; Treich, 2021; Bruers, 2022). In contrast, climate change is unlikely to become so terrible that it causes future humans to have lives not worth living. This means the \u2018100.000 animals to 1 human\u2019 ratio is an underestimation of the overall disvalue (badness) of a present-day chicken suffering on a farm and being killed in a slaughterhouse relative to a future human dying from climate change.

Switching from beef to insect meat would be good overall if you value an insect life as less than one in a billion of a human life. If you value the life of a chicken as less than one in 200 of a cow\u2019s life, switching from beef to chicken meat is net beneficial for the animals.

Almost all people are affected to some degree by the age of 65.</p></blockquote><p>For those of you wondering why you do not develop any symptoms even with advanced atherosclerosis:</p><blockquote><p>Atherosclerosis is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymptomatic\">asymptomatic</a> for decades because the arteries enlarge at all plaque locations, thus there is no effect on blood flow. Even most <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulnerable_plaque\">plaque ruptures</a> do not produce symptoms until enough narrowing or closure of an artery, due to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrombus\">clots</a>, occurs. Signs and symptoms only occur after severe narrowing or closure impedes blood flow to different organs enough to induce symptoms. Most of the time, patients realize that they have the disease only when they experience other <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_disease\">cardiovascular disorders</a> such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke\">stroke</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myocardial_infarction\">heart attack</a>. These symptoms, however, still vary depending on which artery or organ is affected.</p></blockquote><h1>Part 2: Cholesterol and apoB</h1><p>The plaque that builds up in the arterial walls is made up of cholesterol, fat, blood cells and other substances. That is why people talk about their cholesterol, when they talk about atherosclerosis, stroke and heart disease. Before we make cholesterol the absolute bad guy, it is important to keep in mind that cholesterol in itself is not problematic at all, in fact cholesterol is an essential building block for all your cells. But when it is being transported through the arteries by lipoproteins they can get stuck in your arterial walls.</p><p>Historically doctors would focus on your low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), because they were the best predictor for atherosclerosis. This has resulted in LDL-C being called your \"bad cholesterol.\"</p><p>In practice when you send in your blood sample to get your LDL-C levels, they're actually testing your total cholesterol (C), your HDL-C (high density) and triglycerides (T). Using that information they estimate your LDL-C levels with a formula like this:&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:48.49%\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/v1669740376/mirroredImages/moozEANwAFWaD7moB/dtkhkzh387dpukwcowwl.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/1a10b8783698097c66b36e29416f3068da5d90ee58c15e43.png/w_100 100w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/1a10b8783698097c66b36e29416f3068da5d90ee58c15e43.png/w_200 200w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/1a10b8783698097c66b36e29416f3068da5d90ee58c15e43.png/w_300 300w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/1a10b8783698097c66b36e29416f3068da5d90ee58c15e43.png/w_400 400w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/1a10b8783698097c66b36e29416f3068da5d90ee58c15e43.png/w_500 500w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/1a10b8783698097c66b36e29416f3068da5d90ee58c15e43.png/w_600 600w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/1a10b8783698097c66b36e29416f3068da5d90ee58c15e43.png/w_700 700w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/1a10b8783698097c66b36e29416f3068da5d90ee58c15e43.png/w_800 800w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/1a10b8783698097c66b36e29416f3068da5d90ee58c15e43.png/w_900 900w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/rQvD3VnunXZu34m86e5f/images/1a10b8783698097c66b36e29416f3068da5d90ee58c15e43.png/w_938 938w\"></figure><p>Why? Because it is cheaper and as far as I understand it, it works equally well to actually measuring LDL-C. &nbsp;</p><p>There is also evidence that the presence of very low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) is a factor for atherosclerosis. These particles carry mostly triglycerides and contain lower levels of cholesterol compared to LDL-C. In practice VLDL levels are hard to measure and therefore triglyceride levels are used as an indicator of VLDL due to their high triglyceride content.</p><p>This is also why there is strong evidence that it is be better to look at your non-HDL-C (total cholesterol - HDL-C), than at your LDL-C, when predicting ASCVD.&nbsp;</p><p>Recently there seems to be a lot of evidence that there is a better way of measuring both VLDL and LDL-C by measuring your apolipoprotein B (apoB) levels. Lipoproteins like VLDL and LDL are complex particles build of many proteins, but they are organized by exactly one apolipoprotein B.</p><p>Where LDL-C is an indicator of the total volume of the \"bad cholesterol\" and the triglyceride is an indicator of the volume of the VLDL bound triglycerides, apoB is an indicator of the particle count of the LDL-C and VLDL both put together. This is great, because it seems that the count of the particles is a better predictor of ASCVD than the volume of LDL-C and triglycerides. Resulting in one number, that not only incorporates information about both particles, but also more relevant information.</p><p>To make this last point a little clearer: LDL can bind a varying amount of cholesterol, which means that the same volume of LDL-C doesn't necessarily contain the same amount of particles. The same goes for VLDL and it seems that the particle count is the better predictor of atherosclerosis than the volume.</p><p>That measuring apoB is the smarter thing to do is not controversial\u2014at least in Europe.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The 2019 European Society of Cardiology/European Atherosclerosis Society Guidelines concluded that apolipoprotein B (apoB) was a more accurate measure of cardiovascular risk and a better guide to the adequacy of lipid lowering than low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Also, they stated that apoB can be measured more accurately than LDL-C or non-HDL-C.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgjqo1brasvv\"><sup><a href=\"#fngjqo1brasvv\">[2]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>In practice, if you would go to your doctor and ask them to test for your risk of atherosclerosis, it is very unlikely that they would do it by measuring your apoB levels\u2014even in Europe. But you can ask them to measure your apoB; it is not a very expensive test, they might look at you weirdly, but they probably don't have a problem doing it.</p><h2>Measuring apoB, does it really make a difference?</h2><p>How much of a difference does measuring your apoB levels really make? Using that as a predictor instead of LDL-C or non-HDL-C? <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.110.959247\">A Meta-Analysis of Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol, Non-High-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol, and Apolipoprotein B as Markers of Cardiovascular Risk</a> came to the following conclusion:</p><blockquote><p>We calculated the number of clinical events prevented by a high-risk treatment regimen of all those &gt;70th percentile of the US adult population using each of the 3 markers. Over a 10-year period, a non-HDL-C strategy would prevent 300 000 more events than an LDL-C strategy, whereas an apoB strategy would prevent 500 000 more events than a non-HDL-C strategy.</p></blockquote><p>The reason for this big difference is that many patients that achieve their recommended LDL-C goals still develop cardiovascular disorders, which is also known as <i>residual risk.</i> Apparently focusing on apoB eliminates part of that residual risk.</p><p>The <i>Air Force/Texas Coronary Atherosclerosis Prevention Study</i> exemplifies this perfectly in a cohort of 6605 patients. Before treatment both LDL-C and apoB are good predictors of major coronary events. After one year of treatment focused on LDL-C levels, their LDL-C levels stopped being predictive for a future major coronary event (<i>P</i>=.162), but their apoB levels were still a strong predictor (<i>P</i>=.001).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsm5n21i6t5j\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsm5n21i6t5j\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><h2>Papers mostly use LDL-C \ud83d\ude14</h2><p>Although apoB is superior the LDL-C, most papers don't have apoB values available. In those cases I will be referring to LDL-C levels. They are highly correlated so that should be fine.</p><h1><strong>Part 3: Diagnosis</strong></h1><h2><strong>The golden standard for treatment: 10-year risk</strong></h2><p>The current standard for deciding if you need treatment is by estimating the 10-year cardiovascular risk of an individual. There are different ways of calculating this, the most popular one is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Framingham_Risk_Score\">Framingham Risk Score</a>.</p><p>Your score will give the probability that people in a similar cohort get a cardiac event within the next ten years. If this number is above a certain threshold the doctor will decide to start your treatment. For instance, the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_for_Health_and_Clinical_Excellence\">National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence</a> (NICE) recommends statin treatment for adults with an estimated 10 year risk that is greater than 10%.</p><p>There is an obvious flaw that comes with this standard. Your treatment will only start after you have spend the last three decades developing atherosclerosis and you're well on your way towards an arterial event.&nbsp;</p><p>There do exist tools to estimate your lifetime risk, <a href=\"https://tools.acc.org/ldl/ascvd_risk_estimator/index.html#!/calulate/estimator/\">like this one</a> and you can have a lifetime risk of 39-70% while also having a 10-year risk &lt;10%.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefeww4xnswbcd\"><sup><a href=\"#fneww4xnswbcd\">[4]</a></sup></span></p><h2><strong>Causal exposure model of vascular disease&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>For a disease that takes 40 years to develop we start treatment surprisingly late and we have to wonder if earlier treatment is worth the investment. As mentioned above, there are tools to estimate your lifetime risk, but they're not used in practice.&nbsp;</p><p>But before we discuss the topic of early treatment, I want to share a way of thinking about lifetime risk that is called the <i>causal exposure model of vascular disease</i><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefeamz5odto6v\"><sup><a href=\"#fneamz5odto6v\">[5]</a></sup></span>. The main insight of this model is that we shouldn't let the variable \"age\" do most of the lifting, as is the case in the current models. Instead we should estimate a large part of our risk based on the duration of exposure to negative variables.&nbsp;</p><p>Specifically they're:</p><ul><li>level of apoB \u00d7 duration of time the arterial wall is exposed to the apoB lipoproteins&nbsp;(this has to do with cholesterol, more on this in the next section)</li><li>level of blood pressure \u00d7 duration of time the arterial wall is exposed to blood pressure</li><li>intensity of smoking \u00d7 duration of smoking&nbsp;</li><li>duration of diabetes&nbsp;</li><li>non-modifiable&nbsp;risk factors due to aging</li></ul><p>Sadly, as I understand it, this formula is a hypothetical, because the data simply isn't available to estimate the coefficients.&nbsp;</p><p>There is quite some evidence that this model holds. For instance, a paper from 2006 called, <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa054013\"><i>Sequence Variations in PCSK9, Low LDL, and Protection against Coronary Heart Disease</i></a>, looks at the presence of mutations in a gene called PCSK9 which is associated with a lowered LDL-C and apoB. Black participants had a 28 percent reduction in mean LDL-C and an 88 percent reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8333vkftzq3\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8333vkftzq3\">[6]</a></sup></span>. White participants had a 15 percent reduction in LDL-C and a 47 percent reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease.&nbsp;</p><p>A 15% reduction in LDL-C can be considered a mild lifetime reduction in LDL-C, because treatment targets for LDL-C when patients are at risk are often far lower. To compare, the black population with a mutation had a mean LDL-C of 100mg/dL, the white population 115mg/dL and a common treatment target is 70mg/dL.</p><h1><strong>Part 4: Treatment</strong></h1><h2><strong>Indicators and targets</strong></h2><p>As we have seen in Part 3 there are four variables that you want to optimize to prevent ASCVD:</p><ol><li><strong>apoB (LDL-C)</strong></li><li><strong>blood pressure</strong></li><li><strong>diabetes</strong></li><li><strong>smoking</strong></li></ol><p>There is probably something to be said for adding more variables, but for the sake of simplicity and ease of use, I will leave it at this. This should capture the majority of the risk for atherosclerosis in the case of prevention.</p><p>Going forward I will only highlight what to do about apoB levels, because this is what I'm most concerned with in myself. My blood pressure is fine, I don't have diabetes and I don't smoke. If you suffer from any of these risk factors, definitely look into them.</p><h2><strong>Lifestyle Interventions&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>I see three primary lifestyle interventions that are worth doing for reducing your apoB. They're worth doing even if you have a low risk of atherosclerosis, because they are generally good. They are:</p><ul><li>Stop smoking (I will not go into this)</li><li>Eat healthy</li><li>Regular exercise</li></ul><h3><strong>Eat healthy: Introducing the Portfolio Diet</strong></h3><p><i>Disclaimer: I'm a little biased when it comes to this diet. Although it is among the most effective diets, there are also other diets worth exploring. &nbsp;</i></p><p>The aim of the Portfolio Diet is to incorporate a portfolio of healthy foods into your diet that lower apoB.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The concept of a portfolio followed the financial strategy of spreading risks and benefits over a range of options to achieve stability, and in the case of a dietary portfolio, to avoid unreasonably large doses of any single component.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0u7b4e1de51m\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0u7b4e1de51m\">[7]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>I really like the concept of building a portfolio. Instead of being a fixed set of recommendations, it acknowledges that our understanding of nutrition is still in its early stages. You're literally hedging your bets! Furthermore, it leaves open the possibility that the optimal portfolio might change in the future, either by adding new categories, setting new targets or removing categories altogether. The only thing that matters is wherever the evidence points.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently the Portfolio Diet consist of four categories: nuts, plant protein, vicious fibre and plant sterols. All of the foods have proven benefits on your LDL-C and apoB levels.

But please keep in mind, it's not all or nothing! Even incorporating parts of the diet is probably worth the investment.</p><p>Meta-analysis show that it is definitely realistic to get a 10-30% reduction in your LDL-C.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefd1hugmkwf6n\"><sup><a href=\"#fnd1hugmkwf6n\">[8]</a></sup></span></p><h3><strong>Regular exercise</strong></h3><p>I won't be going into a lot of depth here. There are many different kinds of exercise, which makes it a big topic to review. Aerobic exercise seems to work the best, but there is also plenty of evidence that strength training and yoga are helpful.&nbsp;</p><p>For me the following strategy makes sense. Do whatever gets you excited to do it regularly\u2014that is the most important thing. It is realistic to expect a 10-15% reduction in your LDL-C.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Statins</strong></h2><p>When doctors talk about apoB lowering medication, they're mostly talking about statins. Statins are also also known as HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, but this doesn't have the same ring to it. There are some alternatives, but this one is definitely the most popular.</p><p>There is this paper called <i>Statin therapy for young adults: A long-term investment worth considering</i><strong> </strong>which makes the following remarks.</p><blockquote><p>Multiple randomized control trials (RCT) performed over multiple decades have demonstrated that statin therapy for primary prevention reduces ASCVD events, including coronary revascularization, myocardial infarction, and coronary heart disease (CHD) mortality [1\u20134]. Subsequent meta-analyses have demonstrated strong evidence for a reduction in cardiovascular mortality with use of statin therapy [5\u20137], including a meta-analysis from the Cholesterol Treatment Trialists\u2019 (CTT) Collaborators which demonstrated a 25% reduction in major vascular events (relative risk [RR] per 1.0mmol/L reduction in LDL-C, 0.75 [95% CI 0.70\u20130.80]), a 15% reduction in vascular mortality (RR 0.85 [95% CI 0.77\u20130.95]) and a 9% reduction in risk for all-cause mortality (RR 0.91 [0.85\u20130.97]) in individuals without established ASCVD [5].</p></blockquote><p>There isn't a lot of data available on long-term use of statins in healthy adults in their 20's and 30's, but it is definitely plausible (likely) that it would increase the benefits given everything we have discussed so far.</p><p>My primary hesitation for jumping right in are the side effects of statins. The same paper has the following to say on this topic.</p><blockquote><p>Despite public perception that statin therapy is associated with a high risk for side effects, when considering data from RCTs, statins have been well tolerated with an excellent safety profile [1\u20134], and studies with longer term follow-up have not shown any evidence of long term adverse effects [34].</p></blockquote><p>So, what are the risks? I'm summarizing from the same paper here as well:</p><ul><li>Muscle and joint pain is most commonly reported, but there is almost no difference with the placebo groups.</li><li>Myopathies (causes significnat muscle pain) occurs at a rate of 11 per 100,000 patient years.</li><li>Rhabdomyolysis (serious muscle complication) occurs at a rate of 3 per 100,000 patient years.</li><li>Developing Type II diabetes. A 9% increase in developing diabetes in trials that had an mean span of 4 years.&nbsp;</li><li>Woman that are interested in becoming pregnant should avoid using them, because this might affect their future child.</li></ul><p>For all of these we don't know how these risks are impacted by long-term use in an otherwise healthy target audience.</p><p>These risks are serious, but they have to be put into perspective with their power to prevent death and other disabilities caused by a major vascular event. The following tradeoff definitely sounds like a good deal to me:</p><ul><li>I might have to take statins for the next 60 year.</li><li>0.66% chance of developing myopathies.</li><li>0.18% chance of developing rhabdomyolysis.</li><li>30% increase in developing diabetes type II.</li><li>In exchange for a 50% reduction in developing major vascular events.</li></ul><p>Is this realistic? It is plausible, but we don't know for sure because doctors don't usually offer treatment for this long.&nbsp;</p><p>A big meta-analysis of 28 randomized controlled trials<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref81yptit1fk4\"><sup><a href=\"#fn81yptit1fk4\">[9]</a></sup></span>, where the median scheduled treatment duration was 4.8 years, comes to the following conclusion:</p><blockquote><p>Overall, we found a 12% (RR 0\u00b788, 95% CI 0\u00b785\u20130\u00b791) proportional reduction in vascular mortality per 1.0 mmol/L reduction in LDL cholesterol.</p></blockquote><p>Those are just the deaths prevented in the short time spans of the trials.</p><h2><strong>Side effects, alternatives and supplements</strong></h2><p>Although statins are great, surprisingly many people discontinue using them because of side effects. These side effects might occur equally often in placebo groups, but that fact doesn't seem to change much in practice.&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to know there are alternatives! Although statins are the most popular form of medication, other medication does exist, for instance ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors.</p><p>There are two other options that are not considered medicine, but supplements. Both are effective, seem safe and are very well tolerated by people with statin-intolerance. They're red yeast rice and burberine.&nbsp;</p><h3>Red yeast rice</h3><p>Red yeast rice is rice overgrown with a mold culture. It apparently has been used in food preparing traditions since 300 BC. The active compounds that makes it work is monacolin K, which is chemical equivalent to lovastatin. So, red yeast rice contains one currently prescribed statin. It also contains 13 other monacolins, which appear to be less effective than monacolin K</p><p>They will lower your LDL-C and apoB by 20-30%.</p><p>There are three things to note:</p><ol><li>Although they're considered safe, they might come with similar side effects to statins. Furthermore, it has been studied less intensive than statins, so there might be unknown long-term side effects.&nbsp;</li><li>There is a lot of variability in monacolin K content between products, in a study comparing 26 brands the quantity ranged more than a 60 fold<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefo48i13yuwi\"><sup><a href=\"#fno48i13yuwi\">[10]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;Sadly, that same study didn't reveal what products were best. &nbsp;</li><li>Some contain citrinin, which is a potential kidney toxin.</li></ol><h3><strong>Berberine</strong></h3><p>Berberine is a bitter-tasting and yellow-colored chemical found in some plants, like for instance barberry. This supplement is surprisingly effective without being considered a medicine. It improves your LDL-C and apoB, but it can also be used in treating diabetes. In fact, its supposed effectiveness is comparable to the popular diabetes drug metformin.&nbsp;</p><p>They will lower your LDL-C and apoB by 10-20%. Berberine might also be interesting to use in combination with a statin, since it uses a different mechanism to address the problem.</p><p>There are three things to note:</p><ol><li>Although they're considered safe, they might come with side effects. Furthermore, it has been studied less intensive than statins, so there might be unknown long-term side effects.&nbsp;</li><li>Don't use them in combination with medication for treating diabetes. It might also have interactions with a list of other medications.</li><li>There is a lot of variability in berberine content between products, in a study comparing 15 brands, nine of them failed to meet the potency standards. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5807210/\">In this article you can find an overview of all the brands.</a></li></ol><h2><strong>Possible recommendations for early treatment&nbsp;</strong></h2><p><i>Statin therapy for young adults: A long-term investment worth considering </i>gives the following advice.</p><blockquote><p>As an initial step, we recommend considering both traditional and non-traditional risk factors, and calculation of lifetime risk of ASCVD with a lifetime risk \u2265 39% considered to be elevated risk [8,18,20].</p></blockquote><p>The cut off point of 39% might seem a little arbitrary, but it requires you to have at least one major risk factor (smoking, stage 2 hypertension or total cholesterol \u0002240 mg/dL).</p><p>Before we continue, let's put this into perspective.</p><blockquote><p>The lifetime risk for developing clinically manifest coronary disease (angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, coronary insufficiency, or death from coronary heart disease) at age 40 years is approximately 50% for men and 32% for women.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefs0xbgx7kvx\"><sup><a href=\"#fns0xbgx7kvx\">[11]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>Assuming that you have this elevated lifetime risk, they come with the following recommendations:</p><ul><li><strong>In your 20's: </strong>focus on achieving and maintaining healthy lifestyle behaviors with statin use largely limited to those with evidence of familial hypercholesterolemia (genetic<strong> </strong>disorder<strong>)</strong>.</li><li><strong>In your 30's:</strong> In addition to reinforcing the importance of healthy lifestyle behaviors, low to moderate intensity statin therapy can be offered to patients who place significant value in reducing their future ASCVD risk.</li><li><strong>In your 40's:</strong> For individuals at low 10-year risk, in addition to reinforcing the importance of healthy lifestyle behaviors, low to moderate intensity statin therapy to individuals who place greater value on reducing their risk and have a low disutility from statin therapy. Those hesitant, should do a Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) test to help personalize their risk assessment. Low to moderate intensity statin therapy recommended for individuals found to have premature CAC.</li></ul><h1>Part 5: Early treatment as an EA cause?</h1><p>To be honest, when I started writing this article, I hadn't planned on a Part 5 or cross posting it to the EA forum. Posting on LessWrong is scary enough. But this might be a decent EA cause. Which is funny, because when I think of foundations that are definitely not EA, I think of the Heart Foundation.</p><h2><strong>Scale</strong></h2><p>It is the number one cause of death and disability in the developed world. We're talking about 523 million cases of cardiovascular disease and 18.6 million deaths in 2019.<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/e44PgbngLaAKrrxgj/preventing-atherosclerosis-the-easiest-way-to-improve-your-1#fnn9jsl20d35l\"><sup>[1]</sup></a>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Neglectedness</strong></h2><p>There are two things that are currently neglected:</p><ol><li>The use of apoB as an indicator of atherosclerosis by doctors.&nbsp;</li><li>Early treatment of atherosclerosis. The standard is to base treatment on a patients 10-year risk.</li></ol><h2><strong>Tractability</strong></h2><p>For the majority of people the tools for preventing ASCVD already exist. We don't need to develop a cure. People in high income countries don't need funding to pay for their treatment. It's just a different treatment strategies.&nbsp;</p><p>Intuitively I would guess that a campaign focused on doctors can make them start using apoB as an indicator of atherosclerosis. How much this would cost to achieve I don't know. But the threshold for changing their behavior should be incredibly low, in the case of an insured patient they only need to tick an extra box on the laboratory form. The evidence is strong for this one!</p><p>Early treatment seems much harder. Although, at this point I'm in favor of early treatment, we need clarity on this issue, there is still limited evidence. How this problem should be resolved is a complex topic, because lifetime trials are very hard to do. Even if we start today, by the time we get the results, billions might have died unnecessarily.&nbsp;</p><h1>My strategy going forward</h1><h2><strong>Testing</strong></h2><p>I am planning to get tested on a regular basis; at least once a year, using both the standard cholesterol measurements and apoB levels, logging them carefully as they might come in handy in the future when we know more.</p><p>In periods when I'm playing around with treatment strategies, I will measure every three months to see if my strategy is working.&nbsp;</p><p>In my 40s I will do a Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) test. In the case of premature CAC I might consider more intensive treatments.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Targets</strong></h2><p>I'm aiming for the following target:</p><ul><li>ApoB: <strong>\u2264</strong>80mg/dL,&nbsp;</li><li>LDL-C: <strong>\u2264</strong>100mg/dL.</li></ul><p>Both will put me in the 20th Framingham Offspring Study population percentile, which is low but not that extreme. These numbers also correspond to the group that had a mutation in their PCSK9 gene which greatly reduced their risk of ASCVD.&nbsp;</p><p>These are pretty ambitious targets\u2014so I might reconsider this in the future.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Treatment</strong></h2><p>I'm planning to do all my treatment under the supervision of my doctor. Even though I consider the treatments worth the risk, it doesn't make sense to adopt them carelessly.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>First line of defense</strong></p><ul><li>Stop smoking (I don't smoke, so this is easy)</li><li>Portfolio Diet (10 - 30% reduction, depending on adherence)</li><li>Regular exercise, (10-15% reduction, depending on adherence)</li></ul><p><strong>Second line of defense</strong></p><ul><li>Statins (30-70% reduction)</li></ul><p>Or if I have too many side effect, then I can use a \"natural\" alternative:</p><ul><li>Red yeast rice (20-30% reduction)</li><li>Berberine (10-20% reduction)</li></ul><p>All these options are considered safe and effective, but for the natural alternatives there is only limited data available. For none of these there is long-term data available.&nbsp;</p><p>There is also the option of combining statins with berberine, because berberine has a different mechanism to address the problem.</p><p><strong>Third line of defense</strong></p><p>If this doesn't have the preferred result, then there are further options to explore in collaboration with my doctor.</p><h2><strong>Closing remarks</strong></h2><p>I'm not an expert in this field and I wrote this article to explore my own treatment options. I can't recommend you follow my lead. I'm definitely willing to change my view on this topic, I didn't even know about it until three weeks ago.

But to do good you need resources, and some of those will be in limited supply. If you use scarce resources, that means someone else won't. Now they can't do as much good as they could've. So how should you decide which scarce resources to use, or whether to use them at all?</p>\n<p>Replaceability is a partial answer to this. Replaceability is usually taken to mean something like \"the extent to which someone else would do what you'd do in a job if you don't take the job\". I interpret it more generally, as \"the extent to which other people would've produced similar value with a scarce resource had you not used it\".<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-aF9AXKQcXDeK9tvad-1\" id=\"fnref-aF9AXKQcXDeK9tvad-1\">[1]</a></sup></p>\n<p>The paradigmatic example is choosing a career: if you're thinking of becoming a doctor to save hundreds of lives, you should perhaps keep in mind that <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2012/09/how-many-lives-does-a-doctor-save-part-3-replacement-84/\">someone else might've saved those lives</a> had you chosen a different career. If so, the doctor profession is highly replaceable. But this is just one of many situations where replaceability may be a factor:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Decision</th>\n<th>Scarce resource</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Choosing a job</td>\n<td>Salary, opportunities for direct impact and support from employer and colleagues</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Asking someone to be a mentor</td>\n<td>Mentor's time and energy</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Applying for a grant</td>\n<td>Grant, grantmaker's time and grantmaker's connections</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Marketing a resource to the community</td>\n<td>Prestige and community attention</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Four Views on Impact</h2>\n<p>We can look at impact in at least four different ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>The naive view.</strong> Your impact is the value you produced directly and indirectly using some amount of resources.\n<ul>\n<li>This view, which I think is common outside effective altruism, is incorrect because it fails to consider the counterfactual.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>The single comparison view.</strong> Your impact is the value you produced directly and indirectly using some amount of resources, minus the value someone else would've produced using those same resources had you not done so.\n<ul>\n<li>This view, which I think is common within effective altruism, is incorrect because it fails to consider trickle-down effects. That is, the person who replaces you would've been replaced by someone less able, who in turn would've been replaced by someone less able, and so on. Each of these steps may involve an additional loss of impact.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>The replacement view.</strong> Your impact is the value you produced directly and indirectly using some amount of resources, minus the value the \"replacement-level person\" of that reference group would've produced using those same resources.\n<ul>\n<li>This is an effective altruist variant of what sabermetricians call <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wins_Above_Replacement\">Wins Above Replacement</a>, a stat that aims to measure how many more wins a baseball player contributes to a team than the replacement-level player. The replacement-level player is the substitute who would've been called up to join the team had the player being measured not participated.</li>\n<li>The replacement view seems confused, at least as a parallel to sports, because in sports it's designed to compare people, not actions.</li>\n<li>Benjamin Todd <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/coordination/#problems-with-a-simple-single-player-approach-and-the-value-of-freed-up-resources\">proposes something similar</a>: that your impact is the value you produce, minus the value someone else would've produced in your position, plus the value of any additionally freed-up resources. But it seems hard to me to estimate the value of those freed-up resources \u2013 it feels like punting.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>The God view.</strong> Your impact is the value produced by everyone (including you) in the world where you use some amount of resources, minus the value that would've been produced by everyone in the world where you didn't use those resources. (Because God is omniscient.)\n<ul>\n<li>This view is perhaps normatively correct but requires perfect information and computing power.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Benjamin Todd, <a href=\"https://rationalaltruist.com/2013/01/22/replaceability/\">Paul Christiano</a> and others have thought and written about replaceability, but I think it's fair to say no one has reached any definitive conclusion: it's a hard problem. Todd <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/ben-todd-on-what-effective-altruism-most-needs/#replaceability-005327\">recommends focusing on other, more robustly predictable factors</a>, like <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/personal-fit/\">personal fit</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/importance\">scale</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/tractability\">solvability</a>, when choosing a career. In fact, there's been remarkably little discussion about replaceability in the past few years, I think partly because people have realised that replaceability differs less across career options than those other things (personal fit, etc.), and partly because people have tactically retreated from a difficult problem.</p>\n<p>I <em>think</em> this is somewhat unfortunate, as replaceability seems to me to be decision-relevant and somewhat tractable, even if not as important as the problems Todd and Christiano have moved on to.</p>\n<h2>Why Does Replaceability Matter?</h2>\n<p>There are ~1M licensed physicians in the US alone, which is ~2 orders of magnitude more than the number of effective altruists globally. I'd expect there to be a difference of \u22651 order of magnitude in the number of people working on different problems within effective altruism too. If the number of people working in a field affects replaceability in a way that matters when estimating counterfactual impact, it seems important to know how it matters.</p>\n<p>To imagine a rather extreme scenario, I think it's easy for someone who's choosing between two jobs, one in a field with lots of people and one that basically only they can do, to have heard of replaceability and think, \"Though this thing that only I can do seems less important than this thing that many other people are doing, if I don't work on the thing that many people are doing, someone else nearly as good as me would take my place, so instead I should work on this thing that only I can do.\" But if something like the replacement view is a better representation of the truth than the single comparison view, this person may be making a grievous error!</p>\n<p>Sports seems somewhat analogous here. Sports teams are also making decisions about how to allocate scarce resources (e.g. playing time), and they do so by explicitly considering replaceability. (It's easier for them; they have good measures of how teams and players perform.)</p>\n<p>For example, suppose a hockey team is deciding whether to sign a star left winger or equally talented star right winger. Suppose currently its top left winger is near star calibre, whereas its top right winger is middling. Suppose its <em>worst</em> left winger is so bad as to be a liability, whereas its worst right winger is pretty good. If the team only compared each potential addition to the player whose spot they'd take, they'd go with the star right winger (who's much better than the currently best right winger on the team, who's middling). But it may be better for the team to sign the star left winger (to get rid of the marginal left winger, who's a liability).<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-aF9AXKQcXDeK9tvad-2\" id=\"fnref-aF9AXKQcXDeK9tvad-2\">[2]</a></sup></p>\n<p>I think it's currently unclear how we are looking or should look at replaceability. My impression is that the single comparison view was circulated once long ago and that, ever since <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/07/replaceability-isnt-as-important-as-you-might-think-or-weve-suggested/\">its flaws became apparent</a>, there's been something of a vacuum. With what do people fill this vacuum? I have no idea. But we make decisions, so it must be something.</p>\n<h2>Simulations</h2>\n<p>I've run Monte Carlo simulations with the aim of seeing how these views perform in four simple, idealised scenarios. The scenarios pit two fields (as in, spheres of activity) against each other. (For more on how the simulations were run, see the Appendix.) The percentages signify how often you'd choose Field A if you took a given view:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>#</th>\n<th>Field A</th>\n<th>Field B</th>\n<th>Naive</th>\n<th>Single Comparison</th>\n<th>Replacement</th>\n<th>God</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1K ppl (medium talent), 100 jobs</td>\n<td>1K ppl (medium talent), 100 jobs</td>\n<td>49.9%</td>\n<td>50.7%</td>\n<td>50.0%</td>\n<td>50.1%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1K ppl (high talent), 100 jobs</td>\n<td>1K ppl (medium talent), 100 jobs</td>\n<td>69.6%</td>\n<td>62.3%</td>\n<td>61.8%</td>\n<td>62.4%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1K ppl (medium talent), 100 jobs</td>\n<td>100 ppl (medium talent), 10 jobs</td>\n<td>50.7%</td>\n<td>26.0%</td>\n<td>53.4%</td>\n<td>49.4%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>1K ppl (medium talent), 100 jobs</td>\n<td>200 ppl (medium talent), 100 jobs</td>\n<td>67.9%</td>\n<td>55.8%</td>\n<td>56.2%</td>\n<td>56.5%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>I interpret the results thusly:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The fields are identical so the decision is a toss-up. Indeed, all four views choose Field A ~50% of the time.</li>\n<li>Field A has more talented people than Field B so we should pick it more often. That's because you're drawn randomly from each field's talent pool, so you'll usually end up being more talented in Field A than in Field B.\n<ul>\n<li>Most views capture this pretty well (using the God view as our ground truth), ending up at 62%.\n<ul>\n<li>But the naive view is kind of off at 70%. It's too optimistic about higher-talent fields when jobs are scarce. I think that's because it ignores trickle-down effects. This doesn't matter when everyone has a job \u2013 in that case, the naive view is nearly identical to the replacement view. But when jobs are scarce there's a difference between these, and the difference grows as the overall talent of the field grows.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>People are equally talented in both fields, but Field B has 10% as many people and jobs as Field A.\n<ul>\n<li>This is also a toss-up. The naive (51%) and replacement (53%) views do well here with the God view (49%) as ground truth.\n<ul>\n<li>But the single comparison view does poorly (26%). It's too optimistic about fields with fewer people since the distance to the next most talented person will tend to be larger there. But this distance doesn't matter much if there's a trickle-down effect.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>People are equally talented in both fields, but Field B has fewer people relative to its number of jobs (2x) than does Field A (10x).\n<ul>\n<li>This isn't a toss-up \u2013 we should choose Field A 57% of the time. That's because we stipulated that you're always in a position to choose between the two fields, meaning, because there are fewer people for each job in Field B, a randomly chosen person who gets a job there is less talented than a randomly chosen person who gets a job in Field A (which is more competitive). So we'll tend to pick Field A more.\n<ul>\n<li>The single comparison (56%) and replacement (56%) views do well here.\n<ul>\n<li>But the naive view does poorly (68%). It's too pessimistic about fields where there's less competition in the labour market, though I'm not sure why.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Like any model, this one rests on a number of simplifying assumptions. None of these results are guaranteed to hold outside the model's world. Still ...</p>\n<h2>The Replacement View Seems Useful, Maybe</h2>\n<p>Though I don't feel sure enough to actually make recommendations to people faced with career decisions, <strong>I'm tentatively bullish on the replacement view</strong>. Arguments for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>There may be serious failure modes for both the naive and single comparison views.</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>If we trust the simulations, the naive view seems too bullish on fields with better candidates, and also too bearish on fields with less competition on the labour market. The single comparison view is too bullish on fields with fewer people and jobs (even if the people-to-jobs ratio is constant).</li>\n<li>If we don't trust the simulations, there still seem to be intuitive issues like not considering counterfactuals at all (the naive view) and not considering trickle-down effects (the single comparison view).</li>\n<li>I don't know of any practical alternatives to these views. I have come across considerations that seem important and have to do with replaceability, but no action-guiding frameworks or theories.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>These same failure modes may not affect the replacement view.</strong> The replacement view does well in the simulations, though I wouldn't put too much weight on that. It also just takes into account counterfactuals as well as trickle-down effects, which seems good.</li>\n<li><strong>It seems workable.</strong> I think people often have a pretty good idea of what the replacement-level person in their field looks like, either from studying with people who wouldn't or who would only barely break into the field, or from working with them, or from seeing the things they produce. If one hasn't worked or studied in a field, one can still get a pretty good impression by talking with people in the field, or reading about it, or, again, seeing the things people in the field produce.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Arguments against:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It seems unworkable.</strong> It's unclear which reference group to use when locating the replacement-level person. Say you're a wild animal welfare researcher. Is the correct reference group all wild animal welfare researchers? Is it all animal welfare researchers? Is it all impact-focused animal welfare researchers? Is it impact-focused people period? Or something else?</li>\n<li><strong>It seems conceptually confused.</strong> I don't have a mathematical proof for the replacement view. It isn't, as far as I know, solidly grounded in economic or moral theory.\n<ul>\n<li>In sports, stats like Wins Above Replacement are used to compare the impact of people, not the impact of actions. (Choosing which player to sign is an action, but I'm not sure whether the assumptions hold if you look at it that way.) That makes me suspicious of simply transposing it over to career decisions.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Maybe thinking about replaceability is getting too in the weeds when we still haven't figured out more important considerations.</strong> It seems likely to me that factors like how pressing a problem is, career capital and so on are substantially more important than replaceability. Maybe those factors swamp replaceability, such that it's basically not worth thinking about when you could instead be thinking about those other things?</li>\n<li><strong>Maybe replaceability is subsumed by personal fit.</strong> If personal fit is the distance between a candidate and the average candidate, it's analogous to the replacement view, which is the distance between a candidate and the replacement-level candidate. These measures should correlate. I think the way they differ depends on how talent is distributed.\n<ul>\n<li>They both help you predict how much effort you add to a problem.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-aF9AXKQcXDeK9tvad-3\" id=\"fnref-aF9AXKQcXDeK9tvad-3\">[3]</a></sup> (They don't say anything about scale or solvability.) So maybe we only need one of them.\n<ul>\n<li>However, when I ran the same simulations with a \"personal fit view\", it picked the wrong thing \u226530% of runs in scenario (2) and \u226517% of runs in scenario (4). Maybe the right framing is something like \"we should start thinking of personal fit as not comparing ourselves to the average, but comparing ourselves to the replacement level\"?</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>My simulation code may be buggy.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Replaceability is also more complicated than this post makes it out to be. For example, in the real world:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>It can take time for changes to percolate down</strong>, unlike in sports where an empty position must be filled immediately. A company may not immediately find a replacement, if it does at all.\n<ul>\n<li>Perhaps the model could include a probability P that some person will take a job had one not taken it, as Benjamin Todd does <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/coordination/#problems-with-a-simple-single-player-approach-and-the-value-of-freed-up-resources\">here</a>. This probability would depend on how many candidates there are, how talented they are, how broadly openings are advertised and so on. These factors surely differ from field to field.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Employers don't always hire the best candidates.</strong> However, I expect them to choose the better candidate more often than not, so maybe it's correct to say that they hire the best candidates in expectation.</li>\n<li><strong>People don't always know what they're a good fit for.</strong> That means one may end up displacing someone into a career where they end up doing much <em>more</em> good. But again, I expect people to have a pretty clear picture most of the time of how good they'd be at a thing.</li>\n<li><strong>Talent may not be lognormally distributed.</strong> I'm pretty sure it follows a heavy-tailed distribution (that seems to be the case in <a href=\"https://evolving-hockey.com/blog/wins-above-replacement-replacement-level-decisions-results-and-final-remarks-part-3/\">hockey</a>, <a href=\"https://www.beyondtheboxscore.com/2012/5/23/3038977/wins-above-replacement-distribution-and-rarity-of-talent-2011\">baseball</a>, <a href=\"http://blog.webfoot.com/2008/11/03/programmer-productivity-update/\">programming</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/economicoutputandproductivity/productivitymeasures/articles/labourproductivitymeasuresfromtheannualbusinesssurvey/2006to2015#results\">labour in the UK</a><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-aF9AXKQcXDeK9tvad-4\" id=\"fnref-aF9AXKQcXDeK9tvad-4\">[4]</a></sup>), but it's not clear to me which one, and this may make a difference.</li>\n<li><strong>Choosing to use a scarce resource <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/ben-todd-on-what-effective-altruism-most-needs/#replaceability-005327\">may increase or decrease the supply of that resource</a></strong> (on top of the amount one used), and the degree to which this happens can vary from field to field. For example, if more people try to be doctors, hospitals can pay them lower salaries, meaning they have more money to spend (assuming the labour market for doctors has non-zero supply and demand elasticities).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The problem that replaceability is meant to address is a pretty rare one. There doesn't seem to be much research on it. There aren't that many situations where people (1) pursue the same goal<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-aF9AXKQcXDeK9tvad-5\" id=\"fnref-aF9AXKQcXDeK9tvad-5\">[5]</a></sup>, (2) don't usually coordinate, (3) use shared scarce resources with substantial supply and demand and (4) are able to use those resources to varying degrees of efficiency. But effective altruists are in this rare situation.</p>\n<h2>Appendix: Monte Carlo Simulations</h2>\n<p>Here is the procedure I used to simulate career choices based on the four replaceability views:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>For two different fields, Field A and Field B, generate N people with different Talent Levels, and M jobs with different \"Effort Multipliers\".<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-aF9AXKQcXDeK9tvad-6\" id=\"fnref-aF9AXKQcXDeK9tvad-6\">[6]</a></sup> Assume these are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution\">lognormally distributed</a>.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-aF9AXKQcXDeK9tvad-7\" id=\"fnref-aF9AXKQcXDeK9tvad-7\">[7]</a></sup>\n<ul>\n<li>Effort Multipliers represent the fact that some jobs allow a person to get more work done towards solving a problem than other jobs, e.g. by providing more opportunities or better support.</li>\n<li>We can describe the effort added by a person working a job with the formula Effort = Talent Level \u00d7 Effort Multiplier. So the total effort of people working on a problem (corresponding to the God view) is given by the sum of Talent Level \u00d7 Effort Multiplier for all person-job pairs in both fields. (We assume people who don't get a job produce zero effort.)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>For each field, assign the most talented people to the jobs with the highest Effort Multipliers, one at a time, until there are no more available jobs (or people).</li>\n<li>Select a person at random from each field, excluding those people who didn't get a job.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-aF9AXKQcXDeK9tvad-8\" id=\"fnref-aF9AXKQcXDeK9tvad-8\">[8]</a></sup> This is you and your talent at each thing.

But I think it serves as an example of these kinds of considerations mattering in practice. <a href=\"#fnref-aF9AXKQcXDeK9tvad-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-aF9AXKQcXDeK9tvad-3\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>I frame it as \"how much effort you add\", not \"how much impact you have\", because impact also depends on other things, in particular the problem areas' relative <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/importance\">scale</a> (defined, <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/problem-framework/#top\">after 80,000 Hours</a>, as Good Done \u00f7 % of Problem Solved) and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/tractability\">solvability</a> (% of Problem Solved \u00f7 % Increase in Effort). Focusing on effort alone is cleaner as we can bracket those other concepts. As far as this post is concerned, all problems have the same scale and solvability.</p>\n<p>NB. \"Increase in Effort\" is called by 80,000 Hours \"Increase in Resources\", but since I'm already using the word \"resource\" to refer to labour, time and money, I'm calling it \"Increase in Effort\" instead. <a href=\"#fnref-aF9AXKQcXDeK9tvad-3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-aF9AXKQcXDeK9tvad-4\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Some posts, like <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2019/08/how-replaceable-are-top-candidates-in-large-hiring-rounds/#some-possible-distributions-of-job-performance\">this one</a>, point to income and researcher citation count as evidence of this (emphasis mine): \"<strong>If job performance is like income, or the number of citations people have on academic papers, it is more like a log normal distribution[.]</strong> That is, most aspiring academics have few citations, while some have thousands, tens of thousands, or even hundreds of thousands. [...] We're very unsure about this question, and would like to see more research into it. Some evidence we've seen suggests that output is normally distributed even in 'complex' jobs, like being a doctor. However, for the most difficult and creative work, like academic research, we suspect that the variance is high in the tails. Even there, it's hard to be confident since <strong>many measures of output (such as citation count) are likely to overstate differences in productivity</strong>.\"</p>\n<p>As alluded to in the quoted passage, I think income and citation count aren't good evidence. Even if talent is normally distributed (i.e. follows a bell curve), salary and citations could well have heavy tails due to nonlinear effects later in the causal chain. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_effect\">Matthew effect</a> \u2013 where having an advantage gets you further advantages \u2013 applies here too, as well-cited papers are more likely to get further citations independently of quality, and richer people are more likely to get more money regardless of talent. <a href=\"#fnref-aF9AXKQcXDeK9tvad-4\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-aF9AXKQcXDeK9tvad-5\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Benjamin Todd calls this a <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/coordination/#shared-aim-communities-and-trade-plus\">\"shared aim community\"</a>. <a href=\"#fnref-aF9AXKQcXDeK9tvad-5\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-aF9AXKQcXDeK9tvad-6\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>This model implicitly takes neglectedness and personal fit into account \u2013 neglectedness (and importance) is captured by a job's impact level, and personal fit is captured by a person's talent level. <a href=\"#fnref-aF9AXKQcXDeK9tvad-6\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-aF9AXKQcXDeK9tvad-7\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Page (2018) writes: \"In some cases, we may know the mean of the distribution and also know that all values must be positive.

This is because the benefits in terms of basis points of existential risk reduced are entirely in the future for outreach (in the form of additional researchers) while immediately working on research will bring gains sooner.

However, the two largest components of the increase in capital allocated were primarily in the form of FTX and Facebook stock. With the former now worthless, and the latter having declined to less than one third of its value at the time of the writing of the article, the overall capital stock allocated to EA has plunged in value while the labour stock remains almost unaffected. Using the same methodology as the above article, noting that Dustin Moskovitz\u2019s net worth now only stands at <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/profile/dustin-moskovitz/?sh=78a0c0721dd3\">$6.5 billion</a> at the time of writing, reduces the increase in funding over the past 7 years to $2.95 billion nominally (from a starting level of ~$10 billion), or a real terms increase of only $0.35 billion, or 2.8%: 0.39% annually.

Interestingly, as the annual existential risk probability is low in comparison to the potential difference between capital and labour growth rates, in worlds with very high capital growth compared to labour the discount rate should be negative, so an EA tomorrow should be preferred to one today, as is reflected in the distribution above possessing a long tail with negative discount rates.</p><h3>Other parameter estimation</h3><p>The remaining estimation of marginal value depends on three variables, if individuals are assumed to be recruiting individuals of identical value to themselves: the average number of additional members of EA the typical person devoted to outreach can acquire, the path of individual effectiveness at this over time and the time interval between making an individual available for EA and them providing an impact.&nbsp;</p><p>For the first of these, three programmes seem to provide relevant data: <a href=\"https://www.leaf.courses/\">Leaf 2022</a> is estimated to have produced 9.2 HEAs&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0s46pzdo94x\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0s46pzdo94x\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(Highly Engaged EAs: 90% 0.77 to 22) per FTE (Full-Time Equivalent) year&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref81p42b4fo9\"><sup><a href=\"#fn81p42b4fo9\">[3]</a></sup></span>, while EA Stanford produced perhaps<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/F9E8MwsPLiqSYhXJm/lessons-from-running-stanford-ea-and-seri\"> 6.7 HEAs</a> per FTE year, assuming 1 FTE year from the organiser in question and 0.5 from others: however, as it also worked towards accelerating the careers of those already interested in EA. EA Malaysia appears to have produced <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cCTmHQjDKc5EsK5PJ/ea-malaysia-report-august-2021-january-2022\">1 additional HEA</a> (Cat &gt;3) with 0.2 FTEs worth of inputs, and thus a cost-effectiveness of 5 HEAs per FTE, absent consideration of individuals it moved to below HEA but still impactful level. However, all of these are of course average not marginal costs, so need adjusting to calculate marginal benefit. If the capital elasticity of output is the same as above, then the marginal effect of any given increase in the labour stock are 60% of the current average. However, as EA Stanford had substantial impacts beyond HEA recruitment, raising its value to 10 seems reasonable to model strict optimisation for the task in question here seems reasonable, which assuming the same uncertainty ratios as in Leaf provides an arithmetic mean value of 12.1 HEAs/FTE (90% 0.68 to 18.5) distributed roughly normally. This model assumes a normal distribution of mean 7.26 and standard deviation 2.673&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkm4i7wt2zof\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkm4i7wt2zof\">[4]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;</p><p>For the path of facilitator effectiveness over time, much research, such as <a href=\"https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED480858\">Rice 2003</a> and <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/3592891#metadata_info_tab_contents\">Rockoff 2004</a> find that teacher effectiveness, likely a decent proxy for how convincing facilitators are, is correlated with experience, but with minimal gains after about two years of teaching, implying that facilitator effectiveness is near-flat for the longer-horizons view for the purposes of this blog post, which it will be treated as such for this model. The third of these depends heavily on the type of outreach conducted. If the outreach is assumed to be that which maximises elasticity of career adjustment with respect to inputs, namely to pre-university students, then the impact delay is likely at least 5 years, depending on exact student ages. For the purposes of the model here, a delay of 10 years with a standard deviation of 2 seems reasonable (absent the usage of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gDnGrccLDwGdS8vFj/the-case-for-infant-outreach\">potentially more effective</a> strategies).&nbsp;</p><h3>Results</h3><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669832718/mirroredImages/yeMzJATjqxLioGM6K/eri9fckk3mdvyuncaksa.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1a507c068f2ca40d64975f66184dea5b7d6561dc8d039fd3.png/w_82 82w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1a507c068f2ca40d64975f66184dea5b7d6561dc8d039fd3.png/w_162 162w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1a507c068f2ca40d64975f66184dea5b7d6561dc8d039fd3.png/w_242 242w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1a507c068f2ca40d64975f66184dea5b7d6561dc8d039fd3.png/w_322 322w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1a507c068f2ca40d64975f66184dea5b7d6561dc8d039fd3.png/w_402 402w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/1a507c068f2ca40d64975f66184dea5b7d6561dc8d039fd3.png/w_482 482w\"><figcaption>Figure 2: Log of present value of the marginal individual devoting 30 years to EA outreach in additional HEAs produced.</figcaption></figure><p>Table 1: Distribution of estimates of present value of HEAs produced over 30 year-career in outreach</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Percentile</td><td>Forecast present value in researchers</td></tr><tr><td>0.001</td><td>0.2434889</td></tr><tr><td>0.05</td><td>17.64172</td></tr><tr><td>0.10</td><td>27.89604</td></tr><tr><td>0.25</td><td>51.50568</td></tr><tr><td>0.5</td><td>91.90995</td></tr><tr><td>0.75</td><td>169.2946</td></tr><tr><td>0.90</td><td>370.546</td></tr><tr><td>0.95</td><td>796.4474</td></tr><tr><td>0.999</td><td>7074914</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Table 2: Correlation coefficients between input variables and outputs</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td>Variable</td><td>Correlation with result</td></tr><tr><td>Existential risk probability</td><td>-0.009026162</td></tr><tr><td>Capital growth rate</td><td>0.2246881</td></tr><tr><td>Labour growth rate</td><td>-0.004803998</td></tr><tr><td>Average outreach</td><td>0.002636238</td></tr><tr><td>Impact delay</td><td>0.0006790306</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>These results counterintuitively imply that the current marginal individual would be substantially higher marginal impact working to expand effective altruism than working on maximising the reduction in existential risk today, with 99.7% confidence The most significant uncertainty comes in the form of the capital growth rate which, as the results of the past few months have shown, is extremely volatile and path dependent, and reducing the uncertainty in the long-run path of this would do most for reducing the range of the estimates above.

Intellectual and cultural diversity within GPR is important for several reasons. First, GPR aims to ask political, moral and empirical questions. Answering these questions well requires incorporating a range of perspectives to reduce bias and blindspots. Second, we want the field of GPR to attract the best talent regardless of background.</p><p>We also want to contribute to building a welcoming and diverse effective altruism community.&nbsp; We are impressed by the projects and efforts of Magnify Mentoring and hope to build on their efforts to give everyone interested in effective altruism the same opportunity to reach their potential and contribute to the collective effort of making the biggest difference.</p><p>This will be the second Open Students Workshop in Global Priorities Research. The first was conducted in June 2022 and attended by 23 students. The workshop received very positive feedback from participants.</p><h2><strong>The 2023 Workshop</strong></h2><p>The 2023 Workshop will take place from the 18th to 21st of June 2023 in Oxford. Participants will attend the 12th Oxford Workshop on Global Priorities Research (19th to 20th of June 2023) organised by the Global Priorities Institute. They will also receive personalised 1:1 career- and research-coaching from GPI staff members and other members of the global priorities research community; attend presentations and discussions on global priorities research, career planning and experiences in academic research; and participate in networking and social events.</p><p>Applications are open until <strong>8 January 2023 at midnight GMT</strong>.

I ignore things that would take days or weeks.</p><p>It won\u2019t explore editing, marketing or podcast-building in general. That said, podcasters may find this a useful framework for supporting their guests.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:&nbsp;</strong>I draw upon 2 years of experience as host of a podcast on education (<a href=\"https://anchor.fm/aboutlearning\"><u>link</u></a>) and won\u2019t be citing evidence to back up my claims about what makes a \u201cgood\u201d appearance. For virtually every \u201crule\u201d implied by my advice there is a successful podcast that breaks it - but I believe this guide will&nbsp;<i>generally help guests avoid the main pitfalls&nbsp;</i>and improve the quality of their appearance.</p><h1>What makes a good appearance?</h1><p><strong>A strong start</strong>. Most listeners treat the beginning of a podcast episode as an audition. If it doesn\u2019t \u201cgrab\u201d them, they switch to something else. Hence you should make sure that you start strong. More on this under&nbsp;<i>plan your message &gt;&gt; intro.</i></p><p><strong>To the point.</strong> Unless this is one of those \u201cfun, casual podcasts\u201d, your listeners are here to learn something. Give it to them. The best way to do this is to&nbsp;<i>plan your message</i>.</p><p><strong>Speak clearly</strong>. Improving your public speaking can be a lifelong journey, but there are some things you can address quickly. See below for&nbsp;<i>last-minute speech coaching</i>.</p><p><strong>Enjoy yourself!</strong> Good vibes are contagious. Minimise nerves and talk about stuff you enjoy discussing.</p><p><strong>High-quality audio.&nbsp;</strong>It makes you sound more professional. See below for tips on&nbsp;<i>audio setup</i>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>How to prepare</h1><p>You probably won\u2019t do&nbsp;<i>everything&nbsp;</i>mentioned here. A good strategy may be to:</p><ol><li>Estimate how long each process would take</li><li>Roughly rank them by importance</li><li>Use 1 and 2 to decide which you will actually do and in which order</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Understand the gig</h2><p>Before you prep for your appearance, it is useful to understand:</p><ul><li>Who the podcast\u2019s audience is</li><li>What prior knowledge you can assume</li><li>What the host wishes to get from you as a guest</li><li>Any questions the host knows they want to ask</li></ul><p>Hopefully the host has briefed you on these already. If they haven\u2019t, you may want to ask them directly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Plan your message</h2><p>This varies based on your confidence level. You may want to fully script some responses, or you may be fine with a bullet-point plan. Just&nbsp;<strong>don\u2019t read from a script during the interview</strong>. Unless you\u2019re a competent actor, it sounds wooden.</p><h3>Intro</h3><p>Remember, you want a strong start to avoid losing your audience. Your response to the first question should be under a minute long and should&nbsp;<i>link to your core message&nbsp;</i>(see below).</p><p>If you are asked to introduce yourself or describe your history,&nbsp;<i>keep it snappy.</i> Most people aren\u2019t interested in where you went to school or your first job out of university. If some part of your identity/story is key to your message, mention it but do so briefly. You can always give more detail later, when the on-the-fence listeners have decided to stay with you.</p><p>The intro doesn\u2019t need to be fully planned in advance: it might be a post-it that you stick to your laptop screen before the interview:</p><figure class=\"table\"><table style=\"background-color:hsl(90, 75%, 60%)\"><tbody><tr><td><p>First response:</p><ul><li>Under 60 seconds</li><li>Keep it snappy!</li><li>Link to core message</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>If you&nbsp;<i>do&nbsp;</i>want to plan your intro in advance, make it fun! Build it around an anecdote or a thought experiment or controversial statement that will make people sit up in their seats.</p><figure class=\"table\" style=\"width:666px\"><table style=\"background-color:hsl(0, 0%, 90%)\"><tbody><tr><td><p><strong>A word of caution</strong></p><p>Although keeping the start of the episode \u201csnappy\u201d, even provocative, is a good general rule, we should be aware of the risks of simplifying complex concepts:</p><ul><li>Communicating your ideas in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/blog/the-fidelity-model-of-spreading-ideas\"><u>low-fidelity</u></a> way can (unintentionally) spread damaging misconceptions</li><li>Being provocative or contrarian can trigger a tribal response that hardens people against your ideas</li></ul><p>Podcast guests should&nbsp;<strong>aim to find a balance</strong> between engaging and high-fidelity communication. Make people sit up in their seats, but don\u2019t give your ideas a bad name.</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3>Core message</h3><p>I\u2019ve got news for you: most of your audience is only half-listening. If they only remember one thing about this interview, what should it be?</p><p>Plan your \u201celevator pitch\u201d of under 100 words. You want to allude to this in your very first answer, and cover it fully at some point in the interview. It doesn\u2019t need to be earth shattering and it could even be a single sentence (eg. \u201cwild animal suffering is real suffering\u201d).</p><p>Also plan your broader message. This could be the 3-4 ideas that stem from your elevator pitch; ideally something you can tick off during the interview to make sure you have covered the important stuff.</p><h3>Bread and butter topics</h3><p>Your \u201cbread and butter\u201d topics are the things you love talking about. You are more charismatic and engaging when talking about them, so it makes sense to steer the conversation towards them (as long as they don\u2019t detract from your core message)</p><p>Make a list of some bread and butter topics before the interview. You don\u2019t have to talk about all of them, but it can help to have them on hand.</p><p>As an example, here are my bread and butter topics right now:</p><ul><li>The ethics of having kids</li><li>Should EA orgs be active on social media?</li><li>The pain of teaching in English schools</li><li>Places to roller skate in London</li><li>Nuclear off-ramp strategies</li></ul><p>As you can see, they vary from \u201cserious\u201d to \u201ccasual\u201d. Depending on the subject of my podcast appearance, some would be too off-topic to include.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Last-minute speech coaching</h3><p>You probably don\u2019t have much time to improve your public speaking, so I will focus on low-effort, high-reward strategies.</p><p>The biggest podcast speaking pitfalls are:</p><ul><li>Saying \u201cum\u201d all the time</li><li>Using 100 words when only 20 are needed (also known as \u201cwaffling\u201d)</li><li>Talking too fast or mumbling (although there are podcast professionals, like Robert Wiblin, who have made fast-talking a virtue)</li></ul><p>Here are my strategies, starting with the lowest-effort:</p><p><strong>Practice alone.&nbsp;</strong>In front of the mirror, in the shower, it doesn\u2019t matter. Practising aloud will help you visualise being in the interview.</p><p><strong>Record yourself</strong>. Count how many times you say \u201cum\u201d. If it\u2019s more than one per minute, record again and repeat. The best way to tell if you\u2019re going too slow or too fast is to\u2026</p><p><strong>Get some feedback.&nbsp;</strong>Practise answering podcast questions with a friend, or record a response and send it to them. Be specific about what you would like feedback on: speaking speed? Saying \u201cum\u201d? Waffling? And try to have fun: a side-benefit is shaking the nerves away!</p><p>If you\u2019re feeling insecure, remember that speaking skills aren\u2019t everything. Podcaster Lex Fridman has been criticised for his pondering, monotone delivery, yet as someone recently said to me, \u201chis depth of character shines through\u201d. Fridman&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/lexfridman\"><u>has over 300 million views on Youtube</u></a>.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Audio Setup</h3><p>There are some quick, free things you can do to ensure decent audio quality. Here I will assume that you are conducting the interview remotely and that you don\u2019t have access to specialised recording equipment.</p><p><strong>Find the best place to record</strong> in your home/office. Your main enemies are&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Background noise</li><li>Echo</li><li>Poor internet connection</li></ul><p>You can test background noise and echo by recording short samples in different areas and listening back to them (the best acoustics in my house are in the walk-in wardrobe: the racks of clothes act as perfect insulation). If video is being recorded, you\u2019ll want good lighting on your face and an appropriate background.</p><p><strong>Record backup audio.</strong> If the primary recording is through your computer (on Zoom, for example), record a separate audio file on your phone. This way, if poor internet connection affects your end of the audio, your local phone recording can be used to replace it in the editing stage. If the host also records locally, both recordings can be combined later to create a higher-quality audio experience.</p><p><strong>Remember that editing is a thing.</strong> If you get interrupted mid-interview by sirens in the street or your housemate bursting in, don\u2019t worry! When the disturbance is over, just redo whatever you were saying. It takes seconds to correct in the editing stage.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>How your preparation might look</h1><p>Suppose you only have an hour to prepare. Then you\u2019ll want to prioritise the most effective strategies. Ideally this hour won\u2019t be&nbsp;<i>just before the interview</i>: it really helps to have time for ideas to settle in your mind.&nbsp;</p><p>Here\u2019s how your hour might look:</p><ol><li>Email the host with some clarifying questions&nbsp;<i>[10 mins]</i></li><li>Bullet-point your core message and 3-4 ideas that link to it&nbsp;<i>[10 mins]</i></li><li>Bullet-point 5 bread and butter topics that you might use&nbsp;<i>[5 mins]</i></li><li>Scout a good recording location, check you have a voice recording app on you phone&nbsp;<i>[15 mins]</i></li><li>Practise your opening response in the shower&nbsp;<i>[10 mins]</i></li><li>Write some post-it notes with top tips and place them in your eyeline for the interview&nbsp;<i>[10 mins]</i></li></ol><h1>A request for feedback</h1><p>All feedback is welcome. I would particularly like <i>links to episodes which exemplify some of the things mentioned above.</i></p><h1>An offer of help</h1><p>If you want some assistance in preparing for an upcoming appearance, I may be able to help.

It may be a bit more speculative than some people are comfortable with, and isn't a fully fleshed out philosophical argument. But, if you take the reality of consciousness experience seriously, I think these conclusions are unavoidable. Most ideas here are heavily inspired by work from </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/algekalipso\"><i>@algekalipso</i></a><i> and </i><a href=\"https://qri.org\"><i>QRI</i></a><i>.&nbsp;</i></p><hr><p>No conscious being can deny that suffering is real.</p><p>If somebody claims otherwise, I\u2019ll bet they\u2019re confusing it with pain. It\u2019s true that pain usually leads to suffering, but it\u2019s always possible to drug or meditate it away. This is because pain is just an intense feeling, while suffering is something else, a kind of <a href=\"https://opentheory.net/2021/07/a-primer-on-the-symmetry-theory-of-valence/\">discordance in consciousness</a>. Consider emotional suffering, for example. A bad breakup or a loved one\u2019s death doesn\u2019t cause any physical pain, but it does cause suffering. It\u2019s a real and unfortunate part of the universe, something that is undeniably bad.</p><p>The flip side of this though is that joy, happiness and love are real as well. They aren\u2019t just a byproduct of physical pleasure or the evolutionary drive to reproduce, but things that really exist as part of reality. If anything is good, it\u2019s these conscious experiences.</p><p>If we accept the reality of experience, it\u2019s hard to deny that the universe has value built in. The good <i>must</i> derive from reducing suffering and promoting bliss, every coherent conception of it must ultimately point to this fact. In other words, if we buy the self-evident fact that conscious valence is real, we get an <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is%E2%80%93ought_problem\">ought from an is</a>.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>An ethical theory of everything</h3><p>Given this strong argument for moral realism, I find it hard to imagine an ultimate ethical theory that isn\u2019t based on some form of utilitarianism. <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-deontological/\">Deontological</a> and <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-virtue/\">virtue</a> ethics may provide good tools for achieving good outcomes, but they don\u2019t get to the heart of the matter. Any coherent ethical theory must aim to attain a world-state with less suffering. This ultimately reduces to a form of utilitarianism that is based on measuring the quality of conscious experience, often referred to as <i>valence utilitarianism</i>.<a href=\"https://pursuingreality.substack.com/p/utilitarianism-is-the-only-option#footnote-1\"><sup>1</sup></a></p><p>Of course, things are more complicated than just this. It\u2019s possible to be in both positive and negative valence states at the same time, or have to choose from many different types of positive experiences. Can we say that peace is always better than joy? Or that physical pain is worse than emotional pain? Deciding exactly how to formulate utilitarianism may get a bit tricky (as expertly explored by Andr\u00e9s G\u00f3mez Emilsson <a href=\"https://qualiacomputing.com/2022/09/22/just-look-at-the-thing-how-the-science-of-consciousness-informs-ethics/\">on his blog</a>) but that doesn\u2019t mean that there isn\u2019t a <a href=\"https://www.samharris.org/books/the-moral-landscape\">general direction along which we can move</a> towards a better world. Creating more moments of joy or peace and fewer moments of suffering is always the right way to go.</p><p>In some cases, though, the details really do matter. As it is normally formalised, utilitarianism runs into a series of <a href=\"https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/why-i-am-not-an-effective-altruist\">repugnant conclusions</a>. But, if you look at them closely from the point of view of valence utilitarianism, some of them start to dissolve.</p><p>For example, take the the <a href=\"http://degreesofclarity.com/writing/utilitarianism/\"><i>rogue surgeon </i></a>thought experiment. If you only care about maximising the number of living people, it could make sense for surgeons to go around kidnapping healthy people and butchering them for their organs, which can then be transplanted into terminal patients, ultimately saving more people than are killed. However, this doesn\u2019t take into account all the collateral effects caused by the fear and insecurity that this kind of practice would unleash on the general population, not to mention the violent deaths of the victims. If we are trying to maximise positive conscious valence, we need to take into account the fact that feeling secure has a very meaningful effect on the experience of our lives. The terror unleashed wouldn\u2019t balance out the gains, so this scenario wouldn\u2019t make sense under valence utilitarianism. Any modification to the thought experiment to get around these problems would require a fantastical level of secrecy, which wouldn\u2019t play out in reality.</p><p>There are many other ways people try to point out holes in utilitarianism, with thought experiments about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_machine\">experience machines</a> and fictitious <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_monster#cite_note-3\">utility monsters</a>. But if you look at the details of a real world scenario from the perspective of valence utilitarianism, they can usually be <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/sharon-hewitt-rawlette-hedonistic-utilitarianism/\">explained away</a>.<a href=\"https://pursuingreality.substack.com/p/utilitarianism-is-the-only-option#footnote-2\"><sup>2</sup></a></p><h3>Dissolving the ultimate critique</h3><p>However, we are still left with the original <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/repugnant-conclusion/\">repugnant conclusion,</a> introduced by Derek Parfit. It states that with a na\u00efve formulation of utilitarianism, you can always conceive of a world filled with many lives barely worth living that has higher utility than another world filled with a modest number of extremely happy people. This seems like an unacceptable possibility. We would all rather be one of the few in the world of extreme bliss than one of the just-surviving masses.</p><p>This problem can be dissolved by valence utilitarianism as well, but you have to be willing to accept two truths about the way the universe is configured. Firstly, that the degree of enjoyment or suffering one can experience is likely logarithmic \u2014 the best (or worse) experience is many thousands of times better (or worse) than a mildly pleasant (or unpleasant) experience. Something that has been <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gtGe8WkeFvqucYLAF/logarithmic-scales-of-pleasure-and-pain-rating-ranking-and\">argued for convincingly</a> by the <a href=\"https://qri.org/\">Qualia Research Institute</a>.</p><p>The other, likely more controversial, truth is that <a href=\"https://manuherran.com/empty-open-and-closed-individualism/\"><i>closed individualism</i></a> \u2014 the common-sense belief that we are all metaphysically separate observers \u2014 is <a href=\"https://qualiacomputing.com/2020/06/06/mini-series-on-open-individualism/\">almost certainly false</a>. Believing that we have real separate and essential selves is a <a href=\"https://www.quora.com/What-does-David-Pearce-think-of-closed-empty-and-open-individualism\">useful evolutionary tool</a>, but doesn\u2019t really stand up to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-brain\">scientific</a> scrutiny or sustained <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatt%C4%81\">introspection</a>. This leaves us with <i>open individualism</i>, the belief that we are all one consciousness, or <i>empty individualism</i>, in which we are just a single moment of experience. Neither of the latter beliefs reify the existence of an individual self, and allow us to sum across the experiences of many different conscious beings, regardless of who they belong to.</p><p>Then, given logarithmic scales of valence and open or empty individualism, it\u2019s always going to be easier to achieve a high utility world-state with a few beings enjoying spectacular experiences, rather than filling the universe with miserable people. This is especially true when you play out a realistic scenario, and take the resources available into account.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Repugnancy signals an error in reasoning</h3><p>I actually think that the reason we find Parfit\u2019s repugnant conclusion so problematic is that our intuitions already get the above argument. We intuitively know that the best day of our lives was exponentially better than an average drizzly November afternoon. We also take for granted that the suffering of any being is equally bad, it doesn\u2019t matter who. It\u2019s just that we\u2019re not used to thinking in logarithmic scales or outside of closed individualism. So, when we start trying to carry out rough utility calculations, we don\u2019t take these points into account.</p><p>In fact, it seems like all repugnant conclusions point to a problem with a particular formulation of utilitarianism applied to an unrealistic scenario, not utilitarianism itself. From the standpoint of valence utilitarianism, if a solution brings us to a feeling of repugnancy, it itself is inducing a negative conscious experience. Given that the people living in an imagined world-state are probably still going to have fairly similar sensibilities to us, if that world state is unappealing to us, it would be unappealing to them. We can therefore never end up in a repugnant conclusion if we apply valence utilitarianism correctly.</p><p>Now, I realise it is always possible to push back against this with specialist <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_monster\">thought experiments</a>. But, applying it in realistic scenarios actually has pretty reasonable outcomes. This is helped by the fact that the human nervous system is set up in a way that actually keeps us in quite a narrow range of conscious valence. This is especially true for people free from the struggle to survive, with <a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1011492107\">enough resources to keep them comfortable</a>. We may be able to enjoy a few peak experiences in our life, but even the richest people in the world are firmly stuck in the human condition most of the time.</p><p>The practical application of utilitarianism in the real world is therefore probably best achieved with a sustainable and careful application of humanist values. Slowly increasing the number of people living meaningful and secure lives. For this purpose, I don\u2019t disagree with many of the criticisms of misconceived versions of utilitarianism that don\u2019t pay enough attention to conscious experience. In most cases, the application of deontological and virtue ethics can work well.</p><p>The other reason we have to be cautious when following valence utilitarianism is that there\u2019s no way to measure conscious experience. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTXduvkpS8Q\">You know it when you have it, but that\u2019s it</a>. We should therefore be incredibly careful when designing a future utopia, given that we have no idea the suffering we could <a href=\"https://superbowl.substack.com/p/a-different-kind-of-ai-risk-artificial\">unwittingly inflict</a>. These kind of considerations will likely come to a head as <a href=\"https://pursuingreality.substack.com/p/finally-getting-the-depth-of-the\">AI gets more powerful</a>. Not really ever being sure if they are actually conscious should give us pause <a href=\"https://t.co/lvQ4i7nPqN\">before we aim for a future dominated by AGIs</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Consciousness must come first</h3><p>So, even though utilitarianism is probably true, we have to be very thoughtful about how we formulate and apply it. If we are too ideological and insensitive, we will end up in repugnancy. But, if we are willing to take the reality of our conscious experience seriously, there should be a way to make it work. After all, it is the <a href=\"https://pursuingreality.substack.com/p/the-ways-of-knowing\">only thing we are sure of</a> and the only thing that could possibly bring value. Many of the bad outcomes of history came from forgetting of this fact and <a href=\"https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/karens-and-the-nature-of-evil\">forcefully applying artificial and inhuman values</a>.</p><p>These considerations are now more important than ever. As it\u2019s looking like the future is going to <a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/most-important-century/\">get quite crazy quite quickly</a>, our moral intuitions will likely start breaking down. We therefore need a concrete ethical framework to know how should we respond to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transhuman\">transhuman</a> technologies, or the possibility of producing artificial consciousnesses. It is therefore now incredibly important to get a strong <a href=\"https://qualiacomputing.com/2022/06/19/digital-computers-will-remain-unconscious-until-they-recruit-physical-fields-for-holistic-computing-using-well-defined-topological-boundaries/?utm_source=pocket_mylist\">understanding of the real nature of consciousness</a>. But, we also need a clear way of thinking about value. Valence utilitarianism is the only system that stands up to this task. If we don\u2019t want to lose ourselves in the coming future, we have to always bear one thing in mind \u2014consciousness comes first.</p><hr><p><i>For further reading or listening:</i></p><ul><li><i>Andr\u00e9s G\u00f3mez Emilsson\u2019s writing on </i><a href=\"http://qualiacomputing.com/\"><i>Qualia Computing</i></a><i>, especially </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bvtAXefTDQgHxc9BR/just-look-at-the-thing-how-the-science-of-consciousness\"><i>this</i></a><i>, </i><a href=\"https://qualiacomputing.com/2018/10/10/thoughts-on-the-is-ought-problem-from-a-qualia-realist-point-of-view/?utm_source=pocket_saves\"><i>this</i></a><i> and </i><a href=\"https://qualiacomputing.com/2022/06/19/digital-computers-will-remain-unconscious-until-they-recruit-physical-fields-for-holistic-computing-using-well-defined-topological-boundaries/?utm_source=pocket_mylist\"><i>this</i></a></li><li><i>The above ideas are put much more thoroughly by Sharon Hewitt Rawlette, both on the </i><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/wakingcosmos/consciousness-and-moral-realism-sharon-rawlette-waking-cosmos\"><i>Waking Cosmos</i></a><i> and </i><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/sharon-hewitt-rawlette-hedonistic-utilitarianism/\"><i>80000 hours</i></a><i> podcasts, and most completely in her </i><a href=\"https://sharonrawlette.com/books-2/the-feeling-of-value/?utm_source=pocket_mylist%2F\"><i>book</i></a></li><li><i>I was in part responding to </i><a href=\"https://open.substack.com/users/9379583-erik-hoel?utm_source=mentions\"><i>Erik Hoel</i></a><i>'s thought provoking </i><a href=\"https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/we-owe-the-future-but-why\"><i>criticisms</i></a><i> of </i><a href=\"https://erikhoel.substack.com/p/why-i-am-not-an-effective-altruist\"><i>Effective</i></a><a href=\"https://www.econtalk.org/erik-hoel-on-effective-altruism-utilitarianism-and-the-repugnant-conclusion/\"><i>Altruism</i></a><i> in </i><a href=\"https://erikhoel.substack.com/?utm_source=mentions\"><i>The Intrinsic Perspective</i></a></li><li><i>Sam Harris makes similar arguments in </i><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Moral_Landscape\"><i>The Moral Landscape</i></a></li><li><i>For thoughts on the potential for artificial suffering </i><a href=\"https://superbowl.substack.com/p/a-different-kind-of-ai-risk-artificial\"><i>this piece</i></a><i> over at </i><a href=\"https://superbowl.substack.com/?utm_source=mentions\"><i>Superb Owl</i></a><i>is interesting</i></li></ul>", "user": {"username": "aelwood"}}, {"_id": "Jiy3dNLvg7vvsvCHs", "title": "Is the US government insolvent?", "postedAt": "2022-12-01T13:58:20.596Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Disclaimer: I am not a trained economist.

In this short post, I aim to demonstrate that with inflation at decade highs and interest rates at 15-20 year highs, we may have already entered a debt spiral.&nbsp;</p><p>The US government currently has $31.3 trillion of debt. The interest expense <i><strong>alone</strong> </i>on the debt is $482 billion per year (average 1.5% interest rates). As the debt is repriced at current interest rates (currently ~4%, but let's take an average of 3%), the interest expense would increase by $500 billion per year to $1 Trillion per year. Additionally, the cost of living adjustments (COLA) to social security etc, combined with decreased tax receipts due to the recession, the annual deficit would organically increase at an unsustainable rate. This suggests the US government is already in a debt spiral, and the only way they can afford to finance the debt is to print money and essentially inflate the debt away.&nbsp;</p><p>It seems important for EAs to learn more about this not just to protect themselves against an inflationary decade (although we are currently in a short-term deflationary part of the cycle), but also so that we can consider the second-order consequences to this problem.</p><h2>The US budget at a glance</h2><p>In this section, I will show that when you take the tax revenue (the majority of the revenue to the government) and subtract it by JUST the mandatory and fixed items of spending alone, the US already lack the ability to cover their interest expenses. Lets start by taking a look at the <a href=\"https://www.usdebtclock.org/\">The US debt clock</a> so we can have an overview of the problem:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669903101/mirroredImages/Jiy3dNLvg7vvsvCHs/movlvsta1fkt6zhvizov.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/7a3a2389163c714e932e7c5b3e595a375857525486a60cf7.png/w_290 290w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/7a3a2389163c714e932e7c5b3e595a375857525486a60cf7.png/w_580 580w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/7a3a2389163c714e932e7c5b3e595a375857525486a60cf7.png/w_870 870w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/7a3a2389163c714e932e7c5b3e595a375857525486a60cf7.png/w_1160 1160w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/7a3a2389163c714e932e7c5b3e595a375857525486a60cf7.png/w_1450 1450w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/7a3a2389163c714e932e7c5b3e595a375857525486a60cf7.png/w_1740 1740w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/7a3a2389163c714e932e7c5b3e595a375857525486a60cf7.png/w_2030 2030w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/7a3a2389163c714e932e7c5b3e595a375857525486a60cf7.png/w_2320 2320w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/7a3a2389163c714e932e7c5b3e595a375857525486a60cf7.png/w_2610 2610w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/7a3a2389163c714e932e7c5b3e595a375857525486a60cf7.png/w_2850 2850w\"><figcaption>Screenshot of usdebtclock.org website as of 20th of Nov 2022</figcaption></figure><p>Pretty staggering.</p><p>The US gov tax revenue is $4.9T. According to <a href=\"https://www.cbo.gov/publication/58147\">the CBO (Congressional Budget Office)</a>, Mandatory spending will cost $3.7 trillion dollars in 2022. This includes all entitlements and expenditures that are signed into legislation and are considered absolute obligations, such as social security and medicare. Then we add in the estimated $800B of defense spending (which is contractual), and we get a total of $4.5T.</p><p><i>$4.9T revenue - $3.7T entitlements - $800B defense = $400B leftover for interest expense.</i></p><p>The problem is interest expense itself is currently costing $482 Billion dollars. So we have at least <strong>$82 Billion</strong> in deficit, which means we have to borrow even more money to pay back the extra interest expense that we can't pay back. Note that this doesn't even take into account some of the other discretionary spending as well as unfunded liabilities.</p><p>As James Lavish (ex-hedgefund manager who writes <a href=\"https://jameslavish.substack.com/\">The Informationist</a> newsletter) puts it:</p><blockquote><p>Think of it like this: You run up the balance on a credit card. The monthly payments are more than you have after paying for <i>mandatory</i> things like mortgage, car loans, and food. So, you take out another credit card to pay for some of these things. But your credit score is worse and the interest rate on this new card is higher. So, now the monthly payments are even higher. And you have borrowed more. To make those payments, you have to open another credit card\u2026and so on\u2026<i>you are trapped</i>.</p><p>It\u2019s no different for a country perpetually operating in a deficit.</p><p><i>more debt \u2192 higher interest rates \u2192 higher deficits \u2192 more debt</i></p><p>As it worsens, investors lose confidence in the country and demand higher rates for the country\u2019s bonds, only worsening the situation.</p></blockquote><p>This is also known as the dreaded debt spiral:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669903101/mirroredImages/Jiy3dNLvg7vvsvCHs/xuolhhqnu8ks3oegk3ck.jpg\"><figcaption><a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/08/14/business/markets-debt-spiral.html\"><u>Graphic by Guilbert Gates for The New York Times</u></a></figcaption></figure><h2>But interest rates have gone up a lot...</h2><p>As you may be aware, the federal reserve has been hiking interest rates at a historically fast pace in order to dampen demand and drive down inflation.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669903101/mirroredImages/Jiy3dNLvg7vvsvCHs/qnxxvzxnoz7vmdrs1a4t.png\" alt=\"Image\"><figcaption>Interest rates for US government bonds since COVID. Colors represent different maturities.</figcaption></figure><p>As the government debt reaches maturity, it needs to roll over and be repriced at current interest rates of 4% (but let's take an average of 3%) - think of this as your fixed-term interest rates on your mortgage running out so you need to renegotiate a new rate with the bank. If we reprice the current $31.3T of debt at 3% interest rates, the interest expense would increase by ~$500 billion per year to almost $1 Trillion per year - That will overtake military spending as the biggest single line item for spending.</p><h2>Cost of living adjustments (COLA)</h2><p>It gets worse (from a government debt perspective).</p><p>Because of the highest inflation in decades, there will be an upward cost of living adjustments made to spending from social security and other programs, and the CBO projects that this will be 6-9%.</p><h2>Impacts of the upcoming recession</h2><p>Although it hasn't been officially declared, by many indicators and measures, we will be, if not already, entering a recession. During a recession like in 2008 and 2020, government tax revenues tend to fall by 8-10% compared to previous years because of lower capital gains and corporate tax (less earnings); and at the same time, entitlement spending also increases because of the eventual higher unemployment.</p><p>Even excluding these additional factors, assuming steady GDP growth and no recessions, you get this ugly chart from the CBO modeled using lower interest rates from earlier this year:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669903101/mirroredImages/Jiy3dNLvg7vvsvCHs/z6pjtdd4cvbrg2kw0hxu.png\" alt=\"CBO Deficit Projection\"><figcaption>The projected deficit and total debt as a % of GDP.

As <a href=\"https://www.lynalden.com/fiscal-and-monetary-policy/\">Lyn Alden</a> (macro investor) points out from a <a href=\"https://seekingalpha.com/article/4359674-hirschmann-capital-1h-2020-letter\">letter by Hirschmann Capital</a>:</p><blockquote><p>They found that over the past two centuries, 51 out of 52 countries that reached sovereign debt levels of 130% of GDP ended up \u201cdefaulting\u201d, either through devaluation, inflation, restructuring, or outright nominal default, within a pretty wide spread of 0-15 years or so after that point.</p></blockquote><p>Because the US central bank has the ability to create new dollars out of thin air, the US government will almost never hard default on the debt (less certain). In the future, I will write another post about how I expect the US government will pay back this debt, but the short answer here is: The only choice is to let inflation run hot, higher than the stated 2% target, in the hopes to raise GDP and <i>monetize</i> the debt. In other words, use cheaper dollars to pay off old debts. Still only a short-term solution, though, as investors will eventually demand higher Treasury rates in order to be compensated for being paid back in cheaper dollars. It is likely that the federal reserve will have to do some form of quantitative easing again to keep interest rates low.

Therefore it appears reasonable to assume that the strength of this effect is not larger than that of the effect on insects. Moreover, including other wild animals would tend to further decrease the cost-effectiveness, \u201csuffering plausibly dominates happiness in nature\u201d based on <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://longtermrisk.org/files/the-importance-of-wild-animal-suffering.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1668277020380790&amp;usg=AOvVaw3HUG3ocaLKJxZTGQ3bJcaL\"><u>Tomasik 2015</u></a>.</p><h3>Civilisational resilience</h3><p>Wood can be useful as a source of energy for civilisational recovery after a severe <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/global-catastrophic-risk&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1668277020381643&amp;usg=AOvVaw2VU7iPeGtxUcIwDPXZH8ou\"><u>global catastrophe</u></a>&nbsp;(for example, involving the death of 99.9 % of the global population).

Strategically creating woodland in certain places could be positive, but the location of these is unclear. Consequently, the strength of this effect is arguably not larger than that of the heat mortality benefits by more that one order of magnitude.</p><h3>Tree planting workers</h3><p>An upper bound for the benefits to the tree planting workers could be estimated by assuming that all the costs represent cash benefits to tree planting workers with an annual income of 236 \u00a3<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsj2o378m3yd\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsj2o378m3yd\">[42]</a></sup></span>. For \u201cERPM\u201d projects, the mean cost is 1.69 k\u00a3/ha, which means the cash benefits to tree planting workers are limited to 7.14 (= 1.69 k / 236) doublings&nbsp;of consumption per hectare. Based on the equivalence between 2 doublings of consumption and 1 QALY <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/technical-updates-to-our-global-health-and-wellbeing-cause-prioritization-framework/&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1668277020383399&amp;usg=AOvVaw30uOs15Ehr4MqDMSRzNgTf\"><u>considered by Open Philanthropy</u></a>, and the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vT55dzzN72TGXHfWzufGazL_udRSbVObrWfEs9dga_ojr2ARjSNXKTaBzPlPM7T7X-PvwUKx5Yh-7Lm/pub#h.6kjmztj09tmu\"><u>utility of saving a life</u></a>&nbsp;of 51 QALY/life, the maximum benefits amount to 0.07 life/ha (= 7.14 / 2 / 51). The order of magnitude of this is similar to that of the heat mortality benefits.</p><h3>Non-modelled cooling</h3><p>The effect on the adjusted net removal of CO2e emissions caused by tree planting changing surface temperatures and fluxes of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://legacy.climate.ncsu.edu/edu/Heat%23:~:text%3DSensible%2520heat%2520is%2520the%2520energy,heat%2520(by%2520direct%2520conduction).&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1668277020384465&amp;usg=AOvVaw0MMU5OFlNNQEO9kgOg9Gh3\"><u>latent and sensible heat</u></a>&nbsp;(see, and tab \u201cCloud forcing\u201d) was implicitly modelled as null.

WCC</h1><p>The WCC is a UK standard which provides reassurance about the carbon sequestration of tree planting projects. The procedure it follows to determine the net removal of CO2e emissions is described in section 3 of <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.woodlandcarboncode.org.uk/images/PDFs/Woodland_Carbon_Code_V2.1_March_2021.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1668277020448133&amp;usg=AOvVaw3W6-hwaMihFoIq_yOdGa8Z\"><u>version 2.1 of the code</u></a>&nbsp;(the updated online version of the Standard &amp; Guidance is <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.woodlandcarboncode.org.uk/standard-and-guidance&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1668277020448381&amp;usg=AOvVaw3jOmMPEqHTBlNgHubdR_3y\"><u>here</u></a>). It is also briefly outlined in the following sections.</p><h2>Carbon baseline</h2><p>The WCC establishes a baseline for the carbon sequestration over time (counterfactual), against which the impact of the project can be measured. The baseline is based on the continuation of the land use prior to the forestation project. It includes four carbon pools:</p><ul><li>Tree biomass above and below ground biomass.</li><li>Litter and deadwood.</li><li>Non-tree biomass above and below ground biomass.</li><li>Soil.</li></ul><h2>Carbon leakage</h2><p>The WCC defines leakage as \u201cland use change/intensification outside the project boundary but within the UK\u201d. If it is proposed by the land manager, the project shall carry out an assessment to determine whether it will result in additional CO2e emissions. Otherwise, it is assumed to be null.</p><p>Underreporting of leakage would likely result in overestimating the net removal of emissions.</p><h2>Project carbon sequestration</h2><p>The net removal of emissions is calculated with the WCC Carbon Calculation Spreadsheet, whose version 2.4 is available <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.woodlandcarboncode.org.uk/images/PDFs/WCC_CarbonCalculation_Guidance_V2.4_March2021.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1668277020449897&amp;usg=AOvVaw28ACLSItoz66w793OonUJv\"><u>here</u></a>. The calculator includes the following:</p><ul><li>Emissions from establishment activities, ongoing management and clearfell.</li><li>Emissions from soil disturbance.</li><li>Sequestration in tree biomass, litter and deadwood (and in a limited number of scenarios, soil).</li></ul><h2>Net carbon sequestration</h2><p>The net removal of CO2e emissions (or \u201cnet carbon sequestration\u201d) accounts for the difference between the factual and counterfactual carbon sequestration, as well as leakage. At Year 5, the net removal of CO2e emissions is based on the projected carbon sequestration. From Year 15 onwards, it is based on field survey measurements.</p><h1>Appendix D. Effect of tree planting on the emergence of pandemics</h1><p>According to &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://ipbes.net/sites/default/files/2020-12/IPBES%2520Workshop%2520on%2520Biodiversity%2520and%2520Pandemics%2520Report_0.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1668277020450872&amp;usg=AOvVaw0mv2coZeHnfZfyVlLd9O9r\"><u>IPBES 2020</u></a>, \u201cland-use change is a globally significant driver of pandemics and caused the emergence of more than 30% of new diseases reported since 1960\u201d. However, to the extent the driver for this is the contact between humans and farmed animals with wildlife, the case for deforestation causing pandemics seems stronger than the case for forestation preventing pandemics:</p><ul><li>Deforestation is often caused by urbanisation and expansion of animal farming. Consequently, preventing it tends to minimise contact with wildlife.</li><li>On the other hand, forestation would only prevent contact with wildlife if it prevented deforestation (driven by the expansion of animal farming and urbanisation). However, no evidence was found for this.</li><li>In addition, forestation could arguably contribute to causing pandemics, if the degree of contact with wildlife required to establish forests is not negligible.</li></ul><p>A quick google search seemingly supports this. \u201dDeforestation could cause pandemics. but that does necessarily imply that forestation prevents pandemics. I only found evidence supporting the former. In fact, forestation could increase the risk of pandemics, as it should require more contact with wildlife.</p><h1>Appendix E. Tree planting impact multipliers</h1><p>In order to establish a prior view, tree planting was assessed based on the impact multipliers mentioned in the most recent climate <a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://assets.ctfassets.net/x5sq5djrgbwu/7eEpX4UcKNEy6LUDhf2B05/735518c277987ad5ad91f096b1fdc2a7/A_guide_to_the_changing_landscape_of_high-impact_climate_philanthropy.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1668277020452444&amp;usg=AOvVaw2c78ASl43qjfWIx9-S_Rvq\"><u>report</u></a>&nbsp;published by FP. These are \u201creasons to expect that a given funding allocation will have an above-average impact\u201d, and do not replace the analysis of specific opportunities. \u201cRather, they serve as an orientation for where to search and as a prior of how surprised we should be to find high-impact opportunities in different parts of the climate funding space\u201d (see section \u201cImpact Multipliers\u201d of Founder Pledge\u2019s report for more details).</p><p>Tree planting is not expected to be effective based on FP\u2019s impact multipliers, which are described in the following sections.</p><h3>Neglectedness</h3><p>Tree planting is not neglected, and therefore it does not benefit from this impact multiplier.

As a result, it does not benefit from this impact multiplier.</p><h3>Advocacy</h3><p>\u201cWe think that funding organizations that are trying to influence how societal resources (incl. attention) are allocated provides a strong impact multiplier compared to funding more direct interventions\u201d.</p><p>Tree planting is an intervention with direct effects on global warming, and therefore it does not benefit from this impact multiplier.</p><h3>Trajectory changes</h3><p>\u201cWe think it is likely that engaging around trajectory changes -- in situations where decisions will have consequences for long time-spans due to self-reinforcing dynamics and/or stickiness provide another impact multiplier, although we think this requires pairing with assessments of neglectedness\u201d.</p><p>\u201cDynamics which have this trajectory-shaping character\u201d:</p><ol><li>\u201c<strong>Virtuous cycles around technological change</strong>: Cost reductions, increased demand, further cost reductions, as seen with solar, wind, electric cars, and batteries\u201d.</li><li>\u201c<strong>Vicious cycles around carbon lock-in</strong>: Infrastructure and regulatory choices that favour particular technologies, or capital-intensive investments with long lifetimes, etc.\u201d.</li><li>\u201c<strong>Virtuous cycles around social movements and shifting social norms</strong>: E.g. the emergence of a national-level climate movement, once that movement reaches national name recognition it can profit from lots of attention and funding\u201d.</li><li>\u201c<strong>Spreading of policy ideas</strong>: The adoption of policy ideas across the world based on one or a few leading examples, as observed with carbon taxes, emissions trading systems, binding climate laws, net-zero commitments etc\u201d.</li></ol><p>Tree planting does not seem to robustly benefit from any of these dynamics.</p><h3>Catalytic growth</h3><p>\u201cWe believe that \u201coverhead\u201d, unrestricted funding or funding directly targeted at improving the workings of an organization -- such as operations, fundraising, but also communications and strategy -- is often underprovided for small-to-medium-sized organizations\u201d.</p><p>The largest organisation analysed (income of 60 M\u00a3) will most likely not benefit from this impact multiplier, but the smallest ones (income lower than 1 M\u00a3) could.</p><h3>Global diffusion of technological change</h3><p>\u201cOutsized changes in the global energy system with emissions consequences far beyond can be induced\u201d via:</p><ol><li>\u201cResearch &amp; Development &amp; Demonstration (RD&amp;D), i.e. early-stage innovation support (\u201ctechnology push\u201d)\u201d.</li><li>\u201cDemand-policies for early deployment, such as deployment subsidies, public procurement, standards requiring new technologies (\u201cdemand-pull\u201d)\u201d.</li></ol><p>Tree planting is an intervention with direct effects on global warming, and therefore it does not benefit from this impact multiplier.</p><h3>Policy additionality</h3><p>\u201cBeing additional is not only about being additional to other funders but also about being additional to existing policy targets\u201d.</p><p>Tree planting in the UK, \u201cwhere there is a binding climate law\u201d, does not seem to benefit from this multiplier.

Behaviours are the observable actions that result from decisions, including:</p><ul><li>introducing a bill into parliament that prohibits companies in your country from selling AI hardware to entities in another country</li><li>applying to work at Anthropic, an AI safety company</li><li>documenting machine learning development processes in preparation for third party audits</li></ul><p>That means that good human decision-making and behaviours about how to develop and use AI can steer us towards a much better future - one characterised by vastly increased flourishing and well-being, and bad human decision-making and behaviours about how to develop and use AI can steer us towards a much worse future.&nbsp;</p><p>Work in longtermist AI governance (especially in policy and field-building;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ydpo7LcJWhrr2GJrx/the-longtermist-ai-governance-landscape-a-basic-overview\"><u>Clarke, 2022</u></a>) tries to create some valued outcome (e.g., improving US emerging technology policy) by designing or implementing some intervention (e.g., Open Philanthropy Technology Policy Fellowship). The way that these interventions would create the valued outcome is by changing behaviour (e.g., applying to fellowship; applying for a US policy role; persuading others to adopt a policy option that is more robust to advanced AI).</p><p>But how effective are these interventions in influencing the important behaviours that lead to these valued outcomes? In my experience working with government departments and large organisations on policy-relevant research and implementation, most groups that try to create some outcome like 'get people to comply with regulation X' just do what they usually do (e.g., try to educate, coerce, incentivise, punish) without investigating \u2018what works\u2019 to influence that specific behaviour in that specific audience and context. Sometimes this is due to a lack of understanding about what influences behaviour in other people (e.g., the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/typical-mind-fallacy\"><u>typical mind fallacy</u></a>), and sometimes it\u2019s because the interventions they have the power to design and implement don\u2019t address the behavioural influences.&nbsp;</p><p>Lots of organisations I've worked with say that in hindsight, \"it's obvious\" why their intervention didn't work... but if they knew that then they should have chosen a different intervention! Other organisations are sure they know why people aren\u2019t enrolling in a program that would deliver valued outcomes, but when you investigate, the organisation\u2019s intuition is totally wrong.</p><p>Incorporating behaviour into theories of change and program logics for AI governance activities is useful because it can help make assumptions explicit about&nbsp;<i>how</i> and&nbsp;<i>why</i> an intervention (e.g., offering a paid fellowship in fundamentals of AI safety) is supposed to lead to valued outcomes (safer development and use of AI).

For example, AI safety researchers could be involved in identifying and prioritising behaviours. Regulators, policymakers, firms, and customers could be involved in exploring influences on behaviours, and can help to build momentum or appetite for change. Firms or policymakers could help validate assumptions about the feasibility of interventions during intervention design, lead a pilot trial, engage in impact measurement, and accelerate wider implementation of an effective intervention at scale.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1670029758/mirroredImages/LD6wKNdPbxfdgYnao/adqlrjpzofqyukpbctgr.png\" alt=\"Figure 3.

We can improve the linkage between interventions and valued outcomes by making explicit that interventions change behaviour via specific influences (eg awareness, motivation), and that this behaviour change is what leads to valued outcomes.</figcaption></figure><p>Although the example was not specifically focused on advanced AI, this process could be applied to many different audiences and behaviours, such as:</p><ul><li>What are the behavioural influences on AI development firm organisational leaders to advocate for a windfall clause?</li><li>Are AI safety courses focused on training and education addressing the behavioural drivers for career change in young talented professionals?</li></ul><p>In the final section, I expand the perspective of behaviour science from this process focus to consider other ways that I think behaviour science can help advance AI governance goals.</p><h1><strong>Other ways behaviour science can help AI governance</strong></h1><p>There are at least four other ways I think applying behaviour science can help address challenges in AI governance.</p><p>First, behaviour science can help&nbsp;<strong>reduce complexity</strong>. The interdependence of technical and social changes in the development and use of advanced AI (<a href=\"https://matthijsmaas.com/publication/2021.-maas-phd-dissertation/\"><u>Maas, 2021</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/FaEBwhhe3otzYKGQt/p/bffA9WC9nEJhtagQi#Sociotechnical_Systems_View\"><u>Hendrycks, 2021</u></a>; for a broader view see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eist.2021.10.010\"><u>Kaufman, Saeri et al, 2021</u></a>) means that it's very difficult to figure out what the problem is, where to intervene in the system, or understand the counterfactual effects of an intervention. Behaviour science is intentionally reductionist it can reduce the dimensions of a problem by identifying &amp; extracting specific decisions or actions. Behaviour science methods also tend to be highly practical or pragmatic (e.g., behaviour identification and prioritisation), work well with methods for navigating complexity (e.g., systems or stakeholder mapping), and can leverage existing knowledge about that decision or action in other contexts (e.g., evidence and practice reviews).&nbsp;</p><p>Second, behaviour science can help to&nbsp;<strong>coordinate action among different system actors</strong>, all of whom have different perspectives on the problems and solutions in governance. These perspectives are often in tension, for example between narrow and transformative AI (<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1007/s00146-017-0734-3\"><u>Baum, 2017</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1038/s42256-018-0003-2\"><u>Cave, 2019</u></a>), or between the engineering and social science perspectives on feasible and effective strategies for safe AI (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BJtekdKrAufyKhBGw/ai-governance-needs-technical-work\"><u>Baker, 2022</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://distill.pub/2019/safety-needs-social-scientists/\"><u>Irving &amp; Askell, 2019</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.legalpriorities.org/research_agenda.pdf\"><u>Winter, 2019</u></a>). Questions such as \u201cwho needs to do what differently to achieve a valued outcome\u201d or \u201cwhat are people already doing, and why\u201d can align these perspectives around concrete problems or solutions<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefl2n2p75cuao\"><sup><a href=\"#fnl2n2p75cuao\">[7]</a></sup></span>. If agreement can be reached on which actors holds responsibility for change, or which actions need to increase / decrease, this can break through uncertainty / hesitancy biases, and improve collaborative capacity among system actors (e.g., each actor can then take or give responsibility for certain strategies to improve the situation). These questions are also readily answerable using behaviour science methods.</p><p>Third, behaviour science can help to&nbsp;<strong>measure progress towards or away from valued futures</strong>. Opaque or missing outcomes among people and organisations that advocate for better AI governance can make it hard to determine whether activity X or organisation Y is making progress, especially if they are pushing for policy or legislative changes (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XyEKTDtfMH4DukhaF/the-challenges-with-measuring-the-impact-of-lobbying\"><u>Animal Ask, 2022</u></a>). And even if policy is successfully changed, this does not by itself develop, deploy, or use safer AI systems. Instead, it\u2019s about human compliance with or adoption of the policy - both of which are observable actions (i.e., behaviours). The benefit of behavioural outcomes is that they can be counted / measured and this can be tracked over time. People and organisations can then see whether their activities are making progress towards or away from valued futures. This approach can be further enriched with adaptive policy-making (<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2012.12.006\"><u>Hasnoot et al, 2013</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/j.techfore.2016.01.012\"><u>Malekpour et al, 2016</u></a>) and other methods for planning under uncertainty (<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.3390/su5030955\"><u>Walker et al, 2013</u></a>)</p><p>Fourth, behaviour science (especially when framed as behavioural economics, behavioural public policy, or behavioural insights) is a&nbsp;<strong>credible and normal approach&nbsp;</strong>to shaping public and private policy design and implementation (<a href=\"https://documents.worldbank.org/en/publication/documents-reports/documentdetail/710771543609067500/behavioral-science-around-the-world-profiles-of-10-countries\"><u>Afif et al, 2019</u></a>). The framing of existential risk or unborn trillions as moral patients can be seen as \u2018weird\u2019 and way beyond the time or influence horizon that most people incorporate into their decision-making. Today, AI is usually seen through narrow lenses of equity, ethics, transparency in decision-making, and data security. Using behaviour science to identify, explain, or suggest behaviour changes aligned with better transitions to worlds with advanced AI is more likely to be accepted and acted upon because this approach is common in dealing with other social issues.</p><h1><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1><p>Human decision-making and concrete, observable actions about how to develop and use AI now will influence how successfully we navigate the transitions to a world with advanced AI systems. Through a worked example focusing on&nbsp;<i>documentation of development processes</i> among&nbsp;<i>mid-size AI firms ML development teams</i>, I described how behaviour science can help to identify and prioritise behaviours that are important for achieving valued outcomes; understand the influences on those behaviours; and design and test interventions that can change those behaviours. I also argued that applying behaviour science to challenges in AI governance can help cut through complexity, build shared understandings of problems and solutions, measure progress or change, and improve credibility to groups outside the core AI safety community.&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnqdvhf58a1l\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefqdvhf58a1l\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Behaviour science is an applied interdisciplinary approach that uses social science methods (especially psychology and economics) to try and understand, predict, and/or influence human behaviour. Theories or models of behaviour change often distinguish between several types of behavioural&nbsp;<i>influences&nbsp;</i>that make behaviour more or less likely. The suite of behaviour science methods can be applied to identify&nbsp;<i>who needs to do what differently</i> as a first step in designing interventions that target specific groups (the \u2018who\u2019) and attempt to change specific behaviours linked to valued outcomes (the \u2018what\u2019). They can also be applied to identify and understand drivers of behaviours, which can help to design interventions that address those drivers and are therefore more likely to work. Although behaviour science has been applied with success to making incremental improvements to relatively stable systems, I have also led and supported behaviour science research (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eist.2021.10.010\"><u>Kaufman, Saeri et al 2021</u></a> [<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/krmcv\"><u>open access</u></a>]) that has grappled with sustainability transitions, and other systems under change (for more on the relationship between AI development, AI governance and systems change, see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://matthijsmaas.com/publication/2021.-maas-phd-dissertation/\"><u>Maas, 2021</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/FaEBwhhe3otzYKGQt/p/bffA9WC9nEJhtagQi#Sociotechnical_Systems_View\"><u>Hendrycks, 2021</u></a>)</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fni07x391xo3p\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefi07x391xo3p\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>This paper, published in the journal&nbsp;<i>Science</i>, is a summary of a longer report from a wide range of people and organisations who work in AI (<a href=\"http://www.towardtrustworthyai.com/\"><i><u>Towards Trustworthy AI</u></i></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2004.07213\"><u>Brundage, Avin, Wang, Belfield et al, 2020</u></a>).</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fntaawqihlbma\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreftaawqihlbma\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>The topic of how or whether third party audits improve AI safety is discussed in more detail in the full&nbsp;<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2004.07213\"><i><u>Towards Trustworthy AI</u></i></a><i>&nbsp;</i>report (p. 11).&nbsp;</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn1dehu9ed7wl\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref1dehu9ed7wl\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;In this worked example, we focus on \u2018mid-size AI development firms\u2019 as a way of indirectly setting a lower bound on the number of actors, e.g., at least tens or hundreds of firms. Behaviour science works best at scale by identifying population-level (or segment-level) influences on behaviour and designing interventions that address these influences. While behaviour science is also often applied within / for a single organisation or a small number of actors, different methods to those discussed in this worked example can be a better fit (for an academic discussion of these different \u2018lenses\u2019 on behaviour, see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eist.2021.10.010\"><u>Kaufman, Saeri et al 2021</u></a> [<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/krmcv\"><u>open access</u></a>]).</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnays1hzmk1pg\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefays1hzmk1pg\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>We could identify audiences and behaviours through a combination of desktop research (e.g., evidence or literature review, which would have identified the Avin et al and Partnership on AI papers), and practitioner engagement (e.g., interviews or workshops with policymakers, ML development teams, AI safety researchers).

This means the interventions / levers available to us are different to those available to individuals or teams within an organisation, regulators, civil society, industry networks, or other actors in the AI development ecosystem. Interventions that rely on clear and persuasive communication, leveraging social relationships or reputation, or capacity-building (e.g., training or education) are likely to be more feasible for our organisation. In contrast, coercing firms through legislation, or punishing non-complying firms might be impossible for our organisation.&nbsp;</p><p>More on&nbsp;<i><strong>effectiveness</strong></i>: In this worked example, we might be highly trusted compared to other actors, which might increase our access to teams within firms or increase the prestigiousness of a non-cash prize we establish for audit trails. Conversely, we may lack content knowledge about what kinds of process documentation is in fact effective for reducing risk or improving safety, or we may lack capacity to deliver training and education. Ultimately, effectiveness also depends on the perceived acceptability or tolerance of an intervention by the audience (e.g., firms and teams).</p><p>More on&nbsp;<i><strong>adaptability&nbsp;</strong></i><strong>/&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>scalability</strong></i>: We may want other ecosystem actors to take responsibility for large scale implementation (e.g., have a regulator adapt a voluntary reporting scheme used by some firms into a mandatory reporting requirement required for all firms).
