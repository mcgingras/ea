It is still the case that most EAs believe that the variance in the importance of different people's experience is relatively small, that variance almost certainly does not align with historical conceptions of racism, and that there are at least some decent game-theoretic arguments to ignore a good chunk of this variance, but this does not mean that \"all people count equally\" is a \"core belief\" which should clearly only be reserved for an extremely small number of values and claims. It might be a good enough approximation in almost all practical situations, but it is really not a deep philosophical assumption of any of the things that I am working on, and I am confident that if I were to bring it up at an EA meetup, someone would quite convincingly argue against it.</p><p>This might seem like a technicality, but in this context the statement is specifically made to claim that EA has a deep philosophical commitment to valuing all people equally, independently of the details about how their mind works (either because of genetics, or development environment, or education). This reassurance does not work. I (and my guess is also almost all extrapolations of the EA philosophy) value people approximately equally in impact estimates because it looks like the relative moral patienthood of different people, and the basic cognitive makeup of people, does not seem to differ much between different populations, not because I have a foundational philosophical commitment to impartiality. If it was the case that different human populations did differ on the relevant dimensions a lot, this would spell a real moral dilemma for the EA community, with no deep philosophical commitments to guard us from coming to uncomfortable conclusions (luckily, as far as I can tell, in this case almost all analyses from an EA perspective lead to the conclusion that it's probably reasonable to weigh people equally in impact estimates, which doesn't conflict with society's taboos, so this is not de-facto a problem).</p><p>Moving on, I do not believe that this statement is speaking on behalf of the employees of CEA, many of which I am confident also feel quite badly represented by this statement, and is also not speaking on behalf of Effective Altruism. I don't know what process has produced it, but I don't think it is speaking for me or almost anyone else I know within the EA community. Organizations themselves don't have beliefs, and EA has generally successfully avoided descending into meaningless marketing and PR speech where organizations take positions despite nobody at those organizations actually believing those positions. If you want to make a statement on this matter, speak as an individual. Individuals can meaningfully have beliefs. Organizations pretending to have beliefs is usually primarily a tactic to avoid taking responsibility and creating a diffuse target.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, it is completely unclear from your statement whether you are referring to Bostrom's original email or whether you are referring to Bostrom's apology. I don't know why you are being ambiguous, but it seems quite plausible that you are doing so in order to not be able to be pinned on either repudiating the statements in Bostrom's apology, which seem quite reasonable to me and many other EAs (and would therefore attract ire from the community), or failing to repudiate those same statements which are attracting a lot of ire publicly due to not being explicitly anti-racist enough. If this is indeed what you are doing, then please stop. This ambiguity is toxic to clear communication. If this is not what you are doing, then please clarify, and also please get better at writing, it seems really extremely obvious that this was going to be a problem with this statement.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, you are also &nbsp;not linking to either Bostrom's original statement, or his apology. I don't know why. It would both clear up the ambiguity discussed above, and it would provide crucial context for anyone trying to understand what is going on, and who might have not seen Bostrom's apology. My guess is you are doing this with some other PR reason in mind. Maybe so that when people Google this topic later on this doesn't show up in search? Maybe so that the lack of context makes it less likely that other people outside of the community will understand what this statement is about? In any case, either please get better at communicating, or stop the weird PR games that you are seemingly trying to play here.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, despite this only being a single paragraph, I think there has been little produced by CEA that has made me feel as badly represented, and that has made me feel as alienated from the EA community as this statement.

But that's only half-right: if the research has all these limitations, it makes more sense to be uncertain about the causes.</p><p>When I closely followed the controversy around Sam Harris and his interview of Charles Murray and later the conflict and subsequent discussion between Sam Harris and Ezra Klein, I noticed that the side that was accusing Sam Harris of pandering to pseudoscience was lying about a bunch of easily-verifiable things. I'm not sure I would understand the science well enough to say that they're wrong about their scientific claims (and I didn't bother to read their work in detail), but I think it's good practice not to trust liars. (Ezra Klein was more of a weasel in that discussion than a liar \u2013 the people I think were lying were people whose hit piece against Harris and Murray Ezra Klein allowed to be published on Vox.)&nbsp;<br><br>Given the above, it seems possible to me that genetic influences also play a role. It seems plausible on priors (would be a coincidence if all groups are the same in all regards), we have some precedent for group differences (I think the research on Ashkenazi jews having higher average IQ is less controversial?), and it can't fill you with confidence in the other position when we can observe how some people are morally confused so they think the topic is so politically dangerous that they feel the need to lie about things (e.g., in the Sam Harris context, but also recent EA twitter threads I've seen go in that direction).</p><p>It seems clear that some group differences are environmental-only. However, note that, even if they weren't, it wouldn't have any political implications. The benefits of access to good things that underprivileged groups often have less of, like access to education, health care, infrastructure, both parents involved in upbringing (though of course many single parents do an excellent job raising their kids), etc., these benefits don't have much to do with IQ increases! Instead, access to these things is beneficial in all kinds of ways for anyone.

(Imagine how much of a convenient weapon you'd be handing over to racists if they can point out how the anti-racists are staking their claims on potentially flawed science and how they're punishing anyone who expresses uncertainty.) There's no reason to consider group averages morally relevant. It's a huge confusion to act as though there's a lot that morally depends on it.<br><br>I also downvoted sapphire's comments in some places (though not this thread) because they make it seem like there's some conspiracy in EA around this stuff and because I don't like their use of the term \"Scientific Racism.\" (I think the term is very appropriate for many scientists in the early 20th century or before, but very unfair to use towards people like Charles Murray or ones who say things like Bostrom said in his apology.) Regarding the alleged conspiracy, I had to look up what \"HBD\" exactly means. It might be true that some contrarian types are drawn to these topics in Bay area and via that spinoff from Slatestarcodex where people get kicks from discussing controversial topics. But that seems not particularly representative to me (and more rationalists than EAs)? In any case, I mostly talk to EAs in London and Oxford, where I've never seen anyone express any interest in these topics whatsoever, \"EA leadership\" least of all. I agree that the voting patterns maybe suggests something about EA being unusual, but to me that mostly implies stuff like \"EAs/rationalists are skeptical of making confident claims where the evidence is unlikely to support such claims.\"</p>", "parentCommentId": "Y9ZyL5FTzbpJv6Dqi", "user": {"username": "Lukas_Gloor"}}, {"_id": "vxBtpW58bjovDdjjj", "postedAt": "2023-01-13T13:55:59.211Z", "postId": "ALzE9JixLLEexTKSq", "htmlBody": "<p>IMO, I actually agree with the point that high decouplers and low decouplers can't live together very well.

This is likely not news to anyone reading this, so I apologize for wasting your time so far.\nI think your post adeptly highlights the reason for why EA as a movement will almost inevitably (IMO) collapse or split.\nI want to elaborate on the last point most of all. As an observer, I always thought that core point of EA was based in recognizing the fallibility of human emotion in guiding us about priorities, as strong emotional states can cloud our thinking (AFAIK this is not very controversial and is supported by research). This is why Paul Bloom's \"Against Empathy\" is referenced relatively frequently in the community, right? My not important personal opinion is that this is a partial picture, because emotion can also be used as a driver/inspiration to care about injustices. Of course the difficult question is whether you can get the best parts of emotion into the movement without getting the worst of emotion as well.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But there's something broader that concerns me, and I think spells trouble for the EA movement as a whole. I will start from a story that has to do with my FtM self. When I started hormonal therapy I noticed that some of my basic intuitions started changing, the feelings and views I wasn't even aware of existing. I kind of took them for granted, they were transparent to me. For example, before, I felt a lot of instinctive anger at injustice, and now I still feel it, but it's more detached and principled. \"Less emotional\" doesn't quite describe it, it's something about the anger becoming more calculating. Like I can be a bit more removed and hypothetical about different problems; I could turn off my empathy a bit (which actually felt scary!) to be more analytical. And to repeat, I assumed my previous emotional responses to be same as everyone's, it didn't even occur to me things could be any other way (I'm sorry if this all sounds like pseudoscience).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Now a lot changed in me that could have resulted in the above, and even though other T people I know have on average followed a similar switch (depending on the direction), I didn't think much of it. So it could be totally useless anecdotally, but it did get me reading on the \"gender divide\" in Western politics. And to simplify it greatly, it seems like there's pretty convincing argument that the gradual \"feminization\" of Western cultures in the last several decades drives a lot of the conflict in politics and across institutions, being in a tension with the typical \"masculine\" culture. And this is rooted partly in that women and men, on average, have different views on things like speech/harm tradeoff: women tend to prefer to limit speech to minimize harm, whereas men lean in the other direction.

And the \"Effective Altruism\" movement has historically been (to my understanding) a movement that prioritizes asking difficult (even if very offensive) questions and analyzing costs/benefits in a way that increases accuracy (in part, by trying to be less emotional/swayed about the topic of the analysis).

The reviewed book performed a study on twins and noticed there isn\u2019t much of a difference between the correlation of the similarity of many personality traits with whether people are identical twins, and concluded that, since you\u2019d expect to see a difference if the traits have different degree of heritability, many personality traits are results of the environment.</p>\n<p>How is this an evidence that twin studies are flawed and shouldn\u2019t be used? If that\u2019s a correct study, it\u2019s just evidence that personality traits are mostly formed by environment (which is something I already believe and have believed for the most of my life), but, e.g., why would this be relevant for a discussion of whether or not some disease has a genetic component to it, when a twin study shows that there is?</p>\n<p>It\u2019s important to carefully compare the numbers; but obviously there are things that identical twins have in common more often then non-identical twins, because these things are heritable at to larger or lesser degree; like hair color or height.</p>\n<p>Of course, any study makes some underrepresentation of humanity. But if your study is about the degree of heredity of something and not about twins, why would this matter? If there\u2019s a difference between adopted identical and non-identical twins that\u2019s better explained by genetics (e.g., non-identical twins would have a different height more often), why does it matter how well they represent twins in general? Unless you\u2019re studying how likely people are to be adopted, I don\u2019t understand the claim.</p>\n<p>The last link is paywalled, but again, why would this affect the difference between identical twins and non-identical twins? Until a year ago, I kept secret that I\u2019m bi and would\u2019ve kept it secret from scientists;  but I don\u2019t think this kind of thing affects conclusions you\u2019d make if identical twins answered identically to some question more often than non-identical twins (e.g., imagine a society where people with green eyes are persecuted and a lot of them use contact lenses. Some would still say the truth, in confidence, to scientists; and the number of identical twins telling the same answer would be greater than the amount of non-identical twins telling the same answer, and the scientists will correctly infer this to be evidence for the heritability of eye color, even though a lot of twins would lie about their eye color).</p>\n<p>So while it\u2019s possible to just compare full DNAs and account for lots of different factors (all sorts of various environmental conditions that might be different between the subjects of the study) to find out whether DNA correlates with eye color, it\u2019s much easier to do a twin study, and a strong correlation there will be a strong evidence</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "qs5XANPCnTkogroij", "user": {"username": "Samin"}}, {"_id": "F24ueBhj3nhBwiTxC", "postedAt": "2023-01-14T10:19:54.637Z", "postId": "ALzE9JixLLEexTKSq", "htmlBody": "<p>So I get this mail is bad PR, but people seem to object to it beyond that and it isn't clear to me why.

(E.g., some of the points he makes would also speak against studying whether mammals are smarter than fish given that fish have more genetic diversity than all mammals together and are a bit of an \"unnaturally drawn group in biology\".)

Average national IQ is also fairly strongly correlated with <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2862754\">measures of national welfare such as per Capita GDP</a>.</p>\n<p>To be clear, I'm not saying studying this question is more important than anything else, just that research on it should not be suppressed, whatever the truth may be. This point was perhaps best put in the conclusion of <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09515089.2019.1697803\">this great paper</a> on the topic:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The strategy \u2013 advocated by some influential scholars \u2013 of stigmatizing, suppressing, or downplaying evidence in favor of hereditarianism about group differences has been tried and has not worked. Research on this topic has been done and the results are widely available. Major psychology journals continue to publish work that deals openly with group differences (though researchers still debate about the relative contribution of genes and environment, and the question has not been settled definitively). Any measures that would be effective in preventing further work, such as those advocated by Kourany (2016), would have to be so severe that they would only attract even more attention to the findings they aimed to suppress. Science will carry on, and these questions will be answered. We should prepare in advance for the possibility that the genes underlying intelligence differences will not be distributed identically among ethnic groups. Failure to do this will only create a vacuum for \u201ccranks rather than scientists\u201d to opine on the nature and consequences of group differences (Anomaly, 2017, p. 293). Reich (2018) warns that if scientists \u201cwillfully abstain from laying out a rational framework for discussing human differences, [they] will leave a vacuum that will be filled by pseudoscience\u201d (p. 258).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This paper has argued that the usual utilitarian reasons given for restricting intelligence research are not convincing and, in fact, there are strong reasons, both utilitarian and non-utilitarian, to favor free inquiry. For philosophers specifically, there is an additional consideration. For decades, the contribution of philosophers to this debate has consisted mostly in providing alternative explanations for evidence seeming to support hereditarianism about race differences (see Sesardic, 2000, 2005), and advocating various kinds of restriction and censorship (see Cofnas, 2016). This may be because hereditarianism is controversial, and philosophers are strongly disincentivized from pursuing lines of argument that lead to truly controversial conclusions. Testifying to how serious this problem is, Jeff McMahan, Francesca Minerva, and Peter Singer recently founded the Journal of Controversial Ideas, which will allow scholars to publish pseudonymously. Singer (2017) commented that \u201cit\u2019s unfortunate that such a journal should ever be considered necessary to enable controversial ideas to be published, but perhaps we have got to the point where it is.\u201d It is not clear what kind of controversial ideas Singer had in mind, and the journal has not yet released its first issue, but it is hard to find a more controversial idea than hereditarianism about race differences in intelligence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There is a danger for the philosophical community in putting our credibility on the line over the claim that race differences are entirely environmental. If work on genetics and neuroscience within the next decade produces convincing evidence that differences in measured intelligence among groups have a significant genetic component, there will be no way to conceal this information. The hereditarian explanation will have to be accepted, and people will know that philosophers were on the wrong side of the issue both scientifically and morally: scientifically, because we are supposed to be careful, disinterested commentators on scientific controversies, not activists supporting only the politically popular side; morally, because we did not help lay the groundwork for responding in a moral way to these facts that we should have known might be coming.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "parentCommentId": "CGX7Gdb47QGTJoTSs", "user": {"username": "Maximilian Schlederer"}}, {"_id": "R8rv52N8dp9YBCeXx", "postedAt": "2023-01-14T23:05:00.240Z", "postId": "ALzE9JixLLEexTKSq", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>but I also think it's a bit unfair to point this out in the context of Kaspar Brandner sharing a lot of links after you did the same thing <i>first</i></p></blockquote><p>Yeah that's fair.

Much more important, however, is that respondents were not allowed to endorse what in my view is the only reasonable response: It is not possible to give a meaningful estimate of the percentage.</p></blockquote><p>This does not allow to claim consensus, and the way it's worded is obviously motivated by the desire to downplay the belief of experts in causal role of genetics. We have a newer survey they do not mention, too, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4804158/\">Survey of Expert Opinion on Intelligence: Causes of International Differences in Cognitive Ability Tests</a>, Rindermann, 2016:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Education was rated by <i>N</i> = 71 experts as the most important cause of international ability differences. Genes were rated as the second most relevant factor but also had the highest variability in ratings</p></blockquote><p>If anything, the consensus seems to be that genes play some role here.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>To anyone who sincerely wonders if there's anything to the \"race-iq realism\" theory, I ask you to consider this great point point made Ezra Klein to Sam Harris when Harris embraced The Bell Curve: very rarely will you see any serious consideration of the possibility that environmental factors explain &gt;100% of the black-white iq gap. &nbsp;In other words, on a purely genetic basis that black people may be more intelligent than white people is alien to the discourse.</p></blockquote><p>I do not see why this hypothetical is impressive? The best that could be said for it is that it is logically sound and novel. But &nbsp;heritability and norms of reaction impose limits on such explanations. If X percent of a trait's variance can be explained by a factor, then there's only so much you can get by changing the sum of non-X factors. Adult intelligence has roughly 80% heritability (equally within white and black populations; actually this alone invalidates the idea). For 1 d of difference in intelligence to be explained away by the environment, the gap in environmental quality must be 2.24 d. This is implausibly large for intra-national racial differences, contradicted by direct measures of environmental quality and indirect proxies of deprivation (such as stress and self-esteem), made suspect by the fact that there's been a great deal of improvement in race relations and equalization of living standards since the 60s, yet no large narrowing of the IQ gap; and for the case where black people have higher \"genotypic IQ\", environmental deprivation must be even greater than 2.24 d.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "YN85c93DD3EiNLFfo", "user": {"username": "MissionCriticalBit"}}, {"_id": "E8z7fnvfXxeLoCwbR", "postedAt": "2023-01-15T11:52:34.080Z", "postId": "ALzE9JixLLEexTKSq", "htmlBody": "<p>For information, CEA\u2019s OP links to an explanation of impartiality:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Impartial altruism: We believe that all people count equally.

I identify with the rationalist tradition as established on LW, feel sympathy for the ideal of effective altruism, respect Bostrom despite some disagreements, have donated to GiveWell charities on EA advice, but I have not participated more directly. Seeing the drama, people expressing disappointment and threatening to leave the community, and the volume of meta-discussion, I feel like clarifying a few details that may be hard to notice from within your current culture, and hopefully helping you mend the fracture that is currently getting filled with the race-iq stuff.</p><p>All else being equal, people who hang around such communities prefer consistent models (indeed, utilitarianism itself is a radical solution to inconsistencies in other ethical theories). This discourse is suffused with intellectual inconsistency, on many levels of varying contentiousness.</p><ul><li>On the faint level of moral intuitions, there's the strange beeline from the poorly supported prior that normalization of beliefs like Bostrom's will lead to bad effects like discrimination, to the consequentialist decision against entertaining them. It is not clear that Bostrom's beliefs are harmful in this way, or more likely to encourage a net increase in discrimination than their negation. Arguments from historical precedent have big problems with them: they do not address the direction of causality, or the fact that different cultures can have different reactions to the same information. As it is not considered normal in the modern culture to equate moral worth and ability for individuals of any group, it can be expected that the same will hold should the difference in ability between groups be acknowledged. Arguments from personal distress of users are valid points with regard to community health, but obviously (I hope) incommensurate with the question of global utility, and do not directly weigh on it. So the consequentialist case for not taking Bostrom's belief in good faith is already suspect.</li><li>Perhaps the most obvious level is that specific failings Bostrom is credibly accused of (racist attitude, belief in the racial IQ difference, belief in the validity of IQ measurement) do not depend on HBD. (He has done himself no favors by bringing up eugenics). So it's bizarre to see many people denounce his beliefs <i>in toto</i>, but support this denunciation <i>with environmentalist explanations of the IQ gap</i> \u2013 in effect, conceding the specific factual claim in Bostrom's old email, or at least demonstrating that it is not beyond the pale by their own standard. To be clear: it is not in doubt that the IQ gap between Black and White Americans exists; and that it is as predictive of outcomes associated with cognitive capacity as IQ measurement is (which is to say, highly predictive \u2013 and this, too, is mainstream consensus). People who act indignant about such statements send a huge red flag, demonstrating either general unwillingness to educate themselves or irrational ideological bias on this specific matter. People who bring up irrelevant anti-HBD talking points demonstrate confused reasoning.</li><li>Less obviously, the problem is portraying this as an open-and-shut case \u2013 a portrayal which doesn't really survive scrutiny. I don't know how to put this nicely, but what your list most reminds me of is polemics of sophisticated Creationists in the heyday of New Atheism. It's a mix of true but irrelevant, misleadingly phrased, blatantly misinterpreting and patently false claims. Instrumentally they are gotchas; structurally, opening moves aimed at people who are not familiar with the debate and are not aware that all those issues had long been answered, and the debate is incredibly mature. Of course, in all such debates both sides can assert that they've solved every vulnerability, and this forum isn't some HBD Central. So I won't compete in citations, and will just address things a total layman, provided he's minimally erudite, napkin-numerate, capable of critical thought and aware of basic logical fallacies, could spot, if he were so inclined. You way \"Now you might want to attack one of these (and feel free to send me a message), but even if you're right, that would still leave more than enough reasons to stay away from HBD.\" What if we go through every one of these?</li></ul><ol><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Population_bottleneck#Humans\">Human biodiversity is actually pretty low.

How would we even tell \u2013 do we have anything like IQ for other species? Does this genetic fact establish some prior for the magnitude in differences in measurable phenotypic traits between groups? What about individuals? What we <i>do</i> know that people with a priori negligible \"biodiversity\" \u2013 as in, children in ethnically endogamous marriages, even in isolated villages \u2013 routinely have large differences in all traits of interest. So how much diversity is needed, really, to introduce some measurable population-level divergence? Likewise for the point about bottlenecks, what of it? Should our layman just conclude that this is an authoritative-sounding technical term?</li><li><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identical_ancestors_point\">Human migrations over the last thousand years have been such that literally everyone on Earth is a descendant of literally everyone that lived 7000 years ago whose offspring didn't die out.

Aha, here's where your figure comes from: <i>\"Rohde, Olson and Chang showed through simulations that, <strong>given the false assumption of random mate choice without geographic barriers</strong>, the Identical Ancestors Point for all humans would be surprisingly recent, on the order of 5,000-15,000 years ago.\"</i> But it is indeed false, there <i>were</i> barriers for the entire history of our species, such as oceans; and how do migrations of the last millenium negate it? More importantly, it's a quantitative issue. Your link goes on to say: <i>\"Thus, even though the Norwegian and Japanese person share the same set of ancestors, these ancestors appear in their family tree in dramatically different proportions. A Japanese person in 5000&nbsp;BC with present-day descendants will likely appear trillions of times in a modern-day Japanese person's family tree, but might appear only one time in a Norwegian person's family tree.\"</i> Seeing as every specimen can have novel genetic variants, this should allow for arbitrary magnitude of divergence, no?</li><li><a href=\"http://pscourses.ucsd.edu/ps108/4%20What%20is%20race/Achenbach%202009-%20Study%20finds%20Africans%20more%20genetically%20diverse.pdf\">Africans have more genetic diversity than literally every other ethnicity on earth taken together, so any classification that separates \"Africans\" from other groups is going to be suspect.</a> \u2013 misleading. The money quote is: <i>\"Tishkoff and her colleagues studied DNA markers from around the planet, identifying 14 \"ancestral clusters\" for all of humanity. Nine of those clusters are in Africa. \"You're seeing more diversity in one continent than across the globe,\" Tishkoff said.\"</i> Okay, let's assume that those 9 clusters are meaningfully different (as are the other 5). When people talk of \"Africans\", in practice, whom do they refer to? <a href=\"https://razib.substack.com/p/out-of-africas-midlife-crisis\">Looking it up,</a></li></ol><blockquote><p><i>\"The very-diverse are hunter-gatherer populations who live in clusters scattered across Central and Southern Africa, in Namibia, Botswana, the Congo and a dozen other nations. They include the Khoi, the San, the Mbuti, the Mbenga, the Twa and the Hadza. [...] Save for that isolated half-million very-diverse hunter-gatherer minority, all Sub-Saharan Africans constitute the genetically in-between group of 1.14 billion not-very-diverse humans. [...] The founder population of today\u2019s genetically not-very-diverse Sub-Saharan Africans shows signatures of a population crash, probably with a toll of 50% and probably from an effective breeding population of something like 50,000 people down to 25,000. So out of a founding population on the scale of a very small city 60,000-120,000 years ago, today\u2019s 1.14 billion Sub-Saharan Africans have gone on to people every habitable space of that hugely varied continent. They are significantly more genetically diverse than their relatives on five other continents, but nowhere near as diverse as the neighbors in their midst. [...] 93-98.5% of the ancestry of humans outside of Sub-Saharan Africa (among those with no recent Sub-Saharan African ancestry, obviously) derives from a breeding population of 1,000 to 10,000, which expanded rapidly 60,000 years ago.\"</i><br>So this tells us that a) this measure of diversity is mostly sensitive to minimal sizes of ancient populations, b) people descending from most of those diverse clusters constitute a tiny fraction of African population, and are thus non-central cases of colloquial \"Africans\", c) the overwhelming majority of people of SSA ancestry descend from a single breeding population, which can be distinguished from other populations \u2013 including the one that had left Africa. The story is more complex, but the point is that this diversity appears not to be a good reason to not recognize [the majority of] Africans as a specific separate group.</p></blockquote><p>4. <a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/race-is-a-social-construct-scientists-argue/\">Race isn't a valid construct, genetically speaking. It's not well defined\".</a> \u2013 but aren't we already talking of genomic ancestry? So this is a true but irrelevant objection. Now, people are of course free to believe that conventional self-reported \"races\", which are, as is often correctly said, social constructs, do not correspond to continental-level ancestry \u2013 although noisily in many cases. I think this is pretty absurd on its face, but anyway, Googling <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3285495/\">tells us</a> <i>\"In mothers self-identified as Black and White, the imputed ancestry proportions were 77.6% African and 75.1% European respectively\"</i> in a \"diverse\" NYC sample, and I'd expect less cosmopolitan groups to show higher figures. However unfit race is for purposes of cutting-edge research, in the aggregate data it is robustly aligned with ancestry, which <i>is</i> well-defined.</p><p>5. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/0706.3639.pdf\">Intelligence is not well defined. There's no single definition of intelligence on which people from different fields can agree.</a> \u2013 blatantly misinterpreting. The cited paper states: <i>\"...Nevertheless, some definitions are clearly more concise, precise and general than others. Furthermore, it is clear that many of the definitions listed above are strongly related to each other and share many common features\"</i> and goes on to propose a unified definition: <i>\u201cIntelligence measures an agent\u2019s ability to achieve goals in a wide range of environments.\u201d Features such as the ability to learn and adapt, or to understand, are implicit in the above definition as these capacities enable an agent to succeed in a wide range of environments.</i> Also it is not clear why we'd even need people from different fields (in this case, psychology and AI research!) to agree on a definition of intelligence to have a useful measurement of human smarts. And this is what has happened with IQ:</p><p>6. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient#Validity_as_a_measure_of_intelligence\">IQ has a number of flaws. It is by definition Gaussian without having appeared empirically first and the g construct itself has almost certainly no neurological basis and is purely an artifact of factor analysis.</a> \u2013 this is just some Gish Gallop. To begin with, I don't see your link supporting your summarization \u2013 except the vague \"number of flaws\". If I may, where have you taken this list from? In any case, anything but God has a number of flaws; your link says that <i>\"According to Weiten, \"IQ tests are valid measures of the kind of intelligence necessary to do well in academic work.\"\"</i> and <i>\"clinical psychologists generally regard IQ scores as having sufficient&nbsp;statistical validity&nbsp;for many clinical purposes\".</i> It doesn't seem like there's any scientific objection as to the validity of IQ as a measurement of what's casually called smarts and understood to be smarts in the context of this discussion \u2013 even though there are weird attempts to drown this fact in caveats. Why is the part about assumed Gaussian even relevant? What would it mean for <i>g</i> to have a neurological basis, and why would that matter in the discussion of HBD? ...And the part about g being \"purely an artifact of factor analysis\" is plain false, far as I can tell. It comes from <a href=\"http://bactra.org/weblog/523.html\">Cosma Shalizi's essay</a> that misstates the reason for the existence of positive manifold. <i>\"If I take any group of variables which are positively correlated, there will, as a matter of algebraic necessity, be a single dominant general factor... Since intelligence tests are made&nbsp;to correlate with each other, it follows trivially that there must appear to be a general factor of intelligence.\"</i> This is just a lie: a great deal of effort has been devoted to making cognitive tests comprehensive and diverse assessments of ability, but positive correlations <a href=\"https://humanvarieties.org/2013/04/03/is-psychometric-g-a-myth/\">pop out on their own</a>, even in research informed by Shalizi's assumptions, e.g. <i>\"The WJ-R was developed based on the idea that the&nbsp;g&nbsp;factor is a statistical artifact with no psychological relevance. Nevertheless, all of its subtests are intercorrelated and, when factor analyzed, it reveals a general factor that is no less prominent than those of more traditional IQ tests\"</i>. And <i>\"...All 861 correlations are positive. Subtests of each IQ battery correlate positively not only with each other but also with the subtests of the other IQ batteries. This is, of course, something that the developers of the three different batteries could not have planned \u2013 and even if they could have, they would not have had any reason to do so, given their different theoretical presuppositions.\"</i></p><p>7. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twin_study#Criticism\">Twin studies are flawed in methodology</a><a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/identical-twins-can-have-slightly-different-dna-180976736/#:~:text=Research%20published%20on%20January%207,how%20scientists%20study%20human%20development.\">.

It does not weigh in on HBD and accepts the premise of variable genetic contributions to human intelligence: <i>As a case in point, consider that both&nbsp;genes&nbsp;and environment have the potential to influence intelligence. Heritability could increase if genetic variation increases, causing individuals to show more phenotypic variation, like showing different levels of intelligence. On the other hand, heritability might also increase if the environmental variation decreases, causing individuals to show less phenotypic variation</i>. This says, concretely, that in more equal environments we will observe more true genetic effects on variation in intelligence, so whatever differences in genetic effects on this trait there are between groups, they will become more pronounced. By the way this is terrible for the anti-HBD position because it means that the state of perfect environmental equality \u2013 one could say equality of opportunity \u2013 will collapse into genetic determinism (modulo random noise). Your own idea seems to be that non-genetic mechanisms of apparent heritability can be interrupted by a positive environmental intervention. What share of \"heritable\" variance can it explain, at a maximum? Like, concretely, to what extent do you think the racial IQ gap is explained by microbiota, epigenetic mechanisms and environmental stress on germinal cells? Those are all quantifiable and falsifiable claims, but you just gesture at them. At this point, a dedicated layman looks it up and sees that they can explain very little indeed.</p><p>10. <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jKVowgubMEg&amp;ab_channel=RebeccaWatson\">We don't mate randomly, which is an assumption in many genetics studies.</a> \u2013 irrelevant applause lights, \"genetics bad\". Which studies, and does this matter for HBD? I've watched the video; it discusses interactions between psychiatric disorders and such, and states that genetic correlations between traits may be inflated by assortative mating (i.e. people high in trait X marry people high in trait Y). Genetic correlation <i>\"is defined as&nbsp;the proportion of the heritability that is shared between two traits divided by the square root of the product of the heritability for each trait\"</i>. What is meant here, concretely? Ancestry is not really a \"heritable trait\", is it? And race is just a category, plus a bad proxy for ancestry, as far as HBD is concerned.</p><p>11. <a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/2qfkt/\">HBD is not generally accepted in academia.</a> \u2013 this is just an appeal to authority, plus misleading. It's a single highly technical paper by some Kevin Bird, \"Department of Horticulture Michigan State University\", can it be considered an authoritative source on what academia thinks? And from the abstract, it attacks a very strong form of HBD reasoning, using data that cannot plausibly be conclusive: <i>Evidence for selection was evaluated using an excess variance test. Education associated variants were further evaluated for signals of selection by testing for excess genetic differentiation (Fst).</i> Does it strike you as plausible that we know enough about \"education associated variants\" to impute effects of prehistoric selection on intelligence? This ought to mean that the science of genetics of intelligence is vastly more mature than people think, than you suggest, too, and that within-group intelligence heritability is understood really well! Why hasn't this made the news yet? (And how does this address obvious low-tech HBD arguments, such as admixture studies and adoption studies?)</p><p>12. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyril_Burt#Fraud_accusations\">Many public HBD figures have been found guilty of fraud. Cyril Burt would literally forge results, while Lynn would take the average of two neighboring countries' IQ in order to derive \"data\" from a country's unknown national IQ.</a> \u2013 That's an isolated demand for rigor. What field doesn't commit fraud? Were public anti-HBD figures never found guilty of fraud? Is the fraud rate different enough to affect our priors? And your link does not show that Burt's forgery was positively proven, but it admits that figures of heritability arrived at by independent researchers do not differ from Burt's, so why should we care? Assuming that a layman could track it down from here, I'll allow myself to quote Richard Haier (<i>The Neuroscience of Intelligence</i>, Cambridge University press, 2017): <i>Subsequent twin studies done by different investigators around the world with large samples arrive at an average value for the correlation of intelligence scores among identical twins raised apart of .75 (Plomin &amp; Petrill, 1997). Burt\u2019s value was .77. For comparison, based on 19 studies ranging in sample sizes between 26 and 1,300 identical twin pairs, the average value for identical twins raised together is about .86 (see Loehlin &amp; Nichols, 1976, table 4.10, p. 39)... Thus, the .771 \u201cfraud\u201d ends with recognition of overwhelming data from independent researchers that are fully consistent with Burt\u2019s analyses, flawed as they may have been. Any single study, or any one researcher, can be flawed, but the basic conclusion that genes play an important role in intelligence is consistently supported by data from numerous studies of twins, adoptees, and adopted twins. This is an excellent example of looking at the weight of evidence (recall my three laws from the Preface: no story is simple; no one study is definitive; it takes many years to sort out conflicting and inconsistent findings and establish a weight of evidence). ... The weight of evidence summarized in this chapter leaves no reasonable doubt. Only extreme ideologues are still in denial.</i> As for Lynn's country data, well, the same logic applies. Do we have any more trustworthy data? Does it refute Lynn's? Then why not just refer to it instead? Please don't say that it's not very interesting and nobody has bothered to collect proper measurements, IQ and race (or rather, ethnicity) is literally the most painful question in modern science, and it's evident from such dramas that a great many researchers are emotionally invested in proving the relationship wrong.</p><p>Ultimately, exposure to this sort of content has done for me what it has done for this person:</p><blockquote><p>[\u2026] Well, OK, I could believe that; visible traits consistent over entire populations like skin color might differ systematically because of sexual selection or something, but why not leave IQ following the exact same bell curve in each population? <strong>There was no specific thing here that made me start to wonder, more a gradual undermining</strong> (Gould\u2019s work like <a href=\"https://archive.md/o/Utkqw/en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The%20Mismeasure%20of%20Man\"><i>The Mismeasure of Man</i></a> &nbsp;being <a href=\"https://archive.md/o/Utkqw/www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001071\">completely dishonest</a> is one example - with enemies like that\u2026) as I continued to read studies and wonder why Asian model minorities did so well, <strong>and a lack of really convincing counter-evidence like one would expect the last two decades to have produced - given the politics involved - if the idea were false.</strong> And one can always ask oneself: suppose that intelligence was meaningful, and did have a large genetic component, and the likely genetic ranking East Asians &gt; Caucasian &gt; Africans; in what way would the world, or the last millennium (eg the growth of the Asian tigers vs Africa, or the different experiences of discriminated-against minorities in the USA), look different than it does now?<br>But having said that, and admiring things like Plantinga\u2019s free will defense, and the subtle logical issues in formulating it and the lack of any really concrete evidence for or against Jesus\u2019s existence, do I take the basic question of God seriously? No. <strong>The theists\u2019 rearguard attempts and ever more ingenious explanations and indirect pathways of reasons and touted miracles fundamentally do not add up to an existing whole</strong>. The universe does not look anything like a omni-benevolent/powerful/scient god was involved, a great deal of determined effort has failed to provide any convincing proof, there not being a god is consistent with all the observed processes and animal kingdom and natural events and material world we see, and so on. The persistence of the debate reflects more what motivated cognition can accomplish and the weakness of existing epistemology and debate.[\u2026]</p></blockquote><p>I want to make it perfectly clear: those question marks in my point-by-point do not actually indicate uncertainty. They could as well have been references to papers. The field really is about as advanced as Bird's study suggests \u2013 only in the direction he disapproves of. But this isn't the place for it, surely people can go to some edgier venue and ask for receipts. The point I'm trying to make is: you say \"Okay, if there's anyone here who actually believes in HBD, here's a couple reasons why you shouldn't.\" On an ignorant but moderately skeptical person your little list can, and likely will, have an effect that's the opposite of what you intend to achieve. To \"who actually believes in HBD\", it's utterly unconvincing. If I may be so blunt, it's almost as sad as quasi-scientific gotchas of flat earthers.</p><p>And this is how all of anti-HBD rhetoric is, in my experience. It crumbles under basic scrutiny, links do not show what they are purported to show, there are simple misunderstandings of what terms mean, there is no coherent epistemology or a single model, there's suppression of inconvenient evidence, there's substitution of evidence with confident op-eds in Vox from people who are supposed to be experts (but whose legitimate work doesn't support their confident claims), there are cascades of internally inconsistent Gish Gallops and other fallacies; worst of all, the reader is assumed to just not be all that bright. It's a collection of purely reactive objections that might come across as persuasive to like-minded people, but are not battle-tested \u2013 and indicate general unwillingness to test one's beliefs.</p><p>I expect very little payoff from this labor.

In one sense giving a begger a hundred dollars and giving a billionaire a hundred dollars is treating them equally, but only with respect to money. With respect to the important, fundamental things (improvement in wellbeing) the two are very unequal. I take it that the natural reading of \u201cequal\u201d is \u201cequal with respect to what matters\u201d, as otherwise it is trivial to point out some way in which any possible treatment of beings that differ in some respect must be unequal in some way (either you treat the two unequally with respect to money, or with respect to welfare for instance).</p>\n<p>The most radical view of equality of this sort, is that for any being for whom what matters can to some extent matter to them, one ought to treat them equally with respect to it, this is for instance the view of people like Singer, Bentham, and Sidgwick (yes, including non-human animals, which is <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/28GrG8iFBrKEHb27t/marginal-cases-on-trial\">my view</a> as well).

Again, you might disagree that Bostrom is failing to apply equal respect of this sort, or that this use of the word equality is not how you usually think of it, but I find it suspicious that so many people are boosting your comment given how common, even mundane a statement in EA philosophy ones like this are, and that the statement links directly to a page explaining it on the main EA website.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "pzYSBDmJwQYQcnniM", "user": {"username": "Devin Kalish"}}, {"_id": "HqYt3mr7fg7mAX6SH", "postedAt": "2023-01-16T14:04:54.480Z", "postId": "ALzE9JixLLEexTKSq", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>HBD is a hypothesis for how the world works, so the burden of proof is on HBD and giving a bad reason not to believe in HBD is not evidence&nbsp;<em>for</em>&nbsp;HBD.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This logic is only applicable to contrived scenarios where there is no prior knowledge at all \u2013 but you need some worldly knowledge to understand what both these hypotheses are about.<br>\nCrucially, there is the zero-sum nature of public debate. People deliberately publicizing reasons to <em>not believe</em> some politically laden hypothesis are not random sources of data found via unbiased search: they are expected to cherrypick damning weaknesses. They are also communicating standards of the intellectual tradition that stands by the opposing hypothesis. A rational layman starts with equal uncertainty about truth values of competing hypotheses, but learning that one side makes use of arguments that are blatantly unconvincing on grounds of mundane common sense can be taken as provisional evidence against their thesis even before increasing object-level certainty: poor epistemology is evidence against ability to discover truth, and low-quality cherrypicked arguments point to a comprehensively weak case. Again, consider beliefs generally known to be kooky, and what they bring to bear on the opposition. Their standard of rigor alone is discrediting to what they believe in.</p>\n<p>Moreover, I've established that, upon checking, some of your links positively provide evidence in favor of HBD, rather than against \u2013 at least by the standard of evidence implicit in the phrasing of the list. Returning again to the Identical Ancestors Point, is presented as an Anti-HBD finding in the first place because it implies a very low prior for genetic divergence of populations, migrations somehow averaging it all out: <em>Human migrations over the last thousand years have been such that literally everyone on Earth is a descendant of literally everyone that lived 7000 years ago whose offspring didn't die out</em>. (Is this the wrong takeaway? What, then, did you mean to say by adding it?) Looking into <a href=\"http://www.stat.yale.edu/~jtc5/papers/CommonAncestors/NatureCommonAncestors-Article.pdf\">the actual paper</a>, we see: <em>...For example, a present-day Norwegian generally owes the majority of his or her ancestry to people living in northern Europe at the IA point, and a very small portion to people living throughout the rest of the world. Furthermore, because DNA is inherited in relatively large segments from ancestors, an individual will receive little or no actual genetic inheritance from the vast majority of the ancestors living at the IA point</em>. Not only does this make the original argument invalid (even in a strong absolute sense \u2013 there can be <strong>zero</strong> common inheritance!) \u2013 it directly reinforces the HBD conjecture that long-term (i.e. pre-IAP) divergent local adaptation is relevant to current genetic (and trait) differences.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>LW has an empiricist tradition, the term 'rationalist' is a misnomer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I agree that this is improper and irritating terminology, because doctrinally, LW asserts its allegiance to empiricism, with all the talk about Bayes-updating on evidence and how rationalists must \"win\". But in practice this isn't so clear-cut: LW is fascinated with armchair thought experiments (that routinely count as evidence to update on), and all the attention devoted to infohazards, Pascal mugging, one-boxing, AI scenarios etc. suggests that they, as a living tradition, are not resilient to speculation the way pure empiricists \u2013 say, regular natural scientists \u2013 would be. So, not necessarily a misnomer.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the major ethical theories don't have any inconsistencies as far as I can tell</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>They are internally consistent, but I think the point of ethical theory is to clarify the intuitively knowable essence of moral action for purposes of nontrivial decisionmaking, not to assert what morality is and derive an arbitrary decision rule from there. Utilitarianism is often criticized for things like the repugnant conclusion, yet non-utilitarian ethical theories routinely produce more grating outputs, because they fail to capture the most significant part of intuitive ethics, which is mostly about harm reduction under conditions of resource scarcity. They are less consistent with ethics given to us in lived experience, so to speak.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>even if you don't know which way the arrow of causality points, that's still an unnecessarily big risk. It's not particularly altruistic to make statements that have that big a chance of helping racists. You could also spend your time... not doing that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>No, the extent of the purported risk matters. You are just falling back on the unsupported prior about cost-benefit ratio because you have preemptively excluded all factors that may change the qualitative conclusion of \"not doing that\". To give a specific example: under the assumption that HBD is wrong, we must consider disparate outcomes to be a result of some discrimination and devote resources to alleviate it; but if HBD is actually right, this'd necessarily mean that our costly attempts to help low-performing groups are suboptimal or futile (as in, not effective), and that we will have unfairly attributed blame, harming other groups psychologically and materially. Then there are knock-on effects of  harming science: for starters, fears of enabling racists can hold back genomic medicine (and population-specific treatment) by increasing hurdles to data collection and access. We do not have a priori knowledge as to which costs are negligible. On a more meta level, <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/10/23/kolmogorov-complicity-and-the-parable-of-lightning/\">Scott Alexander's parable comes to mind</a>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>there is still the entire field of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_racism\">linguistic racism</a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>IMO it's a weak argument because for all the racism, black Americans still report <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0095798406295096\">the highest self-esteem of all racial groups</a>; and theories of stereotype threat <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20190212220457/https://heterodoxacademy.org/is-stereotype-threat-overcooked-overstated-and-oversold/\">are apparently unsupported by high-quality data</a>; so it isn't clear what the odds are that some HBD research or whatever would harm people substantially. But even before that \u2013 there are laws against hate speech and discrimination, and they can be strengthened if needed; it seems very suboptimal to focus on not developing neutral knowledge only to deny hateful ideologies rhetorical ammo, instead of dealing with them directly. By the way, cannot racists <a href=\"https://www.chronicle.com/article/racial-pseudoscience-on-the-faculty\">point to censorship</a>as sufficient evidence of their correctness, if their intent is to spin available facts to their benefit? Actually, doesn't this enable them to \u2013 convincingly \u2013 claim that facts are <em>much worse</em> than they are, that the genomic gap in cognitive ability is bigger than the non-zero gap we'd have found (and, I believe, <em>have</em> partially found) with proper research (which is <a href=\"https://www.city-journal.org/nih-blocks-access-to-genetics-database\">currently prohibited</a>)? And in any case, you have to put racism-driven harms in the context of costs of pretending that HBD is certainly false \u2013 that is, under the assumption that we are \"just not doing that\" and have no clue whether it is or isn't true.</p>\n<p>As an aside, I am personally puzzled by the strong conviction of many that HBD becoming common knowledge could lead to normalization of racial discrimination. This is a normative, not scientific question. Societies with Social Darwinist values do not need HBD to embrace and exacerbate the status quo of disparate power. Societies with ethnocentric values opportunistically oppose and exploit ethnic outgroups regardless of relative merit. Mainstream modern value system depends on the premise of human <em>rights</em>, not equality of capability. We do not hold that it is normal to oppress individuals who are <em>known</em> to be below average in some morally neutral trait (except maybe for an expansive definition of \"oppress\" and clinical issues having to do with lack of legal capacity), we have a strong revulsion to identity-based discrimination, and we understand the unreasonableness of treating individuals on the basis of average values.<br>\nUncharitably, in the case of EA, this concern may have to do with the strain (common to EA and LW) of conspiratorial elitism and distrust in the democratic process, and with the unconscious belief that intelligence <em>does</em> define moral worth. That's ...not a very popular belief. I would deeply hate it if my cognitive betters acted like they have greater moral worth than myself, and therefore, to be fair, I cannot deny equal moral worth to people of lower ability. Most people correctly believe that they aren't brilliant, but they're not so dull as to not arrive at this logic. There are some contingent factors that complicate the picture, but not fundamentally.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the racist stereotyping does lead to black people being&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Welfare_queen#Impact_of_the_stereotype\">harmed both socially and economically</a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myth_of_meritocracy\">The myth of meritocracy</a>&nbsp;is strong, and people who are seen as unable to 'pull themselves up by their &nbsp;bootstraps' are looked down upon.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Without getting into the weeds of stereotype scholarship, the extent of claimed harms, and the <a href=\"https://nationalpost.com/news/canada/minority-professor-denied-grants-because-he-hires-on-merit-people-are-afraid-to-think\">irrational denial</a> of the role of merit in achievement (reasoning in that wiki page doesn't even begin to address what would happen in a \"proper\" meritocratic society after a few generations, because it is premised on genes not contributing to achievement; this is a typical case of an unexamined anti-HBD prior leading to policy errors)... I'll just say that in my opinion both those issues, insofar as they harm anyone, have to do with beliefs about moral qualities. If \"Protestant ethic\" is alive and prescribes vilification of people of lower morally neutral ability, then that is a problem in its own right and beyond the scope of this conversation. Luckily, Protestant ethic also encourages treating people on a case by case basis.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>What global utility?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Crucially, the search for interventions that actually close the IQ gap. As it stands, we have picked low-hanging fruit like lead exposure, malnutrition, iodine deficiency, parasites and such (in developed nations; I expect EA efforts in Africa to keep delivering on this front), and are left with pursuing dead ends of addressing iniquity like the \"food deserts\" nonsense, or doubling down on stuff like school spending, that has long ran into diminishing or zero returns and is only popular because to point out its inefficacy means to risk being labeled racist. <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09515089.2019.1697803\">As Nathan Cofnas argues,</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>...But the reason that these programs, which Kourany rightly says ought to exist, have never been created is not because of racism but because of the taboo on talking about genetic differences among policy makers.

It's not fair to act indignant about an unflattering comparison after doing that. Even so, I've made peace with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brandolini's_law\">Brandolini's law</a>, and kept addressing those claims on the object level, to substantiate my \"very civil\" summary and so that \"EAs were to become a little more reserved on this topic, and at least stopped turning off potential recruits with irrefutable displays of irrationality.\" To be honest your reaction isn't wholly unexpected, but I did hope that I've been polite enough to merit some tolerance.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Yeah I'm out.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>OK but please think of your stated desire is to persuade those who happen to believe in HBD to disbelieve it.

If nothing else, that could help you understand how this can happen.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you want to do good, why would you ever, in our world, spread these views?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Personally \u2013 because I do, in fact, believe that you are profoundly wrong, that even historically these views did not contribute to much harm (despite much misinformation concocted by partisans: policies we know to be harmful are attributable to different systems of views); that, in general, any thesis about systematic relation in the pattern {views I don't like}=&gt;{atrocities} is highly suspect and should be scrutinized (e.g. with theists who attribute Stalin's brutality to atheism, or derive all of morality from their particular religion); and that my views offer a reliable way to reduce the amount of suffering humans are subjected to, in many ways from optimizing allocation of funds to  unlocking advances in medical and educational research to mitigating  slander and gaslighting heaped upon hundreds of millions of innocent people.</p>\n<p>Crucially, because I believe that, all that medium-term cost-benefit analysis aside, the process of maintaining views you assume are beneficial constitutes an X-risk (actually a family of different X-risks, in Bostrom's own classification), by comprehensively corrupting the institution of science and many other institutions. In other words: I think there is no plausible scenario where we achieve substantially more human flourishing in a hundred years \u2013 or ever \u2013 while deluding ourselves about the blank slate; that it's you who is infecting others with the \"Basilisk\" thought virus. And that, say, arguments about the terrible history of some tens of thousands of people whom Americans have tortured under the banner of eugenics \u2013 after abusing and murdering millions of people whilst being first ignorant, then in denial about natural selection \u2013 miss the point entirely, both the point of effective altruism and of rational debate.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If the impact of spreading these views is more tragedies happening, more suffering, and more people dying early, please consider these views an infohazard and don't even talk about them unless you're absolutely sure your views are not going to spread to people who'll become more intolerant- or more violent.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is an impossible standard and you probably know it. Risks of a given strategy must be assessed in the context of the full universe of its alternatives; else the party that gets to cherrypick which risks are worth bringing up can insist on arbitrary measures. By the way, I could provide nontrivial evidence that your views have contributed to making a great number of people more intolerant and more violent, and have caused <em>thousands of excess deaths over the last three years</em>; but,  unlike your wholly hypothetical fearmongering, it's likely to get me banned.</p>\n<p>Indeed, I could ask in the same spirit: what makes people upvote <em>you</em>? If your logic of cherrypicking risks and demonizing comparative debate is sound, then why don't they just disregard GiveWell and donate all of their savings to the first local pet shelter that gets to pester them with heart-rending  imagery of suffering puppies? Maybe they like puppies to suffer?!
