I cannot stand the framing of everything through Newman's dubious concept of development of dogma, which IMO is a slow-motion bomb blowing up Catholic orthodoxy. In fact I don't see that this adds anything to the piece, which stands perfectly well without it! &nbsp;All your excellent points about the antiquity of Christian acceptance of a long timeframe between the life of the Lord and his Second Coming work fine without this bizarre insistence that unchanging dogma develops according to completely arbitrary and post hoc criteria of authenticity. For modern Catholicism, of course, with its fixation on the theological authority of the Pope, this sort of thing is quite nice because ultimately both Newman and his modern interpreters simply made the authoritarian turn down the road of church history and turned authentic doctrinal development a simple matter of \"whatever Rome wills\", but this is IMO historically unsupportable and an evangelistic disaster.<br><br>Another nitpick: 'and even a committed Augustinian notion of perseverance as entirely God\u2019s gift maintains that \u201ca man who does not persevere fails by his own fault.\u201d' - I think a secular audience will misunderstand this. Augustine's \"fault\" is the fallen nature of man: it is not a personal capacity of any individual. Man sins through his own inherited weakness &nbsp;and natural propensity towards sin- the \"fault\" - but can only do good through the grace of God. But I think nowadays this is widely misinterpreted as saying that human nature is morally neutral and individual persons simply make good or bad choices in some kind of vacuum, whereas the Augustinian position is that all of us are born defective, entirely irredeemably so absent the grace of God and so we will inevitably choose the bad. I'm sure you know this perfectly well, of course, but I think this audience will not.<br><br>But again, these are minor nitpicks. To add some more scriptural evidence to the contention that Christian longtermism is theologically viable: Genesis 15:5, where we can, I think, read the text as God showing Abraham all the stars of the universe, by a special grace of extraordinary vision. This would, I think, imply 300 billion trillion descendants of Abraham, which the Earth could never support, so logically I think this must imply an eventual inter-Galactic &nbsp;Empire. In Haggai 2:9, of course, God promises that \"the glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the former\", which we can read as narrowly referring to the rebuilt Temple, more broadly as referring to the New Testament, but which we might read even more broadly as a perpetual promise of the slow ascent of man, up the skyscrapers, towards the stars, and towards the great eventual reunion with the divine. These are, I admit, more speculative readings, but somewhere from heaven I like to think Origen smiles down on them.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Sabs"}}, {"_id": "nCFyN7Kquzvjq4BJD", "postedAt": "2022-11-03T10:40:22.288Z", "postId": "EWiCySDcLSyiHTRQn", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you for sharing your response.

You may be correct that providence must be reconciled with responsibility; but the idea of a species-level extinction event seems to me incompatible with <i>any</i> conception of providence.

'Compatibilism' is thus less a position in the debate than the presupposition that makes the debate meaningful in the first place. But you identify the position that agency is compatible with providence with a particular model of the relationship between those two (a model influenced by secular free-will compatibilism), implicitly begging the question against all other models.</p>\n<p>Your model implicitly presumes that, when Christ prophecies that he shall return and judge the living (and the dead), the fact that 'the living' are still around is fully the causal responsibility of human beings\u2014in the nearest (im)possible world where everyone dies before the parousia, nothing about God would have to be different, only some facts about humans. As you had it, prophecies are about agency.</p>\n<p>I think this is false on its strongest readings: prophecies are partly about divine providence. And divine providence cannot just mean that the deist god set everything up just right in the beginning such that everything just worked out as planned; it has to mean that God is actively working in his creation, as is Christian dogma. In this case, in the (im) possible world where the gates of Hades really do prevail against the church and creation is destroyed, some facts about God and his providence must be different - he must be acting in a different way. Your model, I think, is incompatible with Christian dogma, although it might be compatible with other religions (e.g., I think Islam might be closer to this, although I'm no expert).</p>\n<p>To put it slightly differently, what you call 'pre-compatibilist confusions' are exactly what are necessary for this debate, because secular compatibilism is just the position that arises when you start to ignore divine providence and only bare impersonal determinism remains. Compatibilists all deny that impersonal determinism is at all analogous to some agent intervening in the causal structure (this is part of what it means to be a compatibilist); but divine providence <em>is</em> kinda analogous to that. If you want to call this position a 'pre-compatibilist confusion', you are committed to seeing all views on which God is active in his creation as inherently confused.

But that's where you differ from Christianity. OP is a Catholic, and it is part of Catholic dogma that miracles are happening all throughout the world right to this day. It is, for example, one of the criteria for sainthood that (excepting cases of martyrdom) the candidate for sainthood must have performed verifiable miracles in their lives. The Vatican often takes this requirement <i>very </i>seriously indeed, sending teams of serious and seemingly-rational men to investigate every facet of the purported miracles; and in a lot of cases - not most, but many - these men are satisfied that the miracle did indeed occur. The most recent canonisations occurred just last month. 'Miracle' here isn't 'nice thing that happened because of the saint that might seem supernatural but could just be surprising'; it is <i>defined</i> as an event 'which can only be attributed to divine power'.</p><p>You might try to explain it away, by saying that the Vatican is just keeping up appearances and the Catholic hierarchy doesn't <i>really</i> believe in constant supernatural intervention in the world; but I think this is pretty unsustainable when you actually look closely at how the people in question behave. This might seem odd to you, but it's a matter of fact that this all happens.</p><p>Things are slightly different in other Christian denominations (Protestantism is especially diverse and thus weird), but in general the belief in some kind of divine providence is shared dogma across all different versions of mainstream (Nicene/Chalcedonian) Christianity. Trying to rationalise Christian belief as 'well I guess they must be compatibilist deists' isn't being charitable, it's potentially offensive as well as philosophically incorrect. It might be hard for you to understand that people genuinely do believe in ongoing divine intervention in the world, but that's what it is.</p><blockquote><p>Could you unpack \"<strong>Compatibilists </strong>all deny that <strong>impersonal determinism </strong>is at all analogous to some agent intervening in the causal structure (this is part of what it means to be a compatibilist)\" a bit?</p></blockquote><p>Contrast your earlier example (you are writing a comment, and you are certain that you are going to finish it <i>because</i> that's what you want to do) with an example of coercion (you are writing a comment, and you are certain that you are going to finish it <i>because</i> someone has a gun to your head and is forcing you to write it). In the latter example, there is obviously some sense in which you are 'unfree'; everyone, except maybe Thomas Hobbes, would agree with that. In the former example, incompatibilists would tend to argue that you are also unfree: if you are able to be <strong>certain</strong>, your decision must be pre-determined in some sense, and this makes you unfree. Compatibilists, however, insist that the former case is not like the latter case: while you are unfree when an agent intervenes in the causal structure of your decision, you are perfectly free when you are 'determined' by the causal structure itself.</p><p>The point that I was making is just that God's providence is more like the former than the latter: it's an instance of some agent <i>intervening</i> in the causal order of your decision, not the causal structure just playing itself out. But Christians, of course, can't say that it's <i>entirely</i> analogous to the gun-to-the-head case, since they want to say that providence is compatible with free agency. So the philosophical question for Christians is how to combine human freedom with divine intervention in the world. This is an entirely different question from the compatibilism question in secular philosophy, which asks how free will might work if we just ignored God or denied that he existed. In that case, issues about divine intervention fall away, and the only question is whether you are free if the initial set-up of the universe was <i>just so</i> such that your decision was in a certain sense 'pre-determined'. As you write, 'that is my relationship with nature'. <i>Nature</i>, sure; but not the Christian God.</p>", "parentCommentId": "JK5ZEvcEBMhWi5zKi", "user": {"username": "Peter McLaughlin"}}, {"_id": "CHhBr2trNio5jE9bD", "postedAt": "2022-11-07T02:46:41.315Z", "postId": "EWiCySDcLSyiHTRQn", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>You might try to explain it away</p></blockquote><p>I wouldn't, I didn't realize they were recognizing new saints!

This is a repeated theme, for example, in Christ's parables. Now, there is a serious theological problem about how we might reconcile this revealed truth with God's providence and hope for our salvation; but, as you mention, there are serious proposals for how to answer this question. But (importantly) the question only arises because the Holy Spirit has revealed to us, through scripture, that not all shall be saved. It's part of our duty to puzzle out the mystery of <i>how</i> this might be true; but it is not up to us to doubt that it <i>is</i> true.</p><p>By contrast, when we turn to the case of (b) the revelation of scripture is <i>not</i> that humanity might go extinct before the parousia. Indeed, I think there are many verses which seem plainly to have the implication that this is not a real possibility. This is not a case where God <i>hopes</i> for something to come about, but rather one where he has declared that it <i>will </i>come about: Christ will come again to judge the living and the dead. This is not a case where we're asking how something that God has revealed <i>is </i>true, <i>might be </i>true; we're essentially asking how it <i>might not</i> be true.

But none of these cases seem exactly analogous to me. And I think secular thinking about existential risk has been informed, to such an immense degree, by assumptions incompatible with Christianity (e.g., as <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/to-imagine-our-own-extinction-is-to-be-able-to-answer-for-it\">Thomas Moynihan has emphasised</a>, the separation of fact from value) that it's an insurmountable challenge to try to turn back around and integrate it into Christianity.</p>", "parentCommentId": "nHCAzTppHkodWGsmt", "user": {"username": "Peter McLaughlin"}}, {"_id": "ZM9tPdQumDY4itEsc", "postedAt": "2022-11-10T12:11:06.332Z", "postId": "EWiCySDcLSyiHTRQn", "htmlBody": "<p>Important point - religions evolve.
