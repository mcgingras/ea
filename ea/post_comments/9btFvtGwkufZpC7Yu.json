The letter is also attracting a reasonable amount of media attention this morning.&nbsp;<br><br>It's hard to overstate how backwards the Australian government's leadership is on AI safety concerns at this point in time. If things continue as they are, it's essentially certain that the Australian government is going to be a skeptical voice in any multilateral negotiations relating to global agreements and standards setting etc. Given Australia's geopolitical position, it would meaningfully harm global efforts if Australia is pulling in the wrong direction.<br><br>I'm really hopeful that this effort will have a meaningful impact in Australia correcting course. This is a great start, but it will require sustained effort.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Greg S"}}]
