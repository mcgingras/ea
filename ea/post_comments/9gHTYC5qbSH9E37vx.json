Being willing to give 100 million and not needing anything like certainty for that. We\u2019re not in a position where we\u2019re like, \u201cIf you want this level of funding, you better effectively have proof that what you\u2019re going to do is great.\u201d We\u2019re happy to give a lot with not that much evidence and not that much conviction \u2014 if we think it\u2019s, in expectation, great. Maybe it\u2019s worth doing more research, but maybe it\u2019s just worth going for. I think that is something where it\u2019s a different style, it\u2019s a different brand. And we, I think in general, are pretty comfortable going out on a limb for what seems like the right thing to do.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rob Wiblin: OK, so with that out of the way, what\u2019s a mistake you think at least some nontrivial fraction of people involved in effective altruism are making?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>SBF: Then the last thing is thinking about grantmaking. This is definitely a philosophical difference that we have as a grantmaking organization. And I don\u2019t know that we\u2019re right on it, but I think it\u2019s at least interesting how we think about it. Let\u2019s say we evaluate a grant for 48 seconds. After 48 seconds, we have some probability distribution of how good it\u2019s going to be, and it\u2019s quite good in expected value terms. But we don\u2019t understand it that well; there\u2019s a lot of fundamental questions that we don\u2019t know the answer to that would shift our view on this.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Then we think about it for 33 more seconds, and we\u2019re like, \u201cWhat might this probability distribution look like after 12 more hours of thinking?\u201d And in 98% of those cases, we would still decide to fund it, but it might look materially different. We might have material concerns if we thought about it more, but we think they probably won\u2019t be big enough that we would decide not to fund it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rob Wiblin: Save your time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>SBF: Right. You can spend that time, do that, or you could just say, \u201cGreat, you get the grant, because we already know where this is going to end up.\u201d But you say that knowing that there are things you don\u2019t know and could know that might give you reservations, that might turn out to make it a mistake. But from an expected value of impact perspective \u2014</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rob Wiblin: It\u2019s best just to go ahead.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>SBF: Yeah, exactly. I think that\u2019s another example of this, where being completely comfortable doing something that in retrospect is a little embarrassing. They\u2019ll go, \u201cOh geez, you guys funded that. That was obviously dumb.\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cYeah, you know, I don\u2019t know.\u201d That\u2019s OK.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Rob Wiblin: Yeah. It\u2019s so easy to get stuck in that case, where you are just unwilling to do anything that might turn out to be negative.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>SBF: Exactly. And a lot of my response in those cases is like, \u201cLook, I hear your concerns. I want you to tell me \u2014 in writing, right now \u2014 whether you think it is positive or negative expected value to take this action. And if you write down positive, then let\u2019s do it. If you write down negative, then let\u2019s talk about where that calculation\u2019s coming from.\u201d And maybe it will be right, but let\u2019s at least remove the scenario where everyone agrees it\u2019s a positive EV move, but people are concerned about some\u2026</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Notably, the FTX Foundation's <a href=\"https://ftxfuturefund.org/our-regrants/\">regranting program</a> \"gave over 100 people access to discretionary budget\" (and I'm not aware of them using a reasonable mechanism to resolve the obvious <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/unilateralist-s-curse\">unilateralist's curse</a> problem).
