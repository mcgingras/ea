I think about 8 out of 32 of our participants from our Fall 2021 intro program plan on pursuing a high-impact career. Overall, I\u2019m feeling optimistic about how much new EA university groups can grow and about how many university students the community can get engaged with EA!</p><p>I also think that at major CS universities, we can get a good number of people participating in the AI Safety Fundamentals alignment program, and I\u2019d be excited to see more AI safety club activities at other universities.

A survey of our alumni showed that the advantages were smaller than hypothesized. In addition, we stumbled on some unanticipated difficulties during the year. In this post, we will briefly refresh your memory on our initial line of thinking, followed by our experiences of the year.

In brief, I entirely agree with Matt Yglesias that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Returns to additional money are certainly not linear at large scales, which counsels in favour of risk aversion.</li>\n<li>Returns become sublinear more quickly when you're working on more niche cause areas like longtermism, relative to larger cause areas such as global poverty alleviation.</li>\n<li>This sublinearity becomes especially pronounced when you're considering giving on the scale of billions rather than millions of dollars.</li>\n<li>There are other major practical considerations that point in favour of risk-aversion as well.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>(SBF appears to think the effects above are smaller than Matt or I do, but it's hard to know exactly what he believes, so I'll set that aside here.)</p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p>\n<p>The offending paragraphs in the original post were:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"If you were offered a 100% chance of $1 million to keep yourself, or a 10% chance of $15 million \u2014 it makes total sense to play it safe. You\u2019d be devastated if you lost, and barely happier if you won.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But if you were offered a 100% chance of donating $1 billion, or a 10% chance of donating $15 billion, you should just go with whatever has the highest expected value \u2014 that is, probability multiplied by the goodness of the outcome [in this case $1.5 billion] \u2014 and so swing for the fences.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This is the totally rational but rarely seen high-risk approach to philanthropy championed by today\u2019s guest, Sam Bankman-Fried. Sam founded the cryptocurrency trading platform FTX, which has grown his wealth from around $1 million to $20,000 million.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The point from the conversation that I wanted to highlight \u2014 and what is clearly true \u2014 is that for an individual who is going to spend the money on themselves, the fact that one quickly runs out of any useful way to spend the money to improve one's well-being makes it far more sensible to receive $1 billion with certainty than to accept a 90% chance of walking away with nothing.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if you plan to spend the money to help others, such as by distributing it to the world's poorest people, then the good one does by dispersing the first dollar and the billionth dollar are much closer together than if you were spending them on yourself. That greatly strengthens the case for taking the risk of receiving nothing in return for a larger amount on average, relative to the personal case.</p>\n<p>But: the impact of the first dollar and the billionth dollar aren't identical, and in fact could be very different, so calling the approach 'totally rational' was somewhere between an oversimplification and an error.</p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p>\n<p>Before we get to that though, we should flag a practical consideration that is as important, or maybe more so, than getting the shape of the returns curve precisely right.</p>\n<p>As Yglesias points out, once you have begun a foundation and people are building organisations and careers in the expectation of a known minimum level of funding for their field, there are particular harms to risking your entire existing endowment in a way that could leave them and their work stranded and half-finished.</p>\n<p>While in the hypothetical your downside is meant to be capped at zero, in reality, 'swinging for the fences' with all your existing funds can mean going far <em>below</em> zero in impact.</p>\n<p>The fact that many risky actions can result in an outcome far worse than what would have happened if you simply did nothing, is a reason for much additional caution, one that we wrote about in a 2018 piece titled <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/accidental-harm/\">'Ways people trying to do good accidentally make things worse, and how to avoid them'</a>. I regret that I failed to ask any questions that highlighted this critical point in the interview.</p>\n<p>(This post won't address the many other serious issues raised by the risk-taking at FTX, which, according to news reports, have gone far beyond accepting the possibility of not earning much profit, and which can't be done justice here.</p>\n<p>If those reports are accurate, the risk-taking at FTX was not just a coin flip that came up tails \u2014 it was immoral and perhaps criminal itself due to the misappropriation of other people's money for the purpose of risky investments. This has resulted in incalculable harm to customers, investors, trust in broader society, and has set back all the causes some of FTX's staff said they wanted to help.)</p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p>\n<p>To return to the question of declining returns and risk aversion \u2014 just as one slice of pizza is delicious but a tenth may not be enjoyable to eat at all, people trying to use philanthropy to do good do face 'declining marginal returns' as they incrementally try to give away more and more money.</p>\n<p>How fast that happens is a difficult empirical question.</p>\n<p>But if one is funding the fairly niche and neglected problems SBF said he cared the most about, it's fair to say that any foundation would find it difficult to disperse $15 billion to projects they were incredibly excited about.</p>\n<p>That's because a foundation with $15 billion would end up being a majority of funding for those areas, and so effectively increase the resources going towards them by more than 2-fold, and perhaps as much as 5-fold, depending on how broad a net they tried to cast. That 'glut' of funding would result in some more mediocre projects getting the green light.</p>\n<p>Assuming someone funded projects starting with the ones they believed would have the most impact per dollar, and then worked down \u2014 the last grant made from such a large pot of money will be clearly worse, and probably have less than half the expected social impact per dollar as the first.</p>\n<p>So between $1 billion with certainty versus a 10% chance of $15 billion, one could make a theoretical case for either option \u2014 but if it were me I would personally lean towards taking the $1 billion with certainty.[1]</p>\n<p>Notice that by contrast, if I were weighing up a guaranteed $1 <em>million</em> against a 10% chance of $15 <em>million</em>, the situation would be very different. For the sectors I'd be most likely to want to fund, $15 million from me, spread out over a period of years, would represent less than a 1% increase, and so wouldn't overwhelm their capacity to sensibly grow, leading the marginal returns to decline more slowly. So in that case, setting aside my personal interests, I would opt for the 10% chance of $15 million.</p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p>\n<p>Another massive real-world consideration we haven't mentioned yet which pushes in favour of risk aversion is the following: how much you are in a position to donate is likely to be strongly correlated with how much other donors are able to donate.</p>\n<p>In practice risk-taking around philanthropy will mostly centres on investing in businesses. But businesses tend to do well and poorly together, in cycles, depending on broad economic conditions. So if your bets don't pay off, say, because of a recession, there's a good chance other donors will have less to give as well. As a result, you can't just take the existing giving of other donors for granted.</p>\n<p>This is one reason for even small donors to have a reasonable degree of risk aversion. If they all adopt a risk-neutral strategy they may all get hammered at once and have to massively reduce their giving simultaneously, adding up to a big negative impact in aggregate.</p>\n<p>This is a huge can of worms that has been written about by <a href=\"https://rationalaltruist.com/2013/02/28/risk-aversion-and-investment-for-altruists/\">Christiano</a> and <a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/when-should-altruists-be-financially-risk-averse/#Why_risk_neutrality_is_never_completely_true\">Tomasik</a> as far back as 2013, and more recently <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ben_j_todd/status/1459132280803368962\">by my colleague Benjamin Todd</a>.</p>\n<p>\u2014\u2014\u2014</p>\n<p>This post has only scratched the surface of the analysis one could do on this question, and attempted to show how tricky it can be. For instance, we haven't even considered:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Uncertainty about how many other donors might join or drop out of funding similar work in future.</li>\n<li>Indirect impacts from people funding similar work on adjacent projects.</li>\n<li>Uncertainty about which problems you'll want to fund solutions to in future.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I regret having swept those and other complications under the rug for the sake of simplicity in a way that may well have confused some listeners to the show and seemed like an endorsement of an approach that is risk-neutral with respect to dollar returns, which would in fact be severely misguided.</p>\n<p>(If you'd like to hear my thoughts on FTX more generally as opposed to this technical question you can listen to <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/robs-thoughts-on-the-ftx-bankruptcy/id1245002988\">some comments</a> I put out on The 80,000 Hours Podcast feed.)</p>\n", "user": {"username": "Robert_Wiblin"}}, {"_id": "fNLmGFqW42nofP2nW", "title": "Donation Matching Opportunities", "postedAt": "2022-11-25T13:33:28.141Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Here are some neglected donation matching opportunities I've found:</p><p>1.

But a couple of people suggested it might be good to write a post like this. Also, over some of the past week I couldn\u2019t be around others (covid), and found that pretty isolating and alienating while the FTX crisis was intensifying. For people who feel less surrounded by like-minded people in daily life, I thought it might be helpful to have some more voices on the forum expressing how we\u2019re feeling.

As usual for my posts on the forum, I\u2019m writing in a personal capacity.&nbsp;</p><p>[Written 19/11/2022]</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>How I\u2019m feeling</h3><p>I was hesitant to write about my feelings not just because they seem irrelevant, but also because it feels hard even to know how I\u2019m feeling, let alone describe it. I also honestly really don\u2019t want to inhabit a bunch of my emotions right now. But I\u2019ll have a go at describing them here.&nbsp;</p><p>Please don\u2019t take any of these as in any way a prescription on how people should feel. Some of my friends feel angry and betrayed right now, some feel confused about their place in the world, some feel totally fine and largely unaffected by last week\u2019s events. All of those sound totally reasonable to me.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are a few of the kinds of things I\u2019ve been feeling over the last week, to give a flavour of how much it feels like I\u2019ve bounced around: Panic and urgency over figuring out how the things I\u2019m responsible for need to be handled and done differently in light of this. Frustration and anger at how powerless I feel to really help. Anguish that whatever I tried to work on I somehow seemed to upset someone or let someone down. Gratitude for being able to go home to my son and how excited toddlers are to see you even if you can\u2019t do anything more in the world than provide food and cuddles.&nbsp;</p><p>I\u2019ve been trying not to inhabit my feelings of sadness too much. There\u2019s a lot to do, now of all times, so being too upset to contribute seems worth avoiding if I can. I\u2019ve found two things particularly salient, and their sadness impossible to avoid. One is interpersonal conflict.&nbsp; It\u2019s an extremely high stress time in which people are even busier than usual, so it\u2019s easier than ever to cause friction, whether with friends/colleagues/online acquaintances. I\u2019m also finding that harder to deal with than usual, I think because my refuge is usually caring relationships. The other sadness I\u2019m finding impossible to avoid inhabiting is that some of my dearest friends are feeling deeply sad in a way I can do almost nothing to alleviate.&nbsp;</p><p>Those are the things that I can\u2019t get away from. But I know that in some light they don\u2019t even seem that significant. There are so many sadnesses now that I really want to avoid looking at. One is sadness for the people who lost their money, despite thinking it was safely deposited rather than even being invested. Like a lot of us, I know people who lost money to this, including most of their life savings. Another is sadness for people who had been planning important endeavours with grants they were expecting but now won\u2019t get, in some cases even giving up stable employment for it. Another is sadness for people who received a donation and now have to choose between paying the rent and feeling somehow culpable.&nbsp;</p><p>But the thing I really can\u2019t abide looking at is the loss to the people who were the intended ultimate beneficiaries of the money I thought FTX was going to be able to legitimately donate. The group of intended beneficiaries was a broad and diverse group, many of whom not only aren\u2019t identifiable but don\u2019t yet exist. It\u2019s the animals in factory farms which will endure worse conditions because of money not going to lobbying. It\u2019s people continuing to suffer from preventable health conditions. It\u2019s as yet unborn people whose future might be shorter or contain more suffering than it could have. Of course we don't know if the projects FTX might have funded would have worked -- but they stood a chance, a chance they'll now not get.</p><p>In my head, the benchmark for EA donations is bed nets. That\u2019s mostly because of what I\u2019ve worked on in the past, which is somewhat arbitrary. For better or worse though, my intuitive mental standard, which other donations need to improve on, is AMF. And I really believed that the FTX\u2019s donations would, in expectation, meet that standard. If there\u2019s some specific amount of money that FTX made legitimately that could ever have been donated, I don\u2019t know what it is. The sense of loss is in my mind, rather than a fact about the world. But knowing that doesn\u2019t prevent the feeling I can\u2019t bear - that the world just lost on the order of $10 billion of saving the lives of infants from malaria.&nbsp;</p><p>I haven\u2019t been talking or even thinking about this, because I haven\u2019t so far been able to without crying. And the more I\u2019m crying, the less I\u2019m helping. But for anyone who\u2019s struggling with the same, I wanted you to know you aren\u2019t alone.&nbsp;</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Dealing with grief</h3><p>For some of us, the reaction to this event is a lot like grief. You might be dealing with this grief, or you might be supporting others feeling grief. Hopefully, most of us don\u2019t experience grief that often. So it can be surprising, and confusing to handle, in addition to obviously being difficult. So I thought I\u2019d share a few thoughts about grieving.</p><p>My main experience with this comes from having a late term stillbirth. One thing that I hadn\u2019t anticipated then about grieving was how unpredictable my emotions would be - day to day, and hour to hour. I wasn\u2019t sure which things would upset me, and which would be fine. So I tried to take a fairly \u2018experimental\u2019 approach to things, eg trying out going to a social event to see how it would feel, rather than immediately committing to spending a whole evening.&nbsp;</p><p>The unpredictability of grieving is made harder by the fact that different people react very differently to similar upsetting situations. So it\u2019s hard to learn from what works for another person what will work for you. Having said that, here are a few things I found helpful when grieving, in case that\u2019s useful:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Starting out on CBT/meditation/therapy while I was still reeling.&nbsp;<ul><li>I treated things like trying therapy and starting on an online CBT app as a set of tasks to immediately do, rather than waiting to feel like wanting to do them. I basically didn\u2019t know how to feel better, but trying things out seemed good.

Thankfully, I have people around me who can help me not feel bad about it when I drop things or can't focus -- they reassure me that's normal, and understandable, and it doesn't mean I can't be helpful in general.

Only 5 years later did I encounter people who were seriously thinking about how best to help others. To be honest, I wasn\u2019t really sure it would stick. In the first wave of media attention GWWC got (around 2009), we got a lot of comments that we were just idealistic youngsters and we\u2019d think differently when we reached our thirties. That sounded pretty plausible to me - people\u2019s lives change a lot after they start settling down and having kids. But I\u2019m now married, with a house and a kid, and it turns out that hasn\u2019t changed my desire to make the world better.&nbsp;</p><p>This week was a huge setback. And that adds to the fact that it was already really hard to know how we can best help people, and really hard to actually do the things that seem best.

I\u2019m truly grateful to have people challenging me to live up to my values and helping me do so.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Michelle_Hutchinson"}}, {"_id": "TH4wN6sB8TFjdt87b", "title": "Sentience Institute 2022 End of Year Summary", "postedAt": "2022-11-25T12:28:14.970Z", "htmlBody": "<h1>Summary</h1><p><a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/\">Sentience Institute</a> is a 501(c)3 nonprofit think tank aiming to maximize positive impact through <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/longtermism\">longtermist</a> research on social and technological change, particularly <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/moral-circle-expansion-1\">moral circle expansion</a>. Our main focus in 2022 has been conducting high-quality empirical research, primarily surveys and behavioral experiments, to build the field of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/the-importance-of-artificial-sentience\"><u>digital minds</u></a> research (e.g., How will humans react to AI that seems agentic and intentional? How will we know when an AI is sentient?). Our two most notable publications this year are a report and open-access data for our 2021&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/aims-survey\"><u>Artificial Intelligence, Morality, and Sentience (AIMS) survey</u></a> and our paper in&nbsp;<i>Computers in Human Behavior</i> on \u201c<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/predicting-the-moral-consideration-of-artificial-intelligences\"><u>Predicting the Moral Consideration of Artificial Intelligences</u></a>,\u201d and we have substantial room for more funding to continue and expand this work in 2023 and beyond.</p><p>AIMS is the first nationally representative longitudinal survey of attitudes on these topics. Even today with limited AI capabilities, we are already seeing the social relationship we have with these digital minds bearing on public discourse, funding, and other events in the trajectory of AI. The CiHB predictors paper is a deep dive into demographic and psychological predictors of AI attitudes, so we can understand why certain people view these topics in the way that they do. This follows up on our 2021 conceptual paper in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328721000641\"><i><u>Futures</u></i></a> and literature review in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%252Fs11948-021-00331-8\"><i><u>Science and Engineering Ethics</u></i></a>. We have also been working to build this new field through hosting a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/podcast/\"><u>podcast</u></a>, an&nbsp;<a href=\"http://summitonai.org\"><u>AI summit at the University of Chicago</u></a>, and a regular intergroup call between organizations working on this topic (e.g., Center on Long-Term Risk, Future of Humanity Institute).&nbsp;</p><p>The urgency of building this field has been underscored in two ways in 2022. First, AIs are rapidly becoming more advanced, as illustrated in the amazing performance of image generation models \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s DALL-E 2, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion \u2014 as well as DeepMind\u2019s Gato as a general-purpose transformer and high-performing language models Chinchilla and Google\u2019s PaLM. Second, the topic of AI sentience had one of its first spikes in the mainstream news cycle, first as OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ilyasut/status/1491554478243258368\"><u>tweeted</u></a> \u201cit may be that today's large neural networks are slightly conscious\u201d in February, and then a much larger spike as Google Engineer Blake Lemoine was fired after&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2022/06/11/google-ai-lamda-blake-lemoine/\"><u>claiming</u></a> their language model LaMDA is \u201csentient.\u201d</p><p>In 2023, we hope to continue our empirical research as well as develop these findings into a digital minds \u201ccause profile,\u201d making the case for it as a highly neglected, tractable cause area in effective altruism with an extremely large scale. The perceptions, nature, and effects of digital minds are quickly becoming an important part of the trajectory of advanced AI systems and seem like they will continue to be so in medium- and long-term futures. This cause profile would be in part a more rigorous version of our blog post, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/the-importance-of-artificial-sentience\"><u>The Importance of Artificial Sentience</u></a>.\u201d</p><p>2022 has been a challenging year for effective altruism funding.

We hope to raise $90,000 this giving season for our work on digital minds, such as surveys, experimental research, the cause profile, and other field-building projects.</strong> We will also continue some work on factory farming thanks to generous donors most excited about moral circle expansion in that domain, such as our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/aft-survey\"><u>Animals, Food, and Technology (AFT) survey</u></a> and an experiment on how welfare reforms like cage-free eggs affect attitudes towards animal farming in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/animal-welfare-reforms-AFO\"><i><u>Anthrozo\u00f6s</u></i></a>.</p><p>As always, we are extremely grateful to our supporters who share our vision and make this work possible.

This is the first nationally representative longitudinal survey on this topic. For example, we find that 74.91% of U.S. residents agreed that sentient AIs deserve to be treated with respect and 48.25% of people agreed that sentient AIs deserve to be included in the moral circle. Also, people who showed more moral consideration of nonhuman animals and the environment tended to show more moral consideration of sentient AIs. There is much more detail that we hope will be useful for researchers, policymakers, and others in the years to come. And because this year\u2019s survey was the first data ever for many of these questions, we had&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/data-publication-AIMS-survey\"><u>SI researchers</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/?search=%222021%20AIMS%20survey%22\"><u>Metaculus users</u></a> forecast the results to know how our beliefs should update.

We find, for example, that substratism, sci-fi fan identity, techno-animism, and positive emotions were the strongest predictors, suggesting that these groups of people may be the strongest supporters of AI rights, and perhaps those most vulnerable to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ELIZA_effect\"><u>ELIZA effect</u></a>, in the years to come.</li><li>We published our first historical case study for our work on AI, \u201c<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/downloads/The%20History%20of%20AI%20Rights%20Research.pdf\"><u>The History of AI Rights Research</u></a>.\u201d This is a largely descriptive project because we did not know of any other place where the history of the field had been straightforwardly documented with this depth. We identify several streams of academic thought with, until the 2010s, surprisingly little cross-citation. We suggest four strategies that could help grow the field in beneficial ways.

A Summary of Selected Books</u></a>\u201d provides a go-to citation for the claim that there is a broad consensus among leading philosophers that AI sentience and consciousness is possible, even among scholars such as John Searle known as skeptics. In some cases, this is because those critiques see AI consciousness as technically possible but unlikely with current computing architectures. Most works also cover a \u201cwait and see\u201d approach in that we have deep uncertainty about consciousness or at least which systems have it.</li><li>The essay \u201c<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/the-future-might-not-be-so-great\"><u>The Future Might Not Be So Great</u></a>\u201d begins to develop a view of&nbsp;<i>cautious longtermism</i>: \u201cBefore humanity colonizes the universe, we must ensure that the future we would build is one worth living in.\u201d This is motivated by a careful cataloging of arguments on the value of the long-term future that suggests it is not highly positive, in contrast with the often unanalyzed assumption in conventional longtermism.

As in previous iterations, we found strong U.S. opposition to various aspects of animal farming, such as discomfort with the industry (74.6%) and support for a ban on slaughterhouses (49.1%). We also added a regional analysis showing that the West North Central region (the nation\u2019s \u201cAgricultural Heartland\u201d) is most supportive of animal farming and least supportive of animal product alternatives.</li><li>For our farmed animal research program, we published a paper \u201c<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/animal-welfare-reforms-AFO\"><u>The Effects of Exposure to Information About Animal Welfare Reforms on Animal Farming Opposition: A Randomized Experiment</u></a>\u201d in the peer-reviewed journal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/animal-welfare-reforms-AFO\"><i><u>Anthrozo\u00f6s</u></i></a>. This presents the results of a preregistered experiment on how welfare reforms like cage-free eggs affect attitudes towards animal farming. We found that participants (<i>n</i> = 1,520) provided with information about current animal farming practices had somewhat higher animal farming opposition (AFO) than participants provided with information about an unrelated topic (<i>d</i> = 0.17).

We expect these calls to occur twice a year with participation from the Sentience Institute, Future of Humanity Institute, Legal Priorities Project, Global Catastrophic Risk Institute, Center on Long-Term Risk, Center for Reducing Suffering, and Mila. These calls may take different forms as we learn what is most effective, such as research workshops where we also invite academics and independent researchers to share their digital minds research findings.</li><li>On October 13\u201315, 2022, we co-organized&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.summitonai.org/\"><u>The Summit on AI in Society</u></a>, which included leaders in AI research such as Erik Brynjolffson, Melanie Mitchell, Dewey Murdick, and Stuart Russell.

Research expenses are primarily researcher salaries; outreach this year was primarily the staff time spent on the podcast and intergroup call; and admin expenses include insurance, software, and our virtual office subscription.</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1671490941/mirroredImages/TH4wN6sB8TFjdt87b/s56hxwidf8gnbyzgjzae.png\"></p><p>We continue to maintain a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/transparency\"><u>Transparency</u></a> page with annual financial information, a running list of mistakes, and other public information.</p><h1>Room for More Funding</h1><p>We have substantial room for more funding for highly cost-effective projects. We are currently aiming to raise $90,000 this giving season (November 2022\u2013January 2023) to continue our work on digital minds research. We also welcome donations specifically to our continued work on factory farming and will do our best to ensure their counterfactual impact is only an increase in that research.</p><p>While we know that the economic downturn and FTX\u2019s collapse will make fundraising difficult this year, we would be thrilled to raise more than this. For each additional $75,000 after that, we could continue hiring at least 2\u20133 top-tier researchers, up to a total of $300,000. Our early 2022 recruitment had 108 applicants for the generalist position (1 we hired and at least 5 more we would have been thrilled to hire) and 98 researcher applicants (2 we hired and at least 5 more we would have been thrilled to hire). If we were able to raise more, we would put forth a more ambitious plan, which we are open to, for organizational scaling in 2023 and 2024.</p><p>If you have questions, feedback, or would like to collaborate, please email me at&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:michael@sentienceinstitute.org\"><u>michael@sentienceinstitute.org</u></a>.

Your expected donation size stays constant at $1,000.</li><li>If you win, it will be worth the time to think more carefully about where to allocate the money.

We provide mentoring and financial support to students from low-income countries who want to complete a Bachelor\u2019s degree in a high-income country. We aim to give millions of students the opportunity to pursue the education they want, and to lift themselves and their families out of poverty in the process. We believe that this is one of the most effective poverty reduction strategies in per-dollar terms that is available.</p><p>&nbsp;Malengo currently recruits low-income, high-ability students in Uganda, and supports them in applying for and completing a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Germany. By 2030, we aim to support students from most low-income and lower-middle income countries, and facilitate undergraduate studies in more than a dozen destination countries. Our program is sustainable by combining a strong network of volunteer mentors with a financial model in which students support future generations of scholars once they have a high enough income (income share agreements, ISAs).

As I will discuss later in the series, I think that cross-group involvement is beneficial and should be encouraged.</p><h1>Other work groups</h1><p>I am very uncertain here and would welcome thoughts/disagreement.</p><h2>Field-builders</h2><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/field-building\">Field-building refers to</a> influencing existing fields of research or advocacy or developing new ones, through advocacy, creating organisations, or funding people to work in the field. I regard field-building as a type of movement building with a focus on academic/research issues (e.g., increasing the number of supportive researchers, research institutes and research publications).&nbsp;</p><h2>Community builders</h2><p>I treat community building as a type of movement building focused on community growth (e.g., increasing the number of contributors and sense of connections within the AI Safety community).&nbsp;</p><h2>AI Funders</h2><p>I regard any AI safety-focused funding as a type of movement building (potentially at the overlap of another work group), focused on providing financial support.</p><h2>AI Ethics</h2><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/ethics-of-artificial-intelligence\">The ethics of artificial intelligence is the study of the ethical issues arising from the creation of artificial intelligence.</a> I regard safety-focused AI ethics as a subset of strategy, governance and technical work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Summary of my conceptualisation of the AI Safety community</h1><p>Based on the above, I conceptualise the AI Safety community as shown below.</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669349458/mirroredImages/5iQoR8mhEpvRT43jv/nopvtryfryea9bar5gab.png\" alt=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/p-8aaHT8m8spXoyHd6hSmHw6UoFnr062HgT5B3eVeIK8_cVUxiHkGSJw72WhI_5nZ3cPaAUKNmGeYss9F3R6JeXOyvSqfE05H3sOfr87uKXxxcms0cBhJVctZkWSzckRcqDQwSPy3AQMoqd_Xhm1tOczov0lMTJ-qTxHObeJMYAZ17BkcjQBsvULeJt4vA\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/022927cc4010382f3b7dbef71508821aec60050c36963c14.png/w_100 100w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/022927cc4010382f3b7dbef71508821aec60050c36963c14.png/w_200 200w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/022927cc4010382f3b7dbef71508821aec60050c36963c14.png/w_300 300w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/022927cc4010382f3b7dbef71508821aec60050c36963c14.png/w_400 400w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/022927cc4010382f3b7dbef71508821aec60050c36963c14.png/w_500 500w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/022927cc4010382f3b7dbef71508821aec60050c36963c14.png/w_600 600w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/022927cc4010382f3b7dbef71508821aec60050c36963c14.png/w_700 700w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/022927cc4010382f3b7dbef71508821aec60050c36963c14.png/w_800 800w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/022927cc4010382f3b7dbef71508821aec60050c36963c14.png/w_900 900w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/022927cc4010382f3b7dbef71508821aec60050c36963c14.png/w_940 940w\"></p><h1>Feedback</h1><p>Does this all seem useful, correct and/or optimal?

After doing so for a few years, we have come to further recognize both:</p><ol><li>Although research related bottlenecks are often significant, in a number of cases a different factor most limits impact. <strong>For some of the most promising opportunities, there simply don\u2019t exist adequate options to absorb aligned resources.</strong></li><li>RP has the organizational capacity, knowledge, and ability to secure funding to initiate promising projects in these areas.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>So, to continue driving progress in global priorities, RP has become increasingly interested in identifying new promising projects that could absorb a significant amount of resources, and in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/AFgvA9imsT6bww8E3/announcing-the-rethink-priorities-special-projects-program\"><u>incubating or otherwise supporting these initiatives</u></a>&nbsp;to launch and develop.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefexlxt7c28r8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnexlxt7c28r8\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to supporting these special projects, we have also expanded both our personnel\u2014particularly in recent times\u2014and our research agenda. Namely, within this past year, we\u2019ve expanded our work addressing global health and development, AI governance and strategy, and other longtermist issues. <strong>We\u2019ve also further differentiated our approach according to the context of each global priority in order to act on the specific outstanding impact opportunities in a given area.</strong>&nbsp;As we now work across a number of quite different areas, that differentiation in practice means we now perform a wide combination of both analysis and actions. Given this approach, and our relatively recent scaling in some areas, RP did much more consultancy-like research this year. Much of our commissioned work in 2022\u2014particularly in Global Health and Development and AI Governance and Strategy\u2014was not published. Furthermore, we think much of our longtermist work this year could be impactful via informing policy, and perhaps also through informing others\u2019 research and career decisions.</p><p>As a result of all the above, across the global priority areas that we work on, RP is a combination of all the following:</p><ul><li>A consultancy doing commissioned work in response to demands from EA-aligned organizations.</li><li>A research institute driven by research agendas we set according to our own priorities.</li><li>A think tank aiming to inform public policy to improve the world.</li><li>An accelerator, incubator, and base for new priority projects.</li></ul><p>To put it simply, our general theory of change is as follows:</p><p><img style=\"width:600.5px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673899070/mirroredImages/Liphmkodcu7XPDKfK/jgboegvj5vuni1otkzic.png\" alt=\"\"></p><h2>2022 Impact Summary</h2><p>In 2022, RP has achieved many milestones and accomplishments across the global priority areas in which we work.

Twelve of these projects were commissioned by, and submitted to&nbsp;Open Phil and the two remaining reports&nbsp;were produced in response to other major funders. We are aiming to publish at least five of the reports prepared for Open Phil on the EA Forum by the end of the year. The Global Health and Development team also expanded significantly in 2022, adding six staff (three research assistants, two managers, and one researcher.)</p><h3><a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/longtermism\"><u>Longtermism</u></a></h3><p>The Longtermism department gradually grew from a headcount of three at the start of 2022 to a total of 19 (including research assistants, as well as temporary fellows, and temporary contractors) at the time of writing. This growth was intended not only to expand our capacity to create and share impactful research products/insights but also to improve the expected future impact of the people hired (e.g. helping fellows gain knowledge, skills, and connections that increase their ability to secure and excel in future roles).

That means, across the organization this year, influencing Open Phil was the most frequently pursued impact channel. We think that the current percentage of consultancy-type projects at RP is acceptable.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefx39annbq4w\"><sup><a href=\"#fnx39annbq4w\">[18]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;But, as we further develop within certain areas (e.g. global health and development), pending sufficient interest, we will likely want to continue that consultancy work while also venturing further into other impact channels, such as through progressing&nbsp;an independent research agenda.&nbsp;We would also like to identify more key stakeholders that we can work closely with, and further build our relationships with them.</p><p><strong>In some areas we are more established than in others.</strong>&nbsp;Particularly, our Animal Welfare department seems to have greater volume and variety of outputs.

We\u2019re very interested in ascertaining how those in a position to implement are acting on our work, if at all, and we\u2019re committed to tracking our impact in multiple ways. <strong>We are particularly interested in conducting more ex ante and ex post analyses to estimate our impact, and the return on investment of our work, and then taking the time to externally communicate these.</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefuyg8o26kv8r\"><sup><a href=\"#fnuyg8o26kv8r\">[28]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This analysis could include surveys and/or interviews of stakeholders<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefimc5qzsm7rs\"><sup><a href=\"#fnimc5qzsm7rs\">[29]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;as well as case studies.

We also created further documentation related to our governance (and will be looking to expand our board over the next year) and established a committee focused on justice, equity, inclusion, and diversity within the organization. We have also done more work in formalizing our strategy internally this year, and we\u2019ll turn to that now. &nbsp;</p><h1>2023 Strategy&nbsp; &nbsp;</h1><h2>Our Rationale for Working on Various Cause Areas</h2><p>Our work now addresses animal welfare, artificial intelligence, climate change, global health and development, investigations of worldviews, longtermism, and EA movement research. <strong>Next year, we will continue to work on all of these&nbsp;global priorities (to varying extents) because our leadership, on aggregate, believes:</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflxgpv49m9f9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlxgpv49m9f9\">[31]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>There is significant uncertainty about which priority area is most impactful.</li><li>There may be diminishing returns to RP focusing on any one priority area.</li><li>A large amount of resources are not fungible across these different areas.</li><li>Non-fungibility, diminishing returns, and significant uncertainty means it can actually be easier for us to do great research in multiple cause areas than figure out which cause area we ought to specialize in.</li><li>Work on any single area can gain from our working on multiple areas:<ul><li>Teams have much greater access to centralized resources, staff, funding, and productive oversight than what they would receive if the team existed independently and solely focused on that priority.</li><li>Teams can somewhat more easily access the support of other researchers, who have a background in other disciplines, so they have the option to learn from work in other areas.</li></ul></li><li>Working across different priorities allows the organization to build capacity, reputation, and relations, and maintain option value for the future.</li><li>Relationships within an area can be useful for work in another area.</li><li>There is a lot of value in advancing the project of effective altruism, and the areas we operate in are areas that the community prioritizes.</li><li>In combination, the above suggests that we can have the most impact (in expectation) by working across all these global priority areas.</li></ul><h2>Our North Stars&nbsp;</h2><p>Across all the global priority areas that we are active in, we also have the following overarching \u201cnorth stars\u201d that outline fundamental dimensions of our currently intended direction:<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwy4y7sbktx\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwy4y7sbktx\">[32]</a></sup></span></p><ul><li><strong>Produce and/or&nbsp;disseminate key insights to increase the effectiveness of others\u2019 efforts on global priorities: </strong>Billions of dollars and millions of person-hours are currently spent addressing global priorities, and even more will be spent in the future. Producing and/or disseminating key insights can dramatically improve their allocations and efforts. Therefore, we\u2019ll attempt to uncover required key insights by having top researchers work on crucial questions. We\u2019ll also try to garner connections with relevant decision-makers in order to deliver insights and augment their efforts on global priorities.</li><li><strong>Otherwise drive progress on promising yet neglected ways to address global priorities, for instance via accelerating priority projects: </strong>We want to be able to impactfully drive progress on global priorities, even when influencing others doesn\u2019t seem like the most promising pathway to do so. Examples of this could include times when instead of influencing others we need to complete some specific fundamental research, help trial some new intervention, or found an organization. Global priorities are usually quite neglected. Within them, there can be numerous promising avenues or projects that are entirely neglected. Given adequate resources, and research and operations capacity, for a number of them, we may be well or even best positioned to be an early mover. We think our analysis can determine when this is the case, and when we should attempt to accelerate some neglected projects in order to help address a global priority.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Maintain and strengthen our reputation and relations:</strong>&nbsp;We want to build a really good foundation for future additional work addressing the two previously mentioned broad longer-term directions. This \u201cnorth star\u201d is rooted in our belief that the amount of valuable work that could be completed is quite large. It follows that limiting factors to scaling are rather important. In fact, longer-term, our reputation and relations seem like some key determinants of the quantity and type of work we can do.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Sustainably yet significantly scale to further increase our impact: </strong>Again, the amount of valuable work that could be completed is quite large. Provided we perform well, in the future, we should be in a position to even further scale. We want to correctly capitalize on that, and scale soundly (i.e. in such a way that maintains operational efficiency), but still significantly.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Some Key Medium-Term Considerations</h2><p>There are four related key considerations we have identified over the medium term for our organization:</p><ul><li><strong>Continue to focus on enhancing and maintaining strong relations and reputation with key stakeholders:</strong>&nbsp;As our relationships and reputation will be the foundation for a lot of possibilities in the future, we want them to be increasingly strong. To do so, we need to maintain professionalism in what we deliver, set high-quality standards for our work, and have an increasing number of research outputs.</li><li><strong>More actively address bottlenecks on further growth: </strong>We want to ensure that we have adequate management capacity, clear strategic direction, solid internal systems, the requisite organizational resources and policies, and just overall planning, to grow in the right way. We are going to be more proactive in these general areas.</li><li><strong>Appropriately capitalize on further growth opportunities:</strong>&nbsp;The ceiling for our impact and scale is still really large, as only a small fraction of potentially high-impact research questions have actually been investigated, and an even smaller subset acted upon. There are various inputs that could cause us to grow, such as:<ul><li>A high-net-wealth individual who is new to EA, and wishes to support work RP would like to see done.</li><li>Large increases in support from extant relationships.</li><li>Increasing the number of funders yielding a net 'large' increase in support.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Strive not to be overly reliant on just a few or one funder, for impact or funding purposes.</strong>&nbsp;We are currently often quite reliant on relatively few donors (or a single one for some projects). If a funder rescinded their support, it would require us to rapidly find more funding. Also, if the funder did not make any changes to their thinking or decisions in light of our research, that may severely hamper our impact. To mitigate the financial risk to our programs, plus some risk to our impact by focusing heavily on one funder, we would like to somewhat further engage other philanthropists/foundations and organizations, and explore some new funding models (e.g. some types of fiscal sponsorship for priority projects).&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Our Values</h2><p>The values RP will attempt to epitomize are:</p><ul><li><strong>Striving for impact:</strong>&nbsp;We are determined to improve the world across humans and nonhumans, both in the present and future as much as we can.</li><li><strong>Seeking the truth:</strong>&nbsp;We believe that all ideas are subject to scrutiny and strive to deepen our understanding of the world by investigating complex problems and posing difficult questions (even if it makes us uncomfortable). We apply the concept of intellectual honesty in our work.</li><li><strong>Creating an empowering environment:</strong>&nbsp;We think our staff are brilliant and we are committed to helping them flourish and succeed. We strive to create a welcoming, trusting, safe, fair, and supportive culture that promotes collaboration, honest conversations, and respectful exchanges of ideas.</li><li><strong>Aiming for excellence:</strong>&nbsp;We aim for nothing less than the best quality of research and highest standards of operational excellence. We are rigorous, ambitious, and transparent about our strengths and limitations.</li><li><strong>Nurturing a culture of innovation:</strong>&nbsp;We cultivate a learning mindset and encourage creative, independent thinking.</li></ul><p>Hopefully that all gives a reasonably good sense of our core strategy for the coming year! However, as mentioned previously, we often try to differentiate our strategic approach across areas in order to best match specific impact opportunities within them. Given that, we\u2019ll briefly expand on area-specific strategies now.</p><h2>Area-Specific Strategies</h2><p><strong>Animal Welfare:</strong></p><ul><li>We will continue to directly support grantmakers and organizations in the farmed animals space by providing decision-relevant analyses of current interventions, working to identify new promising interventions, and providing missing theoretical inputs for their work.</li><li>Outside of that, we will continue to focus on neglected but highly promising areas in both the invertebrate and wild animal welfare space.</li><li>We will further reflect upon and then potentially pursue some higher-leverage impact opportunities (e.g. perhaps more directly tackling some movement-level strategic uncertainties, and partnering with others for some further coordination efforts).</li></ul><p><strong>Global Health and Development:</strong></p><ul><li>We will continue to significantly consult with Open Phil.</li><li>We will explore opportunities to conduct actionable research for other organizations, and work with other large funders in the space.</li><li>We will do some more scoping of non-consulting work and likely tackle topics we think are high-value that other EA-aligned players in the space haven\u2019t looked at, or may take a different approach to important areas that have already been examined.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5xovtvqhzp5\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5xovtvqhzp5\">[33]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Longtermism:</strong></p><ul><li>One main focus will continue to be on fully establishing a strong team of permanent researchers and rotating fellows tackling AI governance projects, with its priorities guided by a mix of Open Phil, other key stakeholders, and our own sense of what\u2019s most important.</li><li>Simultaneously, we will continue to work out possible additional research directions for the non-AI portion of our Longtermism department.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftc5lxmw29h\"><sup><a href=\"#fntc5lxmw29h\">[34]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</li><li>We will continue to work with the Special Projects department to help incubate promising longtermist projects.</li><li>We will also continue to try to improve longtermism-relevant talent pipelines, including via providing roles for people relatively new to the space and actively helping our staff gain knowledge, skills, and connections.</li></ul><p><strong>Surveys and EA Movement Research:</strong></p><ul><li>We will use surveys, message testing, and focus groups to explore how to best talk about longtermism and effective altruism with the general public and interested policymakers. We\u2019d like to do more of our own independent work in this area in addition to the consulting work we currently do directly for existing orgs.</li><li>We will analyze the latest iteration of the EA Survey, which is running now, and continue other significant efforts to understand the current status of the movement.</li><li>We will continue to have capacity\u2014especially after Q1 2023\u2014to do more bespoke survey work on behalf of the EA community and EA-adjacent organizations.</li></ul><p><strong>Worldview Investigations:</strong></p><ul><li>We aim to launch a new Worldview Investigations team. It will focus on examining crucial questions that may have a huge bearing on how philanthropic resources will be allocated across humans and non-human animals, present and future generations.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0bhjindyx5yi\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0bhjindyx5yi\">[35]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</li><li>For now, this work will mainly aim to improve the allocation of EA resources across and within cause areas, perhaps by completing foundational work that a major funder specifically commissions; but secondly, by also helping lay the foundation for future research into Worldview Investigations.</li><li>We will seek further collaborators and/or hires here, and start tackling some research questions in a promising way.</li></ul><h1>Funding Gaps Through Year-End 2022 and 2023</h1><p><strong>RP\u2019s most urgent funding need is for further unrestricted donations,</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbvs67g4onss\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbvs67g4onss\">[36]</a></sup></span><strong>&nbsp;which help ensure we have the greatest ability to direct funds to where they can be most effective and that we can react quickly to new opportunities that arise.</strong>&nbsp;We have sometimes had the greatest impact when we had this flexibility to readily explore new options that weren\u2019t easy to find funders for at the time,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7pe3jnyghp7\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7pe3jnyghp7\">[37]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and feel most comfortable in pursuing those opportunities when we have significant funding that is not restricted to specific projects. Flexible funds also allow us to incubate new ideas to the point of proof of concept prior to attempting to justify them to funders, as well as explore ideas that don\u2019t end up working out. We will allocate resources across (and within) global priorities based on stakeholder demand and preferences, RP leadership\u2019s beliefs, our internal growth capacity, as well as the landscape of the respective areas.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqa9qykcjjh\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqa9qykcjjh\">[38]</a></sup></span></p><p><strong>However, given that we\u2019re often asked about our current funding needs in each of the areas in which we work, we have included estimates in the below table.</strong>&nbsp;Please note <strong>these are rough and approximate point estimates</strong>&nbsp;which use a number of simplifying assumptions to estimate <strong>current funding gaps under three different growth scenarios: i) No-Growth, ii) Moderate-Growth, and iii) High-Growth.</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9bynnb6xm2\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9bynnb6xm2\">[39]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;We report results for both funding gaps through both year-end 2022, and year-end 2023. To be clear, the revenue goals across the organization for these growth scenarios encompass maintaining 18 months of runway within each area at the end of those respective years. These models also don\u2019t include funding towards, or hires for any special project or incubated project. The main revenue model for our special projects is for those initiatives to fundraise independently and for RP\u2019s Special Projects team\u2019s costs to be covered as line items within the budgets of the special projects themselves.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2qgep6yic6y\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2qgep6yic6y\">[40]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Further information regarding the growth scenario conditions (with the exception of Worldview Investigations<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefn0n61hh4p1n\"><sup><a href=\"#fnn0n61hh4p1n\">[41]</a></sup></span>) and our confidence in meeting them follows:</p><ul><li><strong>No-Growth Scenario</strong><ul><li>In each cause area, we&nbsp;continue to have the same number of staff<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhhm5vxcykbt\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhhm5vxcykbt\">[42]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;as currently budgeted,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffiqbnh3v23\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfiqbnh3v23\">[43]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and can hence tackle a similar quantity/size of projects as in 2022.</li><li>This scenario would maintain RP at its current size and avoid any cutbacks.</li><li>We have very high confidence that we could effectively deploy funding at this level in order to maintain our organization and achieve significant impact moving forward.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>Moderate-Growth</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Scenario</strong><ul><li>We grow ~25% over 2023, meaning we hire another 10-20 full-time equivalents over the course of 2023, split proportional in size across the different areas in which we work. This scenario will enable us to deploy greater research capacity by hiring about a dozen additional researchers to address some of the most important questions we\u2019ve identified.</li><li>We are highly confident that we could effectively deploy funding at this level to build up our organization for sustainable impact moving forward. &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><strong>High-Growth Scenario</strong><ul><li>We<strong>&nbsp;</strong>shoot for<strong>&nbsp;</strong>a total of 125% uniform growth over the next two years. This growth plan would entail hiring 30-40 staff in each of the next two years. This ambitious scenario would enable RP to scale approaching the maximum rate we think is possible. Doing so would involve hiring around 10 additional operations staff in 2023 to prepare for a much larger research team, then several dozen more researchers over the remainder of 2024.</li><li>We are less confident about our ability to execute the high growth plan, but it does feel moderately plausible. We think this number represents a good view for the maximum amount of money that we could possibly put to productive use, such that any money raised beyond this amount would very likely be deferred to cover spending in 2024 or later.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Given the assumptions used to reach our funding gap estimates, we do want to be clear that these estimates are imperfect. We still list them here because we think they represent useful albeit rough approximations of the amount of funding that we are very highly confident, highly confident, and moderately confident we could absorb over the next year, and that they correspond to reasonable bounds on our core revenue goals until the end of this year and next.</p><ul><li><strong>Funding gaps&nbsp;for the different growth scenarios through year-end 2022</strong></li></ul><p>(Recall that this is a rough estimate and is based on aiming to have 18 months of reserves at the end of 2022.)</p><figure class=\"table\"

It would most likely mean, that for a few weeks to a few months we conduct work that, according to the worldview it is addressing, isn\u2019t very promising, before realizing the error, and then discontinuing that work. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Struggling with finding adequate numbers of highly-skilled individuals (3) only has a somewhat significant chance within the high-growth scenario.

From prior work, Peter and Marcus knew that having a clear impact through EA-related research was possible. They launched RP in 2018 with $12,500 of self-funding and as a six-month experiment. Initially, RP was fiscally sponsored by Rethink Charity.</p><p>In 2019, the RP team significantly expanded. At the time, they mainly focused on animal welfare&nbsp;because it was an area in which high-quality research seemed neglected, there was low-hanging fruit, and many organizations on-the-ground were bottlenecked on strategic insight into what interventions and programs work best. That year was defined by our newly expanded team conducting some high-quality work that impressed others. Based on this reputation, we were able to attract significant funding from Open Phil, EA Funds, and several other donors.</p><p>In 2020, Rethink Priorities amassed significant funding and started spending ~$750,000 a year, with a staff of 16, and also spun out of Rethink Charity as an independent organization. In 2021, we had 28 staff and a $2.1M budget. Upon the request of key stakeholders in the EA community, in 2021 we started to &nbsp;launch teams to address AI governance and strategy as well as global health and development, and more significantly expanded our operations team.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnexlxt7c28r8\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefexlxt7c28r8\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;To be clear, this year RP started a new <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/AFgvA9imsT6bww8E3/announcing-the-rethink-priorities-special-projects-program\"><u>Special Projects team</u></a>&nbsp;(housed within the Operations Department) to support initiatives, which will include incubating projects.&nbsp;Given our strong operations, RP envisions acting as a full-service fiscal sponsor for select promising EA groups.

However, we presently have to turn down some large commissions due to lack of staff capacity, and lack of adequate restricted funds in place to expand our team&nbsp;(or even to maintain the team at its current size). We turn down some large commissions because the vast majority of projects requested of us are highly time sensitive (i.e. organizations want them completed within a very fast timeline), so we need to have the staff already in place if we\u2019re to take them on, as it\u2019s not possible to hire staff in time to complete them even if they are offering more than enough funding to make it happen.

SBF clearly exposed EA to this risk for years, and people should have noticed this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Recently, I've been hearing a lot of people talking about the warning signs that could have prepared people for SBF and the FTX crisis. Intuitively, this seemed futile, since billionaires have to behave randomly; if they're predictable, then that leaves them vulnerable to being outmaneuvered and harvested by another billionaire, some of whom have a stronger appetite for predatory games than other billionaires.</p><p>However, SBF and FTX were an exception. It's been very strange to see tunnel vision on the tiniest bits and pieces of SBF's actions when there was this elephant in the room:</p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BH5-rSxilxo\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/BH5-rSxilxo\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><p>It's only two and a half minutes, and I highly recommend it. This slimy commercial, aired at the super bowl more than 8 months before the FTX crisis, was by far one of the biggest warning signs that something was off about SBF, and the people who noticed this should have <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TaBJqDMJtEH68Hhfw/ea-should-blurt\">felt emboldened to speak up and tell a lot of people when they notice something doesn't line up</a>.</p><p>In this commercial, FTX depicts cryptocurrencies (including NFTs, which as late as Feb 2022 were pretty widely known to be bad deals) as on the same level as several other foundational innovations in the human race, such as the wheel, and the portable music device (the progenitor of the modern smartphone). The commercial depicts forward-thinking people and cryptocurrencies as an unstoppable force for progress, and caricatures all critics and dissidents as clownlike enemies of progress who are inevitably ignored, defeated, and marginalized, so that innovation can take place and justice can be restored.</p><p>It is definitely the case that many institutions have an internal culture that is stifling to progress. People with experience in Silicon Valley, however, know that isn't the entire story.</p><p>About a week ago, Zvi wrote a fantastic article on the FTX crisis, and it slipped in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/p4XpZWcQksSiCPG72/sadly-ftx#The_Future_of_Effective_Altruist_Ethics\">a section evaluating the entire industry</a>. Included there:</p><blockquote><p>I mean, it <i>would </i>take out a big chunk of EA <i>because it would bring down all of crypto quite a lot. </i>The failure of Tether would be a catastrophic event for crypto. \u2018I do not hold any USDT\u2019 is <i>not </i>a way to stay safe out there.</p></blockquote><p>People familiar with economics can tell, at a glance, that it's worth checking to see if industry suffers heavily from <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asymmetricinformation.asp\">Information Asymmetry</a>: that one party to the transaction (in this case the sellers and the coin miners that they subsidize) has such superior knowledge of the product relative to the second party to the transaction that they routinely exploit the lesser party, such as lemons being much more profitable to sell at the used car market price than well-working used cars. Considering that coins can rapidly and unpredictably become worth a very small fraction of their original price, it definitely seems like that would be an even bigger issue here.</p><p>Even worse, Information Asymmetry is widely covered in intermediate microeconomics classes and is well-understood by everyone in business and most people in or adjacent to sales. All of this seems like a very worrying way for an industry to be structured, it would be precisely the same thing that drove the flow of toxic assets during the worst days of the mortgage-backed securities crisis around 15 years ago (the housing bubble). This is not because people are mimicking 2008 of course, but rather that it's generally the way that things fundamentally tend to unfold when there are large numbers of unscrupulous people who are trying to pump things as high as possible because they think they can time the market and make a ton of money.</p><p>I've seen a lot of people joking that SBF tried to triple his wealth, or become a trillionaire, or tried to \"double-or-nothing the earth\", and that the risk might have been worth it somehow. That doesn't really fit the evidence that we've been seeing from FTX for more than a year now has indicated that they are trying to spread awareness of cryptocurrencies, or, in other words, to turn very large numbers of people (e.g. the types who pay attention to sports or buy lottery tickets) to become amateur investors who buy and sell tokens of dubious value, in the same markets as professional investors who operate at a scale that lets them strategically time markets and hire sales teams to make transactions look more valuable then they actually are.</p><p>The fact is that SBF routinely threw his weight behind the concept of technological innovation, which is central to EA, and used it to spend massive sums of money promoting cryptocurrencies, to involve tens of millions of additional people into a high-tech industry with an inevitable net loss for the vast majority of participants, since the vast majority of participants were totally unprepared and incapable of fending for themselves in the murky world of cryptocurrency. The scale that tens of millions of people were operating at were \"I heard about FTX from a commercial, I heard about FTX from the stadium getting renamed, so I think I'll try it out\" and that's a scale that's too small to let a single individual get the information they need for a seat at the table. When billions of dollars move like that, it's one of the <a href=\"https://time.com/5707876/1929-wall-street-crash/\">oldest indicators </a>that an industry is not getting its investment inflows from investors who can actually forecast future profitability. The fact that cyptocurrencies have historically tended to quintuple in value, multiple times per decade, is by far the most attractive element in the minds of the masses; if it merely outperformed stock by 1.5x or 2x then that would not be nearly enough to compensate for the vagueness and doubt that any ordinary person would have.</p><p>A big takeaway from this super bowl commercial is that willingness of SBF and FTX to optimize for crypto at all costs, including knowingly and deliberately exposing EA to the risk of reputation loss, months in advance. Dustin Moscovitz doesn't do this, his investment porfolio has around as much crypto as anyone else on Wall Street nowadays. Peter Thiel's <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2022/04/peter-thiel-warren-buffett-crypto\">criticism of Warren Buffet in April</a> was probably just some dispute between him and Warren Buffet, and he's not currently affiliated with EA anyway. Even Eliezer Yudkowsky (not a billionaire) refuses to talk about cryptocurrency, no matter how many people<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/gvA4j8pGYG4xtaTkw/i-m-from-a-parallel-earth-with-much-higher-coordination-ama#:~:text=Steve%20Jackson%3A,They%20use%20money.\"> pester him about it.</a> They weren't willing to throw their weight behind the dream that cryptocurrencies will replace normal currencies and commodities and multiply the early-adopters balances by 100x, and they certainly weren't willing to wager EA on that dream.</p><p>SBF was not like that. There were clear warning signs that he was risking EA for the future of cryptocurrencies, not risking cryptocurrencies for the future of EA.</p>", "user": {"username": "trevorw96"}}, {"_id": "MQbCXfhPFdNmnspYK", "title": "Geometric Exploration, Arithmetic Exploitation", "postedAt": "2022-11-24T15:36:30.352Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "Scott Garrabrant"}}, {"_id": "SnS4kjt7ijPvXdhQA", "title": "Evolution, Pain, Suffering, and Ed Yong", "postedAt": "2022-11-24T13:36:03.165Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>tl;dr:</strong> Being able to sense things that are harmful \u2013 <i>nociception </i>\u2013 developed early in animal evolution.

I know a vegan who heard of a robot \"<a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/5593026103512648416/7046227952817759920#\">escaping</a>\" and felt a twinge of moral sympathy for the robot.&nbsp;<br><br>Indeed, many vegans spend more time trying to \"prove\" that bees are being exploited by the honey industry than they do actually trying to effectively decrease factory farming.

Sorry to be blunt, but both vegans and EAs have image problems. It isn't enough to be \"right.\" What matters is being effective, and that involves concern for appearances.</p><h3>Ed Yong on Insects</h3><p>In addition to <a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/5593026103512648416/7046227952817759920#\">the Open Phil report</a>, check out these excerpts from Ed Yong's wonderful <a href=\"https://www.blogger.com/blog/post/edit/5593026103512648416/7046227952817759920#\"><i>An Immense World</i></a><i>:</i></p><blockquote><p>We rarely distinguish between the raw act of sensing and the subjective experiences that ensue. But that\u2019s not because such distinctions don\u2019t exist.<br><br>Think about the evolutionary benefits and costs of pain [subjective suffering]. Evolution has pushed the nervous systems of insects toward minimalism and efficiency, cramming as much processing power as possible into small heads and bodies. Any extra mental ability \u2013 say, consciousness \u2013 requires more neurons, which would sap their already tight energy budget. They should pay that cost only if they reaped an important benefit. And what would they gain from pain?<br><br>The evolutionary benefit of nociception [sensing negative stimuli / bodily damage] is abundantly clear. It\u2019s an alarm system that allows animals to detect things that might harm or kill them, and take steps to protect themselves. But the origin of pain, on top of that, is less obvious. What is the adaptive value of suffering? Why should nociception suck? Animals can learn to avoid dangers perfectly well without needing subjective experiences. After all, look at what robots can do.<br><br>Engineers have designed robots that can behave as if they're in pain, learn from negative experiences, or avoid artificial discomfort. These behaviors, when performed by animals, have an interpreted as indicators of pain. But robots can perform them without subjective experiences.<br><br>Insect nervous systems have evolved to pull off complex behaviors in the simplest possible ways, and robots show us how simple it is possible to be. If we can program them to accomplish all the adaptive actions that pain supposedly enables without also programming them with consciousness, then evolution \u2013 a far superior innovator that works over a much longer time frame&nbsp;\u2013 would surely have pushed minimalist insect brains in the same direction. For that reason, Adamo thinks it's unlikely that insects (or crustaceans) feel pain. ...<br><br>Insects often do alarming things that seem like they should be excruciating. Rather than limping, they'll carry on putting pressure on a crushed limb. Male praying mantises will continue mating with females that are devouring them. Caterpillars will continue munching on a leaf while parasitic wasp larvae eat them from the inside out.

For those who don\u2019t know, <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/\">Effective Altruism</a> (or EA) is a research project and community that uses evidence and reason to do the most good. Tangibly, it\u2019s a burgeoning intellectual movement with close to 10,000 engaged folks globally, across <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/community#local\">70 countries</a> (although mostly in the EU and US). People in the effective altruism community <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism#fn-1\">focus primarily</a> on alleviating global poverty and diseases, reducing the suffering of animals used for food, and preventing existential risks from worst-case pandemics or misaligned artificial intelligence.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Due to the close association between Sam Bankman-Fried and Effective Altruism, EA has gotten a fair bit of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/16/is-the-effective-altruism-movement-in-trouble?CMP=Share_AndroidApp_Other\">criticism</a> <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/13/business/ftx-effective-altruism.html\">recently</a> about potentially not being the ideal do-gooder project it set out to be. But I think some of these <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/168991/ftx-effective-altruism-bankman-fried-climate\">critiques</a> miss the mark. Often, they criticise issues that don't actually exist in the community, but sound good. They also seem to glance over evidence that disputes their claims, such as the huge amount of effort that Effective Altruists have put towards improving the lives of some of the most poor people globally. For example, via <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a>, an EA-aligned charity evaluator, over 110,000 donors have moved over <strong>$1 billion </strong>to charities helping people in extreme poverty, by providing <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/amf\">malaria bed nets</a>, <a href=\"https://www.givedirectly.org/\">direct cash transfers</a>, or <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">more</a>. This is amazing. GiveWell thinks these actions will have saved over <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/about\">150,000 lives</a>, as well as providing $175 million in direct cash to the global poor.

If organisations decide to pursue projects outside the scope of donor interests, then funders can easily pull their giving.&nbsp;</li><li>EA donors give money to projects they find the most interesting, rather than what actually does the most good. This is partly down to donors defining effectiveness in their own terms, and funding projects that meet their criteria.</li><li>Effective Altruism doesn\u2019t tackle root issues, such as systems of oppression.

Beyond these points above, I, and most people within the EA community, also agree there\u2019s a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/n3WwTz4dbktYwNQ2j/critiques-of-ea-that-i-want-to-read\">long list</a> of ways EA could be improved. I mean, there was a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/YgbpxJmEdFhFGpqci/winners-of-the-ea-criticism-and-red-teaming-contest\">whole competition</a> to crowd-source the best critiques of EA, and the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/criticism-of-effective-altruism\">tag on the EA Forum</a> discussing EA critiques is fairly well-populated!</p><p>Despite this, I feel compelled to defend EA from at least some of these critiques, as I often think they make assumptions about the community that aren\u2019t true. I wouldn\u2019t say I\u2019m your stereotypical effective altruist either, if such a thing existed. If anything, I was on the side of the critics above, working on \u201csystem change\u201d and trying to change dominant institutions, such as our government, in radical ways. I\u2019ve been involved in grassroots animal rights and climate movements for around four years, such as Extinction Rebellion &amp; Animal Rebellion, and have been arrested a number of times for fairly <a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-54038591\">radical direct action</a>. It was also my full-time job for two years doing grassroots movement building at Animal Rebellion &amp; Extinction Rebellion. Most of my friends are hardcore anti-capitalists (I definitely have some anarchist leanings too) and <a href=\"https://www.socialchangelab.org/\">my current work</a> is all about understanding how mass social movements can be used as a tool for good. Necessary disclaimer: I have received EA funds for this, but if anything, that shows that EAs are open to funding more \u201csystem change\u201d approaches! But we\u2019ll get back to this another time.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F988e984c-47b9-4dd7-9ca8-0c2a4df2d6d2_1129x763.jpeg\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669296625/mirroredImages/pj2LqeJxefRFCFEhm/jzsva5vrkc6gs2tty7st.jpg\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F988e984c-47b9-4dd7-9ca8-0c2a4df2d6d2_1129x763.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F988e984c-47b9-4dd7-9ca8-0c2a4df2d6d2_1129x763.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F988e984c-47b9-4dd7-9ca8-0c2a4df2d6d2_1129x763.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F988e984c-47b9-4dd7-9ca8-0c2a4df2d6d2_1129x763.jpeg 1456w\"></a></p><p>So what about these critiques feel off to me? First of all, it\u2019s statements like this:</p><blockquote><p><i>Effective altruism organizations donate hills of cash to research that excites their donors, rather than focus on proven, efficient solutions to imminent needs.</i></p></blockquote><p>What don\u2019t I like about this critique that EA donors just give to their pet projects? To start with, it\u2019s just plainly not true. Effective Altruism is <strong>all</strong> about doing things that lead to the most good and putting consequences above your initial gut reaction. I think the author would struggle to find any serious amount of EA money that was given to a project due to a donor\u2019s arbitrary or emotional preference.

The following quote from the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/13/business/ftx-effective-altruism.html\">New York Times</a> sums it up nicely:</p><blockquote><p><i>They gain legitimation from their status as philanthropists, and there\u2019s a huge amount of incentive to allow them to call the shots and gain prominence as long as the money is flowing.</i></p></blockquote><p>Worse yet, some <a href=\"https://www.christophersebastian.info/post/vegans-race-the-cult-of-effective-altruism\">criticisms</a> go as far as to say:</p><blockquote><p><i>EA provides actors like Bankman-Fried cover by using philanthropy to launder their reputations, while leaving 'reason and evidence' at the door</i></p></blockquote><p>I find this line of reasoning a bit odd, and have two questions for these critics:</p><p>Would you rather these rare philanthropically-minded wealthy folks hoard their wealth, or spend it on personal luxuries like the other <a href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/mapped-the-worlds-billionaire-population-by-country/\">3,000 odd billionaires</a> in the world?</p><p>Do people really think that giving away over 90% of your wealth is the best thing to do for your wellbeing (via improving your reputation)?&nbsp;</p><p>For both of the questions, the answer seems to be an obvious no. I doubt that giving away all of your money is actually the optimal way for these people to lead a good life.

Rather than just complaining about the injustices of the world, EA offers a practical avenue to redistribute resources in a more equal way. <strong>Rather than spending it on frivolous luxuries, EA asks wealthy folks to give it to poor people, suffering animals and risks that could end humanity - how could anyone think that was a bad thing?</strong></p><p>(To be clear, I\u2019m talking mainly about Dustin and other wealthy EA donors here, rather than Sam Bankman-Fried, whose intentions do <a href=\"https://t.co/i93YTKvUZR\">seem</a> <strong>extremely</strong> worrying.

It\u2019s very easy to point out mistakes, but building a better alternative - that\u2019s hard work. We don\u2019t need more arm-chair critics who write opinion pieces about why EA is lacking in X or Y ways.

I have friends who:</p><ul><li><strong>Started a </strong><a href=\"https://leadelimination.org/\"><strong>charity </strong></a><strong>focused on eliminating lead in paint, </strong>to help kids in often Global South countries who <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/prevention/health-effects.htm\">suffer from</a> lifelong damage to their brain and nervous systems. They got the government of Malawi, along with paint manufacturers, to remove lead within paint. They estimate that <a href=\"https://leadelimination.org/malawi_cost-effectiveness_intro/\"><strong>215,000 fewer children</strong></a><strong> will be exposed to lead</strong> as a result of this. <strong>This is fucking incredible.</strong> This wouldn't have happened without three extremely dedicated, selfless, and amazing people. The world would have been a worse place. Even more children would have been suffering from preventable and debilitating lifelong conditions. But thanks to the folks at <a href=\"https://leadelimination.org/\">Lead Exposure Elimination Project</a>, they won\u2019t be.</li><li><strong>Moved across the world to reduce the suffering of farmed fish</strong>. These are people with no particular affinity for fish who became convinced of the plight that <a href=\"https://www.ciwf.org.uk/farm-animals/fish/#:~:text=Globally%2C%20between%2040%2D120%20billion,the%20world%20are%20farmed%20intensively.\">100 billion farmed fish</a> suffer. They didn\u2019t just feel sad about this and keep living their lives - they moved to India to start the world\u2019s first dedicated fish welfare charity, <a href=\"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/\">Fish Welfare Initiative</a>. To date, Fish Welfare Initiative <a href=\"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/impact\">estimates</a> they\u2019ve helped over 730,000 fish, and 1.3 million shrimp. Again, <strong>this is fucking awesome.</strong> FWI is on the ground, day in and day out, talking to fish farmers in India and trying to figure out the best ways to help fish.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Launched a </strong><a href=\"https://www.familyempowermentmedia.org/\"><strong>charity</strong></a><strong> focusing on empowering women in Nigeria</strong> with access to sexual and reproductive health information. Over 90,000 women die each year for complications from unintended pregnancies, and Family Empowerment Media has already reached 5.6 million people in Nigeria with vital contraceptive information. Because of their amazing and tireless work, girls and women are staying in school longer, earning more, and not suffering from unintended pregnancy complications.</li><li><strong>Left a lucrative and comfortable job in real estate to start the world\u2019s first charity advocating for </strong><a href=\"https://www.shrimpwelfareproject.org/\"><strong>shrimp welfare</strong></a>. He didn\u2019t always love shrimp, but when he found out that there are around 400 billion farmed shrimp every year, with almost no welfare standards, he had to do something. Now Shrimp Welfare Project is talking to shrimp producers in India, Vietnam and Ecuador, as well as large retailers in the UK, to improve the lives of billions of farmed shrimp. <strong>This is totally badass and necessary</strong>. And did I mention he now has a shrimp tattoo on his arm?</li></ul><p>Okay, I\u2019ll stop there. I could go on, as there are countless more examples that spring to mind, but this would get rather long. I feel truly lucky to be surrounded by such driven, altruistic and irrepressible people. Importantly, I\u2019m fairly sure that none of the projects would have happened without Effective Altruism, at least not in their current format. How do I know this? For one, all of these projects were incubated by an EA charity incubator, <a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/\">Charity Entrepreneurship</a>, who might not have existed without Effective Altruism as an idea or community.</p><p>Obviously, other people are doing amazing things too, but they\u2019re not the ones under attack in this case. There are plenty of ways to do good in the world, and sadly, many things we need to improve upon or change. Because of this, I\u2019m glad that Effective Altruists are taking one particular approach to improve the world. Similarly, I\u2019m extremely glad my activist friends, working with Extinction Rebellion, Just Stop Oil, Animal Rebellion, etc., are doing what they\u2019re doing in pressuring governments and proposing radical visions for the future. I think we need a <a href=\"https://ssir.org/articles/entry/philanthropists_must_invest_in_an_ecology_of_change\">plurality of approaches</a> to positively transform the world, so there\u2019s plenty of room for different <a href=\"https://evaluationhub.eif.org.uk/theory-of-change/\">theories of change</a>.</p><p>My challenge to the critiques of EA: Are you building a better alternative? Do you<strong> </strong>think you\u2019re the most you can, with the resources you have, to create a more just and fair world? If you already are, amazing! Thank you for your hard work. In this case, I urge you to not spend significant amounts of your time and energy pulling down others who have similar goals to improve the world, but who use different methods. We can, and we need to, co-exist together.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, I think criticism is extremely important for any organisation or movement, if delivered right. The EA community, in my opinion, is unusually open to criticism (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8hvmvrgcxJJ2pYR4X/announcing-a-contest-ea-criticism-and-red-teaming\">they offered $100,000</a> for the best critiques!), so I encourage any constructive critiques to be posted to the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/\">EA Forum</a>.

I believe that people\u2019s beliefs about the future of AI and \u201cAI takeoff scenarios\u201d may in large part depend on which of these two simple models they favor most strongly, and hence it seems worth making these models more explicit, so that we can better evaluate and critique them.</p><p>Among the two models I present, I myself happen to consider one of them significantly more plausible, and I will outline some of the reasons why I believe that.</p><p>The models I present may feel painfully basic, but I think it can be helpful to visit these most basic issues, as it seems to me that much disagreement springs from there.</p><h1><strong>\u201cAI skepticism\u201d?</strong></h1><p>It might be tempting to view the discussion of the contrasting models below as a clash between the \u201cAI priority\u201d camp and the \u201cAI skepticism\u201d camp. But I think this would be inaccurate. Neither of the two models I present imply that we should be unconcerned about AI, or indeed that avoiding catastrophic <a href=\"https://magnusvinding.com/2022/09/06/what-does-a-future-dominated-by-ai-imply/\">AI outcomes</a> should not be a top priority. Where the models will tend to disagree is more when it comes to <i>what kinds</i> of AI outcomes are most likely, and, as a consequence, <i>how</i> we can best address risks of bad AI outcomes. (More on this <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/two-contrasting-models-of-intelligence-and-future-growth#Potential_implications_for_altruistic_priorities\">below</a>.)</p><h1><strong>Two contrasting definitions of \u201cintelligence\u201d</strong></h1><p>Before outlining the two models of the development and future of \u201cintelligence\u201d, it is worth first specifying two distinct definitions of \u201cintelligence\u201d. These definitions are important, as the two contrasting models that I outline below see the relationship between these definitions of \u201cintelligence\u201d in very different ways.</p><p>The two definitions of intelligence are the following:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Intelligence 1:</strong> Individual cognitive abilities.</p><p><strong>Intelligence 2:</strong> The ability to achieve a wide range of goals.</p></blockquote><p>The first definition is arguably the common-sense definition of \u201cintelligence\u201d, and is often associated with constructs such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligence_quotient\">IQ</a> and the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G_factor_(psychometrics)\">g factor</a>. The second definition is more abstract, and is inspired by attempts to provide a broad definition of \u201cintelligence\u201d (see e.g. Legg &amp; Hutter, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/0712.3329.pdf\">2007</a>).</p><p>At a first glance, the difference between these two definitions may not be all that clear. After all, individual cognitive abilities can surely be classified as \u201cabilities to achieve a wide range of goals\u201d, meaning that Intelligence 1 can be seen as a subset of Intelligence 2. This seems fairly uncontroversial to say, and both of the models outlined below would agree with this claim.</p><p>Where substantive disagreement begins to enter the picture is when we explore the reverse relation. Is Intelligence 2 likewise a subset of Intelligence 1? In other words, are the two notions of \u201cintelligence\u201d virtually identical?</p><p>This is hardly the case. After all, abilities such as constructing a large building, or sending a spaceship to the moon, are not <i>purely</i> a product of individual cognitive abilities, even if cognitive abilities play crucial parts in such achievements.</p><p>The distance between Intelligence 1 and Intelligence 2 \u2014 or rather, how small or large of a subset Intelligence 1 is within Intelligence 2 \u2014 is a key point of disagreement between the two models outlined below, as will hopefully become clear shortly.</p><h1><strong>Two contrasting models of the development and future of \u201cintelligence\u201d</strong></h1><h2><strong>Simplified models at opposite ends of a spectrum</strong></h2><p>The two models I present below are extremely simple and coarse-grained, but I still think they capture some key aspects of how people tend to diverge in their thinking about the development and future of \u201cintelligence\u201d.</p><p>The models I present exist at opposite ends of a spectrum, where this spectrum can be seen as representing contrasting positions on the following issues:</p><ul><li>How large of a subset is Intelligence 1 within Intelligence 2? (Model 1: \u201cVery large\u201d vs. Model 2: \u201cRather modest\u201d).</li><li>How much of a bottleneck are individual human cognitive abilities to economic and technological growth? (Model 1: \u201cBy far the main bottleneck\u201d vs. Model 2: \u201cA significant bottleneck among many others\u201d).</li><li>How suddenly will the most growth-relevant human abilities be surpassed by machines? (Model 1: \u201cQuite suddenly, perhaps in months or weeks\u201d vs. Model 2: \u201cQuite gradually, in many decades or even millennia\u201d).</li></ul><p>These three issues are not strictly identical, but they are nevertheless closely related, in that beliefs that lie at one end of the spectrum on one of these issues will tend to push beliefs toward the corresponding end of the spectrum on the other two issues.</p><h2><strong>Model 1</strong></h2><p>Model 1 says that individual human cognitive abilities are by far the main driver of, and bottleneck to, economic and technological progress. It can perhaps best be described with a few illustrations.</p><p>The following figures are meant to illustrate how Model 1 sees the respective contributions of humanity and humanity\u2019s external tools to economic and technological progress over time. That is, the figures are meant to depict how much of a driver humanity is in creating technological and economic growth compared to how much of a driver our external tools and technologies are. (The illustrations are not to scale in any sense.)</p><p>The bar to the right tracks how large a proportion of human cognitive abilities that is surpassed by machines at the time in question, since this is the key measure to keep track of for Model 1.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:91.51%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194518/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/qtrzifjvdoz7wq5hvi0q.png\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194518/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/xrw2yoqk6bkbi8vck5tc.png 130w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194518/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/axf0bf8s4mvlzx6stdjt.png 260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194519/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/meefunhozds7uybuvsha.png 390w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194518/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/zuag38kmrrvlg0q8lmp3.png 520w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194519/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/dsxkxsq1cyicawlb2n65.png 650w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194518/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/tkvee6yymt8rvkwlchec.png 780w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194518/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/cwwzrfac9gp7lq611m54.png 910w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194518/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/kw1v2zjulp3tsrfbsstz.png 1040w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194519/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/tqawjxn1lrgfkq3s0ciu.png 1170w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194518/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/gwqqgt5jfq1fnmbopeic.png 1212w\"></figure><p>In 20.000 BC, we have relatively few tools and virtually no technological or economic progress (meant to be illustrated by the thin arrows).

The limiting factor will then be the AI systems themselves, which are continually growing themselves in ever more competent ways, in effect doubling the economy on a timescale of months or weeks, if not faster. The picture we started with has thus been reversed, and humans, if they are around anymore, are now but a tiny speck compared to the mushrooming Jupiter of AI.</p><h2><strong>Model 2</strong></h2><p>Model 2 disagrees with Model 1\u2019s claim that individual human cognitive abilities are by far the main driver of, and bottleneck to, economic and technological progress. According to Model 2, there are <i>many</i> bottlenecks to economic and technological progress, of which human cognitive abilities are but one \u2014 an important one, to be sure, but not necessarily one that is more important than others.</p><p>Broadly speaking, Model 2 focuses more on Intelligence 2 (the ability to achieve goals in general) than on Intelligence 1 (individual human cognitive abilities), and it sees a large difference between the two.</p><p>Since Model 2 does not see progress as being chiefly bottlenecked by Intelligence 1, it is also less interested in tracking the extent to which machines surpass humans along the dimension of Intelligence 1. Instead, Model 2 is more interested in tracking how well our machines and tools do in terms of the broader notion of Intelligence 2. In particular, Model 2 considers it more important to track the relative contribution of our external tools to humanity\u2019s ability to achieve goals in general, including the goal of creating technological progress.</p><p>Thus, the following figures are meant to illustrate how Model 2 sees the respective contributions of humanity and external human tools to economic and technological progress over time. And the bar to the right now tracks the relative contribution of external tools in humanity\u2019s technological progress (operationalized and tracked in accordance with Model 2).</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194519/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/gy8l8vuc3xrczxelnlhw.png\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194520/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/cryx2bsywjkcwxhew4hq.png 170w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194519/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/gwg6jcw5getzfnd3wniy.png 340w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194520/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/jys6u7cgdk077o9v5jjg.png 510w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194520/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/ng5j3gnxpbkcu6vozp3y.png 680w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194520/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/ydmzpdnxus5o8a7udvol.png 850w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194520/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/frv0tw79afma5geetefb.png 1020w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194519/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/mle34bbuhnjx0460ov5r.png 1190w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194519/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/lrrdm7dd7nnvcjgesn5i.png 1360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194519/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/wkhsnjz3ew0668qvymf9.png 1530w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194519/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/nhvnljehpf1wl80atwla.png 1630w\"><br>As we can see, Model 2 is largely in agreement with Model 1 in the year 20.000 BC.

Model 2 includes many distinct classes of external tools, as it sees each of them as significant bottlenecks to progress. (Model 2 sees these bottlenecks as markedly more significant than does Model 1, and Model 2 therefore represents them more prominently.)</p><p>Examples of these tools include scientific instruments, tools for food harvesting, tools for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_and_metallurgy_in_medieval_Europe\">mining</a>, etc. Model 2 highlights the complex interplay of these many different classes of tools, and how the existing set of tools in large part determines what new tools can be built \u2014 hence the large relative contribution in the progress bar.</p><p>Furthermore, Model 2 stresses the point that the latest, most advanced technologies are, already at this stage, crucial components in the creation of the next generation of technology.

Unlike in 1500, humanity has now made inventions such as computers, telephones, and combustion engines, which in turn unlock new avenues of innovation.</p><p>Humans gradually begin to emerge as a node in a network of factors \u2014 a network of tools, broadly construed \u2014 that are driving technological growth. Humans are, of course, a critically important node in this network, yet the same is increasingly true of the other nodes in the network. For example, if we instantly removed combustion engines or telecommunication in the world of 1950, economic and technological growth would have grinded to a halt \u2014 indeed turned negative \u2014 and it could not have resumed until these technologies (or their analogues) had been reinvented and widely redeployed.</p><p><br><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194519/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/y8gmygzi5ehkjn6hkyd0.png\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194519/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/pptcoxn2lo2cndu4zhuf.png 180w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194519/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/jf1gffhfd8mjk2hv8bxm.png 360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194520/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/s62jnobsruqtxnlriy3j.png 540w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194520/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/plgulo02f6ak4u3qkj8i.png 720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194520/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/k4kk9to7vr80hcuy9vfn.png 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194519/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/cwrjeouturnbazslaexw.png 1080w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194519/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/ogpqvliodvmgz0p9yopz.png 1260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194519/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/rr59mmipxsheuwbvpf7x.png 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194519/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/vc6i4ieobv2as1kqvsad.png 1620w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676194519/mirroredImages/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/vpaszp2gmaruyk38w9jn.png 1720w\"></p><p>In 2020, our interconnected web of tools has grown even larger, and our external tools likewise play a still greater role in the creation of new technologies. Humans now use computers and other machines on a large scale, including when they create the next generation of technology. Machines thus effectively do a large share of the work in tech development \u2014 in the design of new technologies, in calculations of optimal solutions to technical problems, in transportation, in manufacturing, etc.</p><p>Of course, machines still do not perform this work wholly independently (even as many manufacturing systems are now practically <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lights_out_(manufacturing)\">fully automated</a>). But this is a symmetric point, in that humans by no means perform the work independently either. Both humans and machines are necessary nodes in the network of tools that drive technological growth. And the core point on which Model 1 and Model 2 disagree is how large of a node \u2014 i.e. how large of a contributor and bottleneck \u2014 humans are compared to other nodes in this network.

Model 1 is essentially the story of how machines came to surpass humans in terms of their individual cognitive abilities \u2014 i.e. \u201cIntelligence 1\u201d, the chief driver of growth, according to Model 1 \u2014 and thereby rapidly took off on its own.</p><p>Model 2, in contrast, is essentially the story of how humans created an ever larger and more intricate set of tools that in turn expanded technological civilization\u2019s ability to achieve a wide range of goals, i.e. \u201cIntelligence 2\u201d, including the goal of creating further economic and technological growth. It is a story that sees the ability to create technological progress as <i>not</i> being chiefly determined by Intelligence 1, but as instead being determined and constrained by many factors of similar significance, such as the capabilities of specialized hardware tools found across a wide range of domains.</p><h1><strong>Examples of views that are loosely approximated by these models</strong></h1><p>Of course, neither of the models described above are a perfect illustration of anyone\u2019s views.

Hence, it seems that the key bottlenecks that we have overcome in the last 20.000 years \u2014 from our stable ~no-growth condition to our current state of technological advancement \u2014 have been unlocked by our collection of external tools and our collective cultural development. It is in large part by overcoming bottlenecks in these domains that humanity has created the economic and technological growth that we have seen in recent millennia (see also Muthukrishna &amp; Henrich, <a href=\"https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2015.0192\">2016</a>). This recent cultural and technological development is arguably what most distinguishes humans from chimpanzees, more so than our individual cognitive abilities in isolation (Henrich, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25761655-the-secret-of-our-success\">2015</a>, ch. 2; Vinding, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31800530-reflections-on-intelligence\">2016</a>; <a href=\"https://magnusvinding.com/2020/06/04/a-deceptive-analogy/\">2020</a>; Grace, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LDRQ5Zfqwi8GjzPYG/counterarguments-to-the-basic-ai-x-risk-case#Human_success_isn_t_from_individual_intelligence\">2022</a>).</p><h2><strong>Superhuman software capabilities increasingly advance technological development \u2014 yet growth rates appear to be declining</strong></h2><p>Model 1 emphasizes that computers could rapidly become not just a little better than humans, but <i>far</i> better than humans across virtually all cognitive domains. This would be a momentous event, according to Model 1, since computers themselves would then be driving scientific and technological progress at an unprecedented pace.</p><p>Model 2, in contrast, tends to emphasize how computers have already been superhuman in various domains for decades \u2014 and not just slightly superhuman, but vastly and increasingly superhuman (e.g. in multiplying astronomical numbers and in memory storage). Additionally, Model 2 highlights how superhuman software capabilities have already been pushing the frontier of scientific and technological development for decades, and how they continue to do so today.</p><p>For instance, supercomputers already help advance cutting-edge mathematics (see e.g. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_mathematics\">experimental mathematics</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_proof#Applications\">computer-assisted proofs</a>), and they are likewise among the main tools pushing physics forward, along with software in general. A recent example is how <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilyScssqVZQ&amp;ab_channel=CaltechPMA\">bootstrapping</a> methods run on supercomputers help to clarify the conditions that our physical theories (e.g. of gravity) must satisfy \u2014 what physicist Claudia de Rham <a href=\"https://www.quantamagazine.org/a-correction-to-einstein-hints-at-evidence-for-string-theory-20220121/\">called</a> \u201cone of the most exciting research developments at the moment\u201d in fundamental physics.</p><p>Compared to Model 1, Model 2 tends to see the gains from progress in software as being more uniformly distributed over time, as something that is reaped and translated into further technological progress in a rather gradual manner starting already decades ago. Model 2 expects a continuation of this trend, and hence it sees little reason to predict the kind of growth explosion that is predicted by Model 1.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxvy1rjrc2j\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxvy1rjrc2j\">[4]</a></sup></span></p><p>The respective predictions that Model 1 and Model 2 make about what we should observe in our current condition are thus another reason why I consider Model 2 more plausible. For if Model 1 sees human cognitive abilities as the key bottleneck to technological growth, a bottleneck whose unwinding would effectively give rise to a growth explosion, and if computers increasingly surpass human cognitive abilities and increasingly sit at the forefront of technological development, then Model 1 would seem to predict that growth rates should now be steadily rising.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzl9ixjzhqqs\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzl9ixjzhqqs\">[5]</a></sup></span></p><p>Yet what we observe is arguably the opposite. Economic and technological growth rates appear to be steadily decreasing, across <a href=\"https://magnusvinding.com/2021/06/07/reasons-not-to-expect-a-growth-explosion/#rates-of-innovation-and-progress-in-science-have-slowed-down\">various measures</a>, despite superhuman cognitive abilities \u2014 and software in general \u2014 playing an <a href=\"https://hplusmagazine.com/2010/11/11/top-five-reasons-singularity-misnomer/\">increasingly</a> <a href=\"https://www.statista.com/outlook/tmo/software/worldwide#revenue\">large role</a> in economic and technological development. This weakly suggests that progress in creating and employing superhuman software capabilities has <a href=\"http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2014/02/why-ais-wont-ascend-in-blink-of-an-eye.html\">diminishing returns</a> in terms of its effects on economic and technological growth rates.

Below are some specific examples. None of these examples represent strong evidence against a future growth explosion in themselves; they each merely count as weak evidence against it.

There are countless processes and tools involved, and improvements in a wide range of this set of tools \u2014 like what we saw around the 1960s, according to Gordon \u2014 will tend to lead to greater growth. Conversely, when an increasing number of these key tools can no longer be improved much further, such that only a comparatively limited set of tools in our collective toolbox see significant improvements, the growth of the whole system will likewise tend to be more modest, as it is partly constrained by the components that are no longer improving much.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefm2v5twnbas\"><sup><a href=\"#fnm2v5twnbas\">[13]</a></sup></span></p><p>In other words, this picture suggests that the various areas in which we are now approaching the theoretical ceilings will be, if they are not indeed already, considerable bottlenecks to growth.</p><h3><strong>An unprecedented decline in economic growth rates across doublings</strong></h3><p>A final observation that I wish to draw attention to is that the decline in economic growth rates that we have witnessed in recent decades is in some sense unprecedented in the entire history of human growth over the last million years.</p><p>The world economy has seen roughly <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.KD\">three doublings</a> since 1960.

But it does serve as counter-evidence to a claim that is sometimes made in favor of a future growth explosion, namely that the history of economic growth suggests that we are headed for a new, even faster growth mode (see e.g. Hanson, <a href=\"https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/longgrow.pdf\">2000</a>; note that Hanson likewise mostly bases his claims on DeLong\u2019s <a href=\"http://holtz.org/Library/Social%20Science/Economics/Estimating%20World%20GDP%20by%20DeLong/Estimating%20World%20GDP.htm\">estimates</a>).</p><p>The unprecedented growth decline that we have seen over the past three doublings may be taken as weak inductive evidence that we are generally headed for slower rather than faster growth, and that we might now find ourselves past a long era of increasing growth rates (see also Modis, <a href=\"http://www.growth-dynamics.com/articles/Singularity.pdf\">2012</a>, pp. 20-22).</p><p>This wouldn\u2019t be extremely surprising, given that we have <a href=\"https://magnusvinding.com/2020/05/04/the-future-of-growth-near-zero-growth-rates/\">good reasons</a> to think that current growth rates can at most continue for a couple of thousand years, and perhaps only a few hundred years. For example, estimates suggest that a continuation of current growth rates in information processing would hit ultimate <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/astro-ph/0404510.pdf\">theoretical limits</a> in less than <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Cnj8MIQ0HY&amp;t=2377\">250 years</a>. Hence, if future economic growth will be strongly tied to growth in computation, we have some reason to think that current economic growth rates cannot be sustained for much longer than a couple of centuries either.</p><p>In light of such strikingly imminent limits \u2014 whether they lie a few thousand or a few hundred years ahead \u2014 it would not be <i>that</i> surprising if we are already now witnessing a gradual slowdown in growth rates. After all, as mentioned <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/two-contrasting-models-of-intelligence-and-future-growth#The_fastest_supercomputers_and_other_hardware_measures\">earlier</a>, we should arguably expect a gradual decline in growth rates to set in a good while before we hit ultimate limits.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmbm8sfw231m\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmbm8sfw231m\">[17]</a></sup></span></p><p>Again, none of the considerations I have outlined above are in themselves strong reasons to doubt a future growth explosion. But I find that they do begin to paint a fairly compelling picture when put together.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefm3oixc3k2v\"><sup><a href=\"#fnm3oixc3k2v\">[18]</a></sup></span></p><h1><strong>Objections</strong></h1><p>Below are a couple of counterpoints that may be raised in favor of Model 1, along with my comments on them.</p><h3><strong>Some versions of Model 1 are consistent with the evidence</strong></h3><p><i>There are versions of Model 1 that do not predict gradually rising growth rates when just any set of human cognitive abilities get surpassed, yet which do predict explosive growth rates once AI systems exceed humans in the right set of cognitive skills. Specifically, there may well be a certain set of cognitive skills relevant to growth such that, once AI systems surpass humans along those dimensions, then we will see explosive growth. These skills may include strategic planning or the ability to write code.&nbsp;</i></p><p>I think it is worth taking this hypothesis seriously, and to carefully scrutinize its plausibility. The following are some of the reasons why I am skeptical.</p><p>Probably the main reason I consider this picture unlikely is that it still seems to overlook the multitude of bottlenecks that work against explosive growth. In particular, it still appears to ignore the increasingly challenging constraints found in the realm of hardware and hardware production. It is difficult to see how greatly improving a given set of cognitive abilities would vastly improve the process of hardware production, since hardware production in large part seems bottlenecked by the sophistication of our hardware itself, not just information.</p><p>To be sure, improvements in domains such as strategic planning and coding may produce considerable gains. Yet would these gains be enough to not only get us back to something that resembles the growth in computational <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koomey's_law\">efficiency</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Kryder#Kryder's_law_projection\">memory</a>, <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2016-03-12/after-moores-law\">processing speed</a>, and <a href=\"https://magnusvinding.com/2021/06/07/reasons-not-to-expect-a-growth-explosion/#the-growth-of-supercomputers-has-been-slowing-down-for-years\">performance</a> that we saw more than a decade ago, but also enough to positively exceed those growth rates by a considerable margin?</p><p>I think we have good reasons to doubt that, and it is worth reiterating that the reasons to be skeptical are partly a matter of hard physical limits, many of which we have practically already reached or are close to reaching (as mentioned <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7cCr6vAmN4Xi3yzR5/two-contrasting-models-of-intelligence-and-future-growth#Many_key_technologies_only_have_modest_room_for_further_growth\">above</a>).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefg5jamds8bwa\"><sup><a href=\"#fng5jamds8bwa\">[19]</a></sup></span></p><p>It is also worth asking why progress in surpassing a particular set of human cognitive abilities, such as strategic planning, should give rise to explosive growth, when vastly surpassing other human cognitive abilities \u2014 e.g. in various calculation tasks since around 1950 \u2014 has not resulted in explosive growth (even as it has helped power recent growth).</p><p>After all, it is not clear why future progress in surpassing human cognitive abilities should boost growth rates more than did past progress of this kind. For example, one could argue that past progress likely reaped the low-hanging fruit, particularly in the domains where computers have the clearest advantages compared to humans, and that software progress is now facing diminishing returns in terms of how much it will boost growth rates going forward. Again, this is arguably consistent with the patterns that we currently observe, with the growth rates of the global economy and growth in computer hardware steadily declining.</p><p>In other words, expectations of greater increases in growth rates from future progress compared to past progress seem to call for an explanation, especially since past trends and our current trajectory can seem to suggest the opposite.</p><h3><strong>We should chiefly focus on Model 1 regardless</strong></h3><p><i>For any set of plausible credences in Model 1 and Model 2, we should still give far more priority to scenarios that conform to Model 1, as they seem far more consequential and worrying.</i></p><p>Model 2 also implies many serious risks, and it is not clear that these are significantly less consequential.</p><p>After all, near-term growth rates do not seem critical to the size of the future. If one assumes an eventual colonization wave that occurs near the speed of light, there is virtually no difference between whether such a wave is approached through something like 3 percent annual growth or whether it is approached at the fastest pace allowed by the laws of physics. These two scenarios would likely only differ by a few hundred \u2014 or at most a few thousand \u2014 years in terms of when they start expanding at the speed of light (cf. Krauss, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Cnj8MIQ0HY&amp;t=2377s\">2011</a>; Vinding, <a href=\"https://magnusvinding.com/2020/05/04/the-future-of-growth-near-zero-growth-rates/\">2017a</a>). That difference becomes proportionally minuscule as time progresses, implying that a slight difference in the quality of the respective colonization waves would be far more consequential than their respective starting times.</p><p>Second, it seems that many specific risks that one might worry about in the context of Model 1 would have analogues in Model 2, including risks of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/KqCybin8rtfP3qztq/agi-and-lock-in\">lock-in</a> scenarios.</p><p>Third, one could argue that we have greater reason to focus mostly on Model 2 scenarios. For example, one could argue that Model 2 and its basic predictions seem significantly more plausible (as I have tried to do above). Additionally, one may argue that we have a better chance of having a beneficial impact under Model 2 \u2014 e.g. because the effects of interventions might generally be more predictable in Model 2 scenarios, and because such scenarios give us more time to understand and implement genuinely helpful interventions. Likewise, one might think that Model 2 implies a significantly lower risk of <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/accidental-harm/\">accidentally</a> making things much worse. For instance, it seems plausible that Model 1 scenarios come with a significantly greater risk of unwittingly creating suffering on a vast scale, which may be an additional reason to focus more on Model 2 scenarios (cf. Trammell\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cYf6Xx8w7bt9ivbon/which-world-gets-saved\">Which World Gets Saved</a>\u201d and Tomasik\u2019s \u201c<a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/near-miss/\">Astronomical suffering from slightly misaligned artificial intelligence</a>\u201d).</p><p>Fourth, even if we were to grant that Model 1 scenarios deserve greater priority, one could still argue that such scenarios are currently overprioritized among people concerned about creating beneficial AI outcomes in the long term, and hence that it would be better to give greater priority to Model 2 scenarios on the current margin. For example, one might think that the current focus is roughly 80/20 in favor of Model 1 (among people working to create beneficial AI outcomes), whereas it should ideally only be, say, 60/40 in favor of Model 1.</p><p>Lastly, I think it is worth flagging how priority-related assumptions of the kind expressed in the objection above can potentially distort our views and priorities. For one, such assumptions about how some scenarios and worldviews deserve far more priority than others might be risky in that they may reduce our motivation to carefully explore which outcomes are in fact most likely. Moreover, to the extent that we do seriously explore which outcomes are most likely, there is a risk that priority-related assumptions of this kind will exert an undue influence on our descriptive picture \u2014 e.g. if we are inclined to downplay a line of argument for priority-related reasons, we might confuse ourselves as to whether we also disagree for purely descriptive reasons. It may be difficult to keep these classes of reasons separate in our minds, and to not let priority-related reasons pollute our descriptive worldview.</p><p>Worrying, too, is the empirically documented tendency of \u201c<a href=\"https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10108033/1/Belief%20Digitization%20Final.pdf\">belief digitization</a>\u201d, namely the tendency to wholly dismiss a less plausible hypothesis when making inferences and decisions, even when one acknowledges that the hypothesis in question still deserves considerable weight. This tendency could lead us to assign unduly low credences to scenarios that might not seem most likely or most worrisome, yet which still deserve considerable weight and priority (in line with the previous point about the possibility that we underprioritize Model 2 scenarios on the current margin, even if we believe that Model 1 scenarios deserve the most weight in absolute terms).</p><h1><strong>Potential implications for altruistic priorities</strong></h1><p>In closing, I will briefly outline what I see as some of the main implications of updating more toward Model 2 compared to Model 1 (if one were to make such an update).</p><p>There is obviously much uncertainty as to what the exact implications would be, but it seems that a<strong> </strong>greater credence in Model 2 likely pushes toward:</p><ul><li>Comparatively less focus on individual AI systems.<ul><li>Individual AI systems in themselves are less likely to be the critical determinants of future outcomes on Model 2. This is not to say that the design of individual AI systems is unimportant on Model 2, but merely that it becomes <i>less</i> important.</li></ul></li><li>A greater focus on improving institutions and other \u201cbroader\u201d factors, e.g. norms and values.<ul><li>This may be the most promising lever with which to steer civilization in better directions in scenarios with more distributed growth and power, as it has the potential to simultaneously influence a vast number of actors, creating better equilibria for how they cooperate and make decisions.</li><li>Note that a focus on institutions would <a href=\"https://magnusvinding.com/2022/09/06/what-does-a-future-dominated-by-ai-imply/#a-future-dominated-by-ai-does-not-mean-that-either-technical-ai-safety-or-ai-governance-is-most-promising\">not</a> necessarily just mean a focus on AI governance in particular, but also better political institutions and practices in a broader sense.</li></ul></li><li>More research on what could go wrong in Model 2 scenarios.<ul><li>For example, what are the most worrying lock-in dynamics that might occur in these scenarios, and how might they come about? How can they best be prevented?</li></ul></li></ul><p>Updating more toward Model 2 would by no means change everything, but it would still imply significant changes in altruistic priorities.</p><h1><strong>Acknowledgments</strong></h1><p>Thanks to Tobias Baumann for suggesting that I write this post. I am also grateful to the people who gave feedback on these ideas at a recent retreat and in writing.</p><h1><strong>Appendix A: Critical questions regarding the models</strong></h1><p>It seems worth briefly reviewing a couple of critical points and questions that one might raise in response to the two basic models reviewed in this post.</p><h3><strong>Just qualitative models?</strong></h3><p>One critique might be that the two models presented here are merely qualitative, and hence they are less useful than proper quantitative models of future growth. I would make two points in response to this sentiment.</p><p>First, it seems that qualitative models are a good place to start if we want to think straight about a given issue. In particular, if we want to make sure that the more elaborate models we construct are plausible, we have good reason to first make sure that we base these models on plausible assumptions about the nature of technological growth, especially as far as the key drivers and bottlenecks are concerned.</p><p>This brings me to the second point, which is that quantitative models are only as good as the underlying assumptions on which they rest. A qualitative model can thus be more useful than a quantitative model, if the qualitative model better reflects reality in terms of the core assumptions and predictions it makes. That being said, it would, of course, be ideal to have quantitative models that do rest on accurate assumptions.</p><p>The two models presented here are not meant to provide precise quantitative predictions (even as they do provide some rough predictions), but rather to illustrate an underlying source of disagreement in a simple and intuitive way.</p><h3><strong>How do the models presented here relate to the economic models presented in Aghion et al., </strong><a href=\"http://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/AJJ-AIandGrowth.pdf\"><strong>2019</strong></a><strong>?</strong></h3><p>The models presented by Aghion et al. relate quite closely to the models presented in this post. The first model they present is an automation model in which a set of tasks that are difficult to automate serve as a bottleneck to more rapid economic growth \u2014 a model that seems to describe recent growth trends reasonably well (Aghion et al., <a href=\"http://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/AJJ-AIandGrowth.pdf\">2019</a>, sec. 9.2).</p><p>The authors then proceed to describe various models that are similar to Model 1, in which growth becomes ever faster due to greater automation or self-improving AI (Aghion et al., <a href=\"http://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/AJJ-AIandGrowth.pdf\">2019</a>, sec. 9.4). Yet it is worth noting that the authors do not claim that any of these models are plausible. Indeed, these abstract models are in some sense trivially <i>im</i>plausible, at least in the limit, since they either imply that economic output becomes infinite in finite time, or that growth rates will increase exponentially without bounds.</p><p>Furthermore, concerning the equations that the authors use to formalize an intelligence explosion, they note that there are reasons to believe that those equations \u201cwould not be the correct specifications\u201d, and they go on to discuss these reasons, \u201cwhich can broadly be characterized as \u2018bottlenecks\u2019 that AI cannot resolve\u201d (Aghion et al., <a href=\"http://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/AJJ-AIandGrowth.pdf\">2019</a>, p. 258). These reasons relate to Model 2, in that Model 2 can be seen as an intuitive illustration of some of the counterpoints that Aghion et al. raise against the plausibility of automation/AI-driven explosive growth (in Section 9.4.2).</p><p>Overall, Aghion et al. do not appear to take a strong stance against a future growth explosion driven by AI, but my impression is that they are tentatively skeptical.</p><h3><strong>How do the points made in favor of Model 2 in this post relate to the conclusions drawn in Davidson </strong><a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/could-advanced-ai-drive-explosive-economic-growth/\"><strong>2021</strong></a><strong>?</strong></h3><p>Davidson concludes that it is plausible (&gt;10 percent likely) that \u2018explosive growth\u2019 \u2014 by which he means &gt;30 percent annual global economic growth \u2014 will occur before 2100. Yet it is worth noting that 30 percent annual growth is <i>far</i> closer to current growth rates than to the growth rates found in an economy that doubles on the order of months, weeks, or shorter. For example, an economy that doubles every other month would see 6300 percent annual growth(!), whereas an economy that doubles every week would see more than&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"4*10^{15}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mn\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.372em;

<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26831944-the-age-of-em\">2016</a>). And assigning &gt;10 percent probability to &gt;30 percent annual growth is obviously far less radical than is assigning &gt;10 percent probability to &gt;6300 percent annual growth, let alone to &gt;4 quadrillion percent annual growth. Worth noting, too, is that Davidson seems to assign an even <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/report-on-whether-ai-could-drive-explosive-economic-growth/\">higher</a> probability to a growth slowdown: \u201cI place at least 25% probability on the global economy only doubling every ~50 years by 2100\u201d; \u201cmy central estimate is not stable, but it is currently around 40%\u201d. This seems broadly consistent with the arguments I have presented in favor of Model 2 (although I would place strictly <i>less </i>than 10 percent probability on &gt;30 percent growth rates in light of these arguments).</p><h3><strong>How does one operationalize the quantities measured by the respective \u201cprogress bars\u201d in the figures above?</strong></h3><p>This is a fair question. There is obviously no single right way to operationalize \u201cthe proportion of individual human cognitive abilities surpassed by machines\u201d or \u201cthe relative contribution of external tools to human technological progress\u201d. But I also don\u2019t think much hinges on the exact operationalization. The main point is that Model 1 and Model 2 disagree on what kinds of progress are most informative to track. The exact positions of the progress bars are thus not critical, in contrast to the underlying points that the respective bars are meant to illustrate.</p><h1><strong>Appendix B: Peak AI growth occurring roughly now?

In particular, while the compute and parameter sizes of large language models have been growing rapidly in recent years (<a href=\"https://medium.com/riselab/ai-and-memory-wall-2cb4265cb0b8\">roughly</a> at a rate of 750x and 240x every two years, respectively), the growth in memory capacity and bandwidth has been much slower (roughly 1.4x to 2.0x every two years). <a href=\"https://medium.com/riselab/ai-and-memory-wall-2cb4265cb0b8\">Some researchers</a> have argued that this differential growth rate makes memory an ever more significant bottleneck over time (see also Bergal et al., <a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/trends-in-dram-price-per-gigabyte/\">2020</a>).</p><p>Similarly, there are reasons to think that training data is yet another critical bottleneck to the capabilities of AI models, and one that is also getting increasingly significant. In particular, training data is now \u2014 at least in some respects \u2014 a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6Fpvch8RR29qLEWNH/chinchilla-s-wild-implications\">greater bottleneck</a> to the improvement of large AI models than is model size per se. And extrapolations of <a href=\"https://epochai.org/blog/trends-in-training-dataset-sizes\">recent trends</a> in the amount of data used to train AI models <a href=\"https://epochai.org/blog/will-we-run-out-of-ml-data-evidence-from-projecting-dataset\">suggest</a> that AI training runs will soon be using practically all the high-quality language data that is available; \u201clikely before 2026\u201d (Villalobos et al., <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.04325.pdf\">2022</a>, p. 1). Language models are typically trained on high-quality language data, yet the total stock of such data is less than a single order of magnitude larger than the largest datasets that have already been used to train AI models, implying that current AI models are surprisingly close to using all of our existing high-quality data (Villalobos et al., <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.04325.pdf\">2022</a>, p. 1). (See also Buckman, <a href=\"https://jacobbuckman.com/2022-09-07-recursively-self-improving-ai-is-already-here/\">2022</a>; <a href=\"https://jacobbuckman.substack.com/p/we-arent-close-to-creating-a-rapidly\">2023</a>.)</p><p>The three reasons reviewed above \u2014 the economic constraints to growth in AI model sizes, the memory wall, and the training data bottleneck \u2014 each independently suggest that the relative growth of the capabilities of large AI models is likely to slow down within the next few years. Of course, there are also considerations that point in the opposite direction \u2014 e.g. perhaps economic growth could indeed explode within the next few years, perhaps engineers will find ways to get around the memory wall, and perhaps AI can generate vast amounts of high-quality language data on its own. Such possibilities cannot be ruled out. But the considerations reviewed above still represent substantial reasons to believe that the relative rates of progress that we have seen in AI recently \u2014 i.e. over the last decade \u2014 are unlikely to be sustained for long.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7dmkxcbijql\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7dmkxcbijql\">[23]</a></sup></span></p><h1><strong>References</strong></h1><p>Aaronson, S.

Both Gordon\u2019s and Cowen\u2019s books focus on American growth, yet they still capture much of the global picture, since the US economy accounted for roughly 40 percent of the global economy in 1960, and hence it drove much of the global growth in that period.</p><p>Charles Jones likewise argues that most of the growth that the US economy has seen since the 1950s has been due to zero-to-one improvements that cannot be repeated, e.g. misallocations of resources that cannot be corrected much further. A smaller fraction of growth, around 20 percent, has been due to an increase in population, which is the only factor in the growth model presented by Jones that could keep on driving growth in the long term (Jones, <a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/annualreview.pdf\">2022</a>).</p><p>Yet note that even population growth cannot continue at a high rate for long.

(And the usual disclaimers about not being able to provide legal advice to entities/people other than Open Phil still apply.) But I can lay out some principles and processes that should help people make better-informed decisions. Unfortunately this probably cannot be reliably exported to non-US contexts.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Are My Records Going to Become Public?</h1><p>I think the most useful piece of information I\u2019ve been able to give people who have asked about this kind of thing in the last two weeks is that being asked to turn things over to an investigation or discovery process does not mean you have to turn entire email servers or hard drives over. You only have to turn over what\u2019s responsive to the inquiry. And having to turn over your materials does not automatically mean that they become public.&nbsp;</p><p>The materials will probably go to some windowless legal office where dozens of junior attorneys (or interns) are listening to podcasts under fluorescent lights while combing through thousands of pages of documents trying to find stuff that\u2019s relevant to the matter they\u2019re working on. When they do notice something that could be relevant, they\u2019ll stop and read more carefully. If it informs the matter, even in a small way, it could become an exhibit in a litigation proceeding, and that would make it accessible to the public, and therefore fair game for the media.&nbsp;</p><p>It\u2019s uncommon for these review processes to dig into issues that aren\u2019t relevant to the proceeding that triggered the discovery. The peccadillos of day-to-day life are unlikely to draw additional investigative scrutiny.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, if, for example, you\u2019re regularly corresponding with Sam Bankman-Fried or Caroline Ellison, I would just assume all of that correspondence is going to be relevant and, eventually, public. The farther removed the correspondence is from anyone at the epicenter of any investigations, or from investigation-relevant subject-matter, the less likely it is to have to be turned over, or if turned over, made public.&nbsp;</p><p>A final, minor, point: if you\u2019re worried about leaks, I think it\u2019s fair to say that most of those don\u2019t come from legal teams, who would be risking their careers and credentials in leaking confidential material.&nbsp;</p><p>Quick recap of the process:&nbsp;</p><p>Discovery request or subpoena \u2192 you turn over material responsive to the request \u2192 junior lawyers look through massive quantity of information for relevant material \u2192 relevant material may become an exhibit in legal proceedings, which are accessible to the public \u2192 material accessible to the public can get picked up in the media&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Should I save/delete everything?&nbsp;&nbsp;</h1><p>Legal obligations to preserve documents generally hinge on whether you have a \u201creasonable anticipation of litigation.\u201d This can mean you think you\u2019re actually going to be a party to a lawsuit (either because you sue someone, or they sue you). It could also mean that you get a discovery demand or a subpoena or some other formal notice from a court.&nbsp;</p><p>If something does trigger a legal obligation to preserve documents, you need to make sure that the material in your possession that could be relevant to the proceeding in question doesn\u2019t get deleted. For example, if you use Signal a lot, and you have Signal messages set to delete after a week, you should screenshot any relevant texts before they get deleted. You should also turn off deleting for any threads that might end up containing relevant information in future conversations.&nbsp;</p><p>A few rules of thumb on preservation after the duty to preserve has been triggered:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Once you have a legal obligation to preserve docs, that is ongoing, so as new documents get created, the same obligations will apply to them.</li><li>Even if you delete something, keep in mind that the person you\u2019re corresponding with may have preserved it for their own reasons or to satisfy their own obligations. Conduct yourself accordingly.</li><li>Generally if you have to ask yourself \u201cwill I be seen as engaging in a cover-up if I delete this document?\u201d then you shouldn\u2019t delete the document.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br>Even if you don\u2019t have any legal obligation to preserve documents, you may choose to retain stuff for your own benefit. For example, you may want to save documents that demonstrate your own lack of culpability, or that establish you have a claim against someone else. Or if you think you may be drawn into bankruptcy proceedings, you may want to keep relevant records of your dealings with the grantor and financial documentation. These could help you establish a claim as a creditor or defenses against clawbacks later.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><h1>Looking Ahead</h1><p>I\u2019ve said this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/o8B9kCkwteSqZg9zc/thoughts-on-legal-concerns-surrounding-the-ftx-situation\"><u>before</u></a>, but the bankruptcy proceedings are going to play out very slowly.

These are initiatives that either try to identify publicly accessible philanthropic funding opportunities using an effective-altruism-inspired methodology (<i>evaluators</i>), or to fundraise for the funding opportunities that have already been identified (<i>fundraisers</i>), or both.</p><p>Over 25 of these organisations and projects are purely fundraisers and do not have any research capacity of their own: they have to rely on evaluators for their giving recommendations, and in practice currently mainly rely on three of those: GiveWell, Animal Charity Evaluators and Founders Pledge.&nbsp;</p><p>At the moment, fundraisers and individual donors have very little to go on to select which evaluators they rely on and how to curate the exact recommendations and donations they make. These decisions seem to be made based on public reputation of evaluators, personal impressions and trust, and perhaps in some cases a lack of information about existing alternatives or simple legacy/historical artefact. Furthermore, many fundraisers currently maintain separate relationships with the evaluators they use recommendations from and with the charities they end up recommending, causing extra overhead for all involved parties.</p><p>Considering this situation and from checking with a subset of fundraising organisations, it seems there is a pressing need for (1) a quality check on new and existing evaluators (\u201cevaluating the evaluators\u201d) and (2) an accessible overview of all recommendations made by evaluators whose methodology meets a certain quality standard. This need is becoming more pressing with the ecosystem growing both on the supply (evaluator) and demand (fundraiser) side.</p><p><strong>The new GWWC research team is looking to start filling this gap: to help connect evaluators and donors/fundraisers in the effective giving ecosystem in a more effective (higher-quality recommendations) and efficient (lower transaction costs) way.</strong></p><p>Starting in 2023, the GWWC research team plan to evaluate funding opportunity evaluators on their methodology, to share our findings with other effective giving organisations and projects, and to promote the recommendations of those evaluators that we find meet a certain quality standard. In all of this, we aim to take an inclusive approach in terms of worldviews and values: we are open to evaluating all evaluators that could be seen to maximise positive impact according to some reasonably common worldview or value system, even though we appreciate the challenge here and admit we can never be perfectly \u201cneutral\u201d.</p><p>We also appreciate this is an ambitious project for a small team (currently only 2!) to take on, and expect it to take us time to build our capacity to evaluate all suitable evaluators at the quality level at which we'd like to evaluate them. Especially in this first year, we may be limited in the number of evaluators we can evaluate and in the time we can spend on evaluating each, and we may not yet be able to provide the full \"quality check\" we aim to ultimately provide. We'll try to prioritise our time to address the most pressing needs first, and aim to communicate transparently about the confidence of our conclusions, the limitations of our processes, and the mistakes we are inevitably going to make.</p><p>We very much welcome any questions or feedback on our plans, and look forward to working with others on further improving the state of the effective giving ecosystem, getting more money to where it is needed most, and ultimately on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/strategy\"><u>making giving effectively and significantly a cultural norm</u></a><u>.</u></p>", "user": {"username": "SjirH"}}, {"_id": "rxojcFfpN88YNwGop", "title": "Rethink Priorities\u2019 Leadership Statement on the FTX situation", "postedAt": "2022-11-23T22:54:56.079Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>From the Executive Team and Board of Directors of Rethink Priorities (Peter Wildeford, Marcus Davis, Abraham Rowe, Kieran Greig, David Moss, Ozzie Gooen, Cameron Meyer Shorb, and Vicky Bond).</i></p><p>We were saddened and shocked to learn about the extremely serious alleged misdeeds and misconduct of Sam Bankman-Fried and FTX. While we are still trying to understand what happened and the consequences of these events, we are dismayed that customer funds may have been used improperly, and that, currently, many customers are unable to retrieve funds held by FTX. We unequivocally and in the strongest possible terms condemn any potential fraud or misuse of customer funds and trust that occurred at FTX. The actions that Bankman-Fried and FTX have been accused of are out of line with the values that we believe in and try to represent as an organization.</p><p>At this time, Rethink Priorities remains in a stable financial and legal position. We do not plan on laying off staff or cutting salaries in response to these events or to the changed financial condition of the EA space. However, the strategies of our General Longtermism, Special Projects, and Surveys teams were partly based on the existence of FTX funding for Rethink Priorities and others in the EA community. For the time being, we've mainly paused further hiring for these programs and are revisiting our strategies for them going forward. We\u2019ve decided that hiring for our Special Projects team, which was already in progress before we learned about the FTX situation, will proceed in order to evaluate and onboard new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/AFgvA9imsT6bww8E3/announcing-the-rethink-priorities-special-projects-program\"><u>fiscal sponsees</u></a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, this situation does impact our long-term financial outlook and our ability to keep growing. Rethink Priorities continues to have large funding needs and we look forward to sharing more about our plans with the community in the next few days. We will need to address the funding gap left by these changed conditions for the coming years.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of legal exposure, Rethink Priorities\u2019 legal counsel are looking into the possibility of clawbacks of funds previously donated to us by FTX-related sources. At this time, we are not aware of any other significant legal exposure for Rethink Priorities or its staff.</p><p>Prior to the news breaking this month, we already had procedures in place intended to mitigate potential financial risks from relying on FTX or other cryptocurrency donors. Internally, we've always had a practice of treating pledged or anticipated cryptocurrency donations as less reliable than other types of donations for fundraising forecasting purposes, simply due to volatility in that sector. As a part of regular crisis management exercises, we also engaged in an internal simulation in August around the possibility of FTX funds no longer being available. We did this exercise due to the relative size and importance of the funding to us, and the base failure rates of cryptocurrency projects, not due to having non-public information about FTX or Bankman-Fried.</p><p>In hindsight, we believe we could have done more to share these internal risk assessments with the rest of the EA community. Going forward, we are reevaluating our own approach to risk management and the assessment of donors, though we do not believe any changes we will make would have caught this specific issue.</p><p>As mentioned above, Rethink Priorities is receiving legal advice on clawbacks, and we are happy to share resources with other organizations that are concerned about their exposure.

They say that the editor's note provides 'balance' for the reader. They haven't explained how their false tweet remains acceptable. By these standards, media outlets don't have to correct false claims in articles, they just have to include editor's notes contradicting the false claims. There are apparently no constraints on what media outlets are permitted to tweet.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dear Ms Stover,&nbsp;</p><p>I have long admired the work of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. However, I am extremely disappointed by your publication of the latest piece by Emile Torres.&nbsp;</p><p>I knew long ago that Torres would publish a piece critical of&nbsp;<i>What We Owe the Future,</i> and on me following my report on climate change. However, I am surprised that the Bulletin has chosen to publish this particular piece in its current form. There are many things wrong with the piece, but the most important is that it accuses Will MacAskill and his research assistants of research misconduct. Specifically, Torres contends that five of the climate experts we listed in the acknowledgements for the book were not actually consulted.&nbsp;</p><p>Ms Stover: you contacted us about this claim in advance of the article\u2019s publication, and we informed you that it was not true. Overall, we consulted around 106 experts in the research process for&nbsp;<i>What We Owe The Future.&nbsp;</i>Torres suggests that five experts were never consulted at all, but this is not true \u2014 as Will stated in his earlier email to you, four of those five experts&nbsp;<i>were</i> consulted. I am happy to provide evidence for this. The article would have readers think that we made up the citations out of thin air. One of them was contacted but didn\u2019t have time to give feedback, and was incorrectly credited in the acknowledgements, which we will change in future editions: this was an honest mistake. The Bulletin also went on to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthewgburgess/status/1595206852949970944\"><u>tweet</u></a> the false claim that multiple people hadn\u2019t been consulted at all.</p><p>The acknowledgements are also clear that we are not claiming that those listed checked and agreed with every claim in the book. Immediately after the acknowledgements of subject-matter experts, Will writes: \u201cThese advisers don\u2019t necessarily agree with the claims I make in the book, and all errors in the book are my responsibility alone.\u201d</p><p>To accuse someone of research misconduct is a very serious allegation. After you check it and find out that it is false, it is extremely poor form to let the claim go out anyway and then to tweet it. The Bulletin should issue a correction to the article, and to the false claim they put out in a tweet.</p><p>I also have concerns about the nature of Torres\u2019 background work for article \u2014&nbsp;they seemingly sent every person that was acknowledged for the book a misleading email, telling them that we lied in the acknowledgements, and making some reviewers quite&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/matthewgburgess/status/1595206852949970944\"><u>uncomfortable</u></a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>To reiterate, I am very disappointed by the journalistic standards demonstrated in this article. I will be publishing something separately about Torres\u2019 (as usual) misrepresented substantive claims, but the most serious allegation of research misconduct needs to be retracted and we need an apology.&nbsp;</p><p>(Also, a more minor point: it's not true that I am Head of Applied Research at Founders Pledge.

Nate Soares provides in his series a comprehensive guide for the same; here I'll be briefing Part 3 of the series which I think is key to reaching the objective.</p><p>In Part 1, the author addresses the most common type of guilt: <i>listless guilt. </i>The spiral-inducing guilt originated from simply not doing or able-to-do anything in life. One must be encouraged to search for his fight in such a scenario-finding what is wrong around you and how you can try to do efforts to change what you feel is wrong in the world. Not because you're obligated to do it, as the author explains in Part 2 but because you care about it. One is to be free from the burden of 'should' when doing work or making an effort because it must be the right thing to do then and there.</p><h2><i><strong>On to Part 3...<img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669330915/mirroredImages/inixkyTuC6fzXDp2B/miesto1zwfhdjkyxhtui.jpg\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/187dc47e9fe89d55f07af1a95aa61ca9e58ebe02770a4f78.jpg/w_130 130w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/187dc47e9fe89d55f07af1a95aa61ca9e58ebe02770a4f78.jpg/w_260 260w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/187dc47e9fe89d55f07af1a95aa61ca9e58ebe02770a4f78.jpg/w_390 390w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/187dc47e9fe89d55f07af1a95aa61ca9e58ebe02770a4f78.jpg/w_520 520w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/187dc47e9fe89d55f07af1a95aa61ca9e58ebe02770a4f78.jpg/w_650 650w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/187dc47e9fe89d55f07af1a95aa61ca9e58ebe02770a4f78.jpg/w_780 780w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/187dc47e9fe89d55f07af1a95aa61ca9e58ebe02770a4f78.jpg/w_910 910w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/187dc47e9fe89d55f07af1a95aa61ca9e58ebe02770a4f78.jpg/w_1040 1040w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/187dc47e9fe89d55f07af1a95aa61ca9e58ebe02770a4f78.jpg/w_1170 1170w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/187dc47e9fe89d55f07af1a95aa61ca9e58ebe02770a4f78.jpg/w_1280 1280w\"></strong></i></h2><h3><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/grfDjRpWr2xjtLBvi/working-yourself-ragged-is-not-a-virtue\">Working yourself ragged is not a virtue</a></h3><p>Often, in the attempt to push past our limits, we forget that we are still mere monkeys who can use a bit more of our brains that the rest. Not Gods, although we try every day to reach that level. Rather than pushing our bodies and minds as hard as they can get, we must take a moment, look at ourselves and focus on improving our productivity irrespective of the task at hand. Effort is important, as much for achieving than for avoiding failures in the way of the final result.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Kdgpm7t9gZvWncZqa/rest-in-motion\">Rest in motion</a></h3><p>The state of rest is always not the stable one. More often than not, it's the turbulence that provides comfort. Just the like world we live in, our active self will always be in motion and in that state of motion we must find a steady stream of minimum damage. That would be the optimum ground state.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CAWHpzaZGJZMhK6pb/shifting-guilt\">Shifting guilt</a></h3><p>The property of guilt often comes with the powers of inevitability and indestructibility. Shifting the guilt is the foremost approach for which Nate suggests three tools:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><i>Refinement - </i>asking the guilt itself what you did wrong and what exactly was the right thing to do. This works particularly on the listless guilt. Boiling down to the specificity, the guilt becomes more lucid.</li><li><i>Internalization </i>- Refusing to follow your guilt if it was placed on you from the outside. Dropping the obligatory parameters altogether, as suggested in Part 2.</li><li><i>Realism </i>- Trying to materialise the real-world needs that the guilt is demanding and asking how feasible it is to actualise them.</li></ul><h3><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sG4paay6CeGbyYZZo/don-t-steer-with-guilt\">Don't steer with guilt</a></h3><p>Nate makes it clear here that guilt works the same way as internal threats to ourselves. To do something because of the guilt we feel is failing its existence in the first place. Rather than going along with the guilt, we can analyse the separate failures of the past and use the results to update our work.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uGsALatTCgkkqijaw/update-from-the-suckerpunch\">Update from the suckerpunch</a></h3><p>Sucker-punch is what we get in our gut immediately after we realise the feeling of guilt of an event. We only get that hit once(maybe twice) but the lingering feeling attached to it is a construct we create for ourselves. We can counter-use that punch too for getting rid of dependence on guilt for motivation.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KGoNQZAnmfd4oDtfY/be-a-new-homunculus\">Be a new homunculus</a></h3><p>A homunculus is a very small imaginary human or humanoid creature that hypothetically exists in our brain along with similar others. When feeling guilty, we can shift gears and let different homunculus handle the guilt caused by its predecessor. This thought experiment allows us to rectify the guilt from an objective viewpoint and can very effectively dismiss the guilt.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZegT37QwLLRACtZjy/not-yet-gods\">Not yet gods</a></h3><p>Nate explains in this part why we berate ourselves whenever we feel incapable of understanding the choices we made, the mistakes that could have been avoided. We often fail to understand how broken our '<i>coulds</i>' can be and often assume that we possess this godly power to control our brain functions according to our will. What we should realise is that we can retrain ourselves according to our will and keep trying.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/DwApBCz7LnB28mqrM/where-coulds-go\">Where coulds go</a></h3><p>In continuation with the prior, the author explains here how we can actually optimise our choice before, during and after we make them instead of being succumbed to the choice of failure. We can be actively in sync with our mind's direction and coordinate with it while taking up the challenges we bound ourselves to follow. We don't necessarily need to set deadlines for tasks we don't intend to honour in the first place.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/euPT8ddxxpDpKZmmS/self-compassion\">Self compassion</a></h3><p>We get two tools here to close the gap between compassion and self-compassion- First is to understand not to pity ourselves or make excuses for our wrongs in our own minds to get away with guilt. Even when we identify our failings, we can accept them and feel compassion for ourselves. The other tool that Nate recommends is to remind ourselves of our own identity at times. What we do and how we do it makes a lot of difference in our own image to ourselves.&nbsp;</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2agT7asiBZJqfqKgH/there-are-no-bad-people\">There are no \"bad people\"</a></h3><p>The topmost quote of this post is taken from this part. There are no '<i>fundamentally</i>' bad type of people and doing something or failing to do something doesn't make us bad. In the very end, we are not going to end up being either good or bad and reality is not dependent on that either.

That leaves $300 million in funding gaps unfilled. By donating this year, <strong>you can help us not only meet but exceed our goal\u2014and say yes to more excellent opportunities to save and improve lives</strong>.</p>\n<p>Additionally, our giving guidance for donors has changed this year. <strong>For the first time, our top recommendation is to give to our new <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/all-grants\">All Grants Fund</a>, which we allocate to any need that meets our <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models#grantmaking\">cost-effectiveness bar</a>.</strong> We think it's the best bet for donors who want to support the most promising opportunities we've found to help people, regardless of program or location.

See \"Our giving funds, and our top recommendation\" for more on all three of our giving funds.</p>\n<h3>Why your support is so important</h3>\n<p>We rely heavily on numbers to think through our funding decisions. But it\u2019s important to remind ourselves what those numbers represent.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-1\" id=\"fnref-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-1\">[1]</a></sup> If we reach our goal of $600 million this year, we speculatively guess that that funding would save around <strong>70,000</strong> lives.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-2\" id=\"fnref-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-2\">[2]</a></sup> That's approximately the population of Portland, Maine.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-3\" id=\"fnref-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-3\">[3]</a></sup></p>\n<p>To make the image a little more specific: we also expect most of the lives saved will be those of very young children, under five years old.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-4\" id=\"fnref-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-4\">[4]</a></sup> If they reach their fifth birthday, they'll have a much higher chance of surviving into adulthood.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-5\" id=\"fnref-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-5\">[5]</a></sup> We think about 49,000 of the lives these donations are expected to save will be those of children under five<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-6\" id=\"fnref-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-6\">[6]</a></sup>\u2014enough to fill more than 2,000 average US primary school classrooms.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-7\" id=\"fnref-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-7\">[7]</a></sup></p>\n<p>But raising $600 million is not a given. We expect $350 million of our funding this year to come from Open Philanthropy, our single largest donor.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-8\" id=\"fnref-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-8\">[8]</a></sup> The rest will come from our broader community of supporters (like you!), and our projections for this category of our fundraising are fairly uncertain.</p>\n<h4>What $600 million will enable</h4>\n<p>Last year, our research team had tremendous success in identifying new room for more funding,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-9\" id=\"fnref-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-9\">[9]</a></sup> and those efforts have continued to bear fruit in 2022. We've found highly cost-effective funding opportunities in both the interventions implemented by our <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">top charities</a>\u2014malaria prevention, incentives for vaccination, and vitamin A supplementation (VAS)\u2014and newer-to-us areas, such as <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/water-quality-interventions\">water treatment</a>, <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/iron-fortification\">iron fortification</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/syphilis-screening-and-treatment-during-pregnancy\">maternal syphilis screening and treatment</a>.</p>\n<p>Below are just a few examples of what the money we raise this year will likely fund:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>$30.2 million to <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/new-incentives\">New Incentives</a> for continued expansion of its <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/new-incentives\">program</a>. New Incentives, a top charity since 2020, provides cash transfers to incentivize caregivers in northern Nigeria to get their infants vaccinated. Funding from GiveWell and others has enabled the program to grow rapidly over the past couple of years.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-10\" id=\"fnref-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-10\">[10]</a></sup> Prior to this grant, New Incentives had raised funding to reach approximately 3.2 million children across northern Nigeria; we estimate that this grant will allow it to reach approximately 1.4 million additional children.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-11\" id=\"fnref-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-11\">[11]</a></sup></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>$2.4 million to r.i.c.e., a nonprofit that has partnered with the government of Uttar Pradesh, India, to continue operating the Project on Breastfeeding and Newborn Care. The project focuses on <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/kangaroo-mother-care\">kangaroo mother care (KMC),</a> and r.i.c.e. is exploring potential avenues to expand its scale. KMC supports caregivers to adopt best practices for low-birthweight infants, including skin-to-skin contact and early initiation of breastfeeding.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-12\" id=\"fnref-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-12\">[12]</a></sup> Our best guess is that KMC reduces neonatal mortality in low-birthweight infants by 27% compared with conventional neonatal intensive care. We think the effect might be larger for low-birthweight infants who aren't getting other targeted care, such as those in the hospital where r.i.c.e. works.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-13\" id=\"fnref-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-13\">[13]</a></sup></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>$6.2 million to PATH to conduct a pilot of perennial malaria chemoprevention (PMC), formerly called <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/IPTi\">intermittent preventive treatment in infants for malaria</a>, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). PMC provides antimalarial drugs to infants at routine vaccination visits to protect them from malaria.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-14\" id=\"fnref-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-14\">[14]</a></sup> We believe <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2022/01/31/ipti-for-malaria/\">PMC is potentially a very cost-effective way to prevent malaria deaths</a>, but it isn't yet widely implemented.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-15\" id=\"fnref-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-15\">[15]</a></sup> This grant for implementation research could help demonstrate feasibility and open up the possibility for PMC to be brought to scale in DRC, by GiveWell or another funder.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Around $40 million to Malaria Consortium for its <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/malaria-consortium\">seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) program</a> in Nigeria. SMC involves distributing preventive antimalarial drugs during peak malaria season to children living in places where malaria is highly seasonal.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-16\" id=\"fnref-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-16\">[16]</a></sup> This grant will enable Malaria Consortium to continue delivering SMC to children in Nigerian states that have a high malaria burden, but no other large, dedicated sources of SMC funding.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>What we could do with more</h4>\n<p>We're thrilled about the expected impact of the above grants, all of which we estimate are above our bar of <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models#grantmaking\">10 times as cost-effective as cash transfers</a>. But if our donor community gives beyond our goal, we'd have no shortage of funding gaps to fill with those donations, too.</p>\n<p>We've identified another <strong>$300 million</strong> in cost-effective opportunities (at least 6 times as cost-effective as cash transfers) that we'd be excited to consider funding. Programs in this category include Evidence Action's <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/water-quality-interventions#In-line_chlorination\">in-line chlorination program</a> in Kenya, Nutrition International's support for vitamin A supplementation (VAS) in Angola, and Malaria Consortium's SMC program in countries that haven't yet delivered SMC at large scale. We very roughly estimate that funding this additional work could result in <strong>more than 30,000 additional lives saved.</strong><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-17\" id=\"fnref-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-17\">[17]</a></sup></p>\n<h3>Our giving funds, and our top recommendation</h3>\n<p>GiveWell has three distinct <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/our-giving-funds\">giving funds</a>. Which fund you choose to support depends largely on how much you value confidence and established track record in a program, and how much you trust GiveWell to direct funding where it's most needed.</p>\n<h4>All Grants Fund (top recommendation)</h4>\n<p>Our <strong><a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/our-giving-funds#All_Grants_Fund\">All Grants Fund</a></strong>, which is allocated to any grant that meets our <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models#grantmaking\">cost-effectiveness bar</a>, is our top recommendation for most donors. It allows donors to contribute to the most impactful grant opportunities we've identified, regardless of program or location. Supporting the All Grants Fund is an especially good fit for donors who have a high level of trust in GiveWell and are open to some calculated risk, but also want their donation to support programs (as opposed to GiveWell's operations). You can find examples of the types of grants that could be funded by the All Grants Fund <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/all-grants#What_types_of_organizations_does_GiveWell_grant_to\">here</a>.</p>\n<h4>Other options</h4>\n<h5>Top Charities Fund</h5>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/top-charities-fund\">Top Charities Fund</a> is allocated to the highest-priority funding gaps among our top charities only. It's a good fit for donors who trust GiveWell's approach to identifying excellent programs, but want to restrict their gifts to those that warrant our highest degree of confidence, in accordance with our <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/criteria#Additional_Criteria_for_Top_Charities\">top charity criteria</a>. Our current top charities are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/amf\">Against Malaria Foundation</a>, which supports campaigns to distribute long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs) to protect against malaria</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/helen-keller-international\">Helen Keller International's vitamin A supplementation (VAS) program</a>, which provides VAS to children under five to reduce their risk of infection and death</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/malaria-consortium\">Malaria Consortium's seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) program</a>, which provides antimalarial drugs to children under five</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/new-incentives\">New Incentives</a>, which provides conditional cash transfers to caregivers who get their children vaccinated</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Unrestricted Fund</h5>\n<p>Our <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/unrestricted-fund\">Unrestricted Fund</a> can be spent on any GiveWell priority, including our own operating expenses (such as staff salaries, website maintenance, and other routine costs).</p>\n<p>If we raise more funding than we need for our operating costs, we will grant out the excess. Because of this, donors needn't worry that GiveWell's operating budget will ever be overfunded.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-18\" id=\"fnref-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-18\">[18]</a></sup></p>\n<p>The Unrestricted Fund is the best fit for a donor who's excited about GiveWell's work and wants to fund the activities, such as research, recruitment, and fundraising, that fuel our success.</p>\n<p>You can learn more about all of our giving funds <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/our-giving-funds\">here</a>.

We expect that funding directed by GiveWell from our inception to the end of 2022 will save <strong>at least 200,000 lives,</strong><sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-19\" id=\"fnref-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-19\">[19]</a></sup> an achievement we can all be incredibly proud of. Still, the very cost-effective funding gaps we're likely to leave unfilled this year illustrate that a significant need remains.</p>\n<p>If you're an impact-focused donor, we ask that you <a href=\"https://secure.givewell.org/\">give what you can</a> this year to help reduce the gap\u2014with the knowledge that you'll be contributing toward exceptionally cost-effective work. We're grateful for your support of effective programs!</p>\n<h2>Notes</h2>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>The estimates in this section are extremely rough and shouldn't be taken to represent our literal expectations. We provide them to give an illustration of the approximate scale of the impact we think this funding will have in the world. Where possible, we've given conservative estimates. <a href=\"#fnref-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><ul>\n<li>We roughly estimate that about $350 million of that $600 million total would go toward programs whose primary benefit is saving lives. We've calculated this estimate by summing up the <a href=\"https://conceptually.org/concepts/expected-value\">expected value</a> of very cost-effective life-saving grant opportunities (total amount in dollars represented by the grant, multiplied by the percent likelihood of recommending the grant) that we've identified this year, across both our top charities and other programs. These numbers aren't public yet because many of the grant investigations are still ongoing. The likelihood of our recommending a grant that we're still investigating, as well as the total amount of the grant in some cases, is often very uncertain.</li>\n<li>We're using an extremely rough estimate of $5,000 to save a life on average. $5,000 is our rounded average cost per life saved for 2021 grants to top charities; see source spreadsheet calculations <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1z065ab9PPMu9i5KiQ4yLyQJPFQCfEzHSgtHulPiZeBo/edit#gid=1407352843&amp;range=C15\">here</a>. This average is calculated using the subset of grants to top charities that were funded by Top Charities Fund donations, Open Philanthropy, GiveWell unrestricted funding that our board approved for regranting, or other organizations that accept donations on our behalf (e.g., effective altruism groups outside the U.S.). It doesn't include donations made directly to our top charities based on our recommendation, or donations we accepted on behalf of and regranted to individual top charities. GiveWell also directed other grants to life-saving programs outside our top charities in 2021; the cost per life saved for these grants is not factored into the $5,000 estimate.</li>\n<li>$350,000,000/$5,000 = 70,000.</li>\n</ul>\n <a href=\"#fnref-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></li>\n<li id=\"fn-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-3\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Estimated population on July 1, 2021: 68,313. <a href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/portlandcitymaine\">US Census, \"QuickFacts: Portland city, Maine\"</a> <a href=\"#fnref-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-4\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Three out of four of our top charities\u2014<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/malaria-consortium#WhatDoesMCDo\">Malaria Consortium's SMC program</a>, <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/new-incentives#What_do_they_do\">New Incentives</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/helen-keller-international#What_do_they_do\">Helen Keller International's VAS program</a>\u2014directly target children under five. <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/amf#What_do_they_do\">Against Malaria Foundation</a> supports distribution of insecticide-treated nets to households to prevent malaria, without specifically targeting children; however, because <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/malaria-deaths-by-age\">malaria deaths are concentrated in children under five</a>, the largest benefit we <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1tytvmV_32H8XGGRJlUzRDTKTHrdevPIYmb_uc6aLeas/edit#gid=1364064522&amp;range=A62:I62\">model</a> from AMF's program is a reduction in under-five mortality.

We estimate lives saved via GiveWell-directed donations to these four programs in 2021 alone at around 57,000 lives. Naively assuming that we'll direct an equivalent or greater amount of donations to these programs in 2022, we believe that sometime this year we'll have influenced enough funding to eventually save 200,000 lives. (Our rough guess is that funding we direct in 2022, to both top charities and other programs, will actually result in more than 57,000 lives saved; see the \"Why your support is so important\" section of the blog post.) <a href=\"#fnref-LpprvSo9oPk6EE7QW-19\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n", "user": {"username": "GiveWell"}}, {"_id": "ro4sa5B3Hja7C9Ycn", "title": "The Geometric Expectation", "postedAt": "2022-11-23T18:05:12.295Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "Scott Garrabrant"}}, {"_id": "S7dFNoANEQGw83jCk", "title": "\"Far Coordination\"", "postedAt": "2022-11-23T17:14:41.844Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "Dragon God"}}, {"_id": "ngPx7zSku2JbQXmJ6", "title": "10 essential questions a 20y-old should focus on", "postedAt": "2022-11-24T08:56:11.721Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Being a 20y-old, what are the \"10 essential questions\" I should focus on in this decade of my life?</p>", "user": {"username": "el_duderino"}}, {"_id": "CCXSdmkPvrLQZgyCk", "title": "Announcing AI safety Mentors and Mentees", "postedAt": "2022-11-23T15:21:13.423Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "mariushobbhahn"}}, {"_id": "uY5SwjHTXgTaWC85f", "title": "Don\u2019t just give well, give WELLBYs: \nHLI\u2019s 2022 charity recommendation", "postedAt": "2022-11-24T09:56:07.682Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This post sets out the Happier Lives Institute\u2019s charity recommendation for 2022, how we got here, and what\u2019s next. We provide a summary first, followed by a more detailed version.</p><h1>Summary</h1><ul><li>HLI\u2019s charity recommendation for 2022 is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://strongminds.org/\"><strong><u>StrongMinds</u></strong></a>, a non-profit that provides group psychotherapy for women in Uganda and Zambia who are struggling with depression.</li><li>We compared StrongMinds to three interventions that have been recommended by GiveWell as being amongst the most cost-effective in the world: cash transfers, deworming pills, and anti-malarial bednets. We find that StrongMinds is more cost-effective (in almost all cases).</li><li>HLI is pioneering a new and improved approach to evaluating charities. We focus directly on what&nbsp;<i>really</i> matters, how much they improve people\u2019s happiness, rather than on health or wealth. We measure effectiveness in WELLBYs (wellbeing-adjusted life years).</li><li>We estimate that StrongMinds is ~10x more cost-effective than GiveDirectly, which provides cash transfers. StrongMinds\u2019 8-10 week programme of group interpersonal therapy has a slightly larger effect than a $1,000 cash transfer but costs only $170 per person to deliver.&nbsp;</li><li>For deworming, our <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xQk4g7yDvufXiECyc/a-can-of-worms-non-significant-effect-of-deworming-on\">analysis</a> finds it has a small but statistically non-significant effect on happiness. Even if we assume this effect is true, deworming is still half as cost-effective as StrongMinds.</li><li>In our new report,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/the-elephant-in-the-bednet/\"><i><u>The Elephant in the Bednet</u></i></a>, we show that the relative value of life-extending and life-improving interventions depends very heavily on the philosophical assumptions you make. This issue is usually glossed over and there is no simple answer.&nbsp;</li><li>We conclude that the Against Malaria Foundation is less cost-effective than StrongMinds under almost all assumptions. We expect this conclusion will similarly apply to the other life-extending charities recommended by GiveWell.</li><li>HLI\u2019s original mission, when we started three years ago, was to take what appeared to be the world\u2019s top charities - the ones GiveWell recommended - reevaluate them in terms of subjective wellbeing, and then try to find something better. We believe we\u2019ve now accomplished that mission: treating depression at scale allows you to do even more good with your money.&nbsp;</li><li>We\u2019re now moving to \u2018Phase 2\u2019, analysing a wider range of interventions and charities in WELLBYs to find even better opportunities for donors.&nbsp;</li><li>StrongMinds aims to raise $20 million over the next two years and there\u2019s over $800,000 of matching funds available for StrongMinds this giving season.</li></ul><h1>Why does HLI exist?</h1><p>The Happier Lives Institute advises donors how to maximise the impact of their donations. Our distinctive approach is to focus directly on what&nbsp;<i>really&nbsp;</i>matters to people, improving their subjective wellbeing, how they feel&nbsp;<i>during</i> and&nbsp;<i>about</i> their lives. The idea that we should take happiness seriously is simple:</p><ol><li><strong>Happiness matters</strong>. Although it\u2019s common to think about impact in terms of health and wealth, those are just a means, not an end in themselves. What\u2019s really important is that people enjoy their lives and are free from suffering.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>We can measure happiness by asking people how they feel.</strong> Lots of research has shown that subjective wellbeing surveys are scientifically valid (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.oecd.org/wise/oecd-guidelines-on-measuring-subjective-well-being-9789264191655-en.htm\"><u>OECD, 2013</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2210412119\"><u>Kaiser &amp; Oswald, 2022</u></a>). A typical question is, \u201c<i>Overall, how satisfied are you with your life, nowadays?</i>\u201d (0 - not at all satisfied, 10 - completely satisfied).&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Our expectations about happiness are often wrong</strong>. When we try to guess what life would be like, for others or our future selves, we&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/affective-forecasting/\"><u>suffer from biases</u></a>. When we put ourselves in other people\u2019s shoes, we put&nbsp;<i>ourselves&nbsp;</i>in their shoes.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Taking happiness seriously means setting priorities using the evidence on what makes people happier - not just looking at measures of health or wealth and combining that with our guesswork.&nbsp;</p><p>We calculate the cost-effectiveness of charities in terms of WELLBYs (wellbeing-adjusted life years). 1 WELLBY is equivalent to a 1-point increase for 1 year on a 0-10 life satisfaction scale. A 0.5-point increase for 2 years would also be 1 WELLBY, and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>We\u2019re not the first to use this approach (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happinessresearchinstitute.com/waly-report\"><u>HRI, 2020</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/green-book-supplementary-guidance-wellbeing\"><u>UK Treasury, 2022</u></a>). The WELLBY is a natural improvement on the QALY (quality-adjusted life year) metric that\u2019s been used in health policy for three decades (<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioural-public-policy/article/happy-choice-wellbeing-as-the-goal-of-government/ED3A4E384D726238CC2524932F868CBD\"><u>Frijters et al., 2020</u></a>). We are, however, the first to use WELLBYs to work out the best way to spend money to help others, wherever they are in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>We thought the best place to start was by taking the existing charity recommendations made by GiveWell, a leading charity evaluator, assessing their impact in terms of subjective wellbeing, and then looking for something better. We agree with GiveWell\u2019s thinking that your donations will do more good if they\u2019re used to fund interventions that help people living in extreme poverty. We\u2019ve analysed three of those recommended interventions - cash transfers, deworming pills, and anti-malarial bednets - and compared them to treating depression in low-income countries. The whole process has taken three years. We\u2019ve strived to assess the evidence as rigorously as possible and model our uncertainties in line with academic best practice.&nbsp;</p><p>We\u2019re now in a position to confidently recommend StrongMinds as the most effective way we know of to help other people with your money. At the time of writing, StrongMinds is aiming to raise $20 million by 2025 to scale up their services and treat 150,000 people a year.</p><p>We\u2019ll now go through the different analyses we\u2019ve conducted to explain how we got here.</p><h1>Cash transfers&nbsp;</h1><p>A large number of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givedirectly.org/cash-research-explorer/\"><u>academic studies</u></a> show that cash transfers are a very effective way to reduce poverty. The strength of this evidence led GiveWell to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/give-directly\"><u>recommend</u></a> GiveDirectly as one of their top charities (from 2011 to 2022), and treat them as \u2018the bar\u2019 to beat.&nbsp;</p><p>But what impact do cash transfers have on subjective wellbeing? We conducted the first&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/cash-transfers-systematic-review-and-meta-analysis/\"><u>systematic review and meta-analysis</u></a> to investigate this question, bringing together 45 studies. We found that cash transfers have a small, long-lasting, and statistically significant positive effect on subjective wellbeing and mental health. This work was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01252-z\"><u>published</u></a> in&nbsp;<i>Nature Human Behaviour</i> earlier this year.</p><h1>Treating depression</h1><p>But how does alleviating poverty compare to treating depression? I\u2019ve&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/FvbTKrEQWXwN5A6Tb/a-happiness-manifesto-why-and-how-effective-altruism-should\"><u>long suspected</u></a> that, if we focused on wellbeing, we might see that treating depression in low-income countries could be as, or more, cost-effective than providing cash transfers to those in extreme poverty. This was one of the main reasons I founded the Happier Lives Institute.&nbsp;</p><p>So, to enable an \u2018apples-to-apples\u2019 comparison to GiveWell\u2019s recommendations, we needed to identify the most promising charities delivering mental health interventions in low-income countries. After a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/mental-health-programme-evaluation-project/\"><u>rigorous assessment</u></a> of 76 mental health programmes, we identified&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/strongminds-cost-effectiveness-analysis/\"><u>StrongMinds</u></a> as one of the best. It\u2019s a non-profit that provides&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/WHO-MSD-MER-16.4\"><u>group interpersonal therapy</u></a> for women in Uganda and Zambia who are struggling with depression.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/seanmayberry/\"><u>Sean Mayberry</u></a>, Founder and CEO of StrongMinds, is running an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/82heDPsmvhThda3af/ama-sean-mayberry-founder-and-ceo-of-strongminds\"><u>AMA (Ask Me Anything)</u></a> on the Forum this week. If you have any questions about StrongMinds, please take this opportunity to ask him directly.</p><h1>Cash transfers vs treating depression</h1><p>To compare cash transfers to treating depression, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of group or lay-delivered psychotherapy in low-income countries, similar to the one we produced for cash transfers.&nbsp;</p><p>Drawing on evidence from over 80 studies and 140,000 participants, our cost-effectiveness analyses of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/cash-transfers-cost-effectiveness-analysis/\"><u>cash transfers</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/psychotherapy-cost-effectiveness-analysis/\"><u>psychotherapy</u></a> allowed us to make a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/donating-money-buying-happiness/\"><u>direct comparison</u></a> between StrongMinds and GiveDirectly. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the cost-effectiveness of these two interventions has been compared&nbsp;<i>in the same units</i> using measures of subjective wellbeing.&nbsp;</p><p>To be clear, although both interventions are delivered in low-income countries, they are delivered to different groups of people. Only those diagnosed with depression are being treated for depression, whereas cash transfers are distributed to very poor people (only some of whom will be depressed).&nbsp;</p><p>We illustrate the total effect of both interventions in Figure 1. StrongMinds\u2019s group therapy has a similar overall effect to a $1,000 dollar cash transfer: the initial effect is larger, but it fades faster. What drives the difference is that group therapy costs much less ($170 per person).</p><p><i><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Effects over time for GiveDirectly and StrongMinds</i></p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676373467/mirroredImages/uY5SwjHTXgTaWC85f/p0tm7vn1sfmhenfdhbpo.png\"></p><p>A few months later, we&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/happiness-for-the-whole-family/\"><u>updated our analysis</u></a> to include an estimate of the \u2018spillover effects\u2019 on other household members. For cash transfers, we estimate that each household member experiences 86% of the benefit received by the recipient. For psychotherapy, we estimate the spillover ratio to be 53%.</p><p>We also estimated the uncertainty in our model using a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/montecarlosimulation.asp\"><u>Monte Carlo simulation</u></a>, where each dot represents a simulation. This is displayed below in Figure 2.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Figure 2:&nbsp;</strong>Cost-effectiveness of StrongMinds compared to GiveDirectly</i></p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676373467/mirroredImages/uY5SwjHTXgTaWC85f/sd5ndkpbqzdhyyhrh0kp.png\"></p><p>Overall, we estimate that StrongMinds is ~10 times more cost-effective than GiveDirectly. This finding presents a challenge to current thinking about the best ways to improve the lives of others and suggests that treating mental health conditions should be a much higher priority for donors and decision-makers.</p><h1>Deworming</h1><p>From 2011 until a few months ago, GiveWell recommended several deworming charities that treat large numbers of children for intestinal worms. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/deworming#Developmentalimpacts\"><u>case for deworming</u></a> is that it is very cheap (less than $1 per year of treatment per person) and there is suggestive evidence it might have large effects on later income (by improving educational outcomes which enable recipients to earn more in later life).&nbsp;</p><p>GiveWell has claimed that deworming programmes are several times more cost-effective than cash transfers. But how does deworming compare to treating depression, particularly when we look for the effects on happiness, not just income?&nbsp;</p><p>In July 2022, we published a critique of GiveWell\u2019s deworming analysis. In replicating their model, we&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/2022/07/25/deworming-and-decay/\"><u>found an error</u></a> in their calculations of the long-term income effects. With this correction, the total effects would be substantially smaller. In their response,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MKiqGvijAXfcBHCYJ/deworming-and-decay-replicating-givewell-s-cost?commentId=Qt26uR9ZT6ru8xDqi#comments\"><u>GiveWell said</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p><i>Our current best guess is that incorporating decay into our cost-effectiveness estimates would reduce the cost-effectiveness of deworming charities by 10%-30%. This adjustment would have led to $2-$8 million less out of $55 million total to deworming since late 2019\u2026We believe HLI\u2019s feedback is likely to change some of our funding recommendations, at least marginally, and perhaps more importantly improve our decision-making across multiple interventions.</i></p></blockquote><p>GiveWell subsequently launched their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/change-our-mind-contest\"><u>Change Our Mind Contest</u></a> for which they awarded us a prize, retroactively. (Our follow-up entry to that contest suggested a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/qo2QpLXBrrvdqJHXQ/a-dozen-doubts-about-givewell-s-numbers\"><u>dozen other problems</u></a> with GiveWell\u2019s analyses.)</p><p>In August 2022, GiveWell&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2022/08/17/changes-to-top-charity-criteria/\"><u>announced</u></a> they had removed deworming charities from their top charities list. GiveWell now stipulates that their top charities must have \u201ca high likelihood of substantial impact\u201d and the evidence for deworming fails to meet that requirement.</p><p>Our <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xQk4g7yDvufXiECyc/a-can-of-worms-non-significant-effect-of-deworming-on\">analysis</a> finds that deworming has a small, non-significant effect on happiness. Even if we take this non-significant effect at face value, deworming still looks about half as cost-effective as StrongMinds, with wide uncertainty.</p><p>In light of both our analysis and the fact that GiveWell has removed deworming from their list of top charities, we do not recommend any deworming charities over StrongMinds.&nbsp;</p><h1>Life-extending charities</h1><p>To complete our analysis of GiveWell\u2019s top charities, we compared the relative value of life-improving and life-extending interventions. Our new report,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/the-elephant-in-the-bednet/\"><i><u>The Elephant in the Bednet</u></i></a>, explores this topic in detail.&nbsp;</p><p>As the title suggests, this issue is important and unavoidable but it\u2019s a question that people (understandably) find discomforting. The relative value of extending or improving life depends very heavily on your philosophical views about the badness of death and the point at which a person\u2019s wellbeing changes from positive to negative (see Figure 3 below). Although these issues are well-known in academic philosophy, they are almost entirely glossed over by donors and decision-makers.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Figure 3:&nbsp;</strong>Cost-effectiveness of charities under different philosophical assumptions</i></p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1676373467/mirroredImages/uY5SwjHTXgTaWC85f/rx8tkxsrsur7dejwtsfm.png\"></p><p>The insecticide-treated nets distributed by the Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) have been considered a safe bet by the effective altruism community for many years: nets cost around $2 each and it costs, on average, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/cost-to-save-a-life\"><u>few thousand dollars</u></a> to save a life. However, as you can see, the cost-effectiveness of AMF changes dramatically as we shift from one extreme of (reasonable) opinion to the other. In brief, the two crucial philosophical issues are: (a) determining the relative value of deaths at different ages, and (b) locating the neutral point on the wellbeing scale at which life is neither good nor bad for someone.&nbsp;</p><p>At one end, AMF is 1.3x better than StrongMinds. At the other, StrongMinds is 12x better than AMF. Ultimately, AMF is less cost-effective than StrongMinds under almost all assumptions.&nbsp;</p><p>Our general recommendation to donors is StrongMinds. We recognise that some donors will conclude that the Against Malaria Foundation does more good. It is not easy to explain the philosophical issues succinctly here so we advise interested individuals to read the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/the-elephant-in-the-bednet/\"><u>full report</u></a> to inform their decision-making.</p><p>We haven\u2019t analysed them separately, but we expect effectively the same conclusions will apply to GiveWell\u2019s other top charities which are recommended on the basis that they can prevent the deaths of very young children for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/impact-estimates#Impact_metrics_for_grants_to_GiveWell%E2%80%99s_top_charities_in_2021\"><u>between $3,500 and $5,000</u></a>.These are:</p><ul><li>Helen Keller International (supplements to prevent vitamin A deficiency)</li><li>Malaria Consortium (medicine to prevent malaria)</li><li>New Incentives (cash incentives for routine childhood vaccines)</li></ul><h1>Mission accomplished</h1><p>We have now completed Phase 1: we've (re)assessed GiveWell\u2019s top charities using subjective wellbeing and compared their cost-effectiveness in terms of WELLBYs.

Around 82% of the burden is health related, while 18% is economic in nature.</li><li>Neglectedness: The efforts of governments/nonprofits/business in solving the problem are likely&nbsp;<strong>insufficient</strong>, as indicated by low levels of research funding.</li><li>Tractability: A&nbsp;<strong>moderately tractable solution</strong> in the form of direct delivery of masking devices (a form of sound therapy) by collaborating with local primary care physicians is available.</li></ul><p>Discussion</p><ul><li>The estimation of the proportion of tinnitus sufferers who want treatment but currently lack it is highly uncertain, relying as it does on a very simplified model with parameter calibrations that could very well be off.</li><li>The projected growth in the disease burden of tinnitus over time is also very rough, and is certainly something that would be materially improved by expert advice and modelling.</li><li>There is considerable uncertainty over the effectiveness of the specific treatment we evaluate \u2013 masking \u2013 as the evaluation relies on the results of a meta-analysis that examined sound therapy in general rather than masking in particular; we may also be overly optimistic as to the cost of the masking devices used to treat tinnitus.</li><li>On the flipside, we might be understating the effectiveness of this intervention insofar as failure to convince individual physicians to implement the solution simply means freeing up resources to support another persuaded physician. I suspect the main limiting factor in this endeavour will be more the time of the charity co-founders and employees, especially in a context where they may have to travel to various rural clinics to truly reach the unserved.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong><u>Expected Benefit: Improved Health from Treating Tinnitus</u></strong></h1><p>The primary expected benefit from treating tinnitus is improved health, in terms of less disability and suffering. This benefit is around&nbsp;<strong>2.6 * 10<sup>8</sup> DALYs</strong>, and is modelled in the following way.</p><p><strong><u>Moral Weights</u></strong>: The value of averting one year of tinnitus (i.e. the disability weight of tinnitus) is calculated by taking the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ghdx.healthdata.org/record/ihme-data/gbd-2019-disability-weights\"><u>various disability weights</u></a> for various degrees of hearing loss (mild, moderate, moderately severe, severe, profound and complete) with ringing, and subtracting the various degrees of hearing loss (mild, moderate, moderately severe, severe, profound and complete) without ringing, and then averaging. This yields a disability weight of tinnitus \u2013 specifically, the condition of hearing ringing noises in your ear even when no external cause is evident \u2013 of&nbsp;<strong>0.07</strong>.</p><p><strong><u>Scale</u></strong>: In terms of the proportion of the population affected by tinnitus in the baseline year of 2023 \u2013 per the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35939312/\"><u>Jarach et al meta-analysis</u></a>, the pooled prevalence of any tinnitus amongst adults is 14.4% while the pooled prevalence of any tinnitus among children and adolescents is 13.6%. To calculate aggregate pooled prevalence, I take a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/Population/\"><u>population-weighted</u></a> average of the adult and non-adult prevalence rates. However, (a) for the non-adult rate, I weigh the estimated headline rate of 13.6% against the young adult rate (9.7%) insofar as the data on children and adolescents is less reliable (e.g. children are more frequently asked about tinnitus without specifically mentioning the name of the symptom, and children may report the presence of noise to please the interviewers). Besides, there is reason to doubt that young children have higher prevalence rates of tinnitus than young adults anyway, given the otherwise strong empirical relationship between increasing age and tinnitus (not to mention the strong theoretical relationship between increasing age and increasing damage to the ear and hence hearing impairment. I use equal weightage in the weighing to balance in-sample data unreliability on the one hand and external validity on the other. Meanwhile, (b) I weigh the overall aggregate pooled prevalence against chronic tinnitus prevalence rates given the presence of publication bias in the former and the latter providing a more conservative estimate, weighing towards the any-tinnitus estimate, since it suffers from just publication bias, while the chronic tinnitus estimate is both for a narrower definition and from a much smaller sample size. All this yields a prevalence rate of around 13%.</p><p>At the same time,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/CSV/\"><u>global population in 2023</u></a> is expected to be 8,045,311,448.</p><p>Multiplying the prevalence rate and population, this yields a total number of tinnitus sufferers in 2023 of 1,064,041,781.</p><p>Of course, not everyone in this population wants treatment, or (if they want it), isn't already getting it. To calculate this proportion of tinnitus sufferers who want treatment but lack it, I model people getting treatment for tinnitus as a function of tinnitus sufferers wanting to do what's best for themselves (e.g. treatment is beneficial in treating their tinnitus, but they may also be worried about the perceived costs like the inconvenience of sound therapy, the side effects of drugs, or being discomfited by CBT), subject to affordability constraints. In high income countries, around 54.67% of tinnitus sufferers get treated (n.b. this is calibrated using three studies, of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aaaceus.com/courses/NL0313a/A4-Tinnitus%20-%20prevalence%20and%20treatment.pdf\"><u>US</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-018-2914-3\"><u>UK</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/coa.12232\"><u>South Korea</u></a>, with the South Korean figure estimated by dividing total treated by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=KR\"><u>estimated</u></a> total prevalence; overall, a weighted average is taken, with the South Korean estimate penalized for relying on a relatively longer and more uncertain chain of logic in arriving at the country-level estimate). Meanwhile,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2214-109X%2819%2930463-2\"><u>health coverage</u></a> in high income countries is around 90%. Together, this suggests that around 60.81% of tinnitus sufferers in high income countries want to get treated (conditional on being able to afford it). The upshot is that the global proportion of tinnitus sufferers who are potentially treatable is simply (a) this proportion in high income countries that is willing to be treated, less their present treatment proportion; and (b) the proportion willing to be treated in LMICs (as given by the high income willing-to-be-treated proportion, assuming similar global rates), less their present treatment proportion (as estimated by multiplying the willing-to-be-treated proportion with their health coverage proportion), (c) averaging the two by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=XD-XO\"><u>weighing for population</u></a> in high income countries vs LMICs.</p><p>Finally, by multiplying the number of tinnitus sufferers by the proportion who want treatment but lack it, we get the critical figure we need of the number of tinnitus sufferers who want treatment but lack it in the baseline year of 2023 \u2013 around&nbsp;<strong>227,747,926</strong> people.</p><p><strong><u>Persistence</u></strong>:&nbsp; The problem of tinnitus is likely to persist, and eliminating it will bring benefits not just for one year but across multiple years. In terms of how this multi-year benefit is to be discounted \u2013</p><p>Firstly, I discount for the probability of our solution (sound therapy, as will be discussed below) not persisting (i.e. the treatment effect being reversed): Assuming an intervention of providing full treatment as soon as possible in a single year to all tinnitus sufferers who want treatment but lack it, the reversal rate is a a function of both the relapse rate as well as the replacement rate (i.e. the population experiencing turnover from some people dying out and others entering into it). For the former, 7.9% of patients who achieve total remission nonetheless&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0079612320300650\"><u>relapse</u></a> over an 18-month period, which yields a 5.27% per annum relapse rate. For the latter, it can be approximated as the inverse of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthdata.org/research-article/global-age-sex-specific-fertility-mortality-healthy-life-expectancy-hale-and\"><u>life expectancy</u></a>. Overall, this gives us a reversal rate of&nbsp;<strong>6.56%</strong> per annum.</p><p>Secondly, I apply a block discount to account for the proportion of disease burden that would be solved by other agents' intervention anyway (i.e. governments, nonprofits, businesses).&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24213768/\"><u>Broadly speaking</u></a>, research into hearing disorders and tinnitus in particular is severely underfunded by government agencies (e.g. the US National Institute of Health, or the European Union's various national funding agencies). Meanwhile, funding by private non-profits (e.g. the American Tinnitus Association, or the Wellcome Trust in London) is comparatively modest, which shows in the small number of studies on tinnitus published. Finally, the pharmaceutical pipeline is scarce \u2013 companies are not spending to develop new treatments because of our still incomplete understanding of tinnitus's pathophysiologic mechanisms. On the basis of all this, I assess that governments/nonprofits/businesses are uninterested in and unlikely to make a push to expand tinnitus treatment to those who need but lack it (especially in LMICs), the way they might do for the likes of AIDS/malaria/COVID. Hence I take the proportion of the remaining tinnitus disease burden that will be counterfactually solved by various agents (excluding the effects from the secular improvement in health systems) to be 0.1%, and the remaining disease burden still requiring treatment to be&nbsp;<strong>99.9%</strong>.</p><p>Thirdly, I take into account how the proportion of the disease burden requiring treatment will evolve over time given structural trends. To model the growth of the disease burden over time, I model total number of tinnitus sufferers as a function of prevalence and population. The former itself is a function of the original baseline, plus growth from age and non-age reasons.</p><ol><li>The per annum growth from age reasons is estimated by using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6750864/\"><u>Stohler et al's</u></a> British data on tinnitus incidence rate by age group to estimate increase in incidence from increase in age, and then multiplying by the year-on-year increase in median age (as given by UN estimates).</li><li>The per annum growth from non-age reasons is calculated by using Stohler et al's British data on growth in age-standardized incident rate. To the extent that cultural trends are relevant (e.g. increasing education levels causing people to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200507143020.htm\"><u>eat more healthily</u></a>/<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/sms.13653\"><u>exercise more</u></a> and hence be less likely to suffer potential&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23827090/\"><u>tinnitus risk factors</u></a> like obesity, smoking and hypertension), this is taken into account of here. Note that the analyses in both (a) and (b) assume that prevalence scales linearly with incidence, which will be the case so long as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sphweb.bumc.bu.edu/otlt/mph-modules/ep/ep713_diseasefrequency/EP713_DiseaseFrequency7.html\"><u>disease duration remains constant</u></a>.</li><li>Finally,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Standard/CSV/\"><u>population growth and eventual decline</u></a> is modelled by pulling from UN estimates.</li><li>Last but not least, economic trends will matter, with greater wealth expanding access to treatment. I model this by using the difference in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S2214-109X%2819%2930463-2\"><u>health coverage</u></a> between high income countries and LMICs, and dividing by the number of years required for the average LMIC to reach current average high income country GDP given existing growth rates, to yield the per annum growth in treatment rates and hence the per annum reduction in the potentially treatable tinnitus population. That said, I cap the age and non-age growth extrapolation to 2100 due to uncertainty over longer term trends; I also freeze population estimates from 2101 onwards, to 2100 levels, since that is where the high-confidence UN estimates end. For reduction in potentially treatable tinnitus population due to economic growth expanding health coverage, I put a floor at \u202d0.06081\u202c given current rich world coverage rates and the proportion of people who want to be treated conditional on being able to afford it.</li></ol><p>The projected growth of the tinnitus disease burden requiring treatment given structural trends is shown in&nbsp;<strong>Diagram 1</strong>. Note that the sharp reversal after mid-century is precisely because of the cap in coverage rates \u2013 you can't expand healthcare forever.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672982616/mirroredImages/NWyictiWv5ik4RATt/qqxkm3y8wtglczokom9q.png\"></p><p><strong>Diagram 1</strong>: Proportion of tinnitus disease burden requiring treatment given structural trends</p><p>Fourthly, I discount for the probability of the world being destroyed anyway (i.e. general existential risk discount). I take into account the probability of total nuclear annihilation, since the benefits of saving people from tinnitus in one year is nullified if they had already died in a previous year. For the exact risk of total nuclear annihilation, I take it to be one magnitude lower than the risk of nuclear war itself, since nuclear war may not kill everyone. For the probability of nuclear war, I use the various estimates on the probability of nuclear war per annum collated by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/KJNrGbt3JWcYeifLk/p/PAYa6on5gJKwAywrF\"><u>Luisa</u></a>, but with accidental nuclear war factored in, and then calculate a weighted average that significantly favours the superforecasters. The reason for this is that (a) the estimate of the probability of intentional nuclear war based on historical frequency is likely biased upwards due to historical use being in a MAD-free context; (b) the probability of accidental nuclear war based on historical close calls is highly uncertain due to the difficulty of translating close calls to actual probabilities of eventual launch; and (c) experts are notoriously bad at long-range forecasts, relative to superforecasters. Meanwhile, I do not take into account other existential risks like supervolcano eruption and asteroid impact, since the chances of those occurring at all is very marginal per&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Feeding-Everyone-Matter-What-Catastrophe/dp/0128044470\"><u>Denkenberger &amp; Pearce</u></a>, let alone the chances of such events killing everyone and not just most people. Overall, therefore, I treat the general existential risk discount to be just the risk of nuclear war but adjusted a magnitude down \u2013 around&nbsp;<strong>0.07%</strong> per annum.</p><p>Fifthly, I apply a broad uncertainty discount of&nbsp;<strong>0.1%</strong> per annum to take into account the fact that there is a non-zero chance that in the future, the benefits or costs do not persist for factors we do not and cannot identify in the present (e.g. actors directing resources to solve the problem when none are currently doing so).</p><p>Overall, by taking the projected growth in disease burden requiring treatment due to structural trends up to 2100, and discounting each year's disease burden by the block discount (i.e. agents counterfactually solving this problem) and the other per annum discounts (i.e. solution reversal discount, existential risk discount, uncertainty discount), the total proportion of the remaining problem that would be counterfactually solved by our intervention can be calculated, and is displayed in&nbsp;<strong>Diagram 2</strong>.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672982616/mirroredImages/NWyictiWv5ik4RATt/xcj58ggesjz1mf6vjelp.png\"></p><p><strong>Diagram 2</strong>: Proportion of remaining problem that would be counterfactually solved by our intervention</p><p><strong><u>Value of Outcome</u></strong>: By summing the discounted per annum relative values for 2023-2100 as shown above, and then using a perpetual value formula for 2101 to infinity, we can estimate the raw perpetual value of improved health from treating tinnitus as&nbsp;<strong>2.6 * 10<sup>8</sup> DALYs</strong>.</p><p><strong><u>Probability of Occurrence</u></strong>: In terms of the probability of tinnitus being an actual problem that harms people \u2013 unlike longtermist problems, there is no uncertainty that this is an actual problem. The scatter of tinnitus prevalence estimates is wide, but most study results have shown rates of between 10% and 15% of the adult population, and it's not as if the problem has been solved since. Hence, the probability that tinnitus is a problem can be trivially assigned a&nbsp;<strong>1</strong>.</p><p><strong><u>Expected Value</u></strong>: In all, the expected value of improved health from treating tinnitus is just&nbsp;<strong>2.6 * 10<sup>8</sup> DALYs</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong><u>Expected Benefit: Increased Economic Output</u></strong></h1><p>Treating tinnitus is also expected to be beneficial in economic terms. This benefit is around&nbsp;<strong>5.91 * 10<sup>7</sup> DALY</strong>, and is incorporated into the model in the following manner.</p><p><strong><u>Moral Weights</u></strong>: I take the value of doubling consumption for one person for one year to be&nbsp;<strong>0.21&nbsp;</strong>DALYs. This is calculated as a function of (a) the value of consumption relative to life from GiveWell's IDinsight survey of the community perspective, as adjusted for social desirability bias, and (b) CEARCH's estimate of the value of a full, healthy life in DALY terms. For more details, refer to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j67pOUpC5vhC1-H516PAj2-4Fvm5rxJhZNeBVav3kik/edit\"><u>CEARCH's evaluative framework</u></a>.</p><p><strong><u>Scale</u></strong>: At the outset, it will be important to estimate the economic burden of tinnitus relative to annual income per tinnitus sufferer. To do this, I look at three separate estimates. Firstly, I rely on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0194599814566179\"><u>Goldstein et al</u></a> estimate, taking their US data on the direct medical cost per patient and dividing by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=US\"><u>annual income</u></a> to get the economic burden of tinnitus relative to annual income per tinnitus sufferer. Secondly, I look at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23411656/\"><u>Maes et al</u></a> estimate, taking their Dutch data on the total costs in euros (inclusive of direct medical costs, other treatment-related expenditure, as well as productivity loss),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/2548/euro-dollar-exchange-rate-historical-chart\"><u>converting</u></a> it to USD, dividing it by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=NL\"><u>sufferers</u></a> to get the total costs per tinnitus sufferer, and then dividing by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=NL\"><u>annual income</u></a> to get the economic burden of tinnitus relative to annual income per tinnitus sufferer. Thirdly, I consult the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1672293013500079\"><u>Shi &amp; Martin</u></a> estimate, taking their Chinese data on the cost of treatment per person in the form of hearing aids, discounting by the average number of years (i.e.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.oticon.global/hearing-aid-users/support/how-to/treat-with-care\"><u>five</u></a>) that the hearing aids can be used for, and then dividing by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=CN\"><u>annual income</u></a> to get the economic burden of tinnitus relative to annual income per tinnitus sufferer. In calculating the weighted average of these three estimates, I apply the following relative penalties. One, I penalize the Goldstein et al and Shi &amp; Martin estimates for not incorporating other treatment-related costs or productivity costs. Two, I penalize the Goldstein et al and Maes et al estimates for being less relevant to the LMIC context, which we are focusing on given the lower healthcare coverage and higher avertable disease burden. Three, I penalize the Shi &amp; Martin estimate for only looking at one particular form of treatment. Overall, I weigh the Maes et al estimate heavier than the other two in relative terms, and estimate an economic burden of approximately 7% annual income per sufferer per annum due to tinnitus .</p><p>This means a corresponding 7% increase in the degree of consumption doubling per tinnitus sufferer if their tinnitus is cured.</p><p>And hence, we would have&nbsp;<strong>1.68 * 10<sup>7</sup></strong> in total number of consumption doublings achievable by curing tinnitus in the baseline year of 2023,as calculated by multiplying the degree of consumption doubling per tinnitus sufferer if their tinnitus is cured and the total number of sufferers who want treatment but lack it in the baseline year of 2023.</p><p><strong><u>Persistence</u></strong>: With the economic burden proportional to the disease burden, the same per annum discounts, block discount, and projections of the disease burden over time, as discussed in the previous section, are used here as well.</p><p><strong><u>Value of Outcome</u></strong>: Overall, the raw perpetual value of increased economic output is&nbsp;<strong>5.91 * 10<sup>7</sup> DALYs</strong>.</p><p><strong><u>Probability of Occurrence</u></strong>: The same probability as before is applied.</p><p><strong><u>Expected Value</u></strong>: Overall, the expected value of increased economic output is&nbsp;<strong>5.91 * 10<sup>7</sup> DALYs</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong><u>Tractability</u></strong></h1><p>To summarize our tractability findings: we can solve&nbsp;<strong>0.000001</strong> of the problem per additional USD 100,000 spent on direct delivery of sound therapy.</p><p>Direct delivery of sound therapy is the preferred option because it compares favourably relative to the alternative solutions for treating tinnitus. In terms of the effectiveness of various candidate treatments for tinnitus,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8519222/pdf/medi-100-e27509.pdf\"><u>Liu et al's</u></a> network meta-analysis suggests that (a) sound therapy (e.g. masking, habituation) is effective, as are (b) drugs, while (c) education (e.g. counselling) is not, even as certain combinations of the three are effective, more so than individual treatments. In terms of the relative effectiveness of these various treatments and their combinations, we have in declining order:</p><ol><li>Sound therapy with drugs and education</li><li>Sound therapy with education ~ sound therapy with drugs</li><li>Sound therapy</li><li>Drugs</li><li>No treatment.</li></ol><p>Meanwhile, for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23827090/\"><u>other candidate treatments</u></a>:</p><ul><li>Emerging sound treatments lack the support of trial evidence so far</li><li>Alternative medicine may have placebo-induced distress-reduction effects, but there are non-trivial risks (e.g. ear candling causing burns)</li><li>Brain stimulation is backed by some promising evidence so far but the long term risks are unclear</li><li>Laser treatments are ineffective, according to most studies</li><li>As for surgery, Cochlear implantation is very effective but applicable only to a tiny proportion of tinnitus sufferers (i.e. those with profound hearing loss)</li></ul><p>Separately, note that we are constrained by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5398308/\"><u>lack of trained therapists</u></a> in the countries where tinnitus treatment is presumably in the least supply and where the avertable disease burden is highest (i.e. LMICs) \u2013 which makes educational consultation infeasible. In contrast, distributing sound therapy equipment (e.g. maskers) and drugs is fairly straightforward a matter, and is achievable through partnering with primary care physicians.</p><p>Finally, note that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hearusa.com/hearing-aids/tinnitus-hearing-aids/\"><u>sound therapy</u></a> is potentially cheaper than&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.valueinhealthjournal.com/article/S1098-3015(15)04538-6/fulltext\"><u>drugs</u></a>, and more effective besides; given a limited budget, we should therefore focus on sound therapy alone.</p><p>And as for our theory of change:</p><ul><li>Step 1: Persuade primary care physicians in LMICs to accept resources and training for the provision of sound therapy.</li><li>Step 2: The physicians treat tinnitus sufferers who want treatment but currently lack it.</li><li>Step 3: The treated individuals see a reduction in the disease burden suffered.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Step 1: To assess the probability of persuading primary care physicians to accept resources and training for the provision of sound therapy, so that they can actually treat the patients they diagnose, I consult both outside and inside views.</p><p>For the outside view, I consult three reference classes: (1) the general&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Launch-High-Impact-Nonprofit-Joey-Savoie/dp/B09NGTB8YR/\"><u>success rate</u></a> of Charity Entrepreneurship (CE) charities; (2)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3170708/\"><u>physician willingness</u></a> to use sound devices to combat tinnitus; and (3)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bmcmededuc.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12909-015-0460-9\"><u>degree of support for lifelong learning</u></a> amongst rural Chinese physicians (as an indicator of how willing LMIC doctors will be with respect to subjecting themselves to medical training). Unfortunately, all three reference classes have their flaws. Firstly, the CE incubatee reference class is biased downwards insofar as charities can fail for other reasons (e.g. funding) than inability to deliver on their core service. Secondly, the reference class of physician willingness to prescribe sound devices to combat tinnitus is flawed insofar as the prescription rates may well indicate doctors reserving sound therapy for more serious cases of tinnitus and not a general scepticism towards this treatment method. And on top of that, we have to worry about external validity. Thirdly, the lifelong learning reference class suffers from uncertainties inasmuch as positive attitudes to lifelong learning need not translate to actual likelihood of a busy doctor agreeing to and attending more training. And again, external validity worries surface. I penalize the latter two reference classes relative to the first, yielding a weighted aggregate probability of around 44%.</p><p>For the inside view, I reason as such. On the one hand, physicians presumably care about their patients well-being and will welcome any additional resources and ways to treat them for tinnitus. The risk that patients' complaints on the ringing in their heads being dismissed out of hand seems&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2016/01/the-sound-that-comes-from-nowhere/424932/\"><u>low</u></a>, insofar as interest and recognition of tinnitus has improved in the past few decades, partly as a result of advances in neuroscience. On the other hand, it will be a drain on doctors' time to get training for the implementation of sound therapy. On balance, it appears to me that persuading doctors to accept resources and training for the provision of sound therapy is not especially implausible (i.e. &lt;=10%); and something like a 50% chance seems reasonable.</p><p>Overall, while the inside view is subject to a lot of the usual inferential uncertainty, the outside view is particularly flawed in this case \u2013 hence, I give equal weightage out of ignorance more than anything, and estimate a probability of around 47% for persuading primary care physicians to accept resources and training for the provision of sound therapy.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Step 2: As for the proportion of tinnitus sufferers (who want treatment but lack it) ultimately being treated \u2013 this is a function of the number of patients treated, divided by the total number of tinnitus sufferers who want treatment but lack it. Number of patients treated is in turn a function of the budget (normalized at USD 100,000), the proportion of the budget that can be spent on core services, and the per patient cost of treatment. For the proportion of the budget that can be spent on core services, I take the outside view of a weighted average of what&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/amf\"><u>AMF</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/malaria-consortium\"><u>Malaria Consortium</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/new-incentives\"><u>New Incentives</u></a> spend on their core services, penalizing NI for being less procurement-oriented (n.b. I do not use an inside view as I do not believe I have sufficient experience on direct delivery logistics to make an accurate call). The per patient cost of treatment can be calculated by taking the cost of the sound therapy equipment \u2013 a masking device that is basically a white noise generator, and which costs around&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hearusa.com/hearing-aids/tinnitus-hearing-aids/\"><u>USD 25</u></a> \u2013 and multiplying by the number of such devices the average sufferer will need across the course of their life (around 2.7, given that the average sufferer is around&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1808869415313483\"><u>60</u></a>, and the average lifespan is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthdata.org/research-article/global-age-sex-specific-fertility-mortality-healthy-life-expectancy-hale-and\"><u>73.5</u></a> and such hearing devices last around&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.oticon.global/hearing-aid-users/support/how-to/treat-with-care\"><u>5 years</u></a> on average). Overall, the proportion of tinnitus sufferers (who want treatment but lack it) will be approximately 0.000005.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Step 3: Once patients are actually treated, we can expect some degree of disease reduction per patient \u2013 though not a total cure. Sound therapy reduces Tinnitus Handicap Inventory (THI) scores by -30.01 relative to no treatment, and by taking this mean reduction from treatment and divide by the average THI score of sufferers of 54.2, we can calculate the reduction in tinnitus disease burden per sufferer from use of sound therapy as around 55%.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, therefore, the proportion of disease reduction from distributing sound therapy devices \u2013 as a function of (a) the probability of persuading primary care physicians to accept resources and training for the provision of sound therapy; (b) the proportion of tinnitus sufferers who want treatment but lack it ultimately being treated; and (c) the degree of disease reduction achieved per patient \u2013 will be 0.000001.</p><p><br>In terms of costing, we can take the one year operating cost of a direct delivery charity to be a normalized USD 100,000, as it does not matter for the purposes of our calculations; proportion of disease reduction from direct delivery scales with expenditure, and so tractability does not change regardless.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Putting problem reduction fraction and costing together, we see that the proportion of problem solved per additional USD 100,000 spent is&nbsp;<strong>0.000001</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong><u>Marginal Expected Value of Expanding Sound Therapy to Treat Tinnitus</u></strong></h1><p>All in all, the marginal expected value of expanding sound therapy to treat tinnitus is&nbsp;<strong>450 DALYs per USD 100,000 spent</strong>, making this around 70% as cost-effective as a GiveWell top charity.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Joel Tan"}}, {"_id": "CfhMXw4hqtZshTZp3", "title": "What is the best source to explain short AI timelines to a skeptical person?", "postedAt": "2022-11-23T05:20:26.271Z", "htmlBody": "<p>The person in question does not have a ML background.</p>", "user": {"username": "trevorw96"}}, {"_id": "LFNibDPRRmPW6jj9q", "title": "Insurance against FTX clawbacks", "postedAt": "2022-11-23T02:40:36.628Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I've been reviewing funding requests as part of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/L4S2NCysoJxgCBuB6/announcing-nonlinear-emergency-funding\">Nonlinear's effort</a> to help FTXF grantees.

We would seek out individuals with an interest in being data-driven, entrepreneurial, people-focused, passionate, open, and collaborative. Those traits eventually informed the core values of the company culture at StrongMinds.&nbsp;</li><li>StrongMinds has now treated over 160,000 women with depression to date in Uganda and Zambia. On average, 80% of the women we treat remain depression-free six months after the conclusion of therapy. When our clients become depression-free, they can work more, and their kids eat and attend school more regularly. They also report that they no longer feel isolated and have people to turn to for social support. By the end of 2022, we will have treated over 210,000 women and adolescents through our work.</li><li>Drawing on evidence from over 80 academic studies, Happier Lives Institute has found that the group interpersonal therapy provided by StrongMinds is almost ten times more cost-effective than giving cash to people in extreme poverty (a standard benchmark for aid effectiveness).</li><li>I have been honored to present at a few Effective Altruism events. We love that the<br>the community has taken such an interest in StrongMinds\u2019 approach centered around data collection, transparency, cultural competence/appropriateness, and human well-being.</li></ul><p>Please ask me anything!

I have ideas for how to do that.\n<ul>\n<li>But if you just go to EA with an idea like that, one of the main things that happens is \u2026 nothing.\n<ul>\n<li>How do you get attention for a great idea?\n<ul>\n<li>Truth Seeking Processes\n<ul>\n<li>What makes a process truth-seeking?\n<ul>\n<li>True ideas have a large advantage\n<ul>\n<li>Example: rational, productive debate\n<ul>\n<li>You need a process that does critical analysis. And realistically it needs to involve people talking with each other some.\n<ul>\n<li>That basically means critical discussion or debate. People need to think critically about ideas and talk about their criticisms. Then true ideas have a large advantage because they will do better in critical analysis. (That\u2019s not a guarantee, but it sure helps compared to other approaches that don\u2019t significantly advantage true ideas.)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Truth-seeking processes are symmetrical\n<ul>\n<li>That means they work well regardless of which idea or side is correct\n<ul>\n<li>A truth seeking process should get a good outcome, for everyone, if I\u2019m right or if EA is right\n<ul>\n<li>If whoever turns out to be wrong is disliked, mocked, viewed as low status, punished, etc., that\u2019s not truth-seeking\n<ul>\n<li>Being wrong shouldn\u2019t be shameful\n<ul>\n<li>(Bad faith, bad intentions, dishonesty, falsifying data, etc., are different than merely being wrong.)</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>What if my suggestions for EA are incorrect?\n<ul>\n<li>A truth-seeking process should work about equally well whether I\u2019m right or wrong. It should get a good outcome either way. If I\u2019m right, it should have a good chance to figure that out. If instead EA is right, it should have a good chance to figure that out.\n<ul>\n<li>If I\u2019m right, a truth-seeking process should (probably) lead to EA changing, learning, reforming.\n<ul>\n<li>If I\u2019m wrong, a truth-seeking process should lead to me (probably) changing, learning, reforming.\n<ul>\n<li>Whoever is wrong gets the better deal: they get to learn something.

This is all based on the best knowledge anyone has, not omniscience.)\n<ul>\n<li>Ignoring wrong-appearing ideas has two main problems.\n<ul>\n<li>First, you\u2019re fallible. The ideas you ignore might actually be true.\n<ul>\n<li>Second, you\u2019re not giving the mistaken critic any way to change his mind and learn better. An opportunity for progress is lost, and he won\u2019t become your supporter \u2013&nbsp;he\u2019ll instead go around telling people that he criticized your group, and you wouldn\u2019t give any counter-arguments, so you\u2019re clearly irrational and probably wrong.

I don't think people should be put off because it seems hard to get <em>other people/groups</em> to be rational; if they'd actually go first, and get it right themselves, i think that's the key issue. in other words, scaling rational debate from 1 person to 10,000 is hard. scaling from 10,000 to millions is easier. you don't need to worry so much about the mass adoption problem. it's the early adoption problem that's more important. getting to 10k might not even be hard if it got to 100 so there were many positive examples (productive debates) and it was hard to just ignore without engaging.</p>\n<p>BTW does anyone want to debate with me?</p>\n", "user": {"username": "Elliot Temple"}}, {"_id": "hDCK48zFKrHh5YcGN", "title": "How bad is life exactly for animals in factory farms?", "postedAt": "2022-11-23T04:54:26.546Z", "htmlBody": "<p>So I am thinking about factory farming, and especially about the lives of the animals that are getting farmed. I have heard from multiple sources, and I'm guessing you heard it as well, that A LOT of the animals in factory farms are suffering, I believe this to be true, but when I think about it, I am not very certain about it, and I don't really know much details about it either.&nbsp;<br><br>Now I have watched some documentaries about it like \"dominion\" and \"cowspiracy\", that show videos from factories, where the conditions look awful and the animals seem to suffer greatly, and when I see that, I'm pretty convinced that it would be better if those animals on the videos would not be born. What I don't know on the other hand is how representative those videos are, but my guess is actually that they are not very representative. I believe that the creator of the documentaries wants to convey the message that it is horrible for the animals, and because of that, they cherrypick the films from the worst factories and the ones that look most horrible. Then, to get another view on it, I instead go to the webpage of the brand of meat that I usually buy, and they tell me there that all of their animals live a very good life. Now, these two pictures are basically the complete opposite, and I feel like I can't trust either of them.</p><p>So the question I want to be answered is \"What, more exactly, have the animal that I can buy in the supermarket gone through?\", like in what ways did it suffer, if any? This will of course depend on what specific product you buy, but right now I have no idea of any of the meat products I buy. I feel that I can't really make an informed decision of whether or not I should become a vegan without this knowledge, and I'm not sure how to get it. My guess is that they suffer, and they suffer enough to make it motivated to be vegan, but if someone would tell me \"no actually, factory-farmed animals do not suffer!\", then I don't know how to argue against that.<br><br>What are your thoughts? please help me!</p>", "user": {"username": "felixmattsson"}}, {"_id": "KCMFiJbotKANDqqqf", "title": "London EAs in tech: December meetup", "postedAt": "2022-11-22T20:52:45.390Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "Sam Watts"}}, {"_id": "mGbptXsRFrFLfR45J", "title": "A Thanksgiving gratitude exercise for EAs", "postedAt": "2022-11-22T19:32:54.817Z", "htmlBody": "<p>We've all had a rough time lately with the recent FTX crisis, and many of us have probably been feeling anxious, depressed, angry, betrayed, confused, etc., and worried about our funding, our careers, our future, and the future of EA.</p><p>The American Thanksgiving holiday is coming up in a couple of days, which is traditionally a time for reconnecting with family and friends, and focusing on the many things to be thankful for in life.

When it comes to animal welfare, regulatory capture occurs when the interests of the animal agriculture industry is unduly prioritised over meaningful animal welfare standards. This phenomenon often arises when a single government institution (e.g. the country's department for agriculture) is responsible for both promoting the animal agriculture industry and setting the animal welfare standards that regulate that industry.</p><p>The 'gold standard' reform to overcome regulatory capture is to establish an Independent Office of Animal Protection, which is a separate government authority with the responsibility to set animal welfare standards without undue interference. Other smaller, more tractable reforms exist: one example is to move the responsibility for animal welfare out of the agriculture department and into another department; another example is to establish a Commissioner for Animal Protection, which is a more limited government authority with the power to hold accountable the department that does have responsibility for animal welfare.</p><p>In general, campaigning for an Independent Office (or Commissioner) of Animal Protection involves high-level policy reform, so this campaign is more challenging than other campaigns. So, this campaign is an effective choice in a particular country if several key conditions are met:</p><ul><li>The country must have strong institutions, effective democracy, and a concern for animal welfare. These are necessary for an Independent Office to bring about improvements in animal welfare.</li><li>Regulatory capture must exist in that country's animal welfare regime. Regulatory capture is the problem that an Independent Office can help solve.</li><li>That capture must be limiting the progress in the country's animal welfare standards. This would provide the motivation to select this more challenging campaign over other options for campaigns.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We provide some tests that can be used to examine these conditions in a particular country. Lastly, we conclude with some strategy recommendations for campaigning for an Independent Office.</p><h1>BACKGROUND TO REGULATORY CAPTURE</h1><p>Why might animals benefit from an Independent Office for Animal Protection? The motivation lies in the phenomenon known as regulatory capture.</p><p>Essentially, regulatory capture occurs when regulation is co-opted to serve the interests of an industry or another specific group, rather than the public.&nbsp;</p><p>For animals, regulatory capture usually means that animal welfare regulations serve the interests of the farming industry in economic profit and growth rather than the general public's interest in animal welfare.</p><p>In animal welfare regulation, the most common way for regulatory capture to occur is by a conflict of interest. Due to poor institutional design, a government department can experience a conflict of interests between its responsibility to help an industry grow and become more profitable and its responsibility to regulate an industry&nbsp;(1). In animal agriculture, this typically occurs when the responsibility for regulating animal welfare is delegated to the agriculture ministry (or whichever ministry, department or agency that also has the responsibility for the protection, profitability, and growth of the animal agriculture industry).</p><p>Animal welfare regulations can also be captured via cultural capture, where an industry's regulators are influenced through non-conscious, non-material means&nbsp;(1). For example, regulators can identify as part of the same group as industry members, view industry members as high-status, or belong to relationship networks with industry members&nbsp;(2). In animal agriculture, cultural capture could, for example, involve members of regulatory agencies having close connections with farmers or adopting the ideological beliefs, norms, or perspectives of the farming community&nbsp;(1,3).</p><p>There are other mechanisms by which regulatory capture can occur. These are less relevant to animal agriculture, but they may play a role at times. These mechanisms include the limitation of expertise and training to a handful of professional schools or programmes in which the curriculum favours industry interests&nbsp;(4); regulators' material self-interests, including the need for funding, legislative support, or future jobs from the industry&nbsp;(1,2); the possibility that more mature regulatory agencies end up protecting the industry to justify the agency's own existence&nbsp;(1,5); asymmetric information, where the regulator is dependent on the industry for information, expertise, or talent&nbsp;(1,4); industry control over the scientific studies on which regulators depend, which can occur when industry provides funding or proprietary data to academics&nbsp;(6); and threats of legal or political retaliation&nbsp;(7,8). The mechanism that facilitates regulatory capture in a particular context will determine which policy reform is best suited to overcoming capture in that context.</p><h1>INDEPENDENT OFFICE OF ANIMAL PROTECTION</h1><p>By understanding the conditions that facilitate regulatory capture in animal agriculture, it is possible to campaign for policy reforms that can overcome regulatory capture. Every day, well-designed policies and institutions enable government agencies around the world to resist industry pressure and protect the public interest&nbsp;(9). How might the capture of animal welfare regulations be overcome?</p><p>One policy that can help to overcome regulatory capture is the establishment of an Independent Office of Animal Protection. A government could establish such an Independent Office and transfer responsibility for the creation and enforcement of secondary animal welfare regulations away from the agriculture department to that Independent Office&nbsp;(1,3). This would mean that the responsibility to protect animal welfare is separated from the responsibility to protect the interests of the agriculture industry. Thus, the conflict of interest that leads the agriculture department to unduly prioritise profit over animal welfare is averted.</p><p>When it comes to the specifics of what an Independent Office of Animal Protection might look like, we can turn to some well-detailed proposals. Goodfellow's academic work analysed the question of what an Office should look like and gave concrete recommendations&nbsp;(1,3). A 2015 Bill, introduced to Australia's Federal parliament by the Greens party, gives an example of how the legislation creating an Office could be crafted&nbsp;(10). And the Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand proposes, in their animal welfare policy, to establish a Minister for Animal Welfare&nbsp;(11).</p><p>These sources paint a picture of an Independent Office that could:</p><ul><li>Have the status of an independent statutory authority&nbsp;(3,10). This status would enable the Independent Office to preserve its independence, communicate with the public, exist as a permanent agency, develop expertise, ensure sufficient budget resources, and have flexibility in its operations.</li><li>Take over responsibility for the governance of animal welfare from the agriculture department&nbsp;(3,10).</li><li>Review, monitor, and report on standards, laws, and policies relating to animal welfare (10,11).</li><li>Monitor, investigate, and report on animal issues (10,11).</li><li>Implement and enforce animal welfare laws (10,11).</li><li>Have safeguards, including limits on the extent to which ministers could influence the function of the Independent Office (3).</li><li>Be delegated to a ministerial portfolio that is separate to agriculture (3).</li><li>Be established at the level of government that has legal jurisdiction over animal welfare (1). For example, in Australia, the jurisdiction over animal welfare is generally held by the States and Territories, but the Federal government also holds jurisdiction over some specific aspects of animal welfare. In this case, there should be an Independent Office for each State and Territory and one at the Federal level.</li><li>Involve industry in the process of creating and enforcing animal welfare regulations 'subject only to the limits necessary to ensure the entity\u2019s independence' (1).</li></ul><h2><strong>A SMALLER ALTERNATIVE: COMMISSIONER FOR ANIMAL PROTECTION</strong></h2><p>An Independent Office of Animal Protection is the 'gold standard' of animal regulatory reform. However, a full Independent Office may not be tractable in a particular political context.</p><p>One option that may be more tractable is to campaign for a Commissioner for Animal Protection. A Commissioner is like a smaller, more limited version of an Independent Office. Rather than having full jurisdiction over animal welfare regulation, a Commissioner would exist to monitor and audit the performance of the department that <i>does</i> have jurisdiction (1). A Commissioner is a type of proxy advocate - by studying the regulatory process and reporting on shortcomings and improvements, a Commissioner can help overcome biases and inaction in the government's animal welfare regulatory regime, even despite the Commissioner's limited powers (12). This type of entity can also be called an Inspector-General.</p><p>In Malta, there exists a <a href=\"https://agrikoltura.gov.mt/en/commissioneranimalwelfare\"><u>Commissioner for Animal Welfare</u></a>. The Commissioner for Animal Welfare was established by a 2014 amendment to Malta's Animal Welfare Act (13), after campaigning by animal advocacy organisations led to a 2013 election promise by the Labour party (14). The Commissioner has the power to conduct independent investigations into animal welfare regulations, publish reports, and make recommendations to the government (13). The Commissioner also has an educational role that involves promoting public dialogue on animal issues. However, the Commissioner does not have the power to investigate specific instances of cruelty (a responsibility held by other authorities) or enforce recommendations (14). The Commissioner is appointed by the Prime Minister, after consultation with the Minister responsible for veterinary services. Since 2021, the position of Commissioner has been held by Alison Bezzina, a well-known animal rights activist. Bezzina publishes quarterly and annual reports. During 2021, Bezzina's first year as Commissioner, she made 15 recommendations to the government: eight of these related to dog and cat welfare, four to enforcement of animal welfare laws, one to the resources allocated to animal welfare governance, one to animals kept in zoos, and one to wild animals (15). Many of these have been implemented, and some remain under discussion. Bezzina's first year also involved conducting some investigations, mostly into dog welfare, and distributing educational materials to schools and homes. There is notably a focus on companion animals, like dogs and cats, rather than farmed animals. This is because the Commissioner does not investigate instances of cruelty themselves - rather, the Animal Welfare directorate and the Veterinary Services directorate conduct investigations, and if members of the public are dissatisfied, they can ask the Commissioner to investigate the functions of those directorates. Since the public is in greater contact with companion animals, the result is that much of the Commissioner's work relates to companion animals, rather than farmed animals<a href=\"https://www.animalask.org/post/independent-office-of-animal-protection#viewer-2pdv\"><u>\u00b2</u></a> (14).</p><p>Another example of a proxy advocate, albeit with a limited scope, is Australia's <a href=\"http://www.iglae.gov.au/\"><u>Inspector-General of Live Animal Exports</u></a>. This position was established in 2019 following the recommendation of an independent review into the 'regulatory capability and culture of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry' relating to trade and live animal exports. This independent review found that live animal export posed a high risk to animal welfare and that there is an inherent contradiction in the Department's dual role as both a facilitator of trade and a regulator of trade (16). As such, the review recommended that an Inspector-General be established to 'review the performance of functions or exercise of powers by department staff members in the regulation of live animal exports'. The Inspector-General reviews the performance of the Department in regulating exports of live animals. The Inspector-General is following a three-year work plan, which includes reviews into topics including: monitoring and reporting requirements during voyages; processes around granting permits for live exports; supply chain standards; stakeholder engagement and responses to inquiries, complaints, and incidents; improvements in information technology; and implementation of new legislation.</p><p>Notably, the Australian Labor Party announced an Inspector-General of Animal Welfare as an election promise before winning the 2022 Federal election (17). Details of this policy are scarce, but the name suggests that the Inspector-General of Animal Welfare would have the responsibility to review animal welfare policy with a broad scope.</p><h2><strong>WHERE WOULD AN INDEPENDENT OFFICE IMPROVE ANIMAL WELFARE?</strong></h2><p>Now, we turn our attention to the circumstances in which advocating for an Independent Office of Animal Protection would be an effective campaign for animal advocacy organisations.</p><p>We believe that an Independent Office (or Commissioner) of Animal Protection is potentially an effective campaign in a particular country if three criteria are met: the country must meet some specific preconditions, which are listed below; the campaign must be relevant, in that regulatory capture must be a problem in that country; and the campaign must be a higher priority than other campaigns that could be pursued in that country. We will discuss each of these conditions in detail.</p><h2><strong>What are the preconditions to this campaign?</strong></h2><p>For an Independent Office of Animal Protection to function, a country or jurisdiction needs to meet some preconditions:</p><p>Strong institutions. For an Independent Office of Animal Protection to operate, the government must be capable of implementing and enforcing meaningful animal welfare regulations.</p><p>Low levels of corruption. Although an Independent Office of Animal Protection can overcome regulatory capture by resolving the conflict of interest between animal welfare regulation and industry interests, an Office cannot overcome more serious forms of corruption.</p><p>Strong democratic system. An Independent Office of Animal Protection can ensure that the public interest in animal welfare is translated into animal welfare regulations. However, this can only happen in countries where the law reflects the public interest.</p><p>Public concern for animal welfare. For the public interest in animal welfare to be translated into animal welfare regulations, a public interest in animal welfare must exist in the first place.</p><h2><strong>When is this campaign relevant?</strong></h2><p>This campaign is relevant in a country if: 1) that country is facing regulatory capture, and 2) that capture is caused by a single ministry or agency having responsibility for both animal welfare regulation and the interests of the animal agriculture industry, and unduly prioritising the latter. How can we test for the presence of regulatory capture in the animal welfare regime of a country?</p><p>There is a detailed framework written by Goodfellow that can be used to assess evidence on regulatory capture in the animal welfare regime of a particular country or jurisdiction (1,3). However, this framework requires a detailed scholarly analysis, which can be time-consuming. Where a comprehensive, scholarly analysis is not possible, there are some alternative tests that are quicker, although less rigorous:</p><p>You can check to see if animal welfare is the responsibility of the agriculture departments. If so, then regulatory capture is more likely to exist.</p><p>You can examine the process by which animal welfare standards are developed. Is the process transparent? Who funds the process, and who is involved in it? Who funds the science that feeds into the process? If the process is non-transparent and dominated by industry, then regulatory capture is more likely to exist.</p><p>You can examine the primary legislation and the concrete animal welfare codes, standards or regulations to see if there are any major discrepancies. Such discrepancies would indicate that the legislature's intent (which is closely related to the public interest) is not being implemented in practice, which suggests that regulatory capture is more likely to exist.</p><p>You can ask disinterested experts in the country if the government is unduly prioritising the interests of industry over animal welfare. The experts here must be disinterested, as people involved in a policy process may have clouded judgement as to whether regulatory capture exists (18). Researchers are ideal, as long as they do not have strong financial or personal connections to the industry.</p><h2><strong>When is this campaign a high priority?</strong></h2><p>If a country meets the preconditions for an Independent Office to function and it has been shown that animal welfare regulations in that country have been captured, then campaigning for an Independent Office of Animal Welfare would do good. However, it is still possible that other campaigns could do even more good and would thus be an even higher priority.</p><p>When is campaigning for an Independent Office of Animal Welfare a high priority in a particular country? This campaign seeks high-level policy reform, which is one of the most challenging types of campaigns. If advocacy organisations in a particular country have already tried, and failed, to achieve more specific reforms, and if those campaigns repeatedly fail for reasons relating to the governance of the system, then it becomes likely that institutional reform is needed. Likewise, if a country is falling behind in animal welfare standards compared to other countries with similar demographics, then this also suggests that institutional reform is needed.</p><h2><strong>Examples</strong></h2><p>In the following table, we illustrate how the conditions discussed above can be examined in particular countries. We show how, for a given country, it is possible to test whether the country meets the preconditions, whether the animal welfare regulatory regime appears to be captured, and whether campaigning for an Independent Office of Animal Protection is a high priority for that country. We give three examples: Bulgaria does not meet the preconditions; Switzerland meets the preconditions but does not appear to suffer from regulatory capture in its animal welfare regime; and Australia meets the preconditions, does appear to suffer from regulatory capture, and does appear to be a country where this campaign is a high priority.</p><p>Table 1. We use the examples of Australia, Switzerland, and Bulgaria to show how you can analyse whether an Independent Office of Animal Protection would be a high-priority campaign.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\">&nbsp;</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p><strong>Australia</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p><strong>Switzerland</strong></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p><strong>Bulgaria</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\" colspan=\"4\"><p><strong>Does the country meet the preconditions?</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><strong>Strong institutions, according to Government Effectiveness in the Worldwide Governance Indicators&nbsp;</strong>(19)<strong>?&nbsp;</strong></td><td style=\"background-color:#d9ead3;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt\"><p>Yes.

Those conversations revealed a number of strategic considerations when it comes to this campaign:</p><ul><li>The closest example to a successful campaign is in Malta, which has a Commissioner for Animal Welfare. This position arose after campaigns by animal advocacy organisations led to a 2013 election promise by the Labour party to establish a Commissioner&nbsp;(14). This promise was fulfilled, although the role as established was admittedly slightly different to the role that was promised. Nevertheless, this indicates that campaigning for an Independent Office (or Commissioner) is tractable.</li><li>The strategy of the Australian Alliance for Animals is to use three prongs: gathering public support, engaging the government (e.g. attracting the support of MPs with strong policy briefings), and building political pressure to make this policy a priority, particularly during election campaigns.</li><li>Generally, the public is receptive to this campaign. Learning about the contradiction of animal welfare being the responsibility of the agriculture ministry can be a revelation for many people. Awareness and support can be generated through media coverage, particularly when an instance of cruelty is publicised or when a contradictory position by the agriculture minister is exposed. The support of community organisations - particularly organisations that are popular among the public - is also important.</li><li>The details of the campaign and the proposed policy need to be adapted to the political context and political dynamics of a particular country. For example: in New Zealand, a Commissioner appears more politically feasible than an Independent Office because the country has a history of establishing Commissioners in other policy areas; Australia and Canada have federal systems, which affects where responsibility for animal welfare sits and the number of different governments that need to be brought on board with a campaign; and in Australia, the animal agriculture industry has more influence over one major political party (Liberal) than another (Labor), which means that the campaign may have greater success when the latter party is in power.</li><li>Advocates should understand that this campaign is not merely a technical change. Rather, the campaign is fundamentally about power - specifically, who has power over animal welfare standards. The animal agriculture industry can feel threatened by this campaign because it sees the campaign as seeking to take power away from the industry. As such, this campaign will always involve a political battle.</li><li>Ideally, the policy needs to be implemented in a way that will not cause it to be abolished as soon as there is a change in government. Building relationships with politicians from all major political parties could help with this. One strategic choice could also be to accept a compromise proposal, even if that proposal is watered down compared to the 'gold standard'. This would help parties and stakeholders become familiar with the concept and avoid regulatory shocks - then, in the future, the policy could be progressively developed into something more impactful.</li><li>Similarly, when an Independent Office or a Commissioner is established, it must not be subject to regulatory capture itself. This risk can be reduced by ensuring that the legislation protects the independence of the Office and provides sufficient guidance and transparency around the appointment of key personnel. Likewise, a policy that grants the Independent Office or Commissioner concrete powers - rather than acting as a merely consultative role - is, of course, preferable&nbsp;(14).</li><li>The way the policy is implemented can affect the types of policy reforms that the Independent Office or Commissioner can bring about. In Malta, the position of the Commissioner for Animal Welfare is largely designed to respond to specific public concerns about the way cases of cruelty are investigated - since the public is in greater contact with dogs and cats, this means that the Commissioner spends almost all of their time on dogs and cats rather than farmed animals&nbsp;(14). Since farmed animals represent the overwhelming majority of animals (and avoidable suffering) in any given country, implementing the policy in a way that permits a focus on farmed animals would be very beneficial.</li><li>Lastly, it is emphasised that this campaign is likely to be a relatively long battle. High-level policy reform is inherently the most difficult type of campaign. For this reason, it is useful to think long-term and build strong relationships with MPs and political parties.</li></ul><h1>OTHER SOLUTIONS TO REGULATORY CAPTURE</h1><p>Beyond the Independent Office and Commissioner policies, there are other options for policy reform to overcome regulatory capture in a country or jurisdiction's animal welfare regime. These options could also be useful additional policies to complement an Independent Office or Commissioner as part of a larger collection of reforms.</p><p>Responsibility for animal welfare could be moved to a different, existing department to avert the conflict of interest. Although the EU did not establish an Independent Office for Animal Welfare, it did move responsibility for animal welfare from the Directorate-General for Agriculture to the Directorate-General for Health and Consumers&nbsp;(1). Likewise, in Switzerland, responsibility for animal welfare is held by the Federal Food Safety and Veterinary Office, which sits under a department separate to that of the Federal Office for Agriculture.</p><p>Another option is a tripartite programme&nbsp;(1). Tripartite programmes empower non-government organisations that would typically be underrepresented in the regulatory regime. These programmes grant non-government organisations (NGOs) all of the information that is available to the regulator, allow NGOs to have a seat alongside industry and the regulator during negotiations, and grant NGOs the same power to sue as the regulator&nbsp;(1). For a tripartite programme to work, there must be a robust network of existing non-government organisations&nbsp;(6). When compared with a regulatory contrarian, tripartite programmes might be more desirable when there is no single, clear 'public interest' position, or when the threat of political pressure is an important advocacy tactic&nbsp;(6). Goodfellow&nbsp;(1) speculates that advocating for the establishment of a tripartite programme for animal welfare regulation may be too difficult due to the structure and culture of typical agriculture departments.</p><p>There are a handful of other tools that can help overcome regulatory capture. However, these suffer from weaknesses when applied to animal agriculture:</p><ul><li>Judicial review of regulatory decisions through the courts&nbsp;(28). A number of animal advocacy groups exist to fill this function (e.g. Advocates for Animals, Legal Impact for Chickens). However, as a method for addressing regulatory capture, judicial review suffers from some weaknesses: it considers only the tiny proportion of cases that are brought before the court; and it requires the ongoing effort and engagement of animal advocacy organisations, rather than advocating for the government to invest the effort in fixing its own poorly designed institutions.</li><li>A number of other mechanisms that promote greater openness around regulations, including more public input and greater media coverage and journalistic scrutiny&nbsp;(7). These are less relevant for animal agriculture, as regulatory capture often stems from the disproportionate power held by industry voices in negotiation, rather than an absence of public input or media coverage per se. The absence of public input is often a symptom, rather than a cause, of regulatory capture.</li></ul><p>Lastly, policy reforms can be complemented by animal welfare advisory committees. These committees typically consist of representatives from industry, animal advocacy organisations, government departments, veterinarians, and experts from animal science, ethics, and economics. These committees provide scientific evidence and policy advice. Such committees exist in the UK, Canada, New Zealand, the EU, and numerous countries within the EU.</p><h1>CONCLUSION</h1><p>Where a country's animal welfare regulation is subject to capture, one option is to campaign for an Independent Office of Animal Protection. Campaigns that are smaller, but potentially more tractable, include a Commissioner for Animal Protection, or simply moving responsibility for animal welfare to a different government department. These campaigns address the conflict of interest between promoting the animal agriculture industry and setting animal welfare standards. This would mitigate, or possibly even overcome, the effects of regulatory capture, thus improving the outlook for improvements of the country's animal welfare standards in the future.</p><p>This campaign is likely to be effective in countries with strong institutions, with support for animal welfare, and where regulatory capture is limiting the progress in animal welfare standards. However, this campaign will not necessarily be a priority campaign - in a given country, there may be more pressing campaign priorities. We encourage you to examine the context of your own country against the contents of this report, and to get in touch with us at Animal Ask if you would benefit from further assistance in selecting a campaign.</p><h1>APPENDIX: EVIDENCE ON CAPTURE OF ANIMAL WELFARE REGULATIONS</h1><p>When it comes to regulatory capture in animal agriculture, the seminal study is that by Goodfellow&nbsp;(1,3). Goodfellow's study adopts Professor Barry Mitcnick's definition of regulatory capture&nbsp;(29):</p><p><i>\u2018Capture\u2019 is said to occur if the regulated interest controls the regulation and the regulated agency; or if the regulated parties succeed in co-ordinating the regulatory body\u2019s activities with their activities so that their private interest is satisfied; or if the regulated party somehow manages to neutralize or ensure nonperformance (or mediocre performance) by the regulating body; or if [...] the regulated party succeeds (perhaps not even deliberatively) in co-opting the regulators into seeing things from their own perspective and thus giving them the regulation they want; or if, quite independently of the formal or conscious desires of either the regulators or the regulated parties the basic structure of the reward system leads [...] regulators inevitably to a community of interests with the regulated party.</i></p><p>Goodfellow&nbsp;(1,3) proposed a framework that can be used to assess evidence on regulatory capture in the animal welfare regime of a particular country or jurisdiction. Firstly, one must offer and defend a falsifiable model of the public interest. Secondly, one must show that policy has shifted away from the public interest towards the industry interests. Thirdly, one must show a causal relationship between those three indicators and some mechanism of regulatory capture.</p><p>To show that a policy has shifted away from the public interest towards industry interests, Goodfellow gives three indicators of regulatory failings. These indicators provide a benchmark that can be used to test claims that the public interest has been subverted in the context of animal welfare. The indicators of regulatory failings are:</p><ul><li>Inadequate animal welfare standards,</li><li>Prevalence of serious animal welfare incidents in the agricultural sector, and</li><li>The presence of regulatory process deficiencies.</li></ul><p>To illustrate this framework, we will describe how Goodfellow applied it to the context of animal welfare regulations in Australia. As a model of the public interest, Goodfellow</p><p>proposed that, in Australia, there is a public interest in: '(1) protecting farm animals from cruelty; and (2) promoting farm animal welfare through incremental, but sustained, improvements in welfare standards over time'. Goodfellow argues that this two-fold public interest is the purpose of animal welfare legislation throughout the country and also reflects empirical research on public opinion. Goodfellow then showed how the three indicators of regulatory failings are present in Australia:</p><ul><li>Inadequate animal welfare standards were shown in three ways. Public opinion surveys show that majorities of the Australian public believe existing standards to be cruel or below their expectations; developments in other Western, developed countries (the EU, Canada, and the US) show that Australia lags behind these countries in animal welfare standards; and Australian animal welfare standards fail to meet principles established by animal welfare legislation, including the principle of proportionality.</li><li>The prevalence of serious animal welfare incidents in the agricultural sector was demonstrated by listing the numerous incidents revealed by the media, animal advocacy organisations, and the government.</li><li>The presence of regulatory process deficiencies was demonstrated by showing that industry interests dominate the standard setting process; that the industry has a large amount of control over animal welfare science, including the projects conducted, the scientists involved, how the research is conducted, and how the work is reported; and that government inspection regimes have been substituted by industry-run quality assurance schemes.</li></ul><p>As such, Goodfellow concludes that the Australian animal welfare regime 'bear[s] all the hallmarks' of regulatory capture. This framework can be applied in the same way to test for the presence of regulatory capture in any country or jurisdiction.</p><p>Goodfellow&nbsp;(1,3) critically examined claims of regulatory capture in the general governance of animal welfare in Australia. Goodfellow provided an overview of the farm animal welfare regulatory framework in Australia. Then, Goodfellow tested whether the conditions for regulatory capture exist in that framework, using some specific indicators (discussed below). The analysis found that Australia's animal welfare regulatory framework 'bear[s] all the hallmarks of [...] regulatory capture'. The analysis showed that agriculture departments do indeed experience a conflict of interest by which the productivity and profitability of agriculture are unduly prioritised over animal welfare. The analysis also showed that the animal welfare regulatory framework is dominated by institutions with 'one particular set of values towards animals and their place in the world relative to human beings'. Goodfellow identified some specific problems with the animal welfare regulatory framework, including the overrepresentation of industry interests in developing welfare standards; industry influence over animal welfare science; and insufficient monitoring and enforcement.</p><p>A similar analysis by Ong&nbsp;(30) analysed regulatory capture in New Zealand. Ong drew on Goodfellow's indicators of regulatory capture and examined how they apply in New Zealand's animal welfare regime. This analysis found that New Zealand, like Australia, places the interests of the animal agriculture industry over the interests of the general public in protecting animal welfare. Ong argued that this regulatory capture results from the poor institutional design of the Ministry for Primary Industries, which in turn led to the cultural capture of regulators.</p><p>New Zealand's animal welfare regime was also the subject of the case study analysed by Duffield&nbsp;(31). Duffield described how animal advocacy organisations publicised footage from an independent investigation showing the cruelty and suffering experienced by young calves in the dairy industry. The Ministry for Primary Industries responded by quickly creating new regulations on the treatment and welfare of young calves. Duffield argued that the Ministry was motivated to create new regulations to protect New Zealand's reputation among the country's trade partners. However, this instrumental approach was at odds with the non-instrumental public interest in animal welfare, which is enshrined in the country's&nbsp;<i>Animal Welfare Act 1999.</i> As such, Duffield concludes that the Ministry's response was characteristic of regulatory capture.</p><p>Regulatory capture in New Zealand\u2019s animal welfare policy is also the subject of several papers by Morris&nbsp;(32,33). Morris draws on government documents and meeting minutes to describe the disproportionate power of industry groups on animal welfare standards in New Zealand. They argue that the ministry is 'looking after the interests of producers, not animals'. The mechanisms that Morris describes as causing this problem are, using the terminology that we outline above, cultural capture and veiled legal threats. Morris mentions that one solution could be to create a new independent 'Ministry for Animal Welfare'.</p><p>Similarly, Dale and White&nbsp;(34) examine New Zealand's National Animal Welfare Advisory Committee, a quasi-independent body that is responsible for reviewing and providing advice on proposed animal welfare standards. Although this Committee is intended to ensure that the interests of animals and other non-industry interests are heard during the process of setting standards, there remain many claims that the industry nevertheless holds undue power over the process.</p><p>Other studies have provided examples of how the concept of 'capture' by the animal agriculture industry may be imagined more broadly. Carey&nbsp;<i>et al.</i>&nbsp;(35) examine a case study in which the Australian egg industry succeeded in maintaining its preferred, looser definition of 'free range' eggs, despite a consumer campaign seeking a more strict definition. In this sense, the egg industry succeeded in capturing the definition of a labelling term. In another study, Carey&nbsp;<i>et al.</i>&nbsp;(36) showed how the regulatory dynamics in the pig farming industry - including the power of retailers and the need by animal advocates to selectively focus on a single dimension of pig welfare - enabled the industry to co-opt a campaign by animal advocacy organisations against sow stalls. This enabled the 'concept of pig welfare to be corporatized in a way that maintains the dominant model of factory farmed pig meat production'.</p><p>Goodfellow&nbsp;(1) describes how, in the European Union (EU), the responsibility for animal welfare was moved from the Directorate-General for Agriculture to the Directorate-General for Health and Consumers. This separation of powers may help prevent regulatory capture of animal welfare policy at the EU level.</p><p>In North America, conflicts-of-interest and regulatory capture in animal welfare regulation and enforcement have been touched on by a handful of studies&nbsp;(37\u201341). Notably, Bloom&nbsp;(42) describes a legal case in New Jersey,&nbsp;<i>New Jersey Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and ors v. New Jersey Department of Agriculture and ors (Supreme Court of New Jersey, 30 July 2008)</i>. In that case, animal protection organisations challenged the Department of Agriculture's animal welfare regulations. The court found that 'the Department did not simply engage in a subdelegation, but did so in favor of some entities that also might be described as private interests'.</p><h2>NOTES</h2><p>1. This policy is also called an Independent Office of Animal Welfare or simply an independent animal welfare authority. In this report, we use the term Animal Protection because the objective of such an Independent Office could, in principle, establish protections for animals that go beyond their welfare. The specific name is a bit of a distraction - the structure, function, and powers of the body are the important details. We do also refer to the policy using different names when discussing specific examples or proposals.</p><p>2. One could therefore speculate that in Malta (and future jurisdictions with Independent Offices or Commissioners), building public concern for farmed animals could be a useful advocacy strategy.</p><p>3. Goodfellow argues that the scientific experts should be separated from the representatives of industry and animal advocacy organisations. This way, scientific statements can be used as the basis for political debates about values, rather than allowing scientific evidence and values to become conflated.</p><h2><strong>REFERENCES</strong></h2><p>1.

Their purpose is to clarify the intervention\u2019s name. Interventions are not ordered within categories.</p><h2><strong>Whole-institution governance, leadership, and culture</strong></h2><h3><strong>Creating identity&nbsp;cues</strong></h3><p>Subtly reminding&nbsp;people that part of their professional identity is being evidence-informed could increase their evidence uptake (Breckon &amp; Dodson, 2016, p. 8).</p><p>Note that, throughout this post, I will be referring to \u201cevidence\u201d and \u201cincreasing evidence use.\u201d What I mean by evidence is robust, scientific evidence. I.e., the type you would find in a peer-reviewed journal. I acknowledge that this high-quality evidence is not always available, but that is no excuse for lowering our standards of what constitutes good evidence. When being forced to use lower-quality evidence, we should acknowledge that this is due to lack of better alternatives.</p><h3><strong>Amending constitutions, bylaws, or statutes</strong></h3><p>In his 2021 <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Anticipation-Sustainability-Extinction-Routledge-Research/dp/0367767570\"><u>book</u></a>, \u201cAnticipation, Sustainability, Futures and Human Extinction,\u201d Bruce Tonn (also my mentor for this project) dedicates a chapter to creating new institutions and changing existing ones in order to increase foresight, prevent existential risks, and \u201censure humanity\u2019s journey into the distant future.\u201d The chapter includes a study on the future-orientedness of national constitutions, suggestions for new \u201canticipatory institutions,\u201d suggestions for constitutional amendments, and more. This is a great resource to get started and get a first longtermist&nbsp;view of constitutional amendment opportunities. My hope is that the approach Tonn took to studying the future-orientation of constitutions and proposing improvements could be applied to other institutions. Perhaps one can take similar approaches to changing the legal structure of many different forms of institutions, and that is why I included bylaws and statutes in the intervention\u2019s title.&nbsp;</p><p>As Ara\u00fajo &amp; Koessler (<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3933683\">2021</a>) state, 41% of constitutions give (varying levels of) legal protection to future generations.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4s11ltbmytb\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4s11ltbmytb\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Despite that, Tonn (2021) states that, \"of ... 100 reviewed constitutions, only two contained explicit provisions <i>for institutions</i> to advocate for future generations\"; the Hungarian and Tunisian ones (p. 164; emphasis mine).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefg9oiak1blwh\"><sup><a href=\"#fng9oiak1blwh\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Constitutions could thus be amended to establish new institutions, not just protect future generations in the abstract. Example ideas are Tonn\u2019s proposed national anticipatory institutions (NAI), the World Court of Generations (WCG), the InterGenerational Panel on Perpetual Obligations (IPPO), or others. For possible approaches to amending constitutions, see Tonn (2021, p. 165).</p><h3><strong>Capitalizing on \u201cevidence leaders\u201d to increase evidence uptake</strong></h3><p>\u201cEvidence leaders\u201d are likable, influential, and trustworthy individuals who publicly champion evidence use. Giving these individuals the spaces to champion their views, both within the institution and publicly, could be a way of broadly increasing evidence uptake. See <a href=\"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD000125.pub5/full\"><u>this article</u></a>&nbsp;from the healthcare sector.</p><h3><strong>Reviewing evidence: signing up employees to evidence newsletters, reminders of past findings, journal clubs</strong></h3><p>Some interventions in this category: (1) signing up employees to evidence newsletters which list important new findings in their relevant area, (2) having a similar newsletter, which \u201creminds\u201d them about important past findings instead of just new ones, and (3) creating journal clubs in the organization: groups that meet and discuss new journal publications relevant to the organization\u2019s work. This could serve as a motivator to read more relevant research, and would also be a way to slowly build stronger epistemic commons (shared knowledge).</p><h3><strong>Making a research database your employees\u2019 default landing page</strong></h3><p>Making <a href=\"https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/research-databases\"><u>research databases</u></a>&nbsp;employees\u2019 landing pages changes the default option, which leverages their bias toward inaction to increase use of scientific research (Milkman et al., 2009a). As noted by one of the reviewers of this post, this seems like an intervention that could be helpful only in niche roles.</p><h3><strong>Providing internal financial incentives to modify behavior</strong></h3><p>This is a broad category of possible interventions, but is listed here as one because I think that this solution to suboptimal behavior isn\u2019t considered seriously enough. A (somewhat niche) example of this would be offering small prizes or higher bonuses for those who list their <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bbtvDJtb6YwwWtJm7/epistemic-status-an-explainer-and-some-thoughts\"><u>epistemic status</u></a>&nbsp;and use numerical probabilities when writing internal policy recommendations. See <a href=\"https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD009255/full\"><u>this article</u></a>&nbsp;from the health sector exploring this, as cited in Breckon &amp; Dodson (2016).</p><h3><strong>Incentivizing attendance of or hosting knowledge exchange events</strong></h3><p>EA-relevant examples of this are EAG(x) events. Seminars, conferences, workshops, and the like can increase coordination and cooperation between experts and facilitate knowledge exchange. This would also be a great place to give the aforementioned \u201cevidence leaders\u201d a platform. &nbsp;Organizations could host knowledge exchange events, or incentivize attendance at third-party events by promoting such events, covering transportation/accommodation costs, or outright requiring attendance of X number of such events per year.</p><h3><strong>Increasing diversity in institutions</strong></h3><p>Increasing different types of diversity (geographic, ethnic, racial, gender, seniority, etc.) in institutions and teams of workers may increase performance. After a very short amount of time digging into the research, it seems to me like diversity\u2019s effects on performance are not as straightforward as I had previously assumed. See <a href=\"https://elicit.org/search?q%3Ddoes%2Bdiversity%2Bin%2Bteams%2Bincrease%2Bperformance%253F%26token%3D01GH82A7W5TXDT1MWJY4NC1M89\"><u>Elicit</u></a>&nbsp;for a short list of relevant papers. Stauffer, M. has said that \u201cWhile popular, nudges and diversity do not seem to adequately support political decision-making\u201d (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LJ489aTMnEkergoXk/max-stauffer-strategies-to-support-political-decision-making\"><u>link</u></a>). Nevertheless, even if diversity did not directly improve performance in certain areas (which is unclear) an institution might pursue diversity goals for many other reasons, such as increasing the representation of underrepresented groups in public office.</p><h3><strong>Altering incentives for joining organizations</strong></h3><p>This idea comes from a conversation I had with J.T. Stanley at EAGx Boston (2022). His idea was to change the very incentives for people to run for the US Congress or the presidency by establishing Public Office Enrichment Ceilings (POECs), which essentially mean setting a hard limit on how much money and assets these individuals would be allowed to hold. The idea being that setting such a limit might shift the incentives people face when deciding whether to run for public office: those who run for power and more riches quit, while those dedicated to the public good remain. This is a simplification of J.T.'s idea, so if you want to delve deeper into it refer to the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dZm3-Qrw2LaT5HsTo9pKRta1Dqzwniwi/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=111316552491979793650&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true\">following document</a>.</p><p>That is just one way that the incentives for joining organizations could be changed. Open avenues of research would be what other incentive structures could be altered, in which organizations, and whether some such changes have been successful before.</p><h3><strong>Influencing&nbsp;organizational culture through storytelling</strong></h3><p>This idea comes from Superforecasting (Tetlock &amp; Gardner, 2016). In chapter 10, Tetlock &amp; Gardner recount how Helmuth von Moltke, a nineteenth-century Prussian field marshal, was partly responsible for influencing the Prussian army\u2019s culture toward embracing critical and independent thinking by officers on-the-ground. Below is an excerpt from Superforecasting that should help me make my point.</p><blockquote><p>The acceptance of criticism went beyond the classroom, and under extraordinary circumstances more than criticism was tolerated. In 1758, when Prussia\u2019s King Frederick the Great battled Russian forces at Zorndorf, he sent a messenger to the youngest Prussian general, Friedrich Wilhelm von Seydlitz, who commanded a cavalry unit. \u201cAttack,\u201d the messenger said. Seydlitz refused. He felt the time wasn\u2019t right and his forces would be wasted. The messenger left but later returned. Again he told Seydlitz the king wanted him to attack. Again Seydlitz refused. A third time the messenger returned and he warned Seydlitz that if he didn\u2019t attack immediatel the king would have his head. \u201cTell the King that after the battle my head is at his disposal,\u201d Seydlitz responded, \u201cbut meanwhile I will make use of it.\u201d Finally, when Seydlitz judged the time right, he attacked and turned the battle in Prussia\u2019s favor. Frederick the Great congratulated his general and let him keep his head. This story, and others like it, notes Muth, \u201cwere collective cultural knowledge within the Prussian officer corps, recounted and retold countless times in an abundance of variations during official lectures, in the officer\u2019s mess, or in the correspondence between comrades.\u201d The fundamental message: think. If necessary, discuss your orders. Even criticize them. And if you absolutely must\u2014and you better have a good reason\u2014disobey them. (Tetlock &amp; Gardner, 2016)</p></blockquote><p>I hope this clarifies what I mean by this intervention. The inner workings of institutions are deeply shaped by the institutions\u2019 culture, which is in turn shaped by many factors, among them the stories we tell and the \u201ccollective cultural knowledge\u201d that we develop. How exactly to use storytelling to influence organizational culture goes beyond the scope of this article.</p><h3><strong>Core-values change</strong></h3><p>This idea comes from a document from the European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre: \u201cThe principle of informing policy through evidence could be recognised as a key accompaniment to the principles of democracy and the rule of law.\u201d (Mair et al., 2019). Attempting to shift an institution\u2019s core values seems difficult, but potentially high-impact.</p><h3><strong>Decreasing partisanship and polarization (general)</strong></h3><p>Excessive partisanship and polarization seem unconducive to rational discourse and would probably hinder effective deliberation and decision-making. I have not had time to delve into what actual, specific intervention exist that could help counter this issue; I am including this \u201cgeneral\u201d area because I think it would be worthwhile for other researchers to pay more attention to it than I did. The same applies to all other interventions in this article labeled \u201cgeneral.\u201d</p><h3><strong>Altering hiring practices (general)</strong></h3><p>Just as the intervention above: I did not have time to go into this area, but this dimension of whole-institution governance interventions should not be neglected by others.</p><h3><strong>Decreasing corruption (general)</strong></h3><p>Same as above. I was very surprised that I did not come across interventions to decrease corruption in institutions while doing research, and even more surprised in hindsight that I did not go out of my way to look for them. Anecdotally, it seems to me that corruption may be the single biggest problem hindering the effectiveness of many governmental institutions in my home country (Argentina) as well as in many (if not most) other developing countries. Interventions that successfully decrease corruption in institutions, if feasible and cost-effective, could be one of the highest priorities for development-focused IIDM in the future. Therefore, if you are an IIDM-focused researcher, it might be worthwhile to take a much closer look into this general area than I did.</p><h2>Group dynamics in decision-making</h2><h3><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6miasxvmrGZChosBc/list-of-interventions-for-improving-institutional-decision#__Delphi_method_for_aggregating_judgment\"><strong><u>^</u></strong></a><strong>Delphi method for aggregating judgment</strong></h3><p>[Click on the caret (^) above to be taken to the more in-depth explanation]</p><h3><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6miasxvmrGZChosBc/list-of-interventions-for-improving-institutional-decision#__Including__decision_observers__into_group_deliberation__debiasing_\"><strong><u>^</u></strong></a><strong>Including \u201cdecision observers\u201d into group deliberation (debiasing)</strong></h3><p>[Click on the caret (^) above to be taken to the more in-depth explanation]</p><h3><strong>Structured expert judgment techniques (group)</strong></h3><p>These are \u201ctechniques for using expert judgment as scientific data\u201d (Coleson &amp; Cooke, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ress.2017.02.003\"><u>2017</u></a>).

An initial look into each of them did not give me enough insight to tell whether I should make an entry for each or whether I should group them all into one.

This is also related to the intervention \u201c<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6miasxvmrGZChosBc/list-of-interventions-for-improving-institutional-decision#__Using_post_analytic_techniques\">using post-analytic techniques</a>\u201d further down in this document, where you can take a look at the evidence backing coherentization and aggregation of expert judgment. Basically, the idea is to survey experts on, for example, the likelihood that X, Y, or Z will happen. You then might decrease the weights of the expert judgments that do not conform to the axioms of probability (e.g., the probabilities of mutually exclusive events exhaustive of the sample space don\u2019t add up to one). Finally, you would take the mean of these weighted judgments to come to a \u201cfinal say\u201d on the matter. This is a huge oversimplification of the process, so please refer to the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6miasxvmrGZChosBc/list-of-interventions-for-improving-institutional-decision#__Using_post_analytic_techniques\"><u>^Using post-analytic techniques</u></a>&nbsp;section below, where evidence in favor of this approach is given.</p><h3><strong>Developing and using consensus-building discussion platforms</strong></h3><p>Taiwan has experimented with discussion platforms designed to build consensus instead of enhancing disagreements. Developing social media platforms (or changing existing ones) designed with the goal of building common ground, amplifying nuanced opinions, and avoiding echo chambers could be one way of decreasing polarization. This does not seem very tractable to me, but if you are interested check out the following Wired <a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/taiwan-democracy-social-media\"><u>article</u></a>&nbsp;on Taiwan\u2019s so-called \u201cdemocracy experiments.\u201d</p><h3><strong>Facilitating&nbsp;group deliberation</strong></h3><p>Group deliberation carries the risk of groupthink. Perspective sharing and constructive criticism are two ways to avoid this (Kerr &amp; Tindale, 2004, as cited in Stauffer et al., 2021). See Stauffer et al. (2021) for more relevant resources. Even in the absence of groupthink, how can a group conversation be made more effective?

The research behind this seems speculative, and has been challenged by Lindenfors (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8103230/\"><u>2021</u></a>), among others. The reasoning behind this intervention is trying to limit the number of people in any one office to some number (maybe Dunbar\u2019s, maybe another), so that people\u2019s capacity to build relationships within the (sub-)organization is not exceeded. It seems intuitively correct that an office with 1000 people would not be able to accommodate the same levels of cooperation/coordination as one with 50 people. The main question for others to investigate is if this effect is big enough to warrant advising institutions to limit their offices to X number of people. For examples of this intervention being applied, see this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunbar%2527s_number\"><u>Wikipedia article</u></a>, under \u201cpopularization.\u201d</p><h3><strong>Restructuring of internal voting systems / electoral&nbsp;systems&nbsp;(general)</strong></h3><p>These topics definitely deserve more attention than I had time to dedicate to them.

These steps seem to be in line with other normative approaches that I have learned throughout my Behavioral Decision Sciences studies at Brown University, but there may be other, better frameworks of valuing decision quality. The advantage of the DQ scale&nbsp;is that it is process-focused, which means that using it can provide more clarity on which aspects of the decision-making process are lacking <i>while</i>&nbsp;making decisions, not <i>after</i>&nbsp;they have been made.</p><h3><strong>Using Causal Decision Diagrams&nbsp;(CDDs)</strong></h3><p>Dr. Lorien Pratt advocates for the use of CDDs, which she introduces in a series of posts on <a href=\"https://www.lorienpratt.com/\"><u>her website</u></a>. I have done less reading on these than on the Decision Quality scale above, but the resources in Pratt\u2019s website seem worth investigating.</p><h3><strong>Improving choice architecture, nudging (general)</strong></h3><p>This <a href=\"https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/psychology/choice-architecture\"><u>article</u></a>&nbsp;from <a href=\"https://thedecisionlab.com/\"><u>The Decision Lab</u></a>&nbsp;gives a better explanation than I could here. This is a group of interventions (hence the label \u201cgeneral\u201d). The key insight of <a href=\"https://www.behavioraleconomics.com/resources/mini-encyclopedia-of-be/nudge/\"><u>nudge theory</u></a>&nbsp;is that the way in which options are presented (the choice architecture) matters. Without restricting freedom of choice, it is possible to nudge people into choosing certain options instead of others. This is a uniquely interesting intervention, in that it is easy to not only increase the technical quality of decisions (the focus of this article), but also better align institutions\u2019 decisions to altruistic goals. See an <a href=\"https://stanford.app.box.com/s/yohfziywajw3nmwxo7d3ammndihibe7g\"><u>example</u></a>&nbsp;for increasing participation in organ donation programs \u2014 changing default and/or recommended options for employees could change outcomes to be more aligned with the choice architect\u2019s preferences.

I have the intuition that, for many people, a short, well-run workshop could dramatically increase their ability to find and use credible information online. See Smart et al. (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32751018/\"><u>2016</u></a>) for an example of an IL program in the health sector.</p><h3><strong>Requiring explicit evidence for policy recommendations/general proposals</strong></h3><p>The idea is to require scientific evidence to be explicitly cited to endorse all or most aspects of policy proposals, if such evidence is available. I am not at all sure to what extent this is already the case in different countries and institutions.</p><h3><strong>Mandating public calls for evidence submissions before discussing policies</strong></h3><p>The European Commission\u2019s Joint Research Centre (JRC) published an article (Mair et al., 2019) which, among other things, considers \u201cmaking a public call for evidence at the beginning of the [policymaking] process\u201d (p. 64). This initial phase of evidence collection before discussion could increase the overlap between people\u2019s epistemic commons, and decrease the likelihood that disagreements regarding the goodness of a proposal stem from differences in people\u2019s factual knowledge.</p><p>Although this intervention comes from the policymaking space, it could just as well be used in other contexts. For example, one could require an information-sharing/pooling phase prior to group deliberation when discussing any big decisions in any type of institution.</p><h2>Decision-making and data to improve decisions</h2><h3><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6miasxvmrGZChosBc/list-of-interventions-for-improving-institutional-decision#__Other_Decision_Support_Systems__DSS_\"><strong><u>^</u></strong></a><strong>Other Decision Support Systems (DSS)</strong></h3><p>[Click on the caret (^) above to be taken to the more in-depth explanation]</p><h3><strong>Using the EAST Framework for behavioral interventions</strong></h3><p>This comes from the Behavioral Insights Team\u2019s (BIT) Behavioral Government <a href=\"https://www.bi.team/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/BIT-Publication-EAST_FA_WEB.pdf\"><u>report</u></a>.

See a primer <a href=\"https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/management/east-framework\"><u>here</u></a>, and consider reading the Behavioral Government report linked above.</p><h3><strong>Increasing policymaker-researcher collaboration, co-defining research questions</strong></h3><p>One theory of why policymakers don\u2019t always use sufficient scientific evidence in drafting policies is that researchers are not producing policy-relevant research. Maire et al. (2019) mentioned that, in order to make research more policy-relevant, research questions could be co-defined by researchers and policymakers. This is just one way of increasing policymaker-researcher collaboration. I remember having read a paper which found no increase in evidence uptake by policymakers after co-defining research questions, but I could not find it among my notes.</p><h3><strong>Improving the science-policy interface</strong></h3><p>The goal is to increase the degree to which policymakers privilege scientific information over other, less-reliable sources of information. Some barriers to this happening are \u201clack of access to and relevance of research, the mismatch between research timelines and policy deadlines, and the lack of funding schemes to support policy-relevant research projects\u201d (Oliver et al., 2014, as cited in Stauffer et al., 2021). Two ways of addressing these issues could be: (1) funding and training interface actors to act as facilitators of information exchange between researchers and policymakers, and (2) through funding timely and policy-relevant evidence syntheses (see the intervention above and the intervention on <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6miasxvmrGZChosBc/list-of-interventions-for-improving-institutional-decision#_Establishing_rapid_research_services__evidence_hotlines_and_helpdesks\">rapid research services</a> in this post for more information).</p><h2>Monitoring and improving ongoing performance</h2><h3><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6miasxvmrGZChosBc/list-of-interventions-for-improving-institutional-decision#__Institutionalizing_the_recording_of_quantitative_judgmental_predictions_of_advisors_analysts_and_decision_makers\"><strong><u>^</u></strong></a><strong>Institutionalizing the recording of quantitative judgmental predictions of advisors/analysts and decision-makers</strong></h3><p>[Click on the caret (^) above to be taken to the more in-depth explanation]</p><h3><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6miasxvmrGZChosBc/list-of-interventions-for-improving-institutional-decision#__Using_post_analytic_techniques\"><strong><u>^</u></strong></a><strong>Using post-analytic techniques</strong></h3><p>[Click on the caret (^) above to be taken to the more in-depth explanation]</p><h3><strong>Facilitating anonymous 360-degree feedback among employees</strong></h3><p>See <a href=\"https://www.betterup.com/blog/360-degree-feedback\"><u>this article</u></a>&nbsp;for more context. The idea is to create the opportunity for employees who work closely together to provide anonymous feedback on each other\u2019s performance (broadly defined). This feedback could be given directly from employee to employee, or summarized by a third party. A list of potential benefits and drawbacks are mentioned in the article linked above, and it is not clear to me that the benefits outweigh the potential risks. I am including this here because it is worth investigating different mechanisms for providing feedback within institutions.</p><h2>Interactions between institutions and across institutional ecosystems</h2><h3><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6miasxvmrGZChosBc/list-of-interventions-for-improving-institutional-decision#__Creating_and_funding_evidence_clearinghouses_for_IIDM\"><strong><u>^</u></strong></a><strong>Creating&nbsp;and funding evidence clearinghouses for IIDM</strong></h3><p>[Click on the caret (^) above to be taken to the more in-depth explanation]</p><h3><strong>Increasing mechanism design literacy (training)</strong></h3><p>See Maskin (<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19186444.2019.1591087\"><u>2019</u></a>) for more context. In broad terms, mechanism design consists in identifying a desired outcome and engineering the mechanisms needed to bring about that outcome. In the context of IIDM, this could mean two things. First, mechanism design could help us envisage new future institutions, and backwards engineer what exactly they would have to be like for them to fulfill this purpose. Second, mechanism design concepts could be helpful tools in reforming existing institutions by envisaging what changes we want to happen and then backwards engineering how we should get there.</p><p>Note that this intervention could have been categorized under the \u201cindividual-level judgment and decision-making.\u201d This depends on whether the training itself or the institutional change is emphasized.

Systems thinking training refers to helping people build better mental models of systems (regularly interacting or interdependent groups of items forming a unified wholes<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7z5mo2s40m5\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7z5mo2s40m5\">[4]</a></sup></span>). This might include helping people identify system properties, better generate mental models, appreciate feedback loops, interdependence, etc. (Stauffer et al., 2021).</p><p>Tonn (2021) states that \u201cimproving systems literacy worldwide could have profound positive impacts on all levels of decision-making\u201d (p. 157).</p><p>The same note about the categorization of the intervention above applies here.</p><h2>Improving knowledge about the future</h2><h3><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6miasxvmrGZChosBc/list-of-interventions-for-improving-institutional-decision#__Providing__Superforecasting__training_to_decision_makers\"><strong><u>^</u></strong></a><strong>Providing \u201cSuperforecasting\u201d training to decision-makers</strong></h3><p>[Click on the caret (^) above to be taken to the more in-depth explanation]</p><h3><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6miasxvmrGZChosBc/list-of-interventions-for-improving-institutional-decision#__Improving_communication_of_uncertainty\"><strong><u>^</u></strong></a><strong>Improving&nbsp;communication of uncertainty</strong></h3><p>[Click on the caret (^) above to be taken to the more in-depth explanation]</p><h3><strong>Creating internal prediction markets or forecasting competitions</strong></h3><p>See this <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/prediction-markets\"><u>Forum post</u></a>&nbsp;on prediction markets. The idea of this intervention is to create small-scale prediction markets within the same institution. This would involve some system through which people make forecasts on decision-relevant outcomes, and either (a) some reward system rewards those who make the most accurate predictions, or (b) people are allowed to buy and sell shares of outcomes (hence the \u2018market\u2019 aspect).</p><p>As I see them, IIDM interventions should focus first and foremost on what the institution itself can change to improve itself \u2014 not on what third parties should do that would benefit the institution (since it is harder to institute this change). And an institution, especially large ones, could always create an internal prediction market or prediction competition to crowdsource forecasts. However, this does not discard that the decision-makers in an institution should still gauge the probabilities of future events by taking into consideration \u201cexternal,\u201d i.e., public, prediction markets as well whenever possible.</p><h3><strong>Engaging in premortem and backcasting during group deliberations</strong></h3><p>Premortem analysis involves the following hypothetical: \u201cassume your plan has failed. What happened?\u201d This seems powerful to me for two reasons. One, you are forced to think through several potential failure modes of your plans; and two, explicitly engaging in premortem analysis as a team could take pressure off teammates to conform, thus decreasing the risk of groupthink. See this <a href=\"https://hbr.org/2007/09/performing-a-project-premortem\"><u>HBR article</u></a>&nbsp;for more context.</p><p>Backcasting: As this <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backcasting\"><u>Wikipedia article</u></a>&nbsp;states, backcasting asks: \u201cif we want to attain a certain goal, what actions must be taken to get there?\u201d I am sure you can see how this relates to premortem analysis, and also mechanism design (on this same post). Since I did not prioritize these interventions, I have no idea what empirical evidence behind them exists, but they seem promising at face value.</p><h3><strong>Forecasting techniques: using superforecasters</strong></h3><p>An interesting idea is deliberately finding superforecasters (top ~2% of people who demonstrably most accurately predict future events) and commissioning them to forecast outcomes that are decision-relevant for the institution. Other forecasting techniques are already on this list, like creating prediction markets, probabilistic calibration training, and more.</p><p>See this CSER <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3DlfPJ7Tz4JGs\"><u>conference recording</u></a>, around the 1 hour 9 minute mark for other forecasting and strategic foresight techniques. See also the book Superforecasting by Tetlock (2015).</p><h3><strong>Foresight techniques*</strong></h3><p>*This is a group of interventions. They are grouped together here due to lack of time to investigate and categorize each individually.</p><p>Some potentially valuable foresight techniques are: gaming and roleplaying (serious games), scenario construction, horizon scanning, red-teaming, analysis of unanticipated unintended consequences (UUCs), analysis of unknown unknowns (UKUKs), and singular chains of events scenarios (SCES), and other tools shared with forecasting (prediction markets, superforecasting).</p><p>I think that foresight techniques might be unfairly disregarded or discounted in comparison to forecasting techniques in EA circles, although there might be legitimate reasons for this.

They are grouped together here due to lack of time to investigate and categorize each individually.</p><p>Strategic planning refers, broadly, to the process through which organizations\u2019 leaders define the organization\u2019s goals and general direction. Some examples of strategic planning techniques are SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats) analysis, Porter\u2019s Five Forces, and <a href=\"https://www.softwareadvice.com/resources/strategic-planning-tools/\"><u>more</u></a>. These seem especially prevalent in the business world, but I have no clue as to their effectiveness \u2014 this might be worth investigating.</p><h3><strong>Fostering moral reflection (general)</strong></h3><p>This means \u201cmotivating actors to reflect on the future and expand their circle of compassion to future lives\u201d (Stauffer et al., <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maxime-Stauffer-2/publication/351050249_Policymaking_for_the_Long-term_Future_Improving_Institutional_Fit/links/60814898881fa114b41c034e/Policymaking-for-the-Long-term-Future-Improving-Institutional-Fit.pdf\"><u>2021</u></a>; p. 20). The cited paper is the only one in which I encountered this idea, and it is worth noting that, although the paper focuses on longtermist policymaking, the idea of fostering moral reflection could be used to include not only the encompassing of future lives, but also those of people across the planet and nonhuman animals. This is one of the few interventions on this list that focus on value alignment instead of increasing the technical quality of institutions\u2019 decisions.</p><h1>List of prioritized interventions</h1><p>I did not have enough time to write polished descriptions for all interventions on the list. I therefore marked 11&nbsp;interventions as \u201cprioritized interventions,\u201d marked with a caret (^), to write lengthier descriptions of them. They are listed below.</p><p>I chose which interventions to prioritize based on my subjective judgment of their potential, ease of application, or quantity of existing relevant research.</p><p>These descriptions are not meant to be a review of the intervention\u2019s efficacy, but rather a way for the reader to better understand what is meant by the intervention\u2019s title, and to provide a starting point of a couple of papers/resources for the reader to start his or her research.</p><p>The format of most of these is: 1) an explanation of the intervention, 2) examples of the intervention being implemented (when possible), 3) remaining questions that I had after my relatively shallow research, and 4) resources for you to investigate the intervention further.</p><h3><strong>^ Delphi method for aggregating judgment</strong></h3><p>The Delphi method, or Delphi technique, is a structured approach to extracting information from a group of people, typically experts in some area. It is used as a foresight/forecasting technique, as a tool for building consensus, and for getting information in situations where data are lacking. It probably is, as far as my research goes, the most popular method on the list (by that I mean, the most concrete \u201cintervention\u201d that I\u2019ve seen endorsed over and over by different authors).</p><p>Basically, the method consists in gathering a group of experts who are willing to participate (online), and guiding them through two or more rounds of surveys in which the participants share their views (for forecasting, quantitative probability estimates, otherwise it could be agreement with a question on a scale) and reasons for them. Between every round, an anonymized summary of everyone\u2019s responses during the last round is shared with the participants, who can make and answer comments. The idea is that with each consecutive round, opinions will tend to converge as respondents adjust their responses in light of other people\u2019s reasoning. Hsu &amp; Sandford (2007), as well as others (see Duffield, 1993; Breckon &amp; Dodson, 2006) claim that it is an effective tool for building consensus.</p><p><strong>The IDEA Protocol:</strong>&nbsp;the IDEA (investigate, discuss, estimate, and aggregate) is a modified Delphi method, which some have claimed is the most effective form of Delphi, at least for forecasting purposes.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhm0tp714k1p\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhm0tp714k1p\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I highly recommend reading Hemming et al.

Dawes (1979, 1971) showed that linear models consistently outperform admissions officers in predicting graduate school applicants\u2019 future performance. But linear models (and statistical predictors in general) can be used in a broad array of situations. For example, after someone used marital (un)happiness as an example of something that Dawes wouldn\u2019t be able to predict with linear models, Dawes (1979) created a very simple predictor: \u201crate of lovemaking minus rate of fighting\u201d (ibid.)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5hgbau99dq5\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5hgbau99dq5\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; This metric turned out to be an (astonishingly) accurate predictor, as it was correlated with marital (un)happiness at .40 (p. &lt;0.05) (Howard &amp; Dawes, 1976). A later replication study found a correlation of .81 (p. 0.01) (Edwards and Edwards, 1977).</p><p>Dawes (1979) writes that \u201cpeople are bad at integrating information from diverse and incomparable sources.

As the three of them make precise quantitative predictions (forecasts) about a great quantity of events, both the forecasts and the results of the events once known (i.e., the terrorist was/was not there) are recorded, so that one can determine the accuracy or level of calibration of each advisor with something like <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score\"><u>Brier scores</u></a>.

The paper cited focused on the intelligence community (IC), but post-analytic techniques could be used just as well by any institution that records probability judgments (see the intervention above). This paper proposes two promising post-analytic techniques: <strong>coherentization</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>aggregation</strong>.</p><p><strong>Coherentization</strong>&nbsp;means correcting probability judgments so that they better conform to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_axioms\"><u>axioms of probability theory</u></a>&nbsp;(ibid.). For example: if an analyst claims that there\u2019s a .5 probability of war and a .6 probability of peace (silly example, but go with it), and those are the only two possibilities, then coherentization <i>could mean</i>&nbsp;adjusting the probabilities to .4545 &nbsp;and .5454 (to keep the relative likelihoods the same but make the sum of both add up to 1<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjy2hatr0qrp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjy2hatr0qrp\">[10]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpxubf37gp5\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpxubf37gp5\">[11]</a></sup></span>). There are different methods of coherentization, including <strong>normalization</strong>&nbsp;and <strong>CAP-based methods</strong>.</p><p>According to Mandel et al. (2018), Karvetski, Olson, Mandel et al. (2013) have shown that coherentization methods can significantly improve judgment accuracy.</p><p><strong>Aggregation</strong>&nbsp;in this context means aggregating the probability judgments of different people. Mandel et al. (2018) write that \u201csubstantial benefits to accuracy were achieved by taking the arithmetic average of as few as three analysts\u201d (p. 13), and that giving different weights (coherence-based weights<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0hzuqws8kdur\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0hzuqws8kdur\">[12]</a></sup></span>) to participants\u2019 judgments didn\u2019t yield higher group accuracy, although others have found that it does (ibid.).</p><p>Recalibration and aggregation methods substantially improved accuracy: <strong>mean absolute error decreased 61% after coherentizing and aggregating judgments </strong>in Mandel et al. (2018).</p><p>Another example of a post-analytic technique not discussed in Mandel (2018) is the <strong>extremization of aggregated probability judgments</strong>&nbsp;(Tetlock &amp; Gardner, 2016). Extremization of probability judgments means getting them closer to the extremes (or farther from 0.5) \u2014 so, if the original prediction is that there is a .7 probability that you will upvote this post, extremizing it might mean increasing the probability to .8 (thank you very much), and if it was .3, decreasing it to .2, or .27, etc.</p><p>See the following footnote for an explanation as to why extremizing aggregations of probability judgments appears to increase accuracy.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjoxlwu0709s\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjoxlwu0709s\">[13]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Examples: institutionalizing the use of the post-analytic techniques mentioned above.</p><p>Resources:</p><ul><li>Boosting intelligence analysts\u2019 judgment accuracy: What works, what fails?

What are other publicly available forecasting courses that institutions could use now to train their decision-makers?</p><h3><strong>^ Improving communication of uncertainty</strong></h3><p>People appear to mean very different things when using words such as \u201cpossibly,\u201d \u201clikely,\u201d \u201cprobable,\u201d etc. Tetlock &amp; Gardner (2016) mention the case of people describing \u201ca serious possibility\u201d as odds anywhere between 80 to 20 and 20 to 80. Budescu et al. (1988) write that individuals have \u201csubstantial working vocabularies of uncertainty, with nevertheless relatively little overlap among individuals\u201d (p. 290), and show that \u201call comparisons favored the numeric over the verbal response mode\u201d (p. 290). In Budescu et al. (1988), one can see how verbal probabilities can be interpreted in significantly different ways by different people (see the table below):<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhub9gms313\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhub9gms313\">[16]</a></sup></span></p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1675398424/mirroredImages/6miasxvmrGZChosBc/aqi56m36mwx7n96krycj.png\" alt=\"\"></p><p>I chose this as a promising intervention because of the apparent ease of implementation, although I might&nbsp;be overestimating this ease due to being friends with many other EAs for whom numerical descriptions of uncertainty are commonsensical. Dhami et al. (2015) propose three decision-science approaches to improving intelligence analysis, and could be taken as institutional interventions:</p><ul><li>\u201cUse methods that translate analysts\u2019 terms into ones that have equivalent meaning for decision makers\u201d (p. 755). For a discussion on developing a general Linguistic Probability Translator (LiProT), see Karelitz &amp; Budescu (2004).</li><li>\u201cRemind decision makers of numerical interpretations of verbal terms in the text of an analytic report\u201d (Dhami et al., p. 755). One could adopt a standard 7-step verbal probability scale with associated numerical probabilities, and set up mechanisms (like reminders) to make sure that the scale is understood and used both internally and explicitly stated in communications between the institution and third parties. One possible criticism by Tetlock &amp; Gardner (2016) is that a 5- or 7-step probability scale does not allow for \u201csufficient shades of maybe.\u201d Either way, this seems like an improvement from just stating verbal probabilities.</li><li>\u201cAdopt numerical probabilities in contexts where precision matters, such as forecasting.\u201d (Dhami et al., p. 755).</li></ul><p>For criticisms and counter-arguments on adopting numerical probabilities for communicating uncertainty, see Tetlock &amp; Gardner (2016).</p><p>Resources:</p><ul><li>Budescu, D.

This might also make the list more legible for people who have read the EIP\u2019s scoping survey, and provide a useful anchor for new information. The results of the survey also helped me prioritize: the more in-scope a field was found to be for IIDM, the higher the category appears on the list.</p><h2>Problems with \u201csource field\u201d categorization</h2><p>As you can see below, this approach is far from perfect. I presume that if others took the time to categorize the same interventions, they would produce notably different results.

Per the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.1003901\"><u>Moitra et al</u></a> systematic review and Bayesian meta-analysis, the percentage of people getting minimally adequate treatment for depression in high-income, upper-middle income, and lower middle- &amp; low-income countries was 23%, 8% and 3% respectively. Assuming that the wealth of high-income countries means that everyone who wants treatment gets it, and assuming desire for treatment does not vary systematically with country income, 23% is the theoretical maximum number of people who would get treated given perfect healthcare access, with the remainder being people who are unwilling to seek treatment for one reason or another (e.g. social stigma). This being the case, the fraction of untreated depression sufferers who can nonetheless be helped by increased access, relative to the global population of depression sufferers, is simply (a) the difference between current treatment rates in low and lower-middle income countries and the 23% maximum just described, (b) the same difference for upper-medium income countries, (c) zero, for high income countries, all of which is (d) combined as a weighted average that factors in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL?locations=XD-XT-XN-XM\"><u>relative population sizes</u></a>. Then, to translate this fraction of untreated depression sufferers who can nonetheless be helped by increased access, into the fraction of the global disease burden attributable to lack of access to treatment, we simply adjust for the fact that treated individuals experience a lower disease burden relative to their untreated counterfactual baseline, with this in turn calculated on the rough empirical basis that everyone is treated within a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21820991/\"><u>year</u></a> and that the reduction in disease burden due to treatment varies&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5673035/\"><u>linearly</u></a> in time.</p><p>Finally, as for the question of how much of this remaining disease burden would be reduced by comprehensive access and use of mental health drugs \u2013 this is a function of the per patient&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19588448/\"><u>effectiveness</u></a> of SSRIs, which is taken to be the inverse of the median NNT (i.e. number of people that need to be treated to prevent one additional bad outcome).</p><p>Overall, the potential harm eliminable from fully comprehensive access to mental health drugs in DALY terms, as a function of (a) the global burden of disease of depression in DALY terms, (b) the proportion of the global disease burden attributable to lack of access to treatment, and (c) the proportion of the remaining disease burden of depression that would be reduced by comprehensive access and use of mental health drugs, is&nbsp;<strong>2.81 * 10<sup>6</sup> DALYs</strong>.</p><p><strong><u>Persistence</u></strong>: The problem of depression isn't going anywhere anytime soon, and indeed, is expected to grow.

Assuming an intervention of providing full treatment as soon as possible in a single year to all depressed individuals who want treatment but are not currently receiving it, reversal is a function of both the relapse rate as well as the replacement rate (i.e. the population experiencing turnover from some people dying out and others entering into it). The relapse rate is calculated as the average of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21820991/\"><u>year-on-year relapse rate across a decade</u></a>. The population turnover rate is approximated as the inverse of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN\"><u>life expectancy</u></a>. Together, this yields a very considerable reversal rate of&nbsp;<strong>10%</strong> per annum.</p><p>Secondly, I calculate the proportion of disease burden that will remain after being counterfactually solved \u2013 or in fact, because the problem will grow, the increased disease burden over time. To do this, I use a simple theoretical model that treats total DALYs lost to depression as a function of DALYs lost per capita and population size.</p><p>Note that whatever efforts that agents (i.e. governments, nonprofits and businesses) are making to solve the problem (e.g. channelling more resources to treating depression in the public health system, private non-profit hospitals or private for-profit hospitals respectively), and whatever impact that structural trends are having (e.g. social atomization increasing social alienation and consequently the prevalence and severity of depression; or higher GDP allowing more resources to be spent on treatment; or increasing median age increasing DALY burden due to older people being more susceptible to depression), all this will occur through and is hence accounted for by the variable of DALYs lost per capita. The only exception is population size - increasing population size (and eventually, declining population) will, for a given per capita rate of DALYs lost to depression, increase (and eventually decrease) total DALYs lost; and this variable, of course, is handled separately in the model.</p><p>And to implement this model and project how the problem is expected to evolve over the years, I:</p><ol><li>Project future DALYs lost to depression per capita by estimating the year-on-year change through a linear regression of DALYs lost to depression per capita on discrete time.</li><li>Use UN estimates of projected future population growth; and&nbsp;</li><li>Multiply each future year's DALYs lost per capita and population size to obtain the expected total DALY burden for each year.</li></ol><p>That said, I limit the extrapolation to 2100 - the high-confidence UN estimate ends there, and I assume constant population after; moreover, I cap the growth of DALYs lost per capita since an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/cns-spectrums/article/abs/age-and-risk-for-depression-among-the-elderly-a-metaanalysis-of-the-published-literature/71D0E9628D52C2641F2C5B736C13A537\"><u>important</u></a> unfavourable underlying trend of increasing median age will eventually cease once population stabilizes, and after that I model the per capita rate as declining as quickly as it was rising, on the basis of the remaining drivers being net favourable (various agents trying to solve the problem, while cultural and economic structural drivers cancel out).</p><p>The projected growth of DALYS lost to depression is shown in&nbsp;<strong>Diagram 1</strong>.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/gKACnurTDna5RsNd8/qi8xv9qrqry5wjmp59c9\"></p><p><strong>Diagram 1</strong>: Growth of DALYs lost to depression over time</p><p>For 2101 and beyond, modelling the expected decline as equal to the DALY per capita growth rate up till 2100 yields a discount of&nbsp;<strong>0.2%</strong> per annum.</p><p>Thirdly, I discount for the probability of the world being destroyed anyway (i.e. general existential risk discount). I take into account the probability of total nuclear annihilation, since the benefits of saving people from depression in one year is nullified if they had already died in a previous year. For the exact risk of total nuclear annihilation, I take it to be one magnitude lower than the risk of nuclear war itself, since nuclear war may not kill everyone. For the probability of nuclear war, I use the various estimates on the probability of nuclear war per annum collated by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/KJNrGbt3JWcYeifLk/p/PAYa6on5gJKwAywrF\"><u>Luisa</u></a>, but with accidental nuclear war factored in, and then calculate a weighted average that significantly favours the superforecasters. The reason for this is that (a) the estimate of the probability of intentional nuclear war based on historical frequency is likely biased upwards due to historical use being in a MAD-free context; (b) the probability of accidental nuclear war based on historical close calls is highly uncertain due to the difficulty of translating close calls to actual probabilities of eventual launch; and (c) experts are notoriously bad at long-range forecasts, relative to superforecasters. Meanwhile, I do not take into account other existential risks like supervolcano eruption and asteroid impact, since the chances of those occurring at all is very marginal per&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Feeding-Everyone-Matter-What-Catastrophe/dp/0128044470\"><u>Denkenberger &amp; Pearce</u></a>, let alone the chances of such events killing everyone and not just most people. Overall, therefore, I treat the general existential risk discount to be just the risk of nuclear war but adjusted a magnitude down&nbsp; (i.e.&nbsp;<strong>0.07%&nbsp;</strong>per annum).</p><p>Fourthly, I apply a broad uncertainty discount of&nbsp;<strong>0.1%</strong> per annum to take into account the fact that there is a non-zero chance that in the future, the benefits or costs do not persist for factors we do not and cannot identify in the present (e.g. actors directing resources to solve the problem when none are currently doing so).</p><p>Overall, by taking the projected trend of DALYs lost to depression up to 2100, and discounting each year's DALY burden using the other per annum discounts (i.e. solution reversal discount, existential risk discount, uncertainty discount), the total amount of DALYs due to depression that would be counterfactually solved by a total solution is shown in&nbsp;<strong>Diagram 2</strong>.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/gKACnurTDna5RsNd8/mtha18tqbwmenuruqlaa\"></p><p><strong>Diagram 2</strong>: DALYs available for solution by SSRI distribution</p><p><strong><u>Value of Outcome</u></strong>: Overall, summing the discounted per annum relative values for 2023-2100, and using a perpetual value formula to incorporate the 2101+ values, this yields a raw perpetual value of improved health from better access to mental health drugs of&nbsp;<strong>2.9 * 10<sup>7</sup> DALYs</strong>.</p><p><strong><u>Probability of Occurrence</u></strong>: As for the probability that lack of access to mental health drugs is a problem (or, equivalently, the probability that expanding access positively impacts welfare, this is a function of four critical variables:</p><ul><li>Probability that depression is an actual problem that harms people: Unlike longtermist problems, there is no uncertainty that depression is an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21820991/\"><u>actual problem</u></a>. The World Health Organization (WHO) has demonstrated that depressive disorders are one of the leading causes of disease worldwide, with the reported prevalence throughout the world of depressive episodes being 16 per 100,000 per year for males and 25 per 100,000 per year for females, and with depression being the fourth leading cause of disease burden in the world, accounting for 4.4% of total DALY burden as of 2004. And of course, the problem has hardly been solved since then. Trivially, I assign the probability to be 1.</li><li>Probability that a doctor correctly identifies a patient as depressed and requiring treatment: Empirically, doctors have about a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hup.398\"><u>55%</u></a> success rate.</li><li>Probability that people given access to mental health drugs will actually use them as prescribed: Statistically, people adhere to the prescribed course only&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3398686/\"><u>50%</u></a> of the time.</li><li>Probability that SSRIs work: This is given as 99.999% (i.e. 1 less the probability that the null hypothesis is true and that the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19588448/\"><u>observed relationship</u></a> between SSRI usage and positive clinical response at post-treatment is purely due to random chance).</li></ul><p>Overall, this yields a probability of&nbsp;<strong>27.5%</strong> that lack of access to mental health drugs is a problem whose solution would be beneficial.</p><p><strong><u>Expected Value</u></strong>: Hence, the expected value of improved health from better access to mental health drugs is&nbsp;<strong>7.99 * 10<sup>6</sup> DALYs.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong><u>Expected Benefit: Increased Economic Output</u></strong></h1><p>Accompanying the reduction of the disease burden will be lower healthcare costs and improved productivity, thus promising an expected benefit of increased economic output. Overall, this economic benefit is worth the equivalent of around&nbsp;<strong>5.14 * 10<sup>5</sup> DALYs</strong>, and is modelled as follows.</p><p><strong><u>Moral Weights</u></strong>: The value of doubling consumption for one person for one year is&nbsp;<strong>0.21 DALYs</strong>, which is calculated as a function of (a) the value of consumption relative to life from GiveWell's IDinsight survey of the community perspective, as adjusted for social desirability bias, and (b) CEARCH's estimate of the value of a full, healthy life in DALY terms. For more details, refer to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1j67pOUpC5vhC1-H516PAj2-4Fvm5rxJhZNeBVav3kik/edit\"><u>CEARCH's evaluative framework</u></a>.</p><p><strong><u>Scale</u></strong>: To calculate the scale of the potential benefit, I first look at the economic burden of depression relative to annual income per depression sufferer. And to do this, I rely on three separate estimates.</p><p>Firstly, we have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40273-021-01019-4\"><u>Greenberg et al's</u></a> estimate of the total US economic cost of major depressive disorder (covering direct medical costs, loss of earnings due to suicide, and reduced labour supply and productivity due to depression causing both absenteeism and presenteeism), which I then adjust to account for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/\"><u>chronic depression</u></a> (assuming economic burden varies proportionally with disease burden). This is then divided by the number of depression sufferers in the US to get the economic burden of depression per depression sufferer, which is then divided in turn by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=US\"><u>annual income</u></a> to yield the economic burden of depression relative to annual income per depression sufferer.</p><p>Secondly, we have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-08871-004\"><u>Sobocki et al's</u></a> estimate of the total European economic cost of depression in euros (covering direct medical costs as well as economic costs from morbidity and mortality).&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/2548/euro-dollar-exchange-rate-historical-chart\"><u>Converting</u></a> this to USD, we can then divide it by the number of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/\"><u>depression sufferers in Europe</u></a> to get the economic burden of depression per depression sufferer, and then further divide by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=EU\"><u>annual income</u></a> to get the economic burden of depression relative to annual income per depression sufferer.</p><p>Thirdly, we have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00127-006-0151-2\"><u>Hu et al's</u></a> estimate of the total Chinese economic cost of depression (covering both direct as well as indirect costs), which by dividing through with the number of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/\"><u>depression sufferers in China</u></a>, we can use to get the economic burden of depression per depression sufferer. Dividing that in turn by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=CN\"><u>annual income</u></a> again yields the economic burden of depression relative to annual income per depression sufferer.</p><p>In creating a weighted average of the three estimates, I penalize the Sobocki et al estimate given the chances of potential misestimation, from our analysis treating Europe as the EU for simplicity. Additionally, I penalize both the Greenberg et al and Sobocki et al estimates given that the cases of depression we will be targeting with expanded access to mental health drugs will be in LMICs, for which US/EU data will be less representative compared to Chinese data.</p><p>This weighted average in turn yields the degree of consumption doubling per depression sufferer if their depression is cured.</p><p>Then, we can calculate the total number of consumption doublings achievable through better access to mental health drugs in 2023 \u2013 the base figure is just the degree of consumption doubling per depression sufferer if their depression is cured, multiplied by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/\"><u>2019 prevalence of depression</u></a>, but further adjusted (a) to account for increased prevalence in 2023, (b) to focus only on the economic burden attributable to a lack of access to treatment, and (c) to account for the fact that SSRIs only have a certain effectiveness. All this accounted for, we see that there is a potential total of 576,000 doublings in consumption from treating all the depressed who want treatment but do not currently receive it.</p><p><strong><u>Persistence</u></strong>: The same per annum discounts and the same projections of the disease burden (and hence economic burden) over time, as discussed in the previous section, are used here as well.</p><p><strong><u>Value of Outcome</u></strong>: Overall, the raw perpetual value of increased economic output is&nbsp;<strong>1.89 * 10<sup>6</sup> DALYs</strong>.</p><p><strong><u>Probability of Occurrence</u></strong>: Same overall probability as before is applied.</p><p><strong><u>Expected Value</u></strong>: All in all, the expected value of increased economic output is&nbsp;<strong>5.14 * 10<sup>5</sup> DALYs</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong><u>Expected Cost: Worse Health from Adverse Drug Side-Effects</u></strong></h1><p>With all that said, increasing access to mental health drugs is a not a risk free exercise \u2013 there are, unfortunately, potential adverse side-effects to SSRI consumption, and that is an expected cost we have to calculate. Our best estimate is that -<strong>4.84 * 10<sup>5</sup> DALYs</strong> are at stake here, with our calculations as follows.</p><p><strong><u>Moral Weights</u></strong>: For the expected DALYs lost from adverse events per SSRI course, I calculate this by:</p><ol><li>Estimating the DALYs lost (total disease burden divided by prevalence, and adjusted for average SSRI course duration) for each potential adverse event that occurs as a result of SSRI intake, subject to those whose occurrence are statistically significant and which are severe enough to be in the GBD</li><li>Multiplying by the event probability (as given by the inverse of the number needed to harm), and&nbsp;</li><li>Summing the expected harm of individual potential adverse events to get aggregate expected harm, of around&nbsp;<strong>-0.040 DALYs</strong> per SSRI course.</li></ol><p><strong><u>Scale</u></strong>: Taking the number of depression sufferers in 2023, and multiplying by the proportion of depression sufferers who want treatment but aren't getting it (estimated using the same model as discussed previously, where getting treatment is a function of desire for treatment subject to affordability constraints), we get the number of untreated depression sufferers who want treatment and who would potentially take SSRIs if said drugs were made available to them in 2023 - around 44.6 million people.</p><p><u>Persistence</u>: In terms of the number of years that the harm persists \u2013 recall that we are modelling the solution as providing full treatment as soon as possible in a single year to all depressed individuals who want treatment but are not currently receiving it. This being so, the cost is a one-time matter, with the SSRIs prescribed for consumption within the first year and cessation thereafter. Hence, the issue of solution reversal is irrelevant, and the total across-time cost is just the amount of disease burden from adverse drug side-effects potentially causable in a given year discounted by existential risk and uncertainty: 99.83% of the baseline year's total disease burden, in this case.</p><p><strong><u>Value of Outcome</u></strong>: Overall, the raw perpetual disvalue of worse health from adverse drug side-effects is&nbsp;<strong>-1.77 * 10<sup>6</sup> DALYs</strong>.</p><p><strong><u>Probability of Occurrence</u></strong>: The probability that access to mental health drugs causes a real problem in terms of adverse drug side-effects is a function of the following three variables:</p><ul><li>Probability that adverse drug side-effects are a genuine problem: For each side-effect, this probability is 1 less the estimated p-value; and to get the overall probability, we take a sum of the individual probabilities weighted by the relative share of expected harm, to get a probability of 99.6%.</li><li>Probability that a doctor correctly identifies a patient as depressed and requiring treatment: As discussed previously.</li><li>Probability that people given access to mental health drugs will actually use them as prescribed: As discussed previously.</li></ul><p>Overall, this yields a probability of&nbsp;<strong>27.39%</strong> that access to mental health drugs causes a real problem in terms of adverse drug side-effects</p><p><strong><u>Expected Value</u></strong>: All in all, the expected disvalue of worse health from adverse drug side-effects is -<strong>4.84 * 10<sup>5</sup> DALYs</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong><u>Expected Cost: Decreased Economic Output</u></strong></h1><p>Corresponding to the health damage done by SSRI side-effects is the economic damage. This damage is probably worth around&nbsp;<strong>-5.01 * 10<sup>4</sup> DALYs</strong>, with the modelling as follows.</p><p><strong><u>Moral Weights</u></strong>: As discussed in the section on increased economic output from curing depression.</p><p><strong><u>Scale</u></strong>: To calculate the scale of the potential cost, I first look at the economic burden of adverse drug events relative to annual income per adverse drug event sufferer, using three estimates to do so.</p><p>The first estimate is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/413536\"><u>Classen et al's</u></a>, of the US economic cost of an adverse drug event (specifically, the excess medical costs), which divided by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=US\"><u>annual income</u></a> yields the economic burden of adverse drug events relative to annual income per adverse drug event sufferer.</p><p>The second estimate is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24637879\"><u>Gyllensten et al's</u></a>, of the Swedish economic cost of an adverse drug event (covering both direct medical costs as well as indirect productivity costs), which divided by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=SE\"><u>annual income</u></a> obtains the economic burden of adverse drug events relative to annual income per adverse drug event sufferer.</p><p>The third estimate is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1472-6963-14-73\"><u>Shi et al's</u></a>, of the Chinese economic cost of an adverse drug event (as a function of total costs, covering both direct medical costs and indirect productivity costs, and of number of patients.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.exchangerates.org.uk/CNY-USD-spot-exchange-rates-history-2010.html\"><u>Converting</u></a> the output to USD and dividing through by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD?locations=CN\"><u>annual income</u></a> then produces another estimate of the economic burden of adverse drug events relative to annual income per adverse drug event sufferer.</p><p>In the weighted average, I penalize Classen et al for not taking into account indirect costs, and on top of that I penalize both Classen et al and Gyllensten et al \u2013 since US/Swedish data will be less relevant compared to Chinese data, when the people who we are targeting for expanded access to SSRIs (i.e. people who want treatment for their depression but who currently aren't being treated) will be in LMICs. This then gets us the degree of consumption doubling per adverse drug event sufferer if they had not taken SSRIs we had provided, which we can use to calculate the total number of consumption doublings prevented (by expanded access to mental health drugs causing more adverse drug events in 2023), by multiplying the first value with the number of untreated depression sufferers who want treatment and who would potentially take SSRIs if said drugs were made available to them in 2023.</p><p><strong><u>Persistence</u></strong>: The total across-time cost as a percentage of the baseline year's total disease burden is as described previously.</p><p><strong><u>Value of Outcome</u></strong>: Overall, the raw perpetual disvalue of decreased economic output is&nbsp;<strong>-1.83 * 10<sup>5</sup> DALYs</strong>.</p><p><strong><u>Probability of Occurrence</u></strong>: Same overall probability as discussed in the health costs of adverse drug events is applied here.</p><p><strong><u>Expected Value</u></strong>: All in all, the expected disvalue of decreased economic output is&nbsp;<strong>-5.01 * 10<sup>4</sup> DALYs</strong>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong><u>Tractability</u></strong></h1><p>To summarize our tractability findings: we can solve&nbsp;<strong>0.000003</strong> of the problem per additional USD 100,000 spent on direct delivery.</p><p>Direct delivery is, of course, not the only option \u2013 but there may not be better alternatives, as we shall see. To ensure access to mental health drugs, we actually have three potential methods: policy advocacy to get rich donor governments to fund greater access to mental health drugs in LMICs; policy advocacy to get LMIC governments themselves to pony up; and direct delivery itself (i.e. a charity distributing SSRIs). Generally, policy advocacy is more effective given the enormous leverage from using low-cost regulation or mobilizing low counterfactual government resources \u2013 and of course lobbying rich donor governments in particular is especially cost-effective given the extremely low counterfactual value of spending on rich world citizens. However, in this context, lobbying rich donor governments suffers from the fact that foreign aid is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://globalaffairs.org/research/public-opinion-survey/americans-support-foreign-aid-oppose-paying-it\"><u>never popular</u></a>, and in any case, mental health is probably seen as a less important cause than saving people from physical harm (e.g. AIDS etc). As for lobbying LMIC governments themselves \u2013 the same reality holds, where governments&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28469456/\"><u>prioritize</u></a> public health other than mental health when allocating limited funding, in the context of already limited health budgets. Hence, direct delivery is probably the best solution here, tied perhaps with lobbying rich donor governments, and we examine the former as a solution.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of evaluating the proportion of disease reduction we can achieve from direct delivery of SSRIs, we have two key parameters to consider.</p><ol><li>The proportion of depressed individuals, who want treatment but who currently lack it, and that primary care providers (which our direct delivery charity will be partnering with for better access) can reach and help.</li><li>The chances of convincing various primary care providers to accept the receipt of SSRIs and accompanying training</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For (1), we have to estimate four critical sub-parameters:</p><p>(a) The maximum number of primary care physicians that our hypothetical charity will be able to support. This will depend critically on the number of drugs our charity can procure, as well as on the number of depressed patients (which will be a function of sub-parameters (b) and (c), discussed below). For now, let us focus on the quantity of drugs to be procured \u2013 this depends on both the hypothetical budget above, as well as the likely proportion of the budget that the charity can spend on core services. To estimate the latter, I use the outside view and take a weighted average of what&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/amf\"><u>AMF</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/malaria-consortium\"><u>Malaria Consortium</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/new-incentives\"><u>New Incentives</u></a> spend on their core services, penalizing NI in the weighing for being less procurement-oriented (n.b. I do not use an inside view as I do not believe I have sufficient experience on direct delivery logistics to make an accurate call). With the budget for core services, we can then divide by the price of generic SSRIs \u2013 which cost&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jmcp.org/doi/pdf/10.18553/jmcp.2011.17.2.123\"><u>$174</u></a> per 6-month course, and are cheaper than their branded equivalent while being no less effective or safe \u2013 while adjusting for average SSRI course duration (around&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK361016/\"><u>7 weeks</u></a> to really feeling better and another&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medical.mit.edu/faqs/mental-health/antidepressants#faq--1283\"><u>6 months</u></a> after that to be safe).</p><p>(b) The number of unique patients each primary care physician sees a year. To estimate this, I use developed world figures for lack of better data; note that this will be biased downwards given that developing world doctors will see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5695512/\"><u>a lot</u></a> more patients (at the cost of lower consult times). Consequently, I choose the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jabfm.org/content/jabfp/29/4/496.full.pdf\"><u>high end</u></a> of the average figures (around 1900 per year) to balance this out.</p><p>(c) The percentage of patients that are depressed. This is taken as just&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/\"><u>global prevalence rates</u></a>, on the understanding that the charity will be targeting unserved areas where people are not already getting treatment via SSRIs (let alone CBT) such that we do not have to factor in the counterfactually treated.</p><p>(d) The total size of the depressed population that wants treatment but currently do not receive it.</p><p>Overall, I expect a charity with this budget to be able to solve about 0.0008% of the disease burden suffered by depressed individuals who want treatment but who currently lack it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For (2), and the operational challenge of persuading various primary care providers to accept the receipt of SSRIs and accompanying training, I evaluate this with both an outside and inside view.</p><p>For the outside view, I use multiple reference classes: (i) the general success rate of CE charities; (ii) physician attitudes towards antidepressants (since if physicians are sceptical \u2013 specifically, sceptical that antidepressants work \u2013 they would be less likely to accept the charity's offer to supply SSRIs); and (iii) the degree of support for lifelong learning amongst rural Chinese physicians (as an indicator of how willing LMIC doctors will be with respect to subjecting themselves to additional psychiatric training). That said, all these reference class have significant flaws: (i) the CE incubatee reference class is biased downwards insofar as charities can fail for other reasons (e.g. funding) than inability to deliver on their core service; (ii) the physician view of antidepressants reference class suffers from uncertainties about scepticism translating to wholesale rejection, as well as significant external validity considerations; and (iii) the lifelong learning reference class suffers from uncertainties inasmuch as positive attitudes to lifelong learning need not translate to actual likelihood of a busy doctor agreeing to and attending more training, along with similar external validity considerations. Overall, I penalize the latter two reference classes relative to the first, yielding a weighted average of a 49% probability of success.</p><p>For the inside view, I reason as follows.

This EA Forum post was prepared by Meghan Barrett, Lars Chittka, Andrew Crump, Matilda Gibbons, and Sajedeh Sarlak.&nbsp;</p><p>The 75-page publication summarizes over 350 scientific studies to assess the scientific evidence for pain across six orders of insects at, minimally, two developmental time points (juvenile, adult). In addition, the paper discusses the use and management of insects in farmed, wild, and research contexts.

We find <u>substantial evidence for pain</u> in adult insects of three additional orders, as well as some juveniles. For several criteria, evidence was distributed across the insect phylogeny, providing some reason to believe that certain kinds of evidence for pain will be found in other taxa. Trillions of insects are directly impacted by humans each year (<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/insects-raised-for-food-and-feed\">farmed</a>, <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/the-scale-of-direct-human-impact-on-invertebrates\">managed, killed, etc.</a>). <a href=\"https://www.wageningenacademic.com/doi/abs/10.3920/JIFF2022.0041\">Significant welfare concerns</a> have been identified as the result of human activities. Insect welfare is both completely unregulated and infrequently researched.&nbsp;</p><p>Given the evidence reviewed in Gibbons et al. (2022), insect welfare is both important <i>and </i>highly neglected.&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Research Summary</strong></h1><ul><li>The Birch et al. (2021) framework, which the UK government has applied to assess evidence for animal pain, uses eight neural and behavioral criteria to assess the likelihood for sentience in invertebrates: 1) nociception; 2) sensory integration; 3) integrated nociception; 4) analgesia; 5) motivational trade-offs; 6) flexible self-protection; 7) associative learning; and 8) analgesia preference.&nbsp;<ul><li>Definitions of these criteria can be found on pages 4 &amp; 5 of the publication's main text.</li></ul></li><li>Gibbons et al. (2022) applies the framework to six orders of insects at, minimally, two developmental time points per order (juvenile, adult).<ul><li>Insect orders assessed: Blattodea (cockroaches, termites), Coleoptera (beetles), Diptera (flies, mosquitoes), Hymenoptera (bees, ants, wasps, sawflies), Lepidoptera (butterflies, moths), Orthoptera (crickets, katydids, grasshoppers).</li></ul></li><li>Adult Blattodea and Diptera meet 6/8 criteria to a high or very high level of confidence, constituting strong evidence for pain (see Table 1, below). This is stronger evidence for pain than Birch et al. (2021) found for decapod crustaceans (5/8), which are currently protected via the UK Animal Welfare (Sentience) Act 2022.<ul><li>Adults of the remaining orders (except Coleoptera) and some juveniles (Blattodea, Diptera, and last juvenile stage Lepidoptera) satisfy 3 or 4 criteria, constituting substantial evidence for pain (see Tables 1 + 2).</li></ul></li><li>We found no good evidence that any insect failed a criterion.&nbsp;</li><li>For several criteria, evidence was distributed across the insect phylogeny (Figure 1), including across the major split between the hemimetabolous (incomplete metamorphosis) and holometabolous (complete metamorphosis) insects. This provides some reason to believe that certain kinds of evidence for pain (e.g., integrated nociception in adults) will be found in other taxa.</li></ul><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1669313960/mirroredImages/yPDXXxdeK9cgCfLwj/ka35krsfek4rhyjneyde.jpg\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yPDXXxdeK9cgCfLwj/soddxtynuq6icn31c446 590w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yPDXXxdeK9cgCfLwj/ty1iqmycw6fhxtspwogv 1180w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yPDXXxdeK9cgCfLwj/zeana6r8mfn2078pezne 1770w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yPDXXxdeK9cgCfLwj/xm35wn4nde2zjlj8bfv8 2360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yPDXXxdeK9cgCfLwj/wpc5gzinuv3fxixwuz11 2950w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yPDXXxdeK9cgCfLwj/t08cbnrknflyy9pabucp 3540w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yPDXXxdeK9cgCfLwj/ae01pnyryvlznkbwqsn9 4130w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yPDXXxdeK9cgCfLwj/mtl0mquhgvrswyuqhvnb 4720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yPDXXxdeK9cgCfLwj/hy49wwwrs66x34hluwue 5310w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/yPDXXxdeK9cgCfLwj/lehnkc1g7gmvjrlr0tqp 5848w\"><figcaption>Figure 1.

Often, individuals aligned with political movements do not realise that they are prioritising certain issues over others, or do not want to recognise this reality, because <strong>deeming some good causes less worthy than other good causes is deeply emotionally uncomfortable for most people</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>EAs are less uncomfortable with this because they are used to prioritisation, and <strong>prioritise between causes explicitly rather than implicitly.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>I think many liberal progressives focused on issues like student loan in Western countries do not recognise, or do not want to recognise, that they are prioritising this issue over vaccinating the world's poorest children against disease. However, EAs prioritising existential risks generally explicitly recognise and state that they are prioritising this over global health.&nbsp;</p><p>This leads some critics to a double standard of criticising those who explicitly prioritise issues over global health in favour of &nbsp;those who implicitly prioritise other issues over global health, despite the impacts on global health being the same.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Scope Insensitivity</strong></p><p>EAs are generally aware of scope insensitivity.&nbsp;</p><p>If asked to compare issues, it is likely that liberal progressives would at least agree that global health should in theory be prioritised over issues such as student loans or better healthcare for poorer Westerners. However, liberal progressives will likely still not prioritise pandemic preparedness and global health <i><strong>sufficiently</strong></i> even in theory, because of scope insensitivity and failures to understand the gulf in impact between initiatives focused on poorer Westerners vs the global poor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Differences in Priorities and Neglectedness</strong></p><p>Liberal progressivism is a much more successful ideology / movement than EA, in terms of reach and influence. EA claims to do the most good, but adherents of many ideologies and &nbsp;movements expect that they are doing the most good too, and are likely surprised when EA's cause priorities do not reflect their own. They may also simply &nbsp;critique EA out of disagreement between their priorities and EA's priorities.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>But EA priorities differing from the priorities of mainstream political movements is a systematic feature of EA, because EA focuses on neglected issues.</strong> If liberal progressivism or conservatism sufficiently prioritised AI safety, pandemic preparedness, global health or factory farming, there is a good chance that EA would switch to new priorities.&nbsp;</p><p>EA does not focus on the \"most important\" issues - it focuses on the issues where <strong>additional</strong> time or money will have the largest social impact.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Localism, Internationalism and Xenophobia</strong></p><p>My view of liberal progressivism is that it largely embraces localism with a preference for local resources being used to solve local problems by local actors.</p><p>However, the world is very unequal. The areas with the best resources and the most skilled actors to deploy them are also the areas with the least severe problems. The areas with the most severe problems have the fewest resources and the least skilled actors to deploy them. A preference for localism over internationalism would likely exacerbate international inequalities.&nbsp;</p><p>This contrasts with the internationalist view in EA, with distant resources being used to solve local problems via collaboration between distant actors and local actors, but usually with the distant resource-holders setting priorities based on what they believe will benefit locals the most using evidence and reasoning.</p><p>Localist views also implicitly devalue the lives of foreigners. I find that localist liberal progressives draw vivid, human images of beneficiaries of charity in western countries, while relegating foreign beneficiaries of charities to faceless statistics.&nbsp;</p><p>Cause priorities in Western liberal progressivism also implicitly place much lower value on the lives of foreigners than EA does - overseas development funding seems to be much lower down the list of priorities than student debt relief!</p><p>(As someone who spent their childhood in a middle income country, this deeply upsets me because it reminds me that some people on \"my side\" of the political spectrum would implicitly value my life a lot less had I not immigrated to the West.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Binary View of Conservatism vs Liberal Progressivism</strong></p><p>Some views on EA see it as a branch of political conservatism, since EA does not fit in neatly with liberal progressivism. I think this stems from viewing the world through a binary lens of liberal progressivism vs conservatism. Since EA doesn't seem like liberal progressivism, some people think it must be conservatism, and for people who dislike conservatism, EA must therefore be bad. This is despite EA significantly contributing to Biden's win in 2020.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Guilt by Association and Double Standards</strong></p><p>Effective altruism is associated with a lot of people. Under whatever definition of \"morally bad\" you have, <i>some</i> of those people are morally bad. Liberal progressives use EA's associations with Peter Thiel and Elon Musk to categorise EA as conservative. But of course, any influential ideology is associated with some morally bad people, including ideologies like socialism (the examples for socialism are obviously <i>way </i>worse than many other ideologies) and liberal progressivism. I think guilt by association is *generally* an unfair way to criticise a movement or ideology.</p><p><br><br>EDIT at 122 upvotes:</p><p><strong>White Saviourism</strong></p><p>I also think a poorly thought out view on white saviourism feeds into liberal progressivism\u2019s liking for localism.&nbsp;</p><p>I think this view is derived from concerns I share - that some white Westerners have done harm abroad while claiming to be doing good or aiming to do good, some white Westerners have used opportunities to do good abroad as a way to feel good about themselves rather than to benefit others and some white Westerners have cariacatured poor Africans and South Asians as lacking agency, which feeds into racism against black and brown people in Western countries.</p><p>I think some see localism as a solution to this problem, but because I think localism &nbsp;exacerbates international inequality and doesn\u2019t really tackle extreme poverty (which I think is a worse problem than white saviourism), I think EA style evidence-based development is a better solution.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Knowledge about International Inequality</strong></p><p>&nbsp;I think many liberal progressives are simply unaware of the <i>extent</i> of international wealth inequality, and may be surprised if they used Giving What We Can\u2019s \u201cHow Rich am I?\u201d calculator or used the Dollar Street tool on gapminder.com. I think EAs are much more aware of international inequality, so are more internationalist and less localist than liberal progressives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Better criticisms of EA from further to the political left coming soon!</p>", "user": {"username": "freedomandutility"}}, {"_id": "3kaojgsu6qy2n8TdC", "title": "Pre-Announcing the 2023 Open Philanthropy AI Worldviews Contest", "postedAt": "2022-11-21T21:45:26.028Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>[Update 3: The winners have been selected and notified and will be publicly announced no later than the end of September.]</i></p><p>[<i>Update 2: The contest has now officially launched!

So, what is the object of our study? There are many definitions of Existential Risk, including an<a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.pdf\"><u> irrecoverable loss of humanity's potential</u></a> or a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/Existential-risk-and-existential-hope.pdf\"><u>major loss of the expected value of the future,</u></a> both of these from essentially a transhumanist perspective. In this talk, however, I will be using Existential Risk in the broadest sense, taking my definition from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328719303313\"><u>Beard et al 2020</u></a>, with Existential Risk being risk that may result in the very worst catastrophes \u201cencompassing human extinction, civilizational collapse and any major catastrophe commonly associated with these things.\u201d</p><p>X-Risk is a risk, not an event. It is defined therefore by potentiality, and thus is inherently uncertain. We can thus clearly distinguish between different global and existential catastrophes (nuclear winters, pandemics) and drivers of existential risk, and there are no one to one mapping of these. The IPCC commonly, and helpfully, splits drivers of risk into hazards, vulnerabilities, exposures, and responses, and through this lens, it is clear that risk isn\u2019t something exogenous, but is reliant on decision making and governance failures, even if that failure is merely a failure of response.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The thesis I present here is not original, and draws on the work of a variety of thinkers, although I accept full blame for things that may be wrong. I will argue there are two different paradigms of studying X-Risk: a simple paradigm and a complex paradigm. I will argue that EA unfairly neglects the complex paradigm, and that this is dangerous if we want to have a complete understanding of X-Risk to be able to combat it. I am not suggesting the simple paradigm is \u201cwrong\u201d; but that alone it currently doesn\u2019t and&nbsp; never truly can, capture the full picture of X-Risk. I think the differences in the two paradigms of existential risk are diverse, with some of the differences being \u201cintellectual\u201d due to fundamentally different assumptions about the nature of the world we live in, and some are \u201ccultural\u201d which is more contingent on which thinkers works gain prominence. I won\u2019t really try and distinguish between these differences too hard, as I think this will make everything a bit too complicated. This presentation is merely a start, a challenge to the status quo, not asking for it to be torn down, but arguing for more epistemic and methodological pluralism. This call for pluralism is the core of my argument.&nbsp;</p><p>The \u201csimple\u201d paradigm of existential risk is at present dominant in EA-circles. It tends to assume that the best way to combat X-Risk is identify the most important hazards, find out the most tractable and neglected solutions to those, and work on that. It often takes a relatively narrow range of epistemic tools:&nbsp; <a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Improving-Judgments-of-Existential-Risk.pdf\">forecasting</a> and toy models, such as game theoretic approaches, thought experiments or well thought out \u201ckill mechanism\u201d <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Dod9AWz8Rp4Svdpof/why-i-think-there-s-a-one-in-six-chance-of-an-imminent\">causal chains</a>, as fundamentally useful tools at examining the future which is taken to be fundamentally understandable and to a degree predictable, if only we were rational enough and had enough information. Its a methodology that, given the relative lack of evidence on X-Risk, is more based on rationality than empiricism; a methodology that emerges more from analytic philosophy than empirical science. Thus, risks are typically treated quasi-independently, so the question&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theprecipice.com/faq#existential-risk\"><u>\u201cwhat is the biggest X-Risk\u201d</u></a> makes sense and we can approach X-Risk by focusing on quasi-discrete \u201ccause areas\u201d such as AGI, engineered pandemics or nuclear warfare.&nbsp;</p><p>Such an approach can be seen in published works by the community and in the assumptions that programmes and more are set up in.<a href=\"https://theprecipice.com/faq#existential-risk\"><u> The Precipice&nbsp;</u></a>finds the separation of X-Risks into the somewhat arbitrary categories of \u201cNatural\u201d \u201cAnthropogenic\u201d and \u201cFuture\u201d Risks to be useful, and quantifies those risks based on what each of those quasi-independent hazards contributes.&nbsp; The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cerifellowship.org/#causes\"><u>Cambridge Existential Risk Initiative</u></a> summer research fellowship that I was lucky to participate in this summer separated their fellows into categories based broadly on these separate, discrete risks: AI, Climate Change, Biosecurity, Nuclear Weapons and Misc+Meta. Once again, this promotes a siloed approach that sees these things as essentially independent, or at least treating these independently is the best way of understanding them. Even on the swapcard for this conference, there is no category for areas of interest for \u201cExistential Risk\u201d,&nbsp; \u201cVulnerabilities\u201d or \u201cSystemic Risk\u201d, whilst there is 2 categories for AI, a category for Nuclear Security, a category for climate change, a category for biosecurity. The \u201csimple\u201d approach to existential risk, permeates almost all the discussions we have in EA about existential risk; it is the sea in which we swim in. Thus, it profoundly affects the way we think about X-Risk. I think it could accurately be described as, in the sense&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lri.fr/~mbl/Stanford/CS477/papers/Kuhn-SSR-2ndEd.pdf\"><u>Kuhn discusses it</u></a>, as a paradigm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>That's the simple approach. A world, which at its core, we can understand. A world where the pathways to extinction are to some degree definable, identifiable, quantifiable. Or at least, if we are rational enough and research enough, we can understand what the most important X-Risks are,&nbsp; prioritise these and deal with these.&nbsp; Its no wonder that this paradigm has been attractive to Effective Altruists; this stuff is our bread and butter. The idea that we can use rational methodologies in good-doing is what we were founded on, and retains its power and strength through the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/itn-framework\"><u>ITN framework</u></a>. The problem is, I\u2019m not sure this is very good at capturing the whole picture of X-Risk, and we ignore the whole picture at our peril.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Because maybe the world isn\u2019t so simple, and the future not so predictable. Every facet of our society is increasingly interconnected, our ecological-climatic system coupling to our socio-economic system, global supply chains tied to our financial system tied to our food system. A future emerging from such complexity will be far from simple, or obvious, or predictable. Risk that threatens humanity in such a world will likely interact in emergent ways, or emerge in ways that are not predictable by simple analysis. Rather than predictable \u201ckill mechanisms,\u201d we might worry about tipping thresholds beyond which unsafe system transitions may occur, compounding, \u201csnowballing\u201d effects, worsening cascades,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328717301957\"><u>spread mechanisms</u></a> of collapse and where in a complex system we have the most leverage. Arguably, we can only get the whole picture by acknowledging irreducible complexity, and that the tools that we currently use to give us relatively well defined credences, and a sense of understanding and predictability in the future are woefully insufficient.&nbsp;</p><p>I think its important to note that my argument here is not \u201cthere is complexity therefore risk,\u201d but rather that the sort of global interconnected and interdependent systems that we have in place make the sorts of risk we are likely to face inherently unpredictable, and so it isn\u2019t so easily definable as the simple paradigm likes to make out. Even Ord acknowledges this unpredictability, putting the probability of \u201cunforseen anthropogenic risk\u201d at 1 in 30; in fact, whilst I have constantly attacked the core of Ords approach in this talk, I think he acknowledges many of these issues anyway.&nbsp; And its not like this approach, focusing on fuzzy mechanisms emerging out of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328720301646?via%3Dihub\"><u>feedback loops,</u></a> thresholds and tipping, is wholly foreign to EA; its arguable that the risk from AGI is motivated by the existence of a tipping threshold, which when past may lead to magnifying impacts in a positive feedback loop (the intelligence explosion), which will lead to unknown but probably very dangerous effects that, due to the complexity of all the systems involved, we probably can\u2019t predict. This is rarely dismissed as pure hand-wavyness as we acknowledge we are dealing with a system that our reasoning can\u2019t fully comprehend.&nbsp; Whilst EAs tend to utilise a few of the concepts of the complex approach with AGI, elsewhere its ignored, , which is slightly strange, but more on this later.</p><p>It is arguable that the complex paradigms focus on the complexity of the world is somewhat axiomatic, based on a different set of assumptions about the way the world functions to the simple approach; one that sees the world as a complex network of interconnected nodes, and risk as primarily emerging from the relatively well known fragility and vulnerability of such as system. I don\u2019t think I can fully prove this to you, because I think it is a fundamental worldview shift, not just a change in the facts, but in the way you experience and understand the world. However, if you want to be convinced, I would look at much of the literature on complexity, on the coupled socio-technical-ecological-political system, the literature on risk such as the IPCC, or texts like \u201c<a href=\"https://uk.sagepub.com/en-gb/eur/risk-society/book203184\"><u>the risk society</u></a>\u201d on how we conceptualise risk. I\u2019m happy to talk more about this in the Q&amp;A, but right now I hope that you're willing to come along for the ride even if you don\u2019t buy it.&nbsp;</p><p>This is why I treat this as an entirely different paradigm to the current EA paradigm. The complexity approach is fundamentally different. It sees the world as inherently complex, and whilst facets are understandable, at its core the system is so chaotic we can never fully or even nearly fully understand it. It sees the future as not just unpredictable but inherent undefined. It sees risk mostly emerging from our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328720300604\"><u>growing, fragile, interconnected system</u></a>, and typically sees existential hazards as only one part of the equation, with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0016328717301623\"><u>vulnerabilities ,exposures and responses</u></a>&nbsp; perhaps at least as important. It takes seriously our&nbsp; uncertainty with regards to what the topography of the epistemic landscape is, and so uncertainty should be baked into any understanding or approach, and thus favours <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lfPJ7Tz4JGs\">foresight over forecasting</a>. The epistemic tools that serve the simple approach are simply not useful at dealing with the complexity that this paradigm takes as central to X-Risk, and thus new epistemic tools and frameworks must be developed; whether these have been successful is debatable.</p><p>A defender of the \u201csimple\u201d paradigm might argue that this is unfair: after all, thinkers like Ord discuss \u201cdirect\u201d and \u201cindirect\u201d risks. This is helpful. The problem is, its very unclear what constitutes a \u201cdirect\u201d vs \u201cindirect\u201d existential risk. If a nuclear war kills almost everyone, but the last person alive trips off a rock and falls off a cliff, which was the direct existential risk? The nuclear war or the rock? Well, this example could rightfully be considered absurd (after all, if one person is alive, humanity will go extinct after that person dies) but I hope the idea still broadly stands- very few \u201cdirect\u201d existential risks actually wipe the last person out. What about a very deadly pandemic that can only spread due to the global system of international trade, and that the response of reducing transport, combined with climate change, causes major famines across the world, where only both combined cause collapse and extinction? Which is the direct risk? Suddenly, the risk stops looking so neat and simple, but still just as worrying.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This logic of direct and indirect doesn\u2019t work, because it still favours a quasi-linear mechanistic worldview. Often, something is only considered a \u201crisk factor\u201d if it leads to something that is a direct risk. Such arguments can be seen in<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BvNxD66sLeAT8u9Lv/climate-change-and-longtermism-new-book-length-report\"><u> John Halstead\u2019s enormous climate google doc</u></a>, which I think is a relatively good canonical example of the \u201csimple\u201d approach. Here, he argues climate change is not a large contributor to existential risk because it can\u2019t pose a direct risk, and isn\u2019t a major contributor to things that would then wipe us out. So its not a direct risk, nor a first order indirect risk; so its not really a major risk. In fact, because of the simplicity of merely needing to identify the answer to whether it is a direct risk or a 1st order indirect risk, there is not even a need for a methodology, or that slippery word \u201ctheory\u201d; one can merely answer the question by thinking about it and making a best guess. The type of system and causal chain dealt with is within the realm that one person can make such a judgement; if you acknowledge the complexity of the global network, such reliance on individual reasoning appears like dangerous overconfidence.&nbsp;</p><p>You might then say that the simple approach can still deal with issues by then looking at 2nd order indirect risks, 3rd order, 4th order and so on. But what happens when you get to nth order indirect risks; this mechanistic, predictable worldview simply cannot deal with that complexity. A reply to this may be that direct risks are just so much larger in expectation, however, this doesn\u2019t fit with our understanding from the study of&nbsp; complex and adaptive networks, and work done by scholars like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25021-8\"><u>Lara Mani&nbsp;</u></a>on volcanoes further show that cascading nth order impacts of volcanic eruptions may be far larger than the primary direct impacts. Even take the ship stuck in the suez canal- the ripple effects seem far larger than the initial, direct effect. This may similarly turn out the same for the long term impacts of COVID-19 as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Thus it seems the simple approach struggles when dealing with the ways most risks tend to manifest in the real, complex, interconnected world- through vulnerabilities and exposures, through systemic risks and through cascades. In fact, the simple approach tends to take Existential Risk to be synonymous with Existential Hazards, relegating other contributors to risk, like vulnerabilities, exposures and responses to the background. It has no real theory of systemic risk, hence the lack of need for defined methodologies,, and when I mentioned cascading risk to John Halstead in the context of his climate report, he said he simply didn\u2019t think it worth investigating. I don\u2019t think this is a problem with John- despite our disagreements he is an intelligent and meticulous scholar who put a lot of effort into that report; I think this is a problem of simple existential risk analysis- it is not capable of handling the complexity of the real world.&nbsp;</p><p>So we need complex risk analysis, that acknowledges the deep interconnectedness, emergence and complexity of the global system we are in to truly analyse risk. But here we are faced with a dilemma. On the one hand, we have a recognition as to the irreducible complexity of the world, and the inherent uncertainty of the future. On the other, we need to act within this system and understand the risks so we can combat them. So the question is, how?</p><p>The first step towards a more complex risk analysis picks up the baton from the simple approach, in emphasising compounding risk; how different hazards interact. More will be discussed on this later.</p><p>Secondly, risk is expanded beyond the concept of existential hazards, which is what the simple paradigm focuses on, to discuss vulnerabilities and exposures, as well as responses. To explain vulnerabilities and exposures, imagine someone with a peanut allergy: the peanut is the hazard, the allergy the vulnerability and the exposure is being in the same room as the peanut. The hazard is what kills you, the vulnerability is how you die, and the exposure is the interface between the two. So we can expand what we should do to combat existential risk from just \u201cputting out fires\u201d which is what the hazard-centric approach focuses on, to a more systemic approach focusing on making our overall system more resilient to existential risk. We might identify key nodes where systemic failure could occur, and try and increase their resilience, such as the work<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25021-8\"><u> Lara Mani&nbsp;</u></a>has been doing identifying global pinch points where small magnitude volcanic eruptions may cause cascading impacts resulting in a global catastrophe.&nbsp;</p><p>In doing this, we are abandoning the nice, neat categories the simple approach creates. In many ways, it no longer makes sense to talk about risks, as though these were quasi-independent \u201cfires\u201d to put out. Rather, it makes sense to speak about contributors to overall risk, with attempts made to shift the system to greater security, by identifying and reducing sources of risk. This doesn\u2019t just include hazards, but other contributors as well; not just acknowledging the initial effect, but everything that made each cascade more likely. These&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2108146119\"><u>cascades&nbsp;</u></a>are not predictable, the threshold beyond which the feedback loop occurs not knowable, and thus <a href=\"https://www.cser.ac.uk/resources/foresight-unknown-long-term-and-emerging-risks-approaches-and-recommendations/\">foresight</a>, where we may get a sample of what could occur, rather than forecasting where we try and predict what will occur, will be far more useful.&nbsp; This simple linguistic shift, from risks to risk, can be surprisingly powerful at highlighting the difference between the simple and complex approach.&nbsp;</p><p>Acknowledging that we don\u2019t know the pathways to extinction actually opens up new approaches to combatting risk. We may see reducing systemic vulnerability as more impactful than under the simple approach.&nbsp; see reducing the probability of feedbacks and of passing thresholds beyond which we may reasonably assume catastrophe may follow as appropriate courses of action. Or, even if we are unsure about what exactly will kill us, we might want to focus on what is driving risk in general rather than specific hazards, be it work on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20211014-agents-of-doom-who-is-hastening-the-apocalypse-and-why\"><u>\"agents of doom\"</u></a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/papers/vulnerable.pdf\"><u>Bostrom's vulnerable work</u></a> emerging out of a semi anarchic default condition. Whilst the complex approach acknowledges the difficulties that the nonlinearities and complexities bring, in other ways it allows for a broader repertoire of responses to risk as well, as&nbsp; <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1758-5899.12786\"><u>Cotton Barrett et als</u></a> work on defence in depth also shows, for example.</p><p>Another approach to&nbsp; complexity may be what might be called the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gcrinstitute.org/papers/011_planetary-boundaries.pdf\"><u>\u201cPlanetary Boundaries\u201d&nbsp;</u></a>approach. Here, we identify thresholds whereby we know the system is safe, and try to avoid crossing into the unknown. Its like we\u2019re at the edge of a dark forest; it may be safe to walk in, but better safe than sorry. It applies a precautionary principle; that in such a complex system, we should have the epistemic humility to simply say \u201cbetter the devil you know.\u201d&nbsp; This approach has rightfully been critiqued by many who tend to favour a more \u201csimple\u201d approach; it is very handwavy, with no clear mechanism to extinction or even collapse, with the boundaries chosen somewhat arbitrarily. Nevertheless, it may argued that lines had to be drawn somewhere, and wherever they would be drawn would be arbitrary; so this is a \u201cplay it safe\u201d approach because we don\u2019t know what is beyond these points rather than an \u201cavoid knowable catastrophe approach.\u201d However, such an approach is very problematic if we want to prioritise between approaches, something I will briefly discuss later.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Something similar could be said as a solution to Bostrom\u2019s \u201cVulnerable World\u201d and Manheim\u2019s \u201cFragile World.\u201d If increasing technological development and complexity puts us in danger, then maybe we should take every effort to stop this; after all, these things are not inevitable. Of course, Bostrom would never accept this- to him this alone poses an X-Risk- and instead proposes a global surveillance state, but that is slightly besides the point.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>However, we are still&nbsp; faced with a number of problems. We are constantly moving into unprecedented territory.&nbsp; And sometimes, we are not left with an option which is nice and without tradeoffs.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://whatweowethefuture.com/uk/\"><u>MacAskill&nbsp;</u></a>somewhat successfully argues that technological stagnation would still leave us at danger of many threats.&nbsp; Sometimes we have already gone in the forest, and we can hear howling, and we have no idea what is going on, and we are posed with a choice of things to do, but no option is safe. We are stuck between a rock and a hard place. Under such deep uncertainty, how can we act if we refuse to reduce the complexity of the world? We can\u2019t just play it safe, because every option fails a precautionary principle. What do we do in such cases?</p><p>This is the exact dilemma that faces me in my research. I\u2019m researching the interactions of solar radiation modification and existential risk, both how it increases and decreases risk. As it is therefore simultaneously combatting a source of risk, and itself increases risk, the sort of \u201cplay it safe\u201d approach to complexity just doesn\u2019t necessarily work, although before I properly explain how I am attempting to unpick this, I ought to explain exactly what I\u2019m on about.</p><p>Solar Radiation Modification (SRM), otherwise known as solar geoengineering is a set of technologies that aim to reflect a small amount of sunlight to reduce warming. Sunlight enters the earth, some is reflected. That which isn\u2019t is absorbed by the earth, which is then reemitted as long wave infrared radiation. Some of this escapes to space, and some gets absorbed by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, warming it. As we increase GHG concentrations, we increase the warming. SRM tries to reduce this warming by decreasing the amount of light entering the earth, by reflecting it by either injecting aerosols into the stratosphere, mimicing the natural effects of volcanos, or by brightening clouds, or a related technique that isn\u2019t quite the same that involves thinning other clouds. This would likely reduce temperatures globally, and the climate would be generally closer to preindustrial, but it comes with its own risks that may make it more dangerous</p><p>Those working from a simple paradigm have tended to reject risks from climate change as especially large. Toby Ord estimates the risk at 0.1%.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://whatweowethefuture.com/uk/\"><u>Will MacAskill</u></a> in what we owe the future suggests \u201cits hard to see how even [7-10 degrees of warming] could cause collapse.\u201d Both of these have tended to use proxies for what would cause collapse, trying their best to come up with simple, linear models of catastrophe; Toby Ord wants to look at whether heat stress will cause the world to become uninhabitable, and Will wants to look at whether global agriculture will entirely collapse. These simple proxies, whilst making it easier to reason simple causal chains, are just not demonstrative of how risk manifests. Some have then attempted to argue whether climate change poses a first order indirect existential risk, which is mostly John Halstead\u2019s approach in his climate report, but once again, I think this misses the point.&nbsp;</p><p>From a more complex paradigm, I think climate change becomes something to be taken more seriously, because not only does it make hazards more likely, and stunts our responses, but also, and perhaps more keenly, makes us more vulnerable, and may act to majorly compound risk in ways that make catastrophe far more likely. A variety of these scenarios where a \u201cone hazard to kill us all\u201d approach doesn\u2019t work was explored in the recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2108146119\"><u>\u201cClimate Endgame\u201d</u></a> paper. One area where that paper strongly disagrees with the status quo is via \u201csystemic risk.\u201d In the Precipice, Ord argues that a single risk is more likely than two or more occurring in unison, however, Climate Endgame explores how climate change has the ability to trigger widespread, synchronous, systemic failure via multiple indirect stressors: food system failures, economic damage, water insecurity etc coalescing and reinforcing until you get system wide failure. A similar, but slightly different risk, is that of a cascade, with vulnerabilities increasing until one failure sets off another, and another, with the whole system snowballing; in the case of climate, this may not just refer to our socio-economic system, but evidence of tipping cascades in the physical system show that there is a non-negligable chance of major near synchronous collapse of major elements in the earth system. Such spread of risk is well documented in the literature, as occurred in the 2008 financial crisis, but has been almost entirely neglected by the simple paradigm of existential risk.&nbsp; The ability for such reinforcing, systemic risk to occur from initial hazards that are far smaller than the simple paradigm would consider \u201ccatastrophic\u201d should really worry us: normally, lower magnitude hazards are more common, and we are likely severely neglecting these. If one takes such systemic failures seriously, climate change suddenly looks a lot more dangerous than the simple approach lets it be.</p><p>So, a technology like SRM that can reduce climate damage may seriously reduce the risk of catastrophe. There is a significant amount of evidence to suggest that SRM moderates climate impacts at relatively \u201cmedian\u201d levels of warming. However, one thing that has hardly been explored is the capacity of SRM to combat hitting those earth tipping thresholds, which, whilst not essential to have the spreading systemic risk, is certainly one key contributor to existential risk from climate change being higher. So, alongside some colleagues at Utrecht and Exeter, we are starting to investigate the literature, models and expert elicitations to try and make a start at understanding this question. So, this is one way one can deal with complexity: try and make a start with things which we know contribute to systemic risk in ways that could plausibly be catastrophic, and observe whether these can be reduced.</p><p>However, SRM also acts as a contributor to risk. In one sense, this contributor to risk is easier to understand from the simple paradigm, as it is its direct contribution to great power conflict, which is often itself considered a first order indirect risk. So here we can perhaps agree! This has been explored in many peoples work, some just simple, two variable analyses of the interaction of SRM and volcanic hazards, whilst some try and highlight how SRM may change geopolitics and tensions in a way which may change how other risk spreads and compounds. One key way it does this is by coupling our geopolitical-socio-political system with the ecological-climatic system, allowing for risk to spread from our human system to the climatic system that supports us much faster than before. This might really worry us, given how our climatic system then feeds back into our human system and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>A second manner which it contributes is by the so-called<a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fclim.2021.720312/full\"> latent risk</a>- a risk that lays \u201cdormant\u201d until activated. Here, if you stop carrying out SRM, you get rapid warming, what is often called \u201ctermination shock\u201d, and faster rates of warming likely raise risk through all the pathways discussed for climate change. However, to add another wrinkle, such termination is mostly plausible because of another global catastrophe, so what would occur is what Seth Baum calls&nbsp; a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3640777\"><u>\u201cDouble Catastrophe\u201d</u></a>- again highlighting how synchronous failure might be more likely than single failure! However, to get a better understanding of the physical effects of such double catastrophe under different conditions, I have been exploring how SRM would interact with another catastrophe that had climatic effects, namely a catastrophe involving the injection of soot into the stratosphere after a nuclear exchange. Here, its very unclear that the \u201ctermination shock\u201d and the other effects of SRM actually make the impacts of such an exchange worse, and it is likely that actually it acts to slightly moderate the effects. I think this shows we cannot simply go \u201cinteracting hazards and complex risk = definitely worse,\u201d but I also think it shows that the neglect of such complex risk by the simple approach loses a hell of a lot of the picture.</p><p>The other thing I am trying to explore is the plausible cascades and spread mechanisms of risk which SRM encourages. In part, I am doing this through foresight exercises like ParEvo, where experts are brought together to generate collaborative and creative storylines of diverging futures. Unlike forecasting, such scenarios don\u2019t have probabilities on them; in fact, due to the specificity needed, a good scenario should have a probability zero, like a point on a probability distribution, but hopefully can give us a little bit of a map with what could occur. So we highlight a whole load of plausible scenarios, acknowledging that none of these are likely to come to fruition, but hopefully on the premise that these should perhaps highlight some of the key areas in which good action should focus. For example, my scenarios will be focusing on different SRM governance schemes response to different catastrophic shocks, so hopefully highlighting common failures of governance systems to more heavy tailed shocks. Scenarios are useful in many other areas, such as the use of more \u201cgame-like\u201d scenarios such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://intelligencerising.org/\"><u>Intelligence Rising</u></a> to highlight the interactions of the development of AGI and international tensions and geopolitics.&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, ultimately what is needed is to do a risk-risk-risk-risk-risk analysis, comparing the ways SRM reduces and contributes to risk, and what leverage could be to reduce each of those contributors. This is a way off, and I am unsure if we have good methodologies for this yet. Nonetheless, by acknowledging the large complexities, and utilising methods to uncover how SRM can contribute to risk and reduce risk in the global interconnected system, we get a far better picture of the risk landscape than under the simple approach. Many who take the simple approach have been quite happy to reject SRM as a risky technology without major benefit in mitigating X-Risk, and have been happy to do a \u201cquick and dirty\u201d risk-risk analysis based on simple models of how risk propagate. As we explore the more complex feedbacks, interactions and cascades of risk, the validity of such simple analyses is, I think, brought into question, highlighting the need for the complex paradigm in this field.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, its important to note that it is not obvious how any given upstream action, like research for example, contributes to risk. Even doing research helps to rearrange the risk landscape in unpredictable ways, and so even answering of whether research makes deployment of the technology more likely is really hard, as research spurs governance, impacts tensions, impacts our ability to discover different technologies and make the system more resilient etc. Once again, the complex web of impacts of research also need to be untangled. This is tricky, and needs to be done very carefully. But given EA dominates the X-Risk space, its not something we can shirk doing.&nbsp;</p><p>I also think its important to note that these approaches, whilst working often from different intellectual assumptions, have their differences manifest predominantly culturally rather than intellectually. In many ways, the two approaches converge; this is perhaps surprising, and maybe acts as a caution against my grandsstanding of fundamental axiomatic differences. For example, the worry about an intelligence explosion is at its core, I think, a worry about a threshold beyond which we move into a dangerous unknown, with systems smarter than us who may, likely by some unknown mechanism, kill us. In many ways, it should be more comfortable inside the \u201ccomplex\u201d paradigm, without well thought out kill mechanism, acknowledging irreducable undetermination of the future, and how powerful technologies, phenomena and structures within our complex interconnected system are likely to contribute hugely to risk, than in the simple paradigm. Similarly, work that thinkers like Luke Kemp, who ostensibly aligns more with the \u201ccomplex paradigm\u201d have done on the agents of doom, which tries to identify the key actors that are drivers of risk, which is mostly the drivers of hazards, probably fits more neatly in the \u201csimple\u201d paradigm than the complex paradigm. I think these cultural splits are important as well, and it probably implies that a lot of us from across the spectrum are missing potentially important contributors to existential risk, irrespective of our paradigm.</p><p>As a coda to this talk, I would like to briefly summarise Adrian Currie\u2019s arguments in his wonderful paper<a href=\"https://intelligencerising.org/\"><u> \u201cExistential Risk, Creativity and Well Adapted Science.\u201d</u></a> This is relevant perhaps a level above what I am talking about, arguing about what \u201cmeta-paradigm\u201d we should take. He suggests that all research has a topographical landscape with \u201cpeaks\u201d representing important findings. Thus, research is a trade-off between exploring and exploiting this landscape. I think the simple approach is very good at exploiting certain peaks, but is particularly bad at understanding the topography of the whole landscape, which I think the complexity paradigm is much better at. But as Currie convincingly argues, this probably isn\u2019t sufficient. X-Risk studies is in a relatively novel epistemic situation: the risks they deal with are unique, in the words of Carl Sagan&nbsp;<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/manchester-scholarship-online/book/30396/chapter/257469619\"><u>\u201cnot readily amenable to experimental verification\u2026 at least not more than once.\u201d</u></a> The systems are wild and thus don\u2019t favour systemic understanding. We are not just uncertain as to the answer to key questions, but also uncertain as to what to ask. It is a crisis field, centred around a goal rather than a discipline- in fact, we are uncertain what disciplines matter the most. All of this leaves us in an epistemic situation where in many ways uncertainty, and thus creativity, should be at the core of our approach, both trying to get an understanding of the topography of the landscape and because it stops us getting siloed. On the spectrum of exploring vs exploiting, exploratory approaches should be favoured, because we should reasonably see ourselves as deeply uncertain about nearly everything in X-Risk. Even if people haven\u2019t managed to \u201cchange our minds\u201d on a contributor to risk, experience should tell us that we are likely to be wrong in ways that no one yet understands, and there are quite probably even bigger peaks out there. We also should be methodological omnivores, happy to use many methodologies and tailoring these to local contexts, and with a pluralistic approach to techniques and evidence, increasing the epistemic tools at our disposal. Both of these imply the need for pluralism, rather than hegemony of any one approach. I am very worried that EAs culture and financial resources are pushing us away from creativity and towards conservatism in the X-RIsk space.&nbsp;</p><p>In conclusion, this talk hasn\u2019t shown you the simple approach is wrong, just that it provides a thoroughly incomplete picture of the world that is insufficient at dealing with the complexity of many drivers of existential risk. This is why I, and many others, call for greater methodological diversity and pluralism, including a concerted effort to come up with better approaches to complex and systemic risk. The simple approach is clearly problematic, but it is far easier to make progress on problems using it- its like the Newtonian physics of existential risk studies. But to get a more complete picture of the field, we need a more complex approach.&nbsp; Anders Sandberg put this nicely, seeing the \u201crisk network\u201d as having a deeply interconnected core, where the approach of irreducable complexity must dominate, a periphery which has less connections, where a compounding risk approach can dominate, and a far off periphery where the simple, hazard centric approaches dominate with relatively few connections between hazards. The question is, and one that is probably axiomatic more than anything else, where the greatest source of risk is. But both methods of analysis clearly have their place.&nbsp;</p><p>As EA dominates the existential risk field, it is our responsibility to promote pluralism, through our discourses and our funding. Note, as a final thing, this isn\u2019t the same as openness to criticism, based on \u201cchange my mind\u201d around a set of rules which a narrow range of funders and community leaders set. Rather, we need pluralism, where ideas around existential risk coexist rather than compete, encouraging exploration and creativity, and, in the terms of Adrian Currie, \u201cmethodological omnivory.\u201d There is so little evidentiary feedback loops that a lot of our answers to methodological or quasi-descriptive questions tends to be based on our prior assumptions, as there often isn\u2019t enough evidence to hugely shift these, or evidence can be explained in multiple ways. This means our values and assumptions hugely impact everything, so having a very small group of thinkers and funders dominate and dictate the direction of the field is dangerous, essentially no matter how intelligent and rational we think they are. So we need to be willing not just to tolerate but fund and promote work into X-Risk that we individually may think is a dead-end, and cede power to increase the creativity possible in the field,&nbsp; because in such uncertainty, promoting creativity and diversity is the correct approach, as hard as it is to accept this. How we square this circle with our ethos of prioritisation and effectiveness is a very difficult question, one I don\u2019t have the answer to. Maybe its not possible; but EAs seem to be very good at expanding the definition of what is possible in combatting the world\u2019s biggest problems. This a question that we must pose, or we risk trillions of future lives.

Intro</h1><p>Two weeks ago, I was in the process of writing a different essay. Instead, I\u2019ll touch on FTX, and make the following claims.&nbsp;</p><ol><li>I think \u2018the principles of EA\u2019 are, at the community level, indeterminate in important ways. This makes me feel uncertain about the degree to which we can legitimately make statements of the form: \u201cSBF violated EA principles\u201d.&nbsp;</li><li>The&nbsp;<i>longtermist</i> community \u2014 despite not having a set of explicit, widely agreed upon, and determinate set of deontic norms<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6xvpx1sblo7\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6xvpx1sblo7\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;\u2014 nevertheless contains a distinctive set of more implicit norms, which I believe are worth preserving at the community level. I thus suggest an alternative self-conception for the longtermist community, centered on striving towards a certain set of moral-cum-epistemic virtues.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Section 2 discusses the first claim, and Section 3 discusses the second. Each chunk can probably be read independently, though I\u2019d like it if you read them both.</p><h1>2. 'EA Principles\u2019</h1><p>This section will criticize some of the comments in Will\u2019s tweet thread, published in the aftermath of FTX\u2019s collapse.&nbsp;</p><p>I want to say that, while I\u2019ll criticize some of Will\u2019s remarks, I recognize that expressing yourself well under conditions of emotional stress is really,&nbsp;<i>really</i> hard. Despite this difficulty, I imagine that Will nevertheless felt he had to say&nbsp;<i>something</i>, and&nbsp;<i>quickly</i>. So, while I stand behind my criticism, I hope that my criticism can be viewed as an attempt to live up to ideals I think Will and I both share \u2014 of frank intellectual honesty, in service of a better world.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>2.1.</p></blockquote><p>From Will\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/willmacaskill/status/1591218024190971904\"><u>response</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cIf those involved deceived others and engaged in fraud (whether illegal or not) that may cost many thousands of people their savings,&nbsp;<strong>they entirely abandoned the principles of the effective altruism community</strong>.\u201d (emphasis mine)</p></blockquote><p>Overall, I\u2019m not convinced. In his tweet thread, Will cites various sources \u2014 one of which is Holden\u2019s <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/T975ydo3mx8onH3iS/ea-is-about-maximization-and-maximization-is-perilous\">post</a> on the dangers of maximization, in which Holden makes the following claim:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI think \u201cdo the most good possible\u201d is an \u2026 important idea \u2026 but it\u2019s also a perilous idea if taken too far \u2026 Fortunately, I think EA mostly resists [the perils of maximization] \u2013 but that\u2019s due to the good judgment and general anti-radicalism of the human beings involved, not because the ideas/themes/memes themselves offer enough guidance on how to avoid the pitfalls.\u201d&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>According to Holden, one of EA\u2019s \u201ccore ideas\u201d is a concern with&nbsp;<i>maximization</i>. And he thinks that the primary way in which EA avoids the pitfalls of their code ideas is through being tempered by moderating forces external to the core ideas themselves. If we&nbsp;<i>weren\u2019t</i> tempered by moderating forces, Holden claims that:</p><p><strong>We\u2019d have a community full of low-integrity people, and \u201cbad people\u201d as most people define it.</strong></p><p>Here\u2019s one (to me natural) reading of Holden\u2019s post, in light of the FTX debacle. SBF was a risk-neutral Benthamite, who describes his own <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/sam-bankman-fried-high-risk-approach-to-crypto-and-doing-good/#taking-a-high-risk-approach-to-doing-good-000610\">motivations in founding FTX</a> as the result of a risky, but positive expected value bet done in service of the greater good. And, indeed, there are other examples of Sam being really quite unusually committed to this <a href=\"https://twitter.com/breakingthemark/status/1591114381508558849\">risk-neutral</a>, <a href=\"https://conversationswithtyler.com/episodes/sam-bankman-fried/\">Benthamite</a> way of approaching decisions. In light of this, one may think that Sam\u2019s decision to deceive and commit fraud may well have been&nbsp;<i>more</i> in keeping with an attempt to meet the core EA idea of explicit maximization, even if his attempt was poorly executed. On this reading, Sam\u2019s fault may not have consisted in abandoning the principles of the EA community. Instead, his failings may have arisen from the absence of&nbsp;<i>normal</i>&nbsp;<i>moderating forces</i>, which are external to EA ideas themselves.</p><p>Recall Will\u2019s statement: he claimed that, conditional on Sam committing fraud, Sam \u201centirely abandoned the principles of the effective altruism community\u201d. I think this statement gets at&nbsp;<i>something</i>, because most individual EAs certainly did condemn Sam\u2019s actions. But I think that the evidence garnered from our community\u2019s reaction fails to constitute straightforward support for Will\u2019s claims. After all, people may be condemning Sam from the perspective of felt sentiments external to EA principles, rather than ideas that come directly from EA principles themselves.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>2.2.</p></blockquote><p>In&nbsp;<i>What We Owe The Future</i>, Will highlights the importance of deontological side-constraints, for both practical and instrumental reasons. In&nbsp;<i>The Precipice</i>, Ord highlights the importance of integrity. CEA extol the importance of honesty and trust. Given all this, it might seem natural to maintain that Sam violated EA principles, by unduly focusing on one narrow feature of EA \u2014 the underrated benefits of explicit maximization \u2014 while neglecting other principles, which are&nbsp;<i>also</i> core to EA.&nbsp;</p><p>And, well, maybe. I can certainly imagine being convinced of this. But I think it\u2019s a hard question, in part because EA contains far more explicit utilitarians than any other social group I\u2019m aware of, alongside many people who endorse deontological theories which, given large enough stakes (as many longtermists suppose we face) start to look very utilitarian. And at least some of us believe, along with Holden, that it\u2019s \u201cextremely uncertain and debatable what utilitarianism says about a given decision, especially from a longtermist point of view\u201d. Maybe Holden is wrong, and utilitarian-ish theories (including utilitarianism itself) actually <i>do</i> provide clear verdicts on the practical wrongness of violating side-constraints.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, I bring up Holden's comments because I think my intuition says something like: \u201cto claim that someone violates the principles of some community, that action has to both: (1) clearly violate said principles, and (2) for such principles to be near-unanimously agreed upon\u201d.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>2.3.</p></blockquote><p>Here's an example to motivate my intuition: Suppose you're entering your garden, on the way back home from school, just in time for dinner with your upper class family in Victorian England. As always, you see observe the motto inscribed beneath your family crest: \"act with virtue\".&nbsp;</p><p>You walk inside. Dad's shouting. He's furious, after learning that you've been supporting the Suffragettes. \"You've failed to live up to the family standards\", he tells you. You object, pointing out the fierceness of your late grandma, and what she would've wanted. Your Dad says she doesn't get a vote; in any case, he points out that all your current family agree with <i>him</i>. He points out that various members of the family forum have really quite publicly said that women should be modest, and attempting to storm parliament <i>certainly isn't modest</i>. You protest, again, that many in your lineage are advocates of equal rights \u2014 and equal treatment is a virtue, or so you claim.&nbsp;</p><p>You argue for hours, until you're expelled from the house, and told to never return. As you leave, your father tells you that you've disgraced the family principles. <i>Was he right?</i> &nbsp;Who was <i>actually</i> living up to the family motto?</p><p>Here, I'm tempted to say that the motto is just too vague to license a determinate answer. The family members disagree with your actions, but you really do think that the Suffragettes are virtuous. And how is one meant to adjudicate this dispute? How does one act with virtue? I mean, it's a vague term! Many people disagree on what it implies! To the extent that your family does unilaterally disagree with your actions, I'd take that as a sign that your 'Family Principles' were previously too vague, not that you determinately violated them.&nbsp;</p><p>Back to EA: consequentialism is a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/wtQ3XCL35uxjXpwjE/ea-survey-2019-series-community-demographics-and#Morality\">majority view within EA</a>, and its implications with respect to respecting common sense moral norms appear at least&nbsp;<i>controversial</i>, especially from a longtermist point of view. Sam was a known, committed consequentialist, who may have been attempting to make decisions in an explicitly consequentialist way. Thus, claims to the effect of \u2018Sam\u2019s actions violated EA principles\u2019 feel too strong. Sam\u2019s actions were obviously not&nbsp;<i>required</i> &nbsp;by EA principles, but nor am I confident that, at least before&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XHrHsrQGyr4NnqCA7/we-must-be-very-clear-fraud-in-the-service-of-effective\"><u>this post</u></a>, we\u2019d have had firm ground to say that fraud was&nbsp;<i>condemned </i>by EA principles.</p><blockquote><p>2.3.</p></blockquote><p>As you leave your house, you decided to read the family motto one last time. But, <i>huh</i>, you notice that it's different now. It reads:</p><blockquote><p>Effective altruism is:</p><ol><li>The use of evidence and careful reasoning to work out how to maximize the good with a given unit of resources, tentatively understanding \u2018the good\u2019 in impartial welfarist terms, and</li><li>The use of the findings from (1) to try to improve the world</li></ol></blockquote><p>You remember that you're not a Victorian child, after all. You wake up. You realize that you fell asleep while reading Will MacAskill's '<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rQu75k8uMFpdsp1y3JWlHP6kev3T-97N/view\">The Definition of Effective Altruism</a>'.</p><p>I think reflecting on the definition of EA given by Will further highlights the difficulties involved in interpreting claims about fraud \u201cabandoning the principles of EA\u201d. Note that the definition is, as Will points out,&nbsp;<i>non-normative</i>. It doesn\u2019t explicitly tell you what you ought to do. Moreover, EA contains a large community of people who endorse utilitarianism, or other unusual theories, which many people seem to think deliver unclear verdicts for action. Also Sam really did seem, at least in part, to be trying to maximize his wealth in order to maximize his impact.&nbsp;</p><p>So, did Sam violate EA principles? In light of this discussion, I think the right answer, as with the Suffragette example, is: <i>it\u2019s indeterminate</i>.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>2.4.</p></blockquote><p>I think it's correct to say 'it\u2019s indeterminate', rather than 'no\u2019, because our agreed upon standards for what counts as \u2018careful reasoning\u2019 in the domain of practical action clearly provide some precedent for denouncing things like fraud. We've already mentioned Will, CEA, and Toby's statements to this effect. Joining the crowd, we have Stefan and Lucius, who have previously listed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.utilitarianism.net/guest-essays/virtues-for-real-world-utilitarians#8-utilitarianism-and-common-sense-virtues\"><u>honesty</u></a> (among others) as an important virtue for real-world utilitarians, and Richard Yetter-Chappell, a utilitarian and prominent member of EA, who has <a href=\"https://www.philosophyetc.net/2005/06/indirect-utilitarianism.html\">long maintained</a> that utilitarians should be \"honest, compassionate, loyal, trustworthy, averse to harming others .... &nbsp;in other words, [we should] be virtuous rather than scheming\". (This is not exhaustive, of course, they're just posts that I remember)</p><p>So: many key figures in EA have long said (or implied) that performing explicit consequentialist calculations when considering a given action is sometimes incompatible with actually reasoning \u2018carefully\u2019, because such reasoning, for whatever reason, is unlikely to be a fruitful way of improving the world in the way you\u2019d like.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, I think our principles are vague enough that we can't straightforwardly point to fraud, in Sam's case, and say that it violated EA principles. Even if Sam's actions violated certain deontic side-constraints, it's sometimes <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wz8lgjBLTpI&amp;t=2928s&amp;ab_channel=GlobalPrioritiesInstitute-UniversityofOxford\">pointed out </a>(correctly!) that various deontological theories start to look very consequentialist as the stakes get higher. Also, given Sam's financial influence, he may well have believed that side-constraint violations are \"almost always wrong\", but, given his legitimately unusual position, that he existed in one of the few cases where side-constraint violations <i>really</i> <i>would</i> &nbsp;be for the greater (expected) good. &nbsp;Of course, I don't actually know what Sam was thinking. But, given that I don't know, I don't feel confident saying that his decision procedure, whatever it may have been, was out of keeping with EA principles.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>2.5.</p></blockquote><p>In his post-FTX tweet thread, Will also called for EAs to \u2018<a href=\"https://twitter.com/willmacaskill/status/1591218059246587904\">not see ourselves as above common sense moral norms</a>\u2019. Here, I read Will as attempting to take a stand on what the EA movement ought to stand for, and I share that interest. But I feel hesitant about championing the importance of \u2018common sense morality\u2019, for reasons alluded to by <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/11/is-the-ea-movement-dead.html\">Tyler Cowen</a>.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\u201cGrandma, in her attachment to common sense morality, is not telling you to fly to Africa to save the starving children (though you should finish everything on your plate).&nbsp; Nor would she sign off on Singer (1972).\u201d</p></blockquote><p>In a month\u2019s time, I\u2019ll visit my family for Christmas, and (as per usual) I\u2019ll insist on eating only vegan food. Now, I might be wrong to do this. But telling me that my insistence violates \u201ccommon sense morality\u201d is not enough (nor do I think it&nbsp;<i>should&nbsp;</i>be enough) to convince me. \u201cCommon sense morality\u201d is a nebulous concept, some parts which are in obvious conflicts with virtues I believe to be important. I think this is true for most of us. In many ways, we strive to be (in Will\u2019s words)&nbsp;<i>moral weirdos</i>, and&nbsp;<i>moral entrepreneurs</i>.</p><p>Hence, I\u2019m cautious about statements emphasizing the importance of common sense morality for two reasons. Firstly, because of the vagueness. Also, secondly, because I don\u2019t think statements generically highlighting the importance of common sense morality are in tension with other features of the community\u2019s self-conception \u2014 at least in the absence of further work outlining what, exactly, we're deferring to when we defer to \u2018common sense morality\u2019.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, I can easily see how someone might look at public claims about the importance that EA ought to place on \u2018common sense morality\u2019 and come to believe \u2014 <i>somewhat justifiably, even if incorrectly </i>\u2014 that such statements amount to little more than PR. If we are to champion certain&nbsp;<i>components</i> of common sense morality, then I think we need to be explicit about what those features are, and how our commitment to those features fit neatly and coherently with the rest of our self-conception.</p><h1>3. Virtues and \u2018The Longtermist Community\u2019</h1><p><i>(Note: The following discussion is more specific to longtermist EA, rather than EA generally)</i></p><p>If the EA community\u2019s principles are as indeterminate as I am claiming, one might start to feel sympathy with David Manheim\u2019s <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/56CHyqoZskFejWgae/ea-is-a-global-community-but-should-it-be\">recent post</a>. David argues that we should move away from the idea of EA as a&nbsp;<i>community</i>. I reject this claim. Or, at least, I think that there ought to be a&nbsp;<i>longtermist</i> community. <i>(I\u2019m making this restricted claim, because it\u2019s the side of EA which has taken up most of my recent involvement).</i></p><p>I think the longtermist community \u2014 viewed&nbsp;<i>sociologically</i>, as a community of people striving to embody certain moral and epistemic norms \u2014 has something going for it. And I think something would be lost if the community fragmented, leaving only individual groups working in specific cause areas. The longtermist community is united, I think, by its commitment to an unusual set of norms \u2014 norms that, despite being in many ways&nbsp;<i>implicit</i>, govern how we approach moral and practical reasoning. These norms help to form a shared set of (again, partially implicit) guidelines, and provide thinking tools used to&nbsp;<i>inform</i> people\u2019s decisions to silo into different focus areas.&nbsp;</p><p>The longtermist community has value, I think, in virtue of the unusual norms which govern the way in which its members (aspire to) approach practical and moral reasoning. I think these norms are legitimately&nbsp;<i>unusual</i>, in a way that justifies having a dedicated longtermist community. However, I feel as though we lack an accurate and explicit self-conception, detailing the ways in which we depart from common sense. So I\u2019ll suggest that we adopt a new self-conception \u2014 a conception partially preempted by <a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2022/11/is-the-ea-movement-dead.html\">Tyler Cowen</a>, again commenting on EA in the aftermath of FTX:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cI \u2026 anticipate a boring short-run trend, where most of the EA people scurry to signal their personal association with virtue ethics.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>And, well, there&nbsp;<i>are</i> boring ways of signaling your association with virtue ethics. So Tyler\u2019s got me in one sense, because I&nbsp;<i>do</i> want to claim that&nbsp;<strong>the longtermist community should primarily conceive of itself as a movement centered on striving towards specific&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>practical virtues</strong></i><strong>.</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7uxl4cfyv6v\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7uxl4cfyv6v\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, I don\u2019t want the longtermist movement to perfunctorily champion the importance of alternative ethical theories, while retaining an explicit conception of itself,&nbsp;<i>at the movement level</i>, in terms of a theory of the good. Instead, I want to point out the ways in which a virtue-based conception of the longtermist community \u2014 of the kind that includes both moral&nbsp;<i>and</i> epistemic virtues \u2014 provides a more faithful, and potentially less harmful conception of what the longtermist community actually stands behind.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>3.1.</p></blockquote><p>When you heard of the fraud committed by FTX, were you angry?&nbsp;</p><p>If you were, then how much of this anger occurred after you had carefully calculated the expected costs and benefits of Sam\u2019s actions, given his information at the time?&nbsp;</p><p>This isn\u2019t a cheap jab at consequentialism. Consequentialists, of course, have stories about the illegitimacy of fraud; and, in any case, I\u2019m not using the rhetorical questions above to motivate a discussion of whether,&nbsp;<i>ultimately</i>, at the level of moral theory, we want to justify our dislike of fraud on consequentialist grounds. Instead, I just want to note that, at a more proximate level, an explicit consequentialist calculation was likely not the&nbsp;<i>direct</i> cause of any outrage. Instead, we valued certain virtues, whether explicated or not, and whether ultimately grounded in consequentialism, or not.</p><p>I think many of us value virtues like integrity and honesty. And, while the appeal of those virtues are hardly unique to the longtermist community, I believe that we also see appeal in other, more unconventional virtues. One of our virtues concerns taking the potential&nbsp;<i>scale</i> of value seriously. We can call this the virtue of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/NFGEgEaLbtyrZ9dX3/scope-sensitive-ethics-capturing-the-core-intuition\"><i><u>scope-sensitivity</u></i></a>. We think that some outcomes can be&nbsp;<i>a lot</i> better than others, and strive to recognize the scale of value in our practical decisions. This virtue is one, among many, to which we aspire.&nbsp;</p><p>We also strive towards the virtue of impartiality. Or, if not complete&nbsp;<i>impartiality</i>, then we see virtue in the act of viewing oneself as a member of the&nbsp;<i>broad community of sentient beings</i>. We may still wish to be partial to our family, and loved ones, who form our closer community. But we hold in our minds a broader community still, encompassing every creature capable of having interests. We strive towards this virtue because we recognize that others \u2014 whoever, wherever, and whenever they are \u2014 have interests no less important than our own, or the interests of those more proximate.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, as Richard Ngo points out, we strive to <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bDaQsDntmSZPgiSbd/three-intuitions-about-ea-responsibility-scale-self\">take responsibility</a> for making the world better. We don't just diagnose problems, but we consider it our duty to do something about them. And, in owning up to our responsibility to tackle hard problems, we see the virtue in being modest enough to own up to the ways in which we need to <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bDaQsDntmSZPgiSbd/three-intuitions-about-ea-responsibility-scale-self#Part_3__self_improvement_and_growth_mindset\">improve, and skill up</a>, as well as the virtue in being immodest enough to believe that we actually <i>can</i> improve ourselves in relevant ways.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>3.2.</p></blockquote><p>Our sense of virtue contains epistemic components, too. We value looking at the many things we care about, and recognizing that we may face tradeoffs between our sacred values. And we strive, I hope, to face such tradeoffs not by downgrading the sacredness of our values, but by solemnly recognizing that the world constrains us in certain ways.&nbsp;</p><p>I think we aspire to the virtue of&nbsp;<i>really believing what one says</i>. We try not to treat beliefs as attire, but to recognize that our claims may&nbsp;<i>commit us</i> to other principles, or unusual courses of action, for which we were previously unaware. We take practical reasoning&nbsp;<i>seriously</i>, and consequently make use of more precise vocabulary to distinguish between our epistemic states. We talk of \u201cimmediate impressions\u201d, and \u201call-things-considered judgments\u201d, and aim to&nbsp;<i>actually treat such distinctions as relevant</i> when deciding between actions. Of course, we don\u2019t always live up to this. But I think it\u2019s fair to say that longtermists (and I think EAs generally) aspire to do this. We treat certain habits or dispositions as virtuous, and aim to move towards these ideals.&nbsp;</p><p><i>(I expect that some may read these paragraphs as objectionably self-congratulatory. But, honestly, I endorse them. EA is not the only community with notable virtues, but I think we&nbsp;<strong>do</strong> have notable virtues. Remember, none of us have to be here! We could read other stuff, get other jobs, and hang out with different people! I\u2019ve chosen to be here because, through engaging with the community, I\u2019ve felt inspired to improve along axes that I think make me a better person).&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></p><p>So, look, I don\u2019t want us to \u201cboringly signal our association with virtue ethics\u201d. Instead, I want to point out that<i> the real virtue ethics was in us all along</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>Okay, well, I don\u2019t want to say&nbsp;<i>exactly</i> that, but maybe something sort of close. I want us to recognize that, sociologically, we\u2019re united by our recognition of certain virtues \u2014 virtues that we believe to be neglected and important. And I want to claim that: insofar as longtermist EA forms a&nbsp;<i>community</i>, I think that community best viewed as one striving towards an unusual (and partially implicit) conception of moral and epistemic virtue.&nbsp;<i>That</i> feature of our community is, I believe, both unusual and worth preserving.</p><blockquote><p>3.3.</p></blockquote><p>There\u2019s a deontic norm which I think has community precedent, and ought to be part of our explicit self-conception. I\u2019ll first baptize the norm, before expanding on its content \u2014 it\u2019s the norm of&nbsp;<i>Practical Kantianism</i>; or (if you prefer)&nbsp;<i>impartially, context-specified</i>&nbsp;<i>universalizability</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>In order to clarify what I\u2019m actually suggesting, we\u2019ll refer to a comment from everyone\u2019s favorite Kantian \u2014 Rob Wiblin. And, while Rob\u2019s oeuvre contains many strident defenses of Kantianism,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflfh0939kmbg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlfh0939kmbg\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I\u2019ll limit myself to just a single quote. In <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/will-macaskill-what-we-owe-the-future/#tiny-probabilities-of-enormous-value-015340\">this</a> podcast discussion with Will, we find ourselves on the topic of how to view the expected value of contributing to some collective project (like, say, a protest), where the&nbsp;<i>whole protest</i> has positive expected value, even though it\u2019s unclear whether your&nbsp;<i>marginal contribution to the protest</i> has positive expected value.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Rob:</strong> We think it\u2019s actually worth thinking at a more group level, where you think: given the full cost of a project, given all of the people who might have to participate in it for it to reach a reasonable scale, and given the probability of that project as a whole, with all of those inputs succeeding, is it worth it in aggregate? And then if it is, then it\u2019s probably worth it for each of the individual contributors to participate in it.</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Rob:</strong> And that\u2019s a much more natural way of evaluating whether something is worthwhile than thinking about whether it\u2019s worth you going in for one individual day more to work on the project. It\u2019s too granular.</p></blockquote><p>(Earlier in the podcast, Will echoes a similar thought, noting that \u201coften the right way to think [about collective action] is through viewing yourself primarily as a \u201cmember of the community that you\u2019re a part of that is taking action\u201d).</p><p>In practice, I believe that many in the longtermist community would&nbsp;<i>actually endorse</i> something like Practical Kantianism. Instead of considering what the marginal contribution&nbsp;<i>I, as an individual</i> can make on the margin, longtermists are more likely to make a Kantian move \u2014 they\u2019re more likely to treat&nbsp;<i>maxims</i>&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzl3xy4qy8mr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzl3xy4qy8mr\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;as the proper object of normative evaluation, rather than the action of a single, lone individual.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnaso7t8uh1\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnaso7t8uh1\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;That is, longtermists are more likely, I think, to treat the action of some larger&nbsp;<i>community</i> as foundational, and then assess the value of individual actions in virtue of their contribution to the net-effect of that community\u2019s actions.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, if you\u2019re doing Practical Kantianism, you have to carefully specify the context, and relevant community. No one endorses claims like: \u201cI can\u2019t go to the shops right now, because&nbsp;<i>if everyone</i> did that, all the surgeons would be off-duty, and people would die!\u201d. You specify the context (including relevant contextual facts about your antecedent responsibilities and commitments), and then treat the <i>maxim</i> as your object of evaluation, rather than the lone <i>act</i> of an individual agent. It\u2019s important to specify the context&nbsp;<i>impartially</i>, too. We don\u2019t want to allow claims like \u201c<i>Violet Hour</i> can lie for the greater good, because lying, from my perspective, has better expected consequences!\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, admittedly, I\u2019ve cited just a single example, in one off-the-cuff podcast comment. But Rob here is espousing a general principle, rather than an isolated reaction to a particular problem case. Also, Rob is the&nbsp;<i>Research Director</i> at 80,000 Hours, opining on questions of how to view the rationality of aggregate, community-level decisions. So, if Will is championing the wrongness of rights violations, Eliezer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1296560652358582273\"><u>consistently</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/819734004098158592\"><u>endorses</u></a> the virtues of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1593386082493530112\"><u>practical</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1497157447219232768\"><u>deontology</u></a>, and Rob is a well-known Kantian, then I think it\u2019s fair to say that my norm has precedent, and could be worth centering more explicitly in our self-conception.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>3.4.</p></blockquote><p>I recognize that my suggestion of an alternative community self-conception is somewhat vague, and raises various questions. Questions like:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWhich virtues ought we to adopt? How do we just decide upon a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/sparkles/\">\u2728</a>~community self-conception~&nbsp;<a href=\"https://emojipedia.org/sparkles/\">\u2728</a>, and who could actually implement what you say? Also,&nbsp;<i>what the hell is Practical Kantianism anyway?</i> &nbsp;Oh, and can\u2019t we just frame the Kantian stuff in terms of updateless decision theory?\u201d</p></blockquote><p>All good questions, all good questions, and I\u2019m not sure my answers will be all that satisfying. To answer briefly: I don\u2019t have a precise sense of our implicit virtues, though I\u2019m thinking more about it. Secondly, implementation is hard, and would probably have to arise from highly visible EA organizations \u2014 like CEA, or 80,000 Hours, and others I\u2019m probably unfairly leaving out \u2014 putting out public statements, and emphasizing such features in community building. (I\u2019ll save the final two questions for another time).&nbsp;</p><h1>4. Fin</h1><p><strong>I am suggesting a change in the longtermist community\u2019s self-conception, but I do not think that we need to do a PR-focused \u2018rebrand\u2019</strong>. Instead, I am suggesting this alternative self-conception for the following reasons:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>(1) I have an <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/829tAQAYAntkRxCy2/effective-altruism-s-implicit-epistemology\">antecedent belief</a> that the longtermist community lacks an accurate and explicit self-conception.&nbsp;</p><p>(2) I believe that the aftermath of FTX presents an opportunity for us to collectively explicate and reevaluate some of our core commitments.</p><p>(3) I hold hope that an alternative community self-conception more explicitly focused on practical, on-the-ground norms we wish to encourage would help mitigate the chance of&nbsp;<i>something like</i> the FTX situation happening in the future.</p></blockquote><p>So, to conclude, maybe longtermism is not centrally about maximization, or at least shouldn\u2019t be. Instead, the longtermist community should aim to be a community of time-impartial Kantians, striving to embody a series of neglected virtues.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn6xvpx1sblo7\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref6xvpx1sblo7\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>That is, our norms about what constitutes right action.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn7uxl4cfyv6v\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref7uxl4cfyv6v\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>This is irrespective of the ultimate moral theory in which you may, ultimately, wish to ground such virtue talk \u2014 or, indeed, if you&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-theory/#ContBetwMoraOtheNormDoma\"><u>object</u></a> to having a \u2018theory\u2019 of the good at all.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnlfh0939kmbg\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreflfh0939kmbg\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>This is a joke.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnzl3xy4qy8mr\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefzl3xy4qy8mr\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;A maxim is a claim, broadly speaking, of the form: \u2018do action A in context C in order to achieve ends E\u2019.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnnaso7t8uh1\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefnaso7t8uh1\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;I\u2019m already going&nbsp;<i>a bit</i> rogue here, so I might as well speculate that endorsement of the Kantian may reflect one (among many) deeper differences between longtermist and neartermist EAs.
