E.g. the 30m bus ride between the office and the hotel; late night after a kickback is officially over.</li><li>Casual repeated interactions lead to friendships; plan your events and spaces so that people run into people again and again.</li><li>Start off as a dictator when eg picking places to get dinner, rather than polling everyone and trying to get consensus. In the beginning, people just need a single Schelling point; as they get to know each other better they'll naturally start forming their own plans.</li><li>Perhaps obvious, but maintain a shared group chat; have at least one for official announcements, and a lounge for more casual chatting. Slack or Discord are good for this.</li></ul>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "akrolsmir"}}, {"_id": "AqYe6GKSviws9igop", "postedAt": "2023-01-17T03:57:00.796Z", "postId": "AoqwhAY5faTHfYu4Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you for such kindness Austin -- I'm glad it was helpful! :)</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "FyAfm5ra9JsfadGpp", "user": {"username": "joel_bkr"}}, {"_id": "6dndamnz4zuH3Xtyq", "postedAt": "2023-01-17T08:54:21.741Z", "postId": "AoqwhAY5faTHfYu4Z", "htmlBody": "<p>As someone who's run dozens of EA events and several retreats (though not fellowships) just noting that this all strikes me as good advice.</p><p>I particularly want to highlight paying attention to getting enough people to achieve the vibe you want (which may well be &gt;30 for fellowships) and sharing visit dates (huge deal but often overlooked).</p><p>I also really like the tone and structure of the post.</p><p>Thanks for sharing :-)</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Holly"}}, {"_id": "uusQgPTELhwLs7yhi", "postedAt": "2023-01-17T10:53:43.379Z", "postId": "AoqwhAY5faTHfYu4Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for sharing Joel, those points all seem very sensible to me, and as a visitor in your program I also want to attest to how much I enjoyed the program you ran!&nbsp;</p><p>I want to +1 the part about basic amenities, especially part (2.).

You can imagine a 10 year-long program where people only stay for 4 months max at a time.

If n=1, there's only one person and they can't shake anyone else's hand, so 0 handshakes take place. If n=2, the second person can shake the first person's hand, so there's 1 handshake. If n=3, the third person shakes hands with each of the first two people, who also shake hands with each other. In general, the solution for n people is (n-1) + (n-2) + ... + 2 + 1 + 0 = n*(n-1)/2. The most important insight or takeaway is that this expression is proportional to the square of the number of people, so the number of handshakes grows quadratically as more people are added.</p><p>I think fellowships strongly experience this effect, where adding one more participant to a small group will let that person meet the others in the group and provide a valuable connection to those few people, but adding one more participant to a large group provides a potential valuable connection to a lot more people. Going from 30 participants to 31 has a lot more potential upside than going from 20 participants to 21.</p><p>(These effects don't continue forever, because there are different limiting factors that become relevant. Adding one attendee to a 1500-person conference doesn't quadratically increase the value of the conference because the first 1500 people are already limited by the number of 1-on-1s they have time for during the event. And you can't just change the fellowship from 30 people to 60 and expect it to be 4x as good; at that point, you're going to start needing more space and everyone is going to be far from some of the other people, so there's an asymptotic bound to the value that is less than quadratic.)</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "robirahman"}}, {"_id": "eE5T6H2tMFNvLFozs", "postedAt": "2023-01-18T13:29:44.730Z", "postId": "AoqwhAY5faTHfYu4Z", "htmlBody": "<p>(Robi mentioned this to me in person; I thought it was insightful/asked him to comment.)

As Rob notes, coordination is difficult.</p>\n<p>I think for EA Mexico the social opportunities and activities have been good (at least for the time I've been here). And there's been pretty good opportunities to informally chat and 1-on-1.  That's all you really might want for a short program of a day or so. But if we're going to be doing long (multi-week+) fellowships, I think we can try to do better.</p>\n<p>I think that what is lacking a bit is the opportunity to organize actual work discussions/working together. I think this merits coordination in a few ways. We need to know who is here, what they are doing, but they are interested in, what their skills are, and whether and when they were interested in working together. We also need to coordinate the social expectations of when it's OK to 'talk work' with someone or ask them for help and  feedback on work.</p>\n<p>I tried to start something in <a href=\"https://airtable.com/invite/l?inviteId=invdLjFIc0t9RKRLk&amp;inviteToken=6358fb8ef1aea1cfe7ab7981ed1ac5a967a0995cfcf9de223c82ea14a057cc98&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=product_team&amp;utm_content=transactional-alerts\">this Airtable</a> as you know, but I shared it a bit late in the game.

If you go to that space at that time, you partner up, chat, help each other, and get solutions to your problems.
