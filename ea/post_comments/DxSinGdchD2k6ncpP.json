The CO2e/kg estimates are 10-100x higher than previous studies. And while the author doesn't claim a conflict of interest, all the authors are at UC Davis in the same college as the <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/31/climate/frank-mitloehner-uc-davis.html\">Clear Center, a beef-industry funded advocacy organization</a>. I don't think academic work should be dismissed outright for an apparent unstated conflict of interest, but it does warrant extra scrutiny.
