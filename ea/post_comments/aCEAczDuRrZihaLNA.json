&nbsp;Not just for the added strength; why make the organism look for calcium and phosphorus instead of just carbon?</p><p>The search process of evolutionary biology is not the search of engineering; natural selection can only access designs via pathways of incremental mutations that are locally advantageous, not intelligently designed simultaneous changes that compensate for each other. &nbsp;There were, last time I checked, only three known cases where evolutionary biology invented the freely rotating wheel. &nbsp;Two of those known cases are ATP synthase and the bacterial flagellum, which demonstrates that freely rotating wheels are in fact incredibly useful in biology, and are conserved when biology stumbles across them after a few hundred million years of search. &nbsp;But there's no use for a freely rotating wheel without a bearing and there's no use for a bearing without a freely rotating wheel, and a simultaneous dependency like that is a huge obstacle to biology, even though it's a hardly noticeable obstacle to intelligent engineering.</p><p>The entire human body, faced with a strong impact like being gored by a rhinocerous horn, will fail at its weakest point, not its strongest point. &nbsp;How much evolutionary advantage is there to stronger bone, if what fails first is torn muscle? &nbsp;How much advantage is there to an impact-resistant kidney, if most fights that destroy a kidney will kill you anyways? &nbsp;Evolution is not the sort of optimizer that says, \"Okay, let's design an <i>entire</i> stronger body.\" &nbsp;(Analogously, the collection of faults that add up to \"old age\" is large enough that a little more age resistance in one place is not much of an advantage if other aging systems or outward accidents will soon kill you anyways.)</p><p>I don't even think we have much of a reason to believe that it'd be physically (rather than informationally) difficult to have a set of enzymes that synthesize diamond. &nbsp;It could just require 3 things to go right simultaneously, and so be much much harder to stumble across than tossing more hydroxyapatite to lock into place in a bone crystal. &nbsp;And then even if somehow evolution hit on the right set of 3 simultaneous mutations, sometime over the history of Earth, the resulting little isolated chunk of diamond probably would not be somewhere in the phenotype that had previously constituted the weakest point in a mechanical system that frequently failed. &nbsp;If evolution has huge difficulty inventing wheels, why expect that it could build diamond chainmail, even assuming that diamond chainmail is physically possible and could be useful to an organism that had it?</p><p>Talking to the general public is hard. &nbsp;The first concept I'm trying to convey to them is that there's an underlying physical, mechanical reason that flesh is weaker than diamond; and that this reason <i>isn't </i>that things animated by vitalic spirit, elan vital, can self-heal and self-reproduce at the cost of being weaker than the cold steel making up lifeless machines, as is the price of magic imposed by the universe to maintain game balance. &nbsp;This is a very natural way for humans to think; and the thing I am trying to come in and do is say, \"Actually, no, it's not a mystical balance, it's that diamond is held together by bonds that are hundreds of kJ/mol; and the mechanical strength of proteins is determined by forces a hundred times as weak as that, the part where proteins fold up like spaghetti held together by static cling.\"</p><p>There is then a deeper story that's even harder to explain, about <i>why </i>evolution doesn't build freely rotating wheels or diamond chainmail; why evolutionary design doesn't find the physically possible stronger systems. &nbsp;But first you need to give people a mechanical intuition for why, in a very rough intuitive sense, it <i>is </i>physically possible to have stuff that moves and lives and self-repairs but is strong like diamond instead of flesh, without this violating a mystical balance where the price of vitalic animation is lower material strength.</p><p>And that mechanical intuition is: &nbsp;Deep down is a bunch of stuff that, if you could see videos of it, would look more like tiny machines than like magic, though they would not look like familiar machines (very few freely rotating wheels). &nbsp;Then why aren't these machines strong like human machines of steel are strong? &nbsp;Because iron atoms are stronger than carbon atoms? &nbsp;Actually no, diamond is made of carbon and that's still quite strong. &nbsp;The reason is that these tiny systems of machinery are held together <i>(at the weakest joints, not the strongest joints!)</i> by static cling.</p><p>And then the deeper question: &nbsp;<i>Why</i> does evolution build that way? &nbsp;And the deeper answer: &nbsp;Because everything evolution builds is arrived at as an error, a mutation, from something else that it builds. &nbsp;Very tight bonds fold up along very deterministic pathways. &nbsp;So (in the average case, not every case) the neighborhood of functionally similar designs is densely connected along shallow energy gradients and sparsely connected along deep energy gradients. &nbsp;Intelligence can leap long distances through that design space using coordinated changes, but evolutionary exploration usually cannot.</p><p>And I <i>do</i> try to explain that too. &nbsp;But it is legitimately more abstract and harder to understand. &nbsp;So I lead with the idea that proteins are held together by static cling. &nbsp;This is, I think, validly the first fact you lead with if the audience does not already know it, and just has no clue why anyone could possibly possibly think that there <i>might even be</i> machinery that does what bacterial machinery does but better. &nbsp;The typical audience is not starting out with the intuition that one would <i>naively</i> think that of course you could put together stronger molecular machinery, given the physics of stronger bonds, and then we debate whether (as I believe) the naive intuition is actually just valid and correct; they don't understand what the naive intuition is about, and that's the first thing to convey.</p><p>If somebody then says, \"How can you be so ignorant of chemistry? &nbsp;<i>Some</i> atoms in protein are held together by covalent bonds, not by static cling! &nbsp;There's even eg sulfur bonds whereby some parts of the folded-spaghetti systems end up glued together with real glue!\" then this does not <i>validly </i>address the original point because: the underlying point about why flesh is more easily cleaved than diamond, is about <i>the weakest points of flesh</i> rather than <i>the strongest points in flesh,</i> because that's what determines the mechanical strength of the larger system.</p><p>I think there is an important way of looking at questions like these where, at the final end, you ask yourself, \"Okay, but does my argument prove that flesh is in fact as strong as diamond? &nbsp;Why isn't flesh as strong as diamond, then, if I've refuted the original argument for why it isn't?\" and this is the question that leads you to realize that some local strong covalent bonds don't matter to the argument if those bonds aren't the parts that break under load.</p><p>My main moral qualm about using the Argument From Folded Spaghetti Held Together By Static Cling as an intuition pump is that the local ionic bonds in bone are legitimately as strong per-bond as the C-C bonds in diamond, and the reason that bone is weaker than diamond is (iiuc) actually more about irregularity, fault lines, and resistance to local deformation than about kJ/mol of the underlying bonds. &nbsp;If somebody says \"Okay, fine, you've validly explained why flesh is weaker than diamond, but why is <i>bone</i> weaker than diamond?\" I have to reply \"Valid, iiuc that's legit more about irregularity and fault lines and interlaced weaker superstructure and local deformation resistance of the bonds, rather than the raw potential energy deltas of the load-bearing welds.\"</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "EliezerYudkowsky"}}, {"_id": "zbYxAAQoHHyq3wraB", "postedAt": "2023-12-06T20:48:22.864Z", "postId": "aCEAczDuRrZihaLNA", "htmlBody": "<p>Okay. I'm going to take you at your word that you understand that biology is, at it's core, almost entirely built out of covalent bonds.

Let's instead talk about a structure which has at it's core a large steel wire (representing covalent bonds), where parallel sections are glued to each with extremely strong glue(that is obviously weaker than steel bonds) to build a backbone, and then finally those backbones are folded into a weird shape, and joined together at various points with a combination of steel welds, superglue, and sometimes bits of string (representing Van der waals forces). &nbsp;We can call this chunk a \"glorpein\".&nbsp;</p><p>Now I come around, and I want to point out the problems with glorpein.

As just one example, you can give a protein a blast of heat that breaks all the non covalent bonds... and then often once the heat leaves, it will reform itself right back to what it was before, because it's still <i>held together by covalent bonds</i>. This is one reason why you can't just reduce things to their weakest links, and forget about the other <i>99%</i> of what holds it together.&nbsp;</p><p>And again, while diamond is stronger than proteins, it's also a lot stiffer, less flexible, and less versatile, which is why attempts to build diamond based nanomachines have so far failed.

Check out <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XBjiEsAyNQs\">this video</a> of a diamond being shattered with a regular hammer! Being able to deform and then rebound back into place offers advantages in many situations, and it's why wood and metal doesn't similarly shatter.</p><p>To be clear, I obviously still think diamond is stronger than wood along most other measures, such as melting temp, hardness, etc. But there is not zero cost to the rigidity and stiffness of diamond.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a relatively minor (but interesting!) point though, please do not only respond to the last two paragraphs.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "iAzTK3Dn4fBeazNJS", "user": {"username": "titotal"}}, {"_id": "YKAxC8WNaaJLXMCvC", "postedAt": "2023-12-09T01:57:38.856Z", "postId": "aCEAczDuRrZihaLNA", "htmlBody": "<p>A short and oversimplified answer is that the keratin in horn is not as densely linked with bonds as diamond is, and consequently the atoms are less confined (in a way diamond is sort of like a maximally crosslinked material, though it's not usually described that way).&nbsp;</p><p>Generally speaking, crosslinking polymers (including proteins) tends to increase their rigidity. To use a non-living example, when latex is treated with sulfur, the polymer chains also get crosslinked with those same disulfide bonds, producing \"vulcanized\" rubber which is harder and tougher.&nbsp;</p><p>The crosslinks are why you'll sometimes see people say that vulcanized rubber is \"one big molecule\" (though in practice it's hard to tell if the crosslinking was actually so complete and to link every polymer chain). This is also why vulcanized rubber doesn't really melt, increasing the temperature will cause chemical changes instead (and while I'm not sure, my educated guess it that something similar would happen if you try to melt animal horns).</p><p><br>P.S. I didn't bring it up earlier, but I don't think your earlier statement about the way the masses of the atoms affect the bond strength is accurate. As a counterexample I'd point out that the deuterium-oxygen bond in heavy water is actually a little stronger than that of the protium-oxygen bond in regular water, and in that case the only change is using a more massive form of hydrogen.</p>", "parentCommentId": "iAzTK3Dn4fBeazNJS", "user": {"username": "Thomas Pilgrim"}}, {"_id": "HShywBsok8mf7ME2c", "postedAt": "2023-12-11T06:54:23.278Z", "postId": "aCEAczDuRrZihaLNA", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>Why is flesh weaker than diamond?</p></blockquote><p>I don't think this is a fair comparison. If nature wanted skin to be harder, it can do that, for instance with scales (particularly hard in the case of turtle shells). Of course your logic explains why diamond is harder than bone.
