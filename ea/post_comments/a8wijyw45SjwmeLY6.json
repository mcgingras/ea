Optionally, each year it could announce the algorithm for the fiscal year that began three years from the current year so that there was always a three-year funding algorithm in place.</p><p>This would be vaguely similar to what it is doing for some of the EA Funds (although given GWWC's more democratic spirit the formula should factor in number of donors rather than being so heavily based on volume raised). In essence, OP would be deferring to the community's pocketbook vote as to renewal of GWWC's grant and (within bounds) adjustments to the amounts granted. There's a cost for OP there -- the algorithm might lead to a somewhat different grant amount than OP would have chosen under the traditional system, but proper construction of the algorithm should keep the amount \"on rails.\" And GWWC's budget is on the smaller side, so the possible variance should be possible despite the risks of endowment changes and similar events. (Or they could be written into the algorithm.)</p><p>This is also a more general idea for other components of what we might term \"EA Core Democratic-Leaning Infrastructure,\" which would also encompass the basic expenses of running the Forum (not the entire CEA Online Team budget request), most of CEA Community Health / Special Projects, and probably a few other things as well. These are all functions for which it would be good for the work to be funded more by a broad base of donors and less by Open Phil.</p>", "parentCommentId": "ejiECikknn3dxWDXo", "user": {"username": "Jason"}}]
