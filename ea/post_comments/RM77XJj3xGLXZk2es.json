Are you getting lots of people coming to your meetups and then not coming back or is it mostly just the regular with very few new members? Importantly, if a group has a low retention rate, they probably don't want to scale reach as they'd just burning through people who might have become members if they'd been better placed to capture them. Anyway, from what I've heard mass media outreach doesn't really seem to have been effective for EA groups and that matches what I've seen in Australia too where I haven't heard of a single person who first heard of Effective Altruism through mass media, while in contrast, I've met several who heard of us through more niche channels like podcasts.</p>\n<p>Anyway, I'm hugely in favour of EA Sweden exploring politics as it really does seem to be a comparative advantage for the reasons given. EA is much more likely to be able to influence politics in smaller countries where you have more chance of getting a meeting with important people and there are a lot of advantages of exploring working in politics when any fallout might be contained.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "casebash"}}, {"_id": "uJADKtj3BobfmQshd", "postedAt": "2018-02-05T13:35:37.250Z", "postId": "RM77XJj3xGLXZk2es", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for the input!</p>\n<p>Yeah, looking at where the drop-off is seems like a very good idea.

E.g. by \u201cthe funnel of 80k\u201d do you then mean their significant plan changes or how many of your members receive personal coaching from them?

Especially in a Scandinavian context where consensus decisions are really important. It also seems really important to me to avoid risks of feelings of resentment. My hunch is that this is mainly avoided by transparency and honesty, regarding e.g. where the money is coming from and what it's for. However, I think that effect is outweighed by other effects. I\u2019ve seen people\u2019s engagement in doing stuff for EAS go up since I started working full-time, partly since that means I can spend more time and energy into being a leader,  encouraging and helping people to become usefully involved. However, with all of these things, people who have done this sort of thing for longer will likely know better. </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>We intend to use IASPC, but also figures regarding number of coachings, referrals etc. Regarding donations, the idea is to get data on how many swedish donations go through EA Funds. In addition to this, we will likely collect our own data on impact as well through a survey. </p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n", "parentCommentId": "dMkRRomH78pAwSbqq", "user": {"username": "MarkusAnderljung"}}, {"_id": "CA8suiNo55oAYRimP", "postedAt": "2019-12-13T09:54:52.845Z", "postId": "RM77XJj3xGLXZk2es", "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>Hey!
