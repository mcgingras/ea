Now, let's say researchers find the sequence of a novel pathogen that would likely spark a pandemic if released. Most would want this sequence to be added to synthesis screening databases. But <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbioe.2019.00086/full\">some</a> also want this database to be <i>public. </i>The information hazards involved in making such information publicly available could be large, especially if there is attached discussion of how <i>exactly</i> these sequences are dangerous.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Simon_Grimm"}}, {"_id": "LpEkfrHgmw6GZXMNJ", "postedAt": "2023-08-31T11:00:36.378Z", "postId": "PTtZWBAKgrrnZj73n", "htmlBody": "<p>Yup!</p>\n<p>(I expected to see your comment link to <a href=\"https://securedna.org/\">SecureDNA</a>, which has a cryptographic solution to screening synthesis without either (a) sending hazards to synthesizers or (b) sending reconstructible synthesis orders to others.)</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "FGqPToDQL97LHEA3G", "user": {"username": "Jeff_Kaufman"}}, {"_id": "iZei2adtdtnawBpya", "postedAt": "2023-08-31T19:48:37.445Z", "postId": "PTtZWBAKgrrnZj73n", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>Executive summary</strong>: The cultures of biosecurity and computer security differ in important ways due to the differences in constraints and capabilities surrounding biological vs. computer vulnerabilities.<br><br><strong>Key points</strong>:</p><ol><li>Computer security culture values openness, breaking things to understand them, and satisfying curiosity. This culture developed in a context where vulnerabilities could be fixed by vendors, avoided in future software, and mitigated by users.</li><li>Biosecurity culture is much more cautious about disclosing and exploring vulnerabilities. This is because biology lacks easy fixes, mitigations are expensive, and a vulnerability could enable serious harm if exploited by malicious actors.</li><li>The norms of computer security culture would be risky and irresponsible if applied directly to biosecurity. The constraints are different enough that different norms have developed.</li><li>There are good reasons for biosecurity culture being more closed and cautious than typical computer security culture given the lack of mechanisms for mitigating biological risks.</li><li>Understanding these different constraints helps explain the different norms despite both fields dealing with vulnerabilities and risks.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>This comment was auto-generated by the EA Forum Team.

But I think it\u2019s worth noting that although they do use the phrase \u201cpublicly available\u201d a couple of times, they also pretty explicitly discuss the idea of having such a database be accessible to synthesis providers only, which is a much smaller set and seems to carry significantly lower risks for misuse than truly public access. Relevant quote:</p>\n<p>\u201cSustained funding and commitment will be required to build and maintain a database of risk-associated sequences, their known mechanisms of pathogenicity and the biological contexts in which these mechanisms can cause harm. This database (or at a minimum a screening capability making use of this database), to have maximum impact on global DNA synthesis screening, must be available to both domestic and international providers.\u201d</p>\n<p>Also worth noting the parenthetical about having providers use a screening mechanism with access to the database without having such direct access themselves, which seems like a nod to some of the features in, eg, SecureDNA\u2019s approach.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "FGqPToDQL97LHEA3G", "user": {"username": "jtm"}}, {"_id": "dvydiMvjqrtHGspA9", "postedAt": "2023-09-01T02:45:52.071Z", "postId": "PTtZWBAKgrrnZj73n", "htmlBody": "<p>I think benchtop synthesizers would change this quite a bit?
