We'll do this alongside maintaining our more established programmes e.g., our <a href=\"https://effectiefaltruisme.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0d235948217a55858a0e810c4&amp;id=fa4ebc6612&amp;e=207a255e38\"><strong>national EA crash course</strong></a>, our support for <a href=\"https://effectiefaltruisme.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0d235948217a55858a0e810c4&amp;id=bef768e895&amp;e=207a255e38\"><strong>organisers around the country</strong></a>, and our <a href=\"https://effectiefaltruisme.us14.list-manage.com/track/click?u=0d235948217a55858a0e810c4&amp;id=1b6a56af6b&amp;e=207a255e38\"><strong>co-working office</strong></a>.<br><br>In terms of measuring success, we still need to develop the strategy, so it is not currently possible to say in detail how we will evaluate it. Broadly speaking, we want to increase awareness of, and inclination towards, effective altruism amongst proto-EAs in the Netherlands. We also want to ensure inclination remains high amongst the general public once they become aware of us. Therefore, to evaluate the impact of this work, we will probably conduct surveys to measure awareness and inclination amongst proto-EAs and the general public before and after the interventions outlined in the strategy, whatever they may be, are implemented.&nbsp;<br><br>Of course we'll also keep an eye on basic comms metrics like newsletter subscribers, LinkedIn followers, etc. And downstream metrics like intro programme completions, etc.&nbsp;<br><br>For Q1 our comms OKR is as follows:<br><br>Objective: Comms - develop our strategy (ready to be handed to volunteer team)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Key Results &nbsp;</p><ol><li>Get 100 survey responses for our Dutch proto-EA marketing survey by March 8th (this asks about media consumption habits, barriers faced, recommendations for media platforms/influencers, etc).</li><li>Internal publication of an analysis of the survey's results by March 15th (we're probably going to miss this deadline, in the end, we decided to rely on a volunteer for the analysis)</li><li>Internal publication of a communications strategy (in the style of Rumelt) consisting of a diagnosis, guiding policy, and a set of coherent actions by March 22nd (again, we're probably going to miss this target)</li><li>Recruit a team of 3+ volunteers by March 31st to help us implement the strategy (supplementing the marketing strategist and the google ads marketeer we've already got on the team)</li></ol>", "parentCommentId": "2Fmfu6yPuy9jnGRD2", "user": {"username": "James Herbert"}}]
