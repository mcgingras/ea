Sam had by many been seen as a trusted EA leader, and had previously been on the board of CEA US. It seemed it wouldn't be unreasonable if people in EA (or even within EV) started worrying that leadership were covering things up. Having an external investigation was, although not a cheap signal to send, much cheaper in worlds where there was nothing to hide compared to worlds where we wanted to hide something; and internal trust is extremely important. Between that and wanting to be able to credibly signal to external stakeholders like the Charity Commission, I think general PR was a long way down the list of considerations.</p>", "parentCommentId": "ZMchmaKwEbPRhnkQY", "user": {"username": "Owen_Cotton-Barratt"}}]
