I understood what you were trying to say  but I had to read it a few times. By my understanding: that you are not convinced that just 5 strong votes should not be worth the same as 11 votes which include some strong votes, or fifteen regular votes.</p>\n<p>To make things perhaps more confusing I'm not sure everyone has the same multiplier between regular and strong votes. Initially a regular vote is worth 1 and a strong vote 2, now my regular votes are worth 1 and strong votes are worth 3. So at the very least the 3x multiplier is not the same for newer users.</p>\n<p>I can also see the potential of people trying to balance out the fact that their votes are worth less by doing strong votes, or generally people not being completely consistent between what they count as a strong vote and what they just count as a regular vote (e.g. between days or depending on the mood, or on the type of post) . I expect between people there is also likely variation of how strongly they need to agree to something before they strong vote it.</p>\n<p>Adding a cost to the strong votes would certainly make people less likely to strong vote, but having it as a 'fixed fine' of 1 will make no real difference if you have a lot of karma, but if you have less karma it will make more of one (e.g. I believe you need a certain amount of karma to add coauthors to posts). So for newer users this would be both having their votes be worth less in comparison and higher costs for them using the strong votes, which I do not think is a good idea.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "qXd3Pc3tGjn8KbMWM", "user": {"username": "LinBowkerLonnecker"}}, {"_id": "ouyB4vfkRtbYN92Jm", "postedAt": "2023-01-02T18:32:29.298Z", "postId": "YmPnzpzo5dxPozinc", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks -- edited to try to clarify that the +2/+6 were example values.
