You see it all the time - in political slogans and everyday speech - with more connection with modern medicine than the Nazis. You\u2018ll see crudely scribbled messages using eugenic language all over the countryside (the most common, until recently, being \u5c11\u751f\u4f18\u751f\uff0c\u5e78\u798f\u4e00\u751f <i>shaosheng yousheng, xingfu yisheng; </i>translated as \"Have few(er) and high(er)-quality (eugenic) children, and be happy your whole life!). You'll also hear TV hosts and politicians discussing <i>youshengxue</i> as if it were as anodyne a concept as entomology. This forum post would read as nonsense to many Chinese people (the title would read as something like: \"Most people endorse having healthy children\"). You do get some exceptions, especially among foreign-educated people (see this <a href=\"https://www.zhihu.com/question/22208730/answer/753573920\">Zhihu response</a> (Chinese)), and I'm also unsure what (more western-influenced) HK/ Taiwanese people think about it.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://baike.baidu.com/item/%E4%BC%98%E7%94%9F%E5%AD%A6/1172980\">Baidu Baike</a> (Chinese Wikipedia) first line is: \"\u4f18\u751f/Eugenics is the most important issue concerning marriages and families, it is a science that uses the principles of genetics to guarantee the normal survival ability of the next generation.\" The 'dark history' of eugenics, particularly in Nazi Germany is mentioned briefly in one paragraph.

You could say that in China it's good that you're actually allowed to talk about this sensitive topic openly and rationally, without having a ridiculous and illogical cached concept where 'wanting to have healthier children = nazi race science'. This is generally my experience and makes way more sense to me personally. If someone has distinctly dodgy views (spoiler alert: they do), you can argue with them without anyone using 'but that's eugenics' to end the argument without actually addressing the issues.&nbsp;</p><p>But, from a consequentialist perspective, you could also say: \"China doesn't have a \"eugenics taboo\" and look at the consequences\" (horrible one-child policy + forced sterilisations/ abortions + non-Han ethnic cleansing are seen as okay).

Rather, Deng Xiaoping's advisors in the 1970s over-reacted to Western antinatalist, degrowth, eco-alarmist propaganda as promoted by Paul Ehrlich, the Club of Rome, and others. Then in the late 1970s they hired physicists untrained in demography to do simplistic models of China's expected population growth, based on outdated, unreliable census data from the early 1960s. They panicked about Chinese 'over-population' because the West was panicking about 'over-population', and the one-child policy was the result.

There is no dating app that matches you with your exactly optimal genetic partner (don't get any ideas if you live in silicon valley), people don't want that and it speaks to our innate desire to select a variety of genes rather than the \"best\" genes. Even though genes that happen to be good in the current environment tend to be more selected for, this happens naturally and unconsciously which is what separates it from eugenics.
