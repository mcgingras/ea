(A major restriction was that people didn't generally think inventing things was a worthwhile pursuit; the governments of the time thought that building huge monuments was a better use of resources.

It seems reasonable for rerunning history. However, for something like fossil fuels and mineral resources being more expensive, it might not just be a delay in getting industry, but instead not having rapid enough economic growth to exceed population growth and therefore escape the Malthusian trap. Even worse would be potential permanent changes in humanity, such as a change in genetics due to radioactive damage (I don't think we have enough nuclear weapons to do that now, but in some future scenario, we might). Similarly, perhaps the massive mortality of the catastrophe could select for people with less desirable characteristics, such as lower trust. If the catastrophe involved the loss of the grass family, that would have excluded all agricultural civilizations except for the Andean one. There could also be an endemic disease that prevents high population density, which is basically required for civilization. You mentioned long-lasting anthropogenic climate change as being a significant risk, but naturally we could go back into an Ice Age or just have a generally less stable climate than the last 10,000 years.</p><p>I think the bigger picture is how much a catastrophe reduces our long-term potential of humanity.

I will go ahead and say that might be a bad definition to use. If anyone who had any knowledge about the nuclear protocol of any country with an arsenal survived, then plausibly we could launch dozens + nukes once we got a few basic functionalities up and running. Similar things could be said about AGI, if we imagine it has been invented before the collapse. I guess this does start to get really in the weeds of each countries nuclear protocall and how easy it would be to access them just based on the systematic defenses in place. I am completely out of my depth here. It's possible that without a bunch of passcodes or people who remember certain things and have access to certain doors it's all impossible. But on the other hand if most people are dead you can just start dynamiting parts of the pentagon until you find the right room...</p><p>( I think it's an open question if nukes actually pose an existential risk until you start launching absurd amounts of them, something Luisa herself has done research on IIRC. Still, i'm mainly going off of getting to the level of destruction we could have created in 1945)</p><p>It seems like it is the creation of new objects and technology that will take a lot of time.

There will be this sense in the air of what things can become/return to, and it won't be some vague notion of progress, it will be a very specific notion of planes, capitalism, computers, etc. It will be massively important that people understand that they can get to these things. I'd even go farther than you and say it's not inventing the technologies that takes so much time, but the combination of having to invent them and not knowing which technologies to invent in the first place. If we told the romans that they should invent electricity I feel like it's not that crazy to think they would have figured it out (depending on how much we specify what electricity is).</p><p>That's why I said in my other comment that it might make sense to look at developing countries that leveraged catchup growth rather then rerunning history as a baseline. These countries had a similar Zeitgeist (i'm sort of just using this as a placeholder word until I can specify what I mean more) in this dimension. (some) People in these countries went to developed nations and saw what things could become. Of course it is also important they have some idea how to get there, but I don't see that as much of a crux, since there should be books lying around everywhere.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "m9xtvcNGZnduEcRvf", "user": {"username": "Charles_Guthmann"}}, {"_id": "iX5XuaCd4SsJSReGy", "postedAt": "2022-10-28T09:41:12.382Z", "postId": "Nc9fCzjBKYDaDJGiX", "htmlBody": "<p>Also I don't see why it would take even close to 100 years to get to ancient Athens.

Then we are still producing 4-8x the food as them per person. And this seems like an incredibly conservative assumption. Because if civilization collapsed, we wouldn't be farming oranges and bananas and spinach and berries, etc. We'd be farming corn and potatoes, which are both more calorie dense and extremely automated/optimized and thus trending way above the general efficiency ratios noted above.</p><p>With this abundance of food we could immediately spend the majority of our time studying modern civilization and rebuilding.
