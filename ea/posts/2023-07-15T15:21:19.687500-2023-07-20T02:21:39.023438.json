Additionally we now have the rules on a landing page that new members need to agree to in order to join other channels. In addition to rules of conduct, we are for the time being limiting membership to people who are, have been, or suspect they may be addicts or have a related condition of some kind. We manually grandfathered in anyone who joined the server before the landing pad was created, even if they do not meet these criteria, but still ask that they like everyone follow the other rules, or risk being banned.</p>\n<p>Since <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/F2MfbmRAiMx2PDhaD/some-observations-on-alcoholism\">posting</a> my article on alcoholism, I have, somewhat in the background, been trying to organize an EA recovery group with a few other interested people. This group would, ideally, be broadly defined and include alcoholism, which so far seems like the most common problem, but also other addictions, either to drugs, or more behavioral ones such as eating disorders. We have not had any meetings yet, but I have set up a Discord server which can be accessed here:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://discord.gg/7UxgmnyWM5\">https://discord.gg/7UxgmnyWM5</a></p>\n<p>Based on a poll I set up, I am leaning towards 5:00 PM EST July 25th as our initial meeting time. This meeting is meant more to discuss logistics and administration than to be a conventional group therapy meeting of any kind, although it might drift in that direction at points as well. So far I have not set any explicit rules, and don\u2019t want to before our first meeting, when I can get input from others. Given this, I am hoping no one does anything particularly ban-worthy before this time, as I will have to judge/get input on a case by case basis, and will prefer to start with warnings barring obviously intentional bad behavior. As a starting point, if you are EA or EA adjacent and have an addiction like one of those mentioned in the beginning, consider yourself invited. When the final rules are put in place I will likely more formally restrict it, and in the meantime I would prefer that you only come onto the server if you are, suspect you are, or have struggled with an addiction in the past. I will most likely also be welcoming to people with professional mental/community health experience, but before discussing the rules in a meeting, I would prefer that people who have a more impersonal interest in this project don\u2019t join right away. I do not plan to enforce this before the rules are set however, so long as you behave well. I am only posting this link while the project is still so half-baked because I would prefer to have more people present at an initial meeting where important matters of this sort are decided, rather than a small handful of the people who will eventually want to join. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me through my DMs.</p>\n", "user": {"username": "Devin Kalish"}}, {"_id": "shztqG5X4uRnAj2Mc", "title": "Everything is one whole", "postedAt": "2023-07-19T22:13:02.468Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Biggest geniuses that ever lived thought that everything is one whole (Nietzsche, Goethe, Schopenhauer). Even nothing can be proven ultimately and everything is based on some assumptions. There are convincing arguments and data to support this! Most ppl are overly positive and weak, and their sub-consciousness protects them as we didn't evolve to find out the truth! 160IQ in 4 areas of science and does philosophy told me i am extremely intelligent! I Am used to not to be taken seriously!</p><p>To give some examples:</p><p>\u201cAnd do you know what \u201cthe world\u201d is to me? Shall I show it to you in my mirror? This world: a monster of energy, without beginning, without end; a firm, iron magnitude of force that does not grow bigger or smaller, that does not expend itself but only transforms itself; as a whole, of unalterable size, a household without expenses or losses, but likewise without increase or income; enclosed by \u201cnothingness\u201d as by a boundary; not something blurry or wasted, not something endlessly extended, but set in a definite space as a definite force, and not a space that might be \u201cempty\u201d here or there, but rather as force throughout, as a play of forces and waves of forces, at the same time one and many, increasing here and at the same time decreasing there; a sea of forces flowing and rushing together, eternally changing, eternally flooding back, with tremendous years of recurrence, with an ebb and a flood of its forms; out of the simplest forms striving toward the most complex, out of the stillest, most rigid, coldest forms striving toward the hottest, most turbulent, most self-contradictory, and then again returning home to the simple out of this abundance, out of the play of contradictions back to the joy of concord, still affirming itself in this uniformity of its courses and its years, blessing itself as that which must return eternally, as a becoming that knows no satiety, no disgust, no weariness: this, my Dionysian world of the eternally self- creating, the eternally self-destroying, this mystery world of the twofold voluptuous delight, my \u201cbeyond good and evil,\u201d without goal, unless the joy of the circle is itself a goal; without will, unless a ring feels good will toward itself\u2014 do you want a name for this world? A solution for all of its riddles? A light for you, too, you best-concealed, strongest, most intrepid, most midnightly men?\u2014 This world is the will to power\u2014and nothing besides! And you yourselves are also this will to power\u2014and nothing besides!\u201d - Nietzsche</p><p><a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51356/51356-h/51356-h.htm\">https://www.gutenberg.org/files/51356/51356-h/51356-h.htm</a></p><p>chapter 17. music is a priory to our experiences, not abstract but thoroughly determinate, one can make sense exactly what is going on in any given situation by music on the background. Schopenhauer argue it is because it is direct representation of will, instead of just copy of it, like in other arts like painting... Even there is no thing in itself, everything is in relation!</p><p>Whereas both philosophers argue that everything is this primordial unity! <a href=\"https://www.fau.edu/athenenoctua/pdfs/Lori%20Dilican.pdf\">https://www.fau.edu/athenenoctua/pdfs/Lori%20Dilican.pdf</a>&nbsp;</p><p>Nietzsche predicted findings from QM... Even will to power wasn't still empirically proven... These geniuses agree on that everything is one whole!</p><p>It is interesting to note, someone high IQ messaged me that Sonya Falck did international high IQ interviews and supposedly these ppl experience same feelings as me: oneness with everything, timelessness and feelings of infinity, or totality of existence! I didn't have time to read her book, i have severe chronic pain, so i returned it... 160IQ (extremely intelligent one) told me there is something more going on...</p><p>We had same experiences even, we were both emperors in egypt and millions bowed to us...</p><p>Also even this might not mean much, because it could still be trillions of ways and we are infantile. Check Wheeler's participatory universe and there are many more theories of sorts going in this direction... Still science uses consciousness today and it even helps solve problems in science assuming everything is consciousness...</p><p>I had divine mania i am intense on whole OE spectrum, my ex-mensa psychologist told me that is really possible no one under 160IQ can understand me. Even he told me that I have experiences which are at peak of human existence, that it is extreme. I witnessed suffering of whole world like it would almost happened to me, i am empath, i tend to suck others ppls emotions in...</p><p>I can't prove this empirically, but i have my own reasons why i fear this!</p><p>Because if we don't strop torturing each other and won't make it like a game/sport, fun for everyone, we should try elevate other ppl with us instead of pushing them down...</p><p>Also it is sad many gifted ppl do only science and then they wonder they are burn out, or think philosophy doesn't make progress, while science is based on these humanities and philosophy even lead to creation of computers and figured out that math is not even language of math, &nbsp;some ppl believe it uncritically, because IQ alone doesn't help you make better decisions, or to be rational...</p><p>But i saw things beyond comprehension and things saw before I Read them, it is crazy! &nbsp;It is beyond metaphorical language, i couldn't never explain this in words!</p><p>Hackers should send in spam about free will and this and local/global political issues, or corporate crime... Free will is also illusion, even some ppl don't want to believe it, because their life would lose meaning.. But only biggest geniuses in history all thought so you know... Even we can't even tackle this problem, because our language and imagination is imperfect to describe reality, free will is just absurd!</p><p>Everyone should realize everything is one and stop torturing each other, instead elevate each other is my point! Otherwise we will suffer infinitely and create hell for us.</p><p>I don't expect anyone can give constructive arguments, or discuss this without calling names, but i needed to say it. Most ppl are motivated only by biological factors (ego), or (social) and don't have their own mind, which is cause of ceaseless striving!</p><p>Again i am not trying to prove this, it is unprovable! I try to give convincing case, that we should care, otherwise we are risking creating infinite hell... Ppl grow more insensitive and cruel towards each other and exploit others. Even will to power is mainly (psychological interpretation), it doesn't matter, ppl use morals just to get to power... And Nietzsche was right on so many things. ppl don't want to see that because it is too harsh... Like someone sold to homeless man on wheelchair faulty phone, or ppl are able to pin murder on their own brother just to get money...</p><p>I witnessed suffering of whole world since history of mankind, i was like static rock, observed whole history! I saw everything ppl did to each other from all reasons... I have amnesia i can't recall almost anything, but it was something more than just seeing too much... I had existential feelings since i was kid and i am exceptionally perceptive!</p><p>Someone even sent me this Nietzsche quote, it is uncanny, Nietzsche almost prophesized my whole life ahead also, i can't put this into language and it is not just that i would be delusional (i realized somethings yet before i read them):</p><p>\u201cAnyone who manages to experience the history of humanity as a whole as his own history will feel in an enormously generalized way all the grief of an invalid who thinks of health, of an old man who thinks of the dream of his youth, of a lover deprived of his beloved, of the martyr whose ideal is perishing, of the hero on the evening after a battle that has decided nothing but brought him wounds and the loss of his friend. But if one endured, if one could endure this immense sum of grief of all kinds while yet being the hero who, as the second day of battle breaks, welcomes the dawn and his fortune, being a person whose horizon encompasses thousands of years, past and future, being the heir of all the nobility of all past spirit - an heir with a sense of obligation, the most aristocratic of old nobles and at the same time the first of a new nobility - the like of which no age has yet seen or dreamed of; if one could burden one\u2019s soul with all of this - the oldest, the newest, losses, hopes, conquests, and the victories of humanity; if one could finally contain all this in one soul and crowd it into a single feeling - this would surely have to result in a happiness that humanity has not known so far: the happiness of a god full of power and love, full of tears and laughter, a happiness that, like the sun in the evening, continually bestows its inexhaustible riches, pouring them into the sea, feeling richest, as the sun does, only when even the poorest fishermen is still rowing with golden oars! This godlike feeling would then be called - humaneness.\u201d<br>&nbsp;</p><p>\u2015 <strong>Friedrich Nietzsche, </strong><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/2382792\"><strong>The Gay Science: With a Prelude in Rhymes and an Appendix of Songs</strong></a></p>", "user": {"username": "KArax"}}, {"_id": "effHArfrXnrRqpuAg", "title": "O mundo \u00e9 horr\u00edvel.

And in meta-analytic evidence, the <a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2008-07548-000\">effect size of psychotherapy</a> is approximately 0.8 in comparison to no treatment \u2014 and that\u2019s conventionally considered a large effect size. Another way to say this would be that in comparison to not getting therapy, getting therapy explains 14%ish of the outcomes in randomised controlled trials. 14% might not sound great, depending on what your priors are, but this is actually really good for healthcare: it\u2019s on par with or better than effects of medications, both psychiatric and medically, and it\u2019s superior to plenty of medical interventions that are considered effective.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> What do we know about how effective different types of therapy are? Are those compared in studies?</p><p><strong>Hannah Boettcher:</strong> Yes, these are definitely compared head to head. And something that\u2019s really interesting here is that specific treatment ingredients or therapeutic \u201cmodalities\u201d are actually not strong predictors of better outcomes in psychotherapy.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Right, this is a thing I\u2019ve actually heard before, and it basically totally blew my mind. I don\u2019t know where I got it, but I just really strongly had the impression that CBT, for example, was like a much more evidence-backed therapeutic approach than some others. So is it that any kind of therapy is just equally good, or is it that there are other things that explain variation in how helpful people find therapy?</p><p><strong>Hannah Boettcher:</strong> Well, you\u2019re definitely not alone in having that impression. Academic psychology and practicing clinicians don\u2019t do a great job of communicating this idea that different modalities don\u2019t predict better outcomes. And CBT is an example where there happens to be a tremendous literature on CBT being efficacious, but that\u2019s not the same thing as saying that it\u2019s better than all other modalities. So what\u2019s going on here is that there are <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_factors_theory\">other factors</a> that contribute more to outcome, basically, and they don\u2019t seem tethered to exactly what modality is being done.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Yeah. That\u2019s wild. Can you say what those other factors are?</p><p><strong>Hannah Boettcher:</strong> Yeah. Most of it is related to the therapeutic relationship. There\u2019s the therapeutic alliance, which is like a sense of being collaborative and on the same team with your therapist. Empathy is huge here, a big predictor of outcome is the client perceiving their therapist as empathetic. Similarly, a sense of genuineness, trustworthiness, and engagement. And expectancy is really important too. So the client going in and thinking, \u201cThis has a chance of helping me,\u201d and having a coherent story about how that might be the case.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Right, OK. So it kind of sounds like: Do you like your therapist? Do you get on and trust them? Do they seem genuine and authentic to you? Do you feel like they care about you? And then do you think it could help you? Like, do you think it\u2019s going to work?</p><p><strong>Hannah Boettcher:</strong> And all of this cashes out in greater engagement and input and retention, where the client is sort of actively participating in their therapy.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Moral demandingness and slack</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Hannah Boettcher:</strong> I think we have to acknowledge that we are under conditions where in fact there is not a fully satisfactory choice available: we\u2019re in a universe where tradeoffs exist, we have finite resources, we have multiple things we care about, and we have incomplete information. So we have to make guesses and take risks \u2014 and that hurts. So I think self-compassion and acceptance come in here, like, \u201cDamn, I so am wishing this were not the case, and by golly, it looks like it still is.\u201d And then I think that it\u2019s a matter of recognising that we aren\u2019t going to score 100% on any unitary definition of \u201crightness.\u201d And then recognise that, \u201cWell, I could just look at that and stall out forever, or I could make some moves.\u201d And probably making moves is preferable to stalling out.</p><p><strong>Hannah Boettcher:</strong> This is a belief, actually, that I struggle with, that\u2019s like: \u201cIf there is capacity left on the table, there has been a moral error.\u201d I mean, it\u2019s really quite a defensible position. The logic is like, \u201cI do, in fact, wish to use resources for a purpose. Look, some unused ones: we should allocate them.\u201d</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Yes. Concretely, I very much have this if it\u2019s the end of a workday, and I have any more energy and I\u2019m not totally spent, I could obviously do a bit more work. Or just money: like, if I have any savings, that feels wrong. And then what do we do?</p><p><strong>Hannah Boettcher:</strong> Well, I think we have to get clear on two things that are true here alongside the very appealing philosophy proof. One is that following that rule positions you to be in a constant state of <i>just barely OK</i>, right? Like, every time you get a unit of mental health from the wellness factory and you\u2019re like, \u201cImmediately distribute to impact!\u201d then you\u2019re basically almost empty, or like a little bit in the red all of the time. And that\u2019s just very risky and costly. It\u2019s obviously painful, but it\u2019s also going to put you at risk for burnout and for needing to take longer breaks to basically recover and care for yourself.</p><p>It\u2019s also, in my view, needlessly painful as a matter of subjective wellbeing, to be in a constant insufficiency state. Every time you have a sense of ease, if you\u2019re rehearsing, \u201cThere\u2019s been a moral error,\u201d this is just a terrible way to live as a matter of your own internal experience.</p><p>This is a hard one though. It feels <i>so</i> compelling. And the thing I remind myself of is that that feeling of compellingness is simply an incomplete description of what\u2019s true. It does feel really compelling to use 100% of my capacity, and I do really feel that urge to allocate capacity whenever it shows up. But if and when I ever do this \u2014 which I do occasionally try versions of it \u2014 I end up feeling the effects, and it is not preferable. It\u2019s almost like I have to tell myself, \u201cYou\u2019re not well calibrated on this. You think that you want zero slack and ease, but you want an amount.\u201d</p><p><strong>Hannah Boettcher:</strong> So yeah, what\u2019s the cost here? The cost is that I look at my calendar, and part of my mind is like, \u201cYou could do more. It kind of looks like you want to just have fun and chill.\u201d And I kind of have to unhook from that thought, and just be like, \u201cI see you. I see what you\u2019re pointing at. You\u2019re naming something that matters. And by the way, workability is also here.\u201d So it\u2019s an ongoing balance.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Self compassion</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> I have to admit that I, for a long time, have just really bounced off the idea of self-compassion and off of compassion-focused therapy. It came up a number of times, and I kept being like, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t want to do that.\u201d My reaction to the idea of being more compassionate toward myself was like, that sounds like lowering my standards or letting myself off the hook or like some kind of over-the-top self-care that I don\u2019t identify with. A little bit of like, \u201cThat sounds weak. I want to be strong.\u201d</p><p><strong>Hannah Boettcher:</strong> Yeah. That sounds like things I\u2019ve heard inside my head and from clients before.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> OK, so it\u2019s not just me. To some extent, I\u2019ve made some progress on this. I don\u2019t have those associations quite as strongly. But for listeners who do still have some of that, can you help us have a different framing?</p><p><strong>Hannah Boettcher:</strong> Absolutely. The thing we\u2019re aiming for is not \u201canything goes\u201d or \u201cmy standards don\u2019t matter.\u201d The thing we\u2019re aiming for is: No matter where I\u2019ve set the standard, how can I show up for treating myself well and kindly and effectively along the way?</p><p>And let\u2019s also be clear that self-compassion is actually useful. First of all, it\u2019s justified. We\u2019ve said this already: we are the sorts of creatures that suffer, and we suffer for reasons out of our control that we didn\u2019t choose. In my view, that justifies compassion. But even separately from that, self-compassion works better than self-loathing and self-berating. When you\u2019re in a constant state of self-criticism, this is kicking up additional suffering that you then have to metabolise. Whereas when you can relate as a matter of self-compassion, this actually enhances performance more than self-criticism does, and it makes for a better subjective experience.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> A better experience. Yeah, OK. That sounds totally right. Then I guess we\u2019ve got to go all-in on self-compassion. Something more like: You are doing something super important, super brave, super valuable. Thank you for doing it.</p><p><strong>Hannah Boettcher:</strong> Yes, yes. And you are materially creating a world where a lot of people are pushing toward impact, and that is worth being part of.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Why effective altruism can amplify imposter syndrome</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Hannah Boettcher:</strong> I also think there are some cultural norms that are common in high-impact spaces that can amplify imposter syndrome a bit. So the sorts of questions that people are well-practiced asking about their projects \u2014 like: Where are the top problems? Which of these is neglected? How could we be doing better? If we\u2019re doing things that aren\u2019t a value add, we need to stop doing them \u2014 these sorts of questions that are useful for impact can easily start being applied to the self, where they pull for a deficit frame.</p><p>Then there\u2019s also this sort of cultural norm or virtue around self-critique and humility. So if you\u2019re complimented for your work, somebody in a high-impact space is probably going to be ready with an internal \u201cYeah, but\u2026\u201d Right? Because that\u2019s a move that\u2019s really well-practiced in these spaces.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Totally. Just to dig in a bit more on a few of those things, some people are trying to do <i>a lot</i> of good, and some people are trying to do <i>the most good</i> they can \u2014 and in either case, maybe much more than is typical, we end up asking things like: Is what we\u2019re doing good enough? Could we be doing more good? Do we have the right beliefs, or could we have the right<i>er</i> beliefs? Is this project that I\u2019m working on going fine? How can I guess all the ways it could go wrong, so that it could go better?</p><p>And I guess it\u2019s such an optimisation framing that ending up anywhere below optimal \u2014 which we don\u2019t even know what optimal is, oftentimes, so it\u2019s often pretty easy to tell a story where we are below optimal \u2014 then we\u2019re setting ourselves up to feel inadequate, I guess.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> I think I both stand by the goal of trying to find ways to do better and to do more good. But how do you do that in a way that doesn\u2019t also end up making you feel kind of chronically inadequate? Because you could always have done the project better or you could always be kind of reflecting more on your beliefs to make sure that you\u2019ve got the right ideas about what the most pressing problems are or something.</p><p><strong>Hannah Boettcher:</strong> I think we are aiming for a place where we can decouple the scorecard from our worthiness. So it\u2019s of course the case that in trying to optimise the good, we will always be falling short, right? The question is how much, and in what ways are we not there yet? And if we then extrapolate that to how much and in what ways am <i>I</i> not enough, that\u2019s where we run into trouble.

Me parece bem intuitivo que devamos ajudar as pessoas com necessidade se pudermos; que n\u00e3o devemos dar uma prefer\u00eancia aleat\u00f3ria a uns grupos em detrimento de outros; que preferir\u00edamos ajudar mais pessoas e n\u00e3o menos se pud\u00e9ssemos, e que n\u00e3o temos tempo e dinheiro infinitos.</p><p>Na verdade, eu iria mais al\u00e9m \u2014 diria que nos sentir\u00edamos bastante desconfort\u00e1veis ao tentar&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000horas.com.br/glossario/#teste-de-reversao\">defender as posi\u00e7\u00f5es contr\u00e1rias</a>&nbsp;se estiv\u00e9ssemos conversando com algu\u00e9m, dizendo:</p><ol><li>Ajudar outras pessoas em dificuldade n\u00e3o \u00e9 moralmente obrigat\u00f3rio, importante ou mesmo bom.</li><li>Tudo bem se eu valorizar as pessoas de forma diferente dependendo das suas diferen\u00e7as discricion\u00e1rias como etnia, sexo, aptid\u00e3o etc.</li><li>N\u00e3o importa que algumas pessoas morram mesmo que n\u00e3o me custasse muito para salvar suas vidas.</li><li>Temos recursos ilimitados.</li></ol><p>Entende o que eu digo?</p><p>N\u00e3o temos dinheiro suficiente, ent\u00e3o sempre precisamos escolher a causa mais merecedora para apoiar.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EtKoHrbBrHEbqtjSq/dndqvgknksz9y4wuxfcm\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EtKoHrbBrHEbqtjSq/dndqvgknksz9y4wuxfcm 1024w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EtKoHrbBrHEbqtjSq/imql3qywd6ox4lepxwun 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EtKoHrbBrHEbqtjSq/tplmlqhyft3vnxxhtkyb 768w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EtKoHrbBrHEbqtjSq/cddq8kdmqfzthp0p9h3s 1299w\"></p><p>Se concordarmos que essas quatro ideias simbolizam valores importantes \u2014 e acho que concordamos \u2014 ent\u00e3o s\u00e3o grandes as implica\u00e7\u00f5es sobre a maneira como devemos pensar em fazer o bem. Na verdade, isso significa que o jeito como normalmente pensamos em fazer o bem est\u00e1 errado.</p><p>Para sermos fieis a esses valores, precisamos pensar sobre como podemos ajudar o maior n\u00famero de pessoas com nossos recursos limitados.</p><p>Isso \u00e9 crucial porque existem <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/cause-areas\">algumas causas</a>&nbsp;com as quais podemos gerar um grande impacto investindo uma quantia pequena de dinheiro. Na verdade, as melhores op\u00e7\u00f5es s\u00e3o <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/effective-or-not/\">muito, muito melhores do que a m\u00e9dia</a>&nbsp;\u2014 ou mesmo centenas de vezes melhores. Isso pode significar a diferen\u00e7a entre ajudar uma pessoa, e ajudar centenas de pessoas <i>com exatamente a mesma quantidade de tempo ou dinheiro</i>.</p><p>Uma a\u00e7\u00e3o de caridade escolhida aleatoriamente <i>muito provavelmente pode n\u00e3o estar surtindo um impacto t\u00e3o grande quanto as&nbsp;<u> institui\u00e7\u00f5es de caridade mais eficazes</u></i>&nbsp;(na verdade, muitas causas que decidimos apoiar tendem a ser resultado de uma escolha aleat\u00f3ria ou de fatores sist\u00eamicos que significam que estamos apenas expostos a elas).</p><p>E isso \u00e9 relevante, porque, se n\u00e3o escolhemos bem, ou n\u00e3o estamos dando \u00e0s pessoas um tratamento igualit\u00e1rio (ou seja, estamos implicitamente discriminando alguns grupos de pessoas) ou n\u00e3o estamos ajudando todas as pessoas que podemos (ou seja, permitimos que gente demais sofra ou morra, mesmo que possamos ajud\u00e1-las).</p><p>Assim, a princ\u00edpio, cada causa digna \u2014 desde uma pesquisa sobre o c\u00e2ncer, passando por justi\u00e7a clim\u00e1tica, santu\u00e1rios animais e at\u00e9 preven\u00e7\u00e3o de doen\u00e7as <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charities/sci-foundation\">facilmente trat\u00e1veis mas impronunci\u00e1veis</a> em locais que provavelmente nunca visitaremos \u2014 deve ser uma carta na mesa\u2026&nbsp;<i>exceto</i> se tamb\u00e9m pensamos que seja melhor ajudar mais pessoas e entendemos que n\u00e3o temos recursos suficientes para ajudar todo mundo. Com isso, primeiro devemos focar nas causas com as quais podemos ajudar o maior n\u00famero de pessoas com nosso tempo e dinheiro limitados, <strong>n\u00e3o apenas aquelas pessoas sobre as quais j\u00e1 ouvimos falar</strong>.</p><p>Pode ser muito dif\u00edcil tentar ser neutro em rela\u00e7\u00e3o a uma causa. A maioria das pessoas j\u00e1 passou por uma experi\u00eancia pr\u00f3pria de perda: perdi dois familiares para a leucemia; assisti a doen\u00e7a consumir seus corpos e os analg\u00e9sicos emba\u00e7ar suas mentes, e vivi o luto pela morte deles. \u00c9 bastante aceit\u00e1vel que isso nos fa\u00e7a querer doar para organismos numa tentativa de revolver aquele problema espec\u00edfico ou buscar a cura para a doen\u00e7a que nos roubou nossos entes queridos. Somos criaturas emp\u00e1ticas, e n\u00e3o queremos que outras pessoas passem pelo sofrimento que tivemos, nem que seus entes queridos vivam o mesmo luto.</p><p>Mas, se nos preocupamos em tratar as <i>pessoas</i> com igualdade, tamb\u00e9m dever\u00edamos tentar tratar suas experi\u00eancias da mesma forma. N\u00e3o existe um bom motivo pelo qual eu deva preferir evitar a morte, incapacita\u00e7\u00e3o e sofrimento causados por uma doen\u00e7a espec\u00edfica (como a leucemia) mais do que deveria me preocupar com o sofrimento provocado por mal\u00e1ria, tuberculose, acidentes de tr\u00e2nsito ou qualquer outra coisa. O que interessa \u00e9 que vidas s\u00e3o abreviadas, pais s\u00e3o privados do conv\u00edvio com seus filhos, pessoas est\u00e3o vivendo com dor. Demonstrar preocupa\u00e7\u00e3o igual significa tratar <i>toda </i>morte ou sofrimento como uma trag\u00e9dia, n\u00e3o apenas aquela provocada por doen\u00e7as espec\u00edficas com as quais convivemos \u2014 por um acaso cruel do destino que as colocou no nosso campo de vis\u00e3o.</p><p>Tomar essas decis\u00f5es \u00e9 muito, mas muito dif\u00edcil. Entretanto, existe um conjunto de ferramentas de racioc\u00ednio que podemos utilizar para nos ajudar. Essa forma de pensar se chama&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ethics.org.au/on-ethics/blog/january-2016/effective-altruism\">altru\u00edsmo eficaz</a>. \u00c9 quase o mesmo que o altru\u00edsmo comum (pois enfatiza a import\u00e2ncia de ajudar outras pessoas) \u2014 a palavra \u2018eficaz\u2019 significa apenas tentar pensar claramente sobre como nossas a\u00e7\u00f5es podem ajudar o <i>maior n\u00famero de pessoas</i>, ou fazer um <i>bem maior</i>.</p><p>Vejo o altru\u00edsmo eficaz como um meio de poder viver melhor com os <strong>valores que j\u00e1 temos</strong>.</p><p>Esse modo de pensar se aplica a qualquer meio pelo qual possamos querer fazer o bem \u2014 seja uma manifesta\u00e7\u00e3o em favor de uma mudan\u00e7a pol\u00edtica, a escolha sobre onde doar o dinheiro ou como provocar um grande impacto com nossas profiss\u00f5es.</p><p>Num mundo com tantas causas dignas nas quais podemos trabalhar, isso nos mostra uma sa\u00edda para a paralisia das decis\u00f5es, sistematicamente procurando maneiras para fazer o maior bem com o tempo e recursos limitados.</p><p>Isso nos leva a encarar algumas decis\u00f5es dif\u00edceis. Mas, lembre-se, de qualquer forma estamos fazendo escolhas quer pensemos nelas ou n\u00e3o. Mesmo que seja dif\u00edcil n\u00e3o doar para alguma causa que parece realmente importante \u2014 seja por motivos pessoais ou porque voc\u00ea foi convencido por um discurso de marketing para caridade \u2014 lembre-se que voc\u00ea est\u00e1 sempre abrindo m\u00e3o de outras causas dignas.</p><p>Veja um exemplo disso.

Isso significa investir um tempo substancial em fazer delibera\u00e7\u00f5es e reflex\u00f5es sobre as pr\u00f3prias cren\u00e7as, estar sempre aberto e curioso por novas evid\u00eancias e argumentos e estar pronto para mudar os pontos de vista muito radicalmente.</p><p><strong>Esp\u00edrito colaborativo:</strong> \u00e9 poss\u00edvel alcan\u00e7ar mais trabalhando juntos e para fazer isso de maneira eficaz \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio atingir altos padr\u00f5es de honestidade, amizade e perspectiva de comunidade.

A metodologia do The Economist compara o n\u00famero excedente de mortes com a m\u00e9dia peri\u00f3dica, para estimar no total quantas outras pessoas morreram e ajustar as subnotifica\u00e7\u00f5es.<br>As mortes provocadas tanto pela pandemia quanto por terrorismo t\u00eam uma cauda pesada, portanto, as taxas de morte anteriores normalmente subestimar\u00e3o a magnitude do risco.<br>Por exemplo, \u00e9 poss\u00edvel que os terroristas lancem uma arma nuclear em uma grande cidade, o que poderia matar mais de 1 milh\u00e3o de pessoas. Isso n\u00e3o aconteceu nos \u00faltimos cinquenta anos, mas teria sido a principal causa da taxa de mortalidade se tivesse ocorrido. Da mesma forma, poderia ter ocorrido uma pandemia muito pior do que a COVID-19 ou a HIV/AIDS nos \u00faltimos 50&nbsp; anos.<br>A quest\u00e3o chave ent\u00e3o \u00e9 se o registro hist\u00f3rico \u00e9 uma subestima\u00e7\u00e3o do risco de terrorismo ou de pandemia (ou seja, se as mortes por terrorismo t\u00eam uma cauda mais pesada do que as mortes por pandemia).<br>Parece plaus\u00edvel que o pior cen\u00e1rio da pandemia seja pior do que o do terrorismo. N\u00e3o h\u00e1 nada que possa excluir o surgimento de uma pandemia mais infecciosa do que a COVID-19, mas com uma taxa de fatalidade de 10-50%, ou pior. E parece ter ocorrido outros quase-acidentes no registro hist\u00f3rico.<br>Ent\u00e3o, o problema de eventos com falta de cauda na amostra pode ter sido pior para a pandemia do que para o terrorismo. Na verdade, a maneira mais plaus\u00edvel para o terrorismo matar mais de 1 milh\u00e3o de pessoas \u00e9, provavelmente, por meio de uma pandemia.<br>Dado que o terrorismo recebe aprox. 100 vezes mais financiamento do que a preven\u00e7\u00e3o a pandemias, enquanto parece que, historicamente, a pandemia tenha provocado 10 a 100 vezes mais mortes, as corre\u00e7\u00f5es deveriam ser bem mais pesadas em favor do terrorismo para que a aloca\u00e7\u00e3o de recursos atual pare\u00e7a mais equilibrada.<br>A an\u00e1lise acima foi feita em termos de n\u00famero de mortes, pois essa \u00e9 uma m\u00e9trica importante, mas relativamente bem mensur\u00e1vel. As mortes tanto por pandemia quanto por terrorismo tamb\u00e9m produzem custos indiretos importantes, e uma compara\u00e7\u00e3o ampla precisaria considerar a escala relativa de cada uma delas.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnl8itdtfxpho\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefl8itdtfxpho\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>\u201c40,1 milh\u00f5es [33,6 milh\u00f5es a 48,6milh\u00f5es] de pessoas morreram de doen\u00e7as relacionadas \u00e0 AIDS desde o in\u00edcio da epidemia.\u201d <a href=\"https://www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet\">Global HIV &amp; AIDS statistics \u2014 Fact sheet</a> UNAIDS, 2022. <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220811142820/https:/www.unaids.org/en/resources/fact-sheet\">Link arquivado</a>, acesso em: 11 ago. 2022.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnqyulbxkf9ns\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefqyulbxkf9ns\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>A Open Philanthropy \u00e9 uma funda\u00e7\u00e3o inspirada no altru\u00edsmo eficaz.

Plenty of other people have written about similar or related ideas, and about alternative or conflicting views.</p><p><strong>Epistemic effort: </strong>Ideas developed slowly over about 3 years, via learning ML, playing with language models, reading work by others, and discussing language model capabilities with various people. I've had a few recent discussions particularly related to the ideas below. About 1 hour of writing and editing this before posting.</p><p>Thoughtful feedback on this post is very welcome!</p><ul><li>Language models trained on next-token prediction learn to model text-generating processes. The data that they are trained on - mainly massive internet text corpuses - encode a lot of information about the causal structure of the world.&nbsp;<ul><li>For instance, there is a lot of text online about objects falling when people let go of them, which allows language models to learn the basics of how gravity works. Further, there is text about what happens when things are dropped on the Moon or the ISS, and about Newtonian mechanics, and about general relativity, etc., so language models can learn how gravity works in a much deeper and more general way than that too.</li></ul></li><li>Since the processes that generated the text on the Internet are so diverse, language models have the potential to model a large amount of the causal structure of the world.</li><li>The limit of performance at next-token prediction, and text-generation process modeling, is far superhuman. The argument for this that I found most convincing was the following passage from <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nH4c3Q9t9F3nJ7y8W/gpts-are-predictors-not-imitators\">GPTs are Predictors, not Imitators</a> by Eliezer Yudkowsky:</li></ul><blockquote><p>Imagine somebody telling you to make up random words, and you say, \"Morvelkainen bloombla ringa mongo.\"</p><p>Imagine a mind of a level - where, to be clear, I'm not saying GPTs are at this level yet -</p><p>Imagine a Mind of a level where it can hear you say 'morvelkainen blaambla ringa', and maybe also read your entire social media history, and then manage to assign 20% probability that your next utterance is 'mongo'.</p><p>The fact that this Mind could double as a really good actor playing your character, does not mean They are only exactly as smart as you.</p><p>When <i>you're </i>trying to be human-equivalent at writing text, you can just make up whatever output, and it's now a human output because you're human and you chose to output that.</p><p>GPT-4 is being asked to <i>predict </i>all that stuff you're making up. It doesn't get to make up whatever. It is being asked to model what you were thinking - the thoughts in your mind whose shadow is your text output - so as to assign as much probability as possible to your true next word.</p></blockquote><ul><li>The above example is only showing that the limit of performance on next-token prediction is far superhuman; it is not clear that scaling current methods will achieve anything close to this limit behavior.</li><li>There is a spectrum of things that could be going on under the hood in language models. You could consider the most capable end of this spectrum as to be \"modeling the entire causal structure of the world.\" On the lower end, you might find highly reductive views like \"LLM's are just stochastic parrots that repeat back things they've seen humans say on the internet.\" (In fact, there are probably many dimensions along which we are unsure what language models are doing; I am just highlighting that I find this dimension of \"amount of causal structure learned\" useful.)</li><li>Then we should ask ourselves, where on this spectrum are current systems? Where do we expect near future systems to be?<ul><li>Language models definitely sometimes implement algorithms internally to perform tasks, rather than memorizing answers. The algorithm discovered for how GPT-2 small performs the task of indirect object identification in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.00593\">this paper</a> is a concrete example of this.</li><li>I've been <a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/share/17f4bbdb-8309-40f4-b784-d4e51a4ef2de\">unable to get GPT-4 to play tic-tac-toe well</a>, and I know at least some other people have also tried and failed. This was surprising to me - it feels like the \"causal structure\" of tic-tac-toe is very simple, and GPT-4 can talk about strategies for tic-tac-toe, but when it actually plays it fails to keep track of what is going on and almost always loses, even when it is told to play carefully and reason out loud.<ul><li>Of course, it could easily be finetuned to play tic-tac-toe well, but I think this can be interpreted as one data point for where the model lies on the \"learned causal structure\" spectrum, and it points in the direction of \"not a lot.\"</li></ul></li><li>That tic-tac-toe data point should not be taken as the whole picture by any means. GPT-4's coding ability on tasks that require generalization from code that is on the internet is very impressive (at least in my opinion and the opinion of many others).</li><li>I'd like to have a larger collection of important examples that help round out this picture of how much causal structure language models have learned. I have intuitions that I've built by playing around with LLM's (mainly ChatGPT 3.5 and 4) and reading about behaviors other people have elicited, but I would like to distill them into a deeper understanding based on a clear list of examples that I feel are safe to interpret in specific ways.</li></ul></li><li>Overall, I'm still quite uncertain about how much causal structure is being learned, but I tentatively think that it is a small enough amount that further algorithmic improvements and paradigm shifts are required before we achieve AGI. (This view of mine fluctuates rather often though.)</li><li>Even imitating humans can be very powerful. The question of how influential LLM-based systems can be if they are roughly human imitators is also one I find interesting. But I think this is probably quite different from AGI and superintelligence, and comes with considerably less X-risk.</li><li>Even if language models don't get us AGI, we could have AGI pretty soon. I fully expect people to continue working on improving algorithms, and to continue to make progress.</li><li>Even if AGI is pretty far away, we should be working on safety and alignment now.<ul><li>This does affect the kind of work that seems most useful though. Things that are too heavily based on current systems look worse, things that are robust to paradigm shifts look better.</li></ul></li></ul>", "user": {"username": "RohanS"}}, {"_id": "DNm5sbFogr9wvDasH", "title": "Thoughts on yesterday\u2019s UN Security Council meeting on AI", "postedAt": "2023-07-19T16:46:48.654Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DNm5sbFogr9wvDasH/qtiyuhskn2imlqpwn0h8\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DNm5sbFogr9wvDasH/o3uwle3glwsagfoololu 270w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DNm5sbFogr9wvDasH/m9bw5nuohcdzgohklvhm 540w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DNm5sbFogr9wvDasH/ltpkarizq4ju6cklouir 810w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DNm5sbFogr9wvDasH/atdsajlthfuthtemkeqb 1080w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DNm5sbFogr9wvDasH/clxil6z5uiddwvrutpsg 1350w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DNm5sbFogr9wvDasH/rpn7cegqvkzujsqj5g1j 1620w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DNm5sbFogr9wvDasH/dbm4djha3ghgwueuya2g 1890w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DNm5sbFogr9wvDasH/va4pdpefmmabjcnxh6il 2160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DNm5sbFogr9wvDasH/ns2rp4d3ilpkbw8ovvhu 2430w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DNm5sbFogr9wvDasH/eraheggxbmwagbnqqx4h 2632w\"></figure><p>Firstly, it\u2019s encouraging that AI is being <a href=\"https://media.un.org/en/asset/k1j/k1ji81po8p\">discussed</a> as a threat at the highest global body dedicated to ensuring global peace and security.

The app's core feature, \"Calm Me,\" provides users with a range of evidence-based exercises to help manage anxiety.</p><p>The app was developed by <a href=\"http://sparkwave.com/\">Spark Wave</a>, a startup foundry with a mission to create software companies that solve important problems. The idea for Mind Ease was born out of a desire to create a tool that could provide immediate, effective relief for people struggling with anxiety. The app's development process has been evidence-based since the outset\u2014from <a href=\"https://mindease.io/wellness-blog/making-mind-ease-users-opinions\">verifying the early prototype</a>, to monitoring <a href=\"https://mindease.io/wellness-blog/our-real-world-effectiveness\">internal measures of effectiveness</a> and the <a href=\"https://mindease.io/wellness-blog/mind-ease-our-cbt-modules\">development of CBT modules</a>.</p><p>We believe the potential impact of Mind Ease is significant. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/uHskkqWkwpjnvdLmQ/an-evaluation-of-mind-ease-an-anti-anxiety-app\">This independent evaluation</a> estimated \u201cthat Mind Ease counterfactually averts 0.25 DALY per user\u201d and up to \u201c4.07 DALY per user averted under optimistic assumptions\u201d.</p><p>Mind Ease has also been evaluated to be a promising investment from the impact perspective. This <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Ch5NZ7LhsY3mumMzn/ea-aligned-impact-investing-mind-ease-case-study\">case study</a> estimated that \u201can impact investment into Mind Ease averts DALYs at $150 per dollar invested in expectation, comparing favorably to GiveWell top charities before financial returns are taken into account.\u201d</p><h2><strong>What is happening now?</strong></h2><p>Mind Ease is currently undergoing a strategic pivot. One of the biggest lessons we've learned is that <strong>trying to be an app for everyone suffering from anxiety made us too generic and limited our reach, making it difficult to scale.</strong> We've realized that we can create more value and have a higher counterfactual impact by focusing on a more specific anxiety disorder.</p><p>To understand how we can better meet the needs of people with anxiety, we conducted an in-depth analysis using a weighted factor model. Through this process, we identified a significant gap in the realm of digital health interventions\u2014the limited attention given to panic attacks despite their widespread prevalence. In the US alone, more than <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1958997/\">20% of people</a> will experience a panic attack in their lifetime and as many as 4% will go on to develop panic disorder, suggesting a significant need for targeted interventions.</p><p>The digital health market has very few solutions for this population, and our current offering is already reasonably well-aligned with their needs. These two factors provide us with an <strong>opportunity for greater counterfactual impact</strong>.</p><p>We\u2019ll continue to advance the same <a href=\"https://mindease.io/mission\">core mission</a>\u2014<strong>to deliver highly accessible and effective mental health support worldwide</strong>. With a new direction we also have a higher chance of reaching financial sustainability as a social enterprise.</p><p>Throughout this pivot, we have continued to be highly focused on effectiveness, as shown by our <strong>ongoing RCT with researchers at the University of Oxford</strong>, which shows that our \u2018Calm Me\u2019 exercises are highly effective at reducing short-term anxiety.</p><p>As we keep working on the app, we're committed to refining our offering, expanding our reach, and continuously improving based on user feedback and outcomes of studies on the interventions we offer.</p><p>Looking ahead, we need to progress rapidly and demonstrate significant results to establish ourselves as a social enterprise in the digital health space focusing on panic attacks. Business success will allow us to deliver effective solutions to a larger audience in a cost-effective manner \u2014 fulfilling our ultimate aim to share the app for free with those who can\u2019t afford to pay for it.</p><p>This is a challenging endeavour, and we could really use your support.</p><h2><strong>What can you do to help?</strong></h2><p>We're reaching out to our community for two main types of support:</p><h3><strong>Success Stories</strong></h3><ul><li>If you <i>have used</i> Mind Ease and experienced positive results, we'd <strong>love to hear from you</strong>.

Introduction</h2><p>Incident reporting is a widely-used and generally accepted practice across many domains as a way to support safety practices. Incident reporting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://unesdoc.unesco.org/ark:/48223/pf0000384787\"><u>can help</u></a> \"expose problematic systems, improve (or in some cases, shut down) those systems, and seek redress\" for anyone harmed. When accidents are publicly disclosed, system designers are forced to address them and at least fix ongoing safety issues.</p><p>Incident reporting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15324\"><u>can be</u></a> \"vital for helping others avoid training risky systems, and for keeping AI developers accountable.\" Going forward, if other developers of AI systems can easily find past accidents and near misses, and see how they were addressed, they can better avoid similar incidents.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref76587sv1hj6\"><sup><a href=\"#fn76587sv1hj6\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;If there is an expectation that all incidents are reported, there is also an added motivation for model developers to avoid such incidents.</p><p><a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4491421\"><u>More broadly</u></a>, \"open, non-punitive reporting of accidents and near-misses is typically part of safety culture both instrumentally, and because reporting builds a norm of admitting mistakes, noticing them, and sharing lessons learned.\"</p><p>What is an 'incident' for AI? Different approaches, different typologies of incidents, and different sets of goals for reporting lead to defining \"incident\" more or less broadly.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvqj4yjfxwi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvqj4yjfxwi\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p>Governments can help support incident reporting in many ways, including by helping actors coordinate, requiring incident reporting in some cases, and by protecting actors from liability for voluntarily-reported incidents in some cases.</p><p>Incidents should probably include issues reported via bug bounty or responsible disclosure systems. Labs' bug bounty and responsible disclosure systems should cover model outputs in addition to security. See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5dKDLv4knhXLvNHT5/recommendation-bug-bounties-and-responsible-disclosure-for\"><u>Recommendation: Bug Bounties and Responsible Disclosure for Advanced ML Systems</u></a> (Vaniver 2023).</p><p>Information about some incidents is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/information-hazards.pdf\"><u>infohazardous</u></a> and should not be shared widely. In particular, sharing active security or misuse threats before they're fixed is dangerous, and sharing some incidents could risk advancing AI capabilities research on dangerous paths.</p><p>There's lots of great possible information-sharing for AI safety besides incident-reporting.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref10182678eco\"><sup><a href=\"#fn10182678eco\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p>Better records of AI incidents may also help to educate policymakers and the public about AI risk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>2. Recommendations</h2><p>Some mostly tentative and mostly underspecified ideas:</p><h3>Ideas for AI labs</h3><p>Labs&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.governance.ai/post/broad-expert-consensus-for-many-agi-safety-and-governance-best-practices\"><u>should</u></a>:</p><ul><li>\"<strong>Report safety incidents.</strong> AGI labs should report accidents and near misses to appropriate state actors and other AGI labs (e.g. via an AI incident database).\"<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftzkn1cz6jv9\"><sup><a href=\"#fntzkn1cz6jv9\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;They should also explain their responses to such incidents, if relevant.</li><li>\"<strong>Industry sharing of security information.</strong> AGI labs should share threat intelligence and information about security incidents with each other.\"</li><li>\"AGI labs should coordinate on best practices for incident reporting.\"</li></ul><p>Labs should also allow external audits of safety practices, including incident reporting.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpsqa8arzcwf\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpsqa8arzcwf\">[5]</a></sup></span></p><p>In addition to reporting the incidents they are aware of, labs should&nbsp;<i>try to notice</i> incidents. Incident reporting is only one part of broader&nbsp;<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4491421\"><u>safety culture</u></a>. In particular, labs should test and red-team their models to find undesired behavior, and they should monitor their model outputs and how users use models for undesired behavior.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxty88gxph4s\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxty88gxph4s\">[6]</a></sup></span></p><p>Some suggestions from \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n to operationalize incident reporting.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbol3qd1tmo4\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbol3qd1tmo4\">[7]</a></sup></span></p><p>Often regulatory programs are the result of or heavily influenced by prior industry-led efforts and voluntary standards (e.g. CFATS and the ACC), so it could be good for labs to develop an industry-wide voluntary standard program with wide stakeholder buy-in.</p><p>Stakeholders could set up an AI Information Sharing and Analysis Centre (ISAC) or integrate it under the Information Technology ISAC. An AI ISAC would handle information about AI accidents and best practices and could potentially even offer threat-mitigation services. Alternatively, an AI branch could be set up under the existing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.it-isac.org/\"><u>Information Technology ISAC</u></a> (IT ISAC), which specializes in strengthening information infrastructure resilience, operating a Threat Intelligence platform that enables automated sharing and threat analysis among member corporations of the IT ISAC.</p><p>We are not aware of an incident reporting policy at any major AI lab, nor of relevant plans or discussion. One of us has heard that some labs do track some incidents.</p><p>Governance researchers at labs sometimes write about incident reporting. In particular, OpenAI&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/research/language-model-safety-and-misuse\"><u>said</u></a> \"To support the study of language model misuse and mitigation thereof, we are actively exploring opportunities to share statistics on safety incidents this year, in order to concretize discussions about language model misuse\" (OpenAI 2022).

Readings &amp; quotes</h2><p>There are few sources focused on incident reporting for AI. The below quotes attempt to fully catalog everything relevant in these sources.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyrdmm03ifgr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyrdmm03ifgr\">[11]</a></sup></span></p><p>In roughly descending order of priority:</p><p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.07213.pdf#page=21\"><u>\"Sharing of AI Incidents\" in \"Toward Trustworthy AI Development: Mechanisms for Supporting Verifiable Claims\"</u></a> (Brundage et al. 2020):</p><blockquote><p><strong>Problem:</strong><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p><strong>Claims about AI systems can be scrutinized more effectively if there is common knowledge of the potential risks of such systems. However, cases of desired or unexpected behavior by AI systems are infrequently shared since it is costly to do unilaterally.</strong><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>Organizations can share AI \"incidents,\" or cases of undesired or unexpected behavior by an AI system that causes or could cause harm, by publishing case studies about these incidents from which others can learn. This can be accompanied by information about how they have worked to prevent future incidents based on their own and others' experiences.</p><p>By default, organizations developing AI have an incentive to primarily or exclusively report positive outcomes associated with their work rather than incidents. As a result, a skewed image is given to the public, regulators, and users about the potential risks associated with AI development.</p><p>The sharing of AI incidents can improve the verifiability of claims in AI development by highlighting risks that might not have otherwise been considered by certain actors. Knowledge of these risks, in turn, can then be used to inform questions posed to AI developers, increasing the effectiveness of external scrutiny. Incident sharing can also (over time, if used regularly) provide evidence that incidents are found and acknowledged by particular organizations, though additional mechanisms would be needed to demonstrate the completeness of such sharing.</p><p>AI incidents can include those that are publicly known and transparent, publicly known and anonymized, privately known and anonymized, or privately known and transparent. The Partnership on AI has begun building an AI incident-sharing database, called the AI Incident Database. The pilot was built using publicly available information through a set of volunteers and contractors manually collecting known AI incidents where AI caused harm in the real world.</p><p>Improving the ability and incentive of AI developers to report incidents requires building additional infrastructure, analogous to the infrastructure that exists for reporting incidents in other domains such as cybersecurity. Infrastructure to support incident sharing that involves non-public information would require the following resources:</p><ul><li>Transparent and robust processes to protect organizations from undue reputational harm brought about by the publication of previously unshared incidents. This could be achieved by anonymizing incident information to protect the identity of the organization sharing it. Other information-sharing methods should be explored that would mitigate reputational risk to organizations, while preserving the usefulness of information shared;</li><li>A trusted neutral third party that works with each organization under a non-disclosure agreement to collect and anonymize private information;</li><li>An organization that maintains and administers an online platform where users can easily access the incident database, including strong encryption and password protection for private incidents as well as a way to submit new information. This organization would not have to be the same as the third party that collects and anonymizes private incident data;</li><li>Resources and channels to publicize the existence of this database as a centralized resource, to accelerate both contributions to the database and positive uses of the knowledge from the database; and</li><li>Dedicated researchers who monitor incidents in the database in order to identify patterns and shareable lessons.</li></ul><p>The costs of incident sharing (e.g., public relations risks) are concentrated on the sharing organization, although the benefits are shared broadly by those who gain valuable information about AI incidents. Thus, a cooperative approach needs to be taken for incident sharing that addresses the potential downsides. A more robust infrastructure for incident sharing (as outlined above), including options for anonymized reporting, would help ensure that fear of negative repercussions from sharing does not prevent the benefits of such sharing from being realized.</p><p><strong>Recommendation: AI developers should share more information about AI incidents, including through collaborative channels.</strong><i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>Developers should seek to share AI incidents with a broad audience so as to maximize their usefulness, and take advantage of collaborative channels such as centralized incident databases as that infrastructure matures. In addition, they should move towards publicizing their commitment to (and procedures for) doing such sharing in a routine way rather than in an ad-hoc fashion, in order to strengthen these practices as norms within the AI development community.</p><p>Incident sharing is closely related to but distinct from responsible publication practices in AI and coordinated disclosure of cybersecurity vulnerabilities [<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.11274\"><u>55</u></a>]. Beyond implementation of progressively more robust platforms for incident sharing and contributions to such platforms, future work could also explore connections between AI and other domains in more detail, and identify key lessons from other domains in which incident sharing is more mature (such as the nuclear and cybersecurity industries).</p><p>Over the longer term, lessons learned from experimentation and research could crystallize into a mature body of knowledge on different types of AI incidents, reporting processes, and the costs associated with incident sharing. This, in turn, can inform any eventual government efforts to require or incentivize certain forms of incident reporting.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/12-tentative-ideas-for-us-ai-policy/\"><u>12 tentative ideas for US AI policy</u></a> (Muehlhauser 2023):</p><blockquote><p><strong>Require certain kinds of AI incident reporting</strong>, similar to incident reporting requirements in other industries (e.g. aviation) or to data breach reporting requirements, and similar to some vulnerability disclosure regimes.

Therefore, in the early stages of deployment, developers must . . . . Surface emerging model behaviours and risks via&nbsp;<strong>monitoring</strong> efforts. This could include direct monitoring of inputs and outputs to the model, and systems for incident reporting (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/research/language-model-safety-and-misuse\"><u>Brundage et al., 2022</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1145/3514094.3534181\"><u>Raji et al., 2022b</u></a>). . . .</p><p>Model evaluations will unlock four important kinds of transparency around extreme risks [including]&nbsp;<strong>Incident reporting</strong>, i.e. a structured process for developers to share concerning or otherwise noteworthy evaluation results with other developers, third parties, or regulators (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07213\"><u>Brundage et al., 2020</u></a>).

The appropriate national authorities and independent testing centres could build up shared institutional knowledge of common failure modes. The Commission would also be in a better position to adjust the scope and requirements of the framework. Such a database has been proposed by a broad coalition of researchers and the Partnership on AI has already launched such a database. Widespread use would be crucial for its success, but businesses might be wary of submitting incident reports for fear of reputational or other costs.</p><p>Several measures could be taken to address such concerns, e.g., by ensuring anonymity, security, and privacy. Submitting incident reports could be further incentivised, e.g., through regulatory requirements or monetary incentives for developers, users, or third parties (\"bounties\"). Similar models for such information-sharing arrangements have been set up in other areas. As part of European pharmacovigilance efforts, the European Medicines Agency, for instance, established a central electronic repository for periodic safety update reports by firms in the pharmaceutical industry. The Commission could apply best practices from similar such registries, where applicable.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.governance.ai/post/broad-expert-consensus-for-many-agi-safety-and-governance-best-practices\"><u>Towards best practices in AGI safety and governance</u></a> (GovAI, Schuett et al. 2023):</p><ul><li>\"<strong>Report safety incidents.</strong> AGI labs should report accidents and near misses to appropriate state actors and other AGI labs (e.g. via an AI incident database).\" 76% strongly agree; 20% somewhat agree; 2% strongly disagree; 2% don't know; n=51.</li><li>\"<strong>Industry sharing of security information.</strong> AGI labs should share threat intelligence and information about security incidents with each other.\" 53% strongly agree; 39% somewhat agree; 5% neither agree nor disagree; 3% don't know; n=38.</li><li>\"AGI labs should coordinate on best practices for incident reporting.\"</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/00963402.2023.2199580\"><u>How to deal with an AI near-miss: Look to the skies</u></a> (Shrishak 2023):</p><blockquote><p>an AI near-miss reporting system should have at least four properties to encourage AI actors to submit reports.</p><p>First, near-miss reporting should be voluntary. A near-miss reporting system helps capture issues that are not reported to a mandatory serious incidents reporting system. A near-miss reporter is thus contributing to a safer AI ecosystem. Such a contribution takes time and effort, and should not be made mandatory.</p><p>Second, near-miss reporting should be confidential. The near-miss report published in the public database should not contain any identifiable information so that there are no unnecessary negative repercussions for the reporter. This allows the reporter to answer why there was a failure, whether an unforeseen circumstance occurred, or whether a human made a mistake. All of these details are important to address problems without delay, but might go unreported if confidentiality is not guaranteed.</p><p>Third, there should be a clear immunity policy to guide near-miss reporters. The reporter should receive limited immunity from fines for their efforts to report near-misses. Regulators should be considerate of the reporter's contribution to the database in case a serious incident takes place. When a reporter submits a report, they should receive a proof of submission that they can use. Such a proof can be generated before all identifiable information is removed and the report is made confidential by the maintainers of the database. (This is also an important reason for the database to be maintained by a trusted third party, and not a regulator.)</p><p>Finally, the reporting system should have a low bureaucratic barrier. The format of the report should be simple and accessible so that it takes minimal time and effort for the reporter. Ease of reporting is essential for such a system to succeed.</p><p>Documenting and publishing near-misses would help AI system developers and regulators avoid serious incidents. Instead of waiting for major failures before problems are addressed, disasters could be prevented. What we need is an incident database where developers and users of AI system[s] voluntarily add incidents, including near-misses. To make such a database useful and to create an ecosystem where safer AI systems are prioritized, the database should have regulatory support. Privately run databases do not have the regulatory support that is required to give operators of AI systems the incentive to report their own near-misses.</p><p>If there is one thing that should not be replicated from other sectors, it is to wait decades before setting up and incentivizing AI near-miss reporting. It is never too soon to [set up] such a database. Now is the right time.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07773.pdf#page=3\"><u>Filling gaps in trustworthy development of AI</u></a> (Avin et al. 2021):</p><blockquote><p>Collecting and sharing evidence about . . . incidents can inform further R&amp;D efforts as well as regulatory mechanisms and user trust. . . . Incident sharing could become a regulatory requirement. Until then, voluntary sharing can be incentivized, for example by allowing anonymous disclosure to a trusted third party. Such a third party would need to have transparent processes for collecting and anonymizing information and operate an accessible and secure portal.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/ai-accidents-an-emerging-threat/\"><u>AI Accidents: An Emerging Threat</u></a> (CSET, Arnold and Toner 2021).</p><blockquote><p>[The US federal government should]&nbsp;<strong>Facilitate information sharing about AI accidents and near misses.</strong> To make AI safer, we need to know when and how it fails. In many other technological domains, shared incident reporting contributes to a common base of knowledge, helping industry and government track risks and understand their causes. Models include the National Transportation Safety Board\u2019s database for aviation incidents and the public-private cyber intelligence platforms known as Information Sharing and Analysis Centers. The government should consider creating a similar repository for AI accident reports. As part of this effort, policymakers should explore different ways of encouraging the private sector to actively disclose the details of AI accidents. For example, the government could offer confidentiality protections for sensitive commercial information in accident reports, develop common standards for incident reporting, or even mandate disclosure of certain types of incidents.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1145/3514094.3534181\"><u>Outsider Oversight: Designing a Third Party Audit Ecosystem for AI Governance</u></a> (Raji et al. 2022) (especially&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3514094.3534181#page=4\"><u>\u00a74.1 Target Identification &amp; Audit Scope</u></a>).</p><p><a href=\"https://openai.com/research/language-model-safety-and-misuse\"><u>Lessons learned on language model safety and misuse</u></a> (OpenAI, Brundage et al. 2022)</p><blockquote><p>To support the study of language model misuse and mitigation thereof, we are actively exploring opportunities to share statistics on safety incidents this year, in order to concretize discussions about language model misuse. . . .</p><p>Many aspects of language models' risks and impacts remain hard to measure and therefore hard to monitor, minimize, and disclose in an accountable way.

We need AI harm incident reporting and tracking in order to ensure that those who are harmed by AI systems are able to share their experiences and concerns. Standardization of AI harm incident tracking supports a grounded understanding of problems, system improvements by vendors and operators, better oversight by regulators, legal action where necessary, and greater visibility of incidents in the press and in the public eye. Incident tracking is a well-developed practice in some sectors, such as information security (<a href=\"https://www.ajl.org/bugs\"><u>Kenway and Fran\u00e7ois [et al.], 2021</u></a>). A robust incident response includes several key activities, including:</p><ul><li>Discovery\u2014in other words, learning that an incident has occurred</li><li>Reporting and tracking\u2014documenting and sharing information about the incident</li><li>Verification\u2014confirming that the incident is reproducible, or indeed caused by the system in question</li><li>Escalation\u2014flagging the incident in terms of severity and urgency</li><li>Mitigation\u2014changing the system so that the problem does not continue to cause harm, ideally through a root cause analysis rather than a superficial patch</li><li>Redress\u2014taking steps to ensure that anyone harmed by the problem feels that the harm they suffered has been recognized, addressed, and in some cases, compensated, and</li><li>Disclosure\u2014communicating about the problem to relevant stakeholders, including other industry actors, regulators, and the public.</li></ul><p>If organized well, harm incident reporting guides those who have experienced harm from AI systems (or their advocates) to provide informative descriptions of their experience that can then be used to expose problematic systems, improve (or in some cases, shut down) those systems, and seek redress. Systematic collection of AI harm incident reports is a critical step towards gaining a better understanding of the risks associated with AI system deployment, and towards ensuring the minimization, mitigation and redress of harms. However, there are currently no existing policy proposals, requirements, norms, standards or functional systems for AI harm incident tracking.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4491421\"><u>Building a Culture of Safety for AI</u></a> (Manheim 2023):</p><blockquote><p>For both approaches, one critical step needed to allow this is understanding the failure modes, which in other domains starts with reporting past incidents.

Realizing in the late 1980s that fining companies like Continental Airlines for reporting violations they had uncovered in their self-audit program would create incentives to underreport incidents, accidents and violations (<a href=\"https://www.businessofgovernment.org/sites/default/files/The%20Promise%20of%20Collaborative%20Voluntary%20Partnerships.pdf\"><u>Source</u></a>), the FAA initiated programs that would allow the reporting of incidents to go unpunished. A contributing factor was the increased demand in aviation and the increased calls for safety standards, which created the need for the collection of massive amounts of data. Encouraging self-regulation and self-reporting represented a way of lowering the administrative burden and the cost for regulatory agencies. These programs were intended to solve (or at least mitigate) the problems resulting from the so-called \"regulatory dilemma\" (see Table X).&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qkK5ejystp8GCJ3vC/j1l2mnyqdfqsyyxqu7eg\"></p><p><i>Table X: The Regulatory Dilemma</i> (<a href=\"https://www.businessofgovernment.org/sites/default/files/Management_Mills.pdf\"><u>Source</u></a>)</p><p>VRPPs and VSRPs are driven by the desire to establish cooperative and trust-based relationships between industry and regulators while simultaneously ensuring compliance and lowering the cost of enforcement (<a href=\"https://www.tc.faa.gov/its/worldpac/techrpt/ar0839.pdf\"><u>Source</u></a>). Reducing the need for external audits and investigations, they shift the responsibility to those who are subject to regulation. Crucially, they serve to transform the incentive structures that businesses are facing when it's been determined that a standard has been violated, offering reduced regulatory burden (which is associated with reduced administrative cost) and increased flexibility to companies that agree to be part of these programs (<a href=\"https://www.businessofgovernment.org/sites/default/files/The%20Promise%20of%20Collaborative%20Voluntary%20Partnerships.pdf\"><u>Source</u></a>). In some cases, the reward for self-reporting can even be the guarantee that the violator will not be fined or prosecuted. Examples within the FAA include:</p><ul><li>Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS)<ul><li>Submitting an incident report gives airspace users confidentiality and freedom from penalty in return&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Voluntary Disclosure Reporting Program (VDRP)<ul><li>Voluntary reports of systemic problems guarantee air carriers reduced regulatory enforcement action&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP) (also see<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-AWDU0AcIZC21S_P-KEJhcL6VRrg7KufKZlD5YcOlIU/edit?pli=1#heading=h.3333wlfrbdp2\">&nbsp;<u>chapter above</u></a>)<ul><li>Employees report safety-related events, FAA or carrier can't take punitive action against the employee&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><p>A comparison of these three programs can be found in Table Y.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qkK5ejystp8GCJ3vC/rlxlq8g8ohvdjtqjtypj\"></p><p><i>Table Y: Comparison of different programs within the FAA&nbsp;</i>(<a href=\"https://www.businessofgovernment.org/sites/default/files/The%20Promise%20of%20Collaborative%20Voluntary%20Partnerships.pdf\"><u>Source</u></a>)</p><p>The relative success of these programs in providing incentives for companies not to hide incidents and safety breaches notwithstanding, these voluntary reporting programs have also been criticized: \"Some argue that VRPPs represent industry's capture of regulatory agencies, while others claim that these programs represent a third way of ensuring industry compliance with regulation.\" (<a href=\"https://www.businessofgovernment.org/sites/default/files/Management_Mills.pdf\"><u>Source</u></a>) There is some evidence that these programs have failed to achieve what they were intending to accomplish, as a report by the IBM Centre for the Business of Government notes (<a href=\"https://www.businessofgovernment.org/sites/default/files/The%20Promise%20of%20Collaborative%20Voluntary%20Partnerships.pdf\"><u>Source</u></a>). A conclusion that is sometimes drawn from these observations is that CRPPs and VSRPs can complement but not replace traditional means of enforcement and regulation (<a href=\"https://www.businessofgovernment.org/sites/default/files/Management_Mills.pdf\"><u>Source</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Some parts of this post are drawn from \u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n's&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dikcpP32Q3cg6tvdA/ai-incident-sharing-best-practices-from-other-fields-and-a\"><u>AI Incident Sharing</u></a>.

Hopefully, this is a sign they can eventually coordinate.</p><h2>China\u2019s new generative AI rules</h2><p><strong>On Thursday, China\u2019s government released new rules governing generative AI.</strong> China\u2019s new<a href=\"https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/generative-ai-interim/\"><u> rules</u></a>, which are set to take effect on August 15th, regulate publicly-available generative AI services. The providers of such services will be criminally liable for the content their services generate.&nbsp;</p><p>The rules specify illegal content as:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cinciting subversion of national sovereignty or the overturn of the socialist system, endangering national security and interests or harming the nation\u2019s image, inciting separatism or undermining national unity and social stability, advocating terrorism or extremism, promoting ethnic hatred and ethnic discrimination, violence and obscenity, as well as fake and harmful information [...]\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Providers are also expected to respect intellectual property rights, protect personal information, and avoid using discriminatory training data.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6aa2b93-ca3a-4cd7-b363-38297a895733_1600x276.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6aa2b93-ca3a-4cd7-b363-38297a895733_1600x276.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6aa2b93-ca3a-4cd7-b363-38297a895733_1600x276.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6aa2b93-ca3a-4cd7-b363-38297a895733_1600x276.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6aa2b93-ca3a-4cd7-b363-38297a895733_1600x276.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff6aa2b93-ca3a-4cd7-b363-38297a895733_1600x276.png 1456w\"></a></p><p><strong>The rules are some of the strictest regulations of generative AI to date. </strong>In order to publicly release generative AI services, Chinese companies will need to be able to tightly control what their models generate. <a href=\"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/china-announces-rules-to-keep-ai-bound-by-core-socialist-values/ar-AA1dQIiA\"><u>According to</u></a> Helen Toner, the Director of Georgetown\u2019s Center for Security and Emerging Technology (CSET), the rules represent \u201ca pretty significant set of responsibilities, and will make it hard for smaller companies without an existing compliance and censorship apparatus to offer services.\u201d</p><p>However, even large companies will face regulatory challenges. Baidu is <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/chinas-baidu-confident-its-ai-chatbot-wont-make-mistakes-sensitive-topics-2023-05-16/\"><u>still waiting on government approval</u></a> to release its chatbot, Ernie. Baidu isn\u2019t alone \u2014 currently no LLM is publicly available in China.</p><p><strong>China is balancing regulation with promoting technological innovation</strong>. Critically, the rules only apply to publicly-available generative AI. They do not regulate research done by AI labs. This distinction represents a change from an <a href=\"https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/comparison-chart-of-current-vs-draft-rules-for-generative-ai/\"><u>earlier draft</u></a> of the rules, which also regulated the \u201cresearch and development\u201d of generative AI. The earlier draft would have also required companies to verify the accuracy of data they used to train their models, which, given the huge amount of data used to train LLMs, would have been an impossible task.</p><p>In the face of a <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/china-economic-data-likely-show-recovery-is-fading-quickly-2023-07-16/\"><u>stalling recovery</u></a> after the pandemic, China might have to rely on technological innovation to drive economic growth. China aims to become <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/id-b43da0d919ee46efb0e185668a2be263\"><u>a world leader in AI by 2030.</u></a> At the same time as regulators fear the dangers of AI, they want to keep Chinese AI development competitive with the US. The final draft of the rules on generative AI represents China\u2019s attempt at balancing those interests.</p><h2>The FTC investigates OpenAI</h2><p><strong>The FTC is investigating OpenAI over possible breaches of consumer protection law.</strong> On Thursday \u2014 the same day as China released its new rules \u2014 the Washington Post <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/07/13/ftc-openai-chatgpt-sam-altman-lina-khan/\"><u>reported</u></a> that the FTC had opened an investigation into OpenAI. The FTC is investigating whether OpenAI has engaged in unfair or deceptive practices that have caused \"reputational harm\" to consumers. It is also investigating a March security incident disclosed by OpenAI, where a system bug allowed some users to access payment-related information and other users' chat history.</p><p>The FTC sent a <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/documents/67a7081c-c770-4f05-a39e-9d02117e50e8.pdf?itid=lk_inline_manual_4\"><u>civil investigative demand</u></a> to OpenAI, which requested documents pertaining to possible breaches of consumer protection law. If the FTC finds that OpenAI did breach consumer protection laws, it can compel OpenAI to reach an agreement known as a <a href=\"https://cdt.org/insights/how-to-strengthen-the-ftc-privacy-security-consent-decrees/\"><u>consent decree</u></a>, in which OpenAI would change its practices with FTC oversight. If OpenAI does not comply with the agreement, the FTC could <a href=\"https://www.ftc.gov/business-guidance/blog/2022/05/twitter-pay-150-million-penalty-allegedly-breaking-its-privacy-promises-again\"><u>levy fines</u></a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F837c8836-fb82-44b9-8091-3ac305f4f556_1110x670.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F837c8836-fb82-44b9-8091-3ac305f4f556_1110x670.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F837c8836-fb82-44b9-8091-3ac305f4f556_1110x670.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F837c8836-fb82-44b9-8091-3ac305f4f556_1110x670.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F837c8836-fb82-44b9-8091-3ac305f4f556_1110x670.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F837c8836-fb82-44b9-8091-3ac305f4f556_1110x670.png 1456w\"></a></p><p><strong>The FTC\u2019s investigation represents the most serious challenge to generative AI services in the US to date.</strong> The US has lagged behind the rest of the world (notably the <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/artificial-intelligence-chatgpt-europe-rules-906fc89d2561b200fa6eb40a06b946a5\"><u>EU</u></a>, and now China) in developing AI regulations. In the meantime, federal agencies have had to rely on existing legislation to regulate AI.

It has warned that there is no \"AI exemption\" to consumer protection laws.&nbsp;</p><p>The US and China are independently concerned with AI safety, and are both moving quickly to regulate private actors. Hopefully, they can eventually coordinate to avoid an AI arms race.</p><h1>Results from a tournament forecasting AI risk</h1><p>A new report presents the views of both AI experts and \u2018superforecasters\u2019 on AI risk. In this story, we summarize the key results and discuss their implications.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The report pits AI experts against \u2018superforecasters\u2019.</strong> The Forecasting Research Institute (FRI) has <a href=\"https://forecastingresearch.org/news/results-from-the-2022-existential-risk-persuasion-tournament\"><u>released results</u></a> from its 2022 Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament. In this tournament, both subject domain experts and \u2018superforecasters\u2019 predicted and debated the likelihoods of various catastrophic and existential risks.&nbsp;</p><p>\u2018Superforecasting\u2019 is a term coined by Philip Tetlock, who is one of the authors of FRI\u2019s report. Tetlock\u2019s prior research has found that certain individuals, dubbed 'superforecasters,' consistently outperform experts in forecasting many near-term geopolitical events.</p><p><strong>Superforecasters and AI experts disagreed about AI risk.</strong> One key result from the report is that superforecasters predicted lower probabilities of catastrophic or existential events than domain experts, and particularly from AI. The median superforecaster gave a 2.31% risk of catastrophe and 0.38% risk of extinction due to AI by 2100. In contrast, the median AI domain expert gave a 12% risk of catastrophe and 3.9% risk of extinction.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38d5a6b0-404d-4a22-86af-353f98a8fb27_1600x327.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38d5a6b0-404d-4a22-86af-353f98a8fb27_1600x327.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38d5a6b0-404d-4a22-86af-353f98a8fb27_1600x327.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38d5a6b0-404d-4a22-86af-353f98a8fb27_1600x327.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38d5a6b0-404d-4a22-86af-353f98a8fb27_1600x327.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F38d5a6b0-404d-4a22-86af-353f98a8fb27_1600x327.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>In the tournament, neither superforecasters nor AI experts were able to persuade each other to change their probabilities. However, it might be argued that we should give more weight to the views of superforecasters. After all, they have made more accurate predictions than experts in Tetlock\u2019s previous research.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AI risk might not be \u201csuperforecastable.\u201d</strong> Some of the methods that superforecasters use aren\u2019t applicable to AI risk. One such method is the \u201coutside view.\u201d Rather than rely on their internal assessments, superforecasters identify a reference class of similar past events. For example, an expert might predict the outcome of a basketball game based on their in-depth knowledge of the players and coaches. In contrast, a superforecaster might predict the outcome by looking at the results of games between teams with similar records.&nbsp;</p><p>The \u201coutside view\u201d approach is difficult or impossible to apply to AI risk because there is no clear reference class. Perhaps the outside view is to continue extrapolating economic trends. Another outside view is that we should zoom out and recognize we are in a biologically significant period; prior periods are the emergence of singular cellular life, then multicellular life, and now we are approaching the transition from biological to digital life. There is no backlog of AI catastrophes to learn from. In statistics, an AI catastrophe would be a \u201ctail event\u201d \u2014 a rare but incredibly impactful event. Nassim Nicholas Taleb has described many tail events as \u201cblack swans.\u201d Black swans are almost impossible to be completely certain about. Because of their importance, we must prepare for them nonetheless.</p><p>In sum, we do not find this report reassuring. Despite their disagreement about probabilities, AI experts and superforecasts agreed that <strong>AI presented the greatest threat of human extinction of any of the risks.</strong></p><hr><h1>Updates on xAI\u2019s plan</h1><p>On Friday, xAI held a Twitter Space in which gave details about its plan.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F508af7fa-cbbb-4eb8-bc5c-cac6998ffd94_800x374.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F508af7fa-cbbb-4eb8-bc5c-cac6998ffd94_800x374.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F508af7fa-cbbb-4eb8-bc5c-cac6998ffd94_800x374.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F508af7fa-cbbb-4eb8-bc5c-cac6998ffd94_800x374.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F508af7fa-cbbb-4eb8-bc5c-cac6998ffd94_800x374.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F508af7fa-cbbb-4eb8-bc5c-cac6998ffd94_800x374.png 1456w\"></a></p><p><strong>xAI\u2019s plan is to build \u201cmaximally-curious\u201d AGI.</strong> During the call, Musk argued that the safest way to build an AGI is to be maximally-curious, rather than to align it to human values directly.

I'm going to let this article speak for itself but will add a bit of <i>EA style argument</i>. It will probably make sense if you skip the next paragraph and read the article first.</p><p>&nbsp;I tend to think protest is probably undervalued by EA. The effectiveness of this sort of protest that just happened is inherently pretty difficult to measure. But it seems reasonable to think that a better deal was reached because of internet activism on bedaquiline that may have saved, let's say conservatively, a hundred thousand lives. The input for that included time and attention from a lot of people who might have otherwise spent that time doing other stuff, most of it probably not anywhere near as impactful. Suppose roughly a fifth of the 500k views of John Green's original video were serious activists that spent 4 hours of their time learning or otherwise investing time in activism. Suppose they make on average $20/hr. Then the <i>opportunity cost</i> to the activism was around 8 million. I kind of have huge problems with this whole line of argument, but that means the cost for activists to save one life was around $80. That is kind of ridiculous.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>We\u2019re dancing on the ruins of multinational corporations<br>Dancing on the ruins of multinational corporation<br>Dancing on the ruins of multinational corporation<br>Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>When John came to you in the way of righteousness, you did not believe him; but tax collectors and prostitutes did.

(Mt 21:32)</p></blockquote><h3>Synodality and Protest</h3><p>The Catholic Church has been engaged for a few years in <i>synodality.</i> In simple terms, synodality is action of the Church <i>journeying together</i>. Stripped of all the theological bells and whistles it\u2019s just trying to include the little people in Church decision making<a href=\"https://nathanaelroy.substack.com/p/a-major-step-in-the-fight-against#footnote-1-135129153\"><sup><u>1</u></sup></a>. Synodality is a way of being church together. There has been a bunch written on what synodality means, and because people are messy, and the Catholic Church has at times been much more sympathetic to <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40603816-the-pope-and-mussolini\"><u>authoritarian regimes over democratic ones</u></a>, synodality has been hard for some<a href=\"https://nathanaelroy.substack.com/p/a-major-step-in-the-fight-against#footnote-2-135129153\"><sup><u>2</u></sup></a>to grapple with as a good thing. Some of what has been written has been <a href=\"https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/2022/02/17/synodality-history-john-omalley-242081\"><u>good</u></a> while some has been <a href=\"https://www.catholicnewsagency.com/news/39731/what-is-synodality-experts-explain\"><u>very stupid</u></a>. In my view, synodality is hard to implement as a concept, useful in implementation, and ultimately powerful in working change on the world. One place I see implementing <i>synodality </i>is that of protest and direct action.</p><p>I am not at home at a protest, strike, or on a picket line. I get tired and overwhelmed. My body enters a flooded state of emotions that I manage with multiple time-outs in the shade. This usually isn\u2019t a problem. Part of the point of direct action is to create tension. In the words of Martin Luther King Jr.</p><blockquote><p>Nonviolent direct action seeks to create such a crisis and foster such a tension that a community which has constantly refused to negotiate is forced to confront the issue. It seeks so to dramatize the issue that it can no longer be ignored.</p></blockquote><p>More bodies on the line helps foster the necessary tension. If you are ever a part of a protest, know that the very point is to submit your very <i>being</i> toward fostering a positive tension if your cause is just. The protest needs bodies, you are there to be a body. I have always been much better at being a body on the internet. Virtual direct action can be much stranger. There are so many disperse areas you could be an online body such as call centers, government representatives, Facebook, Twitter, email addresses of executives, LinkedIn, op-ed pages, etc. that it can feel hard to imagine being one body makes a difference. But let me tell you as someone who has worked in marketing before, brand managers feel that tension when a bunch of organized people start yelling at them in a bunch of places on the internet.</p><h3>Tuberculosis, a short history</h3><p>July 18, 2023, marks a major step in the fight against Tuberculosis (TB), history\u2019s deadliest disease. Johnson &amp; Johnson agreed to a deal that allows the<a href=\"https://www.stoptb.org/news/global-drug-facility-update-access-to-bedaquiline\"><u> sale of generics in most low- and middle-income countries</u></a>, in a win for humanity. This decision will likely significantly cut costs for the most in need, leading to access to treatment for potentially over one million people in the next four years that would otherwise not have access. Over the course of history, over one billion people have died due to TB. Despite incredible advances that make it virtually harmless in places like the US, TB remains the deadliest infectious disease in the world<a href=\"https://nathanaelroy.substack.com/p/a-major-step-in-the-fight-against#footnote-3-135129153\"><sup><u>3</u></sup></a>.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8f71755-5ed0-4b9c-9759-a8c9e88e1ec0_1200x742.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8f71755-5ed0-4b9c-9759-a8c9e88e1ec0_1200x742.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8f71755-5ed0-4b9c-9759-a8c9e88e1ec0_1200x742.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8f71755-5ed0-4b9c-9759-a8c9e88e1ec0_1200x742.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8f71755-5ed0-4b9c-9759-a8c9e88e1ec0_1200x742.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe8f71755-5ed0-4b9c-9759-a8c9e88e1ec0_1200x742.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>-<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/tb/statistics/surv/surv2021/default.htm\"><u>CDC</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.who.int/teams/global-tuberculosis-programme/tb-reports/global-tuberculosis-report-2021/disease-burden/mortality\"><u>WHO</u></a>.</p><p>Around 600 deaths in the US (2020)</p><p>1.2 million deaths in high TB burden countries</p><p>That\u2019s with <i><strong>most people surviving TB even in high burden countries.</strong></i></p><hr><p>The story of TB and other bacterial infections is the same. In the early- and mid-twentieth century, humanity turned the tide in the battle of infectious disease using new treatments including antibiotics and vaccines. While progress was global, access to every tool in the battle has not been consistent nor universal. Poorer countries lack access to medical and drug development infrastructure and robust social funding of healthcare. So, in the late twentieth century when drug resistance to antibiotics began to appear, the progress in poorer countries would prove more fragile to multidrug resistant TB (MDR-TB). For many years there had been little or no progress on the tools used to fight TB. Then Janssen Biotech (a Johnson and Johnson company) developed bedaquiline and in 2012 bedaquiline was approved through the FDA specifically to treat MDR-TB.</p><h3>An End To Patent - 1.3 million benefit</h3><p>Bedaquiline's original patent expires Tuesday, July 18.&nbsp;With that end to the patent the price of the drug regimens for MDR-TB should be cut by 60% as generics will be able to enter the market. But because of a secondary patent J&amp;J and global development companies have been in discussion for months.&nbsp; Global development organizations such as MSF, PIH, and Stop TB Partnerships urged J&amp;J to not enforce the patent beyond July, arguing that most of the funding to develop bedaquiline came from government sources. Many lives are at stake in these discussions, with estimates that around three out of four patients impacted by MDR-TB, over 1.3 million people, would not be able to access bedaquiline over the next four years if the patent continued to be enforced.</p><p>J&amp;J isn\u2019t the evil corporation in this story, after all they are an institution that <i>created a drug that has done tremendous good</i>. However, putting patents before patients would have done tremendous harm. Enter into this story John Green and his fans, including me. On Tuesday, John Green, noted author and current acting CEO of Complexly, uploaded an open letter to J&amp;J, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMhgw5SW0h4\"><u>\u201dBarely Contained Rage: An Open letter to Johnson and Johnson\u201d</u></a> that indicted J&amp;J for not living up to their corporate credo. Additionally, John Green let them know as a CEO that it would be a bad business decision.</p><h3>A Promise: Nerdfighters Come to Stay</h3><p>This was not mere rhetoric; this was a promise. In popular imagination, internet activism is seen as reactive, flitting from thing to thing. Normally this means that brands can simply ride out an outrage generated by a celebrity or event. However, I have watched John Green, and his brother Hank Green for over ten years. Over the last year Tuberculosis has become a hobby horse for John Green, so many of the vlogbrothers cult<a href=\"https://nathanaelroy.substack.com/p/a-major-step-in-the-fight-against#footnote-4-135129153\"><sup><u>4</u></sup></a><sup><u> </u></sup>like following, we sometimes call ourselves nerdfighters, already were aware of the issues of TB. <a href=\"https://news.thepublishpress.com/p/john-green\"><u>John Green knew</u></a> he would be able to sustain pressure on J&amp;J. He knew that the people most likely to watch and share this open letter would also come back week after week to hear him continue to be angry with J&amp;J for the next year if things didn\u2019t change. Although I also don\u2019t think he realized how swift and effective the initial pressure on J&amp;J would be to allow generic manufacture of bedaquiline.&nbsp;</p><p>Within twenty-four hours of posting his open letter, over half a million people had viewed the video, calls had flooded J&amp;J\u2019s ethics complaint line, #PatientsNotPatents was trending on twitter, and every recent social media post from J&amp;J across Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and Instagram had huge numbers of comments asking J&amp;J to not enforce their patent. J&amp;J released a hilariously bad PR statement on twitter, disabling comments, that tried to do damage control.</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JNJNews/status/1679168314986094592\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32ab5a5b-bd7d-4721-a402-8a96497947c6_385x896.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32ab5a5b-bd7d-4721-a402-8a96497947c6_385x896.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32ab5a5b-bd7d-4721-a402-8a96497947c6_385x896.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32ab5a5b-bd7d-4721-a402-8a96497947c6_385x896.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F32ab5a5b-bd7d-4721-a402-8a96497947c6_385x896.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>Within two days of Green\u2019s video, StopTB Partnerships announced a deal had been reached that allowed sale of generic bedaquiline in the majority of low- and middle-income countries.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.stoptb.org/news/global-drug-facility-update-access-to-bedaquiline\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe20bdc2-536e-4c7c-be78-d78b12cdccf0_1527x411.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe20bdc2-536e-4c7c-be78-d78b12cdccf0_1527x411.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe20bdc2-536e-4c7c-be78-d78b12cdccf0_1527x411.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe20bdc2-536e-4c7c-be78-d78b12cdccf0_1527x411.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fbe20bdc2-536e-4c7c-be78-d78b12cdccf0_1527x411.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>John Green gave credit not to the coordinated protest, but primarily to the negotiation by StopTB Partnerships</p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/johngreen/status/1679460591193268225\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F111fa384-81ed-487c-848a-77a2377e3912_748x350.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F111fa384-81ed-487c-848a-77a2377e3912_748x350.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F111fa384-81ed-487c-848a-77a2377e3912_748x350.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F111fa384-81ed-487c-848a-77a2377e3912_748x350.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F111fa384-81ed-487c-848a-77a2377e3912_748x350.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>And here\u2019s the thing, a lot of the protest online was joyful, even fun.

Gap</u></i></a><i>?</i> John\u2019s brother, Hank Green discussed one of the major flaws of the internet\u2019s ability to make you aware of many problems but not of solutions. \u201cIt\u2019s easier to make people aware of the definite, obvious, clear problem than it is of the misty, vague, and uncertain solutions.\u201d John Green\u2019s follow up video included the idea that \u201cyou can\u2019t go deep on everything, but the deeper you go on one topic, the more valuable you become,\u201d and being inspired by Partners in Health to stay in Sierra Leone in philanthropy and listen to what the people who needed help needed for sustainably building back after disaster was more valuable than moving from crisis to crisis. John Green has been significantly influenced by Paul Farmer and therefore indirectly on the very explicitly Catholic approach to tackling societal level problems.</p><p>John Green went deep on Tuberculosis with a large number of people, and now it paid off in a pretty spectacular way that may have saved hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of lives. He rightly gives credit to the hundreds of people behind the scenes who have worked to develop, manufacture, deploy, and fight for treatment to bedaquiline along with him. I now have a word for going deep, having priorities, and journeying together as a Catholic as well, that word is synodality - not in service to others for <i>my</i> sake but for <i>our</i> sake. I celebrate this milestone in the fight against history\u2019s deadliest disease. It is not a full win, nor the only problem that remains, but it is a victory - for J&amp;J, for patients, for <i>us </i>journeying together.</p><h3>So Why Do I Feel So Empty?</h3><p>I am still angry with J&amp;J for not ending their patent, for the incomplete win, for the many who will likely die after this imperfect deal. It seems likely to me that John Green has the right policy approach of calling them to account, then celebrating when they do the right thing. After all, J&amp;J could have developed many other drugs that are much less impactful toward ending human suffering and death, including cancer treatment which is also a very good thing to treat and could have made them more money with less global responsibility! J&amp;J also is ultimately a collection of people making decisions.</p><p>Partners in Health went with the more cautiously optimistic approach, recognizing that J&amp;J didn\u2019t actually relinquish any power in this issue, it will still hold onto patents in most of these countries over the next four years.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8d2bdaf-cdeb-4d12-9889-11d9fb0f6e06_761x375.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8d2bdaf-cdeb-4d12-9889-11d9fb0f6e06_761x375.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8d2bdaf-cdeb-4d12-9889-11d9fb0f6e06_761x375.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8d2bdaf-cdeb-4d12-9889-11d9fb0f6e06_761x375.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8d2bdaf-cdeb-4d12-9889-11d9fb0f6e06_761x375.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fb8d2bdaf-cdeb-4d12-9889-11d9fb0f6e06_761x375.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But more than anything, I feel personally angry about this issue <i>as a Catholic. </i>Other than PIH, which is a Catholic institution only in the loosest sense that one of its main founders (Paul Farmer) was really into <a href=\"https://www.americamagazine.org/politics-society/2022/02/25/paul-farmer-remembrance-242465\"><u>Catholic social teaching</u></a>,<a href=\"https://nathanaelroy.substack.com/p/a-major-step-in-the-fight-against#footnote-5-135129153\"><sup><u>5</u></sup></a><sup><u> </u></sup>no major publication<a href=\"https://nathanaelroy.substack.com/p/a-major-step-in-the-fight-against#footnote-6-135129153\"><sup><u>6</u></sup></a><sup><u> </u></sup>of the Catholic Church or major Bishop spoke out on this as far as I know.

Having priorities is good. But look, I spent a long time being a body on the internet for those couple of days. I reached out to Catholic media and Catholic clergy. I looked for some sign that maybe someone with power or influence in the Catholic Church cared about, and I cannot stress this enough (so I\u2019ll make it a big title)</p><h1>THE DEADLIEST DISEASE IN THE WHOLE OF FREAKING HUMANKIND</h1><p>and what I saw was, \u201cOh, didn\u2019t know about that, maybe catch us next time?\u201d I think I heard my computer laugh at me when I put \u201cTuberculosis statement by Catholic\u201d in the search bar<a href=\"https://nathanaelroy.substack.com/p/a-major-step-in-the-fight-against#footnote-7-135129153\"><sup><u>7</u></sup></a>.

It\u2019s not like this is the first time I worked on something that the institutional church looked at and collectively went <i>shrug</i>. I volunteered for the Covid Tracking Project<a href=\"https://nathanaelroy.substack.com/p/a-major-step-in-the-fight-against#footnote-8-135129153\"><sup><u>8</u></sup></a><sup><u> </u></sup>with the Race Data Tracking Project for a year. I know for a fact many in that organization were from different faiths, but the Holy Spirit was absolutely on fire in the work I did there. Then, of course, I would log off after a few hours of writing down numbers of people in each state who had newly tested positive or died of Covid. And log on to social media to see some bishops loudly and publicly not get vaccinated for various reasons, all of them very dumb. I was reminded of this fact when looking to see if someone, anyone had made a statement on bedaquiline.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F271221d0-85e7-4adf-8818-feb62e3cdcae_1517x366.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F271221d0-85e7-4adf-8818-feb62e3cdcae_1517x366.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F271221d0-85e7-4adf-8818-feb62e3cdcae_1517x366.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F271221d0-85e7-4adf-8818-feb62e3cdcae_1517x366.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F271221d0-85e7-4adf-8818-feb62e3cdcae_1517x366.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F271221d0-85e7-4adf-8818-feb62e3cdcae_1517x366.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>This is National Catholic Reporter which, to their credit, pointed out that the bishops were being very dumb.</p><p>I can\u2019t decide whether to end this on hope or wrath, so I\u2019ll circle back to synodality and try to do both.

that </strong><i><strong>catastrophic</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;risk&nbsp;from nuclear weapons by 2100 is almost twice as likely as </strong><i><strong>catastrophic</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;risk from AI by 2100 </strong>(4% vs 2.13%).</li><li><strong>XPT superforecasters predicted that </strong><i><strong>extinction</strong></i><strong>&nbsp;risk from AI by 2050 and 2100 is roughly an order of magnitude larger than extinction</strong><i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i><strong>risk from nuclear, which in turn is an order of magnitude larger than non-anthropogenic

details).&nbsp;</li><li><strong>XPT domain experts predicted that AI extinction risk by 2100 is far greater than XPT superforecasters do </strong>(3% for domain experts, and 0.38% for superforecasters by 2100).</li><li><strong>Although XPT superforecasters and experts disagreed substantially about AI risk, both superforecasters and experts still prioritized AI as an area for marginal resource

If you were to allocate $50 billion to the following risk avoidance areas, what fraction of the money would you allocate to each area?</li></ul><p>Across superforecasters and experts and across all three resource allocation questions, AI received the single largest allocation, with one exception (superforecasters in the postmortem survey on the $50bn question):</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/K2xQrrXn5ZSgtntuT/g8yyozrvbazroq5emev3\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/K2xQrrXn5ZSgtntuT/mzmhjqgucrpcmsxlosny 119w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/K2xQrrXn5ZSgtntuT/tennhmx07qskecoiteh6 199w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/K2xQrrXn5ZSgtntuT/xikuyf4kvyy4b1gsadpq 279w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/K2xQrrXn5ZSgtntuT/jqfurxw8pnqwz9cyqo3u 359w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/K2xQrrXn5ZSgtntuT/qbhycp5ecu8hfj5dsijl 439w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/K2xQrrXn5ZSgtntuT/idf5i3pnblw1gwtnckj5 519w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/K2xQrrXn5ZSgtntuT/wqosf4o8h1ahgh9oylvj 599w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/K2xQrrXn5ZSgtntuT/aueqm7nnovjklbtf7df2 679w\"></figure><p>The only instance where AI did not receive the largest single allocation is superforecasters\u2019 postmortem allocation on the $50bn question (where AI received the second highest allocation after nuclear). The $50bn question is also the only absolute resource allocation question (the other two are marginal), and the question where AI\u2019s allocation was smallest in percentage terms (across supers and experts and across both surveys).</p><p>A possible explanation here is that XPT forecasters see AI as underfunded on the margin \u2014 although superforecasters think that in absolute terms AI should still receive less funding than nuclear risk.</p><p>The main contribution of these results to what the XPT tells us about AI risk is that even though superforecasters and experts disagreed substantially about the probability of AI risk, and even though the absolute probabilities of superforecasters for AI risk were 1% or lower, both superforecasters and experts still prioritize AI as an area for marginal resource allocation.</p><h2>Forecasts from the top reciprocal scoring quintile</h2><p>In the XPT, forecasts for years later than 2030 were incentivized using a method called <a href=\"https://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.3954498\"><u>reciprocal scoring</u></a>. For each of the relevant questions, forecasters were asked to give their own forecasts, while also predicting the forecasts of other experts and superforecasters. Forecasters who most accurately predicted superforecaster and expert forecasts got a higher reciprocal score.</p><p>In the course of the XPT, there were systematic differences between the forecasts of those with high reciprocal scores and those with lower scores, in particular:</p><ul><li>Superforecasters outperformed experts at reciprocal scoring. They also tended to be more skeptical of high risks and fast progress.</li><li>Higher reciprocal scores within both groups \u2014 experts and superforecasters \u2014 correlated with lower estimates of catastrophic and extinction risk.</li></ul><p>In other words, the better forecasters were at discerning what other people would predict, the less concerned they were about extinction.</p><p>We won\u2019t know for many decades which forecasts were more accurate, and as reciprocal scoring is a new method, there is insufficient evidence to definitively establish its correlation with the accuracy of long-range forecasts. However, in the plausible case that reciprocal scoring accuracy does indeed correlate with overall accuracy, it would justify giving more weight to forecasts from individuals with high reciprocal scores&nbsp;\u2014 which are lower risk predictions in the XPT. Readers should exercise their own judgment in determining how to read these findings.</p><p>It is also important to note that, in the present case, superforecasters\u2019 higher scores were driven by their more accurate predictions of superforecasters\u2019 views (both groups were comparable at predicting experts\u2019 views). It is therefore conceivable that their superior performance is due to the fact that superforecasters are a relatively small social group and have spent lots of time discussing forecasts with one another, rather than due to general higher accuracy.</p><p>Here is a comparison of median forecasts on AI risk between top reciprocal scoring (RS) quintile forecasters and all forecasters, for superforecasters and domain experts:</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><strong>Question</strong></td><td style=\"border-color:hsl(0, 0%, 0%);border-style:solid;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><strong>Forecasters</strong></td><td style=\"border-color:hsl(0, 0%, 0%);border-style:solid\"><strong>2030</strong></td><td style=\"border-color:hsl(0, 0%, 0%);border-style:solid\"><strong>2050</strong></td><td style=\"border-color:hsl(0, 0%, 0%);border-style:solid\"><strong>2100</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid hsl(0, 0%, 0%);padding:5pt\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"4\"><a href=\"https://forecastingresearch.org/s/XPT.pdf#page=133\"><strong><u>AI Catastrophic risk</u></strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong><br><strong>(&gt;10% of humans die within 5 years)</strong></td><td style=\"border-color:hsl(0, 0%, 0%);border-style:solid;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"1\" rowspan=\"1\"><strong>RS top quintile -

De modo geral, as pessoas envolvidas no movimento altru\u00edsta tendem a concordar que dever\u00edamos distribuir recursos entre causas diversas.

Expor nossas perspectivas livre e civilizadamente \u00e9 algo esperado e desejado; por\u00e9m, acreditamos que \u00e0s vezes \u00e9 necess\u00e1rio ponderar sobre algumas quest\u00f5es como as listadas abaixo:</p><ul><li>\u201cComo posso saber se minha ideia est\u00e1 alinhada com a realidade dos fatos?\u201d</li><li>\u201cQue evid\u00eancias seriam necess\u00e1rias para me convencer de que eu estou enganado acerca da efic\u00e1cia desta ideia?\u201d</li><li>\u201cSe eu n\u00e3o estou enganado acerca desta ideia, que coisas eu deveria estar fazendo diferente em minha vida? E em que outros aspectos eu posso estar enganado, segundo esta mesma perspectiva?\u201d</li><li>\u201cComo isso pode afetar meus planos de vida/carreira?\u201d</li></ul><p>Ainda, sob uma perspectiva mais ampla:</p><ul><li>\u201cQuais s\u00e3o os meus poss\u00edveis pontos-cegos?\u201d</li><li>\u201cSobre que outras quest\u00f5es importantes eu deveria estar ponderando?\u201d</li><li>\u201cO qu\u00e3o certo eu estou de que esta ideia/plano de a\u00e7\u00e3o ir\u00e1 de fato ajudar a melhorar as coisas?\u201d</li></ul><p>Responder a essas quest\u00f5es com o devido escrut\u00ednio nos leva a refinar e a atualizar nossos pontos de vista e, em \u00faltima inst\u00e2ncia, a tomar decis\u00f5es mais acertadas sobre as coisas com as quais nos importamos.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Diverg\u00eancias podem ser \u00fateis</strong></h3><p>Quando pessoas habituadas a pensar e a questionar chegam a conclus\u00f5es bastante distintas entre si, apesar de terem tido acesso a mesma informa\u00e7\u00e3o, dever\u00edamos nos interessar sobre os motivos subjacentes a isso. Dever\u00edamos, al\u00e9m disso, encorajar abertamente o livre debate acerca de tais ideias e investigar as causas que levaram \u00e0 tais disson\u00e2ncias.&nbsp;</p><p>Se, por exemplo, uma comunidade m\u00e9dica est\u00e1 em d\u00favida sobre o melhor medicamento, entre as op\u00e7\u00f5es A e B, para tratar ou curar determinada doen\u00e7a; deveriam querer chegar no \u00e2mago da discord\u00e2ncia, porque a resposta correta importa \u2013 afinal, vidas est\u00e3o em jogo.&nbsp;</p><p>Por exemplo, iniciar um di\u00e1logo discordando de outro membro e eventualmente mudar de opini\u00e3o, pode ser algo&nbsp; dif\u00edcil de admitir, mas achamos que \u00e9 algo a ser celebrado. Ajudar debates a se tornarem mais claros mudando de opini\u00e3o diante de argumentos plaus\u00edveis vai ajudar a comunidade a agir para salvar vidas da maneira mais eficaz poss\u00edvel.</p><p>Ainda que voc\u00ea discorde de outros pontos de vista, voc\u00ea vai aprender mais se reconhecer tal discord\u00e2ncia e buscar compreender exatamente como e porqu\u00ea tais perspectivas se diferem das suas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Tenha consci\u00eancia do nosso privil\u00e9gio e da seriedade dos problemas abordados</strong></h3><p>N\u00e3o \u00e9 prudente de nossa parte nos esquecermos de nosso privil\u00e9gio de sermos capazes de ler e discutir essas ideias, e que estamos falando de vidas reais . Somos afortunados por estarmos numa posi\u00e7\u00e3o na qual podemos ter um impacto t\u00e3o grande, e tal oportunidade \u00e9 uma consequ\u00eancia da profunda disparidade social e econ\u00f4mica existente.</p><p>Ademais, conv\u00e9m ter em mente que as pessoas interessadas neste programa adv\u00eam de contextos distintos e apresentam opini\u00f5es e conhecimentos diversos.</p><p>Alguns t\u00f3picos podem ser desafiadores para alguns, e at\u00e9 mesmo desconfort\u00e1veis para outros \u2013, sendo por isso facilmente negligenciados, e por isso t\u00e3o importantes \u2013, especialmente quando trata-se de um assunto particularmente delicado num n\u00edvel pessoal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Explore al\u00e9m</strong></h3><p>Este manual visa introduzir pessoas interessadas no Altru\u00edsmo Eficaz de uma maneira did\u00e1tica e bem estruturada.

For example, our 2018 PriorityWiki project would have involved a large volunteer coordination effort we weren\u2019t well-placed to execute, and it is unclear how valuable it would have been even if successful.&nbsp;</li><li>Our biggest early mistake was not building a plan for each project\u2019s path to influence and not putting enough resources into measuring our impact.

Further funding would help the team in developing a live tracker of the cost-effectiveness of farmed animal interventions, producing data sets on farmed animals, developing a strategy for legal protection of aquatic animals in the EU, promoting farmed insect welfare, and more.</li><li><u>AI Governance and Strategy</u>: The team aims to bridge technical and policy worlds as well as to serve as a talent pipeline and improve coordination among relevant actors. They will focus on four areas: compute governance, the intersection of China and AI governance, lab governance, and U.S. regulations. With funding, the team could hire additional staff to tackle questions about the impacts of and ideal changes to the 2022 semiconductor export controls, what plausible U.S. regulations on frontier AI systems would be beneficial and counterproductive, and what holes prominent governance proposals leave open and how those can be patched.&nbsp;</li><li><u>Existential Security</u>: The team will focus on helping launch entrepreneurial projects that aim to reduce existential risk, by identifying and developing the most promising project ideas, and then finding and supporting founders to make those projects happen. The team currently has significant unused management capacity with funding as the key bottleneck for them making new hires.&nbsp;</li><li><u>Global Health and Development</u>: With funding, the team would increase the impact of their current work by investing more time on disseminating their results. They would also build their own emerging research agenda (alongside ongoing commissioned work). With increased capacity, the team would also aim to engage mainstream funders and stakeholders.</li><li><u>Survey and Data Analysis</u>: The team aims to conduct systematic research exploring critical strategic questions. One such area of focus centers on the impact of message framings of existential long-term risks among distinct groups. The team also aims to examine public opinion by assessing the levels of support or opposition for specific policies.&nbsp;</li><li><u>Worldview Investigations</u>: The team plans to make several contributions to the broader conversation about global priorities, including a cross-cause cost-effectiveness model, surveys of key stakeholders about the inputs to the model, and a series of reports on the cruxes.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7QyemcXLaxNicLNNa/five-years-of-rethink-priorities-impact-future-plans-funding#VII__Funding_needs\"><u>Get involved</u></a></p><ul><li><strong>Funding needs</strong>: While RP has worked hard to build a funding base, some of our plans will not occur without funding before early 2024 (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7QyemcXLaxNicLNNa/five-years-of-rethink-priorities-impact-future-plans-funding#Team\"><u>funding gaps</u></a>).&nbsp;We invite you to donate&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/five-years-campaign\"><u>here</u></a>.</li><li><strong>Ask us anything</strong>: You can also engage with our work by (1) participating in an \u201c<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/db5TbLPSZL2XPeaed/ama-peter-wildeford-co-ceo-at-rethink-priorities\">Ask Me Anything</a>\u201d with Co-CEO Peter Wildeford, (2) by sharing this post with potential collaborators, or (3) by contacting Director of Development&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:janique@rethinkpriorities.org\"><u>Janique Behman</u></a>.</li></ul><h2>I.

Outcomes and impacts&nbsp;</h2><p>Ultimately, RP aims to positively impact others now and into the long-term future. Below is a select list of outcomes from our research, communications, influence, and support efforts.</p><h3>Research</h3><p>Since launching, RP has identified gaps in important, neglected, and tractable cause areas. Our staff have progressed in researching these gaps, drawing conclusions, and attempting to determine next steps. While much of this work is confidential, all of our publicly available research reports can be found in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/research\"><u>database</u></a> on our website. This post focuses on how we think some of our research is contributing to building newer fields and the impacts of our behind-the-scenes work. Since our Animal Welfare team was the first to scale, we currently have more examples of our work in this area.</p><p><strong>Invertebrate welfare</strong></p><p>We\u2019ve explored sentience, welfare concerns, and potential solutions in policy and industry collaboration for invertebrates, such as insects and shrimps. Key outcomes include:</p><ul><li>The Albert Schweitzer Foundation and ProVeg used our research in an EU consultation on authorizing insects to be fed to chickens and pigs.&nbsp;</li><li>Eurogroup for Animals produced a position paper on the use of insects as food and feed that was informed by our non-public research on insect farming and welfare.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>We participated in requests for information processes with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and in public consultations with governmental authorities in the U.K.&nbsp;</li><li>Some industry professionals reached out following our presentation on the black soldier fly at the 2022 Insects as Food &amp; Feed Conference. We also shared our findings at the 2022 Insect Welfare Symposium and in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1467803922000354?CMX_ID=&amp;SIS_ID=&amp;dgcid=STMJ_AUTH_SERV_PUBLISHED&amp;utm_acid=245561464&amp;utm_campaign=STMJ_AUTH_SERV_PUBLISHED&amp;utm_in=DM274768&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_source=AC_\"><u>scientific</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wageningenacademic.com/doi/abs/10.3920/JIFF2022.0041\"><u>journals</u></a>.</li><li>Peter Singer cited RP\u2019s research on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/insects-raised-for-food-and-feed\"><u>insects</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://osf.io/b8n3t/\"><u>shrimps</u></a> in his new book,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/products/animal-liberation-now-peter-singer?variant=40952213110818\"><u>Animal Liberation Now</u></a>.

The project also considered the moral implications of those possible differences. Our research laid the foundation for cross-species cost-effectiveness analyses that inform decisions regarding how many resources funders and organizations should tentatively allocate toward helping each of these species.</p><p><strong>AI governance and strategy</strong></p><p>We have established a multidisciplinary team to tackle strategic questions around the governance of artificial intelligence. The staff work to reduce catastrophic risks related to AI by conducting research and strengthening the field of AI governance. They have addressed a number of questions, and we believe they are now in a position to engage policymakers in Washington, D.C. and elsewhere. Currently, their four main workstreams are:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Compute governance</li><li>China</li><li>Lab governance, and&nbsp;</li><li>U.S. regulations.</li></ul><p>See more about the team\u2019s work and plans in their recent post&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BSmMok4r5ocnD5dqT/rp-s-ai-governance-and-strategy-team-june-2023-interim-1\"><u>here</u></a>.</p><h3>Communications</h3><p><strong>Policy and advocacy</strong></p><ul><li><u>Chile</u>: The Environmental Commission of the Chamber of Deputies invited our Director of Animal Welfare to provide expert consultation as they considered a proposed law to recognize animals as sentient individuals. The Commission decided to advance the bill to the next legislative stage, and cited RP in its report.&nbsp;</li><li><u>EU</u>: Ahead of negotiations on farmed animal protection in 2023, our researchers met with dozens of European animal advocacy organizations to discuss policy strategies for the upcoming years. These collaborative conversations directly shaped how the organizations collectively allocated over $1M USD in their budgets.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Message testing</strong></p><ul><li><u>Existential security</u>: We tested different ways to help a U.K. policy think tank communicate effectively about the long-term future. Through our work, they learned that they could increase the likelihood of success of their policy proposals for existential risk reduction by incorporating language like \u201csecuring a future for our children's children's children\u201d into their communications.</li><li><u>Artificial intelligence</u>: We recently ran a nationally-representative survey of U.S. public opinions on AI that aimed to replicate and extend other recent polls. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ConFiY9cRmg37fs2p/us-public-opinion-of-ai-policy-and-risk\"><u>findings</u></a> suggest that people are cautious about AI and favor federal regulation. However, respondents perceive other risks, such as nuclear war, as more likely to cause human extinction.&nbsp;</li><li><u>Animal welfare</u>: RP has also conducted polls and surveys for some of the largest farmed animal welfare organizations such as The Humane League, Mercy for Animals, and Animal Equality. By providing these advocates with up-to-date information, we aimed to help them develop strategic legislative and corporate policy proposals and messaging to increase their chances of success.</li></ul><h3>Influence</h3><ul><li>Since its inception in 2021, our Global Health and Development team has completed 23 commissioned reports for five organizations. Open Philanthropy (OP) commissioned 78% of these reports. Most projects entailed looking into a specific topic or intervention like hypertension or improving weather forecasting. We believe that our research likely increased the scope of impactful programs considered in OP\u2019s Global Health and Wellbeing portfolio.

Our support includes hiring, payroll/finance, event planning, communications, and additional operational tasks. Noteworthy examples of projects from our incubation program are:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://epochai.org/\"><u>Epoch</u></a> is a research initiative that forecasts the development of transformative AI.

Organizational updates</h2><p>Last year (2022), RP roughly tripled in size. Since 2018, we\u2019ve grown from a start-up with two co-founders to an established organization with 130 people involved, including our employees, people working for fiscally sponsored projects, and contractors. To scale in a healthy way, we needed to make a variety of organizational changes, including:</p><ul><li>Developing HR and people and project management systems.&nbsp;</li><li>Strengthening our Board of Directors by adding five new people with expertise in finance, operations, and the cause areas in which we work.&nbsp;</li><li>Expanding our leadership team to include new strategy and director-level roles.&nbsp;</li><li>Refining our internal processes for high-level decision-making.&nbsp;</li><li>Establishing a Justice, Equity, Inclusion and Diversity (JEID) committee.</li><li>Adding staff focused on areas like training and professional development.</li><li>Commissioning an external review of our practices and procedures.</li><li>Completing an internal risk assessment and mitigation plan.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>While we are not aware of any major or legal risks, we are mindful of the need to (1) diversify our funding sources, (2) to communicate strategically as we reach out to new audiences, (3) to further professionalize our research standards, (4) to continue taking infohazards seriously, and (5) to work to retain key personnel.&nbsp;</p><h2>IV. Lessons learned</h2><h3>Mistakes</h3><p>In a separate&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kP95dWZJR5qKwdThA/five-years-of-rethink-priorities-what-we-ve-learned\"><u>post</u></a>, our co-founders Marcus and Peter reflected (amongst other topics) on the lessons they have learned since they laid out the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zTmxvDQ46tDz4JYDL/announcing-rethink-priorities\"><u>key strategic principles</u></a> for RP in 2018.</p><p>They believe that our biggest early mistake was not building clear plans for how each project would influence decision makers and not putting enough resources into measuring said influence. While we have done internal impact tracking, we have not shared it as publicly as we had planned simply due to time constraints. Moving forward, we plan to share more updates about our plans, strategies, and outcomes.&nbsp;</p><h3>Changes and challenges</h3><p>RP has also changed in ways that we think make sense given our growth and the evolving landscape in which we work.&nbsp;</p><p>As mentioned above, we\u2019re no longer just doing research. We\u2019re also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7QyemcXLaxNicLNNa/five-years-of-rethink-priorities-impact-future-plans-funding#Special_projects_\"><u>incubating</u></a> other organizations and doing more&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7QyemcXLaxNicLNNa/five-years-of-rethink-priorities-impact-future-plans-funding#Policy_and_advocacy\"><u>policy and advocacy</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Even within the research realm, we realize that simply producing quality reports is not enough to have an impact. The way that we try to have an impact is through influencing and supporting the work that other organizations and people are doing. So, our relationships with our stakeholders is integral to our success.&nbsp;</p><p>We are grateful for the relationships that we have developed with organizations like Open Philanthropy and GiveWell, who have entrusted us to explore questions that could shift millions of funding dollars.</p><p>Looking forward, we are cognizant of the need to diversify our base of funders and to initiate relationships with additional audiences. Our heavy reliance on a few donors for funding limits the types of projects we can take on. Furthermore, if the support for our research projects and interest in acting upon our advice from a specific major donor changes, this would severely limit the impact we can have.&nbsp;</p><p>We currently stress the importance of engaging various other philanthropists, foundations, and organizations, exploring new funding models, and diversifying our fundraising approaches. This could help us establish a sustainable funding pool, reduce dependence on a single funder, and expand our reach to a broader audience.</p><h2>V. Future plans&nbsp;</h2><p>We envision the future of RP to involve<strong>&nbsp;</strong>sustainable growth to increase our impact while maintaining our core principles. Working in alignment with our current mission, we aim to clarify and formalize our theories of change, refine our operating model, and actively scan for policy opportunities.&nbsp;</p><p>Below are some of our plans for expansion by cause area, pending adequate funding.</p><p><strong>Animal Welfare Department</strong></p><p>The team plans to continue developing decision-relevant research, including</p><ul><li>Investigating potentially promising policy approaches to help farmed animals and the possibilities to enhance substitution effects of alternative proteins</li><li>Looking into the cost-effectiveness and other assessments of current interventions to help farmed animals</li><li>Investigating and likely uncovering new tractable interventions to help numerous but neglected animals, including fishes and crustaceans used in food production</li><li>Developing and assessing alternative approaches to advance wild animal welfare, with special attention to the tractability of this problem</li></ul><p>Further funding will help the Animal Welfare team in:</p><ul><li>Forecasting theories of change in animal advocacy, producing crucial strategic&nbsp; insights for people in the space</li><li>Developing a live tracker of the cost-effectiveness of farmed animal interventions, starting with corporate outreach campaigns</li><li>Producing country-level and historical data sets of the numbers of different animals slaughtered for food production and animals alive on farms at any time (including aquatic and invertebrate animals), which will help with:<ul><li>improving resource allocation decisions by grantmakers, animal organizations, and evaluators&nbsp;</li><li>spotting trends of the different industries and guiding further research efforts to understand such trends</li></ul></li><li>Developing a strategic roadmap to increase the likelihood of getting the best possible legal protection for aquatic animals, including crustaceans, in the EU</li><li>Producing a farmed insect welfare ask that could be promoted by others, seizing a historical opportunity window to help the farmed animals most commonly killed for food and feed production</li><li>Identifying tractable methods of controlling populations of wild animals living in urban areas, as part of further efforts that may unlock the potential tractability of advancing wild animal welfare in the short term</li><li>Similarly, identifying the quickest agricultural pesticides to control wild insect populations</li><li>Incubating a new project to implement novel interventions to help highly neglected but numerous groups of animals</li><li>Organizing regular meetings and other events to facilitate strategic decision making by leaders in the animal space and to improve the value and impact of research</li></ul><p><strong>AI Governance and Strategy Team</strong>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The team is now focused on rapid-turnaround outputs informing near-term decisions by governments and labs in their four key focus areas: compute governance, the intersection of China and AI governance, lab governance, and U.S. regulations. The staff aims to bridge technical and policy worlds, and to sit at the intersection of strategic considerations and concrete decisions. They also aim to serve as a talent pipeline and improve coordination among relevant actors.</li><li>In each of the focus areas, there are currently significant windows of opportunity, with more demand from decision-makers for work by the team than can be fulfilled by the current staff alone. The team has sufficient management and operations capacity to hire additional staff with further funding. For example, the team could tackle additional crucial questions about the impacts of and ideal changes to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/choking-chinas-access-future-ai\">the 2022 semiconductor export controls</a>, what plausible U.S. regulations on frontier AI systems would be beneficial and counterproductive, and what holes prominent governance proposals leave open and how those can be patched.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Existential Security Team</strong></p><ul><li>The&nbsp;<strong>Existential Security Team</strong> is focused on helping launch entrepreneurial projects that aim to reduce existential risk, by identifying and developing the most promising project ideas, and then finding and supporting founders to make those projects happen. We are currently focused on projects related to AI safety\u2014examples in this area include info/cybersecurity at top AI labs, facilitating people\u2019s transition from AI capabilities research to AI safety research, and field building for AI policy.&nbsp;</li><li>Our team currently has significant unused management capacity\u2014funding is the key bottleneck for us making new hires. Across our entire organization everything we do is running into funding concerns and the core reason we can\u2019t do more is lack of access to funding. New hires would enable us to more quickly investigate the most effective ways to help launch more projects, and ultimately get more projects off the ground sooner, as well as bring additional entrepreneurial expertise into the team.</li></ul><p><strong>Global Health and Development Team</strong></p><p>With additional funding, the team would increase the impact of their current work, build their emerging research agenda, and engage mainstream funders and stakeholders.</p><ul><li>Increase the impact of current work: The majority of the team\u2019s time is spent on commissioned work for major high-impact grantmakers. In some cases, our work doubles the number of investigations of underexplored global issues considered in the grantmaker\u2019s pipeline per year. Additional funding would allow the team to prepare and make public over 30 existing research reports which they think could be additionally impactful with appropriate dissemination.</li><li>Build their own research agenda: The team has a long list of research ideas that they currently do not have the capacity to explore alongside commissioned work. They want to build a line of research into under-researched cause areas in global health, development, and climate change and cross-cutting topics aimed at improving funders\u2019 approaches to effectively identify and evaluate cause areas and interventions.&nbsp;</li><li>Influence mainstream global health and development funders: Additional funding could increase the team\u2019s capacity and enable them to develop new and existing relationships with funders and policymakers. Their aim would be to identify impactful and decision-relevant research and ultimately target the agendas of a wider set of organizations with the goal of influencing them toward more effective interventions and neglected cause areas.</li></ul><p><strong>Survey and Data Analysis Team</strong></p><p>The&nbsp;<strong>Survey and Data Analysis Team&nbsp;</strong>aims to conduct systematic research exploring critical strategic questions. One such area of focus centers on the impact of message framings of existential risks and longtermism among distinct groups. The team also aims to examine public opinion by assessing the levels of support or opposition for specific policies advocated by authors and organizations in our network. Through comprehensive analyses, the team aims to determine the level of support for different policy proposals and identify any significant variations among demographics or interest groups. These efforts will provide valuable insights into attitudes and perspectives regarding existential risk, helping to develop strategies and recommendations based on evidence.</p><p><strong>Worldview Investigations Team</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>The team plans to make several contributions to the broader conversation about global priorities. Among the planned contributions are:</p><ul><li>A cross-cause cost-effectiveness model, which will allow users to compare interventions like corporate animal welfare campaigns with work on AI safety, the Against Malaria Foundation with attempts to reduce the risk of nuclear war, biosecurity projects with community building, and so on.</li><li>Surveys of key stakeholders about the inputs to the model.&nbsp;</li><li>A series of reports on the cruxes, focusing particularly on animals\u2019 moral weights, the expected value of the future, and the tension between making a difference and doing good in expectation.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In addition, the team will continue to work with policymakers and advocacy organizations to implement moral weight considerations into their decision making, amplifying their impact by&nbsp;publishing their findings in venues that facilitate the growth and recognition of this emerging field.</p><h2>VII. Funding needs</h2><p>The past year has seen many changes in the communities in which we operate, leading to the loss of funding previously promised to RP and others and a decrease in available resources. While we have managed to sustain our current operations, realizing our plans for the following year hinges on securing additional funding before early 2024.</p><p>We have often made the greatest impact when we had the freedom to explore new avenues of research.&nbsp;However, this level of flexibility can only be achieved through unrestricted funding. Currently, just 25% of our revenue is unrestricted, limiting our capacity for exploration and innovation.</p><p><strong>Today, we invite you to join us in overcoming this limitation and bringing our plans to fruition.</strong> Your donations will accelerate change when it matters most and enable new research that responds swiftly to emerging challenges.</p><p>Such donations represent true counterfactual support, as we do not anticipate securing the full amount of funding that we could productively spend from institutional funders alone. Additionally, given our size, institutional funders often expect us to secure a significant portion of our funding from individual donors.</p><p>To achieve our impact goals and drive positive change, we have identified specific funding needs for each of our cause areas in 2024:</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#c9daf8;border:0.9999974999999999pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><h3><strong>Team</strong></h3></td><td style=\"background-color:#c9daf8;border:0.9999974999999999pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><h3><strong>Amount (in USD)</strong></h3></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.9999974999999999pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Animal welfare</td><td style=\"border:0.9999974999999999pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">3.5M</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.9999974999999999pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">AI governance and strategy</td><td style=\"border:0.9999974999999999pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">3.9M</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.9999974999999999pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Existential security</td><td style=\"border:0.9999974999999999pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">2.5M</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.9999974999999999pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Global health and development</td><td style=\"border:0.9999974999999999pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">2.6M</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.9999974999999999pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Surveys and data analysis</td><td style=\"border:0.9999974999999999pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">1.5M</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.9999974999999999pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Worldview investigations</td><td style=\"border:0.9999974999999999pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">1.1M</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.9999974999999999pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Total (through EOY 2024)</strong></td><td style=\"border:0.9999974999999999pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>15.1M</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3><strong>By donating to Rethink Priorities today, you will:</strong></h3><ul><li>Put important research in front of influential decision-makers\u2014be they policy makers or funders\u2014during critical moments in the current conversations on AI governance, animal welfare policy, climate change, and other topics.</li><li>Influence new grant-making organizations, and drive additional funding towards important causes.</li><li>Lead to the creation of new, high-potential altruistic projects.</li><li>Provide researchers with the freedom to focus on generating impactful insights, in the knowledge that RP\u2019s operational infrastructure and long-term sustainability are secure.</li></ul><p>Will you join us and fund this future?

There is a serious advantage to those that scale with both: speed-ups, enhancements, and reducing existential risk.</li><li>When people talk about 'speed-ups', they are often conflating two different concepts. I disentangle these into advancements and speed-ups, showing that we mainly have advancements in mind, but that true speed-ups may yet be possible.</li><li>The value of advancements and speed-ups depends crucially on whether they also bring forward the end of humanity. When they do, they have negative value.</li><li>It is hard for pure advancements to compete with reducing existential risk as their value turns out not to scale with the duration of humanity's future. Advancements are competitive in outcomes where value increases exponentially up until the end time, but this isn't likely over the very long run. Work on creating longterm value via advancing progress is most likely to compete with reducing risk if the focus is on increasing the <i>relative</i> progress of some areas over others, in order to make a more radical change to the trajectory.</li></ul><p>The work is appearing as a chapter for the forthcoming book, <i>Essays on Longtermism</i>, but as of today, you can also read it online <a href=\"http://files.tobyord.com/shaping-humanity's-longterm-trajectory.pdf\">here</a>.</p>", "user": {"username": "Toby_Ord"}}, {"_id": "MeigEG9KgJp9jFFuR", "title": "Train for incorrigibility, then reverse it (Shutdown Problem Contest Submission)", "postedAt": "2023-07-18T08:26:20.454Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>The following was my submission to the </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ScGZdyGNXoEBAQazR/winners-of-ai-alignment-awards-research-contest\"><i>AI Alignment Awards Shutdown Contest</i></a><i>, for which it won an honorary mention prize:</i><br>&nbsp;</p><p>My proposal is as follows:<br>1) pre-train a model for broad capabilities (though not to AGI)</p><p>2) create a list of different sub-characteristics that in aggregate yield incorrigibility, but where no single sub-characteristic implies incorrigibility (eg., situational awareness, power-seeking, social persuasiveness, etc)</p><p>3) for each sub-characteristic, construct a task vector[1] from the pre-trained model to a fine-tuned model possessing the sub-characteristic; ie., for each sub-characteristic, fine-tune the pre-trained model for that sub-characteristic (eg., for situational awareness, directly teach it about its physical vulnerabilities) and then subtract the weights of the pre-trained model from those of the fine-tuned model to create the vector</p><p>3) negate each task vector from the pre-trained model (ie., take the weights of the pre-trained model, and subtract each of the task vectors from it)</p><p>4) either train the resultant model to completion, or return to step 1 (iterating through the process, possibly many times).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Research indicates negation of task vectors from model weights can remove specific characteristics with minimal degradation to capabilities (eg., subtracting a task vector for toxicity from a pre-trained LLM leads to both lower perplexity and less toxicity than fine-tuning the LLM on nontoxic text).[1] Further, task vectors are additive \u2013 adding task vectors for two separate tasks to the same pre-trained model can yield a model capable of performing both tasks.[1] My hope is that by negating task vectors for various sub-characteristic of incorrigibility, the model adopts aversion to exhibiting each sub-characteristic. Also, by training simply for each sub-characteristic separately (and iterating over the process multiple times), we\u2019d hopefully avoid ever approaching an AGI with all the incorrigibility sub-characteristics.</p><p>Compared to \u201cdirect attempts\u201d of training for corrigibility, this proposal offers potential benefits. First, it may be easier to target inclusion of sub-characteristics than to target their absence (eg., training a model to&nbsp;<i>not</i> possess situational awareness seems more difficult than training for it). Second, \u201cdirect attempts\u201d may yield models on the edge of incorrigibility, versus the hope here is that task vectors reach deep into the territory of each sub-characteristic and their negation thus pushes far away. Third, \u201cdirect attempts\u201d may lead to deceptive misalignment, where a system instrumentally acts corrigible despite incorrigibility. Under my proposal, it seems unlikely that, analogously, a corrigible model would deceptively act incorrigible during task-vector construction (before being negated).</p><p>This proposal could fail in many ways. Task vectors are a new tool and might not work as initially hoped. Alternatively, they might face other complications, like not aggregating the way this proposal assumes. Further, my proposal might lead to systems that, while corrigible, are incompetent. Additionally, this proposal might yield \u201cshallow\u201d alignment, where a system is corrigible until it reaches a certain level of capabilities, after which it quickly \u201crediscovers\u201d each relevant sub-characteristic. Moreover, a misstep in this proposal might&nbsp;<i>directly</i> lead to incorrigible AGI (eg., a single sub-characteristic being sufficient for incorrigibility). Finally, sufficiently advanced AI with surprising situational awareness might gradient hack during the task-vector construction stage.</p><p>--<br>&nbsp;</p><p>[1] Ilharco, G. et al.

The US Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, and Bank of England instituted stress tests to evaluate bank solvency and liquidity. The tests have quantitative components using economic models and scenarios as well as qualitative evaluations of risk management. There is evidence that the stress tests have restored confidence in banking systems, but it is difficult to conclusively demonstrate the tests prevent crises due to the rarity of crises.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a number of lessons we can take from this report for AI regulation. Firstly, it seems likely that good legislation will only be passed after a crisis has already happened. The Basel Accords provide some evidence against this - none of the was precipitated by the crisis - but they weren\u2019t sufficiently strong to prevent the crisis and took many years to be passed and implemented. On the other hand, despite the well-documented and well-known ability of banks to engage in regulatory arbitrage, there has been no race to the bottom with respect to stress tests. On the contrary, there\u2019s been an extraordinary proliferation of stress testing standards around the world including in China without any explicit coordination between central banks. The key factor behind their spread seems to be the initial success they had in the US at calming the financial markets, and potentially also simply their sound logic.&nbsp;</p><p>An important finding from this report is that it is very strong evidence for the persistence that private regulatory standards, safety and risk management practices can have with a key driver for this seeming to be that it reduces the workload for policymakers and provides a model that they can use that has already had success in the industry being regulated. The lesson from this for AI is that it suggests that it\u2019s highly plausible that lab-based governance practices will be adopted into law.&nbsp;</p><p>A finding particularly relevant for evals of AI systems is that keeping the specifics of evals secret from firms is important to prevent firms from gaming the system by designing their models to specifically pass the tests they know they\u2019ll face. This appears to be accepted best practice with stress tests and a key failure in the financial crisis seems to have been securities created in concrete with credit rating agencies and thereby given good ratings by construction.&nbsp;</p><p>A potential problem that could arise from the regime of private firms acting as evaluators and auditors of AI models, particularly if the AI firms are paying the evaluating and auditing organisations, is that AI firms are able to use their market power to pressure the evaluators and auditors into giving less stringent tests. This dynamic happen prior to the financial crisis and there is a broad consensus in the literature that this played a part in why securities were incorrectly rated prior to the financial crisis which in turn played a part in the financial crisis itself.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, the independence of central banks appears to have been important for two reasons - firstly it meant that they were able to respond quickly and drastically to the financial crisis without the need for new legislation to be approved. Secondly their independence, particularly in a US government context where central banks are structured much more similarly to Weberian bureaucracy than other parts of the US government with the exception of the military, meant that they had a lot more capacity and independence from lobbying to carry out stress tests than previous organisations tasked with carrying out stress tests.&nbsp;</p><p>This pattern was repeated in the EU where stress tests performed by the central bank were much more successful than initial stress tests that were not. All countries seemed to have converged on their central banks carrying out stress tests rather than other financial regulators they may have. Ideally, I think a US AI regulatory body would have the same structure as the Fed but this seems unlikely to be feasible. On the margin, this seems to strengthen the case for the US military playing a larger role in AI regulation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Introduction</strong>:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Stress testing is a risk management practice in which regulators assess how a bank's balance sheet would respond to a hypothetical adverse economic scenario. Major central banks implemented macroprudential stress testing regimes for banks after the 2008 financial crisis revealing risks that existing bank risk models failed to capture. The goal of the macroprudential stress testing regime by the US Federal Reserve, European Central Bank, and Bank of England, amongst other major central banks, was to evaluate whether banks had sufficient capital and liquidity to avoid taxpayer-funded bailouts during crises. By testing banks concurrently, stress tests aim to also capture risks of contagion across financial institutions. Stress tests typically have quantitative components based on econometric models, as well as qualitative evaluations of risk management practices. Stress tests also parallel the regulatory role of credit rating agencies before the crisis, serving as a public regulatory function carried out by independent central banks rather than fully private companies.&nbsp;</p><p>An important piece of general background comes from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.20130456\"><u>Acemoglu et al</u></a>. They model financial contagion as banks failing and, connected by debtor-creditor relations, this failure propagating through the network of banks leading to other banks failing. They find that densely connected networks are protected from small shocks by the density of the network because the liquidity in the network can be shifted around the network to protect all of an insolvent bank's creditors. However, if a shock is sufficiently large that liquidity can\u2019t protect an insolvent bank's creditors then the density of the network means that the failure propagates throughout the network to a greater degree than if the network had been less connected.</p><p>They then show that there\u2019s financial stability negative externality - banks contract to be able to internalise the externality of banks failing on their neighbours but don\u2019t contract to internalise the externalities for banks more than 1 away from them - i.e in a network with only 3 firms all the externalities of firms collapsing is internalised by all firms.</p><p>The implication of this is that there is a negative externality of the risk of the financial crisis in equilibrium without either a public or private effort at regulation to internalise the externality.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How Stress Tests Work</strong>:</p><p><strong>Federal Reserve Stress Testing</strong></p><p>The Federal Reserve's stress testing regime has two main components:</p><ul><li>Dodd-Frank Act Stress Tests (DFAST): Assess bank capital adequacy assuming&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nber.org/papers/w26887\"><u>dividends paid at current rates and no share buybacks</u></a>.

Large banks failed both stress tests and were subsequently forced to recapitalise.&nbsp;</p><p>The significance of the restoration of confidence in the banking system is that it is a measurable way in which stress tests had a positive effect that can be assessed on the relatively short scale with which we have to assess the efficacy of stress tests.&nbsp;</p><p><br>There is also statistical evidence for the success of stress tests.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/jmcb.12146\"><u>Morgan et al</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/scpwps/ecb.wp2054.en.pdf\"><u>Georgescu et al</u></a> look at the evidence for whether stress tests provided new information to markets for the 2009 US stress test based on weather returns for firms were statistically different from normal. In both cases, the identifying assumption is that the announcement on a specific date of the announcement of the results of the stress tests was exogenous to the share price. I find this identifying assumption plausible - it seems like there was essentially no other event on the day of the announcement that could have affected stock prices to a similar degree to the announcement. However, neither paper uses techniques such as placebo tests to attempt to verify the identifying assumptions.</p><p><br>Both Morgan et al and Georgescu find that the announcement of the results resulted in abnormal returns implying that the stress tests provided information for the markets. It is notable that this finding held for both the crisis stress tests of 2009 and 2014 and the start of the EU macroprudential tests in 2016. This provides some evidence that stress tests do have some positive effects, although it of course doesn\u2019t demonstrate that they pass the cost-benefit test.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Evidence from the 2023 banking crisis</strong></p><p><strong>Silicon Valley Bank Failure</strong></p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/svb-review-20230428.pdf\"><u>2022 failure of Silicon Valley Bank</u></a> (SVB) highlights challenges in regulating fast-growing regional banks. SVB expanded rapidly from a niche lender to a tech startup into a mid-sized bank with inadequate risk management. When interest rates rose in 2022, SVB took large losses on its bond portfolio due to inadequate hedging. This sparked a run on uninsured deposits exacerbated by social media.</p><p>SVB was regulated by the San Francisco Fed with less stringent rules than systemic banks. The Fed review blamed poor oversight during its growth and disruption from COVID-19. SVB\u2019s management incentives rewarding risk-taking without balancing risks also played a role.</p><p>On balance, this seems like weak evidence against the efficacy of stress tests. SVB seemed all things considered a well-run bank albeit with poor risk management policies, and certainly was solvent. It, therefore, seems that stress tests should have caught the failure to hedge against interest rate increases. However, there wasn\u2019t substantial contagion as a result of failure (although SVB was still a small bank) and most of the failures weren\u2019t on the part of the stress tests aimed at the structurally important banks where most of the focus of stress tests lies.&nbsp;</p><p>See the appendix for more details on the collapse of SVB.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Credit Suisse Failure</strong></p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=failure+of+credit+suisse&amp;oq=faiure+of+credit+&amp;aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0i13i512l2j0i22i30j0i15i22i30j0i22i30l3j0i15i22i30l2.7446j0j7&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\"><u>failure of Credit Suisse in 2023</u></a> after large losses show orderly resolution is possible for global systemically important banks. Credit Suisse had become undercapitalized after scandals and bad investments. Declining profits led to shareholder dilution, deposit outflows, and debt concerns. The collapse of SVB further strained finances.</p><p>UBS acquired Credit Suisse with significant losses forced onto shareholders and contingent convertible&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contingentconvertible.asp\"><u>(CoCo) bondholders</u></a>. No public bailout was required. Regulations since 2008 enabled the absorption of losses and transfer of assets outside of insolvency. This orderly wind-down of a major global bank suggests that post-crisis reforms made the financial system more resilient, including the macroprudential stress testing regime.&nbsp;</p><p>The converse of this result is that the stress tests didn\u2019t lead to Credit Suisse being capitalised to the degree that it could withstand the shock from the failure of SVB. I mostly don\u2019t think that this is an especially strong critique - Credit Suisse was a poorly managed bank and it was correct that it was taken over by a better-managed bank and good that this could be achieved without contagion. When setting the stress test requirements there must be acceptances of both false negatives and false positives - there is nothing in the failure of Credit Suisse that suggests to me that the ECB stress tests weren\u2019t reasonably close to the Pareto frontier of the false positive and false negative rate.&nbsp;</p><p>The difficulty of course in evaluating the degree to which stress tests successfully prevented contagion following the failure of Credit Suisse comes from the Acemoglu result - it is unclear if the failure would have been large enough to cause contagion. Additionally Credit Suisse - like Bear Sterns and unlike Lehman Bros - didn\u2019t fail but was bought out by UBS. The experience of the financial crisis suggests that a failing firm being bought out can be sufficient to prevent a crisis where had the firm failed a financial crisis would have followed.&nbsp;</p><p>See further details of the collapse of Credit Suisse in the appendix.&nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>Key Findings</strong></p><p><br><strong>Central Bank Independence Critical</strong></p><p><br>The independence of central banks from political pressure was critical for implementing credible stress tests. The Federal Reserve has statutory independence that shields it from industry regulatory capture and political interventions, unlike agencies like OFHEO that regulated Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with inadequate stringency. This independence meant the Fed could take an aggressive supervisory stance despite industry opposition. The Fed's stress tests were more extensive than international Basel II standards or pre-crisis bank regulations. Without the Fed's political autonomy, the stress testing regime likely would have faced greater industry lobbying or legislative opposition. The evidence comes from contrasting the Fed's actions with OFHEO's weak oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which succumbed to regulatory capture.&nbsp;</p><p><br><a href=\"https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/114489/1/821360183.pdf\"><u>Scott et al</u></a> show that the OFHEO stress tests had three key flaws that meant that despite Mae and Mac passing the stress tests with flying colours they needed $191bn in bailout money in 2008 to stay solvent. Firstly, the model was calibrated using the 1993 data that was available when it was first created and has not been updated since then. The authors argue that this is due to the requirement on OFHEO to update fully inform firms of the updates to the model due to simulations in the original legislation, rather than having the authority to unilaterally update the model. Secondly, the model just didn\u2019t consider sufficiently adverse scenarios. The most severe scenario in the stress test had US house prices falling 13% while the actual fall in the financial crisis was 18%. It\u2019s not clear though ex-ante that it was a mistake for the stress tests not to include more adverse scenarios since there is an unavoidable tradeoff between false positives and false negatives in setting the correct upper threshold on adverse scenarios that Mae and Mac were forced to consider. Finally, the model didn\u2019t consider the effects on future revenues in addition to the effects on the return on assets Mae and Mac already owned following an adverse shock to the housing market.</p><p><br>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/svb-review-20230428.pdf\"><u>Fed\u2019s own</u></a> review of the failings that led to the collapse of SVB provides additional evidence for the importance of independence in achieving good outcomes. In their report, they identified pressure by the Trump administration to reduce the regulatory burden on banks as a reason why stress tests on SVB weren\u2019t carried out to the degree that would have prevented the collapse, in addition to concerns from their political masters about whether stress tests were violating due process. It\u2019s unclear to me the degree that this should be discounted on account of it being in the Fed\u2019s corporate interest to try to assert its independence.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Prior to the more successful stress tests in 2014, the EU, via a regulatory agency rather than the ECB,&nbsp; carried out multiple stress tests that completely failed to identify weaknesses in banks that failed soon after they were carried out. It\u2019s very hard to assess the causal effect of the ECB taking over the 2014 stress that was much more successful than previous stress tests judged by market reaction and false negative rate, but it is at least suggestive of a continuation in the pattern of independent central banks carrying out stress tests better than other organisations.&nbsp;</p><p><br>This example relates to competence rather than decisions being distorted by political interference or hamstrung by a lack of operational independence.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Both explanations for the importance of independence are supported by much broader literature on the importance of the independence of state institutions for the development of state capacity. See the appendix on state capacity for more details. This is particularly pertinent in the US context where the only two state institutions staffed at the senior levels by professional civil servants rather than political appointees who are subject to cheap removal by the President are the Fed and the US military. The US is very unusual amongst rich countries in this respect.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Credit Rating Agencies Analogue&nbsp;</strong></p><p>There are analogies between the credit ratings agency regime before the crisis and the emerging paradigm of independent organisations carrying out AI auditing and evaluations.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdf/10.1257/jep.24.2.211\"><u>Credit ratings agencies arose in the early 20th century and their ratings were progressively given legal authority</u></a>. The Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 gave official roles to designated rating agencies. The 1975 NRSRO rules required certain regulated institutional investors to only hold securities rated investment grade by approved rating agencies.</p><p>This codification into law gave huge weight to the judgments of a small number of private agencies. However, flawed incentives and inadequate risk models led rating agencies to systematically underestimate the risks of mortgage-backed securities. Only a few large banks engineered these complex securities, and they were the issuers paying rating agencies to evaluate them. This concentrated market power meant rating agencies had skewed incentives towards pleasing large issuers. Their inaccurate ratings on mortgage-backed securities and related derivatives contributed to the 2008 crisis.</p><p><br>Perhaps the most worrying analogy between the role that rating agencies played in the financial crisis and the emerging paradigm in AI auditing and evaluations is the potential similarity between credit rating agencies playing a role in designing securities that later rate and AI firms knowing in advance the sorts of tests that their models will face. Rating agencies play a role in designing the securities they later rated meaning by construction they achieved high ratings. A similar problem could arise where AI firms construct their models to get safe ratings by the auditors which they wouldn\u2019t have been able to do so had they not known the structure of the tests in advance. Central banks seem to have thought along similar lines by structuring stress tests to have novel scenarios every year and the Fed keeping their models private.&nbsp;</p><p><br>See the appendix for further details on the role of rating agencies in the financial crisis.</p><p><br><strong>No International Race to Bottom</strong></p><p><br>Despite the risks of international regulatory arbitrage, there is no evidence it affected the adoption of bank stress tests. All major jurisdictions implemented stress tests following the 2008 financial crisis. Critically, there has been&nbsp;<strong>no international coordination around the implementation of stress tests.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>There is substantial qualitative and empirical evidence that financial institutions engage in regulatory arbitrage in other contexts.<a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf\"><u> For example, US money market funds faced less regulation than banks so grew substantially as an alternative investment vehicle</u></a>. However, this dynamic has thus far not been replicated in response to post-crisis stress tests. The widespread voluntary adoption shows central banks were relatively unconcerned by regulatory competition undercutting the efficacy of their standards.</p><p>There is also substantial statistical evidence that banks engage in regulatory arbitrage.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/192342/1/content.pdf;Title\"><u>Houston et al</u></a> test for regulatory arbitrage using a variety of methods and with a variety of identification strategies. Funndemtally it\u2019s very difficult to do causal inference in this area there aren\u2019t good natural experiments where there are plausibly exogenous changes in financial regulation. Furthermore, it\u2019s difficult to rule out reverse causation - it is difficult to show that banks don\u2019t, for instance, lobby harder for softer financial regulation in places where they have more assets.&nbsp;</p><p>Houston et al though put together a battery of evidence that consistently shows meaningful, but not overwhelmingly large, effects on where bank assets as a result of the severity of financial regulation. None of their instruments is especially convincing - they use the GINI coefficient, years since independence, and models of regulatory contagion amongst others - but they consistently point to there being an effect. In sum, I think this provides some evidence that there is cross-jurisdiction regulatory arbitrage, but the effect sizes aren\u2019t extremely large.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1572308921001212\"><u>Clark and Ehbrahiem</u></a> look at regulatory arbitrage specifically by seeing if firms moved risk into \u201coperational risk\u201d which wasn\u2019t covered by the Basel I capital accords. Operational risk is essentially a catch-all term covering risks from human error and legal issues.They find that banks that are more constrained in the risks they take by regulation take on more operational risks. Theory suggests that banks closer to the somewhat arbitrary leverage limits imposed on them by regulation would if they weren\u2019t constrained by regulation, take on more risk in exchange for higher expected returns.&nbsp;</p><p>Clark and Ehbrahiem don\u2019t establish more than an associative relationship and also don\u2019t test if this effect goes away after Basel II is implemented. They do however conduct a placebo test which supports their results. Specifically, they test whether operational risk actually being realised has the same effect which they find that it doesn\u2019t. This is evidence against the possibility that the relationship between operational risk and distance-to-leverage ratio minimums is being driven by something other than an optimisation decision on the part of banks.&nbsp;</p><p>The coordination of central banks around stress tests - which are quite costly for the regulated banks - requires explanation. Acemolgu et al results establish that there is a financial crisis externality - the costs of a financial crisis are not contained to the country that it occurs in for a large financial crisis because there is a contagion, as happened in the 2008 financial crisis, the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the Great depression. Furthermore, it\u2019s also been established that banks do move assets to places where there\u2019s less stringent regulation and as well as finding other ways for the regulation not to apply. This seems to create a prisoner dilemma where each central bank is incentivized to defect (at least a degree - lots of the costs of the financial crisis are internalised, particularly in less that perfectly connected financial systems) by having or absent stress tests. Instead, we observe the proliferation of stress tests and the tests in fact greeting stronger over time, for instance with the ECB\u2019s addition of stress tests that focus on liquidity.&nbsp;</p><p><br>At least some of the answers are provided explicitly by Alex Braizer, at the time a senior member of staff at the BoE, in an article in a special issue on stress testing - the US stress tests 2009 was judged to be extremely successful and other central banks wanted to emulate that success.&nbsp;</p><p><br>It\u2019s notable that nowhere in the literature on stress tests, including that written by central bankers, was the issue of regulatory arbitrage discussed. This suggests to me that a cultural explanation is important - engaging in this kind of competition between jurisdictions isn\u2019t in the mandate or culture of central banks and so as action it isn\u2019t considered. I speculate that the effect sizes on the movement assets in response to financial regulation aren\u2019t especially large meaning that the costs of increased financial regulation aren\u2019t especially high.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall though this seems to be an important avenue for future research.&nbsp;</p><p>A final point to consider is the possibility that stress tests actually aren\u2019t costly for the large banks that are most able to influence regulation because it creates greater barriers to entry for smaller banks and therefore protect their oligopoly profits. I think this is unlikely to be the explanation. US banks aggressively and successfully lobbied for less regulation throughout the last quarter of the 20th century and were successful. From this point, finance salaries diverged from non-financed salaries. This strongly suggests to me that the straightforward story where stricter financial regulation hurts large banks is correct.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Industry Standards Influenced Regulations</strong></p><p>Stress tests emerged<a href=\"https://www.bis.org/fsi/publ/insights12.pdf\"><u> in the early 1990s in banks</u></a> and were adopted very quickly by Basel II. Stress tests were pioneered though to measure mortgage credit risks more accurately since the mortgage market was unusually exposed to macroeconomic shocks like increases in the unemployment rate. The practices diffused through the banking sector during the 1990s and 2000s. Following the crisis, central bank stress test regulations built directly on these industry testing norms as well as on the specific techniques used. This created continuity between existing private practices and public oversight, facilitating adoption. Current stress takes make extensive use of bank\u2019s internal stress testing models for instance.&nbsp;</p><p>Credit rating agencies are another example of industry standards influencing regulation, both in terms of the ratings of agencies becoming law and in terms of subsequent regulation of rating agencies coming out of industry standards. The wholesale nature of the adaptation ratings agencies' ratings in 1975 suggests to me that the driving force behind their adoption was that it substantially reduced the workload for the US government. It seems unlikely to me that this emerged as a result of rating agency lobbying. Firstly I\u2019ve found no discussion of this in the literature. Secondly, rating agencies are quite small organisations in comparison to the financial organisations that they became de facto regulators of. Moody\u2019s, the largest of the agencies, has only 3000 employees as of 2023 in comparison to Goldman\u2019s 48,500 also as of 2023. This, in conjunction with the soft power that large financial institutions exert via the revolving door between them and the US treasury and Fed, makes it seem very unlikely to me that the rating agencies would be able to exert more political power than those firms in the area of their core interests.&nbsp;</p><p><br>Rating agencies became more heavily regulated in the US in the wake of the dot com crash and in the EU in the wake of the financial crisis.<a href=\"https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/53684/1/618028064.pdf\"><u> In both cases the regulation was based on the&nbsp;</u></a>ISOCO code, ratings agencies own international standards.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Banks Largely Unable to Game System</strong></p><p>While there is minor evidence of stress test \u201cgaming,\u201d the regime remains binding on bank capital and lending overall.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1042957318300330\"><u>Cornett et al</u></a> use a regression discontinuity design based around the cutoff of initially&nbsp; $100bn and later $50bn dollars in assets for the Fed\u2019s stress tests of systematically important banks to assess changes in bank behaviour around stress tests</p><p><br>They find that banks subject to the stress tests for systematically important banks reduce their dividends and share buybacks in the quarter before the stress tests to a level below those banks not under the stress testing regime while in other quarters their dividends and share buybacks are higher than those other banks - this suggests some gaming of the system&nbsp;</p><p><br>They don\u2019t defend their identification strategy by testing if either there in fact is something structurally different about banks with assets just over $50bn or below or $100bn or (more plausibly) that banks intentionally keep their asset levels below one of the cutoffs to avoid the regulatory burden&nbsp;</p><p><br>I don\u2019t think either of those challenges to identification strategy is particularly dire - Cornett et al look only at stress tests up to 2013 - the stress tests only began regularly in 2011 which makes it seem unlikely to me that banks had enough time to implement a strategy to strategy to keep their assets below either of the cutoffs.&nbsp;</p><p><br>They also find that firms going above the systemically important bank stress test cutoff are associated with firms increasing their spending on lobbying. The authors cite other literature that shows that lobbying spending by firms in financial services is associated with a lower regulatory burden all else equal. However, they don\u2019t demonstrate in the paper that in this specific case firms which spent more on lobbying were able to reduce their regulatory burden.&nbsp;</p><p>However,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w26887/w26887.pdf\"><u>Schneider et al</u></a>. find no evidence that large banks face less stringent stress tests than other banks. They test this by analyzing whether large banks are more likely to pass CCAR tests given their quantitative performance on the Fed's undisclosed stress test models.

A notable example of this followed Citi failing the 2014 US stress tests and their market cap dropping 6% as a result. I find this high-level evidence quite compelling - it demonstrates that the stress tests were strenuous and that systematically important banks did fail them sometimes and had to bear the costs.</p><p>Finally,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pure.ed.ac.uk/ws/portalfiles/portal/304255685/CoombsN2022ESNarratingImaginedCrises.pdf\"><u>Coombs</u></a> provides qualitative evidence that stress tests are having the desired effect. He interviews employees at both the BoE and banks subject to stress tests involved in the process. He finds that in particular the specific scenarios taken seriously by banks and their responses really are tailored to the specific scenario the BoE has constructed.&nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>The crisis was critical to the adoption</strong></p><p><br>The 2008 financial crisis was a crucial catalyst motivating the adoption of tougher bank stress testing.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/tarullo20160926a.htm\"><u>Gradual phase-in of stress tests had been occurring under the international Basel II accord</u></a> but with the negations for the accord starting in 1999, finishing in 2004 by 2008 Basel II was still in the process of being implemented. But the Fed and ECB responded rapidly to the post-crisis need to restore confidence, with the first US-wide stress tests in 2009. The crisis shattered the deregulation paradigm that had ruled prior to 2008 and provided the impetus for new regulation.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;In general, the policy takes months or years to pass through Congress and comes out of often many years of work in academia and think tanks. However, the first stress tests were used by the Fed in 2009 in the midst of the crisis having previously been a quite marginal tool in the central bankers' financial regulation toolbox. This is much faster than such a large piece of legislation would normally take to pass and be implemented and was driven by crisis.&nbsp;</p><p>The public and political support for harsh regulation also seems important and contingent on the financial crisis.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf\"><u>The prior 20 years of US financial regulation policy had been, all things considered, driven by a convection that markets could regulate themselves culminating in the elimination of the separation between investment and commercial banking in 1993</u></a>. The financial crisis shattered the perception of the efficacy of private regulation and seems likely to me to have played a role in the severity (although not punitive or retributive) stress testing regime that was adopted.&nbsp;</p><p>A caveat to this is that had already been a shift towards a more pro-regulatory stance by Fed following the dot com crash and in particular after the high priest of deregulation Alan Greenspan ended his tenure as Fed Chair in 2006 and was replaced by the more pro-regulation Ben Bernanke.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>This is part of a broader pattern in financial regulation.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/glass-steagall-act#:~:text=The%20Glass%2DSteagall%20Act%20effectively,Roosevelt%20in%20June%201933.\"><u>The Glass-Steagal Act</u></a>, the centrepiece of US financial regulation that established the FDIC and separated commercial and investment banking activities was enacted in 1933 in the wake of the great depression.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/fischer20160210a.htm\"><u>The Fed was also established as a lender of last resort as a response to the great depression</u></a>, a policy that eventually became standard practice.&nbsp;</p><p><br>As noted previously, the US adopted more stringent regulations for rating agencies following their perceived failure over the dotcom crash in 2000, and the EU only adopted more stringent regulations after the financial crisis.&nbsp;<br><br><strong>Failure of SVB appendix,&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/svb-review-20230428.pdf\"><u>Fed\u2019s internal assessment</u></a> of what went wrong both at SVB places the blame on poor incentives for management at SVB combined with a relatively basic failure to hedge against interest rate increases at SVB.</p><p><br>Mechanistically, SVB bought US treasures while interest rates were low. Interest rates then dramatically rose in 2022 and early 2023 meaning that the treasuries bought by SVB lost value and when SVB sold those bonds those losses were realised. This sparked a panic about SVB\u2019s solvency which was enhanced by a great majority of SVB\u2019s deposits being uninsured. What followed was a classic bank run exacerbated by the speed the information spreads on Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p><br>At a higher level, SVB\u2019s compensation structure for management incentivised&nbsp;imprudent risk-taking. SVB\u2019s manager's pay was tied to performance but not to risk-adjusted performance. There\u2019s much less evidence that this played a part in the causal chain for SVB\u2019s collapse - only the Fed\u2019s report has highlighted this as a factor amongst the literature I\u2019ve read and more seriously there\u2019s no statistical evidence for this theory nor have I seen any qualitative evidence - for instance, interview\u2019s with SVB managers.&nbsp;</p><p><br>The Fed assessed their own failures as stemming from: the very rapid growth of SVB; the disruption from covid 19; and the policymaking during the Trump administration that pressured to be less strict in their banking regulation.&nbsp;</p><p><br>SVB grew extremely rapidly over the 2010s going from a small regional bank where stress testing was conducted by the SF Fed and liquidity, solvency and risk management practices had lower statutory limits than structurally important banks. SVB passed the $100bn asset mark in 2020 having only passed the $50bn in 2017.&nbsp;</p><p><br>At $100bn the standards used to assess banks are changed and the team that assesses them changes. In the Fed\u2019s own assessment this, in addition to the disruption caused by Covid-19, meant that stress tests carried out on SVB were lower quality than they would otherwise have been.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Failure of Credit Suisse appendix</strong></p><p>Credit Suisse failed following the distress of the US banking system in 2023 but this was the straw that broke the camel\u2019s back.</p><p>In a sense, Credit Suisse was a success of the post-financial crisis regulatory regime. Credit Suisse was a poorly managed bank that made bad investments and had a large number of scandals. As a result, Credit Suisse was becoming progressively undercapitalised as its share price dropped and clients pulled their funds out of the bank. The role of the collapse of SVB and generically the stress on the US financial system in the failure of Credit Suisse was that this made investors more reluctant to have capital tied to a risky institution. The critical event was the refusal of the Saudi national bank - Credit Suisse\u2019s largest shareholder - refusal to inject any more capital into the bank.</p><p>There was no contagion following the failure of the bank - Credit Suisse was a very large, systematically important bank which had assets around 70% of Swiss GDP.&nbsp;</p><p>The failure was resolved via the sale of Credit Suisse to UBS and the use of the \u201cbail-in\u201d bonds - Cocos - pioneered after the financial crisis. Cocos are a high-yield bond which in exchange for the high yield they earn their bonds, unlike other bonds issued by banks, aren\u2019t senior to equity. This was used by Credit Suisse - specifically the highest yield Cocos were entirely written off - to reduce their liabilities to facilitate their sale to USB.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Credit Suisse, therefore, looks in some ways like a success - a formerly too-big-to-fail bank was allowed to fail and its assets transferred to a better-run bank without the use of public funds or contagion to the rest of the financial system.</p><p><strong>Credit rating agencies appendix&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Credit rating agencies played a key role in the financial crisis. The subprime mortgage-backed securities that were at the heart of the financial crisis were systematically rated as less risky than they in fact were by credit rating agencies, who also played a key role in engineering the products and their derivatives. Not only were they systematically rated as less risky than they in fact were, but the senior tranches of mortgage-backed securities were also often rated as prime securities, the highest grade, and so were used as short-term collateral for the repo markets that various financial institutions used to raise capital short term to pay short term debts. When the value of mortgage-backed securities dropped dramatically it meant that banks faced both questions over solvency and over short-term liquidity because they could borrow much less in the repo markets because the value of their collateral had dropped so substantially.&nbsp;</p><p>The solvency problem generically comes about when a large asset class is incorrectly priced while the liquidity problem came about because only very safe assets are used as collateral in the repo market (mostly treasury bonds, generally considered the safest possible debt). Therefore had rating agencies not classed mortgage-backed securities as extremely low risk there would not have been the liquidity crisis that, in particular, sunk Lehmann brothers.&nbsp; Lehman was probably solvent but lacked the liquidity to pay its short-term debts since it could no longer rely on the repo market to the degree it previously had. It is important to note though that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2156006\"><u>Lehman only came to rely on the repo market so heavily as a result of the solvency issues</u></a> caused by its investments in securities tied to the housing market, after the downturn in the housing market that began the financial crisis,&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The key institutional factors behind the failure of credit rating agencies to properly assess risk and why this was so catastrophic:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Credit ratings from agencies were given the force of law - as a result, pension funds and other financial institutions required by law to only invest in very safe assets took the ratings as close to gospel&nbsp;</li><li>Sell-side paid for ratings to be carried out - for MBS and derivatives on MBS only a small number of very powerful firms were engineering these assets giving them a lot of market power&nbsp;</li><li>Unlike corporate and government debt models for assessing MBS+deriviatives debt opaque - much less clear if rating agencies were systematically undervaluing risks and so reputational consequences could act as less strong constraints&nbsp;</li><li>Agencies involved in the financial engineering of MBS+derviratives meaning that almost by construction the financial instruments would be rated as investment grade&nbsp;</li><li>There are negative externalities from underestimating the risk of assets because of the contagion of bad loans in sufficiently large sufficiently interconnected financial systems meaning that we should expect risks to be systematically underestimated relative to the social optimum (although to some degree ratings agencies internalise this in that they lose business if the financial sector shrinks)&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Post financial crisis there have been substantial reforms of the credit ratings agencies, specifically preventing them from providing agencies rating financial products they were involved in designing.&nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>State capacity appendix&nbsp;</strong></p><p><br>The concept of a Weberian bureaucracy, proposed by German sociologist Max Weber, refers to an ideal type of administrative structure characterized by hierarchical authority, formal rules and procedures, division of labour based on expertise, and impersonal relations between administrators and the public. A Weberian bureaucracy is meant to operate in a rational and efficient manner.</p><p>In his 2011 book The Origins of Political Order, Francis Fukuyama argues that the development of modern, centralized state bureaucracies has been crucial to state capacity. According to Fukuyama, a professional bureaucracy with merit-based recruitment and organized hierarchy enables the state to effectively implement policies and provide public services. He points to China's long tradition of bureaucratic governance as an important factor enabling its state capacity. Fukuyama contends that Weberian bureaucracies lead to greater state capacity by insulating public administration from patrimonialism and politicization.</p><p>Similarly, in his 1968 book Political Order in Changing Societies, Samuel Huntington emphasized the need for developing countries to establish coherent, autonomous bureaucracies. He argued that many post-colonial states failed to build effective state capacity because their bureaucracies remained personalized instruments of particular leaders or factions, rather than becoming impersonal administrative structures. For Huntington, modernizing states requires a bureaucracy with a strong sense of corporate identity and morale. Like Fukuyama, he sees merit-based recruitment and promotion as key to having an effective state bureaucracy.</p><p>In his 1957 book The Soldier and the State, Huntington looked specifically at civil-military relations. He argued that a professionalized, apolitical military bureaucracy was essential for state capacity and stability. Huntington contended that keeping the military out of politics required recruiting career soldiers on the basis of merit rather than personal ties.</p><p>In their 2019 book The Narrow Corridor, Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson argue that inclusive economic and political institutions enable the development of state capacity. They contend that extractive institutions that concentrate power undermine the creation of effective bureaucracies. Like Fukuyama and Huntington, Acemoglu and Robinson emphasize building impersonal bureaucracies not beholden to special interests.</p><p>In the United States, the increased political appointment of senior civil servants has raised concerns about politicization eroding bureaucratic professionalism and autonomy. For example, critics argue that appointing agency heads based on loyalty rather than expertise damages state capacity by undermining competent governance.</p><p>In India, the overrepresentation of upper castes in bureaucratic positions, particularly in northern states, has limited state capacity by excluding lower castes from the bureaucracy. Nepotism and patronage in civil service recruitment and promotion have weakened meritocracy and accountability. Caste-based politics have prevented the Indian bureaucracy from becoming fully impersonal and professionalized.</p><p>In conclusion, the literature emphasizes that developing modern bureaucratic structures based on Weberian principles of meritocracy and insulation from partisan politics is essential for state capacity. The experiences of the US and India illustrate the costs to effective governance when bureaucracies are politicized or dominated by narrow interests.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Nathan_Barnard"}}, {"_id": "7zSzAZnWYQWat9qsp", "title": "What do y'all think of pay gaps in EA?", "postedAt": "2023-07-17T19:26:09.523Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7zSzAZnWYQWat9qsp/thittaqmmeyodogvi7di\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7zSzAZnWYQWat9qsp/s7alnts1ym7yxsncez2t 130w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7zSzAZnWYQWat9qsp/ymmrwi9fvto5pqy3avjx 260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7zSzAZnWYQWat9qsp/bawxs448qm5t5xztzyj4 390w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7zSzAZnWYQWat9qsp/kmfrabhkdbxq4lgpdawo 520w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7zSzAZnWYQWat9qsp/flyzspsw2hnqdnz8cciz 650w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7zSzAZnWYQWat9qsp/zzznj6gm5yyfszilwnzq 780w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7zSzAZnWYQWat9qsp/gfndpx3kujgg4mynpxda 910w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7zSzAZnWYQWat9qsp/hjfvsws1ihiru1uhjaov 1040w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7zSzAZnWYQWat9qsp/wajfhx3lgiihrq7xhve6 1170w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7zSzAZnWYQWat9qsp/h7lukzzqv428hcrgltil 1246w\"></figure><p>I saw a CEA role advertised for twice the salary of an AMF job, whereas they do not seem to differ dramatically in expected level of expertise / experience.

I couldn't find something posted about it elsewhere on the forum, so I'll try to summarise here.</p><p>The paper argues that there is a big distinction between what they call <i>public facing EA</i> and <i>Core EA</i>. The former cares about global health and wellbeing (GH&amp;W) whereas the latter cares about x-risks, animal welfare and \"helping elites get advanced degrees\" (which I'll just refer to as <i>core topics</i>). There are several more distinctions between public EA and core EA, e.g. about impartiality and the importance of evidence and reason. The author argues, based on quotes from a variety of posts from a variety of influential people within EA, that for the core audience, GH&amp;W is just a facade such that EA is perceived as 'good' by the broader public, whilst the core members work on much more controversial core topics such as transhumanism that go against many of the principles put forward by GH&amp;W research and positions. The author seems to claim<i> </i>that this was done on purpose and that GH&amp;W merely exists as a method to \"convert more recruits\" to a controversial core of transhumanism that EA is nowadays. This substantial distinction between GH&amp;W and core topics causes an identity crisis between people who genuinely believe that EA is about GH&amp;W and people who have been convinced of the core topics. The author says that these distinctions have always existed, but have been purposely hidden with nice-sounding GH&amp;W topics by a few core members (such as Yudkowsky, Alexander, Todd, Ord, MacAskill), as a transhumanist agenda would be too controversial for the public, although it was the goal of EA after all and always has been.</p><p>To quote from the final paragraph from the paper:</p><blockquote><p>The \u2018EA\u2019 that academics write about is a mirage, albeit one invoked as shorthand for a very real phenomenon, i.e., the elevation of RCTs and quantitative evaluation methods in the aid and development sector. [...] Rather, my point is that these articles and the arguments they make\u2014sophisticated and valuable as they are\u2014are not about EA: they are about the Singer-solution to global poverty, effective giving, and about the role of RCTs and quantitative evaluation methods in development practice. EA is an entirely different project, and the magnitude and implications of that project cannot be grasped until people are willing to look at the evidence beyond EA\u2019s glossy front-cover, and see what activities and aims the EA movement <i>actually </i>prioritizes, how funding is <i>actually </i>distributed, whose agenda is <i>actually </i>pursued, and whose interests are <i>actually </i>served.</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "Jeroen De Ryck"}}, {"_id": "2dntTcMEkDTzMta2D", "title": "Open Philanthropy Undergraduate Scholarship - New Application Round (2023/24)",

One promising way to <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/\">reduce the chances of an AI-related catastrophe</a> is to find technical solutions that could allow us to prevent AI systems from carrying out dangerous behaviour.</p><h3>Pros</h3><ul><li>Opportunity to make a significant contribution to a hugely important area of research</li><li>Intellectually challenging and interesting work</li><li>The area has a strong need for skilled researchers and engineers, and is highly neglected overall</li></ul><h3>Cons</h3><ul><li>Due to a shortage of managers, it\u2019s difficult to get jobs and might take you some time to build the required career capital and expertise</li><li>You need a strong quantitative background</li><li>It might be very difficult to find solutions</li><li>There\u2019s a real risk of doing harm</li></ul><h2>Key facts on fit</h2><p>You\u2019ll need a quantitative background and should probably enjoy programming.

And thanks to Charlie Rogers-Smith for his help, and his article on the topic \u2014 </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7WXPkpqKGKewAymJf/how-to-pursue-a-career-in-technical-ai-alignment\"><i>How to pursue a career in technical AI alignment</i></a><i>.</i></p><h1>Why AI safety technical research is high impact</h1><p><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/positively-shaping-artificial-intelligence/\">As we\u2019ve argued</a>, in the next few decades, we might see the development of hugely powerful machine learning systems with the potential to transform society. This transformation could bring huge benefits \u2014 but only if we avoid the risks.</p><p>We think that the worst-case risks from AI systems arise in large part because AI systems could be <i>misaligned</i> \u2014 that is, they will aim to do things that we don\u2019t want them to do. In particular, we think they could be misaligned in such a way that they develop (and execute) plans that pose risks to humanity\u2019s ability to influence the world, even when we don\u2019t want that influence to be lost.</p><p>We think this means that these future systems pose an <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/existential-risks/\">existential threat</a> to civilisation.</p><p>Even if we find a way to avoid this power-seeking behaviour, there are still <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/#other-risks\">substantial risks</a> \u2014 such as misuse by governments or other actors \u2014 which could be existential threats in themselves.</p><p>There are many ways in which we could go about reducing the risks that these systems might pose. But one of the most promising may be researching technical solutions that prevent unwanted behaviour \u2014 including misaligned behaviour \u2014 from AI systems. (Finding a technical way to prevent misalignment in particular is known as the <i>alignment problem</i>.)</p><p>In the past few years, we\u2019ve seen more organisations start to take these risks more seriously. Many of the leading industry labs developing AI \u2014 including <a href=\"https://deepmindsafetyresearch.medium.com/building-safe-artificial-intelligence-52f5f75058f1\">Google DeepMind</a> and <a href=\"https://openai.com/alignment/\">OpenAI</a> \u2014 have teams dedicated to finding these solutions, alongside academic research groups including at <a href=\"https://people.csail.mit.edu/dhm/\">MIT</a>, <a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/research/research-areas/#aisafety_tab\">Oxford</a>, <a href=\"https://www.davidscottkrueger.com/\">Cambridge</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~focal/\">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, and <a href=\"https://humancompatible.ai/\">UC Berkeley</a>.</p><p>That said, the field is still very new. We think there are only around 300 people working on technical approaches to reducing existential risks from AI systems,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9heahk4dyh6\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9heahk4dyh6\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;which makes this a highly neglected field.</p><p>Finding technical ways to reduce this risk could be quite challenging. Any practically helpful solution must retain the usefulness of the systems (remaining economically competitive with less safe systems), and continue to work as systems improve over time (that is, it needs to be \u2018scalable\u2019). As we argued in our <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/#instrumental-convergence\">problem profile</a>, it seems like it might be difficult to find viable solutions, particularly for modern ML (machine learning) systems.</p><p><i>(If you don\u2019t know anything about ML, we\u2019ve written a </i><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/#what-is-deep-learning\"><i>very very short introduction to ML</i></a><i>, and we\u2019ll go into more detail on how to learn about ML </i><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/#learn-the-basics\"><i>later in this article</i></a><i>. Alternatively, if you do have ML experience, </i><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/speak-with-us/\"><i>talk to our team</i></a><i> \u2014 they can give you personalised career advice, make introductions to others working on these issues, and possibly even help you find jobs or funding opportunities.)</i></p><p>Although it seems hard, there are lots of avenues for more research \u2014 and the field really is very young, so there are new promising research directions cropping up all the time. So we think it\u2019s moderately tractable, though we\u2019re highly uncertain.</p><p>In fact, we\u2019re uncertain about <i>all</i> of this and have written extensively about <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/#best-arguments-against-this-problem-being-pressing\">reasons we might be wrong about AI risk</a>.</p><p>But, overall, we think that \u2014 if it\u2019s a <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/personal-fit/\">good fit for you</a> \u2014 going into AI safety technical research may just be the highest-impact thing you can do with your career.</p><h1>What does this path involve?</h1><p>AI safety technical research generally involves working as a scientist or engineer at major AI labs, in academia, or in independent nonprofits.</p><p>These roles can be very hard to get. You\u2019ll likely need to build up <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital\">career capital</a> before you end up in a high-impact role (more on this later, in the section on <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/#how-to-enter\">how to enter</a>). That said, you may not need to spend a long <i>time</i> building this career capital \u2014 we\u2019ve seen exceptionally talented people move into AI safety from other quantitative fields, sometimes in less than a year.</p><p>Most AI safety technical research falls on a spectrum between empirical research (experimenting with current systems as a way of learning more about what will work), and theoretical research (conceptual and mathematical research looking at ways of ensuring that future AI systems are safe).</p><p>No matter where on this spectrum you end up working, your career path might look a bit different depending on whether you want to aim at becoming a research lead \u2014 proposing projects, managing a team and setting direction \u2014 or a contributor \u2014 focusing on carrying out the research.</p><p>Finally, there are two slightly different roles you might aim for:</p><ul><li>In academia, research is often led by professors \u2014 the key distinguishing feature of being a professor is that you\u2019ll also teach classes and mentor grad students (and you\u2019ll definitely need a PhD).</li><li>Many (but not all) contributor roles in empirical research are also engineers, often software engineers. Here, we\u2019re focusing on software roles that directly contribute to AI safety research (and which often require some ML background) \u2014 we\u2019ve written about software engineering more generally in a <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/software-engineering\">separate career review</a>.</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/4KA7K4denNYwZrBXL/lirm7sbqfhsxml9nszaa\" alt=\"4 kinds of AI safety role: empirical lead, empirical contributor, theoretical lead and theoretical contributor\"></p><p>We think that research lead roles are probably higher-impact in general. But overall, the impact you could have in any of these roles is likely primarily determined by your <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/personal-fit\">personal fit</a> for the role \u2014 see the section on <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/#how-to-predict-your-fit\">how to predict your fit in advance</a>.</p><p>Next, we\u2019ll take a look at what working in each path might involve. <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/#how-to-enter\">Later, we\u2019ll go into how you might enter each path.</a></p><h2>What does work in the empirical AI safety path involve?</h2><p>Empirical AI safety tends to involve teams working directly with ML models to identify any risks and develop ways in which they might be mitigated.</p><p>That means the work is focused on current ML techniques and techniques that might be applied in the very near future.</p><p>Practically, working on empirical AI safety involves lots of programming and ML engineering. You might, for example, come up with ways you could test the safety of existing systems, and then carry out these empirical tests.</p><p>You can find roles in empirical AI safety in industry and academia, as well as some in AI safety-focused nonprofits.</p><p>Particularly in academia, lots of relevant work isn\u2019t explicitly labelled as being focused on existential risk \u2014 but it can still be highly valuable. For example, work in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.13243.pdf\">interpretability</a>, <a href=\"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8842604\">adversarial examples</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.10894.pdf\">diagnostics</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.12654.pdf\">backdoor learning</a>, among other areas, could be highly relevant to reducing the chance of an AI-related catastrophe.</p><p>We\u2019re also excited by experimental work to develop safety standards that AI companies might adhere to in the future \u2014 for example, the work being carried out by <a href=\"https://evals.alignment.org/\">ARC Evals</a>.</p><p>To learn more about the sorts of research taking place at labs focused on empirical AI safety, take a look at:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-alignment-research\">OpenAI\u2019s approach to alignment research</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/index/core-views-on-ai-safety\">Anthropic\u2019s views on AI safety</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.redwoodresearch.org/research\">Redwood Research\u2019s recent research highlights</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.deepmind.com/tags/safety\">Publications from Google DeepMind\u2019s safety team</a></li></ul><p>While programming is central to all empirical work, generally, research lead roles will be <i>less</i> focused on programming; instead, they need stronger research taste and theoretical understanding. In comparison, research contributors need to be very good at programming and software engineering.</p><h2><strong>What does work in the theoretical AI safety path involve?</strong></h2><p>Theoretical AI safety is much more heavily conceptual and mathematical. Often it involves careful reasoning about the hypothetical behaviour of future systems.</p><p>Generally, the aim is to come up with properties that it would be useful for safe ML algorithms to have. Once you have some useful properties, you can try to develop algorithms with these properties (bearing in mind that to be practically useful these algorithms will have to end up being adopted by industry). Alternatively, you could develop ways of <i>checking</i> whether systems have these properties. These checks could, for example, help hold future AI products to high safety standards.</p><p>Many people working in theoretical AI safety will spend much of their time proving theorems or developing new mathematical frameworks. More conceptual approaches also exist, although they still tend to make heavy use of formal frameworks.</p><p>Some examples of research in theoretical AI safety include:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.01820\"><i>Risks from learned optimisation in advanced machine learning systems</i></a> by Hubinger et al.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.alignment.org/blog/arcs-first-technical-report-eliciting-latent-knowledge/\"><i>Eliciting latent knowledge</i></a> by Christiano, Cotra and Xu.</li><li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06738\"><i>Formalizing the presumption of independence</i></a> by Christiano, Neyman, and Xu</li><li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.08345.pdf\"><i>Discovering agents</i></a> by Kenton et al.</li><li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.00894.pdf\"><i>Active reward learning from multiple teachers</i></a> by Barnett et al.</li></ul><p>There are generally fewer roles available in theoretical AI safety work, especially as research contributors. Theoretical research contributor roles exist at nonprofits (primarily the <a href=\"https://www.alignment.org/\">Alignment Research Center</a>), as well as at some labs (for example, Anthropic\u2019s work on <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00805\">conditioning predictive models</a> and the <a href=\"https://causalincentives.com/\">Causal Incentives Working Group</a> at Google DeepMind). Most contributor roles in theoretical AI safety probably exist in academia (for example, PhD students in teams working on projects relevant to theoretical AI safety).</p><h2><strong>Some exciting approaches to AI safety</strong></h2><p>There are lots of technical approaches to AI safety currently being pursued. Here are just a few of them:</p><ul><li><strong>Scalably learning from human feedback.</strong> Examples include <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9M2Ho9I9Qo\">iterated amplification</a>, <a href=\"https://openai.com/research/debate\">AI safety via debate</a>, <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/nd692YfFGfZDh9Mwz/an-69-stuart-russell-s-new-book-on-why-we-need-to-replace\">building AI assistants that are uncertain about our goals and learn them by interacting with us</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.alignment.org/blog/arcs-first-technical-report-eliciting-latent-knowledge/\">other ways to get AI systems trained with stochastic gradient descent to report truthfully what they know</a>.</li><li><strong>Threat modelling.</strong> An example of this work would be demonstrating the possibility of (allowing us to study) dangerous capabilities, like deceptive or manipulative AI systems. You can read an overview in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15324\">a recent Google DeepMind paper</a>. This work splits into work that evaluates whether a model has dangerous capabilities (like the work of <a href=\"https://evals.alignment.org/\">ARC Evals</a> in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.08774.pdf\">evaluating GPT-4</a>), and work that evaluates whether a model would cause harm in practice (like <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AnthropicAI/status/1604883576218341376\">Anthropic\u2019s research into the behaviour of large language models</a> and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01790\">this paper on goal misgeneralisation</a>).</li><li><strong>Interpretability research.</strong> This work involves studying <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/chris-olah-interpretability-research/\">why AI systems do what they do</a> and trying to put it into human-understandable terms. For example, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.09259\">this paper examined how AlphaZero learns chess</a>, and <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03827\">this paper looked into finding latent knowledge in language models without supervision</a>. This category also includes <a href=\"https://www.neelnanda.io/mechanistic-interpretability/\"><i>mechanistic interpretability</i></a> \u2014 for example, <a href=\"https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/\"><i>Zoom In: An Introduction to Circuits</i> by Olah et al.</a>). For more, see <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13243\">this survey paper</a>, as well as Hubinger\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/nbq2bWLcYmSGup9aF/a-transparency-and-interpretability-tech-tree\">a transparency and interpretability tech tree</a>, and Nanda\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/uK6sQCNMw8WKzJeCQ/a-longlist-of-theories-of-impact-for-interpretability\"><i>A Longlist of Theories of Impact for Interpretability</i></a> for overviews of of how interpretability research could reduce existential risk from AI.</li><li>Other <strong>anti-misuse research</strong> to reduce the risks of catastrophe caused by misuse of systems. (We\u2019ve written more on this in <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/#other-risks\">our problem profile on AI risk</a>. For example, this work includes training AIs so they\u2019re hard to use for dangerous purposes. (Note there\u2019s lots of overlap with the other work on this list).</li><li><strong>Research to increase the robustness of neural networks.</strong> This work involves ensuring that the sorts of behaviour neural networks display when exposed to one set of inputs continues when exposed to inputs they haven\u2019t previously been exposed to, in order to prevent AI systems changing to unsafe behaviour. See section 2 of <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.13916.pdf\"><i>Unsolved Problems in AI safety</i></a> for more.</li><li><strong>Work to build cooperative AI.</strong> Find ways to ensure that even if individual AI systems seem safe, they don\u2019t produce bad outcomes through interacting with other sociotechnical systems. For more, see <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.08630.pdf\">Open Problems in Cooperative AI</a> by Dafoe et al. or the <a href=\"https://www.cooperativeai.com/\">Cooperative AI Foundation</a>. This seems particularly relevant for the reduction of \u2018<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence\">s-risks</a>.\u2019</li><li>More generally, there are some <strong>unified safety plans.</strong> For more, see Hubinger\u2019s <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.07532\">11 possible proposals for building safe advanced AI</a>, or Karnofsky\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/rCJQAkPTEypGjSJ8X/how-might-we-align-transformative-ai-if-it-s-developed-very\">How might we align transformative AI if it\u2019s developed very soon</a>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefswlj5i8tn8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnswlj5i8tn8\">[2]</a></sup></span></li></ul><p>It\u2019s worth noting that there are many approaches to AI safety, and people in the field strongly disagree on what will or won\u2019t work.</p><p>This means that, once you\u2019re working in the field, it can be worth being charitable and careful not to assume that others\u2019 work is unhelpful just because it seemed so on a quick skim. You should probably be uncertain about your own research agenda as well.</p><p>What\u2019s more, as we mentioned earlier, lots of relevant work across all these areas isn\u2019t explicitly labelled \u2018safety.\u2019</p><p>So it\u2019s important to think carefully about how or whether any particular research helps reduce the risks that AI systems might pose.</p><h1>What are the downsides of this career path?</h1><p>AI safety technical research is not the only way to make progress on reducing the risks that future AI systems might pose. Also, there are <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/\">many other pressing problems in the world</a> that <i>aren\u2019t</i> the possibility of an AI-related catastrophe, and lots of careers that can help with them. If you\u2019d be a <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/personal-fit\">better fit</a> working on <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews\">something else</a>, you should probably do that.</p><p>Beyond personal fit, there are a few other downsides to the career path:</p><ul><li>It can be very competitive to enter (although once you\u2019re in, the jobs are well paid, and there are lots of backup options).</li><li>You <i>need</i> quantitative skills \u2014 and probably programming skills.</li><li>The work is geographically concentrated in just a few places (mainly the California Bay Area and London, but there are also opportunities in places with top universities such as Oxford, New York, Pittsburgh, and Boston). That said, remote work is increasingly possible at many research labs.</li><li>It might not be very tractable to find good technical ways of reducing the risk. Although assessments of its difficulty vary, and while making progress is almost certainly possible, it may be quite hard to do so. This <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/#this-could-be-extremely-difficult-to-solve\">reduces the impact that you could have working in the field</a>. That said, if you start out in technical work you might be able to transition to <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-policy-and-strategy/\">governance work</a>, since that often benefits from technical training and experience with the industry, which most people do not have.)</li><li>Relatedly, there\u2019s lots of disagreement in the field about what could work; you\u2019ll probably be able to find at least some people who think what you\u2019re working on is useless, whatever you end up doing.</li><li>Most importantly, there\u2019s some risk of <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/accidental-harm/\">doing harm</a>. While gaining <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital\">career capital</a>, and while working on the research itself, you\u2019ll have to make difficult decisions and judgement calls about whether you\u2019re working on something beneficial (see our anonymous advice about <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/should-you-work-on-ai-capabilities/\">working in roles that advance AI capabilities</a>). There\u2019s huge disagreement on which technical approaches to AI safety might work \u2014 and sometimes this disagreement takes the form of thinking that a strategy will actively <i>increase</i> existential risks from AI.</li></ul><p>Finally, we\u2019ve written more about <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/#best-arguments-against-this-problem-being-pressing\">the best arguments against AI being pressing</a> in our problem profile on preventing an AI-related catastrophe. If those are right, maybe you could have more impact working on a different issue.</p><h1>How much do AI safety technical researchers earn?</h1><p>Many technical researchers work at companies or small startups that pay wages competitive with the Bay Area and Silicon Valley tech industry, and even smaller organisations and nonprofits will pay competitive wages to attract top talent. The median compensation for a software engineer in the San Francisco Bay area was $222,000 per year in 2020.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefh3798ed0gpc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnh3798ed0gpc\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(Read more about <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/software-engineering/#how-much-do-software-engineers-earn\">software engineering salaries</a>).</p><p>This $222,000 median may be an underestimate, as AI roles, especially in top AI labs that are rapidly scaling up their work in AI, often pay <i>better</i> than other tech jobs, and the same applies to safety researchers \u2014 even those in nonprofits.</p><p>However, <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/academic-research/#lower-salaries\">academia has lower salaries than industry in general</a>, and we\u2019d guess that AI safety research roles in academia pay less than commercial labs and nonprofits.</p><h1>How to predict your fit in advance</h1><p>You\u2019ll generally need a quantitative background (although not necessarily a background in computer science or machine learning) to enter this career path.</p><p>There are two main approaches you can take to predict your fit, and it\u2019s helpful to do both:</p><ul><li><strong>Try it out</strong>: try out the first few steps in the <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/#learn-the-basics\">section below on learning the basics</a>.

(<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/YDF7XhMThhNfHfim9/ai-safety-needs-great-engineers\">Read more</a>.)</li></ul></li><li><strong>Testing your fit for theoretical research</strong>: If you could have gotten into a top 10 maths or theoretical computer science PhD programme if you\u2019d optimised your undergrad to do so, that\u2019s a decent indication of your fit (and many researchers in fact have these PhDs). The <a href=\"https://www.alignment.org/blog/early-2022-hiring-round/\">Alignment Research Center</a> (one of the few organisations that hires for theoretical research contributors, as of 2023) said that they were open to hiring people without any research background. They gave four tests of fit: creativity (e.g. you may have ideas for solving open problems in the field, like <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WwsnJQstPq91_Yh-Ch2XRL8H_EpsnjrC1dwZXR37PC8/edit\">Eliciting Latent Knowledge</a>); experience designing algorithms, proving theorems, or formalising concepts; broad knowledge of maths and computer science; and having thought a lot about the AI alignment problem in particular.</li><li><strong>Testing your fit as a research lead (or for a PhD)</strong>: The vast majority of research <i>leads</i> have a PhD. Also, many (but definitely not all) AI safety technical research roles will require a PhD \u2014 and if they don\u2019t, having a PhD (or being the sort of person that could get one) would definitely help show that you\u2019re a good fit for the work. To get into a top 20 machine learning PhD programme, you\u2019d probably need to publish something like a first author workshop paper, as well as a third author conference paper at a major ML conference (like <a href=\"https://nips.cc/\">NeurIPS</a> or <a href=\"https://icml.cc/\">ICML</a>).

We\u2019ll go through four key questions:</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/#learn-the-basics\">How to learn the basics</a></li><li><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/#should-you-do-a-phd\">Whether you should do a PhD</a></li><li><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/#getting-a-job-empirical-research\">How to get a job in empirical research</a></li><li><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/#getting-a-job-theoretical-research\">How to get a job in theoretical research</a></li></ol><p>Hopefully, by the end of the section, you\u2019ll have everything you need to get going.</p><h2>Learning the basics</h2><p>To get anywhere in the world of AI safety technical research, you\u2019ll likely need a background knowledge of <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/#learning-to-program\">coding</a>, <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/#learning-the-maths\">maths</a>, and <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/#basic-machine-learning\">deep learning</a>.</p><p>You might also want to practice enough to become a decent ML engineer (although this is generally more useful for empirical research), and <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/#basic-machine-learning\">learn a bit about safety techniques in particular</a> (although this is generally more useful for empirical research leads and theoretical researchers).</p><p>We\u2019ll go through each of these in turn.</p><h3>Learning to program</h3><p>You\u2019ll probably want to learn to code in python, because it\u2019s the most widely used language in ML engineering.</p><p>The first step is probably just trying it out. As a complete beginner, you can write <a href=\"http://blog.udacity.com/2015/01/remind-friend-take-break-python-program.html\">a Python program</a> in less than 20 minutes that reminds you to take a break every two hours. Don\u2019t be discouraged if <a href=\"https://medium.com/free-code-camp/things-i-wish-someone-had-told-me-when-i-was-learning-how-to-code-565fc9dcb329\">your code doesn\u2019t work the first time</a> \u2014 that\u2019s what normally happens when people code!</p><p>Once you\u2019ve done that, you have a few options:</p><ul><li><strong>Teach yourself to program.</strong> Try working through a free beginner course like <a href=\"https://automatetheboringstuff.com/2e/chapter0/\"><i>Automate the boring stuff with Python</i></a> by Al Seigart. There also are many great introductory computer science and programming courses online, including: <a href=\"https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-computer-science--cs101\">Udacity\u2019s Intro to Computer Science</a>, <a href=\"http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/\">MIT\u2019s Introduction to Computer Science and Programming</a>, and <a href=\"http://videolectures.net/stanfordcs106af07_programming_methodology/\">Stanford\u2019s Programming Methodology</a>. Then, try finding something you want to build, and building it \u2014 or getting involved in an open-source project. For interview practice, try <a href=\"https://leetcode.com/\">leetcode</a> or <a href=\"https://www.topcoder.com/\">TopCoder</a>, or the exercises in <a href=\"https://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/\"><i>Cracking the Coding Interview</i></a> by Gayle McDowell.</li><li><strong>Take a college course.</strong> If you\u2019re in university, this is a great option because it allows you to learn programming while the opportunity cost of your time is lower. You can even consider majoring in computer science (or another subject involving lots of programming).</li><li><strong>Learn on the job.</strong> If you can find internships, you\u2019ll gain practical experience and <a href=\"https://missing.csail.mit.edu/\">skills you otherwise wouldn\u2019t pick up</a> from academic degrees.</li><li><strong>Go to a bootcamp.</strong> Coding bootcamps are focused on taking people with little knowledge of programming to as highly paid a job as possible within a couple of months \u2014 though some claim the long-term prospects are not as good because you lack a deep understanding of computer science. <a href=\"https://www.coursereport.com/\">Course Report</a> is a great guide to choosing a bootcamp. Be careful to avoid <a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20170109105128/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2016-12-06/want-a-job-in-silicon-valley-keep-away-from-coding-schools\">low-quality bootcamps</a>. You can also find online bootcamps \u2014 for people completely new to programming \u2014 focused on ML, like Udemy\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.udemy.com/course/python-for-data-science-and-machine-learning-bootcamp/\"><i>Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp</i></a>.</li></ul><p>You can read more about learning to program \u2014 and how to get your first job in software engineering (if that\u2019s the route you want to take) \u2014 in our <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/software-engineering/#how-to-enter\">career review on software engineering</a>.</p><h3>Learning the maths</h3><p>The maths of deep learning relies heavily on calculus and linear algebra, and statistics can be useful too \u2014 although generally learning the maths is much less important than programming and basic, practical ML.</p><p>We\u2019d generally recommend studying a quantitative degree (like maths, computer science or engineering), most of which will cover all three areas pretty well.</p><p>If you want to actually get good at maths, you <i>have</i> to be solving problems. So, generally, the most useful thing that textbooks and online courses provide isn\u2019t their explanations \u2014 it\u2019s a set of exercises to try to solve, in order, with some help if you get stuck.</p><p>If you want to self-study (especially if you don\u2019t have a quantitative degree) here are some possible resources:</p><ul><li><strong>Calculus</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr\">3blue1brown\u2019s video series on calculus</a> could be a good place to start. You may also be able to follow recorded university courses: MIT\u2019s <a href=\"https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-01sc-single-variable-calculus-fall-2010/pages/syllabus/\">single variable calculus</a> (which requires only high school algebra and trigonometry) followed by MIT\u2019s course in <a href=\"https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-02sc-multivariable-calculus-fall-2010/pages/syllabus/\">vector and multivariable calculus</a>.</li><li><strong>Linear algebra</strong>: Again, we\u2019d suggest <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab\">3blue1brown\u2019s video series on linear algebra</a> as a place to start. In his <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7WXPkpqKGKewAymJf/how-to-pursue-a-career-in-technical-ai-alignment\">post about technical alignment careers</a>, Rogers-Smith recommends <a href=\"https://linear.axler.net/\"><i>Linear Algebra Done Right</i></a> by Sheldon Axler. Finally, if you prefer lectures, try <a href=\"https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-06-linear-algebra-spring-2010/pages/syllabus/\">MIT\u2019s undergraduate course in linear algebra</a> (although note that this course assumes knowledge of multivariate calculus).</li><li><strong>Probability</strong>: Take a look at <a href=\"https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/18-600-probability-and-random-variables-fall-2019/pages/syllabus/\">MIT\u2019s undergraduate course in probability and random variables</a>.</li></ul><p>You might be able to find resources that cover all these areas, like Imperial College\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning\">Mathematics for Machine Learning</a>.</p><h3>Learning basic machine learning</h3><p>You\u2019ll likely need to have a decent understanding of how AI systems are currently being developed. This will involve learning about machine learning and neural networks, before diving into any specific subfields of deep learning.</p><p>Again, there\u2019s the option of covering this at university. If you\u2019re currently at college, it\u2019s worth checking if you can take an ML course even if you\u2019re not majoring in computer science.</p><p>There\u2019s one important caveat here: you\u2019ll learn a huge amount on the job, and the amount you\u2019ll need to know in advance for any role or course will vary hugely! Not even top academics know <i>everything</i> about their fields. It\u2019s worth trying to find out how much you\u2019ll need to know for the role you want to do before you invest hundreds of hours into learning about ML.</p><p>With that caveat in mind, here are some suggestions of places you might start if you want to self-study the basics:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZHQObOWTQDNU6R1_67000Dx_ZCJB-3pi\">3blue1brown\u2019s series on neural networks</a> is a really great place to start for beginners.</li><li>When I was learning, I used <a href=\"http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/\"><i>Neural Networks and Deep Learning</i></a> \u2014 it\u2019s an online textbook, good if you\u2019re familiar with the maths, with some helpful exercises as well.</li><li>Online intro courses like <a href=\"https://course.fast.ai/\">fast.ai</a> (focused on practical applications), <a href=\"https://fullstackdeeplearning.com/\"><i>Full Stack Deep Learning</i></a>, and the various courses at <a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/\">deeplearning.ai</a>.</li><li>For more detail, see university courses like MIT\u2019s <a href=\"https://openlearninglibrary.mit.edu/courses/course-v1:MITx+6.036+1T2019/course/\">*Introduction to Machine Learning</a>, NYU\u2019s <a href=\"https://atcold.github.io/pytorch-Deep-Learning/\"><i>Deep Learning</i></a> for even more detail. We\u2019d also recommend Google DeepMind\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqYmG7hTraZCRwoyGxvQkqVrZgDQi4m-5\">lecture series</a>.</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html\">PyTorch</a> is a very common package used for implementing neural networks, and probably worth learning! When I was first learning about ML, my first neural network was a 3-layer <a href=\"https://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/\">convolutional neural network</a> with <a href=\"https://cs231n.github.io/neural-networks-2/\">L2 regularisation</a> classifying characters from the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database\">MNIST database</a>. This is a pretty common first challenge, and a good way to learn PyTorch.</p><h3>Learning about AI safety</h3><p>If you\u2019re going to work as an AI safety researcher, it usually helps to know about AI safety.</p><p>This isn\u2019t always true \u2014 some engineering roles won\u2019t require much knowledge of AI safety. But even then, knowing the basics will probably help land you a position, and can also help with things like making difficult judgement calls and avoiding doing harm. And if you want to be able to identify and do useful work, you\u2019ll need to learn about the field eventually.</p><p>Because the field is still so new, there probably aren\u2019t (yet) university courses you can take. So you\u2019ll need to do some self-study. Here are some places you might start:</p><ul><li>Section 3 of our <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/#power-seeking-ai\">problem profile about preventing an AI-related catastrophe</a> provides an introduction to the problems that AI safety attempts to solve (with a particular focus on alignment).</li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/RobertMilesAI\">Rob Miles\u2019 YouTube channel</a> is full of popular and well-explained introductory videos that don\u2019t need much background knowledge of ML.</li><li><a href=\"https://axrp.net/\">AXRP</a> \u2013 the AI X-risk Research Podcast \u2014 is full of in-depth (and enjoyable) conversations with researchers about their research.</li><li>The courses from <a href=\"https://www.agisafetyfundamentals.com/\">AGI Safety Fundamentals</a>, in particular the <a href=\"https://www.agisafetyfundamentals.com/ai-alignment-curriculum\"><i>AI Alignment Course</i></a>, possibly followed by <a href=\"https://www.agisafetyfundamentals.com/alignment-201-curriculum\"><i>Alignment 201</i></a>, which provide an introduction to research on the alignment problem.</li><li><a href=\"https://course.mlsafety.org/about\"><i>Intro to ML Safety</i></a>, a course from the <a href=\"https://www.safe.ai/\">Center for AI Safety</a> focuses on withstanding hazards (\u201crobustness\u201d), identifying hazards (\u201cmonitoring\u201d), and reducing systemic hazards (\u201csystemic safety\u201d), as well as alignment.</li></ul><p>For more suggestions \u2014 especially when it comes to reading about the nature of the risks we might face from AI systems \u2014 take a look at the <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/#top-resources-to-learn-more\">top resources to learn more</a> from our problem profile.</p><h2>Should you do a PhD?</h2><p>Some technical research roles will require a PhD \u2014 but many won\u2019t, and PhDs aren\u2019t the best option for everyone.</p><p>The main benefit of doing a PhD is probably practising setting and carrying out your <i>own</i> research agenda. As a result, getting a PhD is practically the default if you want to be a research lead.</p><p>That said, you can also become a research lead without a PhD \u2014 in particular, by transitioning from a role as a research contributor. At some large labs, the boundary between being a contributor and a lead is increasingly blurry.</p><p>Many people find PhDs very difficult. They can be isolating and frustrating, and take a very long time (4\u20136 years). What\u2019s more, both your quality of life and the amount you\u2019ll learn will depend on your supervisor \u2014 and it can be really difficult to figure out in advance whether you\u2019re making a good choice.</p><p>So, if you\u2019re considering doing a PhD, here are some things to consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Your long-term vision</strong>: If you\u2019re aiming to be a research lead, that suggests you might want to do a PhD \u2014 the vast majority of research leads have PhDs. If you mainly want to be a contributor (e.g. an ML or software engineer), that suggests you might not. If you\u2019re unsure, you should try doing something to <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/personal-fit/\">test your fit for each</a>, like trying a project or internship. You might try a pre-doctoral research assistant role \u2014 if the research you do is relevant to your future career, these can be good career capital, whether or not you do a PhD.</li><li><strong>The topic of your research</strong>: It\u2019s easy to let yourself become tied down to a PhD topic you\u2019re not confident in. If the PhD you\u2019re considering would let you work on something that seems useful for AI safety, it\u2019s probably \u2014 all else equal \u2014 better for your career, and the research itself might have a positive impact as well.</li><li><strong>Mentorship</strong>: What are the supervisors or managers like at the opportunities open to you? You might be able to find ML engineering or research roles in industry where you could learn much more than you would in a PhD \u2014 or vice versa. When picking a supervisor, try reaching out to the current or former students of a prospective supervisor and asking them some frank questions. (Also, see <a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1009330\">this article</a> on how to choose a PhD supervisor.)</li><li><strong>Your fit for the work environment</strong>: Doing a PhD means working on your own with very little supervision or feedback for long periods of time. Some people thrive in these conditions! But some really don\u2019t and find PhDs extremely difficult.</li></ul><p>Read more in our more detailed (but less up-to-date) review of <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/machine-learning-phd/\">machine learning PhDs</a>.</p><p>It\u2019s worth remembering that most jobs don\u2019t <i>need</i> a PhD. And for some jobs, especially empirical research contributor roles, even if a PhD would be helpful, there are often better ways of getting the career capital you\u2019d need (for example, working as a software or ML engineer). We\u2019ve interviewed two ML engineers who have had hugely successful careers <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/olsson-and-ziegler-ml-engineering-and-safety/\">without doing a PhD</a>.</p><h3>Whether you should do a PhD doesn\u2019t depend (much) on timelines</h3><p>We think it\u2019s plausible that we will develop AI that could be hugely transformative for society <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/#when-can-we-expect-to-develop-transformative-AI\">by the end of the 2030s</a>.</p><p>All else equal, that possibility could argue for trying to have an impact right away, rather than spending five (or more) years doing a PhD.</p><p>Ultimately, though, <strong>how well you, in particular, are suited to a particular PhD</strong> is probably a much more important factor than when AI will be developed.</p><p>That is to say, we think the <i>increase</i> in impact caused by choosing a path that\u2019s a good fit for you is probably larger than any <i>decrease</i> in impact caused by delaying your work. This is in part because the spread in impact caused by the specific roles available to you, as well as your personal fit for them, is usually very large. Some roles (especially research lead roles) will just <i>require</i> having a PhD, and others (especially more engineering-heavy roles) won\u2019t \u2014 and people\u2019s fit for these paths varies quite a bit.</p><p>We\u2019re also highly uncertain about <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/#when-can-we-expect-to-develop-transformative-AI\">estimates about when we might develop transformative AI</a>. This uncertainty reduces the <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/expected-value/\">expected</a> cost of any delay.</p><p>Most importantly, we think PhDs <i>shouldn\u2019t</i> be thought of as a pure delay to your impact. You can do useful work in a PhD, and generally, the first couple of years in any career path will involve a lot of learning the basics and getting up to speed. So if you have a good mentor, work environment, and choice of topic, your PhD work could be as good as, or possibly better than, the work you\u2019d do if you went to work elsewhere early in your career. And if you suddenly receive evidence that we have less time than you thought, it\u2019s relatively easy to drop out.</p><p>There are lots of other considerations here \u2014 for a rough overview, and some discussion, see <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jfLjsxcejCFDpo7dw/whether-you-should-do-a-phd-doesn-t-depend-much-on-timelines\">this post by 80,000 Hours advisor Alex Lawsen</a>, as well as the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jfLjsxcejCFDpo7dw/whether-you-should-do-a-phd-doesn-t-depend-much-on-timelines?commentId=oCxAANy3yoa3YZbwu\">comments</a>.</p><p>Overall, we\u2019d suggest that instead of worrying about a delay to your impact, think instead about which longer-term path you want to pursue, and how the specific opportunities in front of you will get you there.</p><h3>How to get into a PhD</h3><p>ML PhDs can be very competitive. To get in, you\u2019ll probably need a few publications (as we said above, something like a first author workshop paper, as well as a third author conference paper at a major ML conference (like <a href=\"https://nips.cc/\">NeurIPS</a> or <a href=\"https://icml.cc/\">ICML</a>), and references, probably from ML academics. (Although publications also look good whatever path you end up going down!)</p><p>To end up at that stage, you\u2019ll need a fair bit of luck, and you\u2019ll also need to find ways to get some research experience.</p><p>One option is to do a master\u2019s degree in ML, although make sure it\u2019s a research masters \u2014 most ML master\u2019s degrees primarily focus on preparation for industry.</p><p>Even better, try getting an internship in an ML research group. Opportunities include <a href=\"https://riss.ri.cmu.edu/\">RISS</a> at Carnegie Mellon University, <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/urop/\">UROP</a> at Imperial College London, <a href=\"https://www.aalto.fi/en/aalto-science-institute-asci/aalto-science-institute-international-summer-research-programme\">the Aalto Science Institute international summer research programme</a>, the <a href=\"https://data-science.llnl.gov/dssi\">Data Science Summer Institute</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.ttic.edu/visiting-student/\">Toyota Technological Institute intern programme</a> and <a href=\"https://mila.quebec/en/supervision-requests/\">MILA</a>. You can also try doing an internship specifically in AI safety, for example at <a href=\"https://humancompatible.ai/jobs#internship\">CHAI</a>, although there are disadvantages to this approach: it may be harder to publish, and mentorship might be more limited.</p><p>Another way of getting research experience is by asking whether you can work with researchers. If you\u2019re already at a top university, it can be easiest to reach out to people working at the university you\u2019re studying at.</p><p>PhD students or post-docs can be more responsive than professors, but eventually, you\u2019ll want a few professors you\u2019ve worked with to provide references, so you\u2019ll need to get in touch. Professors tend to get lots of cold emails, so try to get their attention! You can try:</p><ul><li>Getting an introduction, for example from a professor who\u2019s taught you</li><li>Mentioning things you\u2019ve done (your grades, relevant courses you\u2019ve taken, your GitHub, any ML research papers you\u2019ve attempted to replicate as practice)</li><li>Reading some of their papers and the main papers in the field, and mention them in the email</li><li>Applying for <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7WXPkpqKGKewAymJf/how-to-pursue-a-career-in-technical-ai-alignment#Funding\">funding that\u2019s available to students who want to work in AI safety</a>, and letting people know you\u2019ve got funding to work with them</li></ul><p>Ideally, you\u2019ll find someone who supervises you well and has time to work with you (that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean the most famous professor \u2014 although it helps a lot if they\u2019re regularly publishing at top conferences). That way, they\u2019ll get to know you, you can impress them, and they\u2019ll provide an amazing reference when you apply for PhDs.</p><p>It\u2019s very possible that, to get the publications and references you\u2019ll need to get into a PhD, you\u2019ll need to spend a year or two working as a research assistant, although these positions can also be quite competitive.</p><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RFo7_9JVmt0z8RPwUjB-mUMgCMoUQmsaj2CM5aHvxCw/edit\">This guide by Adam Gleave</a> also goes into more detail on how to get a PhD, including where to apply and tips on the application process itself. We discuss ML PhDs in more detail in our <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/machine-learning-phd/\">career review on ML PhDs</a> (though it\u2019s outdated compared to this career review).</p><h2>Getting a job in empirical AI safety research</h2><p>Ultimately, the best way of learning to do empirical research \u2014 especially in contributor and engineering-focused roles \u2014 is to work somewhere that does both high-quality engineering and cutting-edge research.</p><p>The top three labs are probably Google DeepMind (who offer <a href=\"https://ai-jobs.net/job/28354-research-engineer-intern-2023-london/\">internships to students</a>), OpenAI (who have a 6-month <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/openai-residency\">residency programme</a>) and Anthropic. (Working at a leading AI lab carries with it some risk of doing harm, so it\u2019s important to think carefully about your options. <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-an-AI-lab/\">We\u2019ve written a separate article going through the major relevant considerations.</a>)</p><p>To end up working in an empirical research role, you\u2019ll probably need to build some <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-capital\">career capital</a>.</p><p>Whether you want to be a research lead or a contributor, it\u2019s going to help to become a really good software engineer. The best ways of doing this usually involve <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/software-engineering/\">getting a job as a software engineer at a big tech company or at a promising startup</a>. (We\u2019ve written an entire article about <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/software-engineering/\">becoming a software engineer</a>.)</p><p>Many roles will require you to be a good ML engineer, which means going further than just <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/#basic-machine-learning\">the basics</a> we looked at above. The best way to become a good ML engineer is to <i>get a job doing ML engineering</i> \u2014 and the best places for that are probably <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-an-AI-lab/\">leading AI labs</a>.</p><p>For roles as a research lead, you\u2019ll need relatively more research experience. You\u2019ll either want to become a research contributor first, or enter through academia (for example by doing a PhD).</p><p>All that said, it\u2019s important to remember that you don\u2019t need to know <i>everything</i> to start applying, as you\u2019ll inevitably learn loads on the job \u2014 so do try to find out what you\u2019ll need to learn to land the <i>specific</i> roles you\u2019re considering.</p><p>How much experience do you need to get a job? It\u2019s worth reiterating the tests we looked at above for contributor roles:</p><ul><li>In a <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/nzmCvRvPm4xJuqztv/deepmind-is-hiring-for-the-scalable-alignment-and-alignment\">blog post about hiring for safety researchers</a>, the DeepMind team said \u201cas a rough test for the Research Engineer role, if you can reproduce a typical ML paper in a few hundred hours and your interests align with ours, we\u2019re probably interested in interviewing you.\u201d</li><li>Looking specifically at <i>software engineering</i>, one hiring manager at Anthropic said that if you could, with a few weeks\u2019 work, write a new feature or fix a serious bug in a major ML library, they\u2019d want to interview you straight away. (<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/YDF7XhMThhNfHfim9/ai-safety-needs-great-engineers\">Read more</a>.)</li></ul><p>In the process of getting this experience, you might end up working in roles that advance AI capabilities. There are a variety of views on whether this might be harmful \u2014 so we\u2019d suggest reading our <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-an-AI-lab/\">article about working at leading AI labs</a> and our <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/ai-capabilities/\">article containing anonymous advice from experts about working in roles that advance capabilities.</a> It\u2019s also worth <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/speak-with-us/\">talking to our team about any specific opportunities you have</a>.</p><p>If you\u2019re doing another job, or a degree, or think you need to learn some more before trying to change careers, there are a few good ways of getting more experience doing ML engineering that go beyond the basics we\u2019ve already covered:</p><ul><li><strong>Getting some experience in software / ML engineering.</strong> For example, if you\u2019re doing a degree, you might try an internship as a software engineer during the summer. DeepMind offer <a href=\"https://ai-jobs.net/job/28354-research-engineer-intern-2023-london/\">internships</a> for students with at least two years of study in a technical subject,</li><li><strong>Replicating papers.</strong> One great way of getting experience doing ML engineering, is to replicate some papers in whatever sub-field you might want to work in. Richard Ngo, an AI governance researcher at OpenAI, has written some <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fRjj6nm9xbW4kFcTZ/advice-on-pursuing-technical-ai-safety-research#2_1__Advice_on_paper_replication\">advice on replicating papers</a>. But bear in mind that replicating papers can be quite hard \u2014 take a look at <a href=\"http://amid.fish/reproducing-deep-rl\">Amid Fish\u2019s blog on what he learned replicating a deep RL paper</a>. Finally, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7WXPkpqKGKewAymJf/how-to-pursue-a-career-in-technical-ai-alignment#How_to_pursue_research_contributor__ML_engineering__roles\">Rogers-Smith has some suggestions on papers to replicate</a>. If you do spend some time replicating papers, remember that when you get to applying for roles, it will be really useful to be able to prove you\u2019ve done the work. So try uploading your work to GitHub, or writing a blog on your progress. And if you\u2019re thinking about spending a long time on this (say, over 100 hours), try to get some feedback on the papers you might replicate before you start \u2014 you could even reach out to a lab you want to work for.</li><li><strong>Taking or following a more in-depth course in empirical AI safety research.</strong> Redwood Research ran the <a href=\"https://www.redwoodresearch.org/mlab\">MLAB</a> bootcamp, and you can apply for access to their curriculum <a href=\"https://airtable.com/shrOOfZIZC4zZtAIr\">here</a>. You could also take a look at <a href=\"https://github.com/jacobhilton/deep_learning_curriculum\">this Deep Learning Curriculum</a> by Jacob Hilton, a researcher at the Alignment Research Center \u2014 although it\u2019s probably very challenging without mentorship.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2y4ulu2598f\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2y4ulu2598f\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The <a href=\"https://www.arena.education/\">Alignment Research Engineer Accelerator</a> is a program that uses this curriculum. Some mentors on the <a href=\"https://www.serimats.org/\">SERI ML Alignment Theory Scholars Program</a> focus on empirical research.</li><li><strong>Learning about a sub-field of deep learning.</strong> In particular, we\u2019d suggest <i>natural language processing</i> (in particular transformers \u2014 see <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sNfkZFVm_xs\">this lecture</a> as a starting point) and <i>reinforcement learning</i> (take a look at <a href=\"https://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/\"><i>Pong from Pixels</i></a> by Andrej Karpathy, and OpenAI\u2019s <a href=\"https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/index.html\"><i>Spinning up in Deep RL</i></a>). Try to get to the point where you know about the most important recent advances.</li></ul><h2>Getting a job in theoretical AI safety research</h2><p>There are fewer jobs available in theoretical AI safety research, so it\u2019s harder to give concrete advice. Having a maths or theoretical computer science PhD isn\u2019t always necessary, but is fairly common among researchers in industry, and is pretty much <i>required</i> to be an academic.</p><p>If you do a PhD, ideally it\u2019d be in an area at least somewhat related to theoretical AI safety research. For example, it could be in probability theory as applied to AI, or in theoretical CS (look for researchers who publish in <a href=\"https://www.learningtheory.org/\">COLT</a> or <a href=\"http://ieee-focs.org/\">FOCS</a>).</p><p>Alternatively, one path is to become an empirical research lead before moving into theoretical research.</p><p>Compared to empirical research, you\u2019ll need to know relatively less about engineering, and relatively more about AI safety as a field.</p><p>Once you\u2019ve done <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/#learn-the-basics\">the basics</a>, one possible next step you could try is reading papers from a particular researcher, or on a particular topic, and summarising what you\u2019ve found.</p><p>You could also try spending some time (maybe 10\u2013100 hours) reading about a topic and then some more time (maybe another 10\u2013100 hours) trying to come up with some new ideas on that topic. For example, you could try coming up with proposals to solve the problem of <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/QEYWkRoCn4fZxXQAY/prizes-for-elk-proposals\">eliciting latent knowledge</a>. Alternatively, if you wanted to focus on the more mathematical side, you could try having a go at the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VQiy9Nl2VqdtzsJYUWhSuKSATwmXE_T3/view\">assignment at the end of this lecture by Michael Cohen, a grad student at the University of Oxford</a>.</p><p>If you want to enter academia, reading a <i>ton</i> of papers seems particularly important. Maybe try writing a survey paper on a certain topic in your spare time. It\u2019s a great way to master a topic, spark new ideas, spot gaps, and come up with research ideas. When applying to grad school or jobs, your paper is a fantastic way to show you love research so much you do it for fun.</p><p>There are some research programmes aimed at people new to the field, such as the <a href=\"https://www.serimats.org/\">SERI ML Alignment Theory Scholars Program</a>, to which you could apply.</p><p>Other ways to get more concrete experience include doing research internships, working as a research assistant, or doing a PhD, all of which we\u2019ve written about above, in the section on <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/ai-safety-researcher/#should-you-do-a-phd\">whether and how you can get into a PhD programme</a>.</p><p>One note is that a lot of people we talk to try to learn independently. This can be a great idea for some people, but is fairly tough for many, because there\u2019s substantially less structure and mentorship.</p><h2>Recommended organisations</h2><p>AI labs in industry that have empirical technical safety teams, or are focused entirely on safety:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/\">Anthropic</a> is an AI safety company working on building interpretable and safe AI systems.

No, the way he found out was somebody came back to visit him.</p><p>He had just woken up and was groggily opening up his emails when a skinny Indian man with a huge moustache he\u2019d never met before barged into his bedroom and slammed his laptop shut.</p><p>\u201cDon\u2019t open that!\u201d, the man cried.</p><p>Peter, who was not wearing pants and was only half awake, punched the man in the face. Or at least he tried. The man moved surprisingly fast out of the way.</p><p>\u201cOh yes, I forgot,\u201d he said. \u201cYou told me that your instincts were fight, not flight.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWho are you?\u201d exclaimed Peter, feeling bewildered and more than a little frightened. This man looked friendly, but he had just broken into his house and prevented him from reading his emails, two unforgivable crimes.</p><p>\u201cWhy, I\u2019m your prot\u00e9g\u00e9 from the future. Name\u2019s Kumar. Krishna Kumar.\u201d He held out his hand. Peter instinctively shook it. \u201cYou told me to tell you some things that would unambiguously confirm that, so you secretly like watching 4chan goo porn, and also, the winning lottery ticket that will be announced in 2 minutes is 2564 65443 7754. You can pull it up on your phone now. But whatever you do, don\u2019t look at your email. I know that that will drive you mad, but is it worth the risk of going against what Future You knows is the right call if you can\u2019t just wait 2 minutes to check your email? It\u2019s the utilitarian thing to do.\u201d</p><p>Peter felt as if he\u2019d just been told that his mom had died. Not checking emails for 2 minutes? What cruelty. If this was a practical joke, it had gone too far. Far too far.</p><p>So, he pulled out his phone and found out what the winning lottery number was. Sure enough, it was what Kumar had said. Kumar grinned at him.</p><p>\u201cFine, tell me what\u2019s going on? Why can\u2019t I check my emails?\u201d</p><p>Kumar\u2019s hitherto unstoppable grin fell. \u201cIt\u2019s the thing that causes you to give up.\u201d</p><p>Peter\u2019s curiosity burned. \u201cWhat is it?\u201d</p><p>\u201cI can\u2019t tell you. Not until I show you your two futures. One is the future I\u2019m from, and the other is the future that I\u2019m trying to prevent. Come with me.\u201d He held out his hand again and Peter took it.</p><p>He felt a lurch and suddenly he was in a mud hut. It could have been anywhere in India. A mother was just at the end of birth, screaming. Then the baby was out. The midwife handed her her newborn. It was ugly as fuck but you could tell as the woman cradled it in her arms that she had never felt such happiness and love before.</p><p>Kumar looked like he had multiple emotions fighting across his face. Softness but also sadness \u201cThat little baby\u2019s name is Sweta. She\u2019s the first who will die if you ever give up.\u201d</p><p>The father just came into the hut and his face lit up when he saw the child and mother. He came over to sit next to them, holding his hands out for his first born.</p><p>Peter was confused, \u201cI\u2019m not giving up,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy would you say that?\u201d</p><p>\u201cJust look\u201d said Kumar. Peter did and he couldn\u2019t imagine giving up on that child. Kumar put a hand on his shoulder and there was another jolt, but this time they were still in the same hut, but later in the season. It was monsooning outside and the floor was half covered in mud. The baby was much more plump and cute now, if it weren\u2019t for the angry red spots all over her body. She wasn\u2019t screaming, but that seemed to make it worse. The mother, so happy previously, looked like the life had been sucked out of her.</p><p>Kumar looked at Peter then said \u201cI won\u2019t make you see her die. But I will show you her from my future. The one Future You sent me from.\u201d</p><p>Another lurch. This time he\u2019s in a hospital waiting room. It looks to be developed world, but all of the signs are in Hindi, so he must be in India. A nurse walks by and Kumar nudges him \u201cThat\u2019s her. She becomes a nurse, an outstanding one.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t understand. I know this already. I know. Why are you showing me this?\u201d</p><p>\u201cBecause you told me that sometimes you forget. Sometimes you forget what\u2019s going on, and all you see is spreadsheet and bureaucracy. Sometimes you need to see again what you\u2019re doing it for. But that\u2019s just one example, and you told me you\u2019re not an anecdotes guy. So I\u2019m going to show you some stats.\u201d Peter perked up. \u201cBut I\u2019m going to show you the faces behind the stats.\u201d</p><p>Peter didn\u2019t know how long the Nights from Christmas Past session lasted. It could have been days, it could have been weeks. All he knew was it was overwhelming and it was heartbreaking and heartwarming and crushing and awe inspiring. So many lives. A single father raising a child after the woman passed away in childbirth, only to have his son get physically handicapped and unable to work or get married or support him old age. The man having to work two jobs in a mine and swimming in filth to support the child, only to have him die at the age of 12. A child who, had he lived, would have moved to Canada and sent remittances to his entire family, bringing an entire family out of poverty. A woman who passed away at birth who was sweet and caring. Who would have changed the societal expectations of women in her village as well been the emotional bedrock of her family.</p><p>The hundreds of thousands of heartbreaks, the beautiful and full lives.</p><p>All lost.</p><p>And that wasn\u2019t all. He started to see animals too. Animals going through immense and unbearable suffering, or living happy lives on a sanctuary. Bugs dying agonizing deaths.</p><p>So much, that when Kumar stopped, Peter just sat on the floor and put his head in his hands and cried. He cried for joy for their happiness and sadness for the immensity of so much sadness.</p><p>\u201cWhy? Why did you show me this? You said you\u2019d tell me after it\u2019s over. Is it over?\u201d</p><p>\u201cAlmost. That was just a representative sample, it wasn\u2019t all. But no. There\u2019s one last thing.\u201d Peter couldn\u2019t imagine handling anything more.</p><p>\u201cWhat?\u201d</p><p>\u201cYour email.\u201d</p><p>Suddenly they were back in his room, which seemed unbearably opulent to him now after being in so many huts, so much squalor.</p><p>He opened it.</p><p>It was an email from the IRS.</p><p>He didn\u2019t need to read the whole thing to know what Kumar was going to say \u201cThis is the day you lose your charity status because you used black font instead of charcoal grey font.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIn my future, a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 from a different timeline came and showed you what I showed you. You kept going. Those are all the lives you change. The suffering you prevent. The other, well, it\u2019s where you give up. To be fair, you\u2019re happy in both realities, but-\u201d</p><p>\u201cYou don\u2019t have to say anything more,\u201d Peter said. \u201cYou know what happens.\u201d</p><p>Kumar smiled. It wasn\u2019t the goofy grin from before. Seeing that much suffering makes it hard for that. But it was an authentic smile, a deep smile. One that comes from seeing suffering and then seeing great sacrifice.</p><p>\u201cWhat if I tell you that you don\u2019t get charity status for 5 years. That you-\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d Peter said. And he knew it, deep in his core. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. They matter.\u201d</p><p>And Kumar smiled and disappeared. But not before he whispered one last thing \u201cAlso, the winning lottery ticket number for tomorrow is 4687 5890 3939. Because future you isn\u2019t an idiot. I also recommend working on in vitro shrimp meat. Trust me. Or rather, trust future you.\u201d</p><p>The end</p><p><i>Written when I was running a vaccine charity in India and was feeling discouraged because of all the random bureaucracy.</i></p><p><i>If you liked this, you might also enjoy:</i></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tE7y8FZe7wSSzoRaS/the-parable-of-the-boy-who-cried-5-chance-of-wolf\">The Parable of the Boy Who Cried 5% Chance of Wolf</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mffMfysE4SntoARkj/four-reasons-i-find-ai-safety-emotionally-compelling\">Four reasons I find AI safety emotionally compelling</a></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gjcvSy2XmBw2Eobra/the-most-important-lesson-i-learned-after-ten-years-in-ea\">The most important lesson I learned after ten years in EA</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.katwoods.org/popular-posts.html\">My personal blog, which has a mix of EA and totally not EA posts</a></li></ul><p><i>Originally posted on my&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/Kat__Woods/status/1559486187617779713\"><i><u>Twitter</u></i></a><i><u>.</u></i></p>", "user": {"username": "katherinesavoie"}}, {"_id": "vrj7YLbjK4HMpnTni", "title": "Have your say on the Australian Government's AI Policy", "postedAt": "2023-07-17T11:02:32.430Z", "htmlBody": "<p>The Australian Government is asking what it can do the mitigate any potential risks from AI [see <a href=\"https://consult.industry.gov.au/supporting-responsible-ai\">consultation request</a>].</p><p>The Australian EA AI Governance group and <a href=\"https://www.goodancestors.org.au/policy\">Good Ancestors Policy</a> are preparing a submission to help mitigate the worst outcomes from AI [e.g., see <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/\">80,000 hours cause profile</a>].</p><p>At this event, we will assume most people are aware of those risks, and will instead be focusing on what government levers might help [e.g., <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/12-tentative-ideas-for-us-ai-policy/\">which of these apply in Australia</a>, or what might be similar alternatives].</p><p><strong>For those members of the community who want to make a submission to the consultation, we will provide advice, support, and feedback.</strong></p>", "user": {"username": "nsherb"}}, {"_id": "MrLeZJDqghqM5cTXC", "title": "Coaching matchmaking is now open: invest in community wellness by investing in yourself", "postedAt": "2023-07-17T11:17:55.096Z", "htmlBody": "<h1>Table of Contents &amp;

Why is \u2018fit\u2019 emphasized so much by TBCT? How could coaching matchmaking contribute to more coaching relationships with better fit?&nbsp;</i><br><br><ul><li>There\u2019s quite a bit of empirical support that having a great working relationship is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.apa.org/monitor/2019/11/ce-corner-sidebar\"><u>demonstrably effective</u></a> for achieving better outcomes.<br>We\u2019re betting that starting with high natural fit with a practitioner is crucial to the chances of achieving a healthy working alliance. Opening up a pool of (what we believe to be) high-quality options is our way of attempting to facilitate successful relationship fits for a larger number of people.&nbsp;<br><br>But it doesn\u2019t start and end with choosing from a pool of coaches. We hope to improve the fidelity of finding relationship fits by matching potential clients with a curated and tightly integrated set of coaches who work closely together. Ways we layer efforts to find fit are:&nbsp; i) factoring in client descriptions of need, ii) Tee\u2019s approximation of fit between the coaches and potential clients,, iii) the client\u2019s approximation of fit with the coach (before and upon meeting), and the iv) the coach\u2019s approximation of fit with the client (before and upon meeting), v) infrastructural support in the coach\u2019s efforts to cultivate fit. This includes intra- and inter-program referrals, which our coaches are encouraged to make where appropriate.&nbsp;<br><br>On top of that, practitioners working within TBCT are immersed in a program designed to nurture and develop their work with clients. For example, coaches solicit, receive and get support in interpreting multiple forms of feedback, including post-session reflection &amp; feedback forms, recorded sessions (with client permission), periodic reviews of post-session reflections and session recordings, client feedback debriefs, one-to-one sessions with Tee working through anonymized alliance challenges, and more.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><i>Do I need to identify as an EA or rationalist to receive this coaching?</i><br>&nbsp;<ul><li>You do not. I\u2019ve gotten the impression from all of my conversations within the cohort that the coaches would actually prefer to have a diverse set of people to work with.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><i>If I don\u2019t identify as an EA or rationalist, will coaches within your cohort overtly or subtly try to \u2018convert\u2019 me in any sense?&nbsp;</i><br><br><ul><li>Though I\u2019m not privy to all of the decisions and actions of coaches within the TBCT cohort, I strongly advise my coaches to not consciously engage in anything of that sort. In fact, not seeking to \u2018disprove\u2019 or \u2018argue someone out of\u2019 their personal ideological stances is a general methodological rule of thumb that this program takes seriously. That said, everyone holds a worldview that can (un)consciously influence how they serve others as a coach.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><h2>About TBCT and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BpWxOa-RCKuUG30NRYtgWYFAaj-lysk9fu_HBbF6EZ4/edit#heading=h.milrdcnhwij\"><u>where all of this could be headed</u></a></h2><ul><li><i>What are some ways that you would like to \u2018direct\u2019 or \u2018deploy\u2019 the TBCT infrastructure toward x-risk reduction?</i>&nbsp;<br><br><ul><li>I appreciate that given the shape of this post, a more detailed overall strategy would have been nice to provide. Nearly all of my efforts have been focused on the creation of this (hopefully) deployable resource, and as it begins looking increasingly promising, I\u2019ll start to sharpen more strategic pieces.&nbsp;<br><br>The directionality here is mostly oriented on AI risk, though not exclusively. First off, I\u2019m hoping this won\u2019t be necessary at all. My more realistic hope is that we will have the opportunity to run a handful of iterations of the program that arc toward TBCT having the ability to be useful once we get more clarity on what leading risks, pivotal events and/or escalation indicators (\u2018warning shots\u2019) are that we might be able to influence. (e.g. coaching folks working in AI policy to work sustainably and/or weather the necessary sprints to get advance policy outcomes)<br><br>By training up in a structured environment with clients of certain ideological persuasions, our coaches are already indirectly preparing to play a role in this should they want to. We already have programming directly and indirectly relevant to certain forms of existential beliefs and dread.&nbsp;<br><br>Depending on the perceived urgency of the situation, I could see various versions of i) attempting to get buy-in from current and former cohort coaches individually to contribute, ii) endeavoring to pivot cohorts-in-progress, and/or iii) constructing future iterations of the cohort to (almost) exclusively have coaches that intend to serve certain potential clients that are most relevant to how subsequent important events could play out. Perhaps TBCT could try to get buy-in from other coaching and therapy collectives and entities to do the same where it would make sense.

Given that numerous potential scenarios could play out, I\u2019m currently thinking of approaching this in buckets of different potential actions that correspond with how the development of our program arcs along certain timelines, allowing for tactical pivots where necessary. A lot of this obviously depends on how these risks are modeled, including questions of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vwLxd6hhFvPbvKmBH/yudkowsky-and-christiano-discuss-takeoff-speeds\"><u>discrete</u></a> vs.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CjW4axQDqLd2oDCGG/misconceptions-about-continuous-takeoff\"><u>continuous</u></a> takeoff, interpretation of \u2018<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LFNXiQuGrar3duBzJ/what-does-it-take-to-defend-the-world-against-out-of-control#3_3_1_Possible_response__1__We_ll_get_societal_resilience_by_responding_to_near_miss_warning_shots\"><u>warning shots</u></a>\u2019, and others. I\u2019m eager to be schooled here.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><i>Do you think that this program degrades the general standard of coaching within the communities that you intend to serve?&nbsp;</i><br><br><ul><li>There\u2019s a lot to say here, but I\u2019ll try to keep it concise. Were I not taking issue with the frame of this question, I still don\u2019t believe it \u2018degrades the standard\u2019 of coaching in these communities for a few reasons:<br><br><ul><li>Declaring stages of development&nbsp;\u2013&nbsp;distinguishing between established coaches and coaches-in-training does a lot of the heavy lifting in terms of calibrating quality expectations for all parties involved.</li><li>Training &amp; feedback apparatus \u2013&nbsp;not that established coaches \u2018in the wild\u2019 can\u2019t construct their own feedback apparatuses and take seriously self-directed study and training, but we should expect much higher variance with that. This cohort is incubating their practice within a multi-component&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.teebarnett.com/tbct#tbct-overview\"><u>training infrastructure</u></a>. I think this bodes well for their overall developmental arc, especially because TBCT attempts to retain the upsides of people figuring it out for themselves.&nbsp;<br><br>Should the program show clear signs of being important for developing coaches, and that those coaches are routinely causing good outcomes for clients, I\u2019ve been considering establishing a coaching collective with the current cohort, including some of the same coaches in future cohorts for extended training, and the like.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Curation \u2013 Insofar as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/aGTuQjvHrFqhgSuxZ/underinvestment-at-the-top-what-i-discovered-coaching-a\"><u>evidence about my coaching</u></a>, including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.teebarnett.com/all-testimonials\"><u>EA leader testimonials</u></a>, reflect on my overall fitness to run this project, and that these coaches were chosen as especially promising to collaborate with and learn from me out of a wider pool, they seem more likely to improve the standard of coaching than degrade it (especially considering the alternative of unsupervised self-starters).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Data Collection &amp; resulting accountability \u2013&nbsp;TBCT is designed to cultivate and support skilled coaches. Crucial for determining this is the data we collect about coaches across the cohort. We make determinations about in what ways and how much to support the development of coaches partly based on this data. For example, if we notice that a coach has a far lower client retention rate than the others, we\u2019ll look seriously into why that could be happening. Likewise, in the case where clients keep choosing to work with some coaches in the cohort rather than others, we\u2019ll look seriously into why that could be and see if there are growth edges to target.&nbsp;<br><i>&nbsp;</i></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><i>There\u2019s already a lot of coaches out there. How do you know you\u2019re not \u2018saturating the market,\u2019 especially within the communities you intend to serve?&nbsp;</i><br><br><ul><li>This is definitely a question I\u2019d like to explore (publicly) with others in other forums. But my short answer is \u2013 though I feel there are strong reason(s) to try this, TBCT is an experiment, and we\u2019ll see how it goes. This is one of the primary questions that this program is attempting to address. Demand for the matchmaking service at least, has been encouraging (we\u2019re at &gt; 60 applications).&nbsp;<br><br>From what I\u2019ve encountered, I\u2019m of the opinion that the more charged versions of this question are laced with insecurity about making a living, which I wouldn\u2019t want to dismiss out-of-hand either. But responding to this dispassionately as an open question, I feel there\u2019s reason to believe the demand for coaching isn\u2019t saturated, even if you consider the pool of demand to be somewhat fixed. I\u2019m also likely carrying very different views on the dynamic potential of the demand pool (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/tee.r.barnett/posts/pfbid0BrLtzCxRZWVRMKUfMqRK5b6KKSLw7GdPx1ZyaRjYYWbiC3LhdjrUwv6c9Cv7pJqol\"><u>my thoughts on</u></a> the potential for demand to grow based on surrounding norms and quality of available options).&nbsp;<br><br>My attempts to normalize coaching and other forms of personal support (for what I believe are good reasons) are, in fact, attempts to expand the demand pool. This can be attempted in many ways. Lowering barriers for testing out coaching and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.teebarnett.com/anythoughtson\"><u>offering informative perspectives</u></a> about coaching are my ways of doing this. I definitely appreciate the diversity of attempts by others to open up access, notably the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mentalhealthnavigator.co.uk/\"><u>EA Mental Health Navigator</u></a>. I believe our approach compliments directory-style resources.&nbsp;<br><br>An additional point that\u2019s tough to deliver \u2013 people typically have a limited intuitive understanding of demand for their services largely based on things related to i) their reach and ii) the quality of their service. Some people can do zero marketing and have more clients than they can handle. Some have to expend great resources and energy to build a funnel for clients and still can\u2019t seem to attract or retain enough. There\u2019s a lot of complexity to unpack here, but I feel this is important to point out.&nbsp;<br><br>Speaking directly to how this could affect existing coaches in the community, undoubtedly there will be situations where existing coaches go \u2018head-to-head\u2019 in competition with our cohort coaches. (I still think this is advantageous for potential clients on the whole). But in addition to my thoughts above regarding overall demand, we\u2019d also like to have an active external referral network. The strength of our recommendations couldn\u2019t be as strong because we don\u2019t work closely with external coaches, but nonetheless, I don\u2019t think that we could, nor would we want to, claim to be able to serve the coaching needs of entire communities. Some readers may be familiar with where I\u2019ve stood on community building centralization throughout my career. (We might be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DdSszj5NXk45MhQoq/decision-making-and-decentralisation-in-ea\"><u>embarking on a new era</u></a> here).<br><br>If you\u2019re an existing coach, please feel free to fill out&nbsp;<a href=\"https://zs7rg3fjxon.typeform.com/to/nQHWsTpR\"><u>this brief form</u></a> if you\u2019d like to be considered for our external referral network. We\u2019ll do our best to minimize the overhead of collaboration. It\u2019s likely that we\u2019ll request to see feedback from referred clients after some number of sessions in order to calibrate our confidence regarding the referral. I\u2019ve already arranged several out-of-cohort referrals to well-known EA coaches after downshifting my caseload to take on TBCT, and in the case of special requests I\u2019ve received, such as a public speaking coach.&nbsp;<br><br>And finally, I could certainly be wrong here. In my answers to thoughts above, I point out that observing how it goes with a collective of coaches is a decent, albeit not conclusive, vantage point for assessing overall demand. It could eventually become crystal clear that there isn\u2019t enough demand (either for coaches as part of this collective in general).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li><i>What would you need to see to be convinced that your coaching matchmaking is not worth pursuing?&nbsp;</i><br><br><ul><li>Here are a handful of reasons how I could conclude that this doesn\u2019t make sense. You\u2019ll notice there\u2019s several and that each of them stand a good chance of being true. Nonetheless, I believe the potential of success to be likely enough, and information value to be high enough, to feel excited about this experiment.&nbsp;<br><br><ul><li>Lack of enthusiasm and demand \u2013 reflected in matchmaking application numbers, intake call conversions (where too low a number of introductory calls turn into coaching relationships), and low client retention. A telling set of indicators here resides in questions regarding whether coaches feel convinced they can make a living from this, all things considered.&nbsp;</li><li>Lack of outcome-oriented successes \u2013 if we see too little evidence that the coaching itself isn\u2019t useful for clients. Our expectations regarding this will increase as the cohort coaches gain more experience, where staking too much expectation to outcomes in the early days of training could be counterproductive. We\u2019d find evidence in this from client feedback, coach reflections, and client retention numbers.&nbsp;</li><li>How the system functions distorts natural fit dynamics \u2013&nbsp;it could be that something about how the matchmaking system metabolizes the personal judgements of Tee, cohort coaches and/or potential clients actually inhibits good matchmaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Self-sorting based on distant impressions is really how fit works \u2013 it could be that fit test/intake calls are simply ways for clients to confirm or make themselves feel better about decisions they\u2019ve already made about working with practitioners from afar. TBCT might be underweighting just how much of a filtering effect that information transmitted online has before a meeting ever takes place. We\u2019d see hints of this if we observe that a number of potential clients simply choose who they request, or who they\u2019ve done a single fit call with.&nbsp;</li><li>Fit testing gets increasingly normalized \u2013&nbsp;we\u2019ve already seen some hints that even suggesting the frame of matchmaking can inspire those looking for coaching to take on personal initiative to matchmake for themselves. This could pull away from the demand of the program, but ultimately seems positive to contribute to norms of that sort. My personal position here is that engaging in these personal support relationships (coaching, therapy) could be so pivotal to how one\u2019s life goes that comparatively more time searching, researching and test fitting with practitioners is warranted.</li><li>Have other suggestions for this?

Our particular portfolio prioritizes cultivating subjective sophistication as a coach. In other words, a training program for the refinement of the coach\u2019s own sensemaking compass, and hopefully in turn, the skill and wisdom to guide others in refining their compasses.<br><br>It\u2019s a program that allows for coaches to integrate their preferred coaching methods, modalities, tools and intentions in a way that is ultimately intended to be effective when delivered to others. The turn from \u2018grow in your preferred direction\u2019 to \u2018make it effective\u2019 implies the presence of a supportive but also challenging process that intends to cause coaches to forge their own personal synthesis with their craft.&nbsp;<br><br>This style of approach reflects the belief that Tee is well-suited to construct this infrastructure and facilitate developmental progress for coaches on this path, in contrast to more authoritative positioning that might cut against integrating a plurality of traditions, paradigms, modalities, methods, approaches and intentions.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnrwcqxb6whis\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefrwcqxb6whis\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>The exact rate within that range will vary as a matter of agreement between the supervised coach and client.

This piece is part of this process and is seeking to collect the reasons why having bad or non-existing space governance might be very harmful.&nbsp;</p><p>The distinction between near- and long-term risks is fuzzy. I am differentiating between the risks we face in the next few centuries and the risks which will be faced in the very long-run future.&nbsp;</p><p>The individual risks are not fully disjunctive. They should be viewed as pointers in the direction of a risk rather than fully distinct buckets.&nbsp;</p><p>Since long-termist space governance is a very young field, it\u2019s not clear that this typology will stand the test of time. This post is meant to give us more clarity now to more effectively conduct the relevant research.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Near Term</h2><h3>Unsustainability</h3><p>Space Expansion could be conducted in a way that later proves unsustainable. The resources in the earth\u2019s immediate vicinity are overexploited early and their absence makes space expansion harder than it otherwise would be. This could set back the project of space expansion for significant amounts of time.&nbsp;</p><p>Examples of resources in near-Earth space which could be depleted include the limited number of comets that come close to earth and the ice on the lunar poles. Intensive utilization of Earth Orbit might lead to accidents causing Kessler Syndrome, which would be costly to clean up. Particularly valuable orbits (GEO/SSO/ISS zone) could also become crowded.&nbsp;</p><p>We believe that risks in this category are a lot less important than the other ones.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Negative Impact on Governance on Earth&nbsp;</h3><p>Even before significant parts of human civilization resides in space, space expansion has the potential to impact the geopolitical balance on earth in a negative way.&nbsp;</p><p>A malevolent actor that is in a subordinate military position on earth could use strategic investment in space capabilities as a way to put themselves in a superior position. As satellite capabilities become more and more crucial to modern war, an actor could make strategic and focussed investments in that area.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In general the politics of space are a potentially controversial issue. A distribution of benefits that are perceived as 'unfair' could introduce political instability. Since there is no history of humanity distributing resources from space and violence has historically been associated with the conquest of new frontiers, this is a risk not to be neglected. Disagreement about it could make cooperation on other existential risk relevant issues.</p><h3><br>Increasing Existential Risk</h3><p>As more human activity shifts off earth, it may get harder to regulate, since humanity has little experience with space governance and the proper regulatory regime has yet to be set up. This means that the governance of a variety of dangerous technologies gets harder. So we can expect space expansion to increase all risks that require global governance.</p><p>We may expect Space Expansion to accelerate the deployment of AI systems, as they are more important in space than on earth. This is because space is quite inhospitable to humans and ensuring they are protected at all times while executing tasks can be expected to be quite expensive. Making AI systems harder to regulate and increasing humanity\u2019s reliance on them might increase the risk of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/s/dxCZoP3TDaB8Acwjo/p/HBxe6wdjxK239zajf\"><u>\"Going out with a whimper\"</u></a> described by Paul Christiano.&nbsp;</p><p>As development of the relevant technologies proceeds, more and more actors are going to have access to space and may be able to use it to do harm. One example is the deliberate diversion of asteroids towards earth. As Carl Sagan noted, any method capable of deflecting an asteroid away from earth could also be used by malevolent actors to steer an asteroid towards it.&nbsp;</p><p>For more details on this topic I recommend&nbsp;<a href=\"https://spacefuturesinitiative.org/research-papers/risks-frameworks-futures/\"><u>this</u></a> paper by Carson Ezell.&nbsp;</p><h2>Long Term</h2><h3>Suboptimal Resource Use</h3><p>Whatever goals humanity may have in the future, almost everything we may want to accomplish is limited by the amount of matter in the universe and the physical and cosmological laws governing it. For some moral views, the amount of energy we can utilize is directly proportional to the amount of value we can create. If space expansion is done in a chaotic, uncoordinated way, resources may be wasted, causing us to fall short of our potential.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Harmful Irreversible Measures</h3><p>On the current view of humanity's possible futures there are things ahead that - once they are executed - might only be reversible at very high cost. Examples are accidental biological contamination, deliberate panspermia, or space expansion via automated self-replicating probes. Those things could later prove suboptimal or even immoral upon reflection.&nbsp;</p><p>Any future Space Governance Framework should ensure that such actions are alway preceded by a long period of reflection or are executed in a more reversible manner. We can expect this to be a hard challenge, since many of the examples listed above are subject to unilateral action and a lot of coordination or enforcement might be needed to avoid them.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Using Control over Space to enforce Totalitarianism</h3><p>On Earth it has so far been impossible for a single actor to establish control over the entire planet. Totalitarian regimes were always limited to a fraction of the Earth\u2019s surface. If humanity establishes more control over outer space or human life even plays out in space primarily, the obstacles we have seen on earth thus far may no longer apply.&nbsp;</p><p>Establishing total control over space will likely give an actor a decisive advantage over any great power limited to earth. From there it might be possible to establish a space governance framework that ensures totalitarian power for a long period of time.&nbsp;</p><p>This risk is different from the claim that moving the political playing field from earth to space increases the risk for all encompassing totalitarianism - the opposite might be the case. But space expansion could present one additional opportunity for it.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Permanent War&nbsp;</h3><p>A different scenario we should try to steer away from is one where space is inhabited by many different actors in permanent military confrontation. Instability could come from lack of trust due to the lack of communication over long distances or an OD Balance heavily favoring the offense and strongly pushing actors towards a first strike.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Dangerous Competition Dynamics</h3><p>A politically unstable governance order could also lead to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/\"><u>competition dynamics</u></a>.</p><p>For instance, if there is no credible way of ensuring peaceful coexistence, different coalitions may be forced to allocate most of their resources to defense instead of ensuring a flourishing civilization.</p><p>Another example: different actors expend lots of resources to increase their speed of expansion, as described by Robin Hanson in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/filluniv.pdf\"><u>\u201cBurning the Cosmic Commons\u201d</u></a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Inability to coordinate on Large Scale Projects</h3><p>In general we want to be able to coordinate on important large projects. One example of a large scale project is aestivation - the idea that civilization should delay most computation until the average temperature of the universe is lower, allowing for more efficiency.&nbsp;</p><p>Another example could be the moving of galaxies into so-called hyperclusters, which could counteract the increase of the distances between them due to the expansion of the universe.</p><p>Inability to coordinate on such projects could lead to wasted resources and leave us unable to reach the most desired end states of space expansion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><h3>Inability to Enforce Rules</h3><p>While we currently can\u2019t be sure how an optimal governance order beyond earth should look, we know that we want it to be able to enforce certain rules over all inhabited parts of the universe. We want to stop malevolent actors from deliberately or instrumentally producing a lot of suffering - in physical as well as digital form. We might also want to ban actors from unilaterally moving stars and galaxies as well as wasting a lot of energy in general. Actors should also launch not be able to launch dangerous self-replicating devices or deliberately or accidentally produce vacuum decay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Suffering Risks</h3><p>Space expansion allows for the existence of many more sentient beings than would be possible on earth - in physical and potentially in digital form. This means space expansion can enable a lot of good, but also contains the risk of astronomical suffering.&nbsp;</p><p>Humanity may choose to terraform and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MKmowJNCeJCaitK3x/wild-animal-welfare-in-the-far-future\"><u>spread wildlife</u></a> to other planets or wildlife may be part of artificial settlements.&nbsp;</p><p>Digital beings might exist for a variety of purposes and for reasons of entertainment, economic productivity or information gain they&nbsp;<a href=\"https://centerforreducingsuffering.org/research/a-typology-of-s-risks/#Incidental_s-risks\"><u>may experience a lot of suffering</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>If it is possible to create universes in a laboratory, this could also constitute an s-risk under certain circumstances.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><h3>Bad Response to Extraterrestrial Intelligence</h3><p>There is a sufficiently large chance that in the process of expanding to other stars and galaxy humanity\u2019s descendants might encounter ETI. This would be an outcome that is very hard to plan for and entails the potential for catastrophic outcomes.&nbsp;</p><p>The worst outcome is probably a very destructive war, but scenarios in which one of the parties quickly defeats and forces its preference upon the other could be very bad.&nbsp;</p><p>Ideally the way space expansion is conducted and the governance framework would be set up in a way to minimize the chance of a very bad outcome. It should also entail the flexibility to arrange for the best outcome given the specific conditions of the encounter.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Unknown Unknowns</h3><p>Then there could still be risks that we don\u2019t have the ability to fully grasp yet. A good space governance framework should be able to respond appropriately to such unknown unknowns.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>This is one of the pieces written as part of the&nbsp;<strong>CHERI Summer Research Program 2022</strong>.

How are the Basel Accords implemented today?</u></strong></a></h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bis.org/bcbs/index.htm\"><u>The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision</u></a> (BCBS) is one of several<a href=\"https://www.bis.org/stability.htm\"><u> committees of the Bank for International Settlements</u></a> (formed of the central banks of (now)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bis.org/about/member_cb.htm?m=2601\"><u>63 central banks and monetary authorities</u></a>). Its mandate is concerned with developing global regulatory standards for banks. It was formed in 1930 and comprises<a href=\"https://www.bis.org/bcbs/membership.htm\"><u> 45 voluntary members from 28 jurisdictions</u></a>.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.bis.org/bcbs/organ_and_gov.htm\"><u>The structure of BCBS&nbsp;</u></a>comprises a chair that governs the activity of the Basel Committee, standing groups with specialised functions, and a Secretariat that provides administrative and analytical support to the Committee and its numerous working groups. The Secretariat also organises the drafting of standards. The BCBS reports to the Group of Central Bank Governors and Heads of Supervision (GHOS), which oversees and endorses major BCBS decisions.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.bis.org/about/basel_process.htm\"><u>Its policy development is a messy process</u></a> where many members of the BCBS itself consult widely with stakeholders for years to come to a consensus on priorities and standards. This consultation is extremely wide-ranging: involving regular meetings; policy proposals sought from non-members; working groups and task forces that take on specific research questions and aspects of standard development; regular communication with governments and central banks, and comments from the public. Consensus-forming is the central function of the Basel Committee: it maintains a flexible structure and process, ascertaining priorities and next steps as it continues to consult with its member states and its wider set of stakeholders, culminating in the publication of reports, updates to standards, and new standards when needed.&nbsp;</li><li>Basel members agree to adopt the Basel Accords, which they typically do, given all members are closely involved in developing standards. However, the Basel Accords have been adopted in over 100 jurisdictions (albeit to varying degrees of compliance) and even often applied to domestic banks, given it is now the norm in international financial regulation.</li><li>Basel members are responsible for implementing the Basel Accords, usually done via national legislation. States are responsible for enforcement (e.g. whether audits are held).&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Z8aTh-G1rrYtBfV1PDRk2RqMl30wy88RiaqBPwY8gY/edit#heading=h.8ake7ynmerhy\"><strong><u>3. Why and how did the Basel Accords emerge?</u></strong></a></h3><ul><li>Efforts to increase globalisation after World War II, yet consciousness about the economic risks involved (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_banking_crises\"><u>particularly given several banking crises had already occurred</u></a>) led to increased international trade and several international organisations that attempted to ensure international stability - namely the<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_of_Ten_(IMF)\"><strong><u>IMF G10</u></strong></a> and the<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Economic_Community#:~:text=The%20European%20Economic%20Community%20(EEC,formed%20European%20Union%20in%201993.\"><strong><u>European Economic Community</u></strong></a>.&nbsp;</li><li>International trade between Europe and the US led to large amounts of US dollars held in foreign accounts (the \u2018Eurodollar\u2019), and this market caused concern amongst central bankers and the aforementioned institutions. The IMF initially created the&nbsp;<strong>Euro-currency Standing Committee</strong> in April 1971, and a collection of central bankers at EEC organisations formed the informal&nbsp;<strong>Groupe de Contact&nbsp;</strong>in 1972 to discuss international regulation.</li><li>In 1973, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yom_Kippur_War\"><u>Yom Kippur War</u></a> increased oil prices and spurred central banks to figure out how to recycle the flow of funds into their economies. In 1974,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.citeco.fr/10000-years-history-economics/contemporary-world/collapse-of-the-herstatt-bank-in-germany-and-creation-of-the-basel-committee\"><u>Bankhaus Herstatt was a German bank that collapsed</u></a> due to making bad bets on the US dollar, and this led to large US losses due to regulatory inconsistencies resulting in US banks not receiving back dollars for Deutschmark they had sold to Bankhaus Herstatt. The collapse of Bakhaus Herstatt triggered awareness of a need for greater international regulation. Through the&nbsp;<strong>Bank for International Settlements</strong>, individuals at the Euro-currency Standing Committee, Groupe de Contact, and central banks formed the&nbsp;<strong>Basel Committee on Banking Standards</strong>, consisting of the G10 countries.</li><li>The Basel Committee began with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs00a.htm\"><u>principles for bank supervision</u></a>. But increased global interest in capital adequacy and pressure from the US (and to a lesser extent the UK) for regulatory standardisation, particularly due to fears of Japanese banks remaining more profitable by having more lax capital adequacy standards, led to the emergence of Basel I - a capital adequacy standard adopted by the member states of the Basel Committee.</li><li>Basel II emerged in 2004 after a call for a new standard in 1999, given Basel I was insufficient. Basel III emerged in 2010 after the financial crisis, also resulting in an expansion in membership and more widespread adoption.</li></ul><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Z8aTh-G1rrYtBfV1PDRk2RqMl30wy88RiaqBPwY8gY/edit#heading=h.x66izxm9aw83\"><strong><u>4.

key</u></strong></a><strong>:</strong> continuous consensus-forming, relationship-building, and widespread consultation is the cornerstone of how the Basel Accords became an international norm of financial regulation, even given the contestability of financial regulation.</li><li><a

process</u></strong></a><strong>:&nbsp;</strong>the Basel Committee maintain regular lines of communication to stay highly sensitive to shifting incentives, thinking, and priorities.</li><li><a

I never got a reply. On the other hand, the two friends I discussed it with both thought it was worth telling others about (even though one was skeptical).</p><p>Maybe it's a dumb idea, but given the upside potential if it's not, I think I should share it again, this time publicly: <strong>short-selling stocks likely to lose to A(G)I</strong>. For example, the stock of Chegg, a homework cheating site, <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/02/chegg-drops-more-than-40percent-after-saying-chatgpt-is-killing-its-business.html\">dropped ~45%</a> after a quarterly report stated it was losing signups to ChatGPT. I think this wouldn't have been hard to predict in advance.</p><p>Here's how I argued for this idea in the email.</p><blockquote><p>It seems that the market, right now, is largely unaware of the impact AI will have (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8c7LycgtkypkgYjZx/agi-and-the-emh-markets-are-not-expecting-aligned-or?commentId=W5AXtcM89ykGcp4GX\">this comment</a> on 'AGI and the EMH' seems true to me). If so, given many EAs have inside-views of AI's trajectory, it seems to me like looking for and shorting stocks likely to rapidly decrease in value due to outcompetition by AI could be a really effective strategy. For example, if starting with $1m, it would only take successfully predicting 19 similar drops to reach above $1b (but even predicting 1 seems significant, compared to normal return rates). Moreover, it seems a failed prediction doesn't incur much loss in comparison, e.g if a stock's value doesn't change or only shifts a little, then on average one stays equal on failed predictions.</p><p>[...] I'm a little hesitant to post this idea publicly, because I don't really have a presence in the EA community yet, but I think that if this idea seems good to you there should definitely be some coordinated effort among EAs to fund an attempt at this. (Another reason is that I'm not sure if it might be slightly infohazardous, since I'd guess there's only some years remaining before the market catches up, and posting publicly could help it catch up sooner.)</p><p>[...] Even if it only had a 10% chance of success, the expected gain/loss ratio would probably be worth attempting it still.</p></blockquote><p>Here's another argument for this: most of us probably expect AI to have a large economic impact in the coming years. One easy-to-think-of method to exploit this -- creating an AI-based company -- is still hard, because you still need to outcompete other companies, including ones created by others attempting to do the same thing, and including larger companies modifying themselves to integrate AI. In contrast, short-selling only requires successfully predicting <i>areas</i> where AI will win out, and identifying non-AI companies in those areas, especially ones which don't seem they'll integrate AI, or which don't seem they'd have an advantage against other AI companies if they did (or against existing AIs per se, in chegg's case).</p><p>Please discuss, bring this up with knowledgeable friends, etc, since this <i>could</i> be important.</p><p>I'll continue looking for other creative actions, as well. If I do come up with others, I'll try not to make the same mistake of not sharing it with the right audience initially (in this case, I probably should have posted it publicly sooner).</p><p>(A note for those who might want to cite the EMH: the EA-forum post <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8c7LycgtkypkgYjZx/agi-and-the-emh-markets-are-not-expecting-aligned-or\">AGI and the EMH: markets are not expecting aligned&nbsp;or unaligned AI in the next 30 years</a> and its comments have some good discussion)</p>", "user": {"username": "kuira"}}, {"_id": "NobC6i9xoE3mZgKYa", "title": "Misconceptions About Radical Lifespan Extension", "postedAt": "2023-07-16T08:50:11.703Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Below are five common objections to human immortality with my responses to each of them.</p><p><i><strong>#1: \u201cOld people don\u2019t change their minds.\u201d</strong></i></p><p>Elon Musk famously espouses this objection against immortality.

Progress is not inevitable \u201cone funeral at a time\u201d. Society was static for hundreds of thousands of years before the Enlightenment. And in those days, humans used to live far shorter lives than today. The uneventful period before the Enlightenment was a result of irrational memes ingrained in society\u2019s culture. These memes inhibited questioning what was known and survived by disabling the critical faculties of people that are responsible for advancing our knowledge.</p><p>Society getting static is a real concern.

Look at how the natural world has been pruned and modified.\u201d</p><p>Without technology, many parts of the Earth (and beyond!) would be uninhabitable for us. Mother Nature is far more threatening than she is benevolent. People will go on turning useless matter into something that can be utilized for their productive purposes. And since space is practically infinite, this transformation of matter into resources can go on indefinitely. People are the solution, not the problem.</p><p><i><strong>#3: \u201cIt is unnatural to live forever.\u201d</strong></i></p><p>False.

That is how we came to the top of the food chain. It is almost unnatural for us not to go against\u2014primarily to advance\u2014our inborn capabilities or instincts.</p><p>And you know what else is natural? Earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, tsunamis, floods, droughts, asteroid impacts, and many more threats to all life on Earth. \u201cNatural\u201d does not mean good.</p><p>Death is not a part of life. It is the end of it. There is nothing good about death. Parochially, it can be caused by this or that disease. But the deeper explanation for death is always ignorance. No fundamental law requires it. We should treat it just as it is: another problem to be solved.</p><p><i><strong>#4: \u201cWe\u2019ll all run out of things to do and life will get meaningless without death.\u201d</strong></i></p><p>Contemplating their mortality seldom pushes people to achieve things they want to achieve. People do things to improve their lives, and the life of an immortal can improve indefinitely. There is always more work to be done, more space to be transformed, and a better world to aim towards.</p><p>For some, infinity is a bit hard to comprehend. It can help to reframe the question \u201cDo you want to live forever?\u201d to \u201cDo you want to live tomorrow?\u201d Most people do. Most people don\u2019t have plans to die. If they\u2019re feeling physically and mentally healthy, most people would say yes to tomorrow.</p><p>Creativity knows no bounds. Our knowledge can keep on growing deeper and broader in all fields without limit. As long as this is true, life need not get boring, the fun need never stop. As Leonardo da Vinci, someone who lived up to the very end of his life like a child said, \u201cLearning never exhausts the mind.\u201d</p><p><i><strong>#5: \u201cOnly the rich will be able to afford to live forever causing greater inequality.\u201d</strong></i></p><p>Initially, it is true that only the rich will be able to access the metaphorical pill to immortality. But this doesn\u2019t mean we shouldn\u2019t work on it! Almost any new revolutionary product or technology has high unit cost before it can be made affordable for the masses.&nbsp;</p><p>And it eventually always <i>is</i> made affordable for the masses. The time period depends on how fast we innovate. But indeed, as John F. Kennedy allegedly said about capitalism, \u201cA rising tide lifts all boats.\u201d</p><p>In the pre-modern, poor world <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy\">life expectancy was around 30 years</a> in all regions of the world.&nbsp;Even the richest would have to see their children die before the age of five, and they wouldn\u2019t live long either. Since then, the world has witnessed a rise in income inequality yet in every world region people today can expect to live more than <i>twice</i> as long compared to the 18th century. Not only do people live longer but their lives are arguably better in every way today than 300 years ago.</p>", "user": {"username": "Arjun Khemani"}}, {"_id": "MxnCf9qBTFygKnziF", "title": "Embracing the automated future", "postedAt": "2023-07-16T08:47:55.894Z", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>\u201cAt one of our dinners, Milton (Friedman) recalled traveling to an Asian country in the 1960s and visiting a worksite where a new canal was being built.

Being employed for its own sake is seldom our aim. We labor to reap its fruits like food, clothing, and shelter; or to satisfy other physical and spiritual desires. One of the intrinsic qualities of being human is the urge to be relieved of burdensome effort and freed to pursue more desirable objectives. This urge drives us to invent tools and machines that free us to address better problems.</p><p>If automation caused unemployment, then considering all the technological advancements over the past few centuries, nearly everyone would be unemployed by now. Clearly, this is not the case. It will never be the case if the marketplace is allowed to function freely, subject to the laws of supply and demand.</p><p>Automation raises the productivity of our time, raising the standard of living for all. I hope future people (me included) will look at the way we live life today the same way we look at how primitive hunter-gatherers lived in the past: with horror.</p><p>Ask anyone above 50 years about their youth, and they will tell you how harder things were \u201cback in the day\u201d. In the future, we will look at automated tasks in the same spirit of appreciation. The millions of jobs that become redundant will not evoke negative sentiments. We will instead appreciate the liberation from those repetitive and painful tasks. Of course, there will always be people who engage in fearmongering and argue for irrational policies and taxation on innovation.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefajoj98kuc56\"><sup><a href=\"#fnajoj98kuc56\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;But it is crucial to recognize that their arguments are fundamentally misguided; and will consistently be refuted.</p><p>The more we automate with programs and machines, the more we are freed to do that which is uniquely human: to think. Automation is not a substitute for humans but a complement. It should not be feared or taxed but embraced. People will never become redundant because explanatory creativity can never be automated. In principle, one could program it, but that would create another person, not an automaton.

Each borough has its own character, as do the individual neighborhoods within the boroughs, but they are all part of New York City and are served by a united city government and public transit system. Manhattan is at the heart of the city, and is what most people think of when they think of New York City.</li><li>There are also several areas immediately outside of the city that are very accessible by public transit, such as Jersey City, Hoboken, and New Jersey\u2019s suburbs, suburbs on Long Island (Nassau and Suffolk Counties), parts of the state of Connecticut, and suburbs in upstate New York (ie. Westchester, Putnam, and Dutchess Counties).</li><li>Each of these areas is made up of many smaller neighborhoods, which vary dramatically in demographics, building styles, and activities.</li><li>The EA community in NYC is very spread-out, and includes people in all of these areas and sometimes beyond.&nbsp;</li><li>Of the five boroughs, Manhattan is the most densely populated, generally has the best accessibility, and usually has the most going on during the day (including anything from university research and co-working to tourism and EA NYC events). It will typically be the most expensive place to stay.</li><li>Brooklyn (especially northwestern Brooklyn closer to Manhattan) and Queens (especially southwestern Queens closer to Manhattan) are also pretty centrally located and would allow access to co-working from cafes/libraries, more residential neighborhoods where some community members live, as well as more recreational options like dancing, performances, and bars.</li><li>New Jersey (especially eastern New Jersey closer to Manhattan) can also provide more affordable living and decent access to Manhattan.</li><li>Staten Island and the Bronx: EA NYC usually sees less representation from these boroughs, likely due to the greater geographical distance from events.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>A quick note on safety</h3><ul><li>Most New Yorkers consider the city very safe (to the point that our team almost forgot to mention this), and the data supports this.<ul><li>Overall, New York is a very safe city (despite what others would have you believe based on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crime_in_New_York_City#/media/File:MURDERS_IN_NEW_YORK_CITY_BY_YEAR.png\"><u>misconceptions rooted from 40 years ago</u></a>).

For visitors with less urban experience, any city may be a shock. And while New York is quite safe by US standards, it may not be as safe as some European or East Asian cities to which some visitors are accustomed. Most of this difference is attributable to crime in low-income areas unlikely to be seen by tourists, but some minor extra precautions could be still be advisable.<ul><li>While we\u2019re not positioned to prevent you from any risk when you visit, we think&nbsp;<a href=\"https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/fodors/top/features/travel/destinations/unitedstates/newyork/newyorkcity/fdrs_feat_111_8.html?n=Top%252FFeatures%252FTravel%252FDestinations%252FUnited%2520States%252FNew%2520York%252FNew%2520York%2520City\"><u>this guide</u></a> has some decent tips in case you would like to review something.

But for starters, we\u2019ve included some tips below.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Yq6yKgBtaMgkgyetm/gcc4yzlzszmkytdlybfd\"></p><p><strong>Above: NYC harbor and skyline at dusk</strong></p><h2><br>Attractions</h2><p>When in doubt, you can always check&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/\"><u>Atlas Obscura</u></a>. For now, you can find some of our team\u2019s recommendations below.</p><h2>Nature</h2><ul><li>Walks<ul><li>Central Park (Manhattan) is&nbsp;<i>not</i> overrated. It\u2019s a beautiful park that often allows guests to forget they\u2019re in a city. The lower park (say, below 79th street) is often pretty busy, but worth the visit. You can rent boats, find fields for picnics/sports, listen to random street performances, enjoy the park\u2019s hidden jewels, and simply appreciate the park\u2019s nature. As you go more north in the park it tends to get less busy, though the nature and sights are still plenty!</li><li>Prospect Park (Brooklyn) is another massive park featuring similar benefits to Central Park. If you\u2019re staying in Brooklyn or prefer a more natural forest over designed landscape, you should check it out (potentially instead of Central Park depending on how long you\u2019re staying for).</li><li>Other highlights:<ul><li>Brooklyn Bridge (Between Brooklyn and Manhattan)</li><li>The High Line (Manhattan)</li><li>Battery Park City Esplanade (Manhattan)</li><li>You can always look up more walks&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alltrails.com/\"><u>here</u></a>!</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Smaller Parks:<ul><li>Central Park and Prospect Park, of course, as mentioned above</li><li>Bryant Park (Manhattan) is very centrally located in midtown, right next to the main branch of the NY Public Library (also famous) and Grand Central Terminal (also famous).</li><li>Washington Square Park (Manhattan) features an iconic arch, lies in the beautiful Greenwich Village, and is immediately adjacent to NYU.</li><li>Union Square (Manhattan) is particularly fun to visit in the summer when vendors line the park selling local produce.</li><li>Many more! Many local parks in Manhattan are great for people watching. Depending on your location, some other parks in Brooklyn and Queens may or may not be so nice!</li><li>Also check out the recommendations for sunset points below - those are all great parks with the added bonus of being especially good at sunset!</li></ul></li><li>Spots to Watch the Sunset<ul><li>Queens<ul><li>Astoria Park</li><li>Gantry Plaza State Park</li></ul></li><li>Brooklyn<ul><li>Domino Park</li><li>Brooklyn Bridge Park</li></ul></li><li>Manhattan<ul><li>The Battery / Battery Park City Esplanade</li><li>Hudson River Greenway</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Beaches<ul><li>Jacob Riis Park is an excellent combination of accessibility and \u201cbeachiness.\u201d Facing the Atlantic Ocean, the beach allows guests to do all the beachy things: surf, swim, and sunbathe. You can drive, bike, or take the Q35 bus to get there.</li><li>Coney Island is famous for its boardwalk and cultural history. While it\u2019s a bit more sheltered from the ocean, it\u2019s pretty accessible - all you have to do is take the F train all the way to the end!</li><li>There are other popular beaches farther out on Long Island, as well as miscellaneous smaller beaches as you head upstate in NY!</li></ul></li></ul><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>Food</h2><ul><li>Here are just a few local favorites:<ul><li><a href=\"https://beyondsushi.com/\"><u>Beyond Sushi</u></a> (Various, Manhattan)</li><li><a href=\"https://plantbarnyc.com\"><u>Plant Bar</u></a> (Midtown, Manhattan)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.spicymoonnyc.com\"><u>Spicy Moon</u></a> (Greenwich Village, Manhattan)</li><li><a href=\"https://order.sweetgreen.com/?utm_source=google_listing&amp;utm_medium=yext&amp;utm_campaign=visit_main_website_CTA&amp;y_source=1_MjYyMTY3Mi03MTUtbG9jYXRpb24ud2Vic2l0ZQ%3D%3D\"><u>SweetGreen</u></a> (Various, Manhattan)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.veganbodhi.com/\"><u>Bodhi Dim Sum</u></a> (Chinatown, Manhattan)&nbsp;<ul><li>Note:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vSgAMZCpJoYsNxvD4/announcing-the-april-1st-purchase-of-bodhi-kosher-vegetarian\"><u>we do NOT own this restaurant</u></a></li></ul></li><li><a href=\"http://v\"><u>Screamer\u2019s Pizzeria</u></a> (Multiple, Brooklyn)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.overthrowhospitality.com/venues/avantgarden\"><u>Avant Garden</u></a> [fancier] (East Village, Manhattan)</li></ul></li><li>See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happycow.net/searchmap?s=3&amp;location=new+york+city&amp;filters=vegan&amp;metric=mi&amp;limit=81&amp;order=price&amp;lat=40.738464202120426&amp;lng=-73.9601284506987&amp;zoom=13&amp;page=1&amp;bb=40.69560706756009%2C-74.0205532553862%2C40.78132133668076%2C-73.8997036460112&amp;radius=0\"><u>HappyCow.net</u></a> for additional recommendations based on your location as well as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vegan-nyc/id1185047211\"><u>Vegan NYC</u></a> app for New York highlights!</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Museums</h2><ul><li>The American Museum of Natural History is a classic recommendation for anthropology and natural history, featuring a recently renovated Hall of Minerals and Gems.</li><li>Modern Museum of Art (MoMa) is a go-to for modern art, including works by Monet, van Gough, Dali, and Warhol.</li><li>The Metropolitan Museum of Art (The Met) features classical and contemporary art and artifacts from all around the world - from the dawn of human civilization to the present day.</li><li>The Guggenheim features abstract and thought-provoking art pieces.</li><li>The Color Factory is a pop-up exhibit offering an&nbsp; interactive, multi-sensory art experience, with lots of opportunities for great photos.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Cafes and Libraries</h2><ul><li>Our teammate, Arthur, coordinates our weekly \u201caround the city\u201d coworking sessions, and he\u2019s created a helpful list of excellent cafes: see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Zt8bxHmYF7Prc427ckHWR8vfX2Ph0L-Gyuaf3FoNoB0/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>here</u></a>!</li><li>New York Public Library 42nd St (take a photo with the famous stone lions, Patience and Fortitude).</li><li><a href=\"https://www.strandbooks.com/hours-locations\"><u>The Strand Bookstore</u></a> - a landmark!</li><li>Peacefood Cafe (Uptown or Downtown Manhattan).</li><li>Most WholeFoods locations in NYC have dining areas (and public bathrooms).</li></ul><h1>&nbsp;</h1><h1>Logistics</h1><h1><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Yq6yKgBtaMgkgyetm/iupu7rgx6taw8t0sbxf3\"></h1><p><strong>Above: map outlining NYC\u2019s subway station.</strong></p><p><i>The subway map looks more complicated than it is!</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Housing</h2><ul><li>Costs of living are expensive in New York; planning ahead will save you money!</li><li>Sometimes people in the community may have rooms open up for short periods or solely dedicated for guests.

The subway (usually) works. Streets are functional for biking or driving, the trains going outside the city (MetroNorth and LIRR) provide access to more nature and tourism, and it\u2019s relatively easy to get to other cities by bus, Amtrak, flights, etc.<ul><li>Many EA\u2019s often travel between NY and nearby Boston,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zQ7b9ghv3Tkd2LLNL/an-ea-s-guide-to-washington-dc\"><u>DC</u></a>, and/or Philadelphia!</li></ul></li><li>The subway system is generally pretty reliable, and you can tap-to-pay to access most locations without a metrocard.&nbsp;<ul><li>Most trains (ie. ones below grounds) don\u2019t have cell service while in motion, but service is available in most stations.<ul><li>So while it\u2019s ideal to load your trip ahead of time before entering the subway, if you need to make an adjustment, you can usually just get off at the next stop to load your map.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Sometimes taking a cab (see Lyft, Venmo, Curb, etc.) is quicker and more practical than the subway (just double check the traffic if you\u2019re in a hurry!). It\u2019s also sometimes cheaper in time and money than the subway if you\u2019re splitting the cost with a group of people and only going a short distance.</li><li>Don\u2019t be afraid to take the bus. It can feel a little intimidating, but if you\u2019re traveling within Brooklyn or Queens (or east-west in Manhattan), it may be your best bet! You can also use tap-to-pay ($2.75/ride, just like the subway) as you board.<ul><li>The printed schedules aren\u2019t always accurate; it\u2019s better to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bustime.mta.info/\"><u>use MTA Bus Time</u></a> to see realtime tracking of buses along your route.&nbsp;</li><li>But especially if it\u2019s hot, cold, humid, and/or raining, please plan ahead so you are not waiting outside in unsavory conditions!</li></ul></li><li>Find more tips in the Useful Apps section below!</li></ul></li><li>Metrocard:<ul><li>You can get a metrocard for the subway/bus, but most things accept tap-to-pay. There may be discounts if you plan out how many trips you\u2019re making and try to calculate the cost savings from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://new.mta.info/fares/how-to-save-money\"><u>MTA\u2019s website</u></a>, but this is difficult!</li><li>You can also use a metrocard for:<ul><li>&nbsp;taking the PATH to NJ (ie. if you know someone who lives there)</li><li>the Airtrain to/from JFK International Airport</li><li>&nbsp;the Tramway to Roosevelt Island<ul><li>If you're looking to get away from some of the NYC bustle, the ride on the tram offers a beautiful and interesting view (if you\u2019re reasonably comfortable with heights), and Roosevelt Island has a beautiful park and some interesting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smallpox_Hospital\"><u>ruins</u></a>.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Biking<ul><li>Biking is common, though we can\u2019t officially recommend it. Serious (sometimes fatal) accidents can and do occur: NYC drivers are quite aggressive and our infrastructure is not set up to keep bicyclists safe. (There is also the risk of bike theft, especially back wheels and seats.) Please take these safety precautions if you consider biking:<ul><li>wear a helmet</li><li>make sure you have lights and a working bell</li><li>make sure your bike is in good condition (brakes, gears, wheels, etc.)</li><li>consider using a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/motorcycle-bike-phone-mount-holder/dp/B01LWDCSIZ/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?crid=1MRZC70SOZGR4&amp;keywords=bicycle+phone+holder&amp;qid=1675656835&amp;sprefix=bicycle+phone+holde%2Caps%2C108&amp;sr=8-2-spons&amp;psc=1&amp;spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzQkVTM1g0WE5IRklBJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwOTA4NDczMVNNQTAwRUs5SjM3SiZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwMjQ2OTkxSFA1UFoxQUNPWE8md2lkZ2V0TmFtZT1zcF9hdGYmYWN0aW9uPWNsaWNrUmVkaXJlY3QmZG9Ob3RMb2dDbGljaz10cnVl\"><u>phone holder</u></a></li><li>make sure you can \u201csee and be seen\u201d (ie. have tail lights, wear bright/reflective clothes, don\u2019t wear headphones, \u201ckeep your head on a swivel,\u201d etc.)&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.bicyclehabitat.com/articles/security-pg80.htm\"><u>always lock your bike properly</u></a></li></ul></li><li>Bike shares are available and are pretty sweet (if you ignore the increased risks from cycling). Electric pedal assist bikes are often available through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://citibikenyc.com/\"><u>CitiBike</u></a>, and often strike a good balance of cost effectiveness, time efficiency, decreased COVID risk, and decreased cardiovascular health risks.</li></ul></li><li>Walking is also great and there\u2019s lots to see!<ul><li>Consider unstructured urban walks. Manhattan is dense with interestingly different neighborhoods and much&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.factcheck.org/2023/04/the-facts-on-manhattan-crime/\"><u>safer</u></a> than often perceived. Walking for an hour can feel like visiting several distinct cities.</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Visitor Visas (for casual visits / attending EAG(x)'s)</h2><p>Check out Elika and Vaidehi\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/W2w7xA9AtDnjcK6DP/an-ea-s-guide-to-berkeley-and-the-bay-area#Visitor_Visas__for_casual_visits___attending_EAG_x__s_\"><u>visa advice</u></a> from their EA guide to the Bay Area:</p><blockquote><p>This is not official legal / immigration advice, if you\u2019re uncertain on any of these points, contact a lawyer.

Apply as soon as possible, even if your exact travel plans are not set.&nbsp;</li><li>Just a note: non-US citizens are not allowed to work in the US without a visa that permits work authorization.&nbsp;</li><li>At the border:<ul><li>Border officials will ask you about the purpose of your trip.

And how are you preparing to join us ? You must be excited ! How beautiful and diverse our world is. But you know, humans are reckless, and we are messing up with humanity. In 1941, the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in order to put an end to the war! And what brought about the war in the first place ? Our inability to manage diversity. We are currently operating on tolerance , which seems to be an ineffective risk management tool in human interaction. You see, the dropping of the bombs claimed many innocent lives and caused serious injuries to the Earth systems. What scientists have not yet proven is the effect of such on the global scale !\nDid you know that when I was a future generation, humans enslaved humans ? How horrible and terrible a strain it was on humanity. History did not start with Rome, but Assyrians, Thracians, Gauls were reduced to slavery by Romans . And four hundred years ago, people of my kind, if you remember I said humanity is diverse. Yes ! People of my kind are majorly black , with black and brown skin, dark hair , strong corpulence, yeah ! The forefathers of my great great grandfathers were reduced to slavery by a syndicate of other people of other kinds. History recorded it that the lot fell on us because of our strong corpulence and endurance! People of my kind were so taken from Africa, our place of origin, to the Americas to work on plantations for some people called masters ! You know the master -slave- relationship was so horrible! It was such a difficult condition ! It was such a difficult experience ! It was the most despicable institution humans have ever invented ! And my people endured it. Although, slavery is abolished now! But it took another shape and form: economic, political, intellectual and cultural.   Humans are ingenuous ! Be warned ! Please,  choose which part of humanity you want to belong to. There are some regions in our world that  are hellish! Some people in those parts of the world experience multidimensional deprivation: food, potable water, access to basic medications, access to elementary and quality education, fulfilment of human dignity, and hope for  basic opportunities ! It is such a  messy condition! And I am currently experiencing such ! There are many of us in this situation! Do you think it has to do with our genes? Though some scientists from other kinds of humans believe it has. Well, I don't think so ! There is something missing that I have to figure out some day, then I will get back to you !</p>\n<p>Yeah, I was warning you about being careful in choosing which part of the world you belong to ! Of course, you don't have power over that ! It has to do with your destiny! Yes , destiny is such a powerful and mysterious thing! It determines your parents, your childhood , whether you grow as an orphan and have a difficult beginning or as a condoned child living with your parents in an idyllic world ! Though living with your parents doesn't not necessarily guarantee an idyllic life anyway ! Some children have parents yet they fend for themselves at the expense of their lives everyday ! Some have to go deep below the ground to extract minerals in Congo ! Some have to trade their dignity every night ! Some have to beg unkind givers in the streets of Lagos ! It is difficult! On the other hand,  Idyllic world belongs to those kids whose parents are rich ! Rich people tend to be happy and their children have everything they need and don't need !\nEither idyllic or not , the notion of family is no longer relevant today. There are children without parents ! Parents without children ! Wives without husbands ! Husbands without wives !  Families without home ! What a puzzling world!  You see my hometown is undergoing some metamorphosis too. Children can now take their parents to the court ! There is no more bond between husbands and wives ! Individualism has taken the lead, we don\u2019t seem to value our human bond. Materialism is more important than spirituality, our societies are falling apart. Money and cultural imperialism is threatening our identity. We are no longer African. How sad !\nIf I  have the opportunity to reincarnate, I would love to be African again ! That state of being natural and remaining  so natural. I love nature. What about you? What kind of habitat do you want to spend your future life in ? Things might not be the same forever , might they? I hope your world will be richer. Not the individual and material riches we hear from Forbes. Forbes seems to celebrate individual wealth.  And individual riches can't make the world a better place. Today  very few people are rich, you know. According to some statistics , that calculation taking into account various funny metrics, 1 % percent of the people in our world are rich and the rest 99% struggle with various types of poverty. We live in a colonized world. I am sure you will sympathize with the people of Palestine. Or the people of Africa for whom poverty is a permanent condition. How can humans design such a system? Such  an international order where one's quality of life depends on where one is  born? Do you think our ancestors failed in sowing the seeds of intragenerational and intergenerational solidarity? Are we not failing too? Shifting all the burden to future generations? How overwhelming the future would be !\nThe riches I mean here is compassion and humanity  which can serve as the social safety net for all. You know, when I was a kid in our village, I used to feel safe whenever I met a fellow human on a lone journey. Then we used to only fear lions and other beasts. But today, it is the opposite. How sad ! I hope your interaction with robots and machines would be benign without sacrificing family bonds.</p>\n<p>Today we make children in a hollow and material world. We interact more with machines than we do with humans. Everyone with his gadgets and humanity is on its on. Again, do you want to be a human being or a digital being? I guess science will figure it out. For me it is good to be human.</p>\n<p>Hmmm....let me tell you something terrible I experienced. In the year 2019, a pandemic broke out ! Its cause remained a mystery. We don't know whether it was due to a lab escape or a zoonotic spillover. You know humans are terrible ! We do all sorts of things that threaten our survival. Especially the scientists ! They conduct all sorts of experiments either for good or bad purposes . So I don't know if the cause of the pandemic was a result of good experimentation or not ! All I know is that many people died ! It was a traumatizing experience ! The thing allegedly  started from China, you know Chinese people are creative and hardworking.  You might have the opportunity to know them if human civilization continues . Well , I still don't know if they created the virus that caused the pandemic. It was called COVID-19! Such a terrible thing that claimed millions of lives ! But people in Africa survived it against all odds and predictions ! Was it destiny? The year 2019 was a difficult one, we were forced to stay at home and avoid contact with other people. Many people in my region starved !\nSchools, markets, mosques and churches were closed ! Only hospitals and cemeteries opened ! People died !</p>\n<p>Today, we have put the pandemic behind us. But the world remain the same ! Rich people versus poor people, the powerful versus the weak. Russia invaded Ukraine. The invasion had implications on my people! Although it happened far away from us , but we felt its heat. Gas, flour , fertilizer and other things became scarce and expensive. Businesses made a lot of money out of the poor. Such a terrible time ! In Ukraine, we heard about people being killed and some displaced . Cities being bombed and soldiers dying every minute! Our world is beautiful and terrible ! I hope you will pass that stage in your time ! Wars ! They serve no one's interest! Well, the victims' interests ! But I don't know what the US and Russia want, they like wars ! Cuba, Afghanistan, Libya, Sudan, North Kivu are all terrible war zones. In a nutshell, we are currently at war ! Our environment is getting stressed ! Heat, flood, pollution, acid raid, drought. But scientists seem to be doing something about it. They are building a system that can solve most of this problems. They are developing artificial intelligence! That double edged blade! It might be good or bad for humanity. Pray that it is good, for otherwise you might not exist! Scientists, you know they are terrible , they predict that bad artificial intelligence might mean the end of humanity. If things go wrong, humans will go extinct like dinosaurs. And digital beings will take over! Do you want to be  human or digital?  I think it's good to be human:) pray that scientists get things right ! I hope to hear from soon ! If I did not hear from you , I assume we are extinct!</p>\n<p>Warm regards,</p>\n<p>Alimi SALIFOU</p>\n", "user": {"username": "Alimi"}}, {"_id": "pECcfcevpjJCbRLQJ", "title": "The way EA uses \"legible\" is not very legible", "postedAt": "2023-07-15T17:14:03.432Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I was pretty confused when I first saw phrases like \"legible impact\" and \"legible goals\".

This post is mostly made up of an excerpt from our book on effective grantmaking (\u2018<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Launch-High-Impact-Foundation-Joey-Savoie-ebook/dp/B0CH8Z3K3H/ref=sr_1_1?crid=WLOGHF481IYN&amp;keywords=how+to+launch+a+high-impact+foundation&amp;qid=1698424778&amp;sprefix=how+to+launch+a+high-impact+foundation%2Caps%2C188&amp;sr=8-1\">How to Launch a High-Impact Foundation</a>\u2019), followed by a discussion of the theory of change for our Incubation Program.&nbsp;</p><h1>TL;DR</h1><ul><li>It is very common for non-profit organizations (even EA orgs) to have no public theory of change, or to have a poor one. This is a big problem, because theories of change are the business models of the nonprofit world \u2013 you shouldn\u2019t launch, fund or work for a project that doesn\u2019t have a strong one!&nbsp;</li><li>A theory of change explicitly articulates the cause-and-effect steps for how a project or organization can turn inputs into a desired impact on the world (i.e. it\u2019s their theory of how they\u2019ll make a change). They generally include the following sections:<ul><li>Inputs / activities: What the project or organization does to create change (e.g. \u201cdistribute bednets\u201d)</li><li>Outputs: The tangible effects generated by the inputs (e.g. \u201cbeneficiaries have access to malaria nets\u201d)</li><li>Intermediate outcomes: The outputs\u2019 effects, including benefits for the beneficiary, (e.g. \u201cmalaria nets are used\u201d and \"reduced incidence of malaria\")</li><li>Impact: What we\u2019re ultimately solving, and why the intermediate outcomes matter (e.g. \u201clives saved\u201d)</li></ul></li><li>Best practices when crafting a theory of change (i.e. for creators):<ul><li>Invest sufficiently in understanding the problem context (i.e. understanding the needs and incentives of the beneficiaries and other stakeholders, as well as barriers to change and the economic &amp; political context)</li><li>Map the causal pathway backwards from impact to activities</li><li>Question every causal step (is it clear why A should cause B? how might it fail?)</li></ul></li><li>Hallmarks of an excellent theory of change (i.e. for reviewers):<ul><li>A focused suite of activities</li><li>The evidence and assumptions behind each step are explicitly named</li><li>The relative confidence of each step is clear</li><li>It is clear who the actor is in each step</li></ul></li><li>Common mistakes to avoid in theories of change are:<ul><li>Not making fundamental impact the goal (e.g., stopping at \u2018increased immunizations\u2019 instead of \u2018improved health\u2019)</li><li>Being insufficiently detailed: (a) making large leaps between each step, (b) combining multiple major outcomes into one step (e.g. \u2018government introduces and enforces regulation\u2019).</li><li>Setting and forgetting (instead of regularly iterating on it)</li><li>Not building your theory of change into a measurement plan</li></ul></li></ul><h1>The \u2018what\u2019 and \u2018why\u2019 of a theory of change</h1><p>Building something complicated without an explicit plan is risky. From skyscrapers to software, ambitious projects need detailed blueprints. When building an effective nonprofit organization, the theory of change is that blueprint.</p><p>In the same way that you wouldn\u2019t hire a builder who intends to build you a home without a blueprint, you shouldn\u2019t fund a leader who intends to build an organization or launch a project without a theory of change. If the builder planned to create something particularly cutting-edge, like a home made entirely out of recycled cardboard that doesn\u2019t need heating or cooling, you\u2019d be particularly adamant that the builder explains exactly how this is possible and what evidence or assumptions it depends on. The same applies when it comes to funding an ambitious project that aims to improve the world.&nbsp;</p><p>A theory of change explicitly articulates the logical steps of a plan to achieve a specific goal. It is generally represented in the form of a cause-and-effect diagram. A well-designed theory of change allows an organization to clearly communicate its activities and how they lead to the desired outcomes, and then to impact.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefovi991yjqc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnovi991yjqc\">[1]</a></sup></span><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9t7St3pfEEiDsQ2Tr/iw6pot016dtf8fljan7m\"></p><p>In fact, theories of change are more important for charities than business models are for businesses, because businesses have better feedback loops. If a for-profit is based on a bad idea, or is badly executed, it will see poor revenue and it will soon go out of business. On the other hand, if a charity is ineffective, it may limp along for years without having any impact, squandering limited funding and talent in the process.</p><p>Foundations deciding which opportunities to fund should expect a clear theory of change as table-stakes for potential grantees. In addition to spelling out how the potential grantee intends to convert your funding into impact, theories of change will allow you to determine how confident you can be that impact will be achieved. Is the causal chain tight, or convoluted? Are the steps well substantiated by evidence, or based on tenuous assumptions? Can any assumptions be easily tested? What is the crux that the project\u2019s success depends on? A smart nonprofit will use its theory of change to identify its priorities for measurement and evaluation, and as the blueprint for its first cost-effectiveness analysis,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefynpf38ba1ic\"><sup><a href=\"#fnynpf38ba1ic\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;which foundations can then use to inform funding decisions.</p><h2>Real world examples</h2><h3>Example 1: A research organization</h3><p>Imagine an organization that wants to use research to make a difference. Without an explicit theory of change, their implicit mental model of how they might make an impact may look something like this:</p><p><strong>Review literature \u2b62 Find insights that seem useful \u2b62 Publish them</strong></p><p>This is not a good theory of change. It doesn\u2019t properly outline the goal, it doesn\u2019t explain how the actions will lead to that goal, and it doesn\u2019t explain how they will measure what they are doing. Presumably, the final goal is to impact living beings positively, not just publish papers. Even if the organization works very hard and puts out many widely cited papers, it\u2019s possible that it will not make any difference.&nbsp;</p><p>Compare this implicit model to an explicit theory of change published by a young charity after they went through one of Charity Entrepreneurship\u2019s early incubation programs:</p><p><br><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9t7St3pfEEiDsQ2Tr/bzgcigszvg0zvvjeqrm2\"><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref67jlkzrg05g\"><sup><a href=\"#fn67jlkzrg05g\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p>On the left, you can see the charity's core research agenda at a glance (the inputs/activities). On the right, you can see some measurable metrics such as money moved, new projects, and hires made (intermediate outcomes) which lead to the final impact \u2013 happier lives.</p><p>This is definitely an improvement on the implicit mental model:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>It connects activities all the way to impact (more complete)</li><li>It gives a clearer depiction of what the activities actually look like (more concrete)</li><li>It makes it easy to spot that \u201ccommunicating to individuals and key organizations\u201d is a crux of this process, which needs extra care and attention when it comes to execution (more action-guiding)&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Having developed this theory of change, they will be more likely to give adequate focus to ensuring that they don\u2019t just publish research, but that the right people read it and change their actions (e.g. fund more impactful organizations, start more impactful projects, or measure impact in a more appropriate manner).&nbsp;</p><p>That being said, this theory of change has significant room for improvement. In particular, the intermediate steps between communicating the research and organizations changing their actions ought to be spelled out: After receiving the evidence, organizations need to understand it, value it, and use it to change policies or ways of thinking. There are many ways that this could go wrong, resulting in little or no impact. Leaving this out of the picture risks these crucial details being neglected.</p><h3>Example 2: A conditional cash transfer program</h3><p>Below is a theory of change for a program that uses cash transfers to increase child immunization rates in India.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefy28ncv891x\"><sup><a href=\"#fny28ncv891x\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The program has two \u201cinput\u201d actions: providing resources to keep immunization camps reliably open, and providing cash incentives to people who get vaccinated.&nbsp;</p><p><img style=\"width:82.57%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9t7St3pfEEiDsQ2Tr/pienpzpwtrqyfsf2fav6\"></p><p>What\u2019s particularly attractive about this theory of change is how measurable each step is. For example, we can send someone to check and see if a camp is reliably open. We can create a verification system to check if incentives are delivered. We can count how many children come to the camps, and how often they return for their booster shots. If something is going wrong, we can check the assumptions that are explicitly listed (e.g. surveying parents to see if they trust the camps).&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9t7St3pfEEiDsQ2Tr/zuw0vepu782xstme0hyw\"></p><p>As a result of the clear, measurable theory of change, J-PAL (The Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab) was able to evaluate the performance of the program to come to a view on its cost-effectiveness.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwrvg4x2knce\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwrvg4x2knce\">[5]</a></sup></span></p><h1>The \u2018how\u2019 of theory of change</h1><p>Creating a theory of change involves linking up a number of cause-effect relationships (based on scientific evidence, expert advice, or well-reasoned assumptions), to form a path from inputs to impact. It is the type of skill that is hard to teach in the form of a list of explicit instructions \u2013 rather, it is best learned by doing and by looking at real examples, and noticing what it is about them that is effective or ineffective.&nbsp;</p><h2>Tips for crafting a theory of change (Do\u2019s)</h2><ol><li><strong>Invest sufficiently in understanding the context of the problem:&nbsp;</strong>As anyone who works in the nonprofit sector will confirm, solving the world\u2019s problems isn\u2019t easy. Things might seem simple (e.g. \u2018vaccinations save lives, so all we need to do is produce enough vaccines and we\u2019ll save lots of lives!\u2019), but the world is complicated and the devil is in the details (consider all the ways that the theory of change in Example 2 could go wrong). To craft a theory of change that works in reality, it\u2019s crucial that you sufficiently understand reality. This means you need to understand exactly who the people you intend to serve are and what their wants, needs and views are (e.g. who has most control over whether a child is vaccinated \u2013 the child? their parents? public institutions like schools?). You also need to understand the barriers that have prevented people from resolving the problems they face, you need to understand who the stakeholders are, what their incentives are, and you need to sufficiently understand the broader political and economic context. People who have spent time on the ground understanding the context tend to design the most realistic theories of change.</li><li><strong>Map the causal pathway backwards from impact to activities:&nbsp;</strong>Programs should be defined by starting with the problem and looking for the best solution, rather than by starting with a set of activities in mind and trying to find a plausible story for how those activities could solve the problem. Working backwards reduces your susceptibility to confirmation bias, because instead of asking \u2018what evidence can I find that this activity causes the desired effect?\u2019, you\u2019re forced to ask \u2018what activity does the evidence say is most effective at causing the desired effect?\u2019</li><li><strong>Question every causal step:&nbsp;</strong>Given how easy it is for a charitable program to have minimal impact, and given the stakes, we recommend approaching each theory of change with a healthy skepticism. For each causal step, ask yourself: Is it clear why A would cause B? How might this step fail? Can we justify how confident we are in this step?</li></ol><h2>Hallmarks of an excellent theory of change (Some more Do\u2019s)</h2><ol><li><strong>A focused suite of activities:</strong> A common way that charities become inefficient is through mission creep. The reasoning goes something like, \u2018if we\u2019re already providing mosquito nets to prevent malaria, why not also provide vitamin supplements, or distribute essential medicines?\u2019 Sometimes adding more activities is efficient, squeezing more impact out of a similar fixed-cost base. But most of the time it isn\u2019t. This is the case for a number of reasons; for example, more activities means that an organization\u2019s focus is split between competing priorities. More activities means more coordination costs at the organization. Adding additional activities that are less cost-effective than the first ones will often hurt average cost-effectiveness more than the synergies help it. Meanwhile, there is an incentive for organizations to add more activities to their theory of change, because individuals, donors and undiscerning funders often think it is more impressive to have a larger, more holistic suite of programs. As a result, we have a heuristic that theories of change with a tight suite of activities tend to be stronger than those with a long list of activities that span a number of distinct interventions.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Explicitly naming the evidence or assumptions behind each step:</strong> One practice we\u2019d like to see in more theories of change, is an indication of the evidence, or the assumptions, behind each step. This makes it easier for outsiders to vet the theory of change: They can review the evidence and check whether they agree with the assumptions. It also makes it clear which steps are most in need of measurement to validate assumptions.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Communicating the relative confidence in each step:&nbsp;</strong>The most transparent theories of change make it clear which steps are the most tenuous or liable to fail, so that both those reviewing the plan and those implementing it can focus on those steps. This can be done by color coding the arrows or boxes, and ideally can be accompanied by explicit probability estimates.</li><li><strong>Making it clear who the actor is in each step:</strong> The clearest theories of change explain who is supposed to take the action in each intermediate step (e.g. instead of \u2018children are brought to immunization camps\u2019, it should be \u2018parents bring children to immunization camps\u2019). This makes the mechanics of the intervention clearer to outside readers, and makes it easier to think about and prepare for how the step could go wrong (\u2018why might the parents not bring their children?\u2019).</li></ol><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9t7St3pfEEiDsQ2Tr/l789onhsuapea6vssvme\"></p><h2>Common mistakes to watch out for (Don\u2019ts)</h2><ol><li><strong>Not making fundamental impact the goal:&nbsp;</strong>The conditional cash transfer example is a good theory of change, but can it be improved? Immunization isn\u2019t the end goal \u2013 saving lives and improving quality of life is. This may seem obvious, but it is very important to note it explicitly so that we remember to model how much disease is actually prevented, and how many lives are actually saved by increasing immunization. If we skip this step, we might (for instance) end up choosing a location that maximizes the number of people who can be immunized (e.g. an area that has a good network of vaccination clinics), rather than one that maximizes the number of lives we can counterfactually save (e.g. by picking a location with a high disease burden).&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Insufficiently detailed:&nbsp;</strong>Many theories of change make the mistake of leaving out important details in two ways:<br><ol><li><u>&nbsp;Making large leaps between each step.</u> For example:<br><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Publish research \u2b62 lives are saved</strong><br><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Raise awareness \u2b62 less suffering</strong><br>By breaking these steps down into the main sub-steps, each of which depend on assumptions that we can\u2019t be certain about, it becomes clear that these theories of change are a lot less likely to work than they initially appear.&nbsp;</li><li><u>Combining multiple major outcomes in one step.</u> The best theories of change break out significant, independent outcomes like \u2018government introduces regulation\u2019 and \u2018government enforces regulation\u2019 into separate steps, so that the important risk that something goes wrong in between is made salient. By contrast, \u2018government introduces and enforces regulation\u2019 makes it easy to forget that it\u2019s possible for regulation to be introduced but not enforced.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li><strong>Set and forget:</strong> Many organizations design a theory of change very early on, then put it in a drawer and never look at it again. Theories of change should be treated as living documents that are constantly revised as the charity tests things and gains new information.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Not building your theory of change into a measurement plan:</strong> One of the key purposes of articulating a theory of change is to determine what to measure so that you can validate whether and how much impact an intervention is having. A good theory of change makes it clear what steps are the most uncertain, and so most in need of measurement. Despite this, it\u2019s common for charities to have no measurement plan at all, and when they do, for it to not be designed with reference to the theory of change. We will discuss this further in Chapter 5.2 on monitoring and evaluation.</li></ol><h1>Theory of change for foundations</h1><p>There are two places where theories of change play a major role in grantmaking foundations\u2019 decision-making:</p><ol><li>Assessing grantees</li><li>Defining a theory of change for the foundation itself</li></ol><h2>Assessing grantees</h2><p>The most obvious place for theories of change to play a role, is that grantmakers should expect that all potential grantees have a theory of change for their organization or project, or at least that they can produce one when asked. Funders in the nonprofit space need to hold implementing actors to account on implementing an explicit, realistic and well-evidenced plan for turning funding into impact.&nbsp;</p><p>Better yet, grantmakers should expect that recipient organizations use their theory of change to identify priorities for their monitoring and evaluation plan, and that they build a cost-effectiveness analysis based on the theory of change\u2019s structure (quantifying the costs of their inputs, and the size and probability of the desired outputs, outcomes and impact).</p><h2>Theory of change for the foundation</h2><p>It may be a little less intuitive, but theories of change also have a place in a foundation\u2019s decision-making by articulating the strategy for how the foundation itself will have impact.&nbsp;</p><h3>Direct impact of grantmaking</h3><p>At first thought, it might seem like there would be one theory of change for how all foundations have impact: \u2018we fund impactful activities\u2019. In this sense, a foundation\u2019s theory of change is the sum of each of its grantees\u2019, with an additional input at the beginning:</p><p><img style=\"width:92.56%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9t7St3pfEEiDsQ2Tr/lsab5tg5qbtfkkrvhpsk\"></p><p>In some cases, foundations can define their theory of change in terms of a specific problem (e.g. inhumane chicken farming) or a specific type of solution (e.g. plant-based alternatives) that they have decided to focus on, where the theory of change reflects their view of the best strategy for how to improve the world within this focus area:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9t7St3pfEEiDsQ2Tr/icherwzw8kyzyvaektwz\"></p><p>Armed with this kind of strategically-framed theory of change, foundations can seek grantees who can make a contribution and can publicly communicate how other organizations can play a role in realizing their vision. The downside of this type of theory of change for a foundation is that it forces you to have a clear and narrow view of the problem you will focus on, and how it can best be solved. As a result, this approach isn\u2019t suitable for all foundations, and when foundations do take this approach, they should be mindful not to become anchored to one narrow view of how to improve the world.&nbsp;</p><h3>Indirect foundation impact</h3><p>In addition to the direct impact of providing funding, a foundation can also have broader&nbsp;<strong><u>impact through thought leadership</u></strong>. For example, you might publish research (like Open Philanthropy\u2019s reports on different cause areas), write blog posts (like the Mulago Foundation), develop impact metrics (like CE\u2019s Welfare Points) or create public cost-effectiveness analyses of charities and interventions (like GiveWell).&nbsp;</p><p>Foundations can also have impact by<strong> <u>influencing their network</u></strong> (which may include other high net-worth individuals, or even other foundations) to give more, or give more effectively. There are a number of other ways foundations can go about creating leverage, effectively multiplying their spending, such as by accessing government funding.&nbsp;</p><p>Another way of having an impact is by<strong> <u>setting good norms in the nonprofit sector</u></strong>; making it a public policy to only fund organizations who follow certain best practices (e.g. pre-committing to shut down if the M&amp;E doesn\u2019t show a predetermined threshold of cost-effectiveness).&nbsp;</p><p>Meanwhile, it is overly narrow to only think about the impact of grant dollars in terms of the inputs that those dollars fund. For example, sometimes when a foundation gives a grant to an early stage organization, it makes the difference between them going insolvent, and them surviving long enough to scale into a massively impactful charity (like the Against Malaria Foundation).&nbsp;<strong><u>By ensuring the longevity of a highly impactful charity</u></strong>, the impact of the grant is not just the immediate activities covered by that money, but some percentage of all of the good that the organization goes on to do in the long term. Similarly, foundations can be active in their grantmaking,&nbsp;<strong><u>influencing how many and what type of projects come into existence</u></strong>. They then are partially responsible for those projects\u2019 lifetime impact, beyond the activities they fund directly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9t7St3pfEEiDsQ2Tr/ooa8uxyddol09ui8omni\"></p><p>In some cases, these other forms of impact end up being much larger than the direct impact of the grants themselves! But the chances of this being the case accidentally are low \u2013 it takes thought and effort. For this reason, we encourage foundations to define their own theory of change, so that they make a conscious decision about which of these other forms of impact they will work to cultivate.&nbsp;</p><h1>Charity Entreneurship\u2019s theory of change for its Incubation Program</h1><p>We\u2019ve spent this post \u2018talking the talk\u2019 when it comes to theories of change, but now it\u2019s time to \u2018walk the walk\u2019.

For example, all of the crucial work of our operations team is absent, as is the work of the co-founder team to set the strategic direction and ensure proper functioning of each department. This is intentional, as it\u2019s important to keep the TOC as tight as possible to increase clarity and comprehensibility. Inputs that truly go without saying need not be included \u2013 however in our experience people tend to leave out more than they should.</p><p>The TOC reveals some of the risks to our Incubation Program\u2019s impact, for example:</p><ul><li>We may be at risk of exhausting the talent pool, particularly within the Effective Altruism movement, and so we need to continue to innovate in our approach to outreach.&nbsp;</li><li>Program facilitation is likely not optimal, hurting the number and quality of charities founded. Whilst we believe we are continuing to make progress on this front, it\u2019s difficult to be certain because trends in program outcomes are hard to measure precisely (due to the small sample sizes, both in terms of the number of cohorts and number of participants per cohort). It\u2019s also hard to know to what extent trends in program outcomes can be attributed to the facilitation itself, because other highly variable factors \u2013 like how participants\u2019 co-founder and idea preferences end up shaking out \u2013 significantly shape how much impact each cohort produces.</li><li>The ability of the funding landscape to support charities through the \u2018valley of death\u2019 is a bottleneck to scaling the incubation program to found more charities per year.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Whilst the evidence we have for the impact of the Incubation Program is fairly strong, one weakness that this TOC illustrates is that several pieces of evidence are predicated on the assumption that funders always make sound decisions, when in reality, getting funding and achieving impact are not necessarily correlated and weak orgs sometimes limp along and take up resources far longer than they should. The exercise of formally documenting this TOC has reinforced for us the importance of the external impact evaluations of our more mature incubated charities that we have planned for 2024. We hope that these evaluations will significantly increase the rigor and objectivity of our M&amp;E.</p><h1>Conclusion and next steps</h1><p>I hope this discussion has convinced you of the importance of nailing the theory of change for any non-profit program to be impactful.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>If you are personally involved in a non-profit program</strong> (either as a funder or an implementor):&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Does the program have a high quality theory of change?&nbsp;</li><li>Is it publicly available?</li><li>Is the entire organization familiar with it?</li><li>Have you gone through the process of tearing it to shreds and then rebuilding it better than before?</li><li>Is your organization willing to stop supporting the program if the theory of change looks too weak?</li></ul><p>If the answer to any of these questions is \u2018no\u2019, you have work to do.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>If you are interested in applying to participate in the Incubation Program:</strong> Applications are now open.

These things are great, and this kind of charitable aid saves lives every day.&nbsp; But there\u2019s something a little curious here, because these interventions AREN\u2019T what helped the world\u2019s most prosperous countries succeed in the first place.&nbsp;</p><p>Up until the 1700s, essentially the entire population of the planet lived in poverty.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyegw0rovll\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyegw0rovll\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;

the example of Itana, Nigeria</h2><p>Well, in 2009, Nobel-prize-winning economist Paul Romer proposed a new strategy.&nbsp; He argued that going through the painstaking process of fighting for incremental changes from within the existing system might not always be a country\u2019s best choice.&nbsp; Sometimes, it might be easier to start from scratch, developing an entirely new city with a new legal code and new institutions, inspired by the best international examples.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqgm096dav7k\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqgm096dav7k\">[4]</a></sup></span></p><p>Charter cities, Romer said, would be like a nation within a nation.&nbsp; They\u2019ll still need to follow their mother country\u2019s constitution, criminal code, and international treaties, but should otherwise be given the freedom to design their own legal code to encourage the growth of new industries -- setting their own immigration rules, tax codes, business regulations, civil court systems, and more.&nbsp; The way that the city holds elections, the structure of its government, and the way it provides public services could all be designed based on the playbook of success stories like Singapore.</p><p>There aren\u2019t many charter cities that exist today, but for a real-world example, let\u2019s look at \u201c<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/7a0419bf-e76f-4abb-8024-043ee24e4382\">Itana</a>\u201d, a small charter city project being spearheaded by the Nigerian entrepreneur Iyinolowa Aboyeji<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref92t3clnfpxj\"><sup><a href=\"#fn92t3clnfpxj\">[5]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp; Itana is a town being built near Lagos, designed to attract talented tech workers from across Africa to found their own new companies or work remotely for employers overseas.&nbsp; Of course, in order to realize that dream, Itana is going to need a stable supply of electricity and a strong internet connection.&nbsp; But that\u2019s difficult in Nigeria, which has struggled for decades with electrical blackouts and grid collapses, only managing to provide power for about four hours out of each day.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4q7cwqyrmkg\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4q7cwqyrmkg\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; One of the many obstacles to better service is that the government insists power be provided very cheaply.&nbsp; It\u2019s a vote-winning policy, but it makes power companies reluctant to transmit electricity that they\u2019re forced to buy at a high price and sell at a loss.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefny49xy19cyb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnny49xy19cyb\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; This is one reason Itana wants the ability to write its own business regulations -- if Itana could choose to pay a higher price for more consistent power, that could set the stage for a brighter future.</p><p>Furthermore, in order to attract talented people from across all of Africa, it would be great if Itana could write its own, town-specific immigration rules, granting visas quickly instead of having them go through an arduous, months-long process.&nbsp;

Who would want to be the first to move there?&nbsp; It\u2019s true that this might seem drastic in places like the United states, where no new large cities have been built in the last hundred years.&nbsp; But across Latin America, Africa, and Asia, millions of people move from the countryside to urban areas each year, with the United Nations expecting 2.5 billion new city-dwellers by 2050.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhjdwd91ojwc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhjdwd91ojwc\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; Urbanization in many countries is happening so fast that it\u2019s outpacing the ability of existing cities to build supporting infrastructure -- leading to problems with providing clean water, electricity, and so on.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkrjrqlyc38\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkrjrqlyc38\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; Lagos, for instance, is one of the fastest-growing cities in the world, doubling in size over the past twenty years from seven million to fourteen million people.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7wyfzg24rp5\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7wyfzg24rp5\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; Building out infrastructure for new charter cities would help channel the power of this urbanization to create healthy, productive engines of long-term growth, rather than stressing existing megacities with continuing haphazard, unplanned sprawl.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iwcCBLqfmhG2sshHN/fkmlqgg8zhgkirhmfjwf\" alt=\"undefined\"></figure><h2>Objection: Political Tractability</h2><p>A bigger problem is political feasibility.&nbsp; The whole point of giving a city the ability to write its own rules is to make reform easier, but in order to get that ball rolling, you first need to find a nation willing to give away lots of their own regulation-writing authority in order to enable your charter city project.&nbsp; This isn\u2019t completely unheard of -- in many ways, charter cities are just a bigger and bolder version of \u201cSpecial Economic Zones\u201d, where a port might be granted lower tariffs or streamlined permitting for the sake of spurring industrial development.&nbsp; Nevertheless, asking for broad autonomy to create an entire city is a tall order.</p><p>Indeed, Paul Romer was originally involved in efforts to create charter cities in Madagascar and Honduras, but later abandoned both projects.&nbsp; Despite being invited by each country\u2019s president, the idea became politically controversial in both nations, and the project in Madagascar fell apart when the president\u2019s party was voted out of power.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref92bjlvcwww\"><sup><a href=\"#fn92bjlvcwww\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; In Honduras, a law authorizing charter cities was passed after years of political wrangling, but Paul Romer distanced himself from the result, saying that Honduran corporate special interests had corrupted his original vision.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgd8q0v9v2hf\"><sup><a href=\"#fngd8q0v9v2hf\">[12]</a></sup></span></p><h2>Wider benefits: inspiration, competition, &amp; experimentation</h2><p>Charter cities are a new idea -- the first projects are just getting started now -- so we don\u2019t know for sure how politically tractable they\u2019ll be to create, or how effectively they\u2019ll boost growth.&nbsp; But these uncertainties should be weighed against the immense potential benefit -- the chance to lift millions of residents out of poverty through improved governance and sustainable economic growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And, it gets even better, because it\u2019s likely that the growth-boosting benefits of charter cities could spread to far more people than just the residents who move there.&nbsp; There are three main ways this could happen: inspiration, competition, and experimentation.</p><p><strong>First, seeing legal reforms work well on a small scale could inspire larger national changes.</strong>&nbsp; For instance, Itana in Nigeria is only planned to be a small town of a few thousand people at first.&nbsp; But if Itana\u2019s ideas prove successful, they might inspire national-level policy changes that could improve the lives of all of Nigeria\u2019s 200 million inhabitants.</p><p><strong>Second, is the idea that charter cities could spur \u201cgovernance competition\u201d.</strong>&nbsp; If you give people lots of options about where and how to live, people will naturally flock to the places that offer them the most freedom, safety, and prosperity.&nbsp; Unfortunately, right now, lots of people don\u2019t have many good options, and that makes it easier for governments to restrict people\u2019s rights or otherwise exploit their citizens.&nbsp; In a world with lots of charter cities, fewer people will have to put up with that kind of abuse, and would-be exploitative governments will be pressured to start treating their citizens better, lest they start losing all their best people to the city next door.</p><p><strong>Finally, experimenting with totally new types of law could bring huge benefits.</strong>&nbsp; What about going beyond just imitating the best practices of developed countries, and instead trying to do even better?&nbsp; Since charter cities are building whole new laws and institutions from a clean slate, it\u2019ll also be easier for them to experiment with radically new concepts which, if successful, could become leading examples for the whole world.</p><p>For example, <a href=\"https://www.prospera.co/\">Prospera</a> is a charter city that\u2019s currently operating within a special economic zone in Honduras.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefx9utpm23d3\"><sup><a href=\"#fnx9utpm23d3\">[13]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;They've implemented a completely novel legal framework that enables rapid innovation across industries.

A city could also try out improved ways of voting, like \u201cliquid democracy\u201d, or they could take inspiration from a previous video of ours, and have the city government use prediction markets to help inform important public decisions.&nbsp;

Today\u2019s projects are small, with uncertain prospects.&nbsp; But consider this: two hundred and fifty years ago, the United States was small and uncertain.&nbsp; It was experimenting with a bizarre, Roman-era style of government called \u201cdemocracy\u201d, and nobody knew if it would really work.&nbsp; But over time, democracy proved so successful that it inspired countless nations around the world to make the switch -- and this new system led to greater peace, faster economic growth, and more human freedom.&nbsp;</p><p>If some of today\u2019s charter cities are successful, then maybe the idea of semi-autonomous cities could spread across the world just like democracy did.&nbsp; A century from now, maybe the idea that promoting governance competition leads to faster growth and greater liberty, will seem just as obvious as the idea that an elected president usually provides better leadership than a dictator or a king.&nbsp; Charter cities today are focused on making life better for the people who choose to move there.&nbsp; But if we\u2019re lucky, they might help make our civilization wiser, richer, fairer, and better able to navigate future challenges.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iwcCBLqfmhG2sshHN/andtjpyrtidq3tennxwp\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iwcCBLqfmhG2sshHN/mwqglptf62notntgniti 113w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iwcCBLqfmhG2sshHN/q2pcvcsh2iw5jt1w3zjc 193w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iwcCBLqfmhG2sshHN/mt7yyoalwbyphl2ofdi0 273w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iwcCBLqfmhG2sshHN/jexqdaymangffac54gdd 353w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iwcCBLqfmhG2sshHN/evnlfw68kwmb5a6mxajt 433w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iwcCBLqfmhG2sshHN/jtlx9eyq7epjzbnebar9 513w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iwcCBLqfmhG2sshHN/svehjvgzmkj4mjhhdhmt 593w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iwcCBLqfmhG2sshHN/abu5nqldow3mothm5nho 673w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iwcCBLqfmhG2sshHN/moxodwe6m8n2aqk8gxit 753w\"></figure><h2>Resources to learn more</h2><p>If you loved this video, consider checking out the website of the Charter Cities Institute to learn more.&nbsp;

We evaluate organizations that have received more than $10 million per year in funding and that have had limited external evaluation.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefznxd9e1a7l\"><sup><a href=\"#fnznxd9e1a7l\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>The primary authors of this series include one technical AI safety researcher (&gt;4 years experience), and one non-technical person with experience in the EA community. Some posts also have contributions from others with experience in technical AI safety and/or the EA community.&nbsp;</p><p>This introduction was written after the first two posts in the series were published. Since we first started working on this series we have updated and refined our process for evaluating and publishing critiques, and this post reflects our present views.</p><h1><strong>Why are we writing this series?</strong></h1><p>Recently, there has been more attention on the field of technical AI safety (TAIS), meaning that many people are trying to get into TAIS roles. Without knowing significant context about different organizations, new entrants to the field will tend to apply to TAIS organizations based on their prominence, which is largely related to factors such as total funding, media coverage, volume of output, etc, rather than just the quality of their research or approach. Much of the discussion we have observed about TAIS organizations, especially criticisms of them, happens behind closed doors, in conversations that junior people are usually not privy to. We wish to help disseminate this information more broadly to enable individuals to make a better informed decision.</p><p>We focus on evaluating large organizations, defined as those with more than $10 million per year in funding. These organizations are amongst the most visible and tend to have a significant influence on the AI safety ecosystem by virtue of their size, making evaluation particularly important. Additionally, these organizations would only need to dedicate a small fraction of their resources to engaging with these criticisms.</p><h1><strong>How do we evaluate organizations?</strong></h1><p>We believe that an organization should be graded on multiple metrics. We consider:</p><ul><li><strong>Research outputs</strong>: How much good quality research has the organization published? This is the area where we put the most weight.</li><li><strong>Research agenda:</strong> Does the organization\u2019s research plan seem likely to bear fruit?&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Research team</strong>: What proportion of researchers are senior/experienced? What is the leadership\u2019s experience in ML and safety research? Are the leaders trustworthy? Are there conflicts of interest?&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Strategy and governance</strong>: What corporate governance structures are in place? Does the organization have independent accountability? How transparent is it? The FTX crisis has shown how important this can be.</li><li><strong>Organizational culture and work environment</strong>: Does the organization foster a good work environment for their team? What efforts has the organization made to improve its work culture?</li></ul><p>When evaluating research outputs, we benchmark against high-quality existing research, and against academia. Although academic AIS research is not always the most novel or insightful, there are strong standards for rigor in academia that we believe are important. Some existing research that we think is exceptional include:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/qHCDysDnvhteW7kRd/arc-s-first-technical-report-eliciting-latent-knowledge\"><u>Eliciting latent knowledge</u></a> (ARC)</li><li><a href=\"https://ai-alignment.com/iterated-distillation-and-amplification-157debfd1616\"><u>Iterated Distillation and Amplification</u></a> (Paul Christiano)</li><li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.08073\"><u>Constitutional AI</u></a> (Anthropic)</li><li><a href=\"https://trojandetection.ai/\"><u>Trojan Detection Competition</u></a> (CAIS)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JvZhhzycHu2Yd57RN/causal-scrubbing-a-method-for-rigorously-testing\"><u>Causal scrubbing</u></a> (Redwood)</li><li><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.10652\"><u>Toy models of superposition</u></a> (Anthropic)</li></ul><h2>Our thoughts on hits-based research agendas&nbsp;</h2><p>When we criticized Conjecture\u2019s output, commenters <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gkfMLX4NWZdmpikto/critiques-of-prominent-ai-safety-labs-conjecture?commentId=sLAsecWijE84buriw\">suggested</a> that we were being unfair, because Conjecture is pursuing a hits-based research agenda, and this style of research typically takes a while to bear fruit: researchers might \u2018miss\u2019 many times before they \u2018hit\u2019.</p><p>To avoid misunderstanding, we want to lay out our stance on hits-based research agendas. We\u2019d like&nbsp;to see the TAIS community pursue diverse research agendas, including both hits-based agendas and other types. Existing hits-based agendas we are impressed by include \u2018<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/qHCDysDnvhteW7kRd/arc-s-first-technical-report-eliciting-latent-knowledge\"><u>Eliciting Latent Knowledge</u></a> and some work on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.14111\"><u>Goal Misgeneralization</u></a>. These respectively provided conceptual clarity to a previously confused concept, and provided an empirical demonstration of a previously largely theoretical concern.</p><p>To us, a strong hits-based research agenda involves investigating an issue in enough depth to properly evaluate it, at least in broad strokes. We\u2019d be excited by hits-based agendas that produced rigorous negative results, since this could save future researchers from going down dead ends. In our opinion, Conjecture\u2019s version of hits-based research does not meet this standard.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gkfMLX4NWZdmpikto/critiques-of-prominent-ai-safety-labs-conjecture#Initial_research_agenda__March_2022___Nov_2022_\"><u>As we discussed in our post,</u></a> representative examples of research were highly exploratory, with limited empirical evidence. Since the hypotheses of this work are often unclear, the research is not easy to engage with or critique.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, we believe that for organizations of the scale we consider (&gt;$10 mn in funding), their track record should be meaningful even under a hits-based view. $10 mn is enough to fund 33 person-years of work at a generous per-employee cost of $300k/year: more than enough to test out a variety of approaches. By contrast,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ycombinator.com/library/4A-a-guide-to-seed-fundraising#part3\"><u>typical seed rounds</u></a> for startups are between $0.5 to $1.5 mn. If $10 mn is insufficient to produce a hit, we would take this as strong evidence that either the organization scaled up too rapidly behind an unproven agenda, or pursued several approaches all of which failed. Both of these constitute significant negative updates in our view.&nbsp;</p><p>It is of course conceivable that even highly capable researchers pursuing very ambitious agendas might repeatedly fail, but we would usually expect them to fail in&nbsp;interesting ways that clarify the research landscape.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, in a world of limited funding and talent it is impractical to give an organization unlimited benefit of the doubt. Although this apporach may result in some false negatives, is this cost in expectation greater than what could otherwise be achieved with these resources? For example, funders often make bets on independent researchers for a year-long period, only renewing the grant if the results are strong. Some independent researchers might have succeeded had they been given another year \u2013 but that does not necessarily mean we should fund half as many independent researchers for twice as long.</p><h1>What are our evaluations based on?</h1><p>Our evaluations are based on several sources of data. Public sources include p<strong>ublished research, news articles and interviews</strong>; private sources include&nbsp;<strong>discussions with employees and other well-informed people, and personal observations.</strong></p><p>Where possible, we\u2019ll link to public sources to back up our points. However, some of our critiques will rely on private discussions and observations. We will cite our sources when they consent to this; where they\u2019ve asked to remain anonymous, we will provide as much context as possible about their experience, role and other facts, to help readers judge the source\u2019s reliability for themselves. Unfortunately, where we are the primary source, we are often unable to cite ourselves, as this would risk de-anonymizing us.&nbsp;</p><p>We believe that our sources have high integrity. We acknowledge that some of our opinions are based on personal trust, but we still believe that it\u2019s worth bringing these issues to light.&nbsp;<strong>If you are making important decisions related to the organizations we critique, we encourage you to speak to people you trust and draw your own conclusions</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>We share drafts of our posts with TAIS researchers and EA community members who may disagree with our views, have different perspectives to us and/or have strong epistemics.&nbsp;<strong>If you'd like to review drafts of our posts, please </strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/N4LKrktopDs5Qdqgn/critiques-of-prominent-ai-safety-organizations-introduction#Contact_Us\"><strong>reach out</strong></a><strong>.</strong> We also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kjcMZEzksusCHfHiF/productive-criticism-running-a-draft-past-the-people-you-re\"><u>share drafts with the organizations we are critiquing</u></a> prior to publication with a request for feedback.&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>How will we engage with discussion on our posts?</strong></h1><p>We strive to engage with most people who leave comments on our posts.

This assumption is typically treated as a methodological starting point, rather than as following from any particular moral or political theory. In this paper, I challenge this assumption. To frame my discussion, I argue, first, that justice doesn\u2019t in principle override beneficence, and second, that justice doesn\u2019t typically outweigh beneficence, since, in institutional contexts, the stakes of beneficence are often extremely high. While there are various ways one might resist this argument, none challenge the core methodological point that political philosophy should abandon its preoccupation with justice and begin to pay considerably more attention to social beneficence\u2014that is, to beneficence understood as a virtue of social institutions. Along the way, I also highlight areas where focusing on social beneficence would lead political philosophers in new and fruitful directions, and where normative ethicists focused on personal beneficence might scale up their thinking to the institutional case.</p><h2>I.</h2><p><i>&nbsp;Justice is the first virtue of social institutions, as truth is of systems of thought. A theory however elegant and economical must be rejected or revised if it is untrue; likewise laws and institutions no matter how efficient and well-arranged must be reformed or abolished if they are unjust\u2026 The only thing that permits us to acquiesce in an erroneous theory is the lack of a better one; analogously, an injustice is tolerable only when it is necessary to avoid an even greater injustice. Being first virtues of human activities, truth and justice are uncompromising. These propositions seem to express our intuitive conviction of the primacy of justice. No doubt they are expressed too strongly.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\u2014John Rawls, <i>A Theory of Justice</i>, 4</p><p>A background assumption in much contemporary political philosophy is that justice takes priority over beneficence. When evaluating social and political institutions, or thinking through questions of institutional design or reform, we should focus primarily on justice. This assumption is often associated with various further ideas, such as that justice but not beneficence is enforceable, that justice but not beneficence concerns rights, or that justice involves perfect duties but beneficence only imperfect ones. It is also typically assumed that justice is institutional, while beneficence is personal. There is much talk of social justice, and some talk of justice as a personal virtue, but, for the most part, we talk only of personal beneficence\u2014not social beneficence.</p><p>This phenomenon extends beyond the academy. A similar concern with justice permeates our political discourse. Justice operates as a conversation stopper. If the status quo is unjust, this is taken as an almost conclusive argument against the status quo; if some policy promotes justice, this is taken as an almost conclusive argument in favor of the policy. In both political philosophy and everyday political discourse, we do, of course, recognize exceptions to this rule. In the face of a serious disaster, we may need to override justice\u2014we shouldn\u2019t really let justice be done though the heavens fall. But these exceptions are generally assumed to be rare\u2014the heavens are only seldom falling. For the most part, then, contemporary political philosophy and discourse follows John Rawls\u2019s statement in the above epigraph. It operates with an \u201cintuitive conviction of the primacy of justice,\u201d albeit, one that is sometimes \u201cexpressed too strongly.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvqkf3ct8j6r\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvqkf3ct8j6r\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>There are, again, some exceptions. Political realists in the tradition of Bernard Williams claim that we should focus more on legitimacy.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwaimxmp88lq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwaimxmp88lq\">[2]</a></sup></span>G. A. Cohen argues that justice must be traded off against other values, such as liberty and efficiency.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefn5ttve5zth\"><sup><a href=\"#fnn5ttve5zth\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Yet this time, too, the exceptions are rare. Mainstream political philosophy, and mainstream political discourse, is obsessed with justice. But don\u2019t take it from me. As Laura Valentini puts it in criticizing Cohen\u2019s position:</p><p><i>Principles of justice are typically seen as particularly stringent, and as giving rise to rights. To say that something is a matter of justice is to make a particularly weighty normative assertion. If this is correct, arguably the Cohenite approach has the defect of depriving justice of its special interest and importance. If justice is only one value among many \u2013 with no special normative, rights-generating, status \u2013 then why obsess so much about it?</i><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefaa5eiylbqqs\"><sup><a href=\"#fnaa5eiylbqqs\">[4]</a></sup></span></p><p>Why, indeed?</p><p>My goal in this paper is to argue that political philosophy should abandon its preoccupation with justice and begin to pay considerably more attention to social beneficence\u2014that is, to beneficence understood as a virtue of social institutions. Since the main source of resistance to this claim is likely to be the thesis that (social) justice takes priority over (social) beneficence, I frame my discussion around a refutation of this thesis\u2014first by arguing, in Part II, that justice doesn\u2019t in principle override beneficence, and then by arguing, in Part III, that justice doesn\u2019t typically outweigh beneficence. Although defenders of the priority of justice might respond at various points by appeal to stipulative definitions of \u201cjustice\u201d or \u201cbeneficence,\u201d to atypically expansive theories of justice, or to certain controversial moral claims, a running theme is that no such response\u2014even if successful\u2014challenges my claim that political philosophy must focus more on social beneficence because it can\u2019t assume the priority of justice as a methodological starting point. Specifically, considerations paradigmatically associated with justice don\u2019t override considerations paradigmatically associated with beneficence, and determining what justice requires doesn\u2019t settle which institutions are justified in domains where justice and beneficence potentially conflict. Along the way, I also highlight areas where focusing on social beneficence would lead political philosophers in new and fruitful directions, and where normative ethicists focused on personal beneficence might scale up their thinking to the institutional case.</p><p>One limitation of my discussion is that I am concerned with the \u201cjustification\u201d of institutions\u2014with which institutions we should construct or maintain\u2014as opposed to their \u201clegitimacy\u201d or \u201cauthority\u201d\u2014with who should decide which institutions we have, or when they rightfully command compliance.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkzfzrzbo3js\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkzfzrzbo3js\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;A related limitation is that I focus on first-order questions about when institutions are justified, rather than second-order questions about how to proceed given disagreements about first-order questions\u2014although I briefly return to such issues in Part IV. Throughout, I treat beneficence as equivalent to charity, humanitarianism, or the portion of morality that utilitarians, say, believe is all of morality. The personally beneficent person promotes the good of others, or welfare more generally. Socially beneficent institutions do the same.</p><h3><a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/jacob-barrett-social-beneficence-global-priorities-institute-university-of-oxford/\">Read the rest of the paper</a></h3><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnvqkf3ct8j6r\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefvqkf3ct8j6r\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>John Rawls, <i>A Theory of Justice</i> (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1999), 4.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnwaimxmp88lq\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefwaimxmp88lq\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Bernard Williams,<i> In The Beginning was the Deed</i> (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2005).
