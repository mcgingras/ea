I have been thinking about writing an EAF post titled: \"EA is not special, nor should it be\". I have been thinking about this because a couple of months ago I was walking with my best friend, explaining to him for the first time what EA was. After my 5 minute intro he goes: \"But does not everyone do that? I mean, they should think about effectiveness and all that! It is the only sensible thing to do.\"<br><br>I think we can bring in a lot more people by reframing EA as being more about \"Doing good together\" rather than the current, a bit esoteric amalgamation of unusual ideas. To me, what is truly special about EA is that we together figure out how each one of us can have the most impact. My non-EA friends who want to make the world better (of which there are many!) do not collaborate much or seek advice on how they can have the most impact. I think this, at the core, is what sets EA apart. Neglectedness, tractability and importance is something that should not be weird and that most people will subscribe to. Perhaps counterfactual impact is also a bit unique, but I do not think we should lead so heavily with that. In fact, has my friends collaborated more when thinking about how to do good, I am pretty sure they too would have identified counterfactual impact.&nbsp;</p><p>EA, to me, is more like a \"community career service\".</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Ulrik Horn"}}, {"_id": "YiGHKeXb87Dc8sjum", "postedAt": "2023-12-01T18:40:31.683Z", "postId": "89GdH5unSb2Sze6kj", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>\"But does not everyone do that?

Everything else (the social and professional communities, the effective methods, the moral obligation, etc.) flows from universalist utilitarianism, usually of the hedonic / suffering minimization kind (although the specific forms can differ slightly). If that\u2019s not there, and if you\u2019re coming from a totally different philosophical perspective (e.g., virtue ethics, some form of deontology not rooted in observable reality, etc.), to me it\u2019s hard to call this EA.
