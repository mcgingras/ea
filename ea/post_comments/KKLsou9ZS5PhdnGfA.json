Thus, there is strong support for the second premise. The actions an individual can take to reduce the carbon emissions of his consumption habits are simple and at little cost to the individual. These actions include switching off electrical appliances when not in use, using fans instead of air-conditioners, switching off water taps when brushing teeth and air-drying clothes in the sun instead of using a dryer.</p></blockquote><p>I think if you actually attempted to do these calculations rather than just gesturing at you would not get such a large impact. Suggesting that a single person making lifestyle adjustments 'is literally saving not one but many children' (though they are only 'at risk'?) seems like a dramatic overestimate to me. It seems basically impossible for this to be the case given that you are a very small fraction of the total population and a small fraction of carbon emissions.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Larks"}}, {"_id": "ng522vEaqPBiZ7geb", "postedAt": "2024-02-21T09:54:05.563Z", "postId": "KKLsou9ZS5PhdnGfA", "htmlBody": "<p><a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-24487-w\">This paper</a> I read a few years ago gives an estimate for the mortality cost of carbon emissions.
