For us, if possible (min weight and min iron levels met plus the other requirements), it is more efficient to do a \"double red\" donation. That is where we donate only our red blood cells. Our plasma is returned to us. It takes a little longer but is done less frequently. The recovery is a bit longer too, but regarding exercise it mostly just impacts your VO2Max, not your endurance or your strength. That's because you just have less Oxygen circulating, obviously, since you have fewer red blood cells. It takes about 2-4 weeks to rebuild those blood cells. Just want to share this possibility since it would reduce your travel time, your total donation time, and likely also your recovery time. Plus, it is the absolute most efficient use of OUR blood type.
