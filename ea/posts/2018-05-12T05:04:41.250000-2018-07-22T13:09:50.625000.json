The amendment, named after its <a href=\"https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/ez8a44/a-short-history-of-congressman-steve-king-saying-racist-shit\"><u>odious</u></a> author Rep. Steve King (R-IA), won the support of farm state Republicans, who <a href=\"https://www.c-span.org/video/?444212-3/farm-bill-markup-part-2\"><u>voted</u></a> to insert&nbsp;it into the must-pass once-every-five-years farm bill. And although the farm bill was defeated last week \u2014 for <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2018/5/18/17368178/farm-bill-2018-fails-immigration-daca-house\"><u>reasons</u></a> unrelated to King\u2019s amendment \u2014 the House is likely to reconsider it <a href=\"https://www.agriculture.com/news/business/house-sets-new-vote-on-farm-bill\"><u>by June 22</u></a>.</p><p>So what\u2019s going on and what can we do about it?</p><h1>The backstory: Advocates make progress</h1><p>Since 2002, <a href=\"https://us14.campaign-archive.com/?u=66df320da8400b581cbc1b539&amp;id=7c0d8efb5e\"><u>advocates have helped enact</u></a> bans on gestation crates for pigs, veal crates for calves, or battery cages for hens in Florida (2002), Arizona (2006), California (2008), Colorado (2008), Maine (2009), Michigan (2009), Ohio (2010), Rhode Island (2012), and Massachusetts (2016). In most states the bans affected industries \u2014 typically veal or pork \u2014 that were barely present in the states. But in California and Michigan, the bans affected egg industries with <a href=\"https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/erbe/2008/10/14/california-animal-cruelty-could-be-cured-by-proposition-2\"><u>19M</u></a> and <a href=\"http://www.mipoultry.com/eggs/\"><u>15M</u></a> hens respectively, which now feared cheaper egg imports from states that lacked any standards.</p><p>That led the California egg industry in 2010 to push for a <a href=\"http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=200920100AB1437\"><u>law</u></a>&nbsp;extending the state\u2019s new ban on cramped cages to all shell eggs sold in the state, included imported ones. (California\u2019s 2008 measure, Prop 2, sought to ban battery cages entirely, but regulators interpreted its text to only require larger cages: <a href=\"https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/ahfss/mpes/pdfs/EggSafetyRule.pdf\"><u>116 sq. inches</u></a> per bird, vs. the industry standard of <a href=\"https://uepcertified.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/2017-UEP-Animal-Welfare-Guidelines-Cage-Housing-6.2017-FINAL.pdf\"><u>67 sq. inches</u></a>; cage-free hens get <a href=\"https://uepcertified.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017-UEP-Animal-Welfare-Cage-Free-Guidelines-11.01.2017-FINAL.pdf\"><u>144-216 sq. inches</u></a> plus perches and nesting boxes.) This opened up a new strategy for advocates, who can more easily enact legislation in the liberal states that consume half of America's factory farmed meat and eggs than in the <a href=\"https://www.factoryfarmmap.org/#animal:all;location:US;year:2012\"><u>mostly conservative states</u></a> that produce them.</p><p>In 2016 advocates took up the strategy in Massachusetts, advancing a ballot measure that barred the sale of eggs, pork, or veal from caged animals, including imported products. After <a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Massachusetts_Minimum_Size_Requirements_for_Farm_Animal_Containment,_Question_3_(2016)\"><u>78%</u></a> of Bay Staters approved the measure, advocates moved back to California to enact a copycat measure. Last month, they finished collecting <a href=\"https://www.livekindly.co/600000-californians-historic-farm-animal-protection-legislation-ballot/\"><u>600K signatures</u></a>, more than enough to get on the November 2018 California ballot.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b721336cf8135e1f994ea2adbbd7988f5da3cbe24d789656.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b721336cf8135e1f994ea2adbbd7988f5da3cbe24d789656.png/w_151 151w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b721336cf8135e1f994ea2adbbd7988f5da3cbe24d789656.png/w_231 231w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b721336cf8135e1f994ea2adbbd7988f5da3cbe24d789656.png/w_311 311w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b721336cf8135e1f994ea2adbbd7988f5da3cbe24d789656.png/w_391 391w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/b721336cf8135e1f994ea2adbbd7988f5da3cbe24d789656.png/w_471 471w\"><figcaption><i>12 states have partial or full bans on battery cages, gestation crates, or veal crates in 12 US states.

In 2013, he put an amendment in the House farm bill barring any \u201cstate or locality\u201d from \u201cimpos[ing] a standard or condition\u201d on how an imported agricultural product is produced \u201cin addition\u201d to federal standards or those in the state where it was produced. Since neither the federal government nor major factory farming states have <i>any</i> farm animal welfare standards, under King\u2019s amendment&nbsp;any standards like California\u2019s would be&nbsp;\u201caddition[al]\u201d and thus void. (The Harvard Animal Law program prepared an excellent <a href=\"http://animal.law.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/HLS-PICA-Index-of-Laws.pdf\"><u>report</u></a> on the many other state laws that King\u2019s amendment could accidentally preempt.)</p><p>In 2013, the conference committee reconciling the divergent Senate and House versions of the farm bill knocked out King\u2019s amendment. This was likely thanks to Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-MI), then Chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), both animal-friendly legislators whose states\u2019 egg industries opposed the amendment. Since then, the Senate has flipped and the less sympathetic Sen. Pat Roberts (R-KS) now holds Stabenow\u2019s position.</p><p>Meanwhile, 13 factory farming states have <a href=\"https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/INAG/2017/12/11/file_attachments/927879/Combined%2Bfiles%2Bpdfa%2Bcompliant.pdf\"><u>sued</u></a> California and Massachusetts, arguing their laws violate the Commerce and Supremacy Clauses of the US Constitution.

King on Family Farm Action\u2019s </i><a href=\"http://stopkingsattack.com/\"><i><u>coalition website</u></i></a><i>&nbsp;opposing the King Amendment.</i></figcaption></figure><h1>Round II: Defeating King's Amendment</h1><p>So what can we do? The immediate priority is to prevent the Senate Agriculture Committee from adding King\u2019s amendment to their version of the farm bill, which is likely to be marked up in the <a href=\"http://whotv.com/2018/05/25/senate-farm-bill-set-for-june/\"><u>next three weeks</u></a>. Animal advocates have little sway over whether the House will pass the farm bill, since this&nbsp;<a href=\"http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2018/05/immigration-farm-bill-tangle-ensnares-ryan-and-gop-unity.html\"><u>depends mainly</u></a> on immigration. But they can ensure that if the House fails to pass this farm bill again, the next farm bill&nbsp;doesn\u2019t contain King\u2019s language.</p><p>To do that, advocates need to help mobilize Republican opposition to the amendment. Democrats have only 20 of the 46 seats in the House Agriculture Committee and 10 of the 21 seats in the Senate Agriculture Committee, so even if they all opposed the amendment (<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/3599/cosponsors?q=%7B%22party%22%3A%22Democratic%22%7D\"><u>they don\u2019t</u></a>) they couldn\u2019t defeat it alone. Thankfully, some Republicans do oppose the amendment, including the Koch-funded <a href=\"http://www.savestatesrights.com/\"><u>FreedomWorks</u></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bKXCrgjx63NQRusV614w8F8o98l7ol1i/view?usp=sharing\"><u>17 Republican representatives</u></a> led by Rep. Jeff Denham (R-CA).</p><p>Longer-term, advocates need to build the bipartisan political power to effectively oppose such legislation&nbsp;\u2014 and ultimately to enact legal protections for farm animals. They could look to the examples of effective lobbies, like the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (<a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2014/09/01/friends-israel\"><u>profile</u></a>), National Rifle Association (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/24/us/politics/nra-gun-control-florida.html\"><u>profile</u></a>), or even the American Farm Bureau (<a href=\"http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/08/19/cq/farm.html\"><u>article</u></a>), all of which have coupled grassroots organizing in key congressional districts with targeted campaign contributions (in many cases pushing for policies we oppose). I hope to write more on this topic in future.</p><p>Your next newsletter will come from my new colleague, Amanda Hungerford, who will explore the current state of animal slaughter and what we can do to reform it.</p><hr><p>P.S.: Congress is also considering&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.house.gov/meetings/AP/AP00/20180516/108312/BILLS-115HR-FC-AP-FY2019-AP00-Final.pdf\"><u>language</u></a>,&nbsp;which&nbsp;a House committee added to&nbsp;to the annual bill funding the USDA, that directs the agency to regulate the future sale of clean meat.

I\u2019m not sure, and don\u2019t want to write on this until I better understand their viewpoint. Either way, the Senate parallel bill does not contain similar language, so it will be to&nbsp;the conference committee whether the language becomes law.

The rest of her life is 135,360 times that length. That means, according to this argument, that for slaughter to be a worthy focus, a chicken\u2019s death must be 135,360 times worse than her life on the farm.</p><p>Slaughter may well be that much worse than life on the farm \u2014 thoughtful people <a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/why-i-support-the-humane-slaughter-association/#Intensity_of_suffering_during_slaughter\"><u>have argued</u></a> that a significant proportion of the suffering farm animals endure occurs during slaughter. &nbsp;But the truth is we don\u2019t really know how to meaningfully compare acute and chronic suffering. &nbsp;People use the same hypotheticals to arrive at opposite conclusions. I\u2019ve heard people argue, with equal passion, \u201cI would, of course, endure being boiled alive in exchange for avoiding a lifetime in a cage,\u201d and \u201cI would, of course, be willing to spend a lifetime in a cage to avoid being boiled alive.\u201d &nbsp;But almost none of us have lived experiences that make these hypotheticals more than guesswork.</p><p>One value in focusing on reforming slaughter is that it should be relatively achievable, and represents a low-hanging fruit. &nbsp;The industry has already engaged in slaughter reform before. In the late 90s, in response to a PR scandal, McDonald\u2019s hired animal welfare scientist Temple Grandin to help them reform their cattle slaughter processes. &nbsp;Grandin designed \u2014 and most cattle slaughterhouses implemented \u2014 improvements such as <a href=\"https://www.nationalgeographic.com/people-and-culture/food/the-plate/2015/08/19/temple-grandin-killing-them-softly-at-slaughterhouses-for-30-years/\"><u>curved chutes and center-track restrainers</u></a>. &nbsp;Curved chutes move cattle forward while keeping them calmer, which helps reduce the number of injuries they suffer. &nbsp;Center-track restrainers hold cattle still, so that handlers can stun them more effectively, and reduce the likelihood of conscious slaughter. &nbsp;</p><p>The industry has incorporated some improvements in poultry. &nbsp;Already, a <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4693211/\"><u>fifth</u></a> of European birds are slaughtered via CAS, as are most American turkeys. &nbsp;Companies like <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/06/28/this-could-be-the-start-to-a-whole-new-world-of-chicken/?utm_term=.fbe3f2ee5f87\"><u>KFC Canada</u></a> and <a href=\"http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-mcdonalds-chicken-20171027-story.html\"><u>McDonald\u2019s USA</u></a> have already announced that they will exclusively buy CAS-stunned birds. &nbsp;Similarly, <a href=\"http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-perdue-chicken-killing-process-20160629-story.html\"><u>Perdue</u></a> has announced it will implement CAS-stunning at its facilities. &nbsp;Corporations\u2019 previous willingness to implement slaughter reform gives reason to believe they might be willing to do it again, on a widespread scale.</p><p>This begs the question of why any advocacy effort needs to be directed at slaughter. &nbsp;Why haven\u2019t better alternatives caught on more widely? Mostly the answers seem to be inertia and capital costs. &nbsp;Most stunning systems have long lifespans (sometimes <a href=\"https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/animals/docs/aw_practice_slaughter_study_stunning_poultry_en.pdf\"><u>&gt;25 years</u></a>) meaning they don\u2019t need to be changed often, and a new broiler CAS system can cost more than <a href=\"http://www.meatpoultry.com/Writers/Other-Contributors/Cargill-knows-turkey.aspx?page=3\"><u>$10M</u></a>. &nbsp;Given that few consumers are informed enough to ask about stunning methods, there\u2019s been little pressure to change \u2014 a few years ago Cargill <a href=\"http://www.meatpoultry.com/Writers/Other-Contributors/Cargill-knows-turkey.aspx?page=3\"><u>called</u></a> CAS \u201ca significant investment \u2026 with a minimal return.\u201d</p><p>Thankfully, the pressure is growing. &nbsp;A recent <a href=\"https://www.wattagnet.com/blogs/47-us-poultry-industry-insights/post/33650-controlled-atmosphere-stunning-the-way-of-the-future\"><u>survey</u></a> of US poultry producers found that most expect 10-49% of the industry to be using CAS by 2024, with another third thinking it will be &gt;50% of the industry \u2014 a trend driven largely by CAS\u2019 inclusion in the corporate broiler reform commitment advocates are seeking. &nbsp;Further, slaughter reform can have additional benefits that diminish the corporate pain of increased capital costs.

Today I'm going to be talking about force multipliers, and why you might try to be one. This is a big reason why I do what I do. I'm deeply bought into the ideology that you can really amplify the impact of some people who are trying to do things that resonate strongly with you, that you think are important cause areas to be working towards. Being a force multiplier to me personally is a very motivating aspect of my job.

It refers to a factor or a combination of factors that dramatically increase the effectiveness of a group, relative to what they'd be able to achieve without these factors. While the term comes from a military science backdrop, I think the general principle is applicable to pretty much anything. Wherever there's scope to achieve something collectively with coordinated effort, wherever a group of people is trying to achieve something that is useful, that they think is important to be done, a case can be made for optimizing that initiative and effort, and to amplify its impact. Force multiplication leads to better, more efficient functioning of whatever you are trying to push&nbsp;towards.</p><p>I think to drive the clarity of concept, it's important to look at this thing with respect to specific cases. We'll look at two cases: increasing the impact or the influence of a group, or increasing the impact of a single individual or thought leader. I think while doing one does not necessarily mean that you're not going to be using the same practices and principles that are going to be effective with the other, it's important to try and draw out the different types of personalities that are most effective at doing these two things, either amplifying the impact of a group or amplifying the impact of an&nbsp;individual.</p><p>And then I think the question that one needs to ask themselves is: how do you, with your boundedly-rational self, limited abilities, capabilities, time, and resources drive that intervention, drive effective interventions that amplify the impact of the group or the individual that you're trying to support or&nbsp;enable.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1Jo8w7EfeYogmOK4ewQmAm/a4c01d5089bd683504aea34745b7361d/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__1_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1Jo8w7EfeYogmOK4ewQmAm/a4c01d5089bd683504aea34745b7361d/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__1_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1Jo8w7EfeYogmOK4ewQmAm/a4c01d5089bd683504aea34745b7361d/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__1_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1Jo8w7EfeYogmOK4ewQmAm/a4c01d5089bd683504aea34745b7361d/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__1_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1Jo8w7EfeYogmOK4ewQmAm/a4c01d5089bd683504aea34745b7361d/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__1_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1Jo8w7EfeYogmOK4ewQmAm/a4c01d5089bd683504aea34745b7361d/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__1_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1Jo8w7EfeYogmOK4ewQmAm/a4c01d5089bd683504aea34745b7361d/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__1_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Here, I want to define and clarify the <i>value chain</i> of an organization, because I think in order to figure out where can you amplify impact, it's important to understand what is core to the promise that you bring to whoever you're trying to reach out to, whether with a product or a service or a piece of information that you want to put out there. And then how does your organization enable that core promise to be fulfilled or to be delivered? I think there's core value functions, and there's support value functions. But I'm going to try and take some examples and clarify this&nbsp;distinction.</p><p>Anything that is the actual promise of your organization, to whoever it's addressing or trying to reach out to is what I'd like to call the core value chain of your organization. If you're a financial technology company or you have a product that's finance related, personal finance related or corporate finance related, the actual product development, what that product is, what are the services and the perks that come bundled with it, and the sale of that product, getting that to the final end customer and the people who are responsible for making that sale, driving that P&amp;L. Those are the two core value functions of the&nbsp;organization.</p><p>And then these functions are supported by a whole host of other important functions that enable these core value functions to actually accomplish what they are trying to accomplish. Depending on the size and the scale of your organization and its requirements, there's legal, there's marketing, there's things that feed into the product development, there's things that impact the sales like the channels you use for marketing, etc. There's human resource management. There's financial management. Bits of your work could be outsourced to partners, so you could be working with a network of stakeholders who are collectively trying to do something managing that project. All these support functions are invariably consistent across organizations. These skills are also extremely fungible. They do come with overtones of specialization that you develop once you're working in a field, but a lot of this is general experience that's very transferable across organizations, especially organizations that are working in a specific field the way all the effective altruism organizations are. They have a methodology, they have a specific agenda they're trying to accomplish, and very similar methods of getting there,&nbsp;basically.</p><p>To take a different example, in a manufacturing setup, the shop floor, the factory where the manufacturing happens, the supply chain that gets the product from the shop floor to the end customer as well as, again, the function that makes the sales, that handles the targets month on month, quarter on quarter: these are the core value functions. In a research organization, your research is your core value output. And everything that supports it is the enabling function. I think it's important to look at an organization not just as valuable, as important, or as iconic as its core value functions, but also as a bundle of these functions that stand on top of solid foundations of support or enabling functions, that run the show, that make things&nbsp;happen.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1o5CFxSmw4QqMUIKw4MUGa/4ab966276406d16accc5ddf217e9afde/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__2_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1o5CFxSmw4QqMUIKw4MUGa/4ab966276406d16accc5ddf217e9afde/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__2_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1o5CFxSmw4QqMUIKw4MUGa/4ab966276406d16accc5ddf217e9afde/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__2_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1o5CFxSmw4QqMUIKw4MUGa/4ab966276406d16accc5ddf217e9afde/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__2_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1o5CFxSmw4QqMUIKw4MUGa/4ab966276406d16accc5ddf217e9afde/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__2_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1o5CFxSmw4QqMUIKw4MUGa/4ab966276406d16accc5ddf217e9afde/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__2_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1o5CFxSmw4QqMUIKw4MUGa/4ab966276406d16accc5ddf217e9afde/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__2_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>I want to talk a little bit about what you need to be effective. This is not a laundry list or an exhaustive list of what I think can be useful orientations to have, or a useful environment to have to be effective in a force multiplier role of sorts, where you can give yourself this task and come out feeling that you've achieved something meaningful. If you're trying to do this for an organization or a collection of individuals you need to, I think, have a systems mindset. You need to believe in the fact that developing scalable, robust, efficient systems creates systemic efficiencies, leading to a lot of mental bandwidth freed up, and a lot of interesting work opportunities for everyone. People don't necessarily need to be caught up doing a job which doesn't excite them, that's repetitive. People can get caught in ruts, but that doesn't need to happen if you build very scalable, robust systems and try and automate the tasks which are not cognitively very stimulating for&nbsp;anyone.</p><p>Having said that, at times your predicament is such that you're nested within a broader system which is out of your control. Like for FHI, we're nested within Oxford University, so we use their systems and processes, and we have to tie in whatever we develop into those pre-existing systems. At times you might be dealing with policy offices, a lot of government interaction, and they have a certain way, a methodology, and unsaid norms that you have to follow. You could be dealing within a microcosm or a macrocosm, which could be restrictive, or you could have all the bandwidth and the elbow room to do whatever you think is most efficient. But basically, you want to have a mindset that anything that's not cognitively interesting should be somewhat automated, somewhat made free of the dependence on any one&nbsp;individual.</p><p>You need to have the mindset of problem solving. You are going to be bombarded with a bunch of problems that are new, that you haven't anticipated before, challenges that come because the environment in which you operate changes, or the policy guidelines that impact your organization and your output change. Within this very dynamic landscape you need to be prepared for failure. You need to be able to anticipate future problems and attack them. That's not to say that you're always going to be prepared for anything that might be thrown your way. You're definitely going to get caught off guard many times. But it's good to have the mindset of knowing that, yes, things are going to break. It's going to be challenging. To know you haven't thought through something, but I'm ready to probably respond to it. It's important to know you're agile enough as an organization, having your systems in place, but still having the ability to, with agility, respond to problems that you haven't sort of anticipated&nbsp;before.</p><p>I think when you're trying to be a force multiplier for a group of people, an organization, there needs to be a buy-in from the organization. Between a team that's providing an enablement service and the team that's trying to achieve the core objective within an organization, there needs to be an implicit understanding of what is the service level agreement that you're willing to sign on for. How much work will the operations team commit to doing? How much mind space are they committing to free up for other people? How much is the core objective team going to share the load in terms of doing some bits and meeting the ops team midway? Every organization, because of the environment in which it operates in, the legacy systems it has, the place it wants to get to, has an implicit, tacit understanding of how all this will be handled. So getting buy-in there, having the authority to implement that and reinforce uptake of these processes that you set in place, I think that's an important thing to focus on and drive clarity on when you're working in a set-up like&nbsp;this.</p><p>And then of course all of this happens with teamwork. Whenever you're trying to support a group of individuals, if it's 12 to 15 people then a couple of people can do an effective job at taking care of all of their needs. It's a really challenging situation, a huge learning opportunity for those two people, but they'll be able to provide the enablement that's needed. But when your organization scales up to 50, 100, 150, it changes. Plus 500, it becomes a different game altogether. So developing solutions that scale up, that break with grace, that don't sort of crumble under pressure of scale up and change. Those are sort of important things that you need to keep focusing on, and that help make you an effective force multiplier for a&nbsp;group.</p><p>What do you do for an individual? I think the ability to model someone's preferences effectively to see what they need, what information they are usually looking for when they're trying to assess whether to commit to a situation or not, what kinds of questions they're invariably going to ask you, what information you need to pre collect or assess, and how best to distill that information. All these things help you develop a model of the person that you're working with, working for, whose impact you're trying to amplify. You get feedback on the model, in a sense. You see whether your predictions are accurate, inaccurate, how can you refine them, fine tune them a little more. I think that's where you&nbsp;start.</p><p>It's interesting because I was talking to Nick about my presentation, and he said, \"Well, there's a level zero, which is basic support and general competence and how he said that was, 'not making a mess of things,'\" so not going and mucking everything up is also extremely important. It starts there, and then you develop a bit of a rapport. You develop a model for the preferences of the person you're trying to work with. And you feed that information back to them. I think that's where the importance of preference modeling lies. You give them the confidence that you're doing a decent job at accurately representing their beliefs, accurately representing their requests and requirements, so that they start delegating more things to you. Getting that authority, taking that cognitive load off their plate, giving them more time to engage in things that ostensibly they should be doing, that they're much better at doing. I think that's where real value is uncovered in, when you're trying to support an effective altruist leader of sorts, or a thought leader who you really want to amplify the impact&nbsp;of.</p><p>I think at the third level you start developing complementary skills, things that are needed. So if you're supporting someone who's writing a book, you would be able to add a lot of value by understanding what are the best ways of digitally marketing a product in today's world. You don't necessarily have to build all the skills yourself, but you need to have enough subject matter knowledge in order to work with experts, in order to collaborate with people you hire on retainer or people you hire for a one time project to do any of these things. If the person that you're aligned to is not a great networker but could benefit a lot from meeting certain individuals, being part of some conversations, then how do you in your capacity enable and facilitate those meetings, those connections? And if you're not good at it, how do you leverage the network around you in order to achieve that end outcome? I think that becomes the level three of operating while being the force multiplier for an&nbsp;individual.</p><p>And then I think there are some things that get unlocked. There are levels that get unlocked only after long-term association, after a lot of trust has been built, after a lot of challenges, situations have been conquered, observed together, the problems that you face together. And then after that, not only the person you're aligned to and yourself, but other people start seeing you as a credible proxy who can stand in for that person's judgment, for that person's viewpoint on something. And I think that's where you truly free up a lot of mind space, a lot of long-term impact opportunities, that are unlocked when you reach that&nbsp;stage.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5aOg13JSXuem8sYKmmwO8I/26b65cfe3c7259b13cd2aca453057ac3/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__3_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5aOg13JSXuem8sYKmmwO8I/26b65cfe3c7259b13cd2aca453057ac3/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__3_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5aOg13JSXuem8sYKmmwO8I/26b65cfe3c7259b13cd2aca453057ac3/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__3_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5aOg13JSXuem8sYKmmwO8I/26b65cfe3c7259b13cd2aca453057ac3/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__3_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5aOg13JSXuem8sYKmmwO8I/26b65cfe3c7259b13cd2aca453057ac3/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__3_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5aOg13JSXuem8sYKmmwO8I/26b65cfe3c7259b13cd2aca453057ac3/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__3_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5aOg13JSXuem8sYKmmwO8I/26b65cfe3c7259b13cd2aca453057ac3/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__3_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>I also want to call focus on some critical features for a person to have, who's trying to be an effective force multiplier. I think if they have these things, they're poised for more success than they would have without them. Again, this is not exhaustive. 80,000 Hours' ops post has a whole section on the mindset, the skills that you'll want to be calling out for, focused on, holding, et cetera. I'd recommend everyone read&nbsp;that.</p><p>I think value alignment or mission focus to me is something that's extremely important for an operations person, or for a person who's trying to amplify the impact of an ideology in the world. This is not to say that value aligned people have it easy, or that it's all fun and games and excitement. Your job can get really hard at times, and it can get really challenging. But if you're value aligned, and you're deeply bought into the mindset and the ideology, then the challenges and the failures and the setbacks won't lead you to question your life choices, in the sense they'll still hurt, and they'll feel bad, and you'll be driven to improve all the good things that will come out of it. But you will not feel, \"Should I be doing this? Should I be doing something else?\" I think that whole element goes away, and it leads to lasting satisfaction. So I cannot stress the importance of this&nbsp;more.</p><p>The drive to upskill and learn. There needs to be some people in the organization, or any movement, who are ready to chew on glass. And I don't know how to more delicately put this, but there are things that not everyone wants to do. But some people need to be committed to doing those things in order to make sure that important things happen. The movement gets the wind it needs beneath its wings because there are people who are doing the not so glamorous but super important&nbsp;things.</p><p>I thought a bit about how to position this vicarious orientation that I want to point out. For a community that cares about aligned artificial general intelligence, not everyone can be an AI safety researcher. It's not even effective if everyone is an AI safety researcher. So there need to be people who know that, \"Okay, my strength is networking or my strength is project management or my strength is putting together great events like this where people can come together and actually talk.\" So playing to your strengths, identifying where you can contribute, where you can have the maximal impact, and committing to do that while knowing that you're freeing up time, mind space, energy of people who are really good at solving the kinds of problems that you're worried about. I think that sort of an orientation helps. Looking at things like that is useful when you're trying to be a force&nbsp;multiplier.</p><p>And then whether you're a team player or you're an individual contributor, however you see your strengths, I think there's a place for you if you are trying to support a team of 10s of people, you're part of a tightly knit unit that's committed to providing a certain level of service across all the processes that people have to engage in. Your responsibilities are divided among three, four people of a team. It's a team effort, which fails together and succeeds together. So I think if you're a bit of a team player, which is a very useful important orientation to have when you're trying to support an organization, trying to be a force multiplier, trying to commit to a cause, trying to commit to doing things that are sort of non-glamorous, then there's a place for you&nbsp;there.</p><p>If you're an individual contributor, you sort of thrive a little more if you're given more elbow room to flourish and explore things, which is not to say that you don't have to have the skill, the ability to manage relationships and communicate effectively with a lot of people. Those are hygiene skills that everyone needs. But if you need a bit more elbow room to flourish, then trying to explore opportunities for being a project manager, a personal assistant, an executive assistant to some high impact individual is, I think, something that you would find very&nbsp;interesting.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4mq6Hg9eIUuc0GSImw2ESA/4cb75f1d7ceae748e169841136a7a295/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__4_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4mq6Hg9eIUuc0GSImw2ESA/4cb75f1d7ceae748e169841136a7a295/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__4_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4mq6Hg9eIUuc0GSImw2ESA/4cb75f1d7ceae748e169841136a7a295/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__4_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4mq6Hg9eIUuc0GSImw2ESA/4cb75f1d7ceae748e169841136a7a295/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__4_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4mq6Hg9eIUuc0GSImw2ESA/4cb75f1d7ceae748e169841136a7a295/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__4_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4mq6Hg9eIUuc0GSImw2ESA/4cb75f1d7ceae748e169841136a7a295/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__4_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4mq6Hg9eIUuc0GSImw2ESA/4cb75f1d7ceae748e169841136a7a295/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__4_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Lastly, I want to talk a little bit about what do you gain from this experience? I think the biggest thing you'll gain by supporting an organization, trying to amplify their impact, is how to run an organization. Like, how to run complex projects with multiple stakeholders, how to firefight things that you haven't anticipated, that you're not prepared to deal with, and that's a very useful skill in movement building, organization building, trying to accomplish something where a lot of people with different levels of buy-in, different levels of commitment to different things that are important to the cause come&nbsp;together.</p><p>Navigating those complex waters is a very important skill that you get to hone and develop wholly. You develop a great understanding of the lay of the land that you're dealing with. You get connected to all the important people. These are small communities, a few people coming together to do all sorts of interesting and important things. They send leads, whether it's media engagement leads or leads of other policy makers along each other's ways, so you get to interact with everyone who is important in the community, build your network, see how you can facilitate these interactions given your strengths and your understanding of the&nbsp;field.</p><p>And then you get to develop your career capital by focusing, if you're interested, either in specialist skills, figuring out how best to give grants, how best to put up events of this scale and nature, or double clicking on marketing. Whatever interests you, or you can keep developing these broad generalist skills of people who are effective at running organizations, complex movements, helping facilitate communication and growth of the whole&nbsp;community.</p><p>Analogously, when you're talking about doing this for an individual, you get to model an effective altruist leader, and you get to be their sidekick. And if the word sidekick is slightly offensive to you then substitute it with whatever you're excited by, but what I mean to say is that without having the actual responsibility on your head, you're living the life of someone who has all these amazing opportunities knocking at their doors all the time. The kind of things that you get exposed to are people wanting advice on what to do with their company, what to do with their funds and resources that they've unlocked. A lot of policymakers, government people, NGOs knock on your door trying to understand how would you react to a particular recent development in the&nbsp;field.</p><p>These are exciting times, and effective altruism is full of people who are extremely well reasoned, thoughtful thinkers who a lot of people want to listen to and get advice from. So there's a lot of opportunity to do very interesting stuff, and you're only limited by your own bandwidth, your capacity to commit to different types of projects and deep dive into them. Obviously you get to pick what you like. You get to identify niches for yourself where you're like, \"Maybe I want to develop this skill more. Maybe I already am good at it, and I can really make a difference to this project.\" So you get to pick the projects that you&nbsp;like.</p><p>Some people, Laura as an example, is doing amazing work with Will MacAskill. She's Will's project manager, and he gets a lot of requests for, \"Where should I invest my money?\" Or where to distribute these funds that we have in order to promote this sort of thinking in academia, building a systems mindset that we're thinking about for these cause areas. I think those are extremely interesting opportunities where she has to learn, she has to upskill, she has to talk to a lot of people, put herself out of her comfort zone quite periodically, and upskill in order to understand what's the best advice to feed to Will who has limited time, limited&nbsp;energy.</p><p>I think I've spoken a bit about this. You aid decision making. You can develop credible models for effective communication between these leaders, between the people that they're trying to reach, and the people who are trying to reach them. And you can truly, I think, have a huge impact in how you facilitate this whole process. I think it's important, this message that I'm leaving there, which I would like you to take in the spirit that it's intended. Highly impactful people or organizations always have a whole host of force multipliers behind the scenes. Any CEO has a group of people who make magic happen, from writing amazing speeches, to coordinating their traveling logistics very efficiently, to figuring out how should they spend their time, how should they bunch up their preferences, all of these&nbsp;things.</p><p>Areas of maximal contribution and impact that you can identify are, Kyle Scott has a list that he shared in the operations forum of people who do not have either executive assistants or research assistants or project managers, and who arguably should. They absolutely should. There are many people in the community who, if you can support, it will be a hugely impactful thing to be doing. All the operations roles that are open and that tend to stay open for a really long time until the time that some academic commits to doing them, until the time that we can find an ops person, and all those roles are extremely important. They need people who want to be doing these things and are excited about doing these things to be doing them. There are lots of opportunities if you want to try out, if you want to&nbsp;contribute.</p><p>It's not easy to do these things that should magically happen. It's also not non-rewarding. At times I've said things like this or at times I've heard in the heat of the moment you feel that, \"Is this rewarding? Should I be doing everything that other people arguably don't want to do or else they would've done it themselves?\" I think it can be super rewarding, because every day you're responsible for things. If you're the kind of person who likes knowing that being involved in a situation is actually leading to some positive impact, positive change, well, you will be in a lot of situations where you're the last person responsible for those things. It makes you responsible. It's hard because you're emotionally invested in what you're trying to do. You care deeply about the outcomes and the objectives that you're trying to achieve. And it's extremely challenging because you know the opportunity cost of failure. You know the trade-offs that you're trying to make and the research time that you lose, or the energy effort resources that you lose if you muck things&nbsp;up.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Zo0nE0VqgYAe88keyY6ms/986c5f0a2eb7558de15fdc1ebd236588/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__5_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Zo0nE0VqgYAe88keyY6ms/986c5f0a2eb7558de15fdc1ebd236588/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__5_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Zo0nE0VqgYAe88keyY6ms/986c5f0a2eb7558de15fdc1ebd236588/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__5_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Zo0nE0VqgYAe88keyY6ms/986c5f0a2eb7558de15fdc1ebd236588/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__5_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Zo0nE0VqgYAe88keyY6ms/986c5f0a2eb7558de15fdc1ebd236588/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__5_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Zo0nE0VqgYAe88keyY6ms/986c5f0a2eb7558de15fdc1ebd236588/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__5_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Zo0nE0VqgYAe88keyY6ms/986c5f0a2eb7558de15fdc1ebd236588/Force_multipliers__EAG_SF_2018__v2__5_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Being all this, it's also extremely awesome because you're in the eye of the storm. You're in the vortex where everything is happening and hopefully happening well. I think that our preference biases that everyone has for being on the forefront, being the icon, and I think this field has a little more of that. Like I've observed a lot of this orientation where everyone wants to be an icon in the field rather than being okay with being the sidekick. I think the movement can be turbo charged if there are people who understand that the forefront, or what you consider maximally impactful, is a bit of an illusion. The benefit of hindsight lends you that knowledge that okay, this was actually the most impactful thing. Be good, do good, find the people who are doing the kinds of things that you think should be done and try and contribute to it the best that you can.

I'm going to talk about laboratory automation and some biosecurity implications, sort of. I submitted the title for this talk prior to writing it, but I, I will be talking about lab automation, but mostly because I think that's a really important part of the story of how biology has changed. So we're doing biology in a whole lot of new places, and I think our norms and regulations around biosecurity have not really kept pace with that. When I think about how biology has changed, I usually like to think back about 40 years. That's when we had the first recombinant DNA and this is what things looked like&nbsp;then.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3ImbkrDoWIAqmIU4kAOMWW/01a05fdc436867d7ef2c5c54e07935f1/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3ImbkrDoWIAqmIU4kAOMWW/01a05fdc436867d7ef2c5c54e07935f1/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3ImbkrDoWIAqmIU4kAOMWW/01a05fdc436867d7ef2c5c54e07935f1/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3ImbkrDoWIAqmIU4kAOMWW/01a05fdc436867d7ef2c5c54e07935f1/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3ImbkrDoWIAqmIU4kAOMWW/01a05fdc436867d7ef2c5c54e07935f1/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3ImbkrDoWIAqmIU4kAOMWW/01a05fdc436867d7ef2c5c54e07935f1/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3ImbkrDoWIAqmIU4kAOMWW/01a05fdc436867d7ef2c5c54e07935f1/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>She's pipetting with her mouth back in 1975.

If you want to sequence a human genome today, it costs you about a thousand dollars and it will take you about a day. And we are well on our way to $100 genome and you see the same kind of trends in DNA synthesis costs. At this point, you know, this has all been enabled by new&nbsp;hardware.</p><p>At this point, if you are an individual, you can more or less have all of the tools you need to read, write and edit DNA in your home.

It's a DNA printer, but a lab for example, it could totally have this on their bench top. It costs about 50k. And then we're in the bay area. If you want to edit genomes, there is a local startup for that. This is the DIY CRISPR kit from The Odin and it will only set you back $159.99. And I really want to emphasize that a decade ago this didn't exist. There were no cheap tools for this even five years&nbsp;ago.</p><p>And so what all that means is that biology has become much cheaper and faster to engineer.

More than 40 countries have released a strategy for the national bio-economy. And a lot of these companies are so cool. They're doing really amazing science fiction things. I do want clean meat. I want new biofuels, I want spider silk ties, immortal dogs. I would like all of that, please.

I probably don't need to tell anyone in this room that technology moves faster than policy. And so I want to spend the rest of this talk talking about some ways that the policy has not necessarily kept pace. I'm going to start by talking about lab&nbsp;safety.</p><p>So Asilomar Conference, the place where they said please do not mouth pipette your bacteria: they put up this system of biosafety levels and if you've ever worked in a biology lab in Europe or North America, you have probably known that you were working at BSL one, or BSL two or BSL three if you're really fancy. So these specified containment and safety procedures, and the NIH in the US thought, this is great. We're gonna adopt this. We're going to make following these safety procedures a part of getting funding from us. This was a piece of regulation that worked great when we had academic biology. All of the biology that was being done was dependent on NIH funding, and so it was this effective enforcement of these biosafety regulations. Now when you have commercial labs and community labs, it doesn't work so well. Well, sort of. Most of the community labs I've been to, they still follow these biosafety levels because they were all trained in&nbsp;academia.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2paweJU0eUmaWwyG2GoWIW/c8112f015398c4881d1364380361d44e/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__10_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2paweJU0eUmaWwyG2GoWIW/c8112f015398c4881d1364380361d44e/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__10_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2paweJU0eUmaWwyG2GoWIW/c8112f015398c4881d1364380361d44e/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__10_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2paweJU0eUmaWwyG2GoWIW/c8112f015398c4881d1364380361d44e/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__10_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2paweJU0eUmaWwyG2GoWIW/c8112f015398c4881d1364380361d44e/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__10_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2paweJU0eUmaWwyG2GoWIW/c8112f015398c4881d1364380361d44e/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__10_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2paweJU0eUmaWwyG2GoWIW/c8112f015398c4881d1364380361d44e/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__10_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>There's kind of these strong norms about biosafety levels, but I want to emphasize that we're dependent here on norms and heuristics. Another place where there isn't really official regulation is in-gene synthesis. So nowadays you can order a semi-arbitrary sequence of genes and get those, get those synthesized for yourself. And back in 2009, there was a publication in Nature Biotechnology, going, maybe this is not great, maybe someone's going to order smallpox or something. We should probably put locks on the DNA printers and prevent them from printing dangerous sequences. The gene synthesis companies were not stoked about this. And so they requested\u2026 they put out this huge announcement. They said we're going to start screening everything against a database of known pathogens and this kind of screening protocol grew in popularity. They formed this international gene synthesis consortium, 80 percent of gene synthesis capacity uses their screening protocol and that's all&nbsp;cool.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1QMfSYiGos4Oq4UIaYMSWA/5c133af6a0c24f2002f82da896e04f6a/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__11_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1QMfSYiGos4Oq4UIaYMSWA/5c133af6a0c24f2002f82da896e04f6a/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__11_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1QMfSYiGos4Oq4UIaYMSWA/5c133af6a0c24f2002f82da896e04f6a/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__11_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1QMfSYiGos4Oq4UIaYMSWA/5c133af6a0c24f2002f82da896e04f6a/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__11_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1QMfSYiGos4Oq4UIaYMSWA/5c133af6a0c24f2002f82da896e04f6a/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__11_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1QMfSYiGos4Oq4UIaYMSWA/5c133af6a0c24f2002f82da896e04f6a/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__11_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1QMfSYiGos4Oq4UIaYMSWA/5c133af6a0c24f2002f82da896e04f6a/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__11_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>But you know, those synthesis companies have said we are open to being regulated nationally. We think this kind of screening should be required by national regulation and right now it is not. So this is not reassuring, but you might be thinking well at least these things are going to get regulated if they're ever getting, you know, getting released into the public coming to market, and that is sort of true. The US has this coordinated regulatory framework for the regulation of biotechnology, made it in 1986, and I sort of feel like if you have to put coordinated in the name, maybe it's hard to coordinate and depending on what kind of biology product you are making, you might be regulated by the NIH or the FDA or the EPA or the USDA or some unholy combination of all of those organizations. And even with all of those organizations, things can still fall through the&nbsp;cracks.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/48ucxEiOOIYAA2GSKSmws6/a14857b9e45ae7af9a99e08d92a7dfc8/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__12_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/48ucxEiOOIYAA2GSKSmws6/a14857b9e45ae7af9a99e08d92a7dfc8/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__12_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/48ucxEiOOIYAA2GSKSmws6/a14857b9e45ae7af9a99e08d92a7dfc8/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__12_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/48ucxEiOOIYAA2GSKSmws6/a14857b9e45ae7af9a99e08d92a7dfc8/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__12_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/48ucxEiOOIYAA2GSKSmws6/a14857b9e45ae7af9a99e08d92a7dfc8/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__12_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/48ucxEiOOIYAA2GSKSmws6/a14857b9e45ae7af9a99e08d92a7dfc8/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__12_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/48ucxEiOOIYAA2GSKSmws6/a14857b9e45ae7af9a99e08d92a7dfc8/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__12_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>So I think the glowing plant is an interesting example. They crowdfunded in 2013 on Kickstarter, so NIH funding is out, and they're also, I'm going to try to quote a National Academy of Sciences report here but I might get it wrong. They're not a plant or animal, they are not a novel plant pest or pesticide. They're not producing a novel chemical and they are not an inter-generic microorganism in commerce, which means in short that they were nobody's responsibility. So how do we stay responsible? How do we bring biosecurity to all of these new places where biology is happening? Well, this is the part where I say I'm doing a lightning talk, so I'm skipping over a lot and especially I'm skipping over a lot of the international context, but I do want to briefly touch on the bio weapons convention. The BWC. It's a big piece of international regulation. It forms an important part of that story. And what they've decided to do this year, they're having a meeting of experts about developments in science and technology and their plan is to develop a code of conduct for&nbsp;biologists.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7mWddsemjKgAAeuSqSCguG/42e54e8354ca1289a8ab3ffdb71f3bda/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__13_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7mWddsemjKgAAeuSqSCguG/42e54e8354ca1289a8ab3ffdb71f3bda/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__13_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7mWddsemjKgAAeuSqSCguG/42e54e8354ca1289a8ab3ffdb71f3bda/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__13_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7mWddsemjKgAAeuSqSCguG/42e54e8354ca1289a8ab3ffdb71f3bda/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__13_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7mWddsemjKgAAeuSqSCguG/42e54e8354ca1289a8ab3ffdb71f3bda/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__13_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7mWddsemjKgAAeuSqSCguG/42e54e8354ca1289a8ab3ffdb71f3bda/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__13_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7mWddsemjKgAAeuSqSCguG/42e54e8354ca1289a8ab3ffdb71f3bda/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__13_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>So again, that's kind of regulating through norms. Here in the US, the FBI has a bioterrorism countermeasures unit and in my experience, what they do is they go to community biolabs and introduce themselves, and I've had an FBI agent who's sort of come up to me and say, hey, you know, I'm your neighborhood FBI agent, if you see anything that makes you uncomfortable, here's my card, just give me a call. So it's kind of via relationships. And then, another kind of norm setting thing is this iGEM competition. They're an international competition that is basically trying to funnel all of the students in the world who are interested in synthetic biology through them, so that they can emphasize safety and security and hopefully set norms in this emerging field. So we have norms, maybe\u2026 maybe not the best way to do&nbsp;regulation.</p><p>I think norms are really important, but I don't think they're adequate on their own, especially because, you know, I've just scratched the surface. There's a lot more technology coming. One example I want to give, last year the Venter Lab published this digital to biological converter. And so this is something that takes the bio, the DNA synthesis, the printer that I showed you earlier, and it connects it to a bunch of other hardware and so it can print not only DNA but also RNA and various polymer is even viruses. And in a world in which you can email someone some instructions and they can use a machine like this to print out a virus, a lot of our containment regulations about: put locks on the door of your lab and make sure your freezers are, you know, well tracked so no one can sneak in and take a vial out of them, they're no longer really&nbsp;meaningful.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3EpWk3HSvmcsamaAe8goEg/308aaac653569167e1467caee7591183/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__14_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3EpWk3HSvmcsamaAe8goEg/308aaac653569167e1467caee7591183/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__14_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3EpWk3HSvmcsamaAe8goEg/308aaac653569167e1467caee7591183/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__14_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3EpWk3HSvmcsamaAe8goEg/308aaac653569167e1467caee7591183/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__14_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3EpWk3HSvmcsamaAe8goEg/308aaac653569167e1467caee7591183/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__14_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3EpWk3HSvmcsamaAe8goEg/308aaac653569167e1467caee7591183/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__14_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3EpWk3HSvmcsamaAe8goEg/308aaac653569167e1467caee7591183/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__14_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>And, that brings me to why I wanted to give this talk, which is that I think it is very difficult for people and especially regulators to keep pace with all of the biotechnology that is happening, and all the new places where we are doing biology. And I think it's really important to be aware, and at least maybe now you folks are more aware of some of these emerging technologies. In the reports I read over and over again, they say we need to do more horizon scanning or we need to develop better risk assessment protocols. And to me that sounds like the kind of research that effective altruists might be interested in, maybe even some of&nbsp;you.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/77Aadn2FryoCYUkueIaUQE/13e18c5291eac676e0321b9e1aaa966b/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__15_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/77Aadn2FryoCYUkueIaUQE/13e18c5291eac676e0321b9e1aaa966b/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__15_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/77Aadn2FryoCYUkueIaUQE/13e18c5291eac676e0321b9e1aaa966b/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__15_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/77Aadn2FryoCYUkueIaUQE/13e18c5291eac676e0321b9e1aaa966b/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__15_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/77Aadn2FryoCYUkueIaUQE/13e18c5291eac676e0321b9e1aaa966b/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__15_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/77Aadn2FryoCYUkueIaUQE/13e18c5291eac676e0321b9e1aaa966b/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__15_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/77Aadn2FryoCYUkueIaUQE/13e18c5291eac676e0321b9e1aaa966b/EAG_LaboratoryAutomation.pptx__15_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>And I just want to end by talking about something that kind of worries me, which is that over and over again, the story I hear from people is that they are waiting for something to go wrong for some do it yourself biologist to really hurt themselves, or for some DNA synthesis company to miss a dangerous order or some, some other thing that I won't even speculate about.

Recorded at Effective Altruism Global 2018: San Francisco, these are four lightning talks on Goodhart\u2019s Law, global food security, normative uncertainty, and forecasting future events. Transcripts of the lightning talks are below, which we have lightly edited for&nbsp;clarity.</i></p><h1>Scott Garrabrant: Variations of Goodhart's Law</h1><p>Goodhart's law is often abbreviated to say, \"When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\" So you can think about that as, you have some goal V, that is something that you want. And you have some measure of V which is U, which is something that you're actually able to&nbsp;measure.</p><p>And then you start optimizing U, and the process of optimizing U breaks the connection between U and V. This is relevant to EAs because we care about things and we measure things and we optimize things. And this is all about how that goes badly. I'm specifically talking not just about what happens when you have a bad measure, but the act of optimizing breaking the value of your&nbsp;measure.</p><p>And this is relevant to thinking about rationality, thinking as an individual human, and thinking about organizations, and also also for thinking about AI alignment. I want to show that there are four categories of different ways in which this can&nbsp;happen.</p><p>The first is regressional. This is one very benign. This is when you were optimizing for the proxy, and the proxy is not exactly the real goal. When you make the proxy large, you are making the real goal large, but you're also putting some optimization pressure towards the difference between your proxy and your real goal. Which means that your proxy will reliably be an overestimate of your real&nbsp;goal.</p><p>Next is causal. This is basically \"correlation is not causation.\" If you observe that your proxy is tied in with your goal, and then you start optimizing for the thing that is your proxy, that connection might no longer happen because what actually happened was maybe some third thing caused both of them. And then when you increase your proxy, your goal fails to also&nbsp;increase.</p><p>The next two are more interesting. Extremal is about how the worlds in which the proxy are very large might be meaningfully different from the worlds in which you observe the correlation between the proxy and the goal. This is much less benign than the regressional case. Like you could imagine that under small optimization power, there's a connection between your proxy and your goal. But maybe as your optimization gets very strong, you might be in a different domain. Where instead of naturally occurring correlations being the thing that affects stuff, you have resource limitations being the thing that affects stuff. And then all the observations that you made that originally connected your proxy and your goal kind of go&nbsp;away.</p><p>The last one is adversarial. So this is saying that the act of optimizing for your proxy, U, is providing an incentive for other agents to connect things that they want with the thing that you're optimizing, right? If I'm going to optimize for something and you want some other thing, you want to connect the thing that you want to the thing that I'm optimizing for. And if you think about, well maybe my goal requires some resources, and your true goal also requires some resources, but my proxy isn't really fighting for resources the same way that we are. If I'm using that proxy to optimize, then you're incentivized to make the world such that, when my proxy is large, actually your goals are satisfied instead, which destroys the connection with my&nbsp;goal.</p><p>As quick examples in basketball, regressional is just, if you take some really tall person, even though height is connected to basketball ability, they will not be the best at basketball, even compared to somebody who's maybe a little bit shorter but has more basketball ability. Causal is, if you want to get tall, it won't actually help to practice basketball. Extremal is like, the tallest person in the world actually has a disease which makes them unable to play basketball, because they're wearing leg braces. And adversarial is well, if you're measuring something about height, people are incentivized to do things like cheat your metric, because their goal is to get into your basketball team. That's it. Thank&nbsp;you.</p><h1>Finan Adamson: ALLFED</h1><p>I'm here to talk about ALLFED, the Alliance to Feed the Earth in Disasters. So far, that's mostly research from Dave Denkenberger and Joshua Pearce. We're focused on two kinds of scenarios, scenarios in which the sun is blocked, and scenarios in which industry fails, so in which the power grid fails for a long time. The sun could be blocked by things like nuclear winter, a supervolcano, or asteroid&nbsp;impact.</p><p>We could have industry failure from things like high altitude electromagnetic pulse from nuclear weapons, a solar flare, or a cyber attack. So our goal is to feed everyone in these disasters. We've done some research in the technical solutions here of how to feed everyone in industry disabled scenarios, which I'll go a bit into in this talk. Much of the past and current policy around preparing for this kind of disaster is just storing food. That has a couple of problems. One, we only have about six months of stored food globally, and many of these disasters could cause problems longer than that.

And we could clear some lands for more farmland. Some non-food needs are fairly simple in industry disabled scenarios. You can build pit latrines, you can boil water, you can make soap from animal fat. One of the non-food needs that is not simple is transporting food, which is something that would be necessary.

Feel free to go to our website if you want. You can check out our research&nbsp;there.</p><h1>Philip Trammell: Normative Uncertainty</h1><p>Right. We're all familiar about the idea of being uncertain about the true state of the world. That includes being uncertain about what the observable consequences of our actions will be. But we can also be unsure about what we ought to do, even given well-specified beliefs about the state of the world. Like we know it's going to happen and we have a precise probability distribution over what we think will happen. We can still be uncertain about what we should do. That's called normative&nbsp;uncertainty.</p><p>Two kinds of normative uncertainty that would be decision-affecting are moral uncertainty and decision theoretic uncertainty. So for instance, we might come across an opportunity to tell a lie and save a life, and even though we know exactly what the consequences would be, we just don't know what true morality is. It might be the right thing to do that or the wrong&nbsp;thing.</p><p>We might also be unsure about what the right way is to respond to uncertainty about the state of the world. So, whether we should maximize expected utility, as one decision theory would say, the most commonly accepted one. Or whether we should do something else, like be really risk averse and be min-max, or minimize the probability of the worst possible&nbsp;outcome.</p><p>It's relatively common in the EA community to think that we should take normative uncertainty seriously. We should think about our credences in the normative standards of behavior, and incorporate this uncertainty into our decision making. Will MacAskill and Toby Ord are EA philosophers who specialize in normative uncertainty. That means there's a lot of EA brain power going into this research&nbsp;question.</p><p>Some people have raised an objection to the whole concept of normative uncertainty, which is that it seems to lead into an infinite regress. The idea is, if we don't know what we ought to do in the face of uncertainty about what we ought to do, then it's like, what ought we to do if we don't know what we ought to about what we ought to do? And so maybe the whole concept of normative uncertainty is incoherent. But it feels like it's not. It feels like I can be unsure about what the right moral or decision theoretic framework is. So that's something I spent some time thinking&nbsp;about.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4I8szAz98IgKS2EiQcE6a8/7b4461d3b1cc685f1659594471ae0bb0/normative_regress.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4I8szAz98IgKS2EiQcE6a8/7b4461d3b1cc685f1659594471ae0bb0/normative_regress.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4I8szAz98IgKS2EiQcE6a8/7b4461d3b1cc685f1659594471ae0bb0/normative_regress.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4I8szAz98IgKS2EiQcE6a8/7b4461d3b1cc685f1659594471ae0bb0/normative_regress.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4I8szAz98IgKS2EiQcE6a8/7b4461d3b1cc685f1659594471ae0bb0/normative_regress.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4I8szAz98IgKS2EiQcE6a8/7b4461d3b1cc685f1659594471ae0bb0/normative_regress.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4I8szAz98IgKS2EiQcE6a8/7b4461d3b1cc685f1659594471ae0bb0/normative_regress.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Now the solution that I think makes the most sense is to say that you do have this infinite regress, but it reaches a fixed point for one reason or another. And so you have well defined subjective choice-worthiness, as they say, for all the acts that you could perform, whether you should tell the lie to save a life or whatever. This is a little stylized, but let's say you had the option to give $5,000 to the AMF to save a life for sure (assume you believe this will work), or the option to give the $5,000 to a biosecurity intervention, which will almost certainly save zero lives, but which has a one in a billion chance of saving one and a half billion&nbsp;lives.</p><p>So this is just a simple case of decision theoretic uncertainty. Let's also say you're certain that moral value is linear in lives saved, to make things simple. But you're just not sure whether to maximize the expected value or something else. So what expected utility theory would say is that what you ought to do is maximize the expected value. And so in this framework, what expected utility theory says is that the first order meta-choice-worthiness of the risky intervention is the same as its expected value, so in this case it's 1.5. And that's higher than the one that you can by giving to the AMF, so you should do&nbsp;it.</p><p>But let's say assign a 50% chance to expected utility theory being the normatively correct decision theory, and a 50% chance to some risk-weighted alternative, which says that the objective choice-worthiness of the act should be halfway between the minimum possible outcome that could result and the expected value. According to that alternative risk weighted theory, the subjective choice-worthiness ought to be 0.75, not 1.5. So you're not sure what it should be subjected&nbsp;to.</p><p>So what should you do in the face of this normative uncertainty? Let's say you have the same distribution over theories at every order of the hierarchy. You don't have to, but just to simplify, let's say that you do. Well, there's a 50% chance that what you ought to do in the face of this first order uncertainty is take the expected value. And there's 50% chance that you ought to do some risk-weighted thing, and so&nbsp;on.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5tbiKDa6LmuWE6wiWYwcoE/adf0b4ba81fe8892e62229221816cf59/normative_regress__1_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5tbiKDa6LmuWE6wiWYwcoE/adf0b4ba81fe8892e62229221816cf59/normative_regress__1_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5tbiKDa6LmuWE6wiWYwcoE/adf0b4ba81fe8892e62229221816cf59/normative_regress__1_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5tbiKDa6LmuWE6wiWYwcoE/adf0b4ba81fe8892e62229221816cf59/normative_regress__1_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5tbiKDa6LmuWE6wiWYwcoE/adf0b4ba81fe8892e62229221816cf59/normative_regress__1_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5tbiKDa6LmuWE6wiWYwcoE/adf0b4ba81fe8892e62229221816cf59/normative_regress__1_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5tbiKDa6LmuWE6wiWYwcoE/adf0b4ba81fe8892e62229221816cf59/normative_regress__1_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>And this can go on forever, and as long as certain mathematical properties are met about the hierarchy, then it will converge, and the subjective choice worthiness of the act will be well defined.

And so you would be indifferent between the risky intervention but with higher expected value and the $5,000 to the AMF. So this is all stylized and abstract, but the point is just that on its own the regress problem is not a knock down objection to the whole concept of normative&nbsp;uncertainty.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2dOx3fq5wcYuEqgQswquIq/a4024c8503f4f29129aaf63c446e4de2/normative_regress__2_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2dOx3fq5wcYuEqgQswquIq/a4024c8503f4f29129aaf63c446e4de2/normative_regress__2_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2dOx3fq5wcYuEqgQswquIq/a4024c8503f4f29129aaf63c446e4de2/normative_regress__2_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2dOx3fq5wcYuEqgQswquIq/a4024c8503f4f29129aaf63c446e4de2/normative_regress__2_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2dOx3fq5wcYuEqgQswquIq/a4024c8503f4f29129aaf63c446e4de2/normative_regress__2_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2dOx3fq5wcYuEqgQswquIq/a4024c8503f4f29129aaf63c446e4de2/normative_regress__2_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2dOx3fq5wcYuEqgQswquIq/a4024c8503f4f29129aaf63c446e4de2/normative_regress__2_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Your hierarchy of meta-normative uncertainty could, if it satisfies some conditions like always compromising between the points of the orders below it for instance, you'll always reach convergence. We can go a lot more into it, but I think that's basically the main takeaway. Maybe normative uncertainty makes sense after all. Maybe research into all of this, all of this theorizing about what one ought to do in the face of uncertainty or meta-normative uncertainty is actually valuable. And what the value is falls out of the model naturally, so you can work out like, \"Oh I should spend 30% of my time reading a decision theory book before I make this really momentous decision,\" or like 10%, or whatever. So that follows from the framework. And so maybe there's some value to&nbsp;it.</p><h1>Lawrence Chan: Criteria for Good Forecasts</h1><p>A lot of people in EA care about forecasting and having good and calibrated forecasts. And historically, a lot of people around the world, in universities, in the intelligence community have also cared about&nbsp;this.</p><p>But we spend a lot of time focusing mainly on how do we improve forecasts, given the current metrics for good forecasts that we have already? And most of the metrics that we have are based on calibration or correspondence-based scores. Basically like, here's what the true outcome was, here's what your probability that you assigned at a given time was, now let's see the sort of comparison. So like that classical Brier or log-based scores fall into this category. But in reality when we make forecasts over time, there are other desiderata that we might want to&nbsp;satisfy.</p><p>Like, we might need to satisfy other criteria, basically. And I think a classic illustrative example would be, suppose I'm trying to forecast what the weather would be like in two weeks. So on June 24th, what's the weather like in San Francisco? I might plot a chart of the probability I assign to it being sunny. Today I might say, it's pretty sunny outside, so I presume it's going to be sunny in two weeks, and I assign a very high probability, say&nbsp;90%.</p><p>And then tomorrow I don't feel very well, I might just give a 10% probability, and then the day after I might be very happy, I'll say 95%, and then the next day like 5%. People can basically see that, just looking at this sort of probability estimate, that there's probably something not correct about it. And in fact you can actually quantify how incorrect this is from a certain&nbsp;perspective.</p><p>So in economics, when people study financial markets, there's an idea of an efficient financial market. So one where you can't predict expected price changes. Or the expected price of any given commodity. This is the notion of efficiency in the economic sense. And this sort of belief is probably not efficient, right? Because you can just look at this and then say, \"Oh if my belief is over 90% tomorrow, like today, it's probably going to be under 20% tomorrow\" and vice&nbsp;versa.</p><p>And so using this as an inspiration you can actually develop a lot of tests by going to the economics literature and looking at what sort of properties do efficient beliefs or efficient markets need to satisfy. And I'll briefly go over three of them right&nbsp;now.</p><p>So there's the classic, you shouldn't expect to predict which direction your beliefs, or in which direction your prices will move. So basically you can just try to approximate this expectation, or you can try to approximate the difference conditioned on the current information available to you. And you can just check if it's zero. So you shouldn't expect any price changes or any belief changes. Basically if I know that my belief is going to be 10% tomorrow and I think I'm not going to be crazy tomorrow, and I'm still going to have good reason for believing that it's 10% tomorrow, I should just believe that it's 10% already&nbsp;today.</p><p>And likewise, there's also a sense in which my belief shouldn't move around too much. If we see that my beliefs go from 90% today to 10% tomorrow to 95% to 5%, there's a sense in which this is just moving around too much. And you can actually quantify this sense and then perform tests on this. And finally, what people actually do a lot in economics literature is they devise some trick in through which they can make some money in the market, and then attempt to check whether or not this trick actually&nbsp;works.</p><p>So you can do the same thing. You can try to think if there is a system of bets that you as a forecaster would take, that would lose you money, even though the system of bets only uses information available to you. And then so basically if you fail those tests, if you make bets that you know you're going to lose money in, that probably means that you're not doing a good job&nbsp;forecasting.</p><p>So for example, checking whether or not the expected price change is one way to make money, but you could also sell straddles, or you can do things like, I'll commit to buying at a certain point and then I'll commit to selling at a certain point. And often times formulating in terms of strategies to exploit the market is more natural for humans than going up there and then trying to do the math in your head, whether or not the expectation is equal to the current&nbsp;value.</p>", "user": {"username": "The Centre for Effective Altruism"}}, {"_id": "5L79YZnK2kcNiAQBn", "title": "Will MacAskill: Why should effective altruists embrace uncertainty?", "postedAt": "2018-06-08T19:26:00.000Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hXhPgpfgorU\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hXhPgpfgorU\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><hr><p><i>Probabilistic thinking is only a few centuries old, we have very little understanding on how most of our actions affect the long-term future, and prominent members of the effective altruism community have changed their minds on crucial considerations before.

You might not know that from his Open Philanthropy posts, but he's going to write about it in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>I talked about like having a different kind of gestalt, a different worldview. The aspect of that, that feeling of gestalt shift, was actually most present for me in some stuff Holden said. In particular, he emphasized the importance of self care, this idea that he worked out what's the average number of hours he works in a week, and that's his fixed point, he can't work harder than that, really. And that there's no reason to feel bad about it. And yeah, in my own case, I was like, \"Well obviously I kind of know that on an abstract level, or something.\" But hearing it from someone who I admire as much, and I know is as productive as Holden is, really helped turn that into something that I feel\u2026 now I think I am able to feel that on more of a gut&nbsp;level.</p><p>So, the theme of the conference was Stay Curious. And I talked earlier on about the contrast between Athens and Sparta. I think we definitely got a good demonstration that you are excellent Athenians, excellent philosophers. In particular, I told the story about philosophers at this old conference not being able to make it to the bar after the conference. Well, last night, attempting to go to the speakers' reception, two groups of us, one goes into an elevator before us, me and my group go in, go down, and the others just aren't there. Scott Garrabrant tells me they went from the fourth floor down to the first, doors opened, doors closed again, and they went right back up to the fourth. So, I don't want to say I told you so, but yeah, we're definitely doing well on the philosopher side of&nbsp;things.</p><p>So, we talked about being curious over the course of this conference. Now I'm going to talk a bit about taking that attitude and continuing it over to the following year. And I'm going to give quickly three arguments, or ways of thinking, just to emphasize how little we know, and how important it therefore is to keep such an open&nbsp;mind.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1vy8XM2WfiqKa6cqMOws6y/f1e92abb39b6e459f35e0805b21db33d/Slides_8.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1vy8XM2WfiqKa6cqMOws6y/f1e92abb39b6e459f35e0805b21db33d/Slides_8.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1vy8XM2WfiqKa6cqMOws6y/f1e92abb39b6e459f35e0805b21db33d/Slides_8.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1vy8XM2WfiqKa6cqMOws6y/f1e92abb39b6e459f35e0805b21db33d/Slides_8.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1vy8XM2WfiqKa6cqMOws6y/f1e92abb39b6e459f35e0805b21db33d/Slides_8.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1vy8XM2WfiqKa6cqMOws6y/f1e92abb39b6e459f35e0805b21db33d/Slides_8.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1vy8XM2WfiqKa6cqMOws6y/f1e92abb39b6e459f35e0805b21db33d/Slides_8.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>The first argument is just how recent many intellectual innovations were. The idea of probability theory is only a few centuries old. So for most of human civilization, we just didn't really have the concept of thinking probabilistically. So, if we'd made the argument like, \"Oh, we're really concerned about risk of human extinctions, not that we think it's definitely going to happen, but there's some chance it'd be really bad.\" People would have said just, \"I don't get&nbsp;it.\"</p><p>I can't even really imagine what it'd be like to just not have the concept of probability, but yet for thousands of years people were operating without that. Simple utilitarianism, again. I mean, this kind of goes back a little bit to the Mohists in early China, but at least in its modern form, it was only developed in the 18th century. And while effective altruism is definitely not utilitarianism, it's clearly part of a similar intellectual current. And the fact that this moral view that I think has one of the best shots of being the correct moral view was only developed a few centuries ago, well, who knows what the coming centuries&nbsp;have?</p><p>More recently as well, the idea of evidence-based medicine. The term evidence-based medicine only arose in the 90s. It actually only really started to be practiced in the late 1960s. There was almost no attempt to apply the experimental method more than 80 years ago. And again, this is just such an obvious part of our worldview. It's amazing that this didn't exist before that point. The whole field of population ethics, again, what we think of as among the most fundamental crucial considerations, only really came to be discussed with Parfit's Reasons and Persons, published in 1984. The use of randomized controlled trials in development economics, at least outside the area of health care, again, only in the 1990s, still very recent by societal&nbsp;terms.</p><p>And then the whole idea of AI safety, or the importance of ensuring that artificial intelligence doesn't have very bad consequences, again, really from the early 2000s. So this trend should really make us appreciate, there are so many developments that should cause radical worldview changes. I think it should definitely usher in the question of \"Well, what are the further developments over the coming decades that might really switch our views&nbsp;again?\"</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/wVTtPx52zQsKIUkKycc8m/f389d95889f44056a3b00c2a71cdae53/Slide_9.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/wVTtPx52zQsKIUkKycc8m/f389d95889f44056a3b00c2a71cdae53/Slide_9.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/wVTtPx52zQsKIUkKycc8m/f389d95889f44056a3b00c2a71cdae53/Slide_9.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/wVTtPx52zQsKIUkKycc8m/f389d95889f44056a3b00c2a71cdae53/Slide_9.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/wVTtPx52zQsKIUkKycc8m/f389d95889f44056a3b00c2a71cdae53/Slide_9.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/wVTtPx52zQsKIUkKycc8m/f389d95889f44056a3b00c2a71cdae53/Slide_9.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/wVTtPx52zQsKIUkKycc8m/f389d95889f44056a3b00c2a71cdae53/Slide_9.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>The second argument is, more narrowly, really big updates that people in the EA community have made in the past. So again, with my conversation with Holden, he talked about how for very many years he did not take seriously the loopy ideas of effective altruism. But, as he's written about publicly, he's really massively changed his view on things like considerations of the long-term future, and the moral status of nonhuman animals as well. And again, these are huge, worldview-changing&nbsp;things.</p><p>In my own case as well, certainly when I started out with effective altruism, I really thought, there's a body of people who form the scientific establishment, and they work on stuff, and then they produce answers, and that's knowledge. Then, I thought you could just act on that, and that was the way the scientific establishment worked. Turns out things are a little bit more complicated than that, a little bit more human, and that just, unfortunately, the state of empirical science is a lot less robust than I thought. And that came out in the early days of relying on, say the Disease Control Priorities Project, which had much shakier methodology, and in fact mistakes that I really, really wouldn't have predicted at the time. And that's definitely been a big shift in my own way of understanding the&nbsp;world.</p><p>And then, in two different ways, from my colleagues at FHI, their views on nanotechnology. Where it really used to be the case that nanotechnology was\u2026 atomically precise manufacturing was regarded as one of the existential risks. And I think people just converged on thinking that actually that argument was very much overblown. On the other side, Eric Drexler spent most of his life saying like, \"Actually, atomically precise manufacturing is the panacea. We can be at a post-scarcity world. We can have radical abundance. This is going to be amazing.\" And then was able to change his mind and actually think, \"Well actually, I'm not sure if it's\u2026 it might be good, it might be bad. I'm not sure,\" despite having kind of worked and promoted these ideas for decades. This is actually kind of amazing, that people in the community are able to have shifts like&nbsp;that.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5Rna9PxWPmQ6aim0wa2KQu/f780d1ada8df08340141e629d5c1dbeb/Slide_10.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5Rna9PxWPmQ6aim0wa2KQu/f780d1ada8df08340141e629d5c1dbeb/Slide_10.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5Rna9PxWPmQ6aim0wa2KQu/f780d1ada8df08340141e629d5c1dbeb/Slide_10.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5Rna9PxWPmQ6aim0wa2KQu/f780d1ada8df08340141e629d5c1dbeb/Slide_10.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5Rna9PxWPmQ6aim0wa2KQu/f780d1ada8df08340141e629d5c1dbeb/Slide_10.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5Rna9PxWPmQ6aim0wa2KQu/f780d1ada8df08340141e629d5c1dbeb/Slide_10.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5Rna9PxWPmQ6aim0wa2KQu/f780d1ada8df08340141e629d5c1dbeb/Slide_10.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Then the third argument I'll give you, is that if we've made these updates, perhaps we will make such significant updates again in the future. So the third class of arguments is just all the categories of things that we still really don't understand. So, I mean, the thing I'm focused on most at the moment is trying to build this field of global priorities research to try and address some of these questions, get more smart people working on them. But one is just how we should weigh probabilities against very large amounts of value. So, we clearly think that most of the time something like expected utility theory gets the right answers. But then people get to start a bit antsy about it when it comes to very, very low probabilities of sufficiently large amounts of&nbsp;value.</p><p>When we then start thinking about, well, what about infinite amounts of value? If we're happy to think about very, very large amounts of value, as long-termists often are thinking about, if we think it's not wacky to talk about that, why not about infinite amounts? But then, you're really starting to throw a spanner in the works of any sort of reasonable decision&nbsp;theory.</p><p>And it just is the case, we just have like no idea at the moment really, how to handle this problem. Similarly with something Open Phil has worked a lot on: which entities are morally relevant? We're very positive about expanding the moral circle, but how far should that go? Nonhuman animals, of course. But what about insects? What about plants or something? Seems like we have a strong intuition that plants don't have consciousness, and perhaps they don't count. We don't really have any good underlying understanding of why that is the case. There's plenty of people trying to work on this on the cutting edge, like Qualia Research Institute, among others, but it's exceptionally difficult. And if we don't know that, then there's a ton we don't know about doing&nbsp;good.</p><p>Another category that we're ignorant about is indirect effects and moral cluelessness. So we know that like most of the impact of our actions are in unpredictable effects over the very, very long term, because of butterfly effects and so on, because of the ways that our actions will change who is born in the future. We know that that's actually where most of the action is, and it's just that we can't predict it at all. So we know we're just peering very dimly into the fog of the future. And there's been basically almost no work on really trying to model that, really trying to think, well, you take this sort of action in this country, how does that differ from this other sort of action in this other country, in terms of its very long-run&nbsp;effects?</p><p>So it's not just that we've got this general abstract argument, looking inductively from experience in terms of how we've, as a society and as a community, changed our mind in the past. It's also that we just know that there's tons of things that we don't understand. So I think what's appropriate is a attitude of deep, kind of radical uncertainty when we're trying our best to do good. But what kind of concrete implications does this have? Well, I think there's kind of three main&nbsp;things.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5A7WPiB34AW0Gw8i0cgYS6/10e4666fe4c01f4503ea75550454649a/Slide_11.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5A7WPiB34AW0Gw8i0cgYS6/10e4666fe4c01f4503ea75550454649a/Slide_11.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5A7WPiB34AW0Gw8i0cgYS6/10e4666fe4c01f4503ea75550454649a/Slide_11.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5A7WPiB34AW0Gw8i0cgYS6/10e4666fe4c01f4503ea75550454649a/Slide_11.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5A7WPiB34AW0Gw8i0cgYS6/10e4666fe4c01f4503ea75550454649a/Slide_11.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5A7WPiB34AW0Gw8i0cgYS6/10e4666fe4c01f4503ea75550454649a/Slide_11.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5A7WPiB34AW0Gw8i0cgYS6/10e4666fe4c01f4503ea75550454649a/Slide_11.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>One is just actually trying to get more information, so continuing to do research, continuing to engage in intellectual inquiry. Second is to keep our options open as much as possible, ensuring that we're not closing doors, that even though they look not too promising, they might actually turn out to be much more promising than they were, when we gain more information going into the future, and when we change our minds. Thirdly is plausibly pursuing things that are convergently good. So things that look like, \"Yeah, this is a really robustly good thing to do from a wide variety of perspectives or worldviews.\" So, reducing the chance of a great power war for example. Even if my empirical beliefs about the future changed a lot, even if my moral beliefs changed a lot, I'd still feel very confident that reducing the chance of major war in our lifetime would be a very good thing to&nbsp;do.</p><p>So, the thing I want to emphasize to you most is keeping this attitude of kind of uncertainty and exploration through what you're doing over the coming year. I've emphasized Athens in response to this Athens versus Sparta dilemma, trying to bear in mind that we want to stay uncertain. We want to keep conformity at the meta-level and cooperate and sympathize with people who have very different object-level beliefs to us. And so, above all, we want to keep exploring and stay&nbsp;curious.</p>", "user": {"username": "The Centre for Effective Altruism"}}, {"_id": "DYZcqCpmMWJmPZbJQ", "title": "Lynette Bye: Planning productivity", "postedAt": "2018-06-08T07:15:00.000Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5rIGEJH5vM&amp;list=PLwp9xeoX5p8P3cDQwlyN7qsFhC9Ms4L5W&amp;index=31\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/N5rIGEJH5vM\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><hr><p><i>Improving the world can be challenging work, and there's a lot of it to get done.

I'm Lynette, and I'm a productivity coach with EAs. My focus is on helping improve the productivity of EAs and hopefully, through that, have more impact on the world. I got into this via studying psychology at Harvard and then doing research on self-control at the University of Pennsylvania and wanted to make that more applied and hopefully more of a direct&nbsp;impact.</p><p>Today, I'm going to be going over some of the techniques that have worked really well with my clients. Some of these may be new to you, and if you've read a lot of productivity stuff, some of this may be familiar, but I think it will still be valuable to go from hearing about it to diving in and practicing it today, which is the goal of this workshop. Think of the analogy of hearing about push-ups, thinking they're cool, versus doing push-ups. Today, we're going to do push-ups, except the easy kind where you type on your&nbsp;laptop.</p><p>To start off with, you'll have an opportunity for you to form accountability partners if you're interested in that, and then go into a bunch of practices on splitting tasks in a way that will reduce aversion and procrastination, and getting hands-on experience doing that. To get started off with this, can you boot up in your mind some projects that you'd like to do over the next couple of months? Take a second and think of a big project that's important to&nbsp;you.</p><p>With that, I want to start with an overview of why I think that these techniques work, and set up the framework for how to use these in your daily practice, with the ultimate goal of having this be a habit that you can do&nbsp;consistently.</p><p>One very common misconception I hear is something along the lines of, \"I wish I was a more productive type of person.\" It's this assumption that productivity isn't fully in our control. It'll often sound something like, \"I wish I was in the mood to be productive, and I'm just not.\" I think with this, an important step is to change that framework just a little bit. Many of you may already have this, where you're instead thinking about productivity as something that's a combination of strategies and skills and practice, and putting it with that framework. I'd like you all to try and adopt that mindset for this exercise today, if it doesn't happen to be the one you have&nbsp;already.</p><p>One really common thing is that you have a big goal. It's this big, one single task and someone would be constantly saying, \"Okay, I need to get started on this because this is important and I care about and I want to finish this goal.\" Then, they don't do it. Often, people will think that they're weak or lazy or just generally not productive. I think this is what feeds into that mindset, but I think that there's this other part here, this partially subconscious, partially conscious part that's something like, \"It's a big task. What if I can't do it? I don't really have a plan,\" and it's this big ugh field that forms an additional barrier making the goal harder to&nbsp;do.</p><p>From there, the really common response is just like, \"Ah, I don't know if I can do this. I don't want to think about it.\" Consciously or unconsciously, the decision gets made to just do it later. The present version of you kind of likes this. Your future you absolutely hates it. A little version of you that exists tomorrow still has to do it. They're stuck then, still faced with the same task. Essentially, this is like being the mean boss to your future self. It's saying, \"Okay, just do this,\" even though the current you doesn't want to do&nbsp;it.</p><p>What I'm trying to suggest is something like a partnership between these yous, where the you today is preparing this goal for the future you, so the future you will be kind back and do the task tomorrow, or later today. I actually think that this is a particularly useful separation because when you're trying to break down the task at the moment when you're doing it, it often has this additional ugh field, where if you can separate these two in time a little bit, it will sometimes relax that. And when this happens, all of the rest of you, these little strings of people going forward in time, are happy because they don't have to worry about that task anymore. It's changing this from mean boss to yourself, and hence unhappy employee to yourself, to a partnership to make your future self&nbsp;happy.</p><p>One suggestion of how to do that, is to take your big goal, this big boulder, and explode it, and instead of this one, monolithic, huge goal that's hard to do, you're left with smaller pieces, which feel a lot more manageable. Also, doing this can take an ugh field around a project, and make it a lot smaller, because instead of this whole big \"I'll fail this project,\" what you're doing is these little sub-components. The parts of your brain that don't like uncertainty and don't like fearing that they might fail think that there's a much better chance that they can succeed at this than at this whole thing right&nbsp;now.</p><p>Again, it's like this is the mean taskmaster you, where you're just dumping this goal on your future self. What I'm trying to do is have you break it down as the present you, for the future you, so you're handing the future you these nice little packages. I want to pause real quick, see if this makes sense to everyone or if there's any questions so far. Anyone would like to ask questions or clarify, just stick up your hands and the people with mics will bring you&nbsp;one.</p><p><i>Question</i>: In this model, you still have the initial task of breaking it down. If you're in a mindset where you feel like, I just don't want to do this, doesn't that extend also to the task of breaking it down? To frame it another way, what's to stop my current self from just pushing off the task of breaking it down to the future&nbsp;self?</p><p>We'll get to two parts of that. The part so far is that you're not trying to do this all at once. So I'm suggesting you break this up a little bit, if you suspect that that would happen, so you're just doing the part of breaking it down right now. For that part, it's a first step. It will often feel less aversive, instead of trying to both break a task down and also do it all at once. It's also something that can be better planned and fit into your schedule in the routine times, like here's your time to go about doing this, and I think once you make a habit of it, this step stops feeling as aversive and starts feeling more&nbsp;natural.</p><p>Before the first step, it's like breaking this task down already to make planning its own step. I'll work with a lot of clients who say, \"Hey, this seems familiar. I've heard this before.\" And then they come back the next week, and they're like, \"Wow, it actually worked.\" What I'm trying to do is to start today that process, that cycle of putting it into practice and seeing that it works, so that your brain doesn't find it aversive and hopefully gets to a point where it finds it exciting. That would be&nbsp;ideal.</p><p>For the other part, when I think of an ideal planning structure, I think of something like this where you have top level goals and then consistent parts where you look at the level above it, make plans, and trickle those down, so that what you do each day is directly linked back to your top level goals. In this case, those will be those projects you booted up in your mind today, those things that you care about completing in the near&nbsp;future.</p><p>Today though, we're just going to focus on this step. This is just a little taste of what I would normally do with a client, but since we have an hour and not several weeks, it works best to do a little chunk. This one is really well suited as an initial planning phase to get that ball rolling, to get started on making this a habit with granular enough detail that you can still break down tasks into little bite-sized chunks, but also a high enough perspective that you're making sure these are tied back to your goals. With that, before we start the experiment time, I want to check for more&nbsp;questions.</p><p><i>Question</i>: How accurate do you expect your first breakdown of the task to&nbsp;be?</p><p>I think it depends. I see a variety of outcomes with people when I'm working with them one-on-one, so I expect that that will be true in this audience as well, but I think that the experience of starting to do it and then refining on that a bit is like a good way to get the ball rolling, to dive in and see what it feels like, and then from there, you can apply that to life outside and keep iterating on it, but starting with this is like\u2026 I think it's actually a pretty good way of starting to get that&nbsp;taste.</p><p>To set up the frame for this, we're about to dive into the part where you guys start doing your experiments, so if you have laptops, pull them out now. If not, I suggest finding something to write with, either a phone or a notepad if you have them&nbsp;available.</p><p>Part of what we're going to be doing is setting up a weekly planning habit, something for you to try out, to see this process iterated over time. I'd like everyone, if they would want to, to be able to have a chance to get an accountability partner here, someone that you can do this with for at least a couple weeks and see how it&nbsp;goes.</p><p>Write a little bit about the goals that you booted up earlier, to have those in your minds as you're breaking down what are things you might want to work on over the next month. Just have a couple sentences in here, and I'll give you just a minute or two for this&nbsp;one.</p><p>Okay. One quick thing in here, why I'm having you do this all in writing instead of in your heads is that humans are very optimistic about how much stuff they can store in their brains and how much their working memory can process at a time. To me, it looks something like this where your present self is saying, \"I will remember it,\" and your future self says, \"Remember what?\" This is what we're trying to avoid right now, so by having it done in writing, you can refer back to this later. Basically, as a weekly habit, I'd really say just that you should do it in writing, because doing it in your head typically means you'll forget several of the things, for good or&nbsp;bad.</p><p>Now, everyone, just take a couple minutes to plan out, what is the big goal that you'd like to complete over the next week? One big project, one task that'll take a couple hours but is particularly aversive to you. Something that is very important to you that you'd like to do, and you also anticipate that you will be tempted to procrastinate or just not get started on for a while. As a next step, write out all of the sub-steps that can go into your task to break it&nbsp;down.</p><p>I generally recommend that these sub-tasks take no longer than an hour, but I basically determined this by, what is a small enough task that it doesn't feel bad to start right now, if you were going to do that? Try and break it down to that level if you can. Now is also the time where you can think about ordering and prioritizing these. So, are these in a process that you could fit well in this workflow? And, are you choosing a reasonable amount to try and complete over this next week? Something very common is we severely overestimate how much we can do. It's commonly called the planning&nbsp;fallacy.</p><p>It looks something like this, where we estimate that we can do a bunch of little blocks. At the end of the time, we come up with only a few blocks, and then feel sad. So I'm saying, start out with something more attainable to begin with. Ironically, this actually helps you get more done, frequently, because you have this manageable amount and as you're getting on in the day, maybe you're feeling a little bit tired, but here's what you have left, where if you have all of your to-do list of everything you ever want to get done left, that's going to feel way more overwhelming and not finishable right&nbsp;then.</p><p>Let's continue on to the next page. See how you would like to make this a habit. I highly recommend that you try to do this every week for at least a couple weeks to experiment with it. This is just a tiny taste of what I would do normally, but it's a really solid foundation of something to try on your own and experiment with and keep going, and it doesn't take a lot of time, so you can fit it into your week pretty easily. I have the steps in here for how to go about setting this up as a habit that you'll probably&nbsp;continue.</p><p>So the first is a trigger. What is going to be your cue for when in your schedule, when in your week to fit this in? Really common times with my clients are something like Monday or Friday where you're either looking back at your week and reviewing it and setting up for the next, or as you get started out in your week on Monday, setting it up and looking&nbsp;back.</p><p>Things that I've come across before are, do it right before you go to bed on a particular day of the week, or do it first thing in the morning on a particular day of the week. I have someone who runs home from work, so when he puts on his running shoes, he triggers to review his plan. It's like, what can you use as a cue for, \"Okay, here's when I do it?\" Probably tied to a day of the week&nbsp;though.</p><p>Also, I think it can be fine to do it on the weekend. Frequently, people don't want to be focusing on their work time then, so they'd prefer to have it built into their work schedule, but I personally do it on Saturdays, and I think that that works just&nbsp;fine.</p><p>Okay. If you have a trigger, the next step is how you will do this. Imagine very vividly, how you would go through this process. It could be something like what you're doing today, on a piece of paper or even on this form if you want us to keep using it. It could also be something in an app. A couple of useful ones that I have here are Complice, Workflowy, and Wunderlist. I think that both Workflowy and Wunderlist work pretty well for putting in the steps that you want to complete over the next week, so you just have this list that you can check each day. Complice works well for daily planning if you want to add that in at some point. I recommend starting with just the weekly if you haven't done that already, as a keystone to build up and make it easy to get started,&nbsp;though.</p><p>Once you have a plan for how you're going to go about doing this and complete the plan, then I suggest, what reminder can you set? What outside trigger outside of your own brain will remind you to come back to this? Something like an alarm or a sticky note or an accountability partner work really well for&nbsp;this.</p><p><i>Question</i>: An issue that comes up for me personally is after I set my plan, I struggle with the fact that I have to say no to other plans seeping in or other introductions that may veer me off the plan, so, yeah, what's the strategy for&nbsp;that?</p><p>The general recommendation for that that I have is to set things aside if they're not urgent, and work them into your next week plan. If they're urgent or clearly higher priority than what you're working on right now, just revise your plan for the week. Depending on your job, most jobs don't have this come up too often, that you would need to redo your whole schedule. This also relates to the planning fallacy; build in extra time that you don't think you need so you can have the cushion of things taking longer than you think they will, or new things popping up, because that almost always happens. If you have a bit of a cushion, usually that can just absorb whatever little things pop up and you won't need to redo your whole&nbsp;schedule.</p><p>I want to do a five-second version of a longer CFAR technique called Murphyjitsu. This is a way of checking whether you expect your plan to succeed and if not, how can you fix it? The five-second version of this is going from the mindset where your brain is like, \"Hmm, I made a plan. This seems like it could work. Smiley face. World's good. My plan worked,\" and instead asking if that plan fails, would you be surprised? This is checking against all the other simulated futures that your brain is producing all of the time. Often, what it turns up is several worlds where it doesn't expect you to succeed. It expects you to fail, because it knows that there's loopholes here that will likely cause your plan to&nbsp;crash.</p><p>I want everyone here to just ask yourself, \"If my plan failed, if I did not review this in a week, did not come back and do the weekly planning, would I be surprised?\" If you're not feeling something close to shock of like, \"Oh my word, how would that happen?\" then ask yourself why it would fail. What are the loopholes? Are you just going to forget that you planned to do this? Are you going to be too busy and not have time? Think about how you would get around&nbsp;those.</p><p>This is just one exercise, but I wanted to get everyone diving in and practicing it. If there's other things that you wanted to discuss, I want to make myself available for&nbsp;questions.</p><p><i>Question</i>: In part of being overambitious with your plans, I think it can be really easy to have like many focuses on what you want to accomplish. Can you describe how you would really just narrow your focus to just say, \"I want to accomplish this one thing alone and kind of block out everything else to achieve that&nbsp;goal?\"</p><p>I have a couple different approaches to this, that depend on the person. The most common one would go something like, narrow down your focuses to the top priorities based on the near-term future that you're working towards, and what would be most important long-term? Is there anything that would be really life-changing, like learning how to code or something for people who want to do that? Then, narrow down what is the most important step over, say, a month. Set one ambitious goal for that, and then set everything else aside. For people who are really struggling with this, we can sometimes even do it on a week scale like, \"Here's what you're going to focus on for this week,\" and really try and set the other focuses aside, try this out, and you can iterate very quickly that way if this is the wrong focus, but that also gives you the ability to do this thing, dive in, and complete something when frequently, the problem is there's lots of these things in progress, and none of them are getting completed or really doing focused work on because there's too much switching going on. You just prioritize like super near-term, basically, and just make sure you accomplish the particular, small task you're focused&nbsp;on.</p><p>For people who are particularly struggling with this, I find that prioritizing near-term gets them used to the idea of picking one thing and doing it, and then they can treat that more flexibly as it works for&nbsp;them.</p><p><i>Question</i>: I was wondering if you had recommendations for how specific versus general a project goal should be and how short-term versus long-term, if that has any bearing on what you find people are successful with? Should we make a lot of short-term goals or maybe fewer long-term&nbsp;goals?</p><p>I think that it helps to have a broader sense of what your long-term goals are, and I find that that can be very motivating for people, but it's almost impossible to have really specific long-term goals because things change so much. You learn a lot as you iterate. You want to have that flexibility, so I generally make general long-term goals, or specific long-term goals with the stated intention that this is flexible and will likely change, and then very specific near-term goals. And the near-term goals, you have a much higher level of commitment to. It's like, \"Here's actually what I'm going to do. Over the next week, I'm really committing to accomplishing this goal.\" If that turns out to not be the best way to tackle this, I can iterate after that, but I'm not dithering while I'm trying to do the work. Because that mindset of like, \"I want to do this, but I am not positive,\" can often lead to a lot of ambivalence. Committing for a short-term very strongly to a very concrete goal can help a lot with&nbsp;that.</p><p><i>Question</i>: In my job, I'm a product manager, so there's a lot of different stuff I have to do, with multiple levels including strategic, and then just solving bug or something like that. How do you help people prioritize something that they really need to get done in an environment like&nbsp;that?</p><p>Yeah. This would be very customized to the particular constraints of your situation, but an idealized case would be something like, you carve out some blocks of time for your really important focused work that you need to get done. Often, this will include things like turning off email. When I'm doing this, I turn all my devices to airplane mode, and I'm just unreachable for like two hours. And then, also times where you batch smaller tasks, like responding to your co-worker's emails or something like that, and you do that all in one batch, which reduces the task on your brain of switching between things, and lets you just more efficiently get through it, and then separating some of&nbsp;these.</p><p>A lot of roles like that, where you have to be very responsive, don't have quite that freedom, so sometimes, you can do things like carve a work block on a weekend or at a time when other people aren't working as much, in order to build that flexibility in. It really depends on your personal situation how exactly we structure that, but I usually try and have people to have some focused time, and then some time where they batch admin if there's a lot of that that they have to do. And a lot of that is experimentation of how much time do you need for admin, what times of the day are you most focused, et cetera, and I'll work plans through a setup of testing out what works for them, and then maintaining a habit of implementing&nbsp;that.</p><p><i>Question</i>: Yeah. I was just going to ask, how can we most effectively act as accountability partners? I guess things like, are there particular structures for like how these interactions are supposed to take place and also things like, what are we supposed to hold each other accountable on? Is it things like making sure that you do the planning, or is it like whether you're actually accomplishing the goals that you set&nbsp;out?</p><p>Excellent question. I think one really good structure is that you hold each other accountable for meeting every week, and then during that time, you either do the planning together, or have already done it and discuss it in the meeting. You can decide on this. I don't think it really matters that much. And then, you hold each other committed to the task that you want to be, so you mark the things that you're really committing to, to each other, and then you follow through on those together. I think that there's a lot of variation on how this can be. You could have some sort of financial or social penalty if they fail, or it could just be your partner looks at you reproachfully, which can be highly motivating to people. It&nbsp;works.</p><p><i>Question</i>: Say I just finished a very intensive work session for like 15 minutes, and I have 10 minutes before the next 15-minute intensive work session. What would you suggest us to do for that 10-minute relaxed time to relax more efficiently, so we can better prepare ourselves for the next intensive work&nbsp;session?</p><p>I think that that's something that works really well with experimentation. Often though, it works well if somebody changes up what they're doing. So like, if they've been sitting, working at a computer, they should get up, move, stretch. Something that will engage a different part of your brain or body than the one that you've just been working on can help spread out the load,&nbsp;basically.</p><p><i>Question</i>: I guess related to the question about how to be a good accountability partner and maybe slightly an awkward question to ask: like, what if your accountability partner isn't very good? How much should you prepare for&nbsp;that?</p><p>In my experience, bad accountability partner usually means you don't hear from the person again, in which case, I would suggest finding a new&nbsp;one.</p><p><i>Question</i>: How would one go about finding a new accountability&nbsp;partner?</p><p>One option would be to email me. I can't guarantee this would work, but I do frequently have people requesting accountability partners, and I'm happy to keep names in mind. If you do so, I ask that you include your time zone because I found that coordinating someone in India and California is kind of hard to do sometimes. Another option there, if you use Complice, is that there's a thread that you can link to from that that will take you through who's looking for an accountability partner. Sometimes, you can find one on there if you're using that particular app. It works really well. You can also just ask your friends. Sometimes, that actually works really&nbsp;well.</p><p><i>Question</i>: Related to the question about relaxation, what happens if you have like stochastic periods where you're not sure when you're blocked in something? For example, if I'm programming, my code might take surprisingly long to compile, or I might be sending something off a code review and I don't know when they'll get back to me. What should I be working on in the&nbsp;meantime?</p><p>I very rarely see situations where people are just like, \"I don't have anything to do right now.\" Usually, there's something you can do, often on more light admin side, getting stuff out of the way if your main project is on hold. It's also really useful to send an email reminder to yourself for when you expect to hear back from these people, so if you are waiting on people, you know when it's the appropriate time to nudge them and that automatically comes into your awareness, instead of waiting for them for like two months and then like, \"Hey, how's it&nbsp;going?\"</p><p><i>Question</i>: If it's a period of waiting that's anywhere from 5 minutes to 30 minutes, should I be starting another project? Should I be doing the emails? What should I be doing then, when it's not certain how much time I'll&nbsp;have?</p><p>I think it really depends. If this is something where you just have a little break, you could do emails. You could use that as your break time instead of the 15-minute timer. I don't think there's one uniform answer for such a broad range of possible&nbsp;things.</p><p><i>Question</i>: What if something comes up this week but you already have the next week planned&nbsp;out?</p><p>I generally treat plans as somewhat flexible. When I'm doing the weekly, I have the month planned out, but I have each week that I just plan at the beginning of it, so I can adapt it to what's happened before. For projects where you need to have a bigger timeline to make sure you're meeting some deadline at the end, you might want to see how can you catch up and schedule that with yourself or someone else in order to do that, or you may want to adjust what you have planned for the next week to put off some lower priority things that maybe you can set aside, in order to finish the urgent task that you still have left over. If it's something that wasn't that high priority, you didn't do it, it doesn't seem necessarily important, you can often just not do it. It's one way to filter out what are lower importance things that you shouldn't actually be trying to&nbsp;do.</p>", "user": {"username": "The Centre for Effective Altruism"}}, {"_id": "sKRZs564yAMvsoWJ3", "title": "A.J.

In this talk from Effective Altruism Global 2018: San Francisco, he shares some of his favorite techniques for enhancing productivity.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>A transcript of AJ's talk is below, including comments from the audience, which we have lightly edited for&nbsp;clarity.

I only have half an hour, so I'm going to try to be as efficient as possible. I'll give you some quick background on myself: I'm a writer and a journalist, and what I like to do is do experiments on myself, change my lifestyle and see what makes it better, and what makes it more miserable, which is often the case, and then figure out what I can take&nbsp;away.</p><p>Perhaps my best-selling book was called The Year of Living Biblically. That one is where I knew nothing about religion, but I decided to learn about it by following all the rules of the Old Testament, so the Ten Commandments. I grew a beard, I stoned adulterers - I used pebbles so that I didn't get arrested - and, by the way, I gave one tenth of my income to widows and orphans as instructed. So, that was a very early version of Giving What We Can, I think. They needed better metrics, but the idea was pretty&nbsp;good.</p><p>I got involved in EA a couple of years ago, because I wrote an article for Esquire Magazine, and the premise was if I were to donate my writing fee of a couple thousand dollars so that it could do the maximum good in the world, where would I donate those $2,000? Naturally, delightfully, I ran across EA and Will MacAskill, and Peter Singer, and I've been a huge fan ever since. Amy Labenz asked me to speak today because some of my books and experiments have to do with productivity and efficiency, and motivation, so I'm delighted to share the strategies I've learned over the&nbsp;years.</p><p>Experimentation is my unifying theme. That's my big theme, so I encourage you to try these out. Not all of these experiments are going to work for everybody, and some of them you may already be using, but my hope is that we experiment and find some of them helpful. And I'm going to cover, quickly, four themes today. Motivation, how to get yourself to do something you don't really want to do. Outsourcing and crowdsourcing, unitasking, like how to avoid multitasking, and speed, not the&nbsp;drug.</p><p>One final note is, one of the strategies I find most helpful in all projects is crowdsourcing. For a couple of years, I wrote an advice column where people would send in a question like, \u201cI'm staying at someone's house and I think they hate me. What should I do?\" Then, I would put it out to all of my Facebook friends and followers, and get hundreds of answers, and then take the best of those answers. So, I find crowdsourcing a super effective method. So today, after each one of these four, I'd love to hear from one or two of you of a strategy that you find helpful, especially with apps. I know some apps for productivity, but I'm not an ultimate expert. This is not my full-time job, motivation and&nbsp;productivity.</p><h2>Motivation</h2><p>All right, starting off with motivation. How do you convince yourself to do something? My friend Tim Urban calls it the procrastination monkey. How do you get rid of that procrastination monkey in your brain? And a lot of strategies I picked up when I was doing a book called Drop Dead Healthy, and this was where I tried to be the healthiest person alive. So eat healthy, exercise, sleep healthy, go to the bathroom healthy. I can tell you about that later. We don't have&nbsp;time.</p><p>All right, so let me give you a couple of strategies that helped me with that, because I definitely did not want to act in a healthy way, but I forced myself to. First was the idea of egonomics, which is from a Yale professor. The idea that we do have our current self and our future self, and they have different ideas of what we should be doing. The current self wants to sit on the couch and the future self wants to be alive. And there are studies that show the more you think about your future self, the more you will act in a good way, a healthy way, a productive way, a moral&nbsp;way.</p><p>So my advice is to treat your older self like you would treat a friend. Be altruists to your older self. And the studies say that the more concrete your older self is, the more likely you are to treat it well. So this, you don't have to do this. But I took a photo of myself, like a selfie and I digitally aged it, and I printed it out, and I put it over my desk. So every time I was procrastinating or not wanting to go on the treadmill, I'd look at my future self and he'd be like, \u201cCome on, do it, do it for me. You want to be around.\u201d Similarly, there's black mailing yourself. This one I found very&nbsp;effective.</p><p>During this year, I would eat a lot of these dried mangoes, that's my vice. Which may sound semi healthy, but it's really just candy disguised as fruit. Just a lot of sugar. So I made\u2026 again, the same professor at Yale came up with this idea to blackmail yourself. I had my wife write a check for $100 and I said if I eat another mango, then you have to send this check, and the check was to the American Nazi Party and it was so crazy effective. And there are websites that will do this. There's one called stikk.com, S-T-I-K-K.com. So you make a contract with&nbsp;yourself.</p><p>And I was told that the Effective Altruism version of this is called bee-something. Beeminder? Okay. So, I didn't even know that, but I'm delighted. Another effective strategy I found, I think might resonate with this crowd, is appealing to the utilitarian inside of yourself, because there are studies that when you have a clear vision that you're doing good for the world, you are more motivated to&nbsp;act.</p><p>So there was a study by Adam Grant for fundraisers, they were doing college fundraising. And when he showed them video testimonials from kids who had benefited from the scholarships, they raised three times as much money. So the more concrete and visual you can be about realizing that you're doing good. And I actually, I used this today, 'cause I was like, \u201cI'm not getting paid, no offense, but like should I just phone this in?\u201d and I'm like, \u201cYou know what, if I can increase these people's productivity by like 1.5% each, and you guys are all doing amazing work, like I am having a huge&nbsp;impact.\u201d</p><p>So that motivated me to actually prepare, whether it seems like it or not. I do this as well when I exercise. I also am not self-motivated to exercise, because I'm married. And unfortunately, I'm not proud of it, but I don't care what I look like, but I do want to see my kids grow up. So I'm motivated to exercise, I focus on&nbsp;them.</p><p>Miniature goals, this I found incredibly effective, and Lynette yesterday talked about exploding big goals into little ones, and that's just, I do that all the time and I tell my kids to do that. But I even break it down into the micro goals because, I actually do like to answer emails while walking on the treadmill, but sometimes I just don't feel like it. So I will break it into a micro goal. I'll say, I'll trick myself, I'll be like, \u201cAll right, just put on your sneakers. You don't have to do anything else. I'm not saying you have to go on the treadmill, your only goal is to put on your sneakers.\u201d And I put on the sneakers and then I am propelled to the next goal. So micro goals I find very&nbsp;useful.</p><p>Delusional optimism, that I find an extremely useful tool because as we know, most ventures worth anything, they have a small chance of succeeding, but you've got to convince yourself that they have a bigger chance, or you will never do it, at least for me. So when I was writing this health book, I remember I woke up filled with despair many days that it's too big a topic, like how am I\u2026 I'm not a doctor, how am I going to write a book about all of health? And what I would do is I would act as if I were optimistic and eventually, I became optimistic. It's basic cognitive behavioral&nbsp;therapy.</p><p>So I would call up my publisher and I would say, \u201cAll right, so when this book comes out, let's have a big party and serve Kale Martinis,\u201d and once you do that for a couple of hours, you become optimistic. All right. If I could pause really quickly for a crowdsourcing moment, is there anyone who has one quick tip on how they motivate themselves that might\u2026&nbsp;yeah.</p><p><i>Audience</i>: Epic music.</p><p>Epic music. Like what is&nbsp;that?</p><p><i>Audience</i>: Like you're on an&nbsp;adventure.</p><p>I love that. I'm gonna try that. Yeah. Either&nbsp;one.</p><p><i>Audience</i>: Five minute timer. Spending just five&nbsp;minutes.</p><p>Interesting. All right. Because I was going to talk about the Pomodoro technique, which some of you might know, where it's you do 25 minutes and then 5 minutes off, but I like that, that's even less time. All right. I definitely want to hear more and hopefully we'll have a little time. I'm talking quickly, but I just wanna to get quickly to the other&nbsp;sections.</p><h2>Outsourcing and Crowdsourcing</h2><p>The next is outsourcing and crowdsourcing. This, about 15 years ago now, outsourcing was just starting and I read about it, how these banks or law firms would hire people in India to do their repetitive tasks, like data entry. And I'm just a writer, I didn't have a corporation, but I was like, \u201cThat's an interesting&nbsp;idea.\u201d</p><p>So I decided what if I outsourced myself, outsourced my life? So, that's what I did. I hired a team of people in Bangalore, India to do everything for me. So they answered my phone, they answered my emails, they argued with my wife for me, it was fantastic. And this came out as an article in Esquire and it was reprinted in Tim Ferriss's book, The Four Hour Workweek. I don't know if you've read that. And just very quickly, he called me. He had never written a book, and he called me out of the blue. He's like, \u201cI'm a first time writer, I don't know what I'm doing. Can you help me be a writer?\u201d And I was like\u2026 I gave him whatever wisdom I had, which wasn't&nbsp;much.</p><p>And then he said, \u201cI loved your article. Can I reprint it in my book?\u201d And I'm like, \u201cThis guy is a first time writer, who I've never heard of. He doesn't know what he's doing.\u201d \u201cSure. Reprint it. I'm not gonna charge you, being a jerk.\u201d And then like a year later he calls me, he's like, \u201cYeah, my book is number one on Amazon.\u201d I'm like, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d But I'm actually happy because he's got a huge cult following. And so it did work for me in the end. And as an effective altruist, hopefully it worked for other&nbsp;people.</p><p>But anyway, just a couple of thoughts on outsourcing, because now it's become much more commonplace. There are several places that do it. The one I used and the one that Tim mentions is called getfriday.com. And there's another one called getleverage.com that a friend of mine started. I have not used it, but he's very smart, so I'm thinking it'll be good. Of course, there's places like TaskRabbit and Fiverr, and just a couple of notes on when you outsource, one thing I've found is the importance of being very precise in what you ask for. Especially if there's a language barrier, things can get messed&nbsp;up.</p><p>I remember I asked for a wax paper to keep my vegetables and we ended up getting a wax mustache strip remover for women. And my wife was like, \u201cWhat are you saying?\u201d And it was ugly. So, and this may sound strange, but I honestly think one of my favorite\u2026 one of the most effective things I did while outsourcing is I outsourced my worry. I was really stressed out about a family matter, but I knew that worry\u2026 problem solving is good, but worrying is a waste of time and energy. So I said to Asha, in Bangalore, I asked her, \u201cWould you please for 10 minutes every day, I will pay you, to worry for&nbsp;me.\u201d</p><p>I don't know if it works for everyone, but it was an amazing feeling to know that every time I started to worry, I'd be like, \u201cthat's taken care of.\u201d And you don't have to hire someone. I've found what you can do is you can switch worries with a friend and say, \u201cI'll worry for you, and you worry for me,\u201d because you don't have the emotional connection to their worry, so it's not all that unpleasant to worry for&nbsp;them.</p><p>Now, moving onto crowdsourcing for a second. Again, I love that, the advice people gave was amazing. I also am a big fan\u2026 like, I have a book coming out in November and I was talking to you about that, and I didn't know what the title was. The publisher had a title that I didn't love. So I think I did it on Mechanical Turk on Amazon, where you can do very inexpensive polls or Google ads to figure out what works better, what will get more clicks. And so actually it worked, because I got my title, because I showed them the data. I'm like, \u201cLook, this gets a lot more clicks.\u201d It's called Thanks a Thousand. They wanted to call it Thank You&nbsp;All.</p><p>But what I did was instead of a poll, I said, \u201cBuy this book,\u201d which doesn't exist yet. I didn't say that but, \u201cClick on this to buy this book.\u201d And then when they clicked on it, there was like, \u201cYou can sign up and get it as soon as it comes out.\u201d But that way I think it's more accurate than\u2026 because people don't really necessarily know what they're going to buy, but if they click on that link, then they have intention. So, that's a little tip. And by the way, some of you may know Spencer Greenberg, who is an effective altruist, he's coming here today. That guy is the master of Mechanical Turk and crowdsourcing. So I highly recommend you go to his talk and talk to him about&nbsp;that.</p><p>Let's see. Oh, and finally, I don't know what to call this, source sourcing or something sourcing. I have a friend named Charles Duhigg who writes for the New York Times, and he wrote a book on productivity, so he knows what he's doing. And I asked him his interview style, and he said what he does is he doesn't, like most journalists, come up with a list of questions. He goes to the person, he gets them on the phone and said, \u201cYou know your topic better than I do. Can you tell me the five things that I should do? What are the most common questions? What are the biggest concerns?\u201d So he totally outsourced his job to the people he's talking to, and I thought it was brilliant, and I've tried to do that a&nbsp;little.</p><p>Okay. Oh, so let me pause for a quick crowdsourcing. I don't know if anyone does outsourcing or crowdsourcing, but if they do and they have a tip or a service they like, I would love to hear it. Anyone.&nbsp;Yes.</p><p><i>Audience</i>: For interviews I use something called Rev.com. Do you ever use transcription? I record them on my phone and then I just email them off to somebody in Rev.com, and 24 hours later, the entire transcription comes. So I never have to&nbsp;transcribe.</p><p>I have many friends who use that, I've never used it, but I should. And it's a human. It's not a software&nbsp;program.</p><p><i>Audience</i>: It's a&nbsp;human.</p><p>Because there are software programs, but I'm not sure they're quite up to&nbsp;standard.</p><p><i>Audience</i>: About a dollar a minute, but it's pretty worth it, because think about your&nbsp;time.</p><p>That's great.</p><p><i>Audience</i>: R-E-V.com.</p><h2>Focus and Unitasking</h2><p>All right. I love that. Anyone else with an outsourcing or crowdsourcing tip? Okay, next we've got focus and unitasking. This was an article, a chapter of a book I wrote called The Unitasker, where I tried to just spend a month just doing one thing at a time, which is not easy. And, as you probably know, multitasking is not only inefficient, it also doesn't really exist, because you can't do two cognitive tasks at the same time and you're losing energy when you switch from one task to another. You're losing mental energy. You're losing&nbsp;time.</p><p>So, how to be a unitasker. One of the most effective strategies which you might've heard of, is called the Odysseus strategy or the Ulysses pact, and it comes from the Odyssey where Odysseus was going on a ship and he was about to go to the sirens, and he knew that if he heard their voices, he would leap into the water. So he had his sailors tie him to the mast and put wax in his ears. So this has become a very successful strategy in work. And I took it far more literally than maybe it was supposed to. I actually did tie myself to my desk chair and it worked. It worked. I was like, \u201cAll right, I can't get up,\u201d but you don't have to do&nbsp;that.</p><p>There are many apps that use the Ulysses pact idea, like Freedom, where you're cut off from the Internet and you have to reboot your computer, and it's so shameful when you do that, but hopefully you don't do that. There's the Pomodoro technique that I was mentioning earlier and there are several apps on your phone or computer where it will cut you off for 25 minutes, and it'll tell you, \u201cAll right, 25 minutes is up. You're allowed to have that five minute break.\u201d I actually found this effective, weirdly: when talking on the phone, I shut my eyes and actually talk on the phone. And it's a revelation. It's like, \u201cOh, I'm actually having a conversation. I'm learning things instead of just doing my email.\u201d So it really changes the tone of the&nbsp;conversation.</p><p>I think that social media, of course, and the Internet, no shock there, they have huge downsides, and I really do think reading the news several times a day increases our negativity bias, because you're seeing all the horrible things, and it is just a motivational drain. So I really do try only to read the news once a day at night because what I find is I get really depressed and then I can fall asleep. I also wrote an article on creativity hacks, like what are the best creativity hacks, and I'm happy to talk about those. But one of them had to do with this, which was some creativity is when you're taking a shower. But some of it, I find it very helpful to actually block out 15 minutes a day for&nbsp;brainstorming.</p><p>And it could be general brainstorming about anything. It could be specific about a project or a book. But I find if I don't do that, the day just slips away. You've got to really be proactive with your calendar, show your calendar who's boss and actually put in, all right from 2:00 to 2:15, I'm going to brainstorm ideas. And sometimes, even though 98% of those ideas are going to be useless, it really does help keep my brain\u2026 I do believe in the analogy, the brain is like a muscle and the more you use it, the stronger it&nbsp;is.</p><p>So sometimes if I don't have anything, I'll take anything. I'll take a snowman and be like, all right, \u201cWhat can I do with a snowman?\u201d And I'll just play with it. What about a snow transgender person? Snow nonbinary person? What if instead of a pipe, they're vaping? And I honestly find that, when I am in a situation where I need to think quickly, I feel that I'm more prepared. All right. So, oh, I think there must be some good tips from you guys on focusing. So I'd love to take.&nbsp;Yeah.</p><p><i>Audience</i>: I built my own hackintosh that has no Wi-Fi, no Bluetooth, no audio driver and no video driver. I do my writing on&nbsp;that-</p><p>Thank you for reminding me, but I have two computers, one that I write on and one that is connected to the Internet, because I do think that if you're trying to write on the one that's connected to the Internet, it's just nearly impossible. All right. And then finally, and then we can talk your hacks. What is my final one? Speed. This is a short one, appropriately. But I did write an article once on how to do things faster without sacrificing&nbsp;quality.</p><h2>Speed</h2><p>One hack that I use that I love, and that I'm trying to spread, is I have adopted Skype lunches. So instead of going out to lunch with someone where you lose like 15 minutes, half an hour getting there, you have to wait for the waiter to bring the check. I say to a friend, I'll be like, \u201cYou order lunch, I'll order lunch and we'll do it over Skype.\u201d And it is awesome. I highly recommend it. It is so efficient and you do get the face-to-face. You maybe lose a little because you're not in person, but you do get the face and you do get privacy. I have a friend who's very tech savvy and he chooses a background, so we could eat in Paris at a cafe. So Skype lunches, I'm a big fan&nbsp;of.</p><p>You guys might already know this, but double speed is a beautiful thing for podcasts, and for videos on YouTube, and for anything. There's a great app that is free. It's a chrome extension called Video Speed Controller. Does anyone use it? Three? Four? Yeah. All right, let's see. Oh man, it is a thing of beauty. Because you can watch anything. You can watch Netflix, you can watch Hulu, you can watch anything as fast or slow as you&nbsp;want.</p><p>And I have friends who are in the movie industry and they're not so happy about that. But some movies, like I watched Manchester by the Sea, I watched that on double speed and it was still slow. It was like, \u201cJesus.\u201d So, yes, I am a big fan of that. And if you do go out to lunch, this is a little hack I learned from my former editor at Esquire. If you're going to have a lunch that you are required to go to but are not excited about, and if it's a nice enough place, you go to the host and say like, \u201cCan you bring me the check in 40 minutes?\u201d And so you set it up. Yeah. It's not the nicest thing, but listen, you're doing it for the greater good. You need to get back there and do your real&nbsp;job.</p><p>All right. I'd love to hear any hacks that you guys have for speed, there must be some ideas that you have, any apps or&nbsp;anything.</p><p><i>Audience</i>: The common one that every place I ever walk to, I'm talking on the phone with someone, usually my family, but every single long&nbsp;walk.</p><p>Well, you know what I like. I love that. But I also like to come up\u2026 I find that I don't trust my brain, because it will wander into dark corners that are not productive to me or anyone else. So I will choose a topic to think about, a problem that I have that I'm going to think about on my walk to work. And then when I get there, I'll have four or five solutions, and maybe one of them will work. So I am a big fan of scheduling my thoughts and I find that very helpful along those&nbsp;lines.</p><p>Well, look at that. See, 10:30. Damn, that's good. It would be very embarrassing if I did a productivity efficiency thing and I only got through half and rambled. So 10:30, I got through my little points, but I'm around in office hours if you guys are interested in talking more about this topic. Again, it's more of a conversation, I'd love to learn from you too. So, thank you very much. It was&nbsp;fun.</p>", "user": {"username": "The Centre for Effective Altruism"}}, {"_id": "XbvZ3ypdYyEN8NRS7", "title": "Duncan Sabien: Manage your personal autopilot", "postedAt": "2018-06-08T07:15:00.000Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=284_dY3_u6w&amp;list=PLwp9xeoX5p8P3cDQwlyN7qsFhC9Ms4L5W&amp;index=29\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/284_dY3_u6w\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><hr><p><i>\u201cDo you know what you\u2019re doing, and why you\u2019re doing it?\u201d According to Duncan Sabien of the Center for Applied Rationality, this is a key question to ask yourself throughout life.

I'm the curriculum director and COO at The Center for Applied Rationality in Berkeley. We put on four and a half day rationality workshops, and also some targeted programs for groups like AI researchers, mathematicians, so on and so forth. Our goal is to improve human rationality. In this talk, I'm going to try to give you a little taste of what we do at workshops, and what we've been figuring out, and what we're all&nbsp;about.</p><p>I'm sad to say that it's not going to work. There's an effect that we've noticed where when we give an hour long talk, people leave super excited about rationality, and about the potential to be better at achieving their goals and figuring things out. And what happens is, it's sort of like if you had just found out about the concept of pushups. You're like, \"Man, pushups, that sounds so cool. I can be so strong, and my arms would look so&nbsp;good.\"</p><p>But there's a very big difference between learning about pushups and actually doing pushups. So to frame this talk, most of this talk will be me telling you guys about pushups, and how cool pushups are. But on base rates, very few of us will leave this talk and then go do pushups. So make it be you. You're going to be the one that breaks the frame, and goes out and actually does stuff. Make&nbsp;sense?</p><p>Cool. Occasionally there might be spots for people to ask questions and make comments. If so, we'll have a mic that we'll send around, because they're recording, and it makes it a lot easier for the recording to be sensible. Please talk into the mic. But otherwise, we're just going to dive right&nbsp;in.</p><p>My first question is, do you know what you are doing and why you are doing it? I'm actually going to repeat this question a whole bunch over the course of the hour. So get prepared to get bored by it. But right now you're in this room. I'd like you to take 20 seconds and check, do you actually know why you're in this room? What brought you here? Is there a reason? Are you just on autopilot? Take 20 seconds to&nbsp;check.</p><p>Every time I say take 20 seconds to check, you're also certainly welcome to just sit there not doing anything. I won't know. But from nope to yep, raise your hands to the extent that you know what you're doing and why you're doing it. So here is, \"I have no clue.\" Here is, \"I'm like a perfectly rational automaton.\" Nope to yep, can I get all the&nbsp;hands?</p><p>Neat. Not bad for EAG. Okay, so human rationality. My framing on human rationality is that it has two major parts. We're trying to get better at forming true beliefs, and letting go of false ones. And we're trying to get better at taking effective action. In other words, you want to actually be able to say the sentence, \"It's going to work,\" and have that sentence be true. Right? And when you can't honestly say that sentence you should caveat, the way that I just caveated a second ago. So hopefully this is what you're interested in, because this is what we're going to dive&nbsp;into.</p><p>So, CFAR is an organization made up of specific people who have done specific research. CFAR has a canon. It's sort of an attempt to make rationality be a thing, and our canon is this large battery of techniques. I've drawn up a whole bunch of them. You can come take pictures of this at the end if you're interested. We have techniques with neat names like Double Crux, and Focusing, and Goal Factoring, and Systematization, and Resolve Cycles, and Murphy-Jitsu. And each one of these techniques is an attempt to solve a certain problem. I will say the problems a little bit slower so you guys can catch&nbsp;them.</p><p>We have a technique that we've invented to try to help navigate intellectual disagreement. We asked ourselves the question, why is it that some conversations, some fights go a hundred times better than other conversations and other fights. And we tried to techniqueify the difference. We have a technique that we stole, called Focusing, which is for drawing info out of your subconscious or implicit models. The idea is, how can we take advantage of all of the stuff that our subconscious model, like our system one that's listening all time, how can we take advantage of this information, that doesn't land in our verbal loop? How can we draw it out and get a handle on&nbsp;it?</p><p>How is it that sometimes you end up doing something that doesn't achieve your goals very well at all? The classic example is, raise your hand if you or someone you knew was going to law school or medical school because they wanted to make their parents happy? Is that the most cost efficient way to make your parents happy? So we have a technique that's designed to deal with mismatches between goals and plans. We have a technique for modeling just what's going on in your second-to-second cognition, what's actually going on in your&nbsp;brain.</p><p>We have a technique for bulletproofing plans. Somehow we have this capacity to make plans that just don't work. And have you ever confidently declared that you'll be at the airport by 7:00? Right? We have a technique for overcoming decision paralysis. We have a technique for automating away drains on your time and attention, for resolving internal&nbsp;conflicts.</p><p>The thing about all these techniques is they're all sort of fake, right? The art of human rationality is not evenly dividable into single kicks and punches. We make up these little kicks and punches so that people can practice the basics and ingrain them. But most of our staff members, most of our alumni rarely sit down to use goal factoring. We will, once in a while; the techniques are pretty cool. They do actually&nbsp;work.</p><p>But what's much more important is this holistic lump. This big, vague, misshapen, ill-defined lump of human rationality. The idea of being able to see what's real, and do what you're trying to do. So don't think of this as a checklist. Where like, \"Once I've collected all the techniques, then I will be a superhuman rationality machine.\" In point of fact, people with that mentality tend to plateau very early on. What you want to do is keep&nbsp;looking.</p><p>All right. I will actually teach you some of the techniques, though. We're going to talk about TAPs today. And if you attended Eli's Double-Crux session yesterday, that was great. If you didn't, get a time machine. And later on today there's a Murphy-Jitsu session that will be pretty fun as well. But okay, this is not a workshop, and we only have an hour. So rather than trying to feed you all of that rationality in bite-sized chunks that won't work, what I want you to learn how to do is invent your own rationality\u2026 and that's what we'll spend the next little bit talking&nbsp;about.</p><p>By the way, do you know what you're doing and why you're doing it? Reactions of any kind are appreciated. Yes, okay. I'll explain later on why I'm going to keep repeating that point over and over again. But actually check, do you know what you're doing and why you're doing it? Okay, I'm going to give you three\u2026 those of you who can squint, you can see \"Ah, there's&nbsp;three.\"</p><p>I'm going to give you three different lenses on how to invent your own rationality. This is basically how CFAR gets its material, where we learn things from. Sometimes there's something cool that comes up in the cog-science literature that we can just take. They're like, \"Here's this new thing that we've discovered.\" And like, \"Great, we can just teach that at the workshops.\" But very often cognitive science research doesn't really address the things that we care about, and so we have to cobble together our own&nbsp;rationality.</p><p>This is my favorite version. This is a timeline. You're on it right now. You're over here. Let's see if I have a blue in my pocket. Yes, this is you. And what's happening is you're on this timeline that's pointed toward the universe where you end up happy, and successful, and the good thing happens. But for some reason, over and over you end up down&nbsp;here.</p><p>This is like you discover that you have eaten an entire package of Oreos. Or you discover that you are once again having the same fight with your boss, or with your significant other. You discover that you are once again getting angry in traffic and your blood pressure is up. All of this sort of thing. This model make sense? There's a&nbsp;timeline.</p><p>All right, there are three places to look if you are trying to invent rationality, I claim. And those three places are, here, here, and here. Take a moment to stare at that. And if you are actively participating, form some opinions about why I circled those three spots. Nope to yep, do you have opinions? Neat, I hope they agree with mine, because that would be data that I may be&nbsp;right.</p><p>Okay, the idea here is humans are a process, a very complicated, messy lump of hundreds and hundreds of algorithms, all fighting at the same time. And somehow this process is ending up down here. I like to look in these three places. Because here, nothing has gone wrong yet. Here, we're just living our life. If you're the sort of person who has road rage, you haven't even gotten on the highway yet. If you're the sort of person who eats compulsively, you haven't even gone to the cabinet yet,&nbsp;right?</p><p>Your significant other walked in the door, and all you've said is, \"Hi, how are you?\" You haven't started talking about politics yet, right? So this is an interesting place to look, because there's something about the way that we move automatically through the world, kind of on autopilot. We'll talk more about our autopilot later in the&nbsp;hour.</p><p>But you're just like\u2026 and your autopilot is what takes you down here. If you've ever made a New Year's resolution and then by March you haven't made any progress on that New Year's resolution, because you literally just never thought of it again. That's your autopilot in action, right? The New Year's resolution would require you to do something different from what you normally do, and you just didn't. With me so&nbsp;far?</p><p>Cool. This point is also a fascinating point to look at. This is more obvious. This is where most people look. When did things go wrong? Right? Why did it all go wrong? Identifying this point is not always easy. If you're the sort of person who eats an entire package of Oreos, was this point the moment that you ate the fifth Oreo? Or was it the moment that you took Oreos down out of the cabinet? Or was it the moment that you purchased the&nbsp;Oreos?</p><p>It's not always easy to tell what the actual point divergence is. But if you can zero in on this point, and you can find the actual split where you went left and you should have gone right, according to your own values, you can build a lot of rationality out of that. Especially out of looking at it like, why did you go the wrong way in the first&nbsp;place?</p><p>There's a principle that we teach at CFAR. We loosely title it The Good Faith Principle. The idea is that everything that goes on in your brain, everything that you do should be taken in good faith. The idea is that every impulse that you have, every thought that floats across your consciousness is trying to be good, and trying to make the world good, and trying to make your life&nbsp;good.</p><p>The problem is sometimes it's just like, \"Oops, mistaken.\" Like we really crave sugar, at least in part, because in the ancestral environment sugar was mostly found in things like fruit, which had a ton of calories, and had a ton of micro nutrients available. And so our bodies learned to like sugar, because that was a marker for other good things. And then we learned how to separate the sugar from the fruit, and like, \"Oops,\"&nbsp;right?</p><p>But the part of you that craves sugar and is driving you towards sugar, and wants you to eat every single Oreo, it's trying to make your life good. It's trying to get you nutrients, and calories, and that sort of thing. It just happens to be miscalibrated for the world that you find yourself in. And so, rather than kicking the part of you that likes Oreos, it's better to like, \"Good job, sugar craving. I see how you're on my side. You're trying, but we're going to go over this way where the broccoli is.\" So looking here and figuring out not just what went wrong, but why it went wrong is a fantastic place to unpack&nbsp;rationality.</p><p>Many of our techniques come from looking at that moment when things either go well or badly. And we look at people who do things\u2026 people who are dramatically effective. And we're like, \"What was going on in their brain, second-by-second?\" And we look at people who are dramatically ineffective, and like, \"What was going on in their brain, second-by-second?\" And we try to cross-compare and figure it out. Any questions so far? Yes, do we have the microphone?&nbsp;Yes.</p><p><i>Audience</i>: Yes, so you didn't put a circle on the happy path, on the right there. Why&nbsp;not?</p><p>Yes, if you're already on the happy path, it's less urgent that you ask questions and figure out what's going on. It's still great to know what's going on even when things are going well. But it's more critical, I claim, to figure out what's going on when things are going&nbsp;badly.</p><p>The third circle, the reason for this third circle is, I like to look here more than most of my colleagues do. A lot of my colleagues are like, \"We should focus our interventions here.\" But this is a place where I often have the benefit of noticing. I'll be sort of asleep, and then like, \"Ye wake up, and ye find ye self having eaten two rows of Oreos, and there's one row&nbsp;left.\"</p><p>And it's like, \"Well, I mean I've already fallen off my diet. I'm a terrible person, so I might as well.\" That's the failure with abandon kind of thing. I like to look in this place because my brain is often awake and aware at that point. Like if you are a road-rage type person, this is where\u2026 down here is where you and the other person have pulled off to the side of the road and are getting your respective baseball bats out of the trunk,&nbsp;right?</p><p>But here, this is the point where you've swerved in front of them and turned on your windshield wiper fluids so it's going to mess up their\u2026 it's bad. It's bad, but it's not hopeless. And it's a lot easier to correct back from here, than it is to get all the way back up from here. Make sense? So for me this is another primary place to look for interventions, and inventions, and figuring out, \"Okay, how can I re-correct course from that&nbsp;spot?\"</p><p>So, what we're going to do now, we're going to put 90 seconds on the clock. If you're exhausted, or you haven't woken up yet, feel free to just zone out. But if you're playing along at home, then you're going to take 90 seconds, and you're going to look for some dynamic in your life that matches this model that I've drawn here. Some place where you keep ending up in the frowny-face&nbsp;land.</p><p>And you're going to just take a quick, just quickly, quickly, see if you can find anything in any of these three spots. Make sense? Cool, 90 seconds, go. And If you can hear me, start humming\u2026 everybody humming. Social peer pressure to be quiet again\u2026 nice. That's how we do it CFAR workshops, so I don't have to shout all the&nbsp;time.</p><p>Cool, quick aside. You guys know the trope, where there's shoulder advisors. There's the angel on one side, and the demon on the other. This one was like, \"Eat all the Oreos.\" And this one was like, \"Eat your broccoli,\" yes? What I would like you to do, humor me for a moment, is pop back into this dynamic. Visualize it, if you have visual imagery. If you're the sort of person who doesn't have visual imagery, just do whatever it is that you do when you're reading a&nbsp;book.</p><p>But go back into that moment for me, and I want you to imagine a tiny little Duncan popping up on your shoulder. And what he says is, \"Do you know what you're doing, and why you are doing it?\" Do me a favor, actually visualize that. Cool, thanks. All right, our second method of inventing rationality. This is a method we call bow tie or hourglassing. We haven't actually turned it into a class yet, so we're not sure what the name's going to be. Naming things is very&nbsp;important.</p><p>But here we have a blue person, that's you, who's looking at an orange person who is awesome. The orange person is awesome at some skill. Maybe they're a really good writer. Maybe they're a really good athlete. And you, the blue person, want some of it. You want to invent some rationality and steal what they've&nbsp;got.</p><p>This method, by the way, comes in part from Ben Franklin, you can look up more about how Ben Franklin learned how to write. Basically, the idea was he would take articles that he admired from the papers, and he would stare at them really hard. And he would develop theories about the principles that the author of the article was adhering to. So you take a large corpus of data, and you try to boil it down to a small set of&nbsp;principles.</p><p>Does that make sense? So his theory might be something like, \"This person never uses words that are more than three syllables.\" Or, \"This person tries to get alliteration into every paragraph,\" or something like that. He would squint at it and try to distill out what he thought was most important. Then using those principles, he would generate his own copy of the article, usually several weeks later. He would let the article drain out of his head. He would have taken notes on the specific, boring content of the article, like who said what, and what happened. Because that wasn't the part he cared about. He cared about the style of&nbsp;writing.</p><p>So he took notes on the boring stuff. He would come back to his outline, \"Okay, here's the article that I have to write. I have to write that so and so said such and such.\" And then keeping these principles in mind, he would try to generate his own copy of the article. And then he would take that copy, and he would compare it back to the original. He would put the two of them side-by-side, and he would look at what he had written and what the person he admired had written, and he would find the places where he wasn't living up to the standard that he wanted to meet. And he would also find the places where he had done actually better, where he was a little bit smug about his own turn of phrase being even cooler than the other&nbsp;person's.</p><p>And then lather, rinse, repeat. He would take the data, distill the principle, attempt to act in accordance with the principle, double check. Maybe he refines his understanding of what the principles are, like, \"Actually it wasn't this thing, it was more that thing,\" and looping through and through. Does this make sense as a concept? Yes? Okay. So you can't actually do this right now, probably, because you don't have all of this stuff. What I would like you to do, we're going to take another 45 seconds in silence. I would like you to think of somebody, or some skill, some place that you want to steal from, where you could actually employ this&nbsp;process.</p><p>So some blog author that you really would like to copy, or some athlete who had videos on YouTube that you could watch. I used to steal parkour technique in a fashion similar to this. You're looking for a place where someone has something that you think you could steal, model, mimic, and compare. To become a better person, according to you. Better at this skill that you want. Anybody uncertain about what I'm asking you to do? You're brainstorming a plan for the future, opening up an affordance for&nbsp;yourself.</p><p><i>Audience</i>: Is it always with the same piece of material, or different&nbsp;material?</p><p>Both. Yes. Sometimes you'll repeat with the same exact piece, and sometimes you'll repeat with a different piece by the same author. And sometimes you'll repeat with a different author. The overarching thing is do what makes sense. You never want to go through motions just because you're supposed to go through the motions. Remember, do you know what you are doing, and why you are doing&nbsp;it?</p><p>If it's just because Steve said so, Steve better be real darn good, and you better be real sure that you understood exactly what Steve wanted. It's very easy to get lost in the weeds. Cool, 45 seconds, brainstorming. What do you want? What can you steal?&nbsp;Go.</p><p>Cool, raise your hand to the extent that you've found something. Neat. Raise your hand if you already\u2026 immediately, you're like, \"I know. I know what I want.\" Once again, in pairs or triplets, just swap for a couple of&nbsp;minutes\u2026</p><p>You guys can be louder than that. Come on, hum\u2026 there we go, humoring the sixth grade teacher in me, thank you. Quick double check. Do you know what you are doing, and why you are doing it? I want you to take 30 more seconds with your partner or triplet. And like, \"Why is this thing worth learning?\" What's the glorious, golden, juicy thing that is behind your desire to have this skill, or have this&nbsp;experience?</p><p>It doesn't have to be profound. There's no\u2026 I'm not being smug about, \"Well, this one's altruistic, and that one's just self-congratulatory.\" But what's the\u2026 does it make your life more beautiful? Does it make you a more effective person? What is the reason that you want this thing? 30 more seconds&nbsp;each.</p><p>Neat, if I can get the mic ready\u2026 I just want a handful of people to share the thing that you want, and why it's good. Just raise your hand if you're willing to share in front of everybody.&nbsp;Yes.</p><p><i>Audience</i>: My role model was Bill Clinton, and I would love to have his mastery of relationships. The ability to connect deeply and immediately with people in a variety of&nbsp;circumstances.</p><p>Okay, cool. Wait, you forgot to say&nbsp;why.</p><p><i>Audience</i>: There's really two parts. One is that relationships are the secret to happiness, and great relationships can give you a very satisfying life. But also, being able to connect with people is a means to an end. Whatever you want to do, it's unlikely that you can do it alone. And so, if you're doing it with other people then you need to be great at&nbsp;relationships.</p><p>Anyone else?</p><p><i>Audience</i>: I would like to be able to write and produce content effortlessly. And my two heroes, or people that I want to steal from in this regard were Tyler Cowen, and Scott Alexander who seem to be able to just magically write and produce extremely insightful and conversational blog posts in their&nbsp;sleep.</p><p>And what's good about the universe where you have this&nbsp;power?</p><p><i>Audience</i>: It opens up a lot of professional and influence opportunities to build your personal reputation and brand in a way that scales. And also to communicate whatever message you want to communicate, to as broad of an audience as&nbsp;possible.</p><p>Nice. By the way, just in reference to Scott Alexander in particular. As my colleague was developing this techniquelet, the thing that he did it on to test the model was, How to Title Blog Posts as Well as Scott Alexander Does. He practiced creating\u2026 He came up with all these principles of how Scott Alexander makes his titles. Maybe one more?&nbsp;Yes?</p><p><i>Audience</i>: Yeah. Mine was being able to develop questions that are very insightful, and my role model for that was Sam Harris, who in his podcast is able to generate really insightful questions that aren't answered by the authors, who have written books or newspapers. No, I'm sorry, newsletters are something else. Yes, his able to come up with these really good questions. And the reason why I'm interested is because it's important to be able to have good conversations with experts, and even in job interviews being able to ask questions that haven't been answered&nbsp;anywhere.</p><p>Cool, very good. A regular thumbs up. One thing I'll point out is that nobody, none of the three people that I chose had as part of their motivation wanting to feel good about themselves, or being able to be smug, or proud, or something like that. Which, it's possible that that motivation wasn't in the mix. But surely, for at least one person in the whole room, that motivation is in the&nbsp;mix.</p><p>And I don't want you to be unwilling to look at it. Good faith principle. I think your desire to be smug, and your desire to be awesome, and your desire to feel good about yourself are also things that should get a thumbs up. You don't necessarily let them steer. You don't necessarily give them the steering wheel. Then if you're optimizing for smugness, you'll probably do bad things. But if you have in you a desire for smugness, you can channel that and use it for good the same way that you can channel your desire for sugar into eating more&nbsp;fruit.</p><p>Cool. All right, moving ahead. Third step, how to invent your own rationality. So we have looking at yourself. We have looking at other people. And now we have, looking at the world. Squinting at the whole world, seeing, building models of how it works, figuring out your own understanding of what's going on in a&nbsp;situation.</p><p>And in particular, finding the places where it seems obviously broken and bad, and why is everybody doing it so wrong. It's almost incomprehensible. How could they be doing it so wrong? Nod if this resonates for you at all. Yes, this is where we've invented something like a third of our rationality techniques, is just one staff member who doesn't do it wrong, because of luck, because of experience, whatever. They're just like .. they're finally just like, \"I can't stand it anymore. I'm going to make a technique, and I'm stop all of you from\u2026\" And it's&nbsp;great.</p><p>For instance, I'm not going to say this out loud because I don't know what the standards are about swearing. But probably my next essay is going to be titled something like this, because I just can't take it anymore. So, again, we're going to take just 30 to 60 seconds. Where is the world just obviously broken in&nbsp;particular?</p><p>Sometimes you already have this. You know exactly what's going on, and you could model it, and you could explain it to an eight-year-old, and the eight-year-old would learn from your wisdom and never get it wrong themselves. Sometimes it feels like this is impossible, like you'll never be able to crystallize out a model. It's just too large, too complex, you can't really get your fingers on all the&nbsp;gears.</p><p>I'm looking for the places in the middle. Places where you haven't really figured out what's going on, but maybe if you sat down for a Saturday afternoon you could. Does that make sense? Things that have been nagging you, bothering you, they occupy your shower thoughts. That sort of thing. Take 30 seconds, see if you can find such a thing in your own life, in your own experience of the world at large.&nbsp;Go.</p><p>Nice. Okay, I'd like you to take a moment, and imagine the universe in which I don't say anything else, and you have eighteen minutes just siting in this room in silence to invent your own rationality. To actually take, \"Okay, Duncan's laid out some principles, and some threads that I can pull on.\" I want you to connect with the world where you in fact tug on those threads, and go forth and try to do something to tinker with your life on some level, or maybe on all the&nbsp;levels.</p><p>Can you imagine, in other words, can you imagine yourself taking these last 40 minutes and actually having a better life as a result? Take 10 seconds. If your hand is down here, this is, \"I can't imagine it. That's dissonant, it doesn't make sense, it doesn't feel like how the world works.\" And if your hand is up here it's like, \"Yes, I can see that, I'm excited about it. That feels real.\" Nope to yep.&nbsp;Cool.</p><p>Now I want you to imagine the world in which\u2026 let's see, it's June right now. Imagine it's September, and you've literally never again touched on anything that I talked about for the last 40 minutes. It's never come to mind, it's never been useful, it's never come in handy. You've done nothing with it. Imagine that world for a moment. How surprising is that world? Nope is like, \"That's incoherent. I can't possibly imagine.\" This is like, \"Yeah, that's the real&nbsp;world.\"</p><p>Okay. So in response to those dual imaginings, I have one thing to say, and I bet you already know what it is. Do you know what you are doing, and why you are doing it? Right. If there is useful content here, and you expect not to do anything with it, then like, \"How about that?\" Right. It's important that it be like this. It's important that it not be like, \"I, fucking, again\u2026 I wasted my tools!\" Because that's ignoring the parts of you that are leading you on your normal track. Your everyday autopilot is actually pretty darn good,&nbsp;right?</p><p>It's gotten you this far, and you don't want to just spit on that. Does that make sense? So not like, \"Gosh, once again I didn't do what I intended to do.\" But more like, \"I did\u2026\" Here I'm projecting, hopefully, \"I did think there was useful stuff in Duncan's talk, but I can see myself never doing anything about it. What's up with that?\" Right? That's the question that I want you to hold and&nbsp;ask.</p><p>And the way that I want you to hold and ask it is, do you know what you are doing, and why you are doing it? I want to pop up all the time for the rest of your life in annoying fashion. I want you to be walking down the street, and then little Duncan pops up on your shoulders like \"Do you know what you're doing, and why you're doing it?\" Next time you're eating the Oreos, next time you're road raging, next time you're getting in a fight with your manager, I'm going to pop up. I'm going to be there. It's going to be hideously&nbsp;annoying.</p><p>You guys are going to email me five years from now. You'll be like, \"It's still happening.\" Do you know what you are doing, and why you are doing it? That's the key question. Makes sense? Cool. So all that being said, all of the how you should invent your own rationality, and how you should do this work yourself. By the way, if you don't want to do the work yourself, come to a CFAR workshop. They're super dope, and we will give you all the&nbsp;techniques.</p><p>But just in case. Just in case you never make it to a CFAR workshop, you now have the beginnings that you can follow up on should you choose to, and should you be able to figure out how. I'm give you one last lens. This is actually one of our techniques. TAPs, Trigger Action&nbsp;Planning.</p><p>Normally we spend over an hour teaching and working on this. So, again, I'm sort of just giving you the key, and you have to go further yourself. But hopefully this will be a useful tool for you to take away with you. If you want to learn more about TAPs, Trigger Action Planning, you want to look up implementation intentions. The reason we call them TAPs instead of implementation intentions, is when we call them implementation intentions everybody refused to learn them, and rated them at 3 out of&nbsp;10.</p><p>When we started calling them TAPs, everybody loved them and glommed onto them. And it was like, \"This is the best technique!\" So we call them TAPs. Humans, go figure, right. But okay, here is the core of TAPS. You ready? I'm not very good at faking sneezes, but if I were to&nbsp;sneeze\u2026</p><p><i>Audience</i>: God bless&nbsp;you.</p><p>Right. So there's this immediate if/then that happens in your brain. Trigger/action, stimulus/response. When you hear \"shave and a haircut\" your brain is like, \"I know the answer, the answer is two bits!\" Right? When somebody sneezes your brain is like, \"I know what I'm supposed to do here.\" And this has accumulated. Some of these TAPs, some of these Trigger Action \u2026 This acronym is overloaded. This also stands for Trigger Action&nbsp;Patterns.</p><p>Some of these Trigger Action Patterns in your brain, some are there from biology, right, like the knee reflex. That's just there. That's a TAP that you didn't put there, your body just has that. Some of them are learned. Have you ever had the\u2026 let's see, I'm going to draw this real quick. Yes, ever had the experience of you're waiting at a stop light, and there's the turn left lane, and there's the go straight lane, and here's you in your&nbsp;car.</p><p>You're going straight at the stop light. And this little green arrow comes on, and your foot comes off the brake. Nod your head if you've had this experience. Because your brain has learned, a flash of green in your visual field when you're at a stop light, that means it's time to go. But uh-oh. Your TAPs can be more or less calibrated. They can be more or less&nbsp;appropriate.</p><p>Nod your head if you've ever gotten caught in the loop where somebody is like, \"How are you?\" And you're like, \"I'm fine, and you?\" And they're like, \"I'm fine, and you?\" Right? TAP, TAP, TAP. Your brain just chains together these if/then patterns into actually quite astonishingly complex&nbsp;behavior.</p><p>You can run on autopilot through the vast majority of your life, and in fact, you do. This goes back to where I was saying your autopilot's actually pretty darn good. It's super cool. Most of us who drive cars, drive cars almost entirely on autopilot in this way. Unless the traffic is really bad, or it's raining really hard or something, most of the time you're just doing&nbsp;it.</p><p>You can have a conversation with a person. You can be listening to the radio, and you're not even being an irresponsible driver. Your autopilot is actually competent to handle checking your mirrors before you change lanes. But there's this thing that can happen. My colleague, Anna, likes to tell story where she was driving down the highway at about 75 miles an hour. And there was a refrigerator in the lane in front of her. And she says she experienced \"an awakening of&nbsp;sorts\".</p><p>Where she had been on autopilot, but all of a sudden she was conscious. Like, \"What was that? Was that\u2026 that can not possibly have been refrigerator.\" And there's this way in which, sort of like the Tesla autopilot assist. Like the self-driving cars that we currently have will be like, \"Hey, driver, wake up, put your hands on the wheel.\" They'll call on the human at the appropriate&nbsp;moment.</p><p>Anna's autopilot summoned Anna, the conscious, verbal, explicit Anna. This make sense? It called her attention up. And this is one of the things that we want our autopilot to be able to do. There are two things that I want you to think about with your autopilot. One, where is miscalibrated. Where is your autopilot generating the wrong suggestions, the wrong actions. And two, when do you want your autopilot to turn itself&nbsp;off?</p><p>My colleague Val likes to refer to this as the summon sapiens spell. You can actually program into your autopilot, triggers for turning the autopilot off, and bringing conscious you online. In the case of Anna, it was accidental. It was just a refrigerator in the middle of the highway. But you can build up yourself some reminders. One of my favorite examples here, is they used Trigger Action Planning, under the name implementation intentions, as an intervention of ADHD middle schoolers, and it worked as well as medication, which is shocking and astonishing. This is actually real psychology, hundreds of studies, large effect sizes, and it passed the replication&nbsp;crisis.</p><p>This is still real, even after the replication crisis. What they did, imagine an ADHD middle schooler\u2026 this story that I'm now telling is somewhat made up and apocryphal. This is not literally what happened in the study. You should go read the study if you're interested. But this is sort of like the Sunday school version of the story. You've got a middle schooler who's just always losing track, they're just always off-task. And they're like, \"I don't know. I don't know what happened,\" Like, \"Okay, here's what we're going to do. Every time you notice that you're off track, every time your brain naturally comes to attention, I want you to review as much as you can of the last 30 seconds.\" That's it, just try to remember what was going on for the last 30&nbsp;seconds.</p><p>And the first time you do this the middle schooler is like, \"Okay. I notice I'm off track. I was staring out the window, and before that, I got nothing.\" And you're like, \"That's okay, that's okay, good job. You got the first step. High five.\" And then they keep practicing this. And they're like, \"Okay, I was passing a note to Carl, and before that I was looking out the window, and before that I dropped my pencil, and before that, I was paying attention. Yeah, I was paying&nbsp;attention.\"</p><p>You're like, \"Okay, your pencil fell off the desk, and that's what distracted you.\" And then again, the next day is like, \"Okay, well, I was tapping my foot under the desk, and then before that I was looking over at Suzie because she coughed, and before that, I was paying attention.\" And you start to build up this pattern of like, \"Ah-ha, what's happening for this kid is noises pull them off task,\" right. When they hear a noise, they get distracted. And so, then you can build in a new set of Trigger Action Patterns. This is what a Trigger Action Plan is, is when you devise a Trigger Action Pattern. Either by replacing an action, or by building a wholesale new TAP, and you eventually get it embedded into your&nbsp;system.</p><p>Now this kid can be like, \"Okay, here's what I'm going to do. When I hear a noise\u2026\" That catches their attention already, right, \"When I hear a noise I will\u2026\" What do you think. They shouldn't just focus\u2026 they shouldn't be like, \"When I hear a noise I will ignore it, and I will focus on the teacher,\" because that's fighting human nature,&nbsp;right?</p><p>But, \"When I hear a noise, I will investigate its source, and once I know what it was, I will look back at the board.\" You can build up this TAP, you can build up this pattern, and this effectively, like, bam, ADHD cut in half. There's still ADHD, but at least this one problem is somewhat solved. They can come back to the&nbsp;board.</p><p>In particular, they're not fighting their own like, \"I'm distracted.\" What they're doing is they're practicing the movement of returning their attention where they want it to be. Like the thing where people meditate, you're not supposed to fight yourself from thinking thoughts. You just think the thought, but then come back to your meditative state. You're practicing staying in the&nbsp;flow.</p><p>So, the shape of TAPS is just looking at what your autopilot is doing. Does it make sense? By looking at the triggers, looking at the actions. \"When my significant other makes that face, I ramp up and start yelling. That's bad. When somebody cuts me off in traffic, I immediately narrativize that they're a bad person. When I have a package of Oreos in front of me, I put them in my mouth until they're all gone,\"&nbsp;right?</p><p>So this is a lens that you can use to look at your behavior, and then very carefully, very slowly, tinker. Now, a little bit of a word of warning. As you tinker, be careful and kind to yourself. CFAR used to recommend for people that wanted more exercise like, \"Okay, you work on the fifth floor of a building. How about, let's try a TAP where when you get to work in the morning you take the stairs instead of the&nbsp;elevator.\"</p><p>And it turned out that the TAP that people were installing was, \"When I get on the elevator I will feel guilty about not taking the stairs.\" This is bad. In fact, what you want to do is not use your TAPS as like a bludgeon against future you. What you want to do is have them be like a little dialogue box popping up like, \"Hey, you had a goal of taking the stairs. Would you like to take the stairs?\" That's what you're looking&nbsp;for.</p><p>You're looking for the autopilot to catch your attention, turn itself off, and bring conscious you into the frame. And then conscious you should make a choice. And if it turns out over the course of a week that your TAP does in fact fire. Every time you open the door to your building you're like, \"Oh, yes, take the stairs.\" If it turns out that your TAP fires every day and you took the stairs zero times, that just means that you have a problem that's not solved by TAPs. Does that make sense? It means that you're like, \"I thought that taking the stairs would be a good plan, but every single time the opportunity arose there was some resistance, or some problem.\" That means that you need goal factoring, which you can learn from a CFAR&nbsp;workshop.</p><p>So what I'd like to do with this last couple of minutes. First, I'd like everybody to take a minute, and I just want you to look at your own autopilot. Just try to see what TAPs you have. Do you have the tap of like, \"I'm bored on Facebook,\" close Facebook, open new tab, open Facebook? So walk through your day, or look at life domains. What TAPs do you have surrounding exercise? What TAPs do you have when you talk to your friends? What TAPs do you have around&nbsp;eating?</p><p>I want to take 90 seconds. I just want you to look at the autopilot. See if you can notice these if/then patterns at all. Sometimes they're hard to spot. Go ahead. Nice. I'm actually going to hold questions for office hours. I have office hours in the co-working space from 1:00 to 1:30. And if you want to ask more about this stuff, or CFAR in general, or anything at all really, please feel free to come to&nbsp;those.</p><p>My last point that I want to make, you're going to walk out of this room, and everything's going to fall out of your head. You're going to drop right back into your normal autopilot. You're going to see people, you're going to go to the bathroom, \"Where's my next talk?\" And this is fine. This is fine. You don't have to be conscious all the time. Autopilots are really good. But there's one question that I want you to keep in mind, and I want you to keep hearing it in my annoying voice. I want it to keep happening forever, for the rest of your life. Will you say it with me? \"Do you know what you're doing, and why you are doing&nbsp;it?\"</p><p>If you keep hold of that question you will be improving your rationality all the time. Thanks&nbsp;everyone.</p>", "user": {"username": "The Centre for Effective Altruism"}}, {"_id": "cGkqYFF6TYbWfm8S9", "title": "Kelly Witwicki and Kieran Greig: Animal advocacy strategies \u2014 technology vs. social change", "postedAt": "2018-06-08T07:15:00.000Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipuKfcB9DhY&amp;list=PLwp9xeoX5p8P3cDQwlyN7qsFhC9Ms4L5W&amp;index=28\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ipuKfcB9DhY\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><hr><p><i>If we want to help farmed animals, there are at least two clear avenues to pursue. One, we can promote technologies to replace farming, like plant-based or clean (cultured) meat. Or two, we can try to change social attitudes towards the moral standing of animals. Does either of this options seem much better than the other? In this talk from EA Global 2018: San Francisco, Kelly Witwicki and Kieran Greig discuss the relevant considerations.</i></p><p><i>A lightly edited transcript of Kelly and Kieran's talk is below, followed by a question from the&nbsp;audience. You can also watch it on </i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipuKfcB9DhY&amp;list=PLwp9xeoX5p8P3cDQwlyN7qsFhC9Ms4L5W&amp;index=28\"><i>YouTube</i></a><i> and read it on </i><a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/ea-global-2018-animal-advocacy/\"><i>effectivealtruism.org</i></a><i>.</i></p><h1>The Talk</h1><p><i>Kieran</i>: Before we go into the considerations for and against tech change versus social change, I think we're going to first start off with a number of qualifications in order to narrow down on exactly what we are going to be discussing. The first thing is for technological development, we're just going to be constrained to food tech, so particularly plant-based alternatives and clean meat. I know there're other things we could consider, so things like virtual reality, or we could get a lot more speculative about things like artificial intelligence or potentially gene editing, but we're just really not going to go into those things. So it's just focused on food tech, plant-based foods, and clean&nbsp;meat.</p><p><i>Kelly</i>: And I'm going to be talking about social change/advocacy. I might use those interchangeably. We're talking about the things that the animal advocacy community right now thinks are priorities, so things like strong corporate or legislative reforms, things like personhood initiatives to get basic rights for some species, or for some individuals of non-human species. And possibly also work that affects society's attitudes towards farmed animals, towards animal farming, and towards animal farming alternatives. So there's a lot of range in there. This could include supportive documentaries and non-fiction film and television, but just assume that we're talking about the best things in the clean meat, plant-based food tech space and the best things in the advocacy space. So clean chicken meat to strong reforms or personhood initiatives, not like clean suede and, I don't know, whatever advocacy we think is&nbsp;ineffective.</p><p>So just assume we're talking about the top things because some of this, obviously in practice some of these considerations come down to, well this is a bad tech idea and this is a good advocacy idea, so in this talk we're only considering good advocacy and tech ideas. Also, to qualify, these are considerations for how we should divide and prioritize our resources as a movement, and where the marginal value is. So in practice, an individual's comparative advantage might matter a lot. If you have a degree in tissue engineering, you should probably just go work in food tech, but if you're the kind of person who could be a really strong entrepreneur or a really strong advocate, this is more of an open question for&nbsp;you.</p><p>These are very highly speculative topics and we're relying on pretty weak evidence in either direction, so really no one should come away from this with a strong opinion of whether in general we should be putting more into tech or more into advocacy, you should really have a weak leaning either way. And last couple of qualifications, that we're not each taking a side, we're going to each talk about some considerations for advocacy and for tech, generally just the ones that we each find strongest on either side. And we're going through some very loaded and complicated considerations so we're so sorry if we don't have time to explain some&nbsp;things.</p><p><i>Kieran</i>: I think another really important thing to acknowledge is that there's obviously really complex and important interactions between the two, so the approaches are complementary. If we do make technological progress, and make social progress easier by changing attitudes, we also increase demand for the technological progress. Definitely that's worth considering and neither of us are saying that it's either/or, obviously it's how much do we want of this versus how much do we want of that. I think the other thing I would say on this is obviously that once people have stopped eating animals, it does seem like it would be easier to change their attitudes towards&nbsp;animals.</p><p>And I think the final point I would make here is that historically, there does seem to be a relationship between technological progress and social change. So for instance, and I don't have great sense of this but I've heard cases where the technological change seems to have driven the social change, so for example, with the eradication of the horse and cart by the automobile, with the decimation of whaling by changes in how we source oil. There's also examples around female empowerment through contraception, opposition to the Vietnam war through televised images. Yeah and I think I'll leave it at that for&nbsp;now.</p><p><i>Kelly</i>: And this is one of our first cruxes and disagreements. I think those particular examples, teasing out the causation is very challenging because we do expect there to be a cyclical effect. In the case of animal farming, we have these studies suggesting that if you're thinking about eating animals or if you're eating animals, you think they're less morally valuable than you otherwise would, so we should expect therefore that once people are eating more clean meat, plant-based meat, they will be more receptive to animal friendly attitudes. So that's the kind of effect that can have and then in the opposite direction, we have things like, if people care about the animals more, they're going to want this technology&nbsp;more.</p><p>But teasing out the causation historically between tech change and advocacy change, I think is hard. It just seems like maybe the best we can say is like, there is causation in both directions and of course we also have examples where it seems like the tech definitely just followed morality. Like clean energy and electric cars and a lot of technology changes that have to do with the environmentalist movement, seem much more driven by morality and interest in climate change than just pure interest in efficiency. So as I said, don't think of us as taking a side, we'll just clarify what each point is&nbsp;for.</p><p>So, here's a point in favor of advocacy. Basically tech doesn't go backwards like social change can. once we've developed a technology, we know how to use it, we can use it, but social change is harder to say that's going to stick around. If we work on technology and bring the tech faster, then what we're doing is adding value between when the tech comes and when it would have come, but our end states are equally good in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>If we instead work on advocacy, that changes the direction of the future, and not just the speed with which it comes, because we expect the technology to eventually come anyway but we don't expect social change to necessarily happen if we don't work on it. Then instead what's happening is at this time, when we start making the clean meat, if we're also doing this advocacy then maybe we can push up the change higher, and then we end up with a higher value long-term world. So that's a big consideration in favor of working on social change instead of tech, and we just think the tech might happen without us&nbsp;anyways.</p><p>A counter consideration, however, is that tech itself could be an efficient way to achieve that change because we reduce the dissonance and then maybe that helps us actually get social&nbsp;change.</p><p><i>Kieran</i>: Yeah, sure. So I think that counter consideration is important. So, if we do take into account that the tech change could be the thing that is driving the social change, and that tech unlike social change can't go backwards, I think that the timeline, versus the direction change, to me doesn't seem to clearly point in favor of focusing on social&nbsp;change.</p><p><i>Kelly</i>: Sure, so for one specific example of why this could be the case, let's say we expect value lock in to happen some time soon. For what value lock in means, basically just assume there's some kind of world, maybe like Artificial General Intelligence develops, and just for whatever reason, our values at that time matter a lot, they extend into the future from that point. Then we maybe want to make sure that we speed up value change as fast as possible as much as possible, maybe in exchange for what would otherwise be more robust, stronger, longer-term&nbsp;change.</p><p>And of course some tech might offer quicker improvement to that, so maybe aggressively rolling out clean meat chicken nuggets reduces cognitive dissonance more than taking the time to develop whole chickens' bodies with bones and special connective tissue and everything. And maybe that's the 80/20 of the tech that we can do for social change, but of course there may also be other ways to work against speciesist prejudice that have higher near-term returns even if we'd expect them to have lower returns relative to other strategies in the long-term, which could be things like maybe focusing on dramatic changes, like rights of personhood for some animal. Maybe that's just what we would want to do if we thought value lock in was going to come really soon. So we could just make sure we're pushing that speciesist barrier as fast as possible, even if not as long-term effectively as possible were value lock in not to&nbsp;happen.</p><p>We're really trying to run through a lot of things here, so excuse us for just going so, so quickly. I missed something just earlier that I want to make a point on. With advocacy, there's a consideration that maybe before our advocacy efforts can even have any promise, we need to get to a point where we have the same products that we're consuming now, and just have a different production process. So that there's no actual trade off for the end user, for the consumer, which might mean that we just want to get the tech to as strong a place as we can right now and then do the advocacy. Then go for the political change once we have the identical products, just with a different production&nbsp;process.</p><p><i>Kieran</i>: Yeah, so just to jump back to the value lock in consideration. So I think one thing that affects my view here is that it seems like a low probability scenario, but potentially a really high value scenario. I think the other thing which I would be wary of there is potentially if we are trying to advance social change really quickly and perhaps using more aggressive tactics, whatever that would be, you are attempting to achieve personhood for certain nonhuman animals. I think there's some potential for there to be short term negative effects of that, and I think I'd just be aware of that when we are making that decision. And I think the other thing that I would say on this is just that, again, if we do suspect that there is going to be this value lock in scenario in the somewhat near future, that the tech lever might still be the best lever to pull on in order to achieve the social change, and it's not necessarily that the social change lever would be the best to pull&nbsp;on.</p><p><i>Kelly</i>: Yeah, yeah so we want to make those chicken nuggets and reduce that dissonance or something like&nbsp;that.</p><p><i>Kieran</i>: Yeah. Another consideration which informs my opinion on this, would be that in general, I think that the comparative advantage of advocates is going to be doing advocacy, which requires care and empathy for animals. For tech change, I think we're generally just going to be more replaceable. We'd be able to have scientists or other people who don't necessarily care about animals but they are motivated by profits and that sort of thing, they could potentially work on those things whereas for us if we do care about animals, our comparative advantage seems to an area which would require that&nbsp;care.</p><p><i>Kelly</i>: And of course, that could also mean that we would see very high returns by starting tech projects, because maybe we're the most motivated in starting them but then investors and consumers can go take it from us once we've started it. This same consideration is also a general argument for the relative tractability of tech development so maybe we're more replaceable, but maybe it's also more tractable. You can see why we think you should only really lean weakly one way or the other, because these are all quite speculative considerations that just lean one way or the other a little bit. Nothing is very strong here, nothing is \"Okay well this is obvious, we should be over&nbsp;here.\"</p><p>Something I've been thinking a bit about lately is that it's possible that humanity's moral circle mostly includes humans, most of us more or less, and then it kind of goes gray out into like, okay we care quite a bit about dogs and cats in the US, we care a little bit about pigs and chickens right now. At least we don't like factory farming. We don't really care about insects, we don't really care about digital minds yet, so they're further away from the moral&nbsp;circle.</p><p>And one consideration for working on tech instead of advocacy is that it's possible that the moral circle just has a set point, and it's just going to trend towards some particular point, it's not going to be able to expand forever. If there is a set point, it's probably focused around powerful beings and it's probably, if there is such a set point, it's likely to be a place where those who are included are those who you can get a lot out of, and those who are excluded are the ones who are a burden to take care for, who don't really give you anything in return. You just have to care for, like, children who are just always going to be children, aren't going to end up being productive to your society and the things that you want out of your&nbsp;life.</p><p>And that will probably mean that maybe our moral circle stops at humans, or it's just a lot harder to get past humans because humans of different ethnicities, having reduced racism means lower conflict and that's great for us. But maybe just including chickens is not necessarily great for us, it's only great for the chickens. So that would be then a reason just for thinking that the advocacy is less tractable and therefore we want to work more on the&nbsp;tech.</p><p><i>Kieran</i>: Yeah so that's a really interesting point on this potential set point to a moral circle expansion. I think that for me, there seems to be just a large amount of uncertainty and speculation involved in whether there is a set point, and if there is a set point, where that set point is. So I find that for me, that is not one of the considerations which is most informing my opinion here. Obviously, it is definitely a consideration and we should definitely take that into account, but I think that something that I find more informative is that for clean meat, I think there are significant questions around whether we can achieve cost competitiveness with farmed animal&nbsp;products.</p><p>So there's been one report from the Open Philanthropy Project, there's also been a paper published on this by Van der Weele and Tramper in 2014, and the basic thesis here is that, with clean meat, you need a growth medium for the cells to proliferate, and the minimum costs of the growth medium currently are such that clean meat just can't become cost competitive. So I think at the minimum costs we're looking at something like $8 per kilogram and factory farmed animal products are just\u2026 they're literally a fraction of that right now. But on the other hand, there are proponents, companies working in this area. So for example, Hampton Creek reported that they would have clean meat in restaurants by 2018. Another group recently reported that by the end of 2018, the prices would be at $8 per kilogram. And yeah, I think I'll go with&nbsp;that.</p><p><i>Kelly</i>: So this going to get at, I think, a major crux on some of these considerations, but basically clean meat should necessarily become cheaper than animal meat in the long term because it necessarily involves less energy in terms of the physical constraints of the universe. If you're growing an entire individual, you have to develop their brain and their immune system, I mean they might need some kind of immune system for clean meat, but we don't need to create a sentient intelligent brain. It feels like we can skip that part, we can skip the skeleton, so that's a lot of processes that just don't need to be part of the clean meat process. So theoretically, given enough technological advancement, the physical constraints of the universe suggest that this is what should happen eventually, maybe that's in 100 years, maybe it's 1,000 years. But it should happen eventually, which gets us to the crux&nbsp;here.</p><p>If you discount your uncertain impacts a lot, however far away they are, if they're farther into the future, if they're further away in space, if you think your uncertain impacts are things you should just discount basically down to zero or somewhere close to that, then you may be more interested in the next few decades. Because of that, you\u2026 well, that can go different ways on some of these considerations. But for this particular consideration, it might mean that you want to work on the advocacy and not the tech, because you don't think the tech is going to come in the next few decades. But if you are more interested in the very long term, and you don't discount that uncertainty, the uncertainty of 1,000 years from now, of the impacts that you can make 1,000 years from now, then you may be more interested in pursuing the technology because you think it's going to happen at least sometime before&nbsp;then.</p><p>And that goes for a few of the other considerations here, so log that if that's something that you\u2026 if you regularly either go towards the near-term stuff or the far-term stuff, that could make the decision much more clear for you, which way it should go, one or the other. We have a couple other considerations, we may not have time for questions but let's try to get through this quickly so we can do one or&nbsp;two.</p><p>One of the considerations for advocacy is that many existing animal product replacements are very high quality, and yet only a small part of the population is vegan, and our animal product consumption continues to rise. So that suggests that just making the technology good enough isn't enough, we need advocacy around it. We need to make people excited about it in order to get it adopted because just having the technology isn't&nbsp;enough.</p><p><i>Kieran</i>: I'm not sure if they are high quality. So I have talked to people who feel like they kind of clearly don't taste like meat, or this is clearly different from the taste of milk. I think the other thing is that the ones which do seem to be high quality do tend to be more expensive, and this is just\u2026 this basic economics is one of the factors which determine what people buy, if the alternatives are more expensive, then people are going to buy them less. So we can drive the costs down by further technological development, then yeah, this could potentially make progress a lot&nbsp;easier.</p><p>So I think the final consideration for me is that there are axes other than tech versus social change which I find are informing my opinion here. So when I'm thinking about possible donation targets on the social change side versus the technological development side, it feels like there are other just very relevant differences between them, so the track record of certain organizations seems to be stronger on the advocacy side. I can look at something like THL which has been around for a number of years and I can feel more confident in them. When I look at the technological development side, these are just new startups, they have a very limited track&nbsp;record.</p><p><i>Kieran</i>: Similarly, I feel more confident on the advocacy side in terms of how advocates have responded to signs of success and failure, and being able to update their approach in light of those things. I feel less confident that the tech side of things is going to be able to do that. Yeah, so I find that there's just these other relevant dimensions than the tech versus social change dichotomy, which is also informing my opinion here. And they do seem to be importantly different between the two options and I thought I would highlight&nbsp;that.</p><p><i>Kelly</i>: Well there you go, sorry we don't have any answers for you and left you just more&nbsp;confused.</p><h1>Q&amp;A</h1><p><i>Question</i>: Your argument about the long-term future being better with advocacy than with tech suggests that everyone will eventually switch to clean meat or plant-based meat. Do you think that there will still be a large percentage of the population that will continue eating non-plant-based meat? And if so, how&nbsp;much?\u201d</p><p><i>Kelly</i>: So there are a couple of things in this, obviously these graphs are oversimplifications, but I think it's unlikely that literally just developing the tech itself is going to be enough. There have been plenty of other technologies that were not adopted because advocacy got in the way or people's attitudes got in the way. Even though it's a better technology, nuclear energy got to 80% of the grid in France, only 20% in the US. We don't want the same kind of thing to happen to clean meat. We don't want clean meat to be banned like GMOs are because people are just more afraid of cell-based meat than they are of factory farms. That would suck. So we want to do advocacy work to make sure that happens. I think if we literally just weren't doing any advocacy, I would not expect the entire world to adopt clean meat. Anytime soon at least, maybe in the long run. It is more efficient, so it probably would happen eventually, so this maybe is partially just a speed&nbsp;consideration.</p><p>But when I say advocacy, I also mean things to expand the moral circle more broadly. So not just talking about what's literally going to get animals switched off of people's plates for cell-based or plant-based products, but also what's going to make them care more about those animals so that they don't hurt them in other ways, what's going to make them care more about other minds so that other problems can get solved too. And I think if we have this moral emphasis around the way we end animal farming, if we end animal farming, not just because it's more efficient but we have this advocacy going with it that's like, we're doing this because we care about the animals, it just also is really easy for you to believe that now that we have the technology and are making it easy for you, then that affects people's attitudes and helps us keep expanding that circle to protect more&nbsp;people.</p>", "user": {"username": "The Centre for Effective Altruism"}}, {"_id": "RNPGdmjMt3puZhXLF", "title": "Gregory Lewis and Oliver Habryka: Trusting experts", "postedAt": "2018-06-08T07:15:00.000Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDlj2S2DWwQ&amp;list=PLwp9xeoX5p8P3cDQwlyN7qsFhC9Ms4L5W&amp;index=27&amp;t=31s\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/RDlj2S2DWwQ\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><hr><p><i>If you have one opinion, and the prevailing experts have a different opinion, should you assume that you\u2019re incorrect?

In this whiteboard discussion from Effective Altruism Global 2018: San Francisco, Gregory Lewis and Oliver Habryka offer their contrasting perspectives.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Below is a transcript Gregory and Oliver's talk, which we have lightly edited for&nbsp;clarity. You can also watch it on </i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDlj2S2DWwQ&amp;list=PLwp9xeoX5p8P3cDQwlyN7qsFhC9Ms4L5W&amp;index=27&amp;t=31s\"><i>YouTube</i></a><i> and read it on </i><a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/ea-global-2018-trusting-experts/\"><i>effectivealtruism.org</i></a><i>.</i></p><h1>The Talk</h1><p><i>Gregory</i>: Probably what we are going to try and do is, I'm going to explain to you why I'm right and then\u2026 I'm joking. I'm going to probably set up my stool for the discussion about whether or not to defer when someone's come in the community to discuss epistemic modesty. I guess Ollie will&nbsp;then\u2026</p><p><i>Oliver</i>: Bring my perspective into it, contrast it a bit, and that will be a starting point for the whole&nbsp;discussion.</p><p><i>Gregory</i>: By way of introduction, there's many cases where deferring to what other people think, or people are who are maybe more informed than you think, is pretty inarguable and pretty obvious. I think that's common knowledge amongst most people here. A common example given is, you know, if you're taking your bins out or taking the trash out on a particular day of a week and you see none of your neighbors have left their trash out on the same day of a week, you probably think like, \"I've made a mistake here\" rather than \"everyone else's made a mistake.\" And then change your mind because of that. And likely if you read a textbook and you see something in that it looks a little bit surprising to you it's probably more likely that you just don't understand it rather than the textbook makes a mistake. That doesn't mean textbooks are infallible, but I mean you should probably like\u2026 if you have to guess which one's right, you or the textbook, you should probably guess the textbook in most&nbsp;cases.</p><p>So that's all the really inarguable stuff, which I think Ollie is going to be arguing against very vociferously for the next hour. Alas for me. But where it gets a little more complicated, there's lots of areas where we do often take ourselves or license ourselves to disagree. So like in politics, in various complicated factual matters, in religion and all sorts of other things besides. And there we think, even if they're experts, we still think we are within our rights epistemically to go actually these guys are wrong and we're right. I guess my view on this is like, I'm probably like a modesty radical, immodestly modest, you might say, insofar as I think, in essence, what you should always do in each possible condition of things is you should hew your own view towards an idealized expert consensus. So you weigh up different expert classes, work out which ones are more relevant, and do all of that stuff. And then you get an answer based on&nbsp;that.</p><p>And that's what you should think is actually true. So your credence should be driven by this, and your own personal impression of where the balance of reason lies counts in most cases for virtually nothing. It counts no more than another person similarly well informed as you, coming to the view they have. And so that typically means in my day to day life, I end up sort of deferring quite a lot. And so, I don't have a particularly strong political views or like, hot button topics because the fact there is controversy means I probably shouldn't be very confident that one side is right or the other and so on and so forth. I guess the EA relevance of this is in many cases, EAs do take views which like outside side or often against expert consensus, and how often is that a reasonable thing to do or not reasonable? And obviously given my own ideology here, I tend to be leaning in favor of thinking that the EA community should be a lot more cautious and more deferential to existing bodies of expertise. So that's like me as it were setting out my stool. I look forward to Ollie pelting me with rotten fruit, as appropriate. I'll hand over to him for a&nbsp;bit.</p><p><i>Oliver</i>: I think ultimately a lot of what Greg said is right. I think there is an important sense in which it is obviously really important to take in due account other people's epistemic states and other people's observations, and their current opinions in forming your own opinions. But I think there are various problems with trying to do this naively. I think the perspective that I'm taking, is not necessarily have something deeply flawed with something like the complete, philosophically rigorous view of what Greg is saying, but more something where I'm saying that if you do naively the thing that Greg recommends people do, you will end up running into various problems, and I think these problems are kind of illustrated by three of the topics we hope to cover today. There is the question of who are you going to count as an expert, which is I think is underlying just if I'm going to go by expert consensus there is this key question of, who I will let trust as an expert? In questions of religion should I trust theologians? They seem to have thought most about it. Does mean that God definitely exists given that most theologians seem to think God exists? But then we are like, ah, maybe philosophers. So we have this interesting question of who do we trust as our&nbsp;experts?</p><p>Similar, a related question is when are you yourself an expert? At what point do you cross the threshold to think that you are the world expert on a relevant topic? Maybe you are the person who has done the most research in the world of all the people that exist into a certain form of quantum mechanics or in certain questions about online discussion platform design (which I hope I have achieved). And in those situations, I think that is just a question where I expect where if you do the modest thing, and if you kind of carry forward the attitude of modesty into that situation, you will usually make bad&nbsp;decisions.</p><p>And third of all, there are important second order effects, where if you have a group of people who are generally primarily making decisions based on other people's opinions, you run into many, many information cascade problems that we often see in markets, often see in various real life situations, panics, where everyone else is primarily paying attention to what everyone else does. And then you get stuff like bystander effect, you get stampede and stuff like that. And that is a problem that I think can be avoided with very rigorous and careful thinking about how other people came to their opinions. But it's something that if you're going to naively take the modesty stance, I think you're going to be on average doing worst than I expect most people in this room to be doing. Okay. I think those are my three big perspectives and objections that I have with the broader framework because I think philosophically, I agree with a lot of things that Greg says, but I think the question is more about, how are we going to actually implement these insights about epistemology and&nbsp;understanding.</p><p><i>Gregory</i>: Can we go with the first things first, maybe? So the question of what counts as expertise. Right? And so I often, in fact, I've written at length, at great length on modesty online. My idea is, I often like to use is that maybe somewhat loosely, subject matter expertise is basically the same thing as expertise per se. So to answer \"is it good to have a death penalty\" look for people who work in criminal justice, is a good to increase or decrease minimum wage, maybe we should talk to economists, I say as one enters the room just now. If you want to know if you're sick or not maybe consult a physician. I think there were many cases where people would agree that's a useful first pass&nbsp;heuristic.</p><p>But there's a key question as to, in many cases it seems like this often co-locates with social status. So I used to be a doctor, doctors have this quite good reputation, present company notwithstanding, and that means that you're taken maybe more seriously than you deserve to be. There are like lots of stories actually in medicine going further where people are overly deferential to doctors who are doing really stupid things. Or like the nurse, who is not in the same high status profession the doctor is, sort of let people like me make terrible mistakes and cause damage. So that's obviously like where it can go wrong and definitely what I would want to&nbsp;avoid.</p><p>The question is we have some data, some interesting data Ollie wanted to cover. So I'm stealing his thunder, on where very simple scoring rules can beat commercial expertise. So there was like reason rules from Kahneman, there's prediction markets and all of this stuff. And so it seems you don't necessarily need lots of subject matter knowledge, beyond being an academic, being a professor, to actually get better answers than the supposed expert class. Do you want to elaborate more on that, so I'm not making your point before you can do an even better job of what I'm attempting to&nbsp;do.</p><p><i>Oliver</i>: I think like one of the most interesting questions that illustrates this most is the super forecasting literature, where you have this interesting thing where you have the super forecasters trying to make judgments about global politics, trying to make judgments about technological advances. And those are people without subject matter expertise. They are people who usually are generally well read, and can do Wikipedia searches, and then just try to apply kind of good forms of\u2026 good rules of reasoning, that are pretty domain general, like they don't really depend on a specific domain. And in the super forecasting literature, that has shown to very often outperform experts. And now you have this problem where like okay we now\u2026 we have the experts are forecasting, which we can think of as kind of the experts at answering certain forms of predictive questions. And we have domain experts who are hopefully good at answering domain expertise questions. But when domains widows intersect, which is quite a bit obviously, we are kind of stuck if we try to do naive expert&nbsp;aggregation.</p><p><i>Gregory</i>: I think it's worth\u2026 maybe just on the second point. So it's obviously the case that if you're trying to defer in the epistemic sense, your criteria for expertise is just like predictive accuracy. So in a world where the super forecasters and intelligent analysts are predicting something and you know the super forecaster has got a better track record, even if the analysts have a higher social status, the modest thing is to go with the super forecasters and not with the intelligence analysts. The problem is, of course, that we may find, which we may go on to later, is that maybe the general skills required to make good predictions about various events is like this single key skill, and doesn't really have very much to do with particular domains of expert knowledge, and so it shouldn't be like deferring very much to these sorts of&nbsp;people.</p><p>I guess my own view, to like till my hand preemptively, is that although it may be the case for your super forecasting, you might be able to sort of take issue with intelligence services or similar things like that, if you're a typical person in the audience, you're probably not a super forecaster. And so even if there's even better people out there, you should be deferring to, instead of an expert class, a typical subject matter expert has got advantages over you, or so I would hope, but that may lead us into the next thing a little bit too early. On which, more&nbsp;later.</p><p>I guess the other thing say, that Ollie alluded to, it is a lot harder than it sounds just to defer to the experts because, taking your example further, like if you ask theologians whether God exists, they all agree. If you ask people in general, most people believe God exists, worldwide. That's so-called the common consent argument for God's existence. We also see, but then you go, yeah, fine, but maybe smart people are expert class on this. So you stratify by IQ. People with higher IQs trend atheist compared to general population. Okay. That might be something. But wait a minute, Well, what about philosophers? Philosophers themselves also, philosophers generally also trend atheist. Philosophers of religion, though, who spend lots of time thinking about whether God does or doesn't exist, they actually trend strongly theistic, at least in the&nbsp;US.</p><p>And then you go, well, who should we undercut? You go to underlying features. Maybe like people are really just naturally religious gravitate to philosophy of religion. They weren't persuaded by the arguments, and you can have lots of very complicated discussions over who counts as an expert, and like make a rod for my own back. There's a worry whereby you can liberally gerrymander who you count as an expert to get the answer you wanted to have in the first place. So, weigh these people slightly more highly, and there's lots of fudge factor, so you can twist the dials to, to get the answer you'd like. Obviously, epistemically virtuous people like me would never do anything like that, but you know, better off for the rest of you guys. So whatever. It's harder, it is very hard to do. I would still insist or suggest, I'll suggest it can still be better than trying to strike out on your own and try and form your own impressions of it, which is perhaps where we begin to route back into a topic of&nbsp;disagreements.</p><p><i>Oliver</i>: Yes. So I think one area that I'm curious about kind of exploring, that I think could be really relevant here, is I expect us to have some disagreements about to what degree do we think there are a set of key underlying, think of them as general rationality skills, or you could think of them as general philosophy skills or something like that. Where you can easily imagine a world, and I like to always\u2026 there's a straw man mathematician perspective where you study mathematics, and mathematics has like eight branches. You'll study algebra, you'll study linear algebra, you study some of the more graph theoretic stuff, and now you really have eight models of the world and everything is really just an application of this. Like after you notice eight models, like voting theory, no problem, you just apply some graphs to it. Database design, no problem, you just apply some algebraic constructions to it. And so, there's this idea that we might be living in a world where there are very few simple models that we can generally apply to a lot of different things, and that ultimately expertise in those models dominates the ability to predict accurately in that domain over this specific subject&nbsp;expertise.</p><p>I don't think this is truly as extreme as the naive mathematician's view suggested, but I think it has quite a lot of merit in general, which we see both in super forecasting domain, but also in the domain of thinking rigorously and reasoning rigorously, which isn't necessarily only as an are, a super forecasting domain. I think in many ways I would describe it as something like philosophical competence, where you have a concrete&nbsp;example.</p><p>One of the big problems that I heard Open Phil has often run into, in their discussions with various experts, is they try to make a decision of like how likely are various risks, and they go to the relevant experts and they asked them, \u201chow likely are those risks?\u201d And they answer them with \u201cwell very high.\u201d And you're like, \u201cwell what do you mean with very high?\u201d \"Well, like definitely high.\" And you're like \"is it 50 percent or 70 percent?\" It's like, \u201cI don't know. I can't really put a number on it. High.\u201d And you end up kind of in this situation where, I think there's an important sense in which general skills about how you interact with your beliefs, and even being able to make precise statements about the world that are general in the sense, like, could screen off just the sense of domain expertise. And I expected we probably disagree about the degree to which there is specific domain expertise in detail to these different&nbsp;areas.</p><p><i>Gregory</i>: Like can I just reach the summit of the epistemic function with all creation arrayed before you, is the only way you can make good progress. So that's like, yes. So I think you do anticipate correctly. I'd be like, \"well I'm not entirely sure about that.\" I mean, it seems the case that there's like something which super forecasters have which involves doing lots of different things. They have to be able to predict. There are specialist politics forecasters, there's some of that. They often look quite good in various domains, so definitely the transfer capability set, it's worth saying that they have some background knowledge. They're not usually doing things literally from nothing but it's like not very much, like something like a reasonably low time level expertise, rather than spend like two decades studying like dynamics of politics in a certain&nbsp;area.</p><p>I guess there are also other areas you want to look to besides super forecasting, because like you could say there's like civilizational inadequacy, whereby people aren't trying to protect certain very important events. And so maybe experts haven't really like been trying to develop expertise yet in that area. Well it's like expert performance. It may be the case that it's quite widely separated, so people who are really good at Go on really good at Chess necessarily, or like Poker, and things like that. And we have pretty good evidence that actually, when they can play each other. There's lots of things you'd like to learn, to become really good at chess, which aren't just general skills. Things like IQ and stuff help, but it helps to the degree you'd expect. So I guess my view is that lots of bits of reality have this property whereby you have to like pile in lots and lots of precise knowledge to make good progress in an area. We might just be like at a very early stage of forecasting. It's like in a field where you can become an expert in. Maybe the forthcoming and, one hopes, Tetlock-infication of governments will lead more in that area but who knows? Maybe I'm&nbsp;wrong.</p><p><i>Oliver</i>: Yes. So whenever we can find maybe a set of predictions or something like that, where we completely expect different groups of people to give different quality of answers. That would help us maybe tease out some of the&nbsp;things.</p><p><i>Gregory</i>: Yeah.</p><p><i>Oliver</i>: So I wonder if we could find the edge of like where I expect super forecasters to stop being good. Where just like you expect super forecasters to stop being good, where maybe it works, where like I can imagine that there is a world where you\u2026 Like let's say we go into the domain of quantum physics or something like that, and where I think I still need to reflect a bit more about it, but naively would expect that, I think like my trust in super forecasters would extend further into domain of like narrow quantum physics, and getting questions such as like, \"Is cold fusion possible?\" Something you talked about it in one of your blog posts, and we ask physicists, maybe even a pretty good physicist from a top university, and we ask a super forecaster, and who would we trust on that? And I think I would be pretty torn. I really do. I think I would have a good chance, especially if I have a super forecaster work on it for a week, I would have a pretty good chance that I would trust them more than the average physicists. At least PhD&nbsp;students.</p><p><i>Gregory</i>: I definitely agree with the direction of where we differ. I'm just not quite sure if we'd like can crispy like, find out exactly where, because not necessarily, if you have a fairly wacky thing like cold fusion, physicists wouldn't necessarily usually work on cold fusion. Or have any knowledge of it, like they'd just think it seems weird to me. It's effectively outside my\u2026 I agree in the general sense that obviously, you'd want several key core skills, like having good accuracy of beliefs. You would expect these things to apply more broadly than I would. If you're trying to predict whether the answer is like Ramsey 55, or Ramsey 77, I would be much more willing to trust my intuitions about super forecasters to give more evidence for that, or similar things like&nbsp;that.</p><p>It would generally be nice, I guess\u2026 One interesting area perhaps is like, data on rationality training, like calibration training. There's not really crisp evidence of improving like job performance is my understanding. I'm not very acquainted with this literature, but my standard understanding is, we do this stuff. They learn these cognitive biases, and yet you haven't gotten better. Now it could be a skill like this doesn't transfer. If you just drill it you might become smarter, but it could be something like, it's not really training the underlying skill. But if it was improving the underlying skill and yet you don't see improvement in performance where we think expertise would matter, we would give different predictions about how likely that is to be the case. But again this might be a little bit too woolly to really pin&nbsp;down.</p><p><i>Oliver</i>: I actually think this is a very important domain, and I think one of the things that kind of underlines a lot of my edifice of opinion here is, there is this interesting question, where at some point in the 17th century, humanity started being able to solve problems that it was never be able to solve before, remotely. Like we started out like being able to kind of, if we really tried, build a simple city, and then 200 years later or 300 years later we build rockets that flew to the moon. We built computers, we built the Internet, and it really seems like something\u2026 like, we see something like the Flynn effect. You can imagine maybe something like general competence increased and people got more intelligent. People had less like nutritional deficiencies and maybe that's the reason why we can do all of those&nbsp;things.</p><p>But I think the case for that is not strong enough. I think ultimately there is a strong argument for something like, there was a quantification and mathematification of a lot of these fields of science, that allows us to build the methods of science, build out physics as a domain, and then start just solving lots and lots of problems with this pretty small set of tools. And like, if you look at all of human knowledge at the time, this at the time, if you look at the 17th century, like what you would study at university, it was primarily rhetoric. It was primarily like lots and lots of theology. And then you would maybe spend something like 10% of your time studying mathematics, maybe 15% of your time studying mathematics. But that branch turned out, that kind of relatively small aspect of human knowledge, turned out to be very widely applicable, and to solve a really large domain of problem. And I think this highlights an important sentence in which we have, I think we have an answer to discretion of whether there are domain general skills that allow you to get better at solving problems in a large range. And I think the answer is, a lot of like modern quantified science and the evidence we have for that is the scientific and industrial revolution. And I wonder if&nbsp;like\u2026</p><p><i>Gregory</i>: I think there's part of the point I agree with, but I'm not sure how much of the variance it explains in the classical challenge, here. I mean like inferring, I mean like, there's a perennial problem in the field of like, macro-historical judgment is very hard. Too early to tell what caused the scientific revolution. It might be too early to say we're confident with the scientific revolution was because we discovered a maths, when there was like lots of precursors. Now we discovered calculus reasoning just before, and I think it's quite hard to work out things like intellectual traditions. But I agree in the general sense. We have like sort of really crisp historical data showing we made this like advance in thinking tools, and this great wealth of understanding opened up in front of&nbsp;us.</p><p>I think that's all very favorable evidence. It's like been, to a very large degree, these very key skills you can apply to lots of stuff, rather than my view where it's like, you have like lots of like hedgehogs. Hedgehogs or foxes? I think hedgehogs. You have to burrow you way into your area to like, get good answers. I'm just wondering. We might be thinking of moving to point B? You get the last word in,&nbsp;but\u2026</p><p><i>Oliver</i>: No, I think that's pretty natural stopping point here. Okay, cool. So next thing that we wanted to cover is when are you an expert, and it covers a lot of very similar ground. I wonder whether you have like some initial&nbsp;thoughts.</p><p><i>Gregory</i>: Yes. I think like where we can go next is we can, we can discuss often, in the general sense, like how the different classes of cognizers are like, and how much there's like a single axis of thinking skills. Like with people who were top, who are able to get lots of things, or if it's like very, very dimensional. Like, if you're an expert at math, you can make good predictions at math. If you're an expert in politics, you can make good predictions in politics. I know there's lots of different things and therefore if you're like, but then what do you do, and if you're a typical person who is not an expert in many things, or in my case an expert in anything, what you can do instead is say, if I'm like pretty mediocre at everything, I can steal the knowledge out people have got, and steal their predictions and use that instead. And that just seems like a strategy-stealing, superior approach. And then I guess I'd then say even if we\u2026 even if we disagree or how much there's like, one key skill, I'll say you can often maybe like surpass what's a typical individual in this community can do, if we defer more, rather than saying I've read, I've looked into stuff and rationality, I've read various works on like how to by rational. I see myself equipped and have very confident pronouncements to make, on let's say macro economic theory or public health and stuff like that. And that's the typical principle of mediocrity rather than modestly. The typical person, even in EA, who are very clever people, of course you all are, generally would always almost always do better if they're deferring to someone. Whether that's a super forecaster or a domain expert is unclear. But I do think we are unexceptional cognizers in this whole sense, or at least not so exceptional. We can always bank on ourselves to want to stake out our own views constantly, but maybe that's not quite getting to the crux of the matter, as you might&nbsp;say.</p><p><i>Oliver</i>: So I think this is\u2026 I feel like this is almost responding to your previous point and I kind of wanted pull on this, but it's kind of something that's been\u2026 where I have this thing. I have this feeling that we both agree that the question of who is an expert and how should we aggregate opinion, and something like when exactly should we believe someone else's opinion and how should we integrate with us? Like if we both agree this is a very rich and important domain, in a sense that it's important that we figure out the general rules of this space, we figure out how to aggregate knowledge like that. But I feel\u2026 I don't know what it is, but I have sometimes the feeling that when you advocate for modesty, that you advocate not for the study of a rich&nbsp;field.</p><p>I feel you're not advocating necessarily being like, something that\u2026 I think the thing that I would be definitely deeply behind is something like: I think the question of how to aggregate opinion of the people around you is important, and the answer is not obvious. Like the answer is, here are some interesting considerations that we have. And then you would like maybe need examples, and then somebody would want to start getting expertise in this domain, meta-expertise. That would be, let's look at the example of super forecasters with physicists, analyze the structure of that, and then come to some conclusions, and then maybe try to extract some general principles from that. And then I would be like, yep, those are good principles. But like kind of making it clear that there is an art and a skill here that needs to be built up over time, where I'm worried that when you usually say modesty, you're like just, be less arrogant or something like&nbsp;that.</p><p>And I agree that maybe some people have like an aura of arrogance, but it's like a very\u2026 something like trying to tell a physicist that they're not making a lot of progress, because they always write too large in their notebook, and so they run out of space before they finished thinking on a current notebook page. And I'm like, I guess I can see how this is maybe an error that someone is making, but it really doesn't seem like the most important dimension, or something like that. Like arrogance or something feels almost like, it's a relevant variable, that I think is important to calibrate, but it doesn't strike me as one of the key variables. And I wonder whether you might disagree with&nbsp;that.</p><p><i>Gregory</i>: I didn't know. It may be a little bit hard to litigate the examples I have in mind, which may not be very helpful to discuss. I think my view is, if maybe the case that it's not necessarily straightforward, that doing like the modesty thing well is in itself a bit of a skill. But I think it is also the case that maybe I can't identify really clear mistakes. So there's the case I got from a friend where someone said by way I've disproved the continuum hypothesis: I've god this notebook, would you like to have a look, and it just feels like in that sort of world, we answer, no, I can just tell you with probability 1 minus epsilon you're wrong about this, and you should have thought the same because there's lots of proofs of this, and the rest of&nbsp;it.</p><p><i>Oliver</i>: Yes.</p><p><i>Gregory</i>: So I see like I definitely feel like there's like steps you make to do better. I often see like sort of like really obvious mistakes, and then the simple word, is please stop being so epistemically arrogant. But let me say what you do instead is a bit more involved. But as a crude rule of thumb, I often find this seems to do better is I guess my view. But also the other thing whereby like epistemic immodesty, and immodesty in general are not exactly the same thing, and they can co-locate. You might get annoyed or people being like a bit cocky. So for me, I'm like cocky all the time, and I'm like preaching epistemic modesty, so these things do come apart in various respects. But in the same way, it's important to stress that one shouldn't poison one's epistemics by personal dislike you have for a certain communication style, or anything like that. I may not always practice what I preach here, but I do at least recognize I may be at&nbsp;fault.</p><p><i>Oliver</i>: Yeah. I do think this is something that I probably expect to be useful to clarify. Like we both agree and we kind of had an earlier conversation a bit about this, where there's just this really important distinction between what we think of as social expertise, where there's like, I guess the degree to which our gut judgment says that somebody is an expert, and something like the actual epistemic expertise. The actual track record of how much will they reliably get questions in this domain right. And just that those are definitely two different things, in different domains, that can get completely different&nbsp;answers.</p><p><i>Gregory</i>: What made how completely might be&nbsp;another\u2026</p><p><i>Oliver</i>: Yes, that might be&nbsp;the-</p><p><i>Gregory</i>: I might be more deferential. It's like sort of cultural expertise. Like okay, if I've got an expertise it's good. If you're an expert in this area, even if you're not a super forecaster, you might still be worth deferring to in many cases. Probably like obviously that disagreement over how well we can correlate may not be a large part of a wider discussion I&nbsp;guess.</p><p><i>Oliver</i>: Yes. So I do think that\u2026 I think the example that you mentioned, somebody thinks they just proved the continuum hypothesis, is very good, because also contrast like naturally with somebody comes in and says\u2026 I don't know, let's go back to like, when was it, 2012? Of like Iraq has nuclear weapons or something like that, or chemical weapons. Where there was this\u2026 there was a situation where we had experts in the field, who was the CIA at the time, who made predictions, and now somebody comes and is like, you know, actually, I Googled myself for a while for the relevant evidence, and I think it's pretty obvious that they don't. And then we, I think in that case I wouldn't go say probability one minus epsilon at all that they are wrong. I would probably say, if I don't know them very well, like 30% that they're right at maximum, maybe 20% that they are&nbsp;right.</p><p>But I would have a very different attitude towards that kind of thing. And I'm very worried that if we try to paint this very broad brush of modesty, that we'll put those in the same bucket as the continuum hypothesis and mathematics, which we know has\u2026 is in a framework, with several proofs. And is in a framework in which we can expect to be rigorous, and I think it's very important. Like is it a framework that we've seen work? Or something like that. Where like, I do think mathematics is really important. We have seen mathematics work over and over again, and so there's a sense in which when somebody disproves a major mathematical theorem that we expect to be true, or like at least that many, many people have thought about a lot, then we can trust that their effort was something productive. Whereas if we're talking about international politics and situations where I have never heard of a large class of experts who reliably got those questions right. And so in those situations I don't think we should apply the same standard of&nbsp;modesty.</p><p><i>Gregory</i>: So I think you'll obviously fair to say that picking mathematics is the easiest example of my case. We actually know the ground truth. I think I would say though, but well, I would go on to say something like this. So suppose you're this person who Googles for maybe like two hours, whether Iraq has chemical weapons, whatever it was, and you decide like probably not. It seems to be the approach a typical person would take. It's like if you're like a third party to this conversation, like somebody walks up to you and says oh, I've done some Googling. Actually Iraq doesn't have chemical weapons after&nbsp;all.</p><p>That evidence to you should be like aggregated with basically zero weight. Because there's lots\u2026 like thousands of thousands of people, with all of their views saying it has or it hasn't. Experts have spent loads and loads of time on it. And now it may be the case they are right. Because it's very hard to tell as you say, there's no really good, robust demonstration of evidence. But the mere fact that someone's telling you \"I've Googled this for a while\" or similarly cursory efforts, shouldn't really massively update you one way or the other, I would allege. And then you can sort of anticipate my next idea, which is well if that's true, then by indifference, you shouldn't care whether you are that person or you're hearing it from a third party. Because if you're a person who spent two hours Googling it or whatever, then you also shouldn't be updating any more than if someone else was doing, who's similarly situated to you. And that, I would argue, would always lead to considerable deference in most&nbsp;cases.</p><p><i>Oliver</i>: I think that really depends because, usually, let's say I followed\u2026 at the time I don't think I was doing this. But let's imagine we, in the present day, we have the same Iraq nuclear weapons question. And I've been casually following the news and the answer is like, okay, I've heard. I've definitely heard the fact that there are people who have opinions on both sides. But I wasn't given any evidence about the methods of the people on either side. Like I wasn't given access to the methods that they used to arrive at their opinion, but now a friend of mine comes over and says, I said no. Now I agree that if we just count the number of people who have opinions in here, this might be, he might just be a very small drop in the bucket, but if we assume that people with the better methods reliably get better answers, and I have some expectation that my friend has better methods than the average person, which I think I can expect in the domain of policy forecasters, then this is actually a major&nbsp;update.</p><p>Because now it is the first time that I heard evidence, with the methods that were being used. And I think a really dangerous\u2026 like a really important dimension of all of this, is that in scientific fields it is very often extremely hard to figure out what methods people actually use to come to their opinions. If I read a physics journal that describes an experiment, I only really see the experiment that they ran, and maybe some mathematical analyses they did, but I didn't get any insight into the thinking. I didn't get any insight into how did they go about hypothesis generation? How did they go about\u2026 how many alternative hypotheses did they consider and weigh? And for my friends and for the people who are very close to me, I have that evidence much more often because I know their methods and processes. And so I actually think updating on that to a large degree can very often be the correct&nbsp;choice.</p><p><i>Gregory</i>: Ah, right. So we do definitely disagree on that. So I think where I go is, I think I would suggest/allege/whatever, that it seems you have a very parochial view of the typical epistemic qualities of the people around you. So I agree. Like if someone, like if your friend like comes up to you, somebody who you respect, and they give you their reasoning as to why we should think Iraq doesn't have chemical weapons and you go, \"I know this person is telling me what they think, and they're definitely very reasonable.\" But you go, \"look man, there's professors of international relations.\" Now you might go like, \"okay but they may not necessarily be super forecasters.\" No, granted, but you can probably anticipate if you manage to get to talk to one of these people, they're like, you would hope, I'd suggest you should expect, if you chatted with someone who'd worked in security studies in the Middle East, they'd give you a reasoned judgment as to why we think it's more or less likely that Iraq has chemical weapons or&nbsp;not.</p><p>And so it may be the case that you think\u2026 if you think like the relevant, like meta-epistemic qualities are very rare to find, such that your friend who has them, you'd put them above some relevant domain experts, we have like implicit knowledge of what they think. You retire what you see the US government saying, you retire what you see academics are saying. You retire all these talking heads, or, well maybe they aren't experts, but other people who are experts on the news saying things, and so on and so forth. I'll say that you shouldn't necessarily go, \"but because I, I've seen with my own eyes what they're thinking\" in the case of your friend, you should weigh that more heavily. Maybe you can't have access to the generating methods, but you should like offer like some, you should be willing to trust these people. They do actually have some there if you are able to investigate, because that's where I would like want to go I&nbsp;guess.</p><p><i>Oliver</i>: But I do think that like the big assumption that was here was that an average chosen professor of foreign studies at maybe a major university, will they have methods that are at all reasonable to come to good conclusions? And I think the answer is like, no, in the sense that I think the average professor of foreign relations at a major university does not have something like the calculus of reason to actually make correct probabilistic statements about that kind of stuff. Like, it doesn't matter. Even if you're exposed to a lot of the data, if you don't have a sense\u2026 if you don't reliably can keep apart causation from correlation, if you don't reliably keep apart like the social biases that you have and the status hierarchies and the environment from your epistemic beliefs, it doesn't\u2026 I don't think it really matters how much precisely you know about the specific foreign relations of the country you're talking about, because that evidence won't be like\u2026 those ideas won't be able to build on one another. You're not actually given me a reasonable opinion that I can trust. And I think, like, I want to go back to kind of the mathematical reasoning, because I think there's a strong analogy here of, you can imagine you have, there is this question, let's say we&nbsp;have\u2026</p><p>I think, let's go into the domain of construction, where only in the 18th or 19th century did we really start to have any form of a systematic method of building things. Like we did some simple static analysis before that, but mostly when we built things, we stacked things on top of each other, saw whether they fell down, noted which things didn't fall down, and then built those things again, and maybe combined them in smaller ways. And so we had these people who definitely were exposed a lot to the domain of building things. They architected many buildings with this method, and now we have modern physicists encountering them. And they have access to the modern calculus of physics and understand modern statics. And now let's say they've only participated in building a single&nbsp;building.</p><p>They've only seen a single thing constructed, but they've kind of seen all the basic parts of how it is to construct a building. What I'm arguing for is that they will be able to integrate that evidence much, much better, because they will have the language to describe those kind of things. They will be able to describe statics, they will be able to generalize, when they see an upstanding arc, why that arc stands up and how much weight it will have, and that ultimately the next building is the one that I would trust a physicist much, much more than a person who just built a&nbsp;building.</p><p><i>Gregory</i>: So I think it's interesting because I think where we differ is maybe like at a baseline level or at a baseline difference between two groups. So I'm definitely not going to defend the claim, that like a typical professor of foreign policy has got really good like epistemic norms, more than a typical person, because we have lots and lots and lots of data on heuristics and biases that apply to everyone, no matter how allegedly degreed or prestigious they are. I guess where I differ is I'm not sure, although you keep excellent company, whether a particular friend of yours is in expectation going to be much better than domain experts in this area, such that you go, \"even though this person doesn't have the same level of expertise as this person, we have a pro tanto reason to trust them slightly more at least.\" Because they have the other metacognitive skills, I should count them much higher than the prevailing view of an expert class, because they are much higher than the average level of like epistemic quality in this area. I guess is like the&nbsp;thing.</p><p>If that could be made concrete whereas you'd test people, and see how good they are at predictions, if it turns out for example, that bay area community is chock full of super forecasters, then yes I'd that's obviously like a really good reason to take their views much more seriously than for example, what you typically see expert groups doing. I guess where I sort of differ is, although I think we're great, I'm not sure we're that great, in this sort of&nbsp;way.</p><p><i>Oliver</i>: I think I'm, I'm not arguing that precisely the people I'm surrounding myself.,, I think I hope that the people have chosen as my friends are good at thinking; I think that is one of the primary things I select them for. But, I don't want to make the argument that that is the thing that ultimately, it's not the fact that they're my friends that's the primary selection criteria here, but I'm saying something like, it is, there are many, many people who are not my friends who if they give me advice, if they make a judgment in a certain case, then I will trust him much more than my friends. I'm not making the argument that my friends&nbsp;are\u2026</p><p><i>Gregory</i>: Maybe like we can get more crisp idea. So I agree it doesn't really matter whether you like these people or they're friends of yours, but I guess like I don't see what you might think of as like\u2026 If you're going to treat certain individuals like, sort of epistemically\u2026 \"oracle\" is more dismissive than I mean, but sort of like people with very good judgment applied across multiple domains, so you would actually have good reason to trust them over what prevailing experts seem to say, then it seems like you can test, we can just look at their like track record and say, \"look, we just keep getting stuff right, again and again and again, in all these different&nbsp;areas.\"</p><p>But I guess I don't usually see this evidence, or at least there is no public version of this evidence, for when I see this often done widely, and it may be the case for you do have this pro-evidence, which is great. I wonder, out of interest, how carefully you try to investigate the track record of people you take to trust so highly. I also wonder in the typical use case of people doing this stuff, how often they are doing it as well. Because maybe, you epistemic virtuous par excelsis, are already good at this. But a typical person might massively overweight what their peer group perhaps thinks. That that makes sense if someone they quite like happens to say and so on and so forth. So maybe even if the angels can do what you're doing, maybe the great unwashed like myself should be quietly deferring&nbsp;away.</p><p><i>Oliver</i>: So, I think the evidence that we have that certain forms of reasoning vastly outperform other forms of reasoning is not evidence that is very hard to access. I don't think like the fact that these gradients exist, and seeing the rough structure of it, and seeing that it's a very lopsided, kind of very heavy tailed domain where we see certain forms of reasoning massively outperforming other forms of reasoning, I think it's something that is fairly accessible just looking at the trajectory of history. I agree that historical judgments are hard to make, but I do think that across the board we've seen a few specific forms of reasoning just show up as successful again and again. So I don't think that it's about like the degree to which I have like a special ability to judge other people's judgment in some major&nbsp;like\u2026</p><p><i>Gregory</i>: I'm not saying you have special access rather than like, do you in fact see these people out there? Is it the case that you can find them. There's a few super forecasters, not many super forecasters,&nbsp;and\u2026</p><p><i>Oliver</i>: The thing that I'm saying is that the natural variation does exist out there, and it has existed over human history, and already makes a massive difference. I'm seeing that whether you\u2026 when trying to answer a question, make simple quantitative estimates or not is something we see massive amounts of variation in the population. Just like it probably is about like something like 5% to 15% of the population that I think very frequently if they try to answer a question, we'll go and make a simple quantitative estimate of the problem, and there's about 85% of the population who expect will not do this. This is a variation that we normally see. It's nothing special, it's not an extremely high bar of epistemic excellence. So it's just like a pretty standard skill that some people have and some people don't. And I think we see reliably the degree to which we make these short, small quantitative estimates tends to be highly predictive of the ability to make reasonable judgments in almost all domains. And as such, I felt that the thing you were just saying is that there aren't that many people who really live up to this high bar of excellence. And I'm saying no, I think even small gradient degrees to which you are slightly better at reasoning make a massive difference in your ability to predict the future. And those was a small enough that we see natural variation in different scientific fields, in different people, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p><i>Gregory</i>: Yes, okay. So I guess like perhaps where I would go is, I would want to like say something like this. So it may be the case, per like the previous topic, like the main variance in like how good your predictions are is like how good you are at these other skills you've been highlighting, like making Fermi estimates, or like metacognitive skills are a really big factor. But compared to that, often domain expertise like has like a bit of a boost, especially initially, that rapidly diminishes. So it's often the case you must put your faith in epistemic qualities over mere domain expertise. But then there's also the question of how the distribution of epistemic qualities goes. I definitely agree, you do like a little bit better by doing Fermi estimates, and things like that. I guess I'll say is that often we take the expert class of people who work in academia, for example, like implicitly higher IQ, and we know IQ correlates rationality skills as&nbsp;well.</p><p>And so it seems to me that even if we can find people who are somewhat better, who are really good at these sorts of skills, I think the typical academic is somewhat better, if not really, really good at these sort of metacognitive skills. There's a lot of room at the top for which they could reach. Now I want to say that maybe the room at the top, there's not many people in this like far tail of this distribution. And so then, I want to make feet this observation I made before about, how many of these people do we have? And so on, and so&nbsp;forth.</p><p><i>Oliver</i>: Yes. My model predicts something like, the effect of this continues to be pretty large, like all throughout the board, up until, if I have a single research organization, or if I have an academic field that has these skills generally much more widely distributed, even identifying the individual people\u2026 at every given step, I think it's highly valuable to identify people who have those epistemic skills, and not. And I'm worried that this gives rise to something like\u2026 I wouldn't necessarily say that we disagree on data mentioned that much, on like if somebody would put a gun to her head and like what would we say in the moment, what the correct answer is, but something like the degree to which we expect additional evidence about people's expertise to continue updating our opinions in this space. Where I think like my model is something like if you give me a rough guess of, let's say we go back does Iraq have nuclear weapons question, and you tell me most university professors with foreign studies, or let's say like 70% of them think this is&nbsp;correct.</p><p>And like, okay, I guess I'm going to make it like an update on that because that seems\u2026 let's say they think they don't have weapons. Okay, I'm going to make an update on that. I don't know. I feel that I would drastically change my mind if I would now hear that a specific university that I think has like larger track record, let's say something like, I don't know, I don't have much meta-domain expertise of like, foreign relations. But if I would see someone who I think has demonstrated good judgment here, maybe this would come up as a question in the good judgement project, I would expect that this would drastically change my opinion again, where I would expect that it would change this quite a bit. And as such I suspect that there's this common phenomenon that I see with people taking the modest approach, where they kind of saying, just trust the average of the&nbsp;experts.</p><p>And then I'm like no, look, there's this sense of confidence that comes with that, where you're like, ah, the average of the experts is as best as we can do. And like, no. The average of the experts is definitely not the best that we can do. The average of finding out the epistemic practices of every single person in the field and precisely understanding them, and also understanding the subject domain is the best we can do, and both of those are really interesting directions to go, and there's much more work to be done. You can't just stand here and say that the problem is like as much as we can possibly solve, solved just because kind of you have made a rough expert&nbsp;survey.</p><p><i>Gregory</i>: Maybe we should move on the next&nbsp;topic.</p><p><i>Oliver</i>: Yes.</p><p><i>Gregory</i>: We have 15 minutes. But I'm going to briefly defend myself from your slander. So it's definitely the case that it's not going to be that all experts are created equal, even through common sense with the epistemics that had been previously cashed out in mind. And I agree as you say, you can do much, much better than the average of the experts, but the average method may do much, much better for your first order impressions of view. And now it may be the case amongst like very sophisticated cognizers, they end up sort of getting stuck in the middle of being a little bit too modest, a little bit too stuck. But I think definitely in the general world, even I think in the EA community, you see much more, I have this impression, I read this a little while, I'm pretty certain this is the right answer. And they don't really consult the experts, and sort of ask what the experts think, and all the rest of it. And I always want to say, there's much further you could do in terms of aggregate agreement and things like&nbsp;that.</p><p>But I think that asking the experts the last thing you want to do. But probably I think often it's a step forward among prevailing\u2026 as a fundamental thing, in terms of weighing the variance, it's like you can imagine sort of back tracing prediction markets and betting markets, and see how big an impact is like updating different releasing information to have to update it. And then if we buy that, that there's a stronger sense of how elitist we should be in terms of weighing different sorts of expertise, is a hard question. We mentioned earlier this idea of like gun to your head versus second order. So maybe I'll let you take it away, with respect to&nbsp;that.</p><p><i>Oliver</i>: I think think one of the things that influences my perspective on all of this the most, it's kind of\u2026 I think we've been so far answering the question of okay, let's see. You have to give an answer to what the likelihood of Iraq having the weapons is, in the next five minutes. That's it. Now you need to make a decision. For some reason somebody is putting a gun to your head and you need to give the answer. Usually you're not in that environment. I think usually you're in an environment, hopefully, where you are trying to explore, you're trying to understand the topic, and I think there's the question of what attitude should we have towards the topic while we're trying to understand the relevant subject matter? And I think a classical example that I would give here is let's say you're a mathematics undergraduate, and you are trying to understand the basic theorems of mathematics. Let's say you're in linear algebra. Let's say you're in real analysis or something like that, and you can easily imagine a world where you hear like there's Zorn's lemma, or like kind of like one of the most highly confusing axioms of real analysis. You go okay, I guess lots of people find this reasonable. So I guess that's what I should believe. And then you continue doing your proofs in mathematics and you dutifully write your proofs on. But I don't think like this will actually produce a great mathematician. I think the great mathematician will be produced who will react to that being like, what? Why would you be able to have an infinite chain of things that bottoms out at some maximum, and be able to always be sure that it has this weird attribute? That doesn't make any sense! Like I can imagine here that's also equivalent to this other&nbsp;thing!</p><p>Like there's a sense in which I expect emotional engagement with the topic, to heavily depend the degree to which they learn, and that I think can very easily be mistaken for something like immodesty, where like when I studied mathematics I will have emotions about it. So like, there's no way this is true, this is obviously false, and it has nothing to do with my degree of\u2026 I mean it's something like\u2026 maybe a part of me has that credence, but it is an additive to have while learning, and I'm definitely worried that\u2026 I really enjoy this aspect of scientific fields, of physicists and mathematicians, and also many people in this community are people being able to have these engaged conversations. Of feeling like they're really interacting with their models, and I'm worried that you are mistaking that for something like immodesty. Or maybe we disagree, maybe disagree that it's a good&nbsp;idea.</p><p><i>Gregory</i>: No, I think in this case it's a good idea. I mean, we may disagree on how we interpret it. It's obviously the case that you could be like an epistemic free ride with modesty, so you spend all your time trying to weigh up for the expert classes and never form object-level beliefs. You're just like, I'm really good like calibrating expertise now, I do that all day long, and I have like no object level views on anything beyond what I can do. Right? And that might be a really useful skill for the wider community. It could be like a really useful thing to do. Like maybe what a super super forecaster could be like, like a valuable trait for the community, on which much more later, but it's obviously the case that if you want to become a mathematician, that's like not the right approach. Your job is to actually do object level work, like object level progress, and that requires like actually engaging with the object level matters of things, like full impressions about things, make arguments about various bits and pieces, and I think you can do this&nbsp;with\u2026</p><p>You can marry this with modesty or, marry this modestly to modesty, in the sense that you could like, go well, in my own personal view, I do philosophy occasionally in my spare time. I'll have a little bit of a look at this topic. I'm probably not going to make anything groundbreaking to argue in favor of this particular view, and then hopefully come up with something interesting. Even if like you put a gun, what's the most plausible view on this topic? I may end up like just deferring\u2026 well, philosophy is hard to defer to. But, the pervading view. Maybe a better example, is like Scott Sumner, who's like a master economist, talks about a two level view of approaches. Well, from my own personal perspective, I just spend all my time doing stuff like doing object level work, like hopefully proving my theory is right, but if you put a gun to my head I would actually do the overall thing, and then like if there's lots of like sort of like back and forth, like testing out models, then I'm pretty cool with&nbsp;that.</p><p>I guess I get the impression, like usually people, if you put a gun to their head, they'll say basically the same thing as they were saying just now. And it's like less of like the whole, less of a two-level approach, which I see. If they were doing lots of that, I'm really happy. Or like reasonably happy, I'm pretty curmudgeonly anyway, but like more happy than I usually am. I guess I just don't see as much as I'd like to see naturally. I sort of get this impression with us, we're overconfidently holding first impressions, and there's like benefits like doing this normal thing, but I almost feel, not for you guys, but some people I've talked to other, use it as like an excuse, like, well I'm just like trying to be really cocky here, but excuse&nbsp;this.</p><p><i>Oliver</i>: Yes. I think there's like one, one perspective where I expect we both, at least my model of our two models, we'll both agree that one of the things that is most valuable here, that I think is definitely correct, which is that like this habit and pattern of people actually betting their beliefs, and then having bets with one another that are evaluated one way or another, and putting probabilities on that, and having those bets proportional to those probabilities, is like a norm that I'm very excited about. And like, would love to see spread much more. I'm really excited about people doing more like, prediction market-like things, especially because I think it actually gives you the evidence of whether we see people being overconfident. I think we could have the conversation about when we look at the track record of the people. I think this is like a conversation probably for another&nbsp;day.</p><h1>Q&amp;A</h1><p><i>Question</i>: How do we navigate expert advice coming from domains plagued by sub-optimal incentive structures such as medicine or academia? And similarly, does the instinct to trust friends whose model you have access to over experts make more sense when considering that some of these experts may have perverse incentives that lead them to promote certain&nbsp;beliefs?</p><p><i>Gregory</i>: So the answer is, like, doing it is really hard. I'm not saying it's easy to discount heavily by like who has skin in the game. Who has biases, and things like that. I guess like I have like a very long discussion of this sort of thing. I feel like I can rehearse what I typically say so it's like\u2026 so okay. So you think someone's like, you think expert classes\u2026 so economists may be biased, or medics are often biased about various things for a variety of reasons. But a question like, hey, is this bias like selectively toxic, like versus you or versus your friend, because politics gets in the way. Why are your friends less likely to be biased, from the outside view even you would be. And that's like okay, fine. So maybe it does count against them but it seems like, unless they're really riven by biases, maybe on balance they're more likely to be&nbsp;right.</p><p>Because it's easy if you're like, a pharma company doing something, it's easier to get your drug to market if it actually works than if it doesn't. You can still do it, but at least it's harder. So it's solvent in that sort of way. So I guess I want to often say that, yeah, I know, I'm not sure either sometimes. But I guess my view would be in many cases, that you can undercut expertise with claims of bias, but I think often this selective undercutting effect versus you or versus your friends, is not so large as to outweigh the other stuff. Like oh, maybe I should study this for 20 years. Like maybe that does count for something in many cases. So I'll say that often like, wins the day. It doesn't always, but it often&nbsp;does.</p><p>And if you thing like the expert class should be got rid of, maybe should just defer to other people. So sort of like, people who read really widely in this topic on the Internet, or some other group who might not have this bias but also might have thought about it much longer than you&nbsp;have.</p><p><i>Oliver</i>: My perspective on that is qualitatively, I probably agree. Quantitatively I kind of go much further in the direction of like, the bias of relevant expert fields. I expect, okay actually I think I want to give a slightly different answer. A different answer is something like, there is a very dangerous framing in thinking of expert fields as being biased. I think there's like a general problem that we have. This like this is named for the modern fallacies and biases field, that alternatively it's the field of modern cognitive heuristics. And there's two framings of the same field, that I think highlight very importantly different perspectives. Where, when you think of fallacies and biases, you think of how are they deviating from a rational actor who is perfectly epistemic and doing everything right, and you're like, what is that really like? I don't know how to implement it on a human&nbsp;mind.</p><p>But in a cognitive heuristic domain, I'm asking myself what procedures are they actually executing to get to the answer and, now you're not, you're not trying to answer the question of deviation, which I think is really hard, but instead of just trying to answer the question of, well, what kind of questions do we expect that set of heuristics to reliably answer correctly, which ones will it reliably answer badly, and just trying to build a model of how they actually come to their opinions. And kind of similarly to how I much prefer the framing of cognitive heuristics over the framing of cognitive fallacies and vices, do I also much prefer the framing of building models where experts come to their opinions, as opposed to asking ourselves the question of how experts are biased. I think trying to answer the question of how experts are biased without first having built a model of how precisely they will come to their opinions, is the doomed endeavor, and instead I would usually try to answer the question of, well, let's just ask ourselves the question of what questions are they incentivized to answer? What things like, what do they output given those incentives? And then ask ourselves whether that is the kind of process that we would trust in outputting the correct answer. And have a very different&nbsp;framing.</p>", "user": {"username": "The Centre for Effective Altruism"}}, {"_id": "xsQN9KCbrLZpNr45f", "title": "Ozy Brennan, Kieran Greig, and Abraham Rowe: Building support for wild animal suffering", "postedAt": "2018-06-08T07:15:00.000Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBMy7NnSOPc&amp;list=PLwp9xeoX5p8P3cDQwlyN7qsFhC9Ms4L5W&amp;index=26\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lBMy7NnSOPc\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><hr><p><i>There are a tremendous number of animals in the wild, and many of them suffer horribly. But it\u2019s not easy to figure out how to make things better for wild animals, or when we should. To figure out how best to help wild animals, we\u2019ll need a lot more people involved. So how do we reach those people? In this panel discussion from Effective Altruism Global 2018: San Francisco, Ozy Brennan, Kieran Greig, and Abraham Rowe offer their answers to this question, and Persis Eskander moderates.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>A transcript of the panel's discussion is below, which we have lightly edited for&nbsp;clarity. You can also watch it on </i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBMy7NnSOPc&amp;list=PLwp9xeoX5p8P3cDQwlyN7qsFhC9Ms4L5W&amp;index=26\"><i>YouTube</i></a><i> and read it on </i><a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/ea-global-2018-building-support-for-wild-animal-suffering/\"><i>effectivealtruism.org</i></a><i>.</i></p><h1>The Talk</h1><p><i>Persis:</i> Today, the goal for this whiteboard session is to better understand what are some successful communication techniques or strategies that we could be applying depending on different target audiences that are relevant for wild animal suffering. So, it's going to be broken down into four categories. The first is basic messaging. The second is communicating wild animal suffering to domain experts. So, for example, people in academia. The third is communicating wild animal suffering to people who are interested in animal rights and animal welfare but who are not quite convinced that we should be focusing on this over more traditional issues. And the last one is on the best way to talk about&nbsp;interventions.</p><p><i>Persis</i>: So I'm going to start with asking each of the panelists to give us an example of basic messaging that's been really successful and ways that they've been able to communicate with someone who's totally unfamiliar with wild animal suffering. And also, feel free to point out areas in which things haven't quite worked out as well. So, we might start with Ozy and then go&nbsp;down.</p><p><i>Ozy</i>: Hi. So I think one of the things that is really important for me in communicating about wild animal suffering is that I very much try to be authentic and I try to say the things that I genuinely believe. I think that there's a real tendency for people to be like, \u201cOh no. We have to say things that are really calculated to appeal to everyone.\u201d And I don't think that that's a good way to grow a movement. I think that both ethically we should be honest about what our true thoughts are and in terms of getting people who are really value-aligned\u2026 it might be helpful in the short term, but in the long run, you need the people that you're going to get by actually saying what you&nbsp;believe.</p><p><i>Ozy</i>: Another thing that I found is helpful in basic messaging is thinking about the objections that people always have and sort of, don't wait for them to bring it up and being like, for example, I usually, when I'm talking to people about wild animal suffering, I mention\u2026 I bring up by myself that nobody is going to do anything, nobody is going to go out there and genetically engineer lions so that they only eat grass tomorrow, we're going to do lots of research before we do anything. We're going to start with smaller scale projects. There's a lot of uncertainty about ecology and we're totally aware of that and this is something that we're concerned about at Wild Animal Suffering Research and at other&nbsp;organizations.</p><p><i>Ozy</i>: And another thing that I tend to bring up is that, what I like to say is that right now, a lot of wildlife management has a dual purpose. It is managed for human benefit in terms of things like recreation, going out to nature, and also in terms of things like flood control. And it's also managed for conservation purposes. And so, my ideal thing would be to have it so that wildlife management is done with an eye towards human benefit and conservation and the welfare of the animals themselves. And so, I think that that ends up helping because it's not like I'm opposing humans and wild animals or conservation and wild animals but being like, all of these things are important. Let's try to figure out a way to do wildlife management so that we can do all of&nbsp;them.</p><p><i>Kieran</i>: Yeah. That was a very detailed and comprehensive answer. My answer is just quite basic. I usually say something along the lines of wild animals do matter and the conditions for wild animals don't seem great. I try and stay away from the more radical, fringe ideas of wild animals being crazily net negative, or the bulk of moral value is in insects. Yeah, this is basically my like, basic messaging&nbsp;approach.</p><p><i>Abraham</i>: Yeah, similarly, I think I like to focus on the scope of suffering in nature but also, really talk about the experiences of individuals. So, compare sort of the survival strategy of say, humans who spend a lot of time nurturing their young all the way until they can basically take care of themselves, to that of other animals where a lot of their young are going to die at a young age, probably painfully. I definitely avoid talking about speculative strategies to reduce wild animal suffering unless it\u2026 someone's really pushing what we can do. And when that does happen, I think it's\u2026 so Utility Farm has done a couple studies on what kind of messaging is most effective for talking about that, and pretty much describing the exact same strategy or intervention using different verbs will make a pretty radical difference in people's receptivity to that. So, using, talking about addressing wild animal suffering by stewarding nature or participating in a natural ecosystem as opposed to intervening in the lives of animals in the wild, just people are a lot more willing, it seems like to listen to what you have to say when you use language that they're used to and comfortable with like&nbsp;that.</p><p><i>Persis</i>: So, two takeaways that I've gotten from what the three of you have said is that, the first is trying to make it relatable and that means maybe, referring to issues that people are already in support of. And then, maybe drawing that further, taking the inferences further. And the second one is trying to find compromises between value systems. One question that I always feel people ask me whenever I talk about wild animal suffering to someone who's totally unfamiliar with it is, well, suffering in the wild is natural. I mean, that's pretty straightforward argument that a lot of people make. And so, we have this act omission bias. Do you have thoughts on ways that we can address&nbsp;that?</p><p><i>Kieran</i>: Yeah so, one thing that I would usually go there is that within humans, there's also a lot of natural suffering, and people are fine with eradicating diseases for humans. When we apply this reasoning to humans, it just that doesn't seem to stand up. So, I would point that out and then say if we kind of, follow that reasoning for wild animals, it just doesn't seem to hold up for&nbsp;me.</p><p><i>Ozy</i>: Yeah. I think that my point of view would be very much, well, malaria is natural. Like, 50% of all children dying before the age of five is natural. There's lots of horrible things that are natural. And I think that it is frankly speciesist to say we're going to try to get rid of natural things that are horrible for humans but if you're a wild animal, you're on your own,&nbsp;sorry.</p><p><i>Abraham</i>: Yeah, I feel like a lot of people who express things like this have a bit of misanthropic view towards nature. We don't like the idea of humans coming in and sort of, messing with nature. And I like to kind of play off that, and push on that and ask them, \u201cIf what you see in nature is sort of the beauty and awe and grandeur, if that's what's valuable in natural systems, is that not sort of, ascribing human values onto nature?\u201d And then, pushing on the question of well what's actually important about natural systems and I think a lot of people can come around to the idea that what really matters in nature is the lives of the beings who inhabit&nbsp;it.</p><p><i>Persis</i>: Great, let's move on to one that I'm particularly interested in, communicating wild animal suffering to domain experts. So one disagreement that I think I've had with a lot of people who are really invested in working in wild animal welfare is the extent to which we might need domain experts to be value aligned. So how important is it to improve our understanding of wild animal suffering, for domain experts to care about wild animal welfare and be motivated by a desire to improve the wellbeing of wild animals, as opposed to just being capable of doing empirical research that we then find valuable? So I'll start with&nbsp;Abraham.</p><p><i>Abraham</i>: Yeah, so I don't think domain experts are very aligned right now. In my experience a lot of people are really open to the idea that we should know more about the welfare of animals in the wild but they stop at the step of, we should do something to improve their welfare. And I think to some extent that's okay. I think there's definitely a lot of valuable research that can be done by biologists and ecologists just to learn more about the welfare of animals currently, but in the long run we're really going to need some kind of value alignment in order to, especially to just kind of assess how we can impact environments. So on the regulatory side there's already a huge treasure trove of data from the EPA and other similar agencies in other countries on how humans impact ecosystems when they build subdivisions, or do other sorts of projects like that. There's a very robust field and I think a lot of the work of translating that work into the language of welfare will require people who are really invested in doing these projects to improve the lives of wild&nbsp;animals.</p><p><i>Kieran</i>: Yeah so I think one critical distinction here is pioneers within the field versus those who then join the field after the field has been started. I think that for the pioneers who are initially in this field, that is probably going to be more tractable that they are value aligned. I think another critical distinction here is whether the research is on these nitty gritty empirical questions or whether the research is on prioritizing different questions. If it is on prioritizing different questions, I would say they very much need to be value aligned. If it is for things like nitty gritty questions, I think that they don't really need to be value aligned, I think they just need to have good research skills and research skills can be kind of orthogonal to this value&nbsp;alignment.</p><p><i>Ozy</i>: I think personally having researchers that care about wild animal suffering is very important. It's true there is a lot of information out there that's valuable for wild animal suffering that we collect for all sort of reasons. There's information about chronic stress in animals that people do because they're studying human depression and comparing it to wild animals. There's research about animals in zoos, there's research about epidemiology, there's tons of research about wildlife diseases that's intended to protect farmed animals. But the fact of the matter is that you're not going to get research on the most important issues of wild animal suffering if they're primarily being done either for human value or the value of domestic animals or because of scientific&nbsp;interest.</p><p>Another thing that I think is really important for domain experts, I don't think was talked about before is that domain experts have a lot of credibility with governments and I think that if we're going to have long-term change for wild animals, a lot of that is going to be done through governments because governments end up setting the policies about wildlife refuges and other places where lots of wildlife&nbsp;live.</p><p><i>Persis</i>: I have a follow up question. To what extent do you think it might be useful to work with academics who maybe aren't value aligned in the beginning and then see how far along the process you can move them? Or do you think perhaps values spreading within academia is a less effective route than starting directly with value aligned academics and having them grow the movement for&nbsp;us?</p><p><i>Abraham</i>: I don't think they're mutually exclusive, I think we should be doing both. The people who are published already, who bring legitimacy are going to be academics, so having them do some of the outreach within academia is very important. But I also think we can just by building broader public awareness of these issues, we can make them seem more normalized and make people more comfortable researching them in general, so both are&nbsp;important.</p><p><i>Kieran</i>: Yeah I think it's a really good question. I don't have strong views on it. One thing I would say is just pick up on what Abraham just said but I think it is important to have academics promoting these ideas to other academics. I think it's a lot harder to do the value spreading from kind of the non-profit sector into academia, it would be a lot better for an academic, for an ecologist or a biologist, whoever it is to take this on and to promote it to their&nbsp;peers.</p><p><i>Ozy</i>: Yeah, I feel like I don't really have a good sense right of what are the best ways to do spreading of anti animal suffering values to academia are. I think we should try a bunch of different things and see what&nbsp;works.</p><p><i>Persis</i>: So, I'd be interested in your experiences in how receptive domain experts have been and it would be great if you could give an example of a conversation that you've had, maybe one that was either\u2026 where the academic was very receptive or one where they were very unreceptive. And where you think the conversation went well or&nbsp;poorly.</p><p><i>Abraham</i>: Yeah I think I've a lot of incredibly productive conversations about the need for knowing more about the welfare of animals in the wild with academics. But I can think of multiple particular cases where that conversation has gone really well and the person has looked into kind of the historical background of our movement and gotten very wary of being associated with the movement, and I think that's a major issue. For people to kind of\u2026 the first content that they see when they Google \"wild animal suffering\" to be maybe not super accessible or be focused on very obscure issues or controversial issues. And so I can think multiple particular examples where people have kind of come back to me after I've had a very productive conversation with them and expressed some hesitance to continue working on&nbsp;this.</p><p>I think the other thing is, I've heard a lot of people say that they're interested in it, but a lack of funding is going to stop them from pursuing research in it. And so I think there's probably a lot of opportunity to reach out to\u2026 I mean there's individual decision makers in large scientific foundations that are doing funding, who good outreach to might be able to make a significant difference, because there's people who think this is important who just think they can't get the funding they would need right now to do research that they'd like to do. So I think there's potential there as&nbsp;well.</p><p><i>Kieran</i>: So I have fairly limited experience with this. So I feel like I do not have a great sense of it. I think that one thing to bear in mind with this question is that the academic field is split along different kind of disciplines so we have philosophy, biology, ecology, psychology. It's going to be different for different disciplines. I think that we'll need different approaches for different disciplines. I think it's also an empirical question and I think that something that could be useful here is having a survey of biologists or a survey of ecologists and seeing what their baseline views are. I think that something else that is important to communicate is that there is funders that are interested in this, so that you can be funded for this. The other thing I would say is that there's existing literature on this, and the other thing that I would say is that potentially some of the early publications in this field could be very prestigious because later on they would receive many&nbsp;citations.</p><p><i>Ozy</i>: One of the things I've noticed that is interesting to me is that there's a very positive response to wild animal suffering stuff from philosophers. There are several philosophers I can think of who are working on it fairly intensively. There's a surprisingly positive response from economists for some reason, but the natural sciences tend to be much lower uptake I've noticed, I'm not sure why that is. I am puzzled about the number of economists that are interested in wild animal&nbsp;suffering.</p><p>And another thing I've noticed is that there are a lot of people, academics I think in the natural sciences who care about wild animals, and believe that we should help wild animals, and think that the best thing that we can do for wild animals is to leave them alone. And I think that this is a fairly common position, and so I think\u2026 I'm not sure to what extent it's right and I think that that's something that we're going to have to engage with as a movement is the position of \"yes wild animals matter but we're not going to be able to improve their lives anymore than just by not polluting and not feeding them and so on and so&nbsp;forth.\"</p><p><i>Persis</i>: So two hurdles that have already come up are funding constraints and perhaps being too controversial too early on. I can think of another hurdle in terms of value differences which I think Ozy also mentioned. I'd be interested in your views on what other major hurdles there might be for academics getting involved, and so it would be interesting to see if there's a distinction between your experience talking to people in philosophy or people in economics or people in biology. And what some possible solutions might be. So if someone, if an academic tells you they're funding constrained, what is a way around that other than the obvious of giving their university funding, but how can we better support&nbsp;them?</p><p><i>Kieran</i>: Yeah so that's a really good question. One thing\u2026 so one approach that could be helpful here is having wild animal suffering as part of their research, not as the focus of their research, so incorporating that into their existing research, that could be useful in terms of them getting funding for that. I think that another thing that could be useful is focusing on academics who already have the tenure so they have the freedom to focus on these issues if they wish rather than focusing on these up and coming academics who are very much constrained in what they can publish&nbsp;on.</p><p><i>Ozy</i>: One project I think is very interesting is the effective thesis project, which is a project that lists a bunch of thesis ideas that effective altruists are interested in that are in a variety of different fields, with the idea that people who are doing a masters thesis or a PhD thesis or maybe even an undergraduate thesis would be able to look at them and then do work on these EA topics. I believe that a substantial number of the ideas in the effective thesis projects are wild animal suffering oriented right&nbsp;now.</p><p><i>Abraham</i>: Yeah I think there's a lot of potential in different kinds of advocacy within academia that aren't necessarily getting published research, especially editorial advocacy in journals. I think there's room for bibliographies on stuff that's already been published that is legitimate and there's room for just people arguing that there's more of a need for this field, and that usually doesn't have to be well funded research, that's something many academics are able to do with the resources they already have, and I think working with academics to get those published in legitimate science journals is definitely a way to help just create buzz about the field and get it&nbsp;established.</p><p><i>Persis</i>: That's great, let's move on now to communicating with animal rights or welfare advocates. When talking about wild animal suffering with advocates who are skeptical, what do you think is\u2026 well, how would you weigh a focus on social change versus a focus on pragmatic interventions, and I guess this question in part requires an understanding of, why might an advocate be skeptical? And so it might be interesting to first mention some of the skepticism that advocates have raised and then how you best think you can address it. Maybe we can start with&nbsp;Ozy?</p><p><i>Ozy</i>: Actually in my experience, a lot of the animal rights people I've talked to have been really receptive about wild animal suffering stuff, and in my experience the big objections that people have had is okay, but can we do something about this that is going to be a better way to help animals than dealing with farmed animal&nbsp;stuff?</p><p>That has been the biggest objection that I've had is people being like, we are totally concerned about suffering in nature but it's complicated. It's hard. There might be knock-on negative effects and we definitely know that trying to get rid of factory farming is going to&nbsp;positive.</p><p><i>Kieran</i>: So I think the biggest objection that I come across is that just now is not really the time for this. Now is more of a time for farmed animals. We should focus on farmed animals. Once we have the farmed animals situation under control, then we can move onto wild animals and I think I'm fairly sympathetic to that. What I would say is that I do lean more in a social change direction than the pragmatic intervention direction, and I think a large part of that is because I'm just not sure there really is any pragmatic interventions right now. So if we did have further research on this and we did identify some of those, I would certainly be open to updating on that, but until we do identify those, I think we should be leaning in impact social change&nbsp;direction.</p><p><i>Abraham</i>: Yeah. I don't know if I agree about there not being viable interventions right now but I definitely agree that social change is the way to go with many animal advocates. I think part of the reason is one of the best ways to sort of ensure that we might do something about wild animal suffering in the future is just, instilling broader values of compassion for animals in people and I think the group of people who does that really well is often the farmed animal advocacy movement. So if wild animals are part of the conversation as well, that seems really beneficial to the movement in the long&nbsp;run.</p><p>I also think that, yeah, definitely a lot of animal advocates are skeptical of some of the proposed interventions and maybe it's not the best idea to talk about those, but they're people who are just super compassionate and have a lot of empathy for animals often, and pointing to the suffering that is in nature, often they understand and see that that's a huge issue and aren't going to forget about that, so I think it's definitely worthwhile to do that kind of&nbsp;outreach.</p><p><i>Persis</i>: One follow-up question that came out of Kieran's response, so if we don't think that there are pragmatic interventions or viable interventions at the moment and instead we focus predominately on social change, does that hinder our ability to do research to then later on discover pragmatic interventions or do you think that they're not really mutually exclusive and you can both encourage social change whilst also doing the research on the&nbsp;side?</p><p><i>Kieran</i>: Yeah. I don't see them as mutually exclusive. I would say that it seems like a totally viable approach to do both. One thing I would say I think it would be helpful to have interventions that we could point out as possible examples because otherwise, people will kind of see this issue as too intractable, but if we do have these interventions they can serve a role as a psychological hook almost. So I think, yeah, it would be really helpful to have these, like, go-to interventions and I would still probably focus on the social change&nbsp;aspect.</p><p><i>Ozy</i>: I think that, I mean\u2026 I don't know that right now there are interventions that are viable interventions in the sense of, you should donate to this intervention instead of buy malaria nets for a people in the developing world, but I suspect that there are, with our current level of knowledge, interventions that we can be fairly certain are net positive: people, keep your cats inside and clean your bird&nbsp;feeders.</p><p>I think that being able to have these sorts of concrete interventions is really important for being able to do social change because I feel like if you just try to concentrate on getting people to care about wild animals then, you're like, okay people, care about wild animals. And then they're like okay, so what do we do now that we care about wild animals, and we're like oh, tell more people that you care about wild&nbsp;animals.</p><p><i>Ozy</i>: And then, it just, I feel like that's really unsatisfying for a lot of people and they're like why should I care about wild animals if I'm not going to get to do anything with my caring. So I think that being able to point to well, these are some things that we're working on, that said, I'm not sure that anything that we have right now is going to beat farmed animals or global poverty charities in terms of cost effectiveness. I'm optimistic that some of them will in the&nbsp;future.</p><p><i>Abraham</i>: I definitely agree that pointing to specific interventions, or specific calls to action, is really important but I also think the social change is a fundamental part of getting the pragmatic research done just because, I think a big barrier to people doing the research is the fact that it's not normalized to believe that we should do something about the suffering of wild animals and, you know, social change is the way that you normalize that, so if people Google wild animal suffering, there should be academics talking about it. There should be random people who like, have no background in this issue being like, yeah, wild animals are important and there's a lot of suffering. It should seem very normal to believe that we should do something about this.&nbsp;Yeah.</p><p><i>Ozy</i>: I think that we should do more research is in fact a concrete call to action, like, especially if you're targeting academics which, going back to the academics topic but, you know, being like we should care about wild animals and because you care about wild animals, you should do research into the prevalence of chronic stress in nature or whatever, is like, very much a concrete intervention that we can\u2026 a concrete thing that we can ask people to&nbsp;do.</p><p><i>Persis</i>: Yeah. So one thing I encounter when I have spoken to animal rights activists or advocates is when we come to talking about what viable interventions might be, I often come up against the intrinsic value of nature argument, and often it's very difficult to have this discussion with someone who maybe firstly, doesn't really recognize that they value nature intrinsically and secondly, because it's extremely difficult to try and shift values. I'd be interested in your experiences when you have encountered that and what are some smart ways that you've been able to address&nbsp;that?</p><p><i>Ozy</i>: One thing I try to point out to people is that, like, regardless of whether or not a non-intervene in nature would be a good thing, we don't have that option. It's not on the table. In fact, we are heating up the entire globe. There's pollution in the air. There's, you know the Scottish Highlands? They're that way because of sheep. They used to be forests. There used to be mammoths in America and then humans drove them&nbsp;extinct.</p><p>It might be nice to go back to having forests in the Scottish Highlands and mammoths, but we don't really have that option. Every city we have is an intervention into nature. The question is whether we're going to intervene into nature responsibly and with stewardship for the animals that are there, or whether we're just going to be like yes, we're going to intervene in nature in ways that benefit us and forget the animals that are&nbsp;there.</p><p><i>Kieran</i>: Yeah. I think I agree with all of that. What I would add is so one, it's an empirical question. We could do further research on this. We can survey people and see what messages they are most receptive to. The other point I would add is that yes, so we're already intervening in nature and, you know, in these ways that we're already intervening, are there better ways that we could be intervening? Kind of pointing these out. So perhaps something along the lines of, you know, wild-caught fish, if there's like more humane slaughter practices&nbsp;there.</p><p><i>Ozy</i>: Another thing I would point out is that we can, even if you are like, all I want to do is stop humans from intervening in nature, you can prioritize which environmentalist things you do based on, in part, on their effects on wild animals. For example, something like anthropogenic noise could have a very negative effect on fish and it is possible that from a perspective that's concerned about wild animals suffering, you're like, I'm going to care more about anthropogenic noise and maybe less about things that don't also cause harm to wild&nbsp;animals.</p><p><i>Abraham</i>: I think also fortunately, the environmentalist movement has just instilled some deep associations with specific language and again, we can use that language to talk about improving the lives of wild animals. So, I mean I think it is really important to move away from the idea of intervening in nature because that is, I think, at its core where people have this issue and talk about stewarding nature or participating in natural systems just because, again, people are much more receptive to talking about this if we frame it with language that they're comfortable with and that doesn't seem sort of immediately&nbsp;bad.</p><p><i>Ozy</i>: One final thing that I've noticed is that a lot of people that have problems with interventions in general don't have problems with concrete interventions. Like, if you're like, okay you have a problem with interventions in general, do you have a problem with the existence of bird feeders? They're like no. Do you have a problem with wildlife care centers where they help injured wildlife? They're like no. And you're like\u2026 so I suspect to a certain degree this problem will go away if we have a concrete interventions and then they will be like yes, I oppose intervention but like, that thing you're doing with wildlife contraception is&nbsp;great.</p><p><i>Abraham</i>: And I also think, on that note, there are historical successes in, sort of, participating in natural systems to improve the lives of wild animals. So, giving wild horses contraceptives to reduce their population and decrease competition for resources in the Western US, or, like, eradicating the screw worm which was a fly that not only\u2026 most screw worms lived bad lives themselves, but they laid eggs in the skins of mammals and caused these awful injuries and we got rid of them in North America, and I think there's probably not that many people that would have been opposed to that project. Or in 2016, in Monroe County, Florida, like 57 percent of the population voted or 50 percent of voters agreed to a referendum to get rid of mosquitoes in the area by introducing, like, males who would produce sterile offspring or offspring who wouldn't live to adulthood. I think when we can point to specific examples where we think we will succeed or we have succeeded in the past, people are actually, often, fairly comfortable with&nbsp;it.</p><p><i>Persis</i>: So one thing that comes out from the responses that you've given is the\u2026 talking about the role that we have with the environment so the role that we play in nature and Abraham, you pointed out that stewardship in nature is a much more effective communication approach than interventions. Can you give us a little bit more detail in terms of how you describe a steward of nature and what are some fundamental differences between this idea of intervening and stewarding when in practice, they involve very similar&nbsp;activities?</p><p><i>Abraham</i>: Yeah. Absolutely. So for reference, this was a study that we've done twice now on the same language and literally the exact same paragraph with the verbs changed made people much more receptive to this. And so, that just suggests that, I think people have really positive associations with the word stewardship. It's the phrase that the conservation movement has used for a long time for describing conserving nature. But when we used it to describe projects that would probably come across as, like, pretty offensive to many people like literally removing predators or something like that from an ecosystem, people had, still showed we got not nearly the kind of decrease in support that we got when we used the word&nbsp;intervene.</p><p>So I think, yeah, we can describe humans as compassionate stewards of natural systems who are there to improve the well-being of animals and whose role in nature is being some kind of arbiter. And I think, if we use that positive language, that makes us seem compassionate. It makes us seem empathetic to the animals whom we're helping or sparing. Then it's not so kind of offensive as making us seem like sort of this cruel dictator who's stepping&nbsp;in.</p><p><i>Ozy</i>: It also makes me think that it's a connection to a lot of religious beliefs about animals that I think the stewardship idea is very big in the Abrahamic religions. For like, humans being chosen by God to be stewards of nature which might make it more powerful for a lot of&nbsp;people.</p><p><i>Persis</i>: Great. One last question in this category and this is, maybe we'll start with Ozy for this one because Ozy's been working on this, a question that has come up for us a lot is how different views within animal rights and animal advocacy can support wild animal suffering or how you might respond to wild animal suffering based on these views? And the one that I think stands out the most is a rights-based view, and so Ozy recently wrote a post on crucial considerations for wild animal suffering which briefly touched on this, and we'll be working on some posts following this. I'd be interested in getting all of your thoughts on how a rights-based view, how you might frame wild animal suffering for supporters of a rights-based view and we'll start with Ozy and then go&nbsp;down.</p><p><i>Ozy</i>: One thing I would point out for people in a rights-based view is that there are many animals which are called synanthropic animals that are ones that have co-evolved with humans but not as domestic animals. There are species like pigeons, rats and mice, even some bugs, and often, people in a rights-based view are like, we have this obligation to domestic animals because of how our actions have led to violations of their rights. We don't have this obligation to wild animals. And I think that like, at the very least a rights-based view implies that we have a certain duty of beneficence to the synanthropic&nbsp;species.</p><p>Although I admit that it's probably not going to be a very popular position that we don't have any moral obligations to deer but we do have more obligations to&nbsp;rats.</p><p><i>Kieran</i>: Yeah. So I feel like I haven't thought about this question a lot. When I think about wild animal suffering, this to me, feels like not the most tractable lever to be pulling on. I think that potentially they could be framing it around fairness and equality that a rights-based view would find appealing. I think that you could frame things in terms of, you know, under current conditions, sudden rights are not being met, even though animals plausibly could have some, like, a right to non-interference, because their rights are not being met under current conditions. This is overwhelming that. I think that would be my initial reaction to&nbsp;that.</p><p><i>Abraham</i>: Yeah. I mean I don't think there's any conflicts between advocating for more research into the suffering of wild animals and a rights-based view, so I think that's like completely possible and straightforward. I also think there's great examples of, I mean, often projects to reduce wild animal suffering are framed as being, sort of, anti-natalist like ways to reduce the suffering especially of young animals who die painful deaths at a very young age. And, of course, many people in this room participate in the farmed-animal advocacy movement, which is all an anti-natalist project as well and it's not framed that way. We don't talk about eating vegan diets as like working to make cows not exist, and I think we can think about the framing that the farmed-animal advocacy movement has used, which is there are animals who are living terrible lives and there's something we can do so they don't live terrible&nbsp;lives.</p><p>I think the things that would kind of violate a rights framework would be, you know, if we're talking about going and actively injuring or like, you know, euthanizing animals in the wild and instead we can talk about going in and providing birth control to animals who would have offspring who would compete with each other for resources. I think you pretty much get the same result without violating anyone's rights in those instances and people are very comfortable with that. I think it's also a much more pleasant thing as animal advocates who care about animals to&nbsp;do.</p><p><i>Ozy</i>: I think ultimately what it comes down to is that if you are doing something wrong when there is a lion who is like, bothering a two-year-old or is about to attack a two-year-old and you're like eh, I'm gonna ignore that. Then you are also kind of doing something wrong if you see a lion about to attack a zebra and you're like, I'm not gonna do anything about that. Otherwise, it's speciesist. It's treating humans and non-human animals differently simply on the basis of our species&nbsp;membership.</p><p><i>Persis</i>: Great. So we've got about 20 minutes to go. I want to move on to our next topic which is intervention, so there's a lot of disagreement, I think, amongst wild animal welfare advocates for which sort of interventions we should be considering and how we should best be communicating interventions. Do we want to communicate mostly large-scale interventions or should we focus on what individuals can do? How much should we be discussing the relative intractability of some ideas? How much should we be promoting only those that are very viable or only those that are most likely to be adopted? What I want to start with is some useful strategies against the case that when we have intervened in nature in the past, we've only made things worse and that we don't really have a very good picture of what the flow-through effects of our actions might&nbsp;be.</p><p><i>Abraham</i>: Yeah. So often when people say something like this, I actually just ask them well, like, if they can name a time when we've intervened in nature to improve the welfare of wild animals and often, yeah, we build subdivisions. We like build factories that dump chemicals into rivers, and that does have unintended environmental consequences but we weren't doing those things to make the lives of wild animals better. We were doing those things for other&nbsp;reasons.</p><p>It's obvious that we can't really expect them to produce the results we might want, like helping wild animals. And I think there's lots of historical examples of us having done things for wild animals that turned out good for the wild animals in the way that we wanted it to. Again, like the eradication of the screw worm or providing contraception to horses, or rabies vaccines for raccoons or other wildlife, and I think pointing to these projects can definitely just help people realize that this is actually fairly tractable to do. Again, I also don't think impact assessment is really where the lack of knowledge is. We have this incredibly robust field of environmental impact assessment work that's been done just by for-profit companies who want to start, like build mines and things like that, just due to environmental regulation. There's great rubrics that researchers have made for doing this work, and I think a lot of that can be translated to looking into the welfare of wild animals, but that just hasn't happened yet. I don't think it's actually as hard to do as some people make it out. Maybe thinking about the consequences over decades and decades is complicated, but in the short term I think it's very&nbsp;possible.</p><p><i>Kieran</i>: Yes, I think that I would express some limited agreement here and I think I would say things along the lines of, \u201cI agree, we should be cautious and we do need further research, but with further research we can reduce uncertainty about these questions.\u201d I think that we can also point at ways where we do already intervene in nature and do these interventions more effectively in order to improve the welfare of wild animals. I think just to pick up on what Abraham was saying, so things like vaccinations of raccoons, yeah I think these would be the main things that I would&nbsp;mention.</p><p><i>Ozy</i>: What I would say is that this applies to every interaction we have with nature. As a matter of fact, nobody goes, \u201cOh I don't know whether having a larger wildlife refuge or a smaller wildlife refuge is going to make it easier to conserve species. Maybe if we bulldoze the entire rainforest, it'll make it easier to control rainforest species.\u201d In fact, there are things we know about nature, such as the fact that bulldozing the entire rainforest will not make it easier to preserve rainforest species. I think that it is true that intervening in nature is complicated and that there are a lot of\u2026 that we need to be careful, and that there are a lot of unexpected flow-through effects, but in fact there are ways that we can make predictions and say, \u201cOkay, we think that this thing is going to have that effect.\u201d Otherwise we couldn't do environmental conservation at&nbsp;all.</p><p><i>Persis</i>: To what extent do you think a consideration like whether or not nature is unpredictable impacts the way we talk about strategies? Is it something that we might want to be working on now so that we have an answer to this question in the future or is it something that we might just learn whilst working on our interventions, whilst working on developing&nbsp;interventions?</p><p><i>Abraham</i>: Yeah, I think it's fairly unlikely that we'll be able to kind of know everything until we've started developing interventions, but again there's been a ton of work done on populations and the way that they're impacted by human activities already. I think it's probably the case that there could be a lot done to just translate that work to the language of welfare, and understand how our past activities have impacted animals in order to form how our future ones&nbsp;might.</p><p><i>Kieran</i>: I think something that I'd find really helpful here is if we had go-to examples. I think that Abraham already mentioned screw worms, so if we had this list of go-to examples of ways in which we've intervened in the environment and it turned out positively for wild animals that would be really, really helpful. I think that again it's worth being cautious in our approach here and not overstepping, and saying we do need further research. Yes, these are complicated ecosystems. Population dynamics aren't easily predicted. Yeah, I think this is how I would&nbsp;respond.</p><p><i>Ozy</i>: Yeah, I'm pretty much in agreement with you&nbsp;guys.</p><p><i>Persis</i>: Great. The next question that I had is how beneficial do you think it is, and we'll break this down into the short term and the long term, to align people by referring to small scale things we can do. Like helping injured animals on the side of the road, providing them with veterinary care, providing small scale supplemental feeding when we have small numbers of animals that might be starving throughout a winter, or vaccination programs. In the short term, how useful do you think this might be? And then in the longer term, do you expect there to be some barriers to moving people on to considering large scale interventions that might not look the same&nbsp;way?</p><p><i>Ozy</i>: I think it's really, one thing that's really important about recommending small scale interventions is to make sure to recommend things that actually have positive effects and not that have negative or neutral effects. One of the things I see, I think when people do intervention based messaging is, \u201cOh supplemental feeding.\u201d Well, I've actually just written a very long paper on this and I think that supplemental feeding actually is probably negative for animals in most cases. I think that if we're going to be talking about small scale interventions, we should make sure that they are ones that actually help animals and not ones that are going to make situations&nbsp;worse.</p><p><i>Kieran</i>: Yeah, I totally agree with that. The other thing I would say on it is that I think these small scale interventions are helpful as psychological hooks, and people don't just reject the idea as something that is intractable and there's nothing that we can do about it. I think that, plausibly, some of these interventions could be quite cost effective, so I think that on that front they could be just very&nbsp;promising.</p><p>I would say, my understanding of the situation is that the end goal here is going to be a large scale intervention in nature where we are dramatically changing ecosystems, or dramatically changing kind of how animals are interacting with each other, and that does seem like a significant step&nbsp;up.</p><p>I feel like we do need a lot more research, that obviously this is quite far down the line, We're talking decades or perhaps close to a century where we're at this point, but hopefully at that point we'll have a lot more research. The values of the public will be significantly different from what they are now and we can just have a public discussion about it and\u2026 yeah, I think that that's what I would say for&nbsp;that.</p><p><i>Ozy</i>: I think right now a lot of the more large scale interventions, things like Brian Tomasik's ideas about habitat destruction or David Pearce's ideas about genetically engineering lions to eat plants, are things that people tend to find really upsetting. I do think that people should be authentic and generally say, if you genuinely believe that we should concentrate our energy on trying to genetically engineer lions to eat plants, I think you should say that, but I also think that one thing to take into account when we're talking about these sorts of things is that there are a lot of people who might get on board with wildlife contraception or with cutting back on anthropogenic noise or something smaller scale like that are just going to totally bounce off of some of the whole larger scale&nbsp;ones.</p><p><i>Abraham</i>: Yeah. I mean I think again, well first of all framing is everything, you know. Paving over a woods with concrete is the exact same thing as advocating for veganism in terms of the way it helps animals, but I'm sure you all have radically different, you all have radically different responses to those two kinds of things. And that's for a very good reason, which is that we need to frame things positively. We have to frame it as directly helping the animals, even though those animals might never exist. I think it's all about the way we talk about these things ultimately. I do think it's fairly helpful to kind of create tropes of just helping wild&nbsp;animals.</p><p>I think in the long run, if we need broad public support to do large scale interventions, people also have to be comfortable with the idea that they sort of have daily obligations to help the wild animals they see in need, even though it's hard to know exactly how they're helping those wild animals in certain cases. I think there's plenty of examples of people who do regularly sort of help wild animals on a small scale and there's probably useful research to be done sort of comparing their attitudes towards larger scale interventions against people who might ignore injured wild animals or something. And maybe this is also, to some extent an empirical&nbsp;question.</p><p><i>Persis</i>: One distinction that I can see between also small scale and large scale interventions is that, for example, supplemental feeding for one starving deer might be particularly beneficial and improve the well being of that particular deer's life. But then when you translate it onto a larger scale, it becomes less likely to be a positive intervention. So how would you try\u2026 what are some strategies you could use to communicate that one intervention might be a useful trope, but when you try and expand it, it becomes something that we don't want to advocate&nbsp;for?</p><p><i>Ozy</i>: I think personally, I tend to think we should advocate less for people to do individual actions and more for people to be engaged politically on this issue. I mean when we have an intervention. Partially because I think the sorts of things that the government can do will be much more cost effective, and partially because I think it is generally a hard sell for people to do individual actions, particularly individual actions that cause a lot of sacrifice. As an example, try talking people into becoming vegan. It's&nbsp;hard.</p><p>But I think if people are like, \"Oh I should write a letter to my congressperson about expanding the use of humane insecticides,\" or something. This is something where they get to feel good about themselves and it has a concrete benefit for the world, and it's not hard. It's not a major sacrifice. I think that what I would recommend is not for people to do these smaller scale interventions, but instead to have, I guess maybe a medium scale intervention. Something that's in between feeding one deer and complete reorganization of the entire ecosystem, but is to get people to advocate for at least more sort of medium scale interventions is what I would argue&nbsp;for.</p><p><i>Persis</i>: Great. Another discussion that often comes up amongst wild animals suffering, people who would like to reduce wild animal suffering, is the benefit of discussing this idea of a happiness to suffering ratio, or net disvalue or value in nature. I'd be really interested in your thoughts on how useful it is to firstly, frame the problem in this way and then how useful it is to try and\u2026 How you would best address these conversations. Let's start with Kieran,&nbsp;then.</p><p><i>Kieran</i>: I think for now I would stay away from, kind of, net suffering in nature and the idea that some wild animals are wildly negative. I think I would, probably wouldn't frame it in terms of either net happiness or net suffering. I would frame things in terms of just improving welfare, improving quality of&nbsp;life.</p><p><i>Abraham</i>: I mean, I think I wouldn't use the phrase like, net suffering, but I probably would frame it to some extent that way just insofar as I think it's really important to describe individual animals and what individual animals' experiences are like. And then also describe the massive scope of how many terrible experiences like that there are. That is getting at sort of the net suffering in a sense and pointing to how massive this issue is, but maybe not use so jargony&nbsp;language.</p><p><i>Ozy</i>: I don't really talk about net suffering or net happiness in nature because I personally don't feel like I know whether there's net suffering or net happiness in nature. I feel like this question depends on a lot of difficult philosophical issues. It depends on a lot of individual details about what a individual animal's life is&nbsp;like.</p><p>I think that a lot of the arguments for net suffering in nature either hinge on the experience of dying being extremely bad, which is I think something that many people are going to question. I think that other arguments depend on assumptions about what it must be like to experience the risk of predation, which often are a little bit anthropomorphic. So I end up not using the net suffering versus net happiness in nature framing just because I don't know which side of that I would fall on, and I am not sure\u2026 I think we would have to collect a lot of information before I would be comfortable having an opinion on that. That is a really big&nbsp;question.</p><p><i>Persis</i>: Any further thoughts? Well, we have a few minutes I think. Two minutes? I just have one very general question, which I think is important for anyone who wants to be an advocate regardless of whether you're advocating for wild animal suffering or another issue, which is to do with communication approaches that are just particularly useful in terms of preventing, well in terms of bringing people on board, engaging them and avoiding alienating people. I'd be interested in your thoughts about smart communication strategies when you disagree with someone. Perhaps behavioral strategies that have been really useful. Generally the sorts of approaches that you've found have worked best when you engage in&nbsp;disagreements.</p><p><i>Abraham</i>: Yeah. Well, first of all, I have an article about this so feel free to reach out to me or ask me and I'll send you the link. I think in general, not referring to particular stewardship projects. If you do refer to them, call them things like that instead of interventions in nature and then also when people get antagonistic, just say, \"Well, I think we need to do a lot more research and learn a lot more about what the lives of wild animals are like.\" And I think very few people disagree with that claim and it's a really good middle ground that most people will agree with you&nbsp;on.</p><p><i>Kieran</i>: Yeah, I would say try to generally try and understand the other person's position as well as you can before starting to criticize that position. Be charitable, so don't infer bad motivations. Don't jump to a conclusion that they're insulting you or they're insulting a school of thought before you really have to. Try and have a prolonged discussion. Try and have private discussions to avoid the posturing that can go on. Certainly in person things are going to be, people I think will just be more agreeable than online. And I also think that there could be room for adversarial collaborations on these&nbsp;topics.</p><p><i>Ozy</i>: One thing that I think is really important is honesty. I think that there is a real tendency when you're promoting a charity, when you're promoting a cause to be like, \"Oh people can't understand this really complicated thing that I believe. I should try to simplify it. I should try to like, instead of talking about this weird, complicated thing I believe, I should try and present something that's simpler. And I don't really think it's true, but maybe it will persuade them.\" I think you should be honest. I think you should say the downsides, the flaws of your position if you have them. You should say the problems with your prose interventions. You should say the thing you actually believe, even if it is weird and might be off putting. I think that not trying to do PR, public relations, too hard is a really important thing in the effective altruist&nbsp;movement.</p><p>The reason that the effective altruist movement exists at all is that there are a bunch of charities who, instead of trying to tell the truth about what their charities are doing, are trying to optimize for getting the most money and the most support. That is why effective altruism exists and can exist, and people aren't just all donating to the best charity to begin with. And so, I think that, as part of that, we as effective altruists need to make a particular effort to communicate the downsides of our positions, communicate things that make our position weaker than it would otherwise be, and say things that are true even if they might make people less likely to believe&nbsp;us.</p><p><i>Persis</i>: Great.

I spend about half my time in biosecurity right now. Specifically, when I work on biosecurity, I'm thinking about it in the context of global catastrophic biological risks, by which we mean, in case you haven't heard that term before, risks that could, if they occurred, have the potential to derail or destroy human civilization in the long-term. And so when we think about biosecurity, we're thinking about it in the context of our efforts to make sure the long-term future is good, as opposed to focusing primarily on efforts to help people now. Open Phil does more to help people now through our programs in US policy, as well as global health and&nbsp;development.</p><p>I've been thinking about bio in effective altruism and effective altruism in biosecurity a lot this year, and I want to share a few of my thoughts on that topic. I'm going to try to communicate some of what I've learned and done this year, focusing on some recent projects. I've kind of split this into some projects, and sort of analysis areas, which is a soft term I'm using for things that I've been thinking about that I think are important for people who are interested in this space to keep in mind, and some of what I've learned from that. These are examples. They're not comprehensive lists of what I've done or been thinking about. I selected them because I thought they might be of interest and I'm definitely going to try to leave time for&nbsp;questions.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4IiLLk6QcEsUQqGW0SuwqO/640f86a6bcd9862881861b456702b6eb/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__1_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4IiLLk6QcEsUQqGW0SuwqO/640f86a6bcd9862881861b456702b6eb/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__1_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4IiLLk6QcEsUQqGW0SuwqO/640f86a6bcd9862881861b456702b6eb/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__1_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4IiLLk6QcEsUQqGW0SuwqO/640f86a6bcd9862881861b456702b6eb/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__1_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4IiLLk6QcEsUQqGW0SuwqO/640f86a6bcd9862881861b456702b6eb/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__1_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4IiLLk6QcEsUQqGW0SuwqO/640f86a6bcd9862881861b456702b6eb/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__1_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4IiLLk6QcEsUQqGW0SuwqO/640f86a6bcd9862881861b456702b6eb/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__1_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>The first thing I want to talk about was our project in early-career funding. Our idea was to fund grad programs and internships in fields or in organizations related to biosecurity, with the goal of helping to get people who are relatively value aligned with our view on biosecurity, who are interested in global catastrophic biological risks in particular, have an easier time moving into that field. We also wanted to help them make the transition potentially more quickly. Give them more time to do work without having as much a pressure from other needs, like financial&nbsp;constraints.</p><p>We've accepted six applicants and I'm really happy with what all of those applicants are doing. Happy to see actually some of them in this crowd. Congratulations! We haven't announced it quite yet because one person is still deciding, but we're going to announce that later. Right now we're thinking about whether to renew that program. We're just considering it. We're really curious for feedback from other people on whether that would be a helpful thing for them. Something that would help them do something related to global catastrophic biological risks quickly or earlier, or not. We're not very clear on the extent to which money is or isn't a limiting factor in this. We also are kind of worried about over-pushing a career path that we don't yet understand very well and that we're not sure is the best&nbsp;one.</p><p>There's a kind of risk that I'm holding in my mind that our funding in the space could be taken as a strong endorsement of certain routes or paths, and we're not sure that those are the best paths. So we want to be wary of that tension, and we want people to go out and explore, and we want to learn more about how people can have an impact in this space, but it doesn't feel like something that we're highly certain about. And this feels connected to a later topic I want to discuss, which is sort of what's EA's niche in biosecurity? I think that there are a lot of possible answers to that question, but I don't think that we're yet at the stage where we can have solid conclusions about&nbsp;it.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6ADvLk7VZeMOQ8EiCMsEwY/0b44f68994d93da38066c60a973be26b/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__2_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6ADvLk7VZeMOQ8EiCMsEwY/0b44f68994d93da38066c60a973be26b/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__2_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6ADvLk7VZeMOQ8EiCMsEwY/0b44f68994d93da38066c60a973be26b/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__2_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6ADvLk7VZeMOQ8EiCMsEwY/0b44f68994d93da38066c60a973be26b/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__2_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6ADvLk7VZeMOQ8EiCMsEwY/0b44f68994d93da38066c60a973be26b/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__2_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6ADvLk7VZeMOQ8EiCMsEwY/0b44f68994d93da38066c60a973be26b/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__2_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6ADvLk7VZeMOQ8EiCMsEwY/0b44f68994d93da38066c60a973be26b/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__2_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>The second project is a write-up on viral pathogen research and development. Most of this work was done by our program officers in scientific research, who I have little pictures of: Heather Youngs and Chris Somerville. This was a medium-depth investigation into the space, and it focused a lot on antivirals and vaccines. We did this because we really wanted to learn both about the space in general and about whether there might be good funding opportunities available to Open Philanthropy when we dug into it more deeply. And so, some kind of quick takeaways from that; I thought it was really interesting what we learned. The most interesting part, I think to me, was just this idea that there are many novel vaccine types, and that those may or may not bear fruit in the future, but that we couldn't identify a lot of really hard scientific barriers to making very fast effective&nbsp;vaccines.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/Q6josxDNwA6YowSKwCIIE/d4b6a4fe14d77db25a38a5a7679196e2/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__3_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/Q6josxDNwA6YowSKwCIIE/d4b6a4fe14d77db25a38a5a7679196e2/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__3_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/Q6josxDNwA6YowSKwCIIE/d4b6a4fe14d77db25a38a5a7679196e2/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__3_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/Q6josxDNwA6YowSKwCIIE/d4b6a4fe14d77db25a38a5a7679196e2/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__3_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/Q6josxDNwA6YowSKwCIIE/d4b6a4fe14d77db25a38a5a7679196e2/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__3_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/Q6josxDNwA6YowSKwCIIE/d4b6a4fe14d77db25a38a5a7679196e2/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__3_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/Q6josxDNwA6YowSKwCIIE/d4b6a4fe14d77db25a38a5a7679196e2/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__3_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>I expect that some might well exist and that also many logistical difficulties that aren't related to hard scientific barriers might exist. But it seems sort of like a ripe area for further learning and experimentation to figure out what we really need to do before we can be more likely to create very fast vaccines in the event of an emergency. Perhaps one involving an awful novel pathogen against which we don't already have treatments. We also looked a little bit into antivirals and found that they've in general received a lot less attention recently. One theory about why this is would be that antivirals are less useful to some extent in the developing world, where people have irregular or low access to hospitals and health care professionals, because you kind of need to take antivirals quickly right around the time that you get infected with a virus. And then also, some of them are not hugely efficacious against a broad range of viruses. For that reason we thought maybe it was a little bit under-explored, and there might be opportunities&nbsp;there.</p><p>In particular we looked at chaperone inhibitor proteins. Chaperone proteins are proteins that help your body fold new proteins it's creating into the right shape. So they kind of like \"chaperone\" them into being the right form to be functional. And inhibitors obviously inhibit that process. That sounds like a bad thing, because you obviously want your proteins to be functional. But we thought that it could have a potential for helping deal with viruses, because viruses also are hijacking your body's machinery to fold their proteins into the right shape. And if you could inhibit that process it might reduce the amount of viral replication. Of course, that would have some side effects, so it's probably not something that would be worth it to do for something like the common&nbsp;cold.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/kPaw00pqXmgQsu8M04GkO/3fb3cc6aedffe43034d222a3fe5c209b/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__4_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/kPaw00pqXmgQsu8M04GkO/3fb3cc6aedffe43034d222a3fe5c209b/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__4_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/kPaw00pqXmgQsu8M04GkO/3fb3cc6aedffe43034d222a3fe5c209b/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__4_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/kPaw00pqXmgQsu8M04GkO/3fb3cc6aedffe43034d222a3fe5c209b/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__4_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/kPaw00pqXmgQsu8M04GkO/3fb3cc6aedffe43034d222a3fe5c209b/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__4_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/kPaw00pqXmgQsu8M04GkO/3fb3cc6aedffe43034d222a3fe5c209b/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__4_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/kPaw00pqXmgQsu8M04GkO/3fb3cc6aedffe43034d222a3fe5c209b/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__4_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>But there's a little bit of evidence from cancer patients that the side effects might actually not be so severe and they might be worthwhile if you were, for example, infected with a very potentially deadly virus. We also have funded this research in David Baker's lab, and he's attempting to make a universal flu vaccine, which is definitely a long shot, but it's something that would be really amazing if it succeeded, because flu is both surprisingly deadly, killing lots of people every year, and also one of the viruses with the potential to maybe mutate into an even more deadly and dangerous form. In the flu virus, there are these kind of outer parts, which is what your body usually recognizes and tries to fight off. And then it has these inner parts that are highly conserved across many different strains of flu. So the outer parts are mutating rapidly and are different between different flu viruses. This is an oversimplification, but approximately true, and then these more inner parts are more&nbsp;conserved.</p><p>The idea is if you could get your body to be exposed to these inner parts that it's not normally exposed to, then it might be able to actually be immunized against many different types of flu, as opposed to just developing immunity to one type of flu, and then it mutates and then it no longer has immunity. So he's trying to create these proteins that have those inner parts more on the outside, and where your body can potentially induce production of broadly neutralizing antibodies, which are antibodies would neutralize many different strains of flu. So we're interested in that research, like with most of our scientific research funding, we think there's a good chance that it won't come to anything, but it's part of our philosophy of hits-based giving to, when we think a long shot could be worth it, try to give it support&nbsp;nonetheless.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1bBeepYKBuSS82GcSsyoai/d51afb4591aac7645ea88bf6e925b0ef/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__5_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1bBeepYKBuSS82GcSsyoai/d51afb4591aac7645ea88bf6e925b0ef/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__5_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1bBeepYKBuSS82GcSsyoai/d51afb4591aac7645ea88bf6e925b0ef/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__5_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1bBeepYKBuSS82GcSsyoai/d51afb4591aac7645ea88bf6e925b0ef/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__5_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1bBeepYKBuSS82GcSsyoai/d51afb4591aac7645ea88bf6e925b0ef/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__5_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1bBeepYKBuSS82GcSsyoai/d51afb4591aac7645ea88bf6e925b0ef/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__5_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1bBeepYKBuSS82GcSsyoai/d51afb4591aac7645ea88bf6e925b0ef/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__5_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Now I want to talk a little bit about the different areas of analysis I've been thinking about that are specifically related to involvement in global catastrophic biological risks, and are kind of common concerns I think especially in the EA space, and ones that I would love to get more people thinking about.

This concept was coined by Nick Bostrom. The Unilateralist's Curse is the idea that if there's lots of actors, even if they all have good intentions and they all have the ability to take an action, we should expect that even if it's a bad action, some of them might wrongly think it's a good action and take that action. And so overall, with sufficiently large number of actors, it becomes fairly likely that an action will be taken, and if that action is something like a publishing a piece of information then it really only matters if one person does it. That's basically as bad as lots of people doing it because once it's on the Internet, then anyone can see it. This is also a Bostrom concept. Bostrom is very interested in these types of concepts. Here's some little graphs that might help illustrate&nbsp;them.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/MLYdj8tgWYMM4oSqUKM2K/7574d62b862198dfed837a1c5555c6e9/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__7_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/MLYdj8tgWYMM4oSqUKM2K/7574d62b862198dfed837a1c5555c6e9/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__7_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/MLYdj8tgWYMM4oSqUKM2K/7574d62b862198dfed837a1c5555c6e9/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__7_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/MLYdj8tgWYMM4oSqUKM2K/7574d62b862198dfed837a1c5555c6e9/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__7_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/MLYdj8tgWYMM4oSqUKM2K/7574d62b862198dfed837a1c5555c6e9/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__7_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/MLYdj8tgWYMM4oSqUKM2K/7574d62b862198dfed837a1c5555c6e9/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__7_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/MLYdj8tgWYMM4oSqUKM2K/7574d62b862198dfed837a1c5555c6e9/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__7_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>And so I think these are important concepts for people who are interested in work in biosecurity, especially in the EA community. The EA community, really, I think people love to work together and talk about things online, hash through tough concepts. And I think that's one of its best qualities actually, but I think this is an area where we need to be a little bit more circumspect about some of that and a little bit more careful. So that's why I wanted to highlight it. I think that we need to kind of work together, and sometimes I think being aware of these concepts will involve doing things that feel overly conservative to you according to your feelings. But if you're never doing something that feels overly conservative to you, then you might be falling prey to this, this kind of curse&nbsp;idea.</p><p>A real example in my mind, in my actual work, is that there's a person with whom I really want to share a certain document and I really think it would be great to share this document with this person. They're really smart, they could be a really great ally, and I think that the downsides are minimal. I don't think they're going to do anything inappropriate with the information. But a key adviser of mine really doesn't agree with that and I really respect that person's judgment. And so even though in this particular instance, it kind of feels silly and excessive to me, I'm not going to share this document with this person until my adviser changes their mind, or if they don't change their mind, then I won't ever do that. And the way I think about that is if I released info every time I felt like it, soon enough I'd probably make a mistake. And if everyone did that, then we would really only be as safe as our least cautious person, which feels like a pretty bad place to be&nbsp;in.</p><p>I think that this is an area where coordination around these concepts is important. Especially in the beginning, when we don't totally know what we're doing, we're still figuring things out. It's pretty good to err on the side of conservatism and not do anything irreversible. I think when you're taking an action you should just think about the upsides and downsides, not just of you, but of all the similar people like you having a similar policy. Does that, in expectation, add up to disaster? If so, don't do it. But I also want to highlight that I don't think there's an easy answer here and too much conservatism itself has really negative impacts. It makes it really hard to recruit. It makes it hard for people to understand what they should do and prioritize within the space. And it's harder for people to take up and make informed decisions. It takes up a ton of time and energy thinking about it. So I don't think just like, \"be super conservative\" is a good policy either. We actually just have to figure out how to walk a really tough line and strike a really tough balance. But we should do that in a coordinated fashion because if we are all striking our own balance that won't be very&nbsp;efficient.</p><p>Last, I want to talk about just some thinking on EAs and biosecurity and where we may or may not have a niche. And I think focusing on global catastrophic biological risks in particular, both fits with a lot of our values and might be an under-explored area. I think thinking about what efforts might be broadly useful is a good thing to do, especially things that are only useful in the event of a really bad emergency. The antivirals that I was talking about recently are a good example of that. Things which are not normally useful for more day-to-day issues might be under-explored by people who are focusing mostly on those day-to-day issues. So if you kind of think about what in particular is only useful in a worst-case scenario, that might be a fruitful avenue of&nbsp;inquiry.</p><p>Other broad areas are things that address state risk, risk from states, or risks from a synthetic biology on the cutting edge areas where there's not a lot of precedent, there's not a lot of pressure on most people in government to work on those because they haven't yet occurred or people don't know about them. There's not a lot of public pressure, but they also could potentially lead to greater catastrophes than what we see coming out of nature. But I think a lot more work is needed to outline these career paths. As I said, thanks to those of you who are working on this and helping with this because I think it's just really valuable and hopefully we'll have a lot more specific information to say next&nbsp;year.</p><p>The last thing I want to say is just there's kind of longish timelines working in this space, and so patience here is a virtue. It might be good to start thinking most early on about the distinction between technical work versus policy work. Kind of a la AI, if you are following work in that space, because maybe that might determine whether you want to go into a more bio-science focused PhD or other grad program versus learning more about policy. Although my sense is that starting out in the more technical area is the kind of option preserving strategy because it's easier to switch from technical work to non-technical work, than non-technical work to technical work, based on what I've heard from people I've talked&nbsp;to.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/43ymJY1YliqmSqseQmaK0S/c93dfabaed93b1e569628176feef148e/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__8_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/43ymJY1YliqmSqseQmaK0S/c93dfabaed93b1e569628176feef148e/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__8_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/43ymJY1YliqmSqseQmaK0S/c93dfabaed93b1e569628176feef148e/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__8_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/43ymJY1YliqmSqseQmaK0S/c93dfabaed93b1e569628176feef148e/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__8_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/43ymJY1YliqmSqseQmaK0S/c93dfabaed93b1e569628176feef148e/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__8_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/43ymJY1YliqmSqseQmaK0S/c93dfabaed93b1e569628176feef148e/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__8_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/43ymJY1YliqmSqseQmaK0S/c93dfabaed93b1e569628176feef148e/EAG_BPP_talk_2018_Final__8_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Some EA orgs are focusing on expanding their work on this. FHI and Open Phil are the most obvious ones. We're trying to learn about this a lot. We might expand our teams. And so I think helping with that could be an amazing option for those of you who are interested. But other than that, I think that we should all think of this as a nascent area that's still in flux in information, where we might be changing our advice next year. We might think that different things are valuable next year and people who are sticking with it are functioning as these forward scouts, helping us understand what's going on, and it's not yet a mature area. And so I'm really grateful again to everyone here who's helping with&nbsp;that.</p><h1>Q&amp;A</h1><p><i>Question</i>: How neglected of a field do you think biosecurity is currently, especially compared to other cause areas such as AI safety and nuclear security, how do you see Open Phil fitting into the space, and how do you see other young, motivated EAs who want to enter this&nbsp;space?</p><p><i>Claire</i>: That's a really good question. I think it's still something we're trying to understand. I certainly think if you took like, number of people who would identify as working in biosecurity or millions of dollars that are identified as going to support efforts in biosecurity, it would be much, much higher than the same numbers would be in AI or AI safety. I'm not sure about nuclear security. My sense would be that that would be even bigger, although maybe Crystal would know more about&nbsp;that.</p><p>But I think that the relevant question here is to what extent is existing work on biosecurity relevant to global catastrophic biological risk? I think that that varies depending on the specific intervention or type of effort that you're looking at, but I do feel like our early forays have indicated that there are some areas that might be pretty neglected that are mostly just relevant to global catastrophic biological risks. Like in AI, it feels like there's a lot of work to be done and there's a lot of low hanging fruit to us right now. That's not a very concrete or quantitative answer to the question, I'm more just reporting my sense from looking at this. But I think it would align with what other people who have been doing this, like the folks at FHI, think as&nbsp;well.</p><p><i>Question</i>: It seems like Open Phil is very interested in looking at global catastrophic biological risks. What has the response of the biosecurity community been like with these interests that you guys&nbsp;have?</p><p><i>Claire</i>: Yeah, it's a good question. It would be a better question for Jamie, our program officer in biosecurity who specializes in this and has done a lot more for the grant making. My sense is that a lot of folks have really become interested in it and have been very open. I've definitely seen a lot of an engagement starting to come out of that community. For example, the Center for Health Security had a special issue in their journal Health Security on just global catastrophic biological risks, and a lot of people submitted articles to&nbsp;that.</p><p>I also think there's also a lot of people who are more skeptical, and have an intuition, that I think is very reasonable and comes from a very good place, of being worried that we'll distract from efforts to help people who are really suffering right now. That we have these very speculative concerns that may or may not be justified, may or may not come to anything, and that may conflict with the moral intuition that it's really important to help people who are in need right now. So maybe those people are worried about distracting or diverting money from pressing current issues to work on more speculative&nbsp;goals.</p><p><i>Question</i>: I get the general sense that technical work is more prioritized by the EA community in AI safety, whereas policy or strategy work seems more promising in biosecurity. Do you agree with this, and what do you think is the reason for this distinction if&nbsp;true?</p><p><i>Claire</i>: That doesn't really align with my impression of how at least some people are thinking about AI safety. My sense is that some people think that AI policy and strategy work is actually maybe in higher demand, or the marginal value of a person going into policy might be higher than the value of a marginal person going into AI safety. But I think that would vary a lot depending on who you talk to. For biosecurity, I think that it's really too early to tell. I wouldn't make a statement. Definitely feels like when we make lists of the best seeming projects to us, some of them involve more technical work and some of them involve more policy work. I also feel a little bit uncomfortable with this policy/technical distinction because working on policy can be extremely&nbsp;technical.</p><p>I started it, so it's my bad, but I was more thinking of working on science and engineering versus working on implementing policy or governance strategies. I don't feel like we really have a strong view about which one is more valuable. It just seems like for younger folks who are still figuring out how to start out, it's easier to switch from the science-y to the non science-y rather than vice versa. And so that's sort of a more robust&nbsp;option.</p><p><i>Question</i>: The concept of personal fit seems to come up a lot in EA discussions. Do you have any suggestions or recommendations about how a young motivated EA might test if this field is a good fit for them, or are there reasons why they might be more well suited to working in biosecurity than some other GCR&nbsp;issues?</p><p><i>Claire</i>: Yeah, it's a good question. So first on personal fit, I agree, personal fit is really important. I think people are immensely more productive and more likely to think of good ideas when they're enthusiastic about the area and they find the area interesting. So definitely plus one to that. As to how to kind of test that out, I don't feel like there's an established good way to do it. Doing something like an internship at an organization that works on biosecurity seems like a pretty costly but hopefully effective way to test out fit. Although I could still imagine getting the wrong project and not feeling like it clicks, when maybe if you were given a slightly different project, it would click&nbsp;more.</p><p>For someone who's earlier on and doesn't want to do something that costly, I think going through the resources that are available on global catastrophic biological risks and seeing if they seem interesting to you. Reading through them, and seeing if it feels like you are curious to learn more and you would love to learn more, or it feels like there's an open question and you're like, \"Oh man, it didn't address this issue, but what about this issue? I'd love to figure out that issue.\" That would seem like a pretty positive sign of personal fit to me. But I think that's just like, me theorizing about stuff. That's not like a time tested&nbsp;strategy.</p><p><i>Question</i>: Do you see organizations in the spirit of OpenAI or MIRI starting up in biosecurity anytime soon, and if so, what do you envision them&nbsp;doing?</p><p><i>Claire</i>: So I'm guessing the more generalized question would be like, are there going to be organizations dedicated to global catastrophic biological risks that maybe try to do technical work on reducing the probability of one of those events occurring? And new organizations as opposed to existing organizations that do some work in that space. Although OpenAI also does AI capabilities work. I would say I think there's some prospect that that might happen, but not super short term plans for it to happen. But I think that something like that would be pretty impactful and useful if that happened in the next few&nbsp;years.</p>", "user": {"username": "The Centre for Effective Altruism"}}, {"_id": "gD7wbKaxzJebhp8a4", "title": "Stuart Armstrong: The far future of intelligent life across the universe", "postedAt": "2018-06-08T07:15:00.000Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=haCV1PEeXz4&amp;list=PLwp9xeoX5p8P3cDQwlyN7qsFhC9Ms4L5W&amp;index=23\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/haCV1PEeXz4\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><hr><p><i>The idea of space colonization has captured the human imagination for centuries, but only recently has anyone tried figuring out how it might look in practice.

Extremely inefficiently, hundreds of tons, limited acceleration and the speed of replication is the speed of human reproduction, and&nbsp;maturation.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/36Q0oAytV6S4EW4EimgGGU/da24489b511366e57c8e50560c524510/Future_Life_Slide_13.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/36Q0oAytV6S4EW4EimgGGU/da24489b511366e57c8e50560c524510/Future_Life_Slide_13.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/36Q0oAytV6S4EW4EimgGGU/da24489b511366e57c8e50560c524510/Future_Life_Slide_13.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/36Q0oAytV6S4EW4EimgGGU/da24489b511366e57c8e50560c524510/Future_Life_Slide_13.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/36Q0oAytV6S4EW4EimgGGU/da24489b511366e57c8e50560c524510/Future_Life_Slide_13.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/36Q0oAytV6S4EW4EimgGGU/da24489b511366e57c8e50560c524510/Future_Life_Slide_13.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/36Q0oAytV6S4EW4EimgGGU/da24489b511366e57c8e50560c524510/Future_Life_Slide_13.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>There are some designs for a self-replicating lunar factory.

There's a redundancy of 40 for the high speed. We just need a redundancy of 2 for the low&nbsp;speeds.</p><p>Total energy requirements. We have our sun. We've Dyson'd it. How long does it take to get this amount? Well, for the worst possible scenario, the fusion launch, we need six hours of the sun's energy. To power the launch to every single galaxy we could ever reach at these speeds. And if we go for the 500 ton replicator, it goes up to 11 thousand years. Again, we can use more stars if we want to. We can pause along the way. Do it the old fashioned&nbsp;way.</p><p>But again, on the cosmic scale, these numbers approximate to zero. So what is going to happen if we consider that we can expand so easily, hence aliens can expand so easily. By the way, the initial impetus of this analysis was to make the Fermi Paradox much, much worse. Because we don't need to just worry about why don't we see aliens in our galaxy, but why have they not come here yet? And why have the aliens of nearby galaxies not reached us yet? Especially because the earth is a late-coming planet amongst the earth-like planets. Anyway that's another&nbsp;thing.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3yxZTNzj1SEMaCSCWY0YIU/7bed96cd5f8a43630febfec5fd253707/Future_Life_Slide_24.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3yxZTNzj1SEMaCSCWY0YIU/7bed96cd5f8a43630febfec5fd253707/Future_Life_Slide_24.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3yxZTNzj1SEMaCSCWY0YIU/7bed96cd5f8a43630febfec5fd253707/Future_Life_Slide_24.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3yxZTNzj1SEMaCSCWY0YIU/7bed96cd5f8a43630febfec5fd253707/Future_Life_Slide_24.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3yxZTNzj1SEMaCSCWY0YIU/7bed96cd5f8a43630febfec5fd253707/Future_Life_Slide_24.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3yxZTNzj1SEMaCSCWY0YIU/7bed96cd5f8a43630febfec5fd253707/Future_Life_Slide_24.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3yxZTNzj1SEMaCSCWY0YIU/7bed96cd5f8a43630febfec5fd253707/Future_Life_Slide_24.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>If life is rare, you'll get this: mainly isolated bubbles. If that's the case, then this on the left is where we get to the really far&nbsp;future.</p><p>And on there right, there's the scenario where there's lots of lifes and then we'll encounter them as we expand, and we'll have to negotiate around the frontier. The problem there is external coordination. What do you do when civilizations meet each other? There's attack versus defense, what is the balance when you're in the cosmos? Can you have better technology at this stage? Or is pretty much, are you, at least for warfare, are you pretty much maxed&nbsp;out?</p><p>What about scorched earth? If you say, well if you attack us, we'll destroy our resources, it'll just cost you. You'll gain nothing. There are negotiations, extortions, threats, surrender, there's an interesting dynamic there. It's very hard to predict but these are the considerations that we'll have if there's lots of civilizations that'll encounter each&nbsp;other.</p><p>In the empty scenario, it's a question of internal coordination. How do we stop the different branches of humanity or descendants of humanity from breaking apart? This is the amount of mass that we could eventually reach. This is that mass taken as a mass energy. And this is the number of erasures that we could theoretically do with that amount of&nbsp;energy.</p><p>Now, remember what I said about the very far future? Computing is more efficient when it's cold. If we wait a long, long time. And by a long long time, I mean trillions of years. Don't be so ridiculous, this is, you won't even notice trillions of years that go by. But if we wait a really long time, the only heat that we will get will be from the event horizon of the cosmic expansion of the universe itself. And then the temperature will be extraordinarily low. And then if we take all this energy, and run it, this is the amount of erasures that we can do. The Landauer Limit, or the Bekenstein Bound. One or the other of&nbsp;that.</p><p>Erasures are important 'cause that's the thing that gains entropy. You can't avoid getting entropy when you erase stuff on a computer. So if you have reversible computation, maybe quantum reversible computations, how often do you need to erase? And then that'll give you, by the way, ten to the one hundred and twenty-two is a very large number indeed. I think that's one of the biggest understatements I've every&nbsp;said.</p><p>But this gives you the idea of the amount of computation that you could theoretically run. I say theoretically because we have a problem getting this mass energy. This mass into energy, and then waiting that long. The problem is that proton decay is just too damn&nbsp;fast.</p><p>Proton decay is on the scale of ten to the thirty four years or so. And it seems that the protons will decay before the black holes start evaporating. And that is very annoying 'cause otherwise we could just chuck out all the stuff into the black holes, wait, and harvest the energy as they start evaporating. But this is theoretical&nbsp;maximum.</p><p>The point of this was, nobody had done these computations before me and Anders Sandberg and Bradbury, while he was still alive, did some of them, and we sort of put it together, so you can really put together interesting stuff that is there. And the second thing is, this is really cool and shows the potential massive amounts of value that could exist in the&nbsp;universe.</p><p>And if we can ensure that that's flourishing value, that would be really nice. Thank&nbsp;you.</p><h1>Q&amp;A</h1><p><i>Question</i>: What about aliens? I think you touched on this a bit with the external coordination. So, I'm gonna spin that as like, which of the external coordination problems would you expect to be most&nbsp;challenging?</p><p><i>Stuart</i>: Whether there is a principled way of resolving disagreements or not. So, whether you have to have wars or not basically. But we can talk about that more later. Because that gets&nbsp;esoteric.</p><p><i>Question</i>: Someone wanted to hear your explanation of the difference between using a rocket and a gun for&nbsp;deceleration.</p><p><i>Stuart</i>: When you use a rocket, you have to accelerate or decelerate your fuel that you will then use to continue to decelerate. If you use a gun\u2026 if you're accelerating the bullet by shooting the gun, that's all in one impulse, and you don't get the fuel for the bullet that is accelerated to the same&nbsp;extent.</p><p>You can also, this is probably more realistic, eject your bullet, have it deploy a solar sail and then just paint it with a laser from your gun, and that will avoid the rocket equation as&nbsp;well.</p><p>It's basically, you're just decelerating the payload. If the payload carries the fuel, you have the rocket equation. If the payload does not carry the fuel, and the fuel is stored in the gun or the rest of the thing itself, you can avoid the rocket equation. It's Eric Drexler who came up with that and it took me a long time to convince myself about it, but the equations work&nbsp;out.</p><p><i>Question</i>: Where do you place the greatest probability on a great&nbsp;filter?</p><p><i>Stuart</i>: I put the great filter early, at the very beginning of life, pre-life or at the very beginning of life. If I had to bet, I would bet on, either pre-life or mitochondria kind of thing, or maybe oxygen. But, we can talk about that more in office hours, because there's a lot of interesting other points&nbsp;there.</p><p><i>Question</i>: You said that science fiction often talks about the British colonization model, but you think we might be able to go to every galaxy simultaneously. Is there an assumption then, that you would have enough energy early on in the process to do this&nbsp;simultaneously?</p><p><i>Stuart</i>: Yes. For the small probes, you need six hours of the sun's energy to launch all the probes to all the galaxies. So yes, we have some&nbsp;slack.</p><p>I'll also just mention that we have alternate designs. Maybe we just want to hit a single super cluster, and if we have heavier probes, we can just hit super clusters and radiate out from there. There's other designs that we could do. But we can just blast every galaxy with that kind of&nbsp;energy.</p>", "user": {"username": "The Centre for Effective Altruism"}}, {"_id": "H6KWhEhh7uvADKimh", "title": "Jaan Tallinn: Fireside chat (2018)", "postedAt": "2018-06-08T07:15:00.000Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwsfGYHwpQc&amp;list=PLwp9xeoX5p8P3cDQwlyN7qsFhC9Ms4L5W&amp;index=22\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/xwsfGYHwpQc\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><hr><p><i>Jaan Tallinn has been an effective altruist for many years, and has used his reputation and personal funds to support the study of existential risk.

You had recently wrapped up your involvement with Skype, and you gave a talk at an old Singularity Summit event and you said, \"I find myself in the unusual position of trying to figure out what to do, knowing that I've just wrapped up what is probably going to be the most successful project that I'll ever do.\" That is a unique challenge, but you've really made the most of that opportunity, and have engaged in a lot of really interesting things over the last 8 years that have spanned AI and other existential risks, some work on global coordination, and some interest in a whole bunch of different companies. So, I want to give you the chance to talk about all of that sort of&nbsp;stuff.</p><p>But let's start off with a little bit of a retrospective on the last 8 years since you first got involved. How have things gone from your perspective? How have they deviated from what you thought might&nbsp;happen?</p><p><i>Jaan</i>: I'm not sure I remember how much I thought about what would happen, but yeah, things have gone really well with one exception. A thing that has gone well is that the EA movement has scaled. Probably the most important thing is that the so-called Overton Window - things that are now acceptable to talk about - now firmly includes at least some version of AI safety. You can actually publicly talk about it without being&nbsp;ostracized.</p><p>There are many more people, much more talent, much more resources and much more money available in the existential risk ecosystem in general. Things are really growing really, really nicely. I think the main exception is that we still have a lot of uncertainty about how much time we have. We're making great progress, but it's against an unknown&nbsp;deadline.</p><p><i>Nathan</i>: From the very beginning, you were really worried about the Yudkowsky-style scenario of fast takeoff, or things getting out of control quickly. Have your views on that changed over the last eight&nbsp;years?</p><p><i>Jaan</i>: I mean, a little bit. I guess they have diversified or gotten more uncertain over time as more total people have entered the AI safety space. There are basically more hypotheses, more views about what might happen and what might be important. My general approach is to basically look at when people are making arguments and see whether I can find a bug in them. If I can't find a bug, I just say, \"Okay, here's some probability mass for you.\" People have made more plausible arguments, so I have increased my&nbsp;uncertainty.</p><p>I'm missing the days when it was just one fairly crisp idea of what might go wrong. Recently, I funded a project in Berkeley that is trying to reconciliate different ideas, different hypotheses of how things might develop so we can have a better, hopefully more compact idea of what's going to&nbsp;happen.</p><p><i>Nathan</i>: I think one way you have always stood out is in your epistemic modesty. I mean, here going back to 2010, you're this very successful person, you've had this very visible company that's made a huge impact on the world. But when I first encountered you, you were willing to spend time with anyone who had an interesting idea on AI, and it did not seem to matter to you what credentials they had or didn't have. And also, you've used your own social capital to take the best AI ideas and try to take them to other places where maybe those ideas' authors wouldn't be welcome. So tell us a little bit about your strategy for leveraging your own social capital, but being so humble at the same&nbsp;time.</p><p><i>Jaan</i>: One thing that I sometimes say is that there's really nice benefits that you get from doing programming full-time. One of them is that you get an intuitive sense of what it means to have your thoughts fully specified, and that you can use that ability in other arguments, like are they using just metaphors to conflate things, or are they actually doing something that potentially a machine could&nbsp;understand?</p><p>This has been useful when I want to use it for epistemics. If I wanted to evaluate arguments by a bunch of weird people at the Singularity Institute, that really helped. One thing I think that programming gives you is, indeed, epistemic humility. Because, like programs, you're so confident that you know what's going to happen now, and then you press f5, and nope. Then, you look at it and it's like, \"Yeah, okay. Clearly, I made this mistake.\" You fix it. Nope, that that still wasn't the&nbsp;case.</p><p>So, yeah. It creates epistemic humility. And when I enter a young ecosystem I immediately can look like, \"Okay, so what are things that I could contribute?\" After trying to debug arguments and finding that they seem to be solid. And indeed, I found that - as a side effect of my programming career - I picked up this brand, that I can then use by basically touching the brand and my reputation to arguments that I believe are true, but forw hich people needed some kind of brand to be attached to them to actually take them seriously. That has seemed to work pretty&nbsp;well.</p><p>For example, Huw Price, my co-founder at the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk in Cambridge, wrote this <a href=\"https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/cambridge-cabs-and-copenhagen-my-route-to-existential-risk/\">New York Times piece</a>. In that piece, he explicitly said that the reason why he started taking x-risk seriously, even though he had heard those arguments many times before, was that somebody who really had a reputation of being practical in software actually was taking those ideas&nbsp;seriously.</p><p><i>Nathan</i>: Were there some very early fundamental arguments that persuaded you most, and do those still hold a lot of weight in your mind&nbsp;today?</p><p><i>Jaan</i>: Oh, absolutely. The main realization is the idea of recursive self-improvement. The idea, I think, was initially formulated by I.J. Good in 1965, but I read it from Overcoming Bias when Eliezer Yudkowsky was writing there. He was making this argument in a very clear manner that I bought into, and I still think that it's one possible way of how things could go massively wrong in the world. We could have an accident in an AI lab, where we're pushing meta-learning or whatnot. And suddenly, the meta-learning system starts to meta-learn and you have a system that you can no longer turn&nbsp;off.</p><p><i>Nathan</i>: So how has that seed view evolved? I mean, you've talked about more different ways that things can go wrong, so now, you have a richer view of&nbsp;that.</p><p><i>Jaan</i>: Yeah.</p><p><i>Nathan</i>: So tell us a little bit about the more nuanced view that you have&nbsp;today.</p><p><i>Jaan</i>: One competing theory is that the current deep learning framework might actually take us to the point where we have systems that are roughly on human level or superhuman, but they still cannot understand themselves, that they're still fairly opaque to themselves. In that case, there'd be no immediate danger of fast takeoff in a lab, but you still have a situation where there's global instability because suddenly humans are no longer the smartest planners on this planet, for&nbsp;example.</p><p>So yeah. I think it's a more complicated, messy, less clearly defined scenario, but I do think it's plausible and so I'm assigning some probably mass to&nbsp;that.</p><p><i>Nathan</i>: And you're involved now with a number of different organizations as an adviser, in some cases as a funder. Give us a little sense of your portfolio of activity across the AI space with the different organizations, and sort of strategies that you're involved&nbsp;with.</p><p><i>Jaan</i>: Yeah so, my strategy over the last ten years or so has been to cultivate diversity in the ecosystem. If I see that there are some smart, and what's now called \"aligned\" people, and they want to contribute to existential risk reduction, what I've done is say: \"Okay, here's some seed money.\" And then, if they stay around and start growing and becoming productive, then I have just increased the amount of funding that I support them&nbsp;with.</p><p>Over the 10 years or so, I've been contributing to somewhere between 10 and 20 different organizations and projects in this space and now recently, starting last year, I thought that I should really start scaling up. One half-joking way to say it is that I assign very significant probability to the human economy not surviving the introduction of human-level AI, meaning there is no point in maximizing the amount of money that you have at the point when money becomes&nbsp;meaningless.</p><p>So I need to look at how much time I have to spend this. I mean obviously, again, it's still possible that the human economy or something that resembles the human economy will continue after that, but I don't see why. I might be wrong, which means that indeed I have to scale up my&nbsp;giving.</p><p>So I've been working with BERI - existence.org - with Critch, who is sitting right there and seeing how can we \"institutionalize\" me. Critch put it yesterday in a nicer way, that BERI was originally conceived to help various x-risk institutions. Then, I approached BERI with the thought, \"Okay. Perhaps you can help me.\" Yesterday, Critch was like, \"Oh yeah, Jaan is like an institution, okay.\" I'm&nbsp;qualified.</p><p><i>Nathan</i>: You've put a lot of energy, highly intentionally, into moving the Overton Window, specifically around what kind of thoughts or worries are okay to have. Going back eight to ten years, it was just too weird for anybody who was a respectable, tenured computer science professor, even in the AI space, to have worries about things going wrong. That seems to have shifted in a big way. Where do you see the Overton Window being today, and do you think that work is done? Has it shifted, or is there more to&nbsp;do?</p><p><i>Jaan</i>: There is more to do. It seems to me that Overton Window right now caps out at technological unemployment, so the weirdest thing that you can talk about when it comes to AI, in a \"respectable\" setting, is a societal&nbsp;effect.</p><p><i>Nathan</i>: This is, of course, not a respectable&nbsp;setting.</p><p><i>Jaan</i>: No, it's not. By respectable setting, I mean one where people are mostly concerned about looking respectable and optimizing the opinions of others. I would really like to push the Overton Window higher by promoting the realization that AI might have effect beyond social stuff. So I've been pushing it by saying that AI would be an environmental risk. Because first of all, I think there <i>is</i> an environmental risk eventually. The nice thing about environmental risks is that these are things that unify humans. We are very picky about our environment. Change it by a hundred degrees, which is tiny compared to an astronomical scale, and we go extinct in a matter of minutes. An AI doesn't care about the environment. Why should it preserve the&nbsp;parameters?</p><p>The nice thing about it is that indeed, if there was a realization, \"Oh, wait a minute. We need to control AI in order to not lose the environment\", then this is a much more tangible thing to have a global discussion about, whereas if you just talk about social issues, it's harder. For example, in the Asilomar Principles that we did last year, there is this very contentious principle about human rights, which actually can automatically preclude the Chinese from joining the principles. However, if AI was about long-term environmental effects, there would be no problem of bringing everybody on&nbsp;board.</p><p><i>Nathan</i>: That's fascinating. So you're going around giving a lot of talks on the subject, trying to find the right way to deliver the message so that it can be heard and sp that you seem just the right level of weird. You've mentioned China, and you said you were recently in China and give a series of talks there. So, what's the report from China? Obviously, AI is something that Chinese society is really working&nbsp;on.</p><p><i>Jaan</i>: Yeah, I had a few updates. I mean, one update was that, I mean, I grew up in a totalitarian regime and basically, I knew sort of what to expect, but I hadn't been to mainland China for a decade or two. So one update was that it seems to be a much freer place than the place I remember behind the Iron Curtain. So that was nice, I guess. Then another update was that the AI researchers, at least the ones that I talked to, were very heads-down, optimizing classifiers and robotics doing robotics, things like that. They were proud to say that they were very&nbsp;practical.</p><p>But, on the other hand, there was a really interesting appetite about talking long-term, philosophical manifestations of AI, which was surprising even to the level that I don't see much in the West, or people are more careful about saying in West. So that was interesting. Half-jokingly, I don't know if this is a good idea or not, but I think it might be an interesting idea to have China as the grown-up in the room, because they take real pride in saying that they're an old civilization who thinks long-term as opposed to those silly democratic countries who just think four years at a&nbsp;time.</p><p>There are pros and cons, obviously, to that, but let's just exploit those pros and have them think five or six years into the future and perhaps be a couple of years&nbsp;ahead.</p><p><i>Nathan</i>: I think, maybe, the best piece that I've seen in the American mainstream media about A.I. and the future of society was from a Chinese legal scholar who said, \"With a powerful AI, you might actually be able to have a planned economy that is effective, and you don't necessarily have to rely on market mechanisms, and you don't necessarily have to fall into a scenario where a few people sort of own all the data in society, and we can actually collectivize that and all share the benefits of it.\" Were these things you heard&nbsp;there?</p><p><i>Jaan</i>: I was aware of that. I did a lot of preparation work when I went to China, so I heard those things, but I heard them during the preparation work. But it's funny, actually. I've seen communism fail and the reason why it failed was because people don't like to work. If you have AI doing all the work you don't have that problem for communism at least. You might have other problems, but, at least, this particular, very crucial problem, you&nbsp;eliminate.</p><p><i>Nathan</i>: In terms of your\u2026 we've covered a lot of your personal and reputational efforts to move the window and get people thinking in new ways, and you've also been supporting a lot of organizations. What kinds of organizations are you supporting? Do you think about investing in for-profits, nonprofits, a mix, or do you not care? What kind of organizations are you looking to&nbsp;support?</p><p><i>Jaan</i>: Almost entirely nonprofits. A basic computer science realization is that when you have two optimization targets, then you are not going to be great on either one. So if you want to optimize for the good of the world and for profit, then you have to trade off one of those. I think the maximum effectiveness would be from, yeah, effective altruist organizations or nonprofits that don't have these constraints in&nbsp;profit.</p><p>So interestingly, for example, the same applies to\u2026 Okay, think about if there's a startup, whose business plan is to do a bunch of fundamental physics and then to use those fundamental results from fundamental physics research to gain a commercial advantage, it would just sound silly. However, that is a very typical pitch from AGI companies, that they're going to do this fundamental AI research and then use those results to get a commercial advantage, which almost never works. When you start doing that, you immediately get this tension, and so I think the most successful AI companies. capabilities wise, have been either in academia, or just they're just nicely cordoned off sections of big companies that have lots of cash. So,&nbsp;yeah.</p><p><i>Nathan</i>: How about what's going on in your own home country of Estonia? I mean, I'm hearing more about great companies being built there. Obviously, the Estonian government is known for being a technology leader. Do you think that Estonia has a role to play in this kind of AI future, given its unique position as a digital&nbsp;society?</p><p><i>Jaan</i>: Possibly. If so, then mostly about the near-term issues about how you integrate increasingly sophisticated technology, but I think there's a fairly stark phase change when you go from subhuman systems that are just really smart in certain domains to superhuman systems that might actually do their own technology development. It's not clear that the work that has been spent on the shorter term problems immediately scales. Some of that might scale to the longer term, but it's not&nbsp;obvious.</p><p><i>Nathan</i>: Changing gears a little bit, you've also spoken quite a bit about global coordination as a challenge of interest to you. Just give us a little overview of your interest in that topic and how you think&nbsp;about-</p><p><i>Jaan</i>: Well that will be&nbsp;like-</p><p><i>Nathan</i>: In two minutes.&nbsp;Yeah.</p><p><i>Jaan</i>: That'll be like two&nbsp;hours!</p><p><i>Nathan</i>: Maybe even just pointers to other places where people can go find more would be good as&nbsp;well.</p><p><i>Jaan</i>: Yeah, I mean, I've been thinking about it a little bit over many years now. So it's very diluted thinking about things like upcoming technologies that might make global coordination easier. There are some examples. Like, we're going to get a lot of data about what's happening on the planet and people already are using that to weed out or find bad&nbsp;players.</p><p>For example, in deforestation, it's kind of apparent that it's harder to deforest the planet now than it was before ubiquitous satellites. And blockchain is a particular interest of mine. Turns out, there's a few things that you can do. One way we are putting it is that for last seven, eight years, we have had a regime on the planet where it's possible to globally agree about a piece of data without trusting any central authority to maintain that data. Can we use this interesting property that the world has, to come up with coordination regimes that work in systems where the participants don't necessarily trust each&nbsp;other?</p><p><i>Nathan</i>: Google it for more. There's a lot more out there. How much do leaders of huge tech companies actually talk to each&nbsp;other?</p><p><i>Jaan</i>: I'm not actually&nbsp;sure.</p><p><i>Nathan</i>: Fair.</p><p><i>Jaan</i>: Yeah, I don't&nbsp;know.</p><p><i>Nathan</i>: I always appreciate your willingness to say, \"I don't know.\" What would you advise people to do who are interested in either earning to give to philanthropically support AI safety, or possibly trying to get more involved directly if they can? But let's just start with the money. Where is the best value per dollar right now in&nbsp;AI?</p><p><i>Jaan</i>: I'm not sure if Critch appreciates me saying so, but I think that with the current situation we have in BERI - existence.org - is that, I easily can't give more to them because that would be basically then the fraction that I'm giving to them would be too big proportion. If I could have other people join me, then that actually might be helpful. So that's one thing. But yeah, I think just going to 80,000 hours and following their advice is good. I mean, they have done a lot of thinking about how people can be useful, so I can think anything that I can say is going to be strictly inferior to what they have been&nbsp;saying.</p><p><i>Nathan</i>: How afraid do you find famous people to be about talking about issues that might be perceived as weird, even if they are&nbsp;important?</p><p><i>Jaan</i>: It really depends on what type of reputation they have to protect. If they're politicians, they are obviously really careful about saying things. So actually, my co-founder at the Centre for Study of Existential Risk, Lord Martin Rees, he's a politician and it's fascinating to see how he really cleverly balances the \"craziness\" of the message that he's giving with an optimized perception. So that is&nbsp;interesting.</p><p><i>Nathan</i>: Not sure if this one is right up your alley or not, but what do you think is the main bottleneck to increasing cryonics&nbsp;adoption?</p><p><i>Jaan</i>: Main bottleneck. I might be wrong, but I think the main bottleneck is still that it's not certain that it works. I do have an investment in Nectome, which is competing with cryonics. They're doing destructive brain preservation and they say like, \"Look.\" I mean, they have their bias to say that, but they said, \"Look. If you just look at the scanning they have, after freezing brains, it doesn't seem that there's much information there. But, I mean, I don't have a lot of information, but indeed if there would be much higher confidence that this thing works, then hopefully it would become more of a popular thing to do, but obviously there are many weird social blocks that also need to be&nbsp;overcome.</p><p><i>Nathan</i>: When you say destructive brain preservation is that like slicing and&nbsp;scanning?</p><p><i>Jaan</i>: Yeah, basically what they do. First, they pump you full of cyanide, and other highs, and then like heavy metals to make a brain high contrast. Then, they freeze you, so there's no&nbsp;hope-</p><p><i>Nathan</i>: You're not coming&nbsp;back.</p><p><i>Jaan</i>: You're not coming&nbsp;back.</p><p><i>Nathan</i>: Not in the same&nbsp;form.</p><p><i>Jaan</i>: Yeah, because they preserve the information, not your&nbsp;brain.</p><p><i>Nathan</i>: Beyond AI, which is obviously your number one focus, are there other x-risks that you see rising to near that AI level in terms of&nbsp;urgency?</p><p><i>Jaan</i>: Synthetic bio has always been in a very close race with AI, because it seems much easier to use for destructive purposes. Much cheaper. On the other hand, it has this nice property that we can use intelligence to control it, whereas it's not clear if we can use that in the AI&nbsp;case.</p>", "user": {"username": "The Centre for Effective Altruism"}}, {"_id": "2PFE6iwsrSyfS3PZi", "title": "Neil Buddy Shah: How to unlock more impact", "postedAt": "2018-06-08T07:15:00.000Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OP9XC0aERHc&amp;list=PLwp9xeoX5p8P3cDQwlyN7qsFhC9Ms4L5W&amp;index=21\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/OP9XC0aERHc\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><hr><p><i>In this talk from EA Global 2018: San Francisco, Dr. Neil Buddy Shah makes three arguments about effective altruism: that effective altruists should continue to be rigorous, that we should consider riskier charities than we do, and that we should tailor our interventions at least somewhat to the moral preferences of their beneficiaries.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>A transcript of Buddy's talk is below, including a Q&amp;A with the audience.

But how can we use the same orientation toward rigorous empirical evidence in order to answer the next set of questions and ethical trade-offs facing the EA community? IDinsight works with governments, multilateral foundations, and quite notably with effective altruist partners such as GiveWell and NGOs like the Against Malaria Foundation and New Incentives.

We should really think about how we can leverage the tremendous resources that developing countries' governments are already spending to try and improve the welfare of their citizens, and really use levers such as research and advocacy to unlock a lot more impact beyond just giving to direct service delivery&nbsp;organizations.</p><p>And three, perhaps most substantively, EAs need to think a lot more about the subjective values, preferences, and moral weights of the populations that are actually affected by the programs that are happening in global development. To consider communities in rural East Africa, communities in South Asia, and factor those into their resource allocation decisions. I'd like us to move beyond just our own strict utilitarian definitions of what's the best thing to do with a certain set of&nbsp;resources.</p><h2>We should be&nbsp;rigorous</h2><p>These are the three arguments that I want to make today and to start at the most basic and fundamental level, I think a pretty uncontroversial claim here is that we need to continue to think about rigorous impact evidence in determining how we spend our resources. As a simple example of money spent incorrectly, there was a Millennium Villages Project led by Professor Jeffrey Sachs from Columbia University, which basically tried to lift individuals in Sub-Saharan Africa out of a poverty trap by providing a whole host of goods and services from education, agriculture, and health. And they went around showing a graph like this that, \"Look, over a four year period, we're able to increase household asset ownership fourfold, and based on this we should invest a lot more money in this&nbsp;program.\"</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1USrJyEkNCAo02ACAA60Cu/2aca2d3d9dbe39400631fbcd9ea09523/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_2.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1USrJyEkNCAo02ACAA60Cu/2aca2d3d9dbe39400631fbcd9ea09523/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_2.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1USrJyEkNCAo02ACAA60Cu/2aca2d3d9dbe39400631fbcd9ea09523/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_2.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1USrJyEkNCAo02ACAA60Cu/2aca2d3d9dbe39400631fbcd9ea09523/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_2.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1USrJyEkNCAo02ACAA60Cu/2aca2d3d9dbe39400631fbcd9ea09523/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_2.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1USrJyEkNCAo02ACAA60Cu/2aca2d3d9dbe39400631fbcd9ea09523/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_2.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1USrJyEkNCAo02ACAA60Cu/2aca2d3d9dbe39400631fbcd9ea09523/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_2.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Based on evidence such as this, millions of dollars were raised. But if you take a closer look at the evidence, you see that the same dynamic was there in the rest of the Millennium Villages region, the same in all of rural Kenya, and the same in all of Kenya as a whole. Clearly, there was something happening in Sub-Saharan Africa over this three-year period that was enabling people's lives to get better, that had nothing to do with the Millennium Villages Project. I think this is a cautionary tale that we need to think about evidence in a rigorous way in order to make the right decisions and that if you just look at kind of the easiest most available data you can often make incredibly incorrect decisions. And if you do that, you can end up wasting millions of dollars that otherwise could've gone to improving lives. I think that's kind of a foundational assumption within the EA community, which is important for the rest of the&nbsp;discussion.</p><h2>We should explore riskier&nbsp;interventions</h2><p>The second claim I want to make is that as important as it is to focus on demonstrably improving the lives of the poor, we also need to be a little bit riskier in what we think about as potential top charities. In particular, I want to challenge the EA community to think about things like advocacy and research to improve government spending, as a potential complement to investing in direct service NGOs. I want to do this through a case study of a project that IDinsight did with the Ministry of Health in Zambia, as well as the Clinton Health Access Initiative, and really ask the question, \"Can a randomized trial, research, or advocacy effort be considered a cost-effective charity, if it leverages a lot of government funding?\" The challenge was that the government of Zambia was trying to figure out how to decrease maternal infant mortality, which had very high rates, especially in rural&nbsp;Zambia.</p><p>They had a lot of ideas, but one of the key decisions they wanted to make was, there were a lot of mothers that were delivering at home in unsafe conditions, and they wanted to incentivize them to actually travel to government health facilities, which presumably had better care, in order to deliver their babies. The government was considering a number of different interventions, one of which was, a behavioral nudge to provide a small incentive for mothers. The chosen incentive was, mothers who travelled to the government facility would receive something called a Momma Kit, which is just a $4 kit of a bunch of things that a new mother might want for their kid, to incentivize them to deliver in the facility rather than at home. But there were big questions around if this would be impactful, how cost-effective would it be, and if the government should invest in it in the next fiscal year. They faced constraints. There was no information or evidence on the effectiveness of things like Momma Kits and there was very little budget for the&nbsp;evaluation.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/WPE0ZRrvOg8Ya0wKIoaEU/d78b199c7b2461d053097a5e0a89b7d2/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_3.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/WPE0ZRrvOg8Ya0wKIoaEU/d78b199c7b2461d053097a5e0a89b7d2/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_3.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/WPE0ZRrvOg8Ya0wKIoaEU/d78b199c7b2461d053097a5e0a89b7d2/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_3.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/WPE0ZRrvOg8Ya0wKIoaEU/d78b199c7b2461d053097a5e0a89b7d2/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_3.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/WPE0ZRrvOg8Ya0wKIoaEU/d78b199c7b2461d053097a5e0a89b7d2/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_3.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/WPE0ZRrvOg8Ya0wKIoaEU/d78b199c7b2461d053097a5e0a89b7d2/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_3.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/WPE0ZRrvOg8Ya0wKIoaEU/d78b199c7b2461d053097a5e0a89b7d2/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_3.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>They had to make a decision by the next fiscal year about whether to scale up this program. So we came in and said, \"Okay. What's the theory of change? Momma Kits get distributed at facilities. Then people spread the word about these Momma Kits, which might induce more mothers to deliver in facilities. If mothers are delivering at proper healthcare facilities, then maybe that decreases maternal mortality.\" This last link was well established in the public health literature. People knew that if you deliver in well stocked facilities, you're likely to decrease infant and maternal mortality. However, it was quite uncertain whether just giving away a $4 Momma Kit actually incentivized anyone to come and deliver in the facility. We decided, given that the government needed to make a decision on short notice, that we could design a rapid but rigorous randomized trial that measured whether or not mothers came to deliver in the&nbsp;facilities.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1iAkHEeZxGoSUCueYgMMgk/50d436697bd248a81ed756bd244eac8d/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_4.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1iAkHEeZxGoSUCueYgMMgk/50d436697bd248a81ed756bd244eac8d/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_4.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1iAkHEeZxGoSUCueYgMMgk/50d436697bd248a81ed756bd244eac8d/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_4.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1iAkHEeZxGoSUCueYgMMgk/50d436697bd248a81ed756bd244eac8d/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_4.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1iAkHEeZxGoSUCueYgMMgk/50d436697bd248a81ed756bd244eac8d/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_4.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1iAkHEeZxGoSUCueYgMMgk/50d436697bd248a81ed756bd244eac8d/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_4.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1iAkHEeZxGoSUCueYgMMgk/50d436697bd248a81ed756bd244eac8d/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_4.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>We designed this randomized trial in just five months and using only $70,000. It was a rapid, inexpensive test that could potentially inform a very large-scale government decision that had implications for many mothers and children. What we found after randomizing certain facilities to receive the treatment, and certain facilities to remain as a comparison group, was that these simple $4 Momma Kits actually increased the percentage of women who delivered in a facility by 47%. If you model that out, it roughly translates to around $5,000 per life saved. The important thing to note here is that $5,000 per life saved is not as cost-effective as most of GiveWell's top charities. If you think about this intervention purely from the lens traditionally of effective altruists trying to maximize which interventions get money, you would say that this doesn't really meet the bar. It's pretty good, but there are other sources and interventions that would be a better bang for the&nbsp;buck.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2L1YthNtKw2gcuSO4oOCuy/ee26ecc6c213b02909638db7b83f0b85/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_5.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2L1YthNtKw2gcuSO4oOCuy/ee26ecc6c213b02909638db7b83f0b85/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_5.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2L1YthNtKw2gcuSO4oOCuy/ee26ecc6c213b02909638db7b83f0b85/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_5.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2L1YthNtKw2gcuSO4oOCuy/ee26ecc6c213b02909638db7b83f0b85/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_5.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2L1YthNtKw2gcuSO4oOCuy/ee26ecc6c213b02909638db7b83f0b85/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_5.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2L1YthNtKw2gcuSO4oOCuy/ee26ecc6c213b02909638db7b83f0b85/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_5.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2L1YthNtKw2gcuSO4oOCuy/ee26ecc6c213b02909638db7b83f0b85/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_5.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>However, it's more interesting if you ask the question: Was that $70,000 investment in generating the evidence cost-effective, because it then compelled the government to scale up a program? I think this is a completely different question. We need to start to thinking about inter-mediated causes like this. There are clear benefits when such a small amount of money, whether it's for research or advocacy, has the potential to influence a much larger quantity of government spending. However, from the point of view of an effective altruist that really wants to nail down, \"Is my money demonstrably improving lives?\", there are clear challenges. The first is that attribution is very tenuous. I can stand up here and say that it was IDinsight's randomized trial that led the government to scale up this program, but it's just as conceivable that the government would've scaled it up in the complete absence of&nbsp;evidence.</p><p>Even if our evidence played a role in scaling it up, clearly there are other actors that played a role. The government is delivering the program. There are a lot of other people doing the work. How much of the lives saved can you actually attribute to this evidence? I think this is one of the areas where effective altruists need to be comfortable, or grow more comfortable, with uncertainty. I think it's hard to pin down a clear cost-effectiveness number the same way that you can with anti-malarial bed nets or deworming pills, but the potential leverage that you get from investing in these kinds of things could potentially be outsized, versus direct service delivery. Then if you think about embedding these types of evidence teams within governments to diagnose what's wrong, come up with new ideas, evaluate them rigorously, and scale them up, then there's another opportunity to unlock a lot more bang for your buck in terms of lives saved or lives improved. But you need to be comfortable with a higher degree of uncertainty about whether your is money actually, directly going to improving lives, and what other factors are at&nbsp;play.</p><h2>We should consider the values of&nbsp;beneficiaries</h2><p>Now my third claim, and potentially the most controversial, is that effective altruists need to step outside of their own subjective values, moral weights, and preferences when determining how to do the most good and instate weight more heavily on the preferences, moral weights, and subjective values of populations living in rural Kenya, rural India, and elsewhere in the world, even if those aren't utilitarian world views. I just want to start out by saying very clearly that effective altruists are at the forefront for using evidence and reason to determine how to do the most good. Organizations like GiveWell exemplify this by using randomized control trials, validating those with in-field measurement and a wide range of folks, including The Economist, say that one of the biggest intellectual achievements of the EA movement has been improved charity&nbsp;evaluation.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1Qj3FoRrS80maGwI4IAGWU/b69757c9c1cad391820d447de3bbaddc/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_6.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1Qj3FoRrS80maGwI4IAGWU/b69757c9c1cad391820d447de3bbaddc/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_6.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1Qj3FoRrS80maGwI4IAGWU/b69757c9c1cad391820d447de3bbaddc/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_6.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1Qj3FoRrS80maGwI4IAGWU/b69757c9c1cad391820d447de3bbaddc/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_6.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1Qj3FoRrS80maGwI4IAGWU/b69757c9c1cad391820d447de3bbaddc/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_6.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1Qj3FoRrS80maGwI4IAGWU/b69757c9c1cad391820d447de3bbaddc/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_6.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1Qj3FoRrS80maGwI4IAGWU/b69757c9c1cad391820d447de3bbaddc/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_6.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>However, as evidence and reason-driven as effective altruists are, there's a lot of subjective value that still goes into resource allocation decisions. Even if you identify that AMF is a great cost-effective charity, you're still faced with a subjective trade-off of, \"Should we give a household a direct cash transfer, or save a child's life?\" That's not something that can necessarily be answered clearly using empirical evidence. If we have a set number of resources, should we save younger children versus older adults? Then further afield, if we have a set number of resources, how do we compare an animal's life versus a human's life now, or a human's life now versus a human that might exist in the future? All of these involve moral weights and subjective value judgments. Currently, the approach is basically to rely on EA's own subjective value&nbsp;inputs.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/11oiFjfo8mWEWmoGsAQmCw/f50d89827d00888663af9b8d03558732/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_7.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/11oiFjfo8mWEWmoGsAQmCw/f50d89827d00888663af9b8d03558732/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_7.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/11oiFjfo8mWEWmoGsAQmCw/f50d89827d00888663af9b8d03558732/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_7.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/11oiFjfo8mWEWmoGsAQmCw/f50d89827d00888663af9b8d03558732/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_7.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/11oiFjfo8mWEWmoGsAQmCw/f50d89827d00888663af9b8d03558732/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_7.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/11oiFjfo8mWEWmoGsAQmCw/f50d89827d00888663af9b8d03558732/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_7.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/11oiFjfo8mWEWmoGsAQmCw/f50d89827d00888663af9b8d03558732/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_7.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Here's a graph from GiveWell that basically shows a different GiveWell staff member and how they would value saving the life of a child under five, relative to doubling the consumption of one individual for one year. This is clearly a subjective judgment and there's a wide range. The median is that people value doubling consumption of one individual for one year 50 times. You'd have to do that 50 times in order for it to be equally good to saving the life of a child. There's still a wide degree of variation and it's highly subjective. GiveWell's is a reasonable approach and I don't want to overly criticize it, because it does make sense and we need to make these hard subjective trade-offs, but it's problematic for two reasons. The first is that EAs are WEIRD, and weird in more ways than one. But what I mean in particular is that they're Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and&nbsp;Democratic.</p><p>This means that EA preferences might be very different from the preferences and subjective values of beneficiary populations. And also, that resource allocation is quite sensitive to these subjective preferences. We like to think that we've done all these randomized trials, we know what the cost-effectiveness is, but when you're deciding between GiveDirectly and AMF, there's a lot of subjective input there. We might not be doing the most good possible if we are ignoring the differences, preferences and subjective values of EAs versus beneficiary populations. First, EAs are WEIRD. I want to establish this fact. Joseph Henrich and his coauthors have done a number of experimental psychology and behavioral science experiments that show that WEIRD subjects are particularly unusual compared with the rest of the human species, on all psychology experiments including visual perception, fairness, cooperation, and perhaps most importantly for us, moral&nbsp;reasoning.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5UHp8f6PpmCiagyMWyqWOe/bd0f53b3085c5e00a948f42c4d642b88/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_8.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5UHp8f6PpmCiagyMWyqWOe/bd0f53b3085c5e00a948f42c4d642b88/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_8.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5UHp8f6PpmCiagyMWyqWOe/bd0f53b3085c5e00a948f42c4d642b88/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_8.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5UHp8f6PpmCiagyMWyqWOe/bd0f53b3085c5e00a948f42c4d642b88/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_8.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5UHp8f6PpmCiagyMWyqWOe/bd0f53b3085c5e00a948f42c4d642b88/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_8.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5UHp8f6PpmCiagyMWyqWOe/bd0f53b3085c5e00a948f42c4d642b88/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_8.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5UHp8f6PpmCiagyMWyqWOe/bd0f53b3085c5e00a948f42c4d642b88/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_8.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>People from industrialist societies consistently occupy the extreme end of the human distribution when it comes to moral decisionmaking. This is clearly potentially problematic when trying to determine how to do the most good with a fixed set of resources. Just one example of WEIRD weirdness is the ultimatum game. In the ultimatum game there are two players. One player is the proposer who's given a sum of money by an experimental psychologist and then has to decide how much of that money to give to the receiver, the second player. Now the second player basically can accept that proposal or reject it outright. If they accept it, then both people split the money and if the receiver rejects it, then no one gets anything.

Since Accra, the capital of Ghana, is quite similar, you might say that there's no difference between low income and rich countries. But I think that's more a product that industrialized capitalist urban societies tend to have similar norms, whereas pastoralist or rural agrarian societies can have very different conceptions of moral reasoning, as well as fairness. This has significant implications for the types of trade-offs that EAs are faced with. Now, you could argue that it's fine that there are these different preferences, but in reality cost-effectiveness just comes down to the numbers and it's not that different.

A lot of it comes down to, how do we trade-off between different things. On the Y-axis are a bunch of different GiveWell top charities. The yellow dots are how much better they are than cash, so how many times more cost-effective they are than GiveDirectly. If you just look at the yellow dots, you could say, \"Okay. We have a very clear ordering of what's most cost-effective.\" But as soon as you incorporate the subjective value of how people trade off a dollar today versus a dollar tomorrow, health today versus increased consumption, you see that the picture becomes a lot messier. Another way of showing this is that the Against Malaria Foundation is generally considered around three times as cost-effective as cash, and if you just move one standard deviation down in terms of people's subjective values of increase in consumption versus health, it looks very strong.

A donor has enough money to either save an individual's life or use that money to give $1,000 transfers to a bunch of households.

What we find here is that whether it's saving the life of a 1 year old, 12 year old, or 30 year old, over 60% of respondents say that you should always use the medicine, even if it means spending $10 million on that and you could've given 10,000 households a $1,000 household transfer. Now this is very different from what EAs would do. On average, EAs kind of trade off 15 to 30 households getting a $1,000 cash transfer versus saving the life of a child. This points to why are Kenyans, rural Kenyans so different from what we find in high income country experiments and GiveWell staff. You could just say it's methodological challenges.

I think there's no easy answer, but at the very least we need to grapple with how do we incorporate Kantian or deontological world views if we want to maximize the welfare of those&nbsp;people?</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4zRI2g4eYw0KYSUE2K4kuo/d0dca9fa834cb2ff7a486c3ed298949f/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_14.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4zRI2g4eYw0KYSUE2K4kuo/d0dca9fa834cb2ff7a486c3ed298949f/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_14.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4zRI2g4eYw0KYSUE2K4kuo/d0dca9fa834cb2ff7a486c3ed298949f/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_14.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4zRI2g4eYw0KYSUE2K4kuo/d0dca9fa834cb2ff7a486c3ed298949f/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_14.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4zRI2g4eYw0KYSUE2K4kuo/d0dca9fa834cb2ff7a486c3ed298949f/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_14.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4zRI2g4eYw0KYSUE2K4kuo/d0dca9fa834cb2ff7a486c3ed298949f/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_14.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4zRI2g4eYw0KYSUE2K4kuo/d0dca9fa834cb2ff7a486c3ed298949f/Beyond_Top_Charities_Slide_14.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>You can imagine a scenario in which you weight the beneficiary's preferences with the preferences of a utility maximizing EA in order to come up with some hybrid, or you can make a hard call and say that since we're maximizing the welfare of people in rural Kenya, we're going to go with their world view, even if it's highly deontological and opposed to the utilitarian world view that you might hold as an&nbsp;EA.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/462f0c4254b26e4def98f9dcbda608f8b7d9ff58c593b1c3.png\" srcset=\"https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/462f0c4254b26e4def98f9dcbda608f8b7d9ff58c593b1c3.png/w_160 160w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/462f0c4254b26e4def98f9dcbda608f8b7d9ff58c593b1c3.png/w_320 320w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/462f0c4254b26e4def98f9dcbda608f8b7d9ff58c593b1c3.png/w_480 480w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/462f0c4254b26e4def98f9dcbda608f8b7d9ff58c593b1c3.png/w_640 640w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/462f0c4254b26e4def98f9dcbda608f8b7d9ff58c593b1c3.png/w_800 800w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/462f0c4254b26e4def98f9dcbda608f8b7d9ff58c593b1c3.png/w_960 960w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/462f0c4254b26e4def98f9dcbda608f8b7d9ff58c593b1c3.png/w_1120 1120w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/462f0c4254b26e4def98f9dcbda608f8b7d9ff58c593b1c3.png/w_1280 1280w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/462f0c4254b26e4def98f9dcbda608f8b7d9ff58c593b1c3.png/w_1440 1440w, https://39669.cdn.cke-cs.com/cgyAlfpLFBBiEjoXacnz/images/462f0c4254b26e4def98f9dcbda608f8b7d9ff58c593b1c3.png/w_1530 1530w\"></figure><p>I think that this approach to thinking hard about preferences of communities outside EA is very valuable and important for determining how to do the most good, and that it has implications not just for global development, but also in terms of how we make trade-offs between farm animal welfare, the far future and now. Our current thinking here is very nascent. A lot of these numbers tentative. These are still pilots, but what they do highlight is that there's tremendous scope for us to change our priors on how to do the most good possible, once we start incorporating the actual preferences, subjective values, and moral weights of different populations. I think that this could have tremendous implications for the EA community as a whole and that we need to invest more resources into researching and getting this answer right. Thank&nbsp;you.</p><h1>Q&amp;A</h1><p><i>Question</i>: The first counterargument that might come back to you would be, \"Look, all those people that you cited from the GiveWell or the Open Philanthropy Project, they've thought a lot about this, right? Whereas, you're asking someone in a village setting who probably hasn't had this kind of trade-off put to them before.\" How do you think about that difference, and how much energy and maybe education is behind those&nbsp;answers?</p><p><i>Buddy</i>: I think that's a great point and something that we're trying to think through. Cindy Lee, who's the lead IDinsight economist leading the study, she's been brainstorming other ways to address that. One idea is actually to do a mini-bootcamp, or course in moral reasoning for people living in rural Eastern Kenya to say, \"Okay. These are different ways you can think about these trade-offs\" and then playing the games. I do agree that if someone hasn't thought a lot about these kinds of trade-offs, they might come to conclusions that otherwise they wouldn't. I think there's a lot of work to be done in investigating how do we actually get the right answers and elicit the true preferences of populations, rather than their first gut&nbsp;instinct.</p><p><i>Question</i>: What advice would you give to an undergraduate seeking to pursue a career in development or the alleviation of global&nbsp;poverty?</p><p><i>Buddy</i>: That's a great question. There's the simple rubric, which I think is pretty prevalent among EAs, which is: Where's my marginal impact going to be highest? Thinking about what you are uniquely willing or able to do and hopefully the intersection of those. I think there's no right answer to that. It intersects so much with your particular skillsets, but I think it's generally good to try to find under-invested in problems and then plugging yourself in and doing the things people aren't willing to do. One idea that comes to mind is that, in rural India, for instance, there are state governments that make decisions for 50 hundred million people that are often under-staffed on technical expertise. That's one area, to go to a state that's not sexy, it's not Delhi, it's not Bombay, and really try to help bureaucrats make better decisions when they're&nbsp;under-staffed.</p><p><i>Buddy</i>: If someone is going out to attempt to do good in the world, one view would be that it's really only their own conception of the good that matters and they don't necessarily need to take into account anybody else's point of view, whether a beneficiary or hypothetically someone in a third location. You might say you're going to try to help people in Kenya. You could survey people there. You could also survey people in Norway and arguably neither of those are really relevant to what the actor is trying to accomplish. What's the kind of baseline case that we should take other people's point of view seriously at&nbsp;all?</p><p><i>Buddy</i>: I think a lot of this reduces down to just personal preferences and it's hard to adjudicate what's the right way, at least from my perspective. I think what I would say is, if you're in this room you're probably thinking about how to maximize the welfare of the most people. If you're coming from that perspective, I would generally think of the Rawlsian Veil of Ignorance thought experiment: If I had no idea where in the world I was going to be born, then what kind of system would I want to create? If I didn't know I was a male or female, gay or straight, born in rural Kenya or urban U.S., what's the system that would most maximize my chances of a good life? Then from that vantage point, basically try to make choices. That's at least the way that I think about it, but ultimately there's a degree of arbitrariness in whether you buy into that or not, and whether you try to maximize your own welfare as you exist today, versus some other hypothetical&nbsp;welfare.</p><p><i>Question</i>: Where do you think policy makers today fall on that question? Do you think they buy into the Veil of Ignorance argument or&nbsp;not?</p><p><i>Buddy</i>: I don't think that they do in large part. I think mostly policy makers that we work with are responding to clear sets of incentives around maintaining power. The extent to which they're utility maximizing for their populations, I think depends a lot on the robustness of the civil society and the government, how truly democratic the society is, and they maximizing power within those constraints. I think there's this huge heterogeneity between different types of policy makers based on what the conditions are in that particular&nbsp;society.</p><p><i>Question</i>: Given the kind of emphasis on the recipient's preferences, how much does that lead you to think that just giving cash should be prioritized because then people can obviously use that to realize their own preferences? The person asking the question says, \"Doesn't it, by definition, mean that you should always give cash?\" I can think of a couple caveats, but how do you think about&nbsp;that?</p><p><i>Buddy</i>: Yeah. That's definitely not the conclusion that I come to. I think that there are a lot of public goods that individual consumption decisions always under-invest in. Public health is a great example of that. If you invest in spraying for mosquitoes, that's not something that an individual household can use a cash transfer to do necessarily, because the more households in a village that do that, you might reach a threshold effect that actually dramatically decreases the risk of malaria for the entire village, or the entire community. The big payoffs and gains in utility come from investing in public goods that no single individual could do. Whether that's decreasing pollution, or investing in infectious disease prevention, those are the kinds of investments that are much higher in terms of utility gain than just giving cash to an&nbsp;individual.</p><p><i>Question</i>: Would you and maybe would IDinsight find it valuable to try to do some of the research that you're doing on preferences within the context of developed countries? Somebody's suggesting potentially the New South Wales health system as kind of a model. I don't know anything about that particular health system, but are there kind of advanced models that you can go into and then try to port your learnings to other&nbsp;places?</p><p><i>Buddy</i>: I just don't know enough about that model to really respond,&nbsp;unfortunately.</p><p><i>Question</i>: What were the six other ways that&nbsp;you-</p><p><i>Buddy</i>: The only thing I would say is for issues, like how do you trade off utility gains today for humans versus utility gains in the far future, I think that obviously normative moral reasoning has a lead role to play in social justice causes, like abolitionism, or women's suffrage. You can't just always rely and fall back on individual preferences. However, I think when you're on pretty philosophically shaky ground, it's very useful to at least collect preferences from a wide range of populations in order to better understand what the status quo is and better understand how to ground those philosophical arguments. I think there's a big role in collecting preferences on those types of issues across a wide range of societies. Today, even if they're not determinative, at least they're informative to the kind of moral reasoning that leads to those kind of&nbsp;trade-offs.</p>", "user": {"username": "The Centre for Effective Altruism"}}, {"_id": "8YqmcFzgTCYonHEQg", "title": "Nick Beckstead: Fireside chat (2018)", "postedAt": "2018-06-08T07:15:00.000Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qglMd6XXyx4&amp;list=PLwp9xeoX5p8P3cDQwlyN7qsFhC9Ms4L5W&amp;index=20\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qglMd6XXyx4\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><hr><p><i>In this fireside chat from EA Global 2018: San Francisco, Rob Wiblin asks Nick Beckstead questions about the long-term future, epistemic humility, and which careers effective altruists may not be exploring enough.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>A transcript of their chat is below, which we have lightly edited for&nbsp;readability. You can also watch it on </i><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qglMd6XXyx4&amp;list=PLwp9xeoX5p8P3cDQwlyN7qsFhC9Ms4L5W&amp;index=20\"><i>YouTube</i></a><i> and read it on </i><a href=\"v\"><i>effectivealtruism.org</i></a><i>.</i></p><h1>The Talk</h1><p><i>Rob</i>: How many people heard the podcast interview I did with Beckstead a couple months ago? I'm going to try now to not repeat that, and to push on from some of the topics that we raised&nbsp;there.</p><p><i>Nick</i>: Cool.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: Since 2012, there's been a distinct movement towards focusing on existential risk and long-term future causes. But it's not as if there are many new arguments that we weren't aware of in 2012. We've just become more confident, or we're more willing to make the contrarian bet that thinking about the very long-term future is the most impactful thing to&nbsp;do.</p><p>I'm curious to know whether you think we should have made that switch earlier. Whether we were too averse to doing something that was weird, unconventional, and that other people in general society might not have respected or&nbsp;understood.</p><p><i>Nick</i>: Yeah, that's a good question. I think some things <i>have</i> changed that have made focusing on the long-term future more attractive. But I mostly think we should've gone in more boldly on those issues sooner, and that we had a sufficient case to do&nbsp;so.</p><p>I think the main thing that has changed, with AI in particular, is that the sense of progress in the field has taken off. It's become a bit more tangible for that reason. But mostly, I do agree that we could've gone in earlier. And I regret that. If we had spent money to grow work in that field sooner, I think it would have been better spent than what the Effective Altruist community is likely to spend its last dollars on. I wish the field was larger today. Yeah, so, I think that was a&nbsp;mistake.</p><p>I guess if you try to ask: \"Why did we make that mistake?\" I think you're probably pointing in roughly the right direction. It's uncomfortable to do something super weird. I don't know, though, I guess different people would have different&nbsp;answers.</p><p>I think if I ask myself why I didn't come into this more boldly earlier - I include myself in the group of people who could have - I think there was a sense of: \"Wow, that's pretty crazy. Am I ready for that? What are people going to&nbsp;think?\"</p><p><i>Rob</i>: People came up with all these stories for why working on reducing poverty or helping animals in the standard ways that we've been doing before, were also the best ways to help the long-term future, which struck me as very suspicious arguments at the time. Because they seemed like rationalizations for just not changing anything based on what could be a really crucial&nbsp;consideration.</p><p>Do you think that there's anything that we might be doing like that today? Do you think that they <i>were</i> actually rationalizations? Or were they good considerations that we had to work&nbsp;through?</p><p><i>Nick</i>: I mean I think it's true that a lot of ways we could do good now, including addressing global poverty, I think you could make a case that they have a positive effect on the long-term future. If I was going to guess the sign, that's the sign I would&nbsp;guess.</p><p>I don't think that donating to the usual suspects, AMF and such, would be my leading guess for how to change the long-term character of the future in the best way possible. So, I don't know, I don't want to psychologize other people's reasons for coming up with that&nbsp;view.</p><p>Could we be making other mistakes like that today? I don't see one. I think there's ones you could say maybe we're doing that for. You could make a case like, \"Oh, are we doing that with infinite ethics or something?\" That's not much of a debate about&nbsp;that.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: Seems like it could be another crucial consideration that could really switch things&nbsp;around.</p><p><i>Nick</i>: It could be. I mean, according to me, I would say if I was off doing the thing that was best for infinite ethics, it would look a lot like the stuff I'm doing for global catastrophic&nbsp;risks.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: Isn't that really suspicious? Why is&nbsp;that?</p><p><i>Nick</i>: I don't find it that suspicious. I think that a lot of the stuff on AI and bio-security preparations, when I run the numbers, I think the expected cost per life saved is right up there with the best ways of just helping humans in general. I think AI and bio-security are big deal things in the world, and they're not just big deals if you have an Astronomical Waste&nbsp;worldview.</p><p>So I think they weather a storm from \"help the most humans\" to \"do the best thing for astronomical waste\", It wouldn't be that weird if they were also the best thing for \"infinite good outcomes\". I think it's less tight there. If I were going to explain the argument a little bit more, I would say, \"Well, if there's a way of achieving infinite good, then either it's a scalable process where you want more of it, or it's a process where you just want to get it&nbsp;once.\"</p><p>If it's a scalable process where you want more of it, then it's going to be some physical process that could be discoverable by a completed science. Then the same astronomical waste argument applies to that, because that's where all the possible resources are, is in the distant future. And we'll probably unlock the relevant physical process if we nail that&nbsp;problem.</p><p>And conversely, if it's a thing where you just get it once, I don't have any good candidates available right now for how we're going to achieve infinite value through some esoteric means. My bet would be on a more developed civilization with a completed science finding it. So I want to make sure we get&nbsp;there.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: We could at least tell people about it a bit&nbsp;more.</p><p><i>Nick</i>: We could.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: If it seemed that decisive,&nbsp;yeah.</p><p><i>Nick</i> We could.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: We could have some infinite ethics promotion advocacy group. That'd be pushing the boundaries, I&nbsp;think.</p><p><i>Nick</i>: Yeah.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: Maybe bad for the rest of the&nbsp;movement.</p><p><i>Nick</i>: Over that amount of time as well, there's been a movement among mainstream AI researchers to take alignment issues seriously. But they seem to have been fairly slow to get on board. And even now, it seems like we're making decent progress on concrete technical questions, but it's not as if mainstream AI capabilities researchers are stampeding into joining this&nbsp;effort.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: Why do you think that is? Are there things that we could have done differently? Or could do differently&nbsp;now?</p><p><i>Nick</i>: Yeah. Why is the AI community not doing all the things it could do to take technical safety seriously as a problem? I think that's a difficult question. I think partly it's a matter of time and it's a a matter of timelines and what people believe. How far away they believe powerful AI systems&nbsp;are.</p><p>I think that's a big chunk of it. I also think a big chunk of it is that some of the work involves motivations that are kind of unusual, and are unusual for thinking about with the lens you would have as a machine learning&nbsp;researcher.</p><p>I think, for example, Paul Christiano does a lot of really excellent work on AI alignment as a problem. He blogs about it. A lot of his blog posts are not really shaped like machine learning papers. I think fields tend to get organized around successful methodologies, people who have employed those methodologies successfully and sets of problems that are&nbsp;interesting.</p><p>I think that machine learning is a field that likes empirical results and explaining them. What you did with some code and what the empirical results were. Some issues within AI safety and alignment fit well in that frame, and people do them. Which is&nbsp;great.</p><p>But I also think there are a lot of things that, say, Paul writes about, that don't fit that. I think a lot of the things that you would have to consider to be properly motivated to work on the problem might have a little bit of the character of \"not shaped like a machine learning paper\". I think that makes it hard to move things forward. I think that's a hard problem to think&nbsp;about.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: Yeah. Do you think that's a big mistake that fields are making? If they're so resistant to ideas about their field that come from outside? Is that defensible? Because it helps them avoid nonsense that would otherwise creep&nbsp;in?</p><p><i>Nick</i>: Partly. I might reframe \"resistant to ideas that come from the outside.\" I think fields are organized around a topic, a set of problems, and some methodologies. New methodologies, I think, tend to get accepted when people come in and use a new methodology to do something really impressive that by the standards of the field, or solve some recalcitrant, interesting&nbsp;problem.</p><p>I'm basically expressing a Kuhnian view about the philosophy of science. I think there's a lot to that and it keeps out pseudoscience. I think it helps keep things rigorous, and there's a valuable function to be played there. But I think because some of the approaches to thinking about the motivations behind AI safety as a technical problem, aren't so much shaped like a machine learning paper, I think it does set off people's pseudoscience alarm bells. And I think that makes it harder to move forward in the way that I wish things&nbsp;would.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: Yeah. Seems like this was an issue with concerns about nanotechnology as well. Maybe in the 80s and&nbsp;90s.</p><p><i>Nick</i>: Yes.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: I guess maybe less of an issue with concerns about synthetic biology, it seems like. Maybe there's concerns that come from within the field as&nbsp;well.</p><p><i>Nick</i>: Yeah, I mean, I think the case of nanotechnology is a harder one. I feel less sure what to think about it overall. But I do think insofar as I have looked into that, like Eric Drexler's work on nanosystems, I haven't seen anything that I would call a decisive refutation of that. And I've seen things that were offered as decisive&nbsp;refutations.</p><p>So I think I have pretty reasonable odds that something like that is in principle possible. So I feel uncertain about what to think about the field's view of that, but I do place substantial probability on that being a case of interesting work that was on the turf of another discipline, didn't conform to the reigning methodologies and successfully reasoned its way to a novel conclusion. But not a conclusion that was of substantial interest to the field in the right way, and provable using what they would normally consider the way to do science. To make it become socialized and&nbsp;accepted.</p><p>I do think it's an interesting test for thinking about the sociology of a field, and how fields work with their intellectual&nbsp;norms.</p><p>It's a little weird to talk about whether they're being irrational in this respect, because in some sense, I think these are spontaneous orders that arise. It's not designed by one person. They're kind of hard to change and their fashion plays a big role in fields. I think that's clear to anybody who's been a grad&nbsp;student.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: Do you think if we're interested in changing views within fields in the future, that we should try to pair launching our views with some kind of technical accomplishment? Some engineering result that they might&nbsp;respect?</p><p><i>Nick</i>: Yeah. It's an interesting question. I think it's a hard question ultimately. If you took the strict Kuhnian view and you said, \"Okay, well how do you change the paradigm of the field?\" You have to come in with some revolutionary&nbsp;accomplishment.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: It'd be a long delay, I&nbsp;expect.</p><p><i>Nick</i>: That's a tall&nbsp;order.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: Yeah.</p><p><i>Nick</i>: I think you can do things that are interesting by the standards of the field and also are interesting for your own unusual motivation. And that is also a route to legitimizing a&nbsp;topic.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: Rhat career options that are very promising do you think EAs are neglecting to take&nbsp;sufficiently?</p><p>I wouldn't say this is underrated by the EA community right now, but it is striking to me that we still don't have that many people from our community who are, say, working on technical AI safety at OpenAI or DeepMind. We don't have that many people from our community who are working as policy advisers at those&nbsp;organizations.</p><p>If you're trying to be prepared for a world in which transformative AGI might be developed over the next 15 or 20 years, then that's an unfortunate oversight. I think those roles are hard to get, so it's understandable. But I think we should be making a strong effort for&nbsp;that.</p><p>I think roles as research engineers working on AI safety would also be pretty valuable. I think those might not require going and getting a PhD in machine learning. I think that's something that a really good software engineer could think about retooling for and could successfully end up doing. And could have a really big&nbsp;impact.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: You were telling me about someone who recently managed to get into OpenAI, right? As a software developer? Or they were a software developer and then within a couple of months of training, they managed to get a job there as an&nbsp;engineer?</p><p><i>Nick</i>: Right, yeah.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: Yeah.</p><p><i>Nick</i>: So I think there's more room for that kind of&nbsp;thing.</p><p>Jason Matheny's career is very striking to me. This is somebody who's been a part of the Effective Altruism community. Who's now the director of IARPA, and has had I think some pretty interesting impacts supporting the Good Judgment Project, and the competition around forecasting in the intelligence community, which I think has developed some really useful techniques that could be more widely applied in&nbsp;society.</p><p>I saw the other day, something in the news talking about a set of questions that is now asked whenever new projects are funded out of IARPA. They include, \"What will the effects be if we're working on this and another country acquires this technology? How long will it take? And what will the effects be? And can we prepare defensive countermeasures?\" It was a new set of questions that was asked of everything that they're funding, because that was one of his ideas and it was a great&nbsp;idea.</p><p>I'm struck by the fact that we don't have more people looking for opportunities like that in the US government. I think we could. I would love it if more people in our community tried to get roles as program managers at IARPA or DARPA and tried to fund some awesome and relevant science along the way, and also develop their networks and be in a place where they could play an important role, if some of the transformative technologies that we're interested in start getting closer to having a big impact on the&nbsp;world.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: What's the deal with Matheny? He was an EA in the early 2000s, long before we came up with the name. Then he's set on this path and has been enormously&nbsp;successful.</p><p>Is it just a selection effect that the people who get involved in a new set of ideas very early on tend to be extremely driven? Or has he just gotten very lucky maybe? Or we're lucky to have someone so&nbsp;talented?</p><p><i>Nick</i>: Yeah. I'm not&nbsp;sure.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: Maybe it's easier than we&nbsp;think.</p><p><i>Nick</i>: I'm not sure what the answer to that is. A story that I'm just making up right now would be well, there's a lot of things that I think are better explained now. If you were figuring everything out back then and you managed to get to a lot of the crucial considerations on your own, that's a stronger&nbsp;filter.</p><p>I could imagine other social considerations and stuff like that. Ultimately I think the interesting thing is, hey, maybe we could try some more of this&nbsp;strategy.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: Yeah. Makes&nbsp;sense.</p><p><i>Nick</i>: I'm also struck by\u2026 I mentioned Tetlock just a moment ago. I'm stuck by the fact that we don't have more people going and being PhD students with&nbsp;Tetlock.</p><p>I think learning that methodology and deploying it somewhere else, maybe in the government, maybe at an org like Open Philanthropy or something like that, seems like a promising route for somebody to&nbsp;take.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: Do you worry that improving decision-making stuff is just too&nbsp;indirect?</p><p><i>Nick</i>: I mean, you could make that case. But I think you can apply it relatively directly. Suppose you had a view like, \"Well, look, what I really care about is AI and bio-security preparedness.\" You could just take the methodology and apply it to AI and bio-security relevant forecasting. I think that would be pretty valuable for the specific cause in&nbsp;question.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: Yeah. It's really annoying no one's done that. I just want to get, like, forecasting numbers. If anyone's listening and wants to: do&nbsp;that.</p><p>So all those paths are pretty competitive and the EA community sometimes accused of being&nbsp;elitist.</p><p><i>Nick</i>: Yeah.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: Do you think we are elitist? If so, is it a mistake or&nbsp;not?</p><p><i>Nick</i>: I mean, what is elitism, maybe? We'll need to define our terms&nbsp;first.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: I guess that would be partly my question. Why would someone make that critique? I think, if you see a bunch of people talking about charity and they're talking about these kind of \"out there\" ideas, very intellectual\u2026 I think we used to be a little bit unnecessarily combative about other approaches to doing&nbsp;good.</p><p><i>Nick</i>: I think that might be part of the cause of why somebody might look at what we're doing and say it's elitist. Also I think it's partly self reinforcing. So you have a community that has grown up to a significant degree in Oxford and San Francisco and&nbsp;Berkeley.</p><p>So there's a bit of a founder effect, and we tend to cater to the people who pay attention to us. So you end up with a lot of people who have technical backgrounds, went to really good schools, and were thinking about the problems that we can best&nbsp;solve.</p><p>I think when I look at all the problems that we're most interested in, the paths to impact often do look research driven, egghead-y, technocratic. So I think we shouldn't change our cause selection or views about what is a good solution in response to what is ultimately a social criticism about being&nbsp;elitist.</p><p>But I do think\u2026 do we have something to learn about how we're talking about what we're doing and taking an attitude of humility towards that? I think&nbsp;maybe.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: Yeah. 'Cause one way that we could've ended up or we could end up focusing on these exclusive positions mistakenly would be if our question is: how can one person have the biggest impact? So we look for very difficult roles where that person's incredibly influential. Then we look at causes where one person can have a lot of&nbsp;impact.</p><p>But then as a result, we can't really achieve very much scale, 'cause there's only a small fraction of people who are ever qualified to take those roles. If we'd said, what are roles that, as a whole, given the number of people who are gonna end up taking them, would have the largest social&nbsp;impact?</p><p>Then you might say, \"Well, here's a position where there's like a million different roles.\" Or something like there's a million different\u2026 there's a huge room for more talent,&nbsp;basically.</p><p><i>Nick</i>: Yeah.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: And although each person is less useful, as a whole they'll have a larger&nbsp;impact.</p><p><i>Nick</i>: Yeah. I think it's a legit question. I think your answer to that question might depend on your cause selection, to some degree. This interview, and my personal priorities, are focused more heavily on global catastrophic risks. I think it's harder to think of something that takes a much larger number of people as an input and helps a lot with the future of artificial&nbsp;intelligence.</p><p>I think less about some of these other areas. I think it would be in some ways a more interesting question that somebody else might be able to answer better. Like, if we were doing something at huge scale with global&nbsp;poverty.</p><p>If you had a Teach for America of global poverty or something, meaning a thing that takes on huge numbers of college graduates and places them in a role where they're doing something effective about the problem, has huge room for more talent. That's an interesting idea. I haven't really thought it through. Maybe there's something&nbsp;there.</p><p>Similarly, could you do something with that in animal welfare? I don't know the answer and I would sort of defer to somebody who's more involved in that space. But I think for AI and bio-security, I think that smaller community, technocratic, more artisanal job spec, is the place that it seems like it makes the most sense to be&nbsp;looking.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: Yeah. One reason that you don't want tons of people in those fields and it's quite artisanal, is that there's a pretty high risk of people who are somewhat amateurish causing&nbsp;harm.</p><p><i>Nick</i>: I think that's very&nbsp;true.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: Yeah. Do you think that we're sufficiently worried about people causing harm in their career? I mean 80,000 Hours, perhaps should we be advising more or fewer people to go into those&nbsp;fields?</p><p><i>Nick</i>: I don't know. 80,000 Hours seems like roughly in the right place on that to me. I think there's some subtlety to projects we take on in the Effective Altruism community. There's a way you can evaluate your project that makes it perhaps a little too easy to make it seem like you're doing&nbsp;well.</p><p>Which would be like, \"Well, this is our staff. This is our budget. This is the number of people we helped.\" And say, \"Well, if we value our time at X and blah, blah, blah, blah, then the return on investment is&nbsp;good.\"</p><p>I think many things do take up a slot in the sense that, \"Well, there's probably only gonna be one EA community organizer in this city.\" Or maybe EA community organizing group in the city. Or maybe there's only gonna be one EA career adviser group. Something like&nbsp;that.</p><p>We should be mindful of who else might've been in that slot, and what their impact would be. That can be a way to make it easier than it would seem to have negative impact by doing something that seems pretty&nbsp;good.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: Because you can displace something that would've been better that you never&nbsp;perceive.</p><p><i>Nick</i>: Yeah.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: Yeah. Interesting. I'm curious to know what you think about the debate that was happening earlier this year around epistemic&nbsp;humility.</p><p>You wrote this quite popular post on LessWrong around five years ago, where you staked out a pretty strong view on epistemic humility in favor of taking the outside&nbsp;view.</p><p><i>Nick</i>: Right.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: And not taking your own personal intuitions that&nbsp;seriously.</p><p><i>Nick</i>: Yeah.</p><p><i>Rob</i>: It seems that there's been some controversy about that. People pushing back, saying that it doesn't generalize very well. What do you&nbsp;reckon?</p><p><i>Nick</i>: I mean the motivation for that view is like\u2026 in philosophy they have conciliatory views about peer disagreement. Where if there's a disagreement, in some sense your view should be an impartial combination of the views of other people who take that view seriously. Or have thought about that, and maybe some weighting based on how likely you are to be right versus them in disagreements of this&nbsp;kind.</p><p>That post was kind of like the macro consequences of, if you took that seriously, what would that imply? Another framing that motivates it would be, \"Well, we could think of all of us as thermometers of truth, in some sense.\" You throw questions at us and we get a belief about them. We don't totally know how good our thermometers are. I have one and you have one and everybody else has one. We're like, \"What should we do when these thermometers give us different&nbsp;answers?\"</p><p>The view I defended was kind of like, \"Yeah, you should be some impartial combination of the output of what you think the other thermometers would've said about this question.\" Where you're weighting by factors that you would think would indicate reliability. I think I basically still hold&nbsp;that.</p><p>But there was a secondary recommendation in that post that was like, \"Why don't you test how well you're doing, by explaining your view to other people and seeing how much of it they buy?\" If you're only getting like some weird niche of people to agree with you, then maybe you should think twice about whether you're on the right&nbsp;track.</p><p>In some sense, I think that's still a useful activity. But I think these cases where you can only convince some weird niche of people that you're on the right track, but you're still right, are more common than I used to think. I think some of the remarks I made earlier about the structure of intellectual fields is an input to my views about how that can&nbsp;happen.</p><p>I guess I think I'm walking back from that test being very decisive about how likely it is that you're on the right track. I don't know. Eliezer Yudkowsky wrote a nice book about this. I think there's a part of that that I really agree with which is that you might not be able to know, it might be very hard to tell who's being&nbsp;irrational.</p><p>Somebody else might have some arguments that you can't really follow and they might in fact be right, even if you meet up and talk about whether that's the case. And for all the world, it seems like one of them is more&nbsp;reasonable.</p><p>So I don't think I have a lot of super practical advice, but I do feel like it's possible to go too far in that direction. Another thought on that it may also be important for personal development to not be too overly modest about developing your own opinions about how things&nbsp;work.</p><p>I think if you don't develop your own opinions about how things work and see them tested and refined and figure out how much to trust yourself, then it becomes hard to do things that are important and innovative and be one of the first ones to arrive at an important&nbsp;insight.</p><p>I said something about that in that post, but I think if I was writing it again today, I would emphasize it&nbsp;more.</p>", "user": {"username": "The Centre for Effective Altruism"}}, {"_id": "6cyXwsAanTmhvZRRH", "title": "Seth Baum: Reconciling international security", "postedAt": "2018-06-08T07:15:00.000Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=514k_8qoVn0&amp;list=PLwp9xeoX5p8P3cDQwlyN7qsFhC9Ms4L5W&amp;index=17\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/514k_8qoVn0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><hr><p><i>Many effective altruists prioritize reducing existential risks.

We can't just think about what sorts of actions we would ideally like to see on these issues. We need to see what people could actually do in their&nbsp;positions.</p><p>In order to do this we need to understand their perspectives, how they think. They don't necessarily think like we do. They don't have the same beliefs, the same values necessarily, and even if they did, based on where they work, the institutional context, they might not be able to take certain types of actions. We really would do well to internalize that and adjust our own strategies&nbsp;accordingly.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2JMeL2q23usyW4kgceAeQE/44d927188d26f5156013279511bbdf63/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__1_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2JMeL2q23usyW4kgceAeQE/44d927188d26f5156013279511bbdf63/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__1_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2JMeL2q23usyW4kgceAeQE/44d927188d26f5156013279511bbdf63/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__1_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2JMeL2q23usyW4kgceAeQE/44d927188d26f5156013279511bbdf63/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__1_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2JMeL2q23usyW4kgceAeQE/44d927188d26f5156013279511bbdf63/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__1_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2JMeL2q23usyW4kgceAeQE/44d927188d26f5156013279511bbdf63/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__1_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2JMeL2q23usyW4kgceAeQE/44d927188d26f5156013279511bbdf63/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__1_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>A good place to start is in understanding how they think and talk about these sorts of ideas. So in international security, for example, specifically in intelligence analysis, they have a concept called \"mirror imaging\" or \"mirroring\". Mirroring is the mistake that analysts often make when they assume that the people who they are analyzing think and act like they do. It's essentially like \"If I was in that position, this is what I would do\". Well, you're not in that position: it's someone else and in intelligence analysis, it's typically somebody from a different country, with a different cultural and political background and a different institutional context that they work in. It's a mistake to think that they would do what you would do in that circumstance. Avoiding mirroring works well for the intelligence community, and it's also an important message for&nbsp;us.</p><p>A pretty classic example of this, in global catastrophic risk, from the early 1980s and the early studies of nuclear winter, is Carl Sagan and colleagues. They were really concerned about nuclear winter for essentially the same reasons that we might be concerned about global catastrophic risk and existential risk, and things like that, which is because a nuclear winter would be a very severe event, potentially including loss of future generations. They were concerned about this and concluded that therefore, we should reduce the size of nuclear arsenals down to a level that would be too small to cause nuclear&nbsp;winter.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Sf5l3WmisAUswcGCocGUQ/8ebf9f65e74a4ad03ab9ee6d6cc03c52/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__2_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Sf5l3WmisAUswcGCocGUQ/8ebf9f65e74a4ad03ab9ee6d6cc03c52/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__2_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Sf5l3WmisAUswcGCocGUQ/8ebf9f65e74a4ad03ab9ee6d6cc03c52/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__2_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Sf5l3WmisAUswcGCocGUQ/8ebf9f65e74a4ad03ab9ee6d6cc03c52/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__2_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Sf5l3WmisAUswcGCocGUQ/8ebf9f65e74a4ad03ab9ee6d6cc03c52/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__2_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Sf5l3WmisAUswcGCocGUQ/8ebf9f65e74a4ad03ab9ee6d6cc03c52/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__2_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Sf5l3WmisAUswcGCocGUQ/8ebf9f65e74a4ad03ab9ee6d6cc03c52/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__2_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>They tried promoting this idea in international security policy circles and met with the response that no, actually, to the extent that nuclear winter was a concern, it was a concern that only reinforced our existing nuclear weapons policy; it didn't suggest any changes. The policy was based on nuclear deterrence: the idea that nuclear war would be so catastrophic that the only sensible policy was to avoid war in the first place. Nuclear winter just makes nuclear war even more catastrophic than it already was, reinforcing the deterrence policy. This is really where the debate over nuclear winter ended. It was a stalemate, didn't really get much farther, didn't change the actual nuclear weapons policy that we had. It was because they didn't really reconcile with this reaction from the nuclear weapons policy&nbsp;community.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3Ufr4iGDNm20cEGgo26eg0/5f2783af72e3ad29b73ecb00d465373e/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__3_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3Ufr4iGDNm20cEGgo26eg0/5f2783af72e3ad29b73ecb00d465373e/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__3_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3Ufr4iGDNm20cEGgo26eg0/5f2783af72e3ad29b73ecb00d465373e/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__3_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3Ufr4iGDNm20cEGgo26eg0/5f2783af72e3ad29b73ecb00d465373e/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__3_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3Ufr4iGDNm20cEGgo26eg0/5f2783af72e3ad29b73ecb00d465373e/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__3_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3Ufr4iGDNm20cEGgo26eg0/5f2783af72e3ad29b73ecb00d465373e/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__3_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3Ufr4iGDNm20cEGgo26eg0/5f2783af72e3ad29b73ecb00d465373e/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__3_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>For a more recent example, in a high profile video on lethal autonomous weapons, the term \"slaughterbots\" was put out recently, and you can agree or disagree with what the video itself was actually saying. I personally am somewhat skeptical, but it's still the case that the video was fairly poorly received by a lot of important people in international security policy communities, and because of that it has made it more difficult for the people behind the video to get their message out there to these very important&nbsp;audiences.</p><p>Then finally, an example with my own work, because I am not above making this mistake myself. A few years back I published some research on a concept I called \"winter-safe deterrence\". Now this was actually an attempt to reconcile concerns about the risk of nuclear winter with the belief in nuclear deterrence as a policy construct, and I said, \"Okay, if we are going to reduce our nuclear arsenals down to a level that would not cause nuclear winter, are there other things we can do using other types of weapons to achieve a successful deterrence policy, so that we can have the best of both worlds?\" For this, I looked at a number of different types of weapons, including biological weapons, and it was the attention to biological weapons in this research that prompted these responses that you see here.

Might even be larger than what's shown here, in that they just think that the weapon itself as a class of weapon should not be there. This is why we see bans of a number of different types of weapons: biological weapons, chemical weapons, land mines, and several others. Okay, some of that I disagree with. Part of the argument that is made for banning weapons is, in ethics terms,&nbsp;deontological.</p><p>They will argue that certain types of weapons are fundamentally immoral. Personally I disagree with that. Like if I'm going to be killed in the battlefield I don't actually care what type of weapon it is that kills me, I'm dead anyway. Likewise, if I'm going to be hurt, I don't care which type of weapon it is that hurts me, I care about the pain that I have to suffer. But at the same time there are a lot of people who think deontologically about weapon types, and that's something that I need to internalize and factor&nbsp;in.</p><p>But there's more to it than that. Banning a class of weapons is just a simpler approach to policy. I mean, \"ban biological weapons\" - that's three words. You could put it on a bumper sticker, versus like \"craft a carefully optimized small quantity of biological weapons to be used in specific circumstances.\" That's a lot more complicated, it's harder to rally political support behind it and in consequentialist terms that matters, and so this is something that I have been, since this, trying to grapple with and internalize, and factor into my own approach to weapons&nbsp;policy.</p><p>Now there are still some parts of it where I really do think the international security community gets it wrong. In particular in the last few years with the really massive international attention paid to a fairly small handful of chemical weapons attacks in Syria, in comparison to the much larger number of attacks using guns and conventional explosives. Conventional weapons that just aren't quite as salient, for whatever reason. This seems wrong to me. Where we make such a big deal out of the people who are hurt and killed by chemical weapons, but for this much larger number of people who just have the misfortune of being hurt and killed by the wrong weapons, we don't actually care about that so&nbsp;much.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4UsCOSYu1Wq0GMyMOOa0iW/1a1d5edab58bac39b5dfe6758f1694bc/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__7_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4UsCOSYu1Wq0GMyMOOa0iW/1a1d5edab58bac39b5dfe6758f1694bc/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__7_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4UsCOSYu1Wq0GMyMOOa0iW/1a1d5edab58bac39b5dfe6758f1694bc/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__7_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4UsCOSYu1Wq0GMyMOOa0iW/1a1d5edab58bac39b5dfe6758f1694bc/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__7_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4UsCOSYu1Wq0GMyMOOa0iW/1a1d5edab58bac39b5dfe6758f1694bc/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__7_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4UsCOSYu1Wq0GMyMOOa0iW/1a1d5edab58bac39b5dfe6758f1694bc/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__7_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4UsCOSYu1Wq0GMyMOOa0iW/1a1d5edab58bac39b5dfe6758f1694bc/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__7_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>There are some people who do care about it, like this organization Action on Armed Violence.

I mean, I'm actually myself thinking of getting involved in this, to really help drive home the point that there are all these lives that are being harmed and killed on something that we're essentially neglecting.

Okay, sure, you can cause a lot of harm with chemical weapons, but aside from World War I trench warfare, 100 years ago, for the most part that hasn't really been the&nbsp;case.</p><p>Now with respect to nuclear weapons we should be careful in talking about the international security community perspective, because there's not just one perspective.

These are people who really believe in nuclear deterrence, and there is a certain logic to&nbsp;this.</p><p>If nuclear deterrence brings peace, peace is good, so we should spread nuclear weapons around to more countries, so that they can have peace. I might not believe in the effectiveness of nuclear deterrence quite as much as they do, but there is at least a logic to it. That is a small minority, though. A more common view among the hawkish folks are to essentially maintain the status quo. We will keep our weapons because we see benefits from them, but we don't want another countries to have them, especially the other countries that we don't trust so&nbsp;much.</p><p>Another prominent view is to have gradual disarmament on timescales of decades or so, as international conditions permit. This is like Obama, people with similar views as him, the NGO Global Zero is big in this space. And then finally another very prominent view is for a much more rapid nuclear disarmament. ICAN is the International Coalition for the Abolition of Nuclear Weapons. They just won the Nobel Peace Prize for this. And NWS, Non-Nuclear Weapons States, the countries that don't have the nuclear weapons, quite a lot of them also support this view on nuclear&nbsp;disarmament.</p><p>Now I've been studying the risk of nuclear war for many years now. And I've got to be honest, I'm actually not sure which of these camps I support. It's tricky because okay, nuclear weapons obviously make war more severe. That much is pretty clear, but with nuclear deterrence they have some potential to reduce the frequency of major war, such that if you switched over to conventional deterrence it's possible that you would have major wars that occur more&nbsp;frequently.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/25yi5tYctGyCeQ4ICcuEca/4bc0792e1c4f70a12a59486aa59da859/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__10_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/25yi5tYctGyCeQ4ICcuEca/4bc0792e1c4f70a12a59486aa59da859/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__10_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/25yi5tYctGyCeQ4ICcuEca/4bc0792e1c4f70a12a59486aa59da859/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__10_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/25yi5tYctGyCeQ4ICcuEca/4bc0792e1c4f70a12a59486aa59da859/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__10_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/25yi5tYctGyCeQ4ICcuEca/4bc0792e1c4f70a12a59486aa59da859/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__10_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/25yi5tYctGyCeQ4ICcuEca/4bc0792e1c4f70a12a59486aa59da859/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__10_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/25yi5tYctGyCeQ4ICcuEca/4bc0792e1c4f70a12a59486aa59da859/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__10_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>And so you have this tradeoff between the frequency and severity of war. And it's actually not really obvious to me how that tradeoff is resolved. And so because of that, I have tended to shy away from advocating specific policy positions on nuclear disarmament - it's not quite clear which policy position we should be pushing for. Instead, at least a few years ago, what I would do is push for a different type of policy, which is to improve relations between the different countries, especially the nuclear weapons countries that don't get along with each other, starting with the United States and Russia, which have the two major nuclear&nbsp;arsenals.</p><p>This is something that would clearly reduce the risk of all types of war, and it's something that people across all the different disarmament camps would agree with. Everybody agrees that if countries get along with each other better, they're less likely to have wars. And that makes the world safer.

Martin Hellman, a professor at Stanford, did early work on cryptography, and then some work on the risk of nuclear war, that my own risk analysis is built off of. In a really amazing project, the two of them analyzed their own marriage, and what they did to overcome their marital struggles, and used that as a starting point for thinking about how to improve relationships between different countries around the world. Really brilliant&nbsp;concept.</p><p>And this is the sort of thing that I would point to as having good potential to make progress on this front. However, within the last year or two, things have changed. We now have, as I'm sure you're all aware, a fairly different political environment, such that if you are to talk about trying to improve the relationship between the United States and Russia, right now it's more complicated. I think that's a fair way of putting&nbsp;it.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7aSwOsnN04E2MKSiWimw8O/41b288c466aa52bfffe12de49b7b8552/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__12_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7aSwOsnN04E2MKSiWimw8O/41b288c466aa52bfffe12de49b7b8552/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__12_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7aSwOsnN04E2MKSiWimw8O/41b288c466aa52bfffe12de49b7b8552/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__12_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7aSwOsnN04E2MKSiWimw8O/41b288c466aa52bfffe12de49b7b8552/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__12_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7aSwOsnN04E2MKSiWimw8O/41b288c466aa52bfffe12de49b7b8552/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__12_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7aSwOsnN04E2MKSiWimw8O/41b288c466aa52bfffe12de49b7b8552/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__12_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7aSwOsnN04E2MKSiWimw8O/41b288c466aa52bfffe12de49b7b8552/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__12_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>And in this political environment, I actually don't have great ideas. I don't know what the best way forward, because so many of the issues now are within the space of domestic politics, especially within the US. That's really kind of emerged as a big thing. It used to be that there as a lot of consensus within the US about say, how to approach the relationship with Russia, now it's just gotten a lot more complicated. And the important actors for domestic politics are not technical policy analysts like myself, it's more like journalists or grassroots political organizers, campaign managers, of course the politicians&nbsp;themselves.</p><p>And so I have not felt like I've had really good opportunities to make a positive difference on this front. My own strategy has actually mostly been to lay low, do some research and some quiet networking with policy communities and sharing ideas with them. Which doesn't get to the root issues going on but is still something I feel like we can make constructive progress&nbsp;on.</p><p>What is clear though, is for those of us working on international security issues, we need to understand this and internalize this and factor it into our plans and our strategies because this really matters. And who knows how this story is gonna play out? It's too soon to&nbsp;tell.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/400yZjzM5i00AMaKAu4Ok0/ad6d350b51e2a83afd3a093f0ffe8065/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__13_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/400yZjzM5i00AMaKAu4Ok0/ad6d350b51e2a83afd3a093f0ffe8065/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__13_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/400yZjzM5i00AMaKAu4Ok0/ad6d350b51e2a83afd3a093f0ffe8065/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__13_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/400yZjzM5i00AMaKAu4Ok0/ad6d350b51e2a83afd3a093f0ffe8065/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__13_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/400yZjzM5i00AMaKAu4Ok0/ad6d350b51e2a83afd3a093f0ffe8065/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__13_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/400yZjzM5i00AMaKAu4Ok0/ad6d350b51e2a83afd3a093f0ffe8065/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__13_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/400yZjzM5i00AMaKAu4Ok0/ad6d350b51e2a83afd3a093f0ffe8065/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__13_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>And that goes for nuclear weapons, and a lot of other issues. As of recently, those issues include artificial intelligence.

Not the more dramatic transformative AI that we could have in the future. However, shown here this is a map from a survey of artificial general intelligence projects that I've published last year. And what you see is they're all over the world. And maybe half of them are based in the United States, but there's a lot in Europe, a lot in China, a few in Russia and other countries around the world. Now most of these are private, they're either at private companies or in academia, but some of them have government ties and the governments that the countries that these projects are based in, may be paying attention to them anyway. I think we will expect to see more and more of that as this field progresses. And so for this as well, it's important for us to understand these international security dynamics, and also the perspectives of the people who are taking relevant actions on that. If we do understand their perspectives, we can customize our own efforts on these issues&nbsp;accordingly.</p><h1>Q&amp;A</h1><p><i>Question</i>: What does it take to create a nuclear winter, what is that threshold? There's thousands and thousands of these missiles, how many have to go&nbsp;off?</p><p><i>Seth</i>: That's a good question because if you have just one nuclear weapon it's probably not going to cause anything close to a nuclear winter. We had two used in WWII; that didn't really change things that&nbsp;much.</p><p>What I did in my survey was to take a cautious approach. Which is to say that well, we don't know exactly what it would take, let's err on the safe side, aim low for it. And so the number that I proposed in this study was 50. This was based on other research that had studied nuclear war scenarios involving 100 nuclear weapons and they found substantial effect. And so I thought, okay, let's take a number that's lower than that, but I have to say that this 50 number was somewhat arbitrary. It's not something that we really have a precise understanding&nbsp;of.</p><p><i>Question</i>: That would be enough though, to certainly destroy any\u2026 I mean I guess you have to still factor in how many of them will actually hit targets and go through defenses and what not, but there's no rival that can survive 50 nuclear strikes. So what is the argument that that's not&nbsp;enough?</p><p><i>Seth</i>: As far as the number of nuclear weapons that a country needs to have successful deterrence, opinions vary quite widely. I've seen anything from as few as 5 to as many as like, 1500. And the high numbers come from this idea that, we may need weapons for a variety of contexts, different adversaries that we may need to simultaneously deter as well as defenses and so on that these adversaries may have. And so in order to have a reliable deterrent we might need that many nuclear&nbsp;weapons.</p><p>I'm skeptical that we would need so many, but the important to understand is that ultimately deterrence is psychological. Deterrence succeeds when the other side makes a decision to not attack, and so ultimately it's not about the number of weapons, it's about the human reaction to&nbsp;that.</p><p><i>Question</i>: And we have, the United States has 7000 or&nbsp;something?</p><p><i>Seth</i>: It's in the thousands, depends on how you count it. And there is some interest in reducing the size of our arsenal, certainly in the Obama administration there was interest in that. My sense is that the main factor for progress on nuclear disarmament right now is the relationship between the United States and Russia. I think we are unlikely to unilaterally make significant cuts to our arsenal, that we would only do that in tandem with cuts from&nbsp;Russia.</p><p><i>Question</i>: What do you think the trajectory is that we're on right now? It seems like, well obviously we have a summit coming up in two days, it seems like things are not going that great. But how do you assess&nbsp;it?</p><p><i>Seth</i>: It's not clear that where we are right now can be readily described as a trajectory. Yeah. I think that's how I would sum&nbsp;it.</p><p>It's a volatile situation. I live in New York, that's one of the target cities, San Francisco is another target city. Sometimes I have my fingers crossed. But that's, I guess we'll&nbsp;see.</p><p><i>Question</i>: I know there have been major high level arms reduction agreements in the past. Has there been any breakthrough with a situation even remotely like the North Korea situation? I'm kind of struggling to come up with one. People would maybe say Libya but now that's like the warning to anybody&nbsp;else.</p><p><i>Seth</i>: The Libya example is a good one because a key attribute of the situation with North Korea is they are a much smaller country than we are. So it's a very uneven dynamic in contrast with Russia. The US considers Russia and China \"near peer\" adversaries. They might consider themselves peer adversaries. That's the term that gets used. North Korea I think, from North Korea's perspective it makes sense that they would recall the Libya example. The United States has not been trustworthy on these matters in the past and I would expect North Korea to understand that and factor that into its plans. I would be surprised if North Korea were to agree to give up its nuclear weapons. I would be very surprised to be honest. There is progress that can nonetheless be made in a talk like this, but that gets into more subtle technical details of the nuclear weapons enterprise. We'll&nbsp;see.</p><p><i>Question</i>: You spoke for a minute about branding mistakes that you and others have made as you engage with this content. Can you offer any advice about how to engage without projecting Snowden-style risk, if somebody really wants to get&nbsp;involved?</p><p><i>Seth</i>: That's a good question and the really the answer is pretty simple. It's just to understand their perspectives. So for example in my own paper that I did on this, I probably could have done a better job of sharing early drafts with people from this. I mean, there were international security people who saw the drafts. The paper went through peer review, in an international security journal and the readers actually did not flag the thing that ended up getting all the attention, so you never know. That's the sort of thing I could have done more of and that I think applies more generally. The more that we are kind of, of that world and of that community then the better we can predict how they would react to things and get people's reactions to test ideas out before putting them out more&nbsp;widely.</p><p><i>Question</i>: How much of what goes on in this space of kind of managing these international catastrophic risks happens behind the scenes and is sort of invisible to the public, versus kind of gets discussed in the&nbsp;open?</p><p><i>Seth</i>: A lot of it is behind the scenes. There is no question about that - it's a mix. It's a mix, but the public context is important. National leaders especially in democracies do need to care about the domestic reaction to what they're doing. Not just in democracies. In China, for example, there is a sense that since Xi was made like president for life, or whatever the term is, that he actually now has more flexibility to pursue international initiatives because he is in a more comfortable place domestically. So it goes both ways, there's always a bit of a negotiation on two levels, internationally and then also&nbsp;nationally.</p><p><i>Question</i>: Why are there so few women in the audience right now for this talk? Do you notice that this is sort of a gendered topic in some&nbsp;way?</p><p><i>Seth</i>: To some extent. It varies in nuclear weapons more so than, say, biological weapons. In the biological weapons space the gender breakdown is more balanced. I, as far as why, I don't think I have any particularly clever or insightful answers. What I can say is that there are some people in international security who are aware of this sort of imbalance and try to address it. Especially I think like when there is discrimination against women, which probably happens. That definitely should be recognized and countered because we lose talent, and that's a problem. I'm glad that there are at least some women in the audience and hopefully more can be in this conversation. There is actually some sense that women bring different perspectives that add something very important to these conversations. Like, for example, we talked about the marital struggle thing, that sort of contribution is kind of a traditionally female thing though of course men can do it, such as Martin Hellman, who was an equal partner on that project. I think there's an important role there and it's something good to pay attention&nbsp;to.</p><p><i>Question</i>: A clarification question on this map. What do these things represent? Are they technical projects, trying to crack AGI? Are they kind of ethical think tank type&nbsp;stuff?</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5NfMEVqLBK2q4mKickCmqA/ce76e9865889606863dacc8680931f0b/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__14_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5NfMEVqLBK2q4mKickCmqA/ce76e9865889606863dacc8680931f0b/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__14_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5NfMEVqLBK2q4mKickCmqA/ce76e9865889606863dacc8680931f0b/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__14_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5NfMEVqLBK2q4mKickCmqA/ce76e9865889606863dacc8680931f0b/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__14_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5NfMEVqLBK2q4mKickCmqA/ce76e9865889606863dacc8680931f0b/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__14_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5NfMEVqLBK2q4mKickCmqA/ce76e9865889606863dacc8680931f0b/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__14_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5NfMEVqLBK2q4mKickCmqA/ce76e9865889606863dacc8680931f0b/Baum_EAG2018-SF.ppt__14_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p><i>Seth</i>: Yes, that's a good question. These are R&amp;D projects, these are projects that are trying to build AGI, and you see it says lead and partner. The lead is the country the project is based in and the partner is when there are projects that have other collaborators from other&nbsp;countries.</p><p><i>Question</i>: Okay. What possible benefit might there be to a madman style of managing such situations? Do you see any benefit to&nbsp;that?</p><p><i>Seth</i>: So the story is that if the other side thinks you're crazy they're more likely to yield. So the classic analogy in the literature on deterrence theory is to imagine that you and someone who you really don't like are fighting each other while tied to each other by rope and right by the edge of a cliff. So what you could do is you could try to just beat up the other person and win, or you could do something that's kind of crazy, like start dancing and shimmying closer to the cliff where they start to think maybe this guy is a little crazy, maybe he actually wants to go over the cliff - or she wants to actually go over the cliff - and maybe that will induce them to yield. That's kind of the basic concept. Does it actually work in practice? Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't. Maybe it depends on the context, but that's the&nbsp;idea.</p><p><i>Question</i>: What is your outlook for the future, especially as the AGI dynamics kind of begin to develop perhaps along similar, perhaps along different lines to the nuclear dynamics? Do you think we have the prospect for kind of new age of international cooperation or are we in kind of a new dark age&nbsp;maybe?</p><p><i>Seth</i>: There's prospect for it but there's a lot of work to be done. This will all play out in the context of the international relations that we're going to be having anyway because of all this other stuff going on. So a lot of it depends on what is going on with the rest of the world. Now with all types of AI, it's important to recognize that it's not just international in the sense of between one nation and another because so much of the work is being done privately. So a lot of it might look less like, say, nuclear weapons and more like say climate change where with climate change it's mostly the private sector that are the important actors. The fossil fuel companies, the energy industry, all of that, so we can learn both from the nuclear weapons experience as far as how to get certain types of cooperation, especially on really high stakes threats and then also from climate change and similar types of issues, as far as how to handle the international cooperation on issues that are driven by the private&nbsp;sector.</p>", "user": {"username": "The Centre for Effective Altruism"}}, {"_id": "EEb4Wi7Gf9jLSLo5k", "title": "Holden Karnofsky: Fireside chat (2018)", "postedAt": "2018-06-08T07:15:00.000Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qxYS_fxWPHM&amp;list=PLwp9xeoX5p8P3cDQwlyN7qsFhC9Ms4L5W&amp;index=15\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/qxYS_fxWPHM\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><hr><p><i>In this fireside chat from EA Global 2018: San Francisco, Will MacAskill asks Holden Karnofsky of the Open Philanthropy Project about a wide range of topics.

Right now, I would say we're in an intermediate stage of our development. We've been giving away a bit over 100 million dollars a year for the last couple of years. We do want to grow that number at some point, but we believe that right now we should focus on strengthening the organization, our intellectual frameworks, our approach, and our operations. We want to get used to operating at this scale - which is big, for a grant maker - before going&nbsp;bigger.</p><p>So, it's a several year transition period. Last year, in addition to grant making, we did a lot of work to strengthen our operations, and to get more clarity on cause prioritization. How much money is eventually going to go into each of the different causes that we work in? How much should go into criminal justice reform; how much should go to support GiveWell's top charities, which we try to weigh against the other things; how much should to AI risk, biosecurity,&nbsp;etc.?</p><p>That's been the focus of the last year or so. Going forward, it's kind of the same. We're very focused on hiring right now. We just had a director of operations start, and we've been hiring pretty fast on the operations side. We're trying to build a robust organization that is ready to make a ton of grants, do it efficiently and do it with a good experience for the&nbsp;grantees.</p><p>And then, the other hiring we're doing is a push for research analysts. These are going to be the people who help us choose between causes, help us answer esoteric questions that most foundations don't analyze. Like how much money should go to each cause, and what causes we should work on. We expect our research analysts to eventually become core contributors to the organization. So, a major endeavor this year has been gearing up to make our best guess at who we should be hiring for that. It's really a capacity-building, hiring time and also a time when we're really intense about figuring out the question of how much money should go to each&nbsp;cause.</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> Fantastic. One thing you mentioned was then, something you've been working on is how do you divide the money across these very different cause areas. What progress do you feel like you've made on that over the last&nbsp;year?</p><p><strong>Holden:</strong> First, I want to give a little background on the question, because it's kind of a weird one and it's one that often doesn't come up in a philanthropic setting. We work in a bunch of very different causes. So, like I said, we work on criminal justice reform, farm animal welfare, and on global health, to name a few. We have to decide how much money goes into each cause. So one way that you might try to decide this is you might say well, what are we trying to do and how much of it are we doing for every dollar that we&nbsp;spend?</p><p>So you might say that we're trying to prevent premature deaths, and ask: \"How many premature deaths are we preventing for every dollar we spend?\" Or you might try to come up with a more inclusive, universal metric of good accomplished. There are different ways to do that. One way is to value different things according to one scale. And so you could use a framework similar to the quality framework where you say, if you avert a blindness, that's half as good as saving a life, for&nbsp;example.</p><p>And so, you could put every intervention on one scale and then say, how many units of good, so to speak, are we accomplishing for each dollar we spend? And then you would just divide up the money so that you get the maximum overall. This might look like putting money into your best cause, and at a certain point, when it's no longer your best cause because you're reaching diminishing returns, you put money into another cause, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>There's what I consider a problem with this approach, although not everyone would consider it a problem. What I consider a problem is that we've run into two mind-bending fundamental questions that seem like it's very hard to get away from. These questions are very hard to answer and then they have a really huge impact on how we give. One of them is: How do you value animals versus humans? For example, how do you value chickens versus&nbsp;humans?</p><p>One on hand, if you value, let's say, to simplify, we're deciding between GiveWell top charities which try to help humans with global health interventions: bed nets, cash transfers, things like that, versus animal advocacy groups that try to push for better treatment of animals on factory farms. Without going too much into what the numbers look like, if you decide that you value a chicken's experience 1% as much as a human's, you get the result that you should only work on chickens. All the money should go into farm animal&nbsp;welfare.</p><p>On the other hand, let's say that you go from 1% to 0.001%, or 0%. In that case, you should just put all the money toward helping humans. There's one extremely important parameter, and we don't know what its value should be. When you move to one number, it says you should put all the money over here. And when you move to another number, it says you should put all the money over there. The even trickier version of this question is when we talk about preventing global catastrophic risks or existential&nbsp;risks.</p><p>When we talk about our work on things like AI risk, biosecurity, or climate change, where the goal is not to help some specific set of persons or chickens, but rather to hopefully do something that will be positive for all future generations, the question is: How many future generations are there? If you prevent some kind of existential risk, did you just do the equivalent of preventing 7 billion premature deaths - which is about the population of the world - or did you just do the equivalent of preventing a trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion untimely deaths? It depends how many people there are in the future. It's very hard to pick the right number for that. And whichever number you do pick, it ends up taking over the whole&nbsp;model.</p><p>Based on the uncertainty around these two questions, we have determined that there are a bunch of reasons we don't want to go all in on one cause. That's something we've written up on our <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/update-cause-prioritization-open-philanthropy\">blog</a>. Among other problems, if you go all in on one cause, you get all the idiosyncrasies of that cause. If you change your mind later, you might miss a lot of opportunities to do good. It could also become very hard to be broadly appealing to donors, if your whole work is premised on one weird assumption - or one weird number - that could have been something&nbsp;different.</p><p>We don't want to be all in on one cause. So at the end of the last year, we determined that we want to have various buckets of capital, each of which is based on different assumptions. And so we might have one bucket of capital that says, preventing an existential risk is worth a trillion, trillion, trillion premature deaths averted; we value every grant by how it affects the long run trajectory of the world. And other bucket might say, we're just going to look for things that affect people alive today, or that have impact we can see in our lifetimes. And then you have another bucket that takes chickens very seriously and another one that doesn't. Then you have to determine the relative sizes of each&nbsp;bucket.</p><p>So, we have a multiple stage process where we first say there's x dollars, how much is going to be in what we call the animal-inclusive bucket versus the human-centric bucket? How much is going to be in the long-termist bucket versus the near-termist bucket? And then within each individual bucket, we use our target metrics more normally and decide how much to give to, for example, AI risk, biosecurity, and climate&nbsp;change?</p><p>A benefit of this approach is that we're attacking the problems at two parallel levels. One of them is the abstract: we have x dollars, so how much do we want to put in the animal-inclusive bucket versus the human-centric bucket? We could start with 50-50 as a prior and then say, well, we actually take this one bucket more seriously, so we'll put more in there. We could make other adjustments,&nbsp;too.</p><p>Apart from the abstract layer, we've also started moving toward addressing cause prioritization tangibly, where we create a table that says for each set of dollars we can spend, we'll get this many chickens helped and this many humans helped and this many points of reduction in existential risk. And so, under different assumptions, a given intervention might looks excellent by one metric, okay by another, and really bad by a third. So just by looking at the table, we can understand the trade-offs we're&nbsp;making.</p><p>And so a lot of the work we're doing now, and a lot of the work that I think new hires will do, is filling out that table. A lot of it is really guesswork, but if we can understand roughly what we're buying with different approaches, then hopefully we can make a decision from a better standpoint of reflective&nbsp;equilibrium.</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> As part of that, you've got to have this answer to the question of your last dollar of funding. How good is that last dollar? And how do you think about that, given this&nbsp;framework?</p><p><strong>Holden:</strong> The last dollar question is very central to our work, and closely related to our dilemma as a grantmaker. When someone sends in a grant proposal, we have to decide whether to make it or not. In some sense, that question reduces to the question of whether it's better to make the grant or save the money. And in turn, that question reduces to whether the grant will be higher impact than our last dollar&nbsp;spent.</p><p>For a long time, we had this last dollar concept that was based on GiveDirectly. GiveDirectly is a charity that gives out cash. For every $100 you give, they try to get $90 to someone in a globally low income household. If a grant's impact is lower than giving to GiveDirectly, then we probably shouldn't make it, since GiveDirectly has essentially infinite demand for money, and we could just give the money to them instead. If, however, the grant looks higher-impact than GiveDirectly, then maybe we should consider funding&nbsp;it.</p><p>Recently, we've refined our thinking, and refined the question of our last dollar. GiveDirectly is a near-termist, human-centric kind of charity, so it's a good point of comparison for that bucket. For other buckets, though, our last dollar could look very different. If instead of counting people we're helping, we're counting points of reduction in global catastrophic risks, then what does our last dollar look like? It probably doesn't look like GiveDirectly, because there are probably better ways to accomplish that long-termist&nbsp;goal.</p><p>We spent a bunch of time over the last couple of months trying to answer that question. What is the GiveDirectly of long-termism? What is the thing we can just spend unlimited money on that does as well as we can for increasing the odds of a bright future for the world? We tried a whole bunch of different things; we looked into different possibilities. Right now, we've landed on this idea of platform technology for the rapid development of medical&nbsp;countermeasures.</p><p>The idea is you would invest heavily in research and development and you would hope that what you get out from a massive investment, is the ability to more quickly develop a vaccine or treatment in case there's ever a disastrous pandemic. Then you can estimate the risk of a pandemic over different timeframes, how much this would help and how much you're going to speed it up. And our estimate ended up being that we could probably spend over 10 billion dollars, in present value terms, on this kind of&nbsp;work.</p><p>We also estimated it - this is really wild and it's just a guess, since we're trying to start with broad contours of things and then get more refined - but we estimate something like the low, low price of 245 trillion dollars per time that you prevent extinction. 245 trillion dollars per reduced extinction event actually comes out to a pretty good&nbsp;deal.</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> That's like total wealth of the world&nbsp;so-</p><p><strong>Holden:</strong> Yeah, exactly. But there's all this future wealth too, so it's actually a good deal. And the funny thing is that if you just count people who are alive today and you look at the cost per death averted probabilistically and then expected terms, it's actually pretty good. It's kind of in the same ballpark as top charities, for GiveWell. Now, very questionable analysis, because GiveWell's cost effectiveness estimates are quite rigorous and well-researched and this is emphatically&nbsp;not.</p><p>So, you don't want to go too far with that and you don't want to say these numbers are the same, and the preliminary look is we think we can probably do better than this with most of our spending. But it interesting to see that that last dollar looks like not a bad deal and that we can compare any other grants we're making to it, that have the long-term future of humanity as their target. We can say, are they better or worse than this medical countermeasure platform tech? Because we can spend as much money as we want on&nbsp;that.</p><p>We don't have a last dollar estimate yet for animal welfare. We do have a view that the current work is extremely cost effective; it's under a dollar per animal's life significantly improved in a way that's similar to a death averted. But it's more of a reducing suffering thing a lot of the time. And we do think we could expand the budget a lot before we saw diminishing returns there, so that's a number we're working with until we get a better last&nbsp;dollar.</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> Are there some cause areas that you're more personally excited about than&nbsp;others?</p><p><strong>Holden:</strong> I get differently excited about different causes on different days and I'm super excited about everything we're doing because it was all picked very carefully to be our best bet for doing the most good. As soon as a given course of action looks bad, we tend to close it&nbsp;down.</p><p>I generally am excited about everything. There's different pros and cons to the different work. The farm animal work is really exciting because we're seeing tangible wins and I think the criminal justice work also looks that way. It's just really great to be starting to see that we made a grant, something happened and it led to someone having a better life. Often, that does feel like the most&nbsp;exciting.</p><p>On the other hand, over the last couple of years, I've gotten more and more excited about the long-termist work for a different reason, which is that I've started to really believe we could be living at a uniquely high leverage moment in history. To set the stage, I think people tend to walk around thinking well, the world economy grows at around 2% a year. In real terms, maybe 1 to 3%, and that's how things are. That's how things have been for a long time, and how they will be for a long&nbsp;time.</p><p>But really, that's a weird way of thinking about things, because that rate of growth is, historically, highly anomalous. It's been only 200 or 300 years that we've had that level of growth, which is only about 10 generations. It's a tiny, tiny fraction of human history. Before that we had much slower growth. And then when we look to the future, for many, many reasons that I'm not going to get into now, we believe there are advanced technologies, such as highly capable AI, where you could either see that growth rate skyrocket and then maybe flatten out as we get radically better at doing science and developing new technologies, or you could see a global&nbsp;catastrophe.</p><p>A less happy way that our time is high leverage is that it could be possible, in the near future, to wipe ourselves out completely with nuclear weapons. There may be other ways of doing it too, like climate change and new kinds of pandemics with synthetic biology. 100 years ago, there was basically almost no reasonably likely way for humanity to go extinct. Now there are a few ways it could happen, which we want to make less likely. So there's a lot of things, both good and bad, that look special about this time that we live&nbsp;in.</p><p>It's kind of the highest upside, the highest downside, maybe that's ever been seen before. One way of thinking about it is you could think that more humanity has been around for hundreds of thousands or maybe millions of years, depending how you count it. And humanity could still be around for billions of years more, but we might be in the middle of the most important hundred&nbsp;years.</p><p>And when I think about it that way, then I think boy, someone should really be keeping their eye on this. To a large degree, however, people aren't. Even with climate change, which is better known than a lot of other risks, sufficient action is not being taken. Governments are not making it a priority to the extent that I think they reasonably should. So as people who have the freedom to spend money how we want and the ability to think about these things and act on them without having to worry about a profit motive or accountability to near-term outcomes, we're in a really special position to do something and I think that it's exciting. It's also&nbsp;scary.</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> Over the last year, what are some particular grants that you think people in the audience might not know as much about, that you are particularly excited about, that you think are going to be particularly good or&nbsp;important?</p><p><strong>Holden:</strong> There are many grants I'm excited about. I'm guessing people know about things like our OpenAI grant, and our many grants to support animal welfare or corporate campaigning in the U.S., and abroad in India, Europe, Latin America, et. I'll skip over those, and name some others people might not have heard&nbsp;of.</p><p>I'm very excited about the AI Fellows Program. We recently announced a set of early career AI scientists who we are giving fellowships to. It was a very competitive process. These scientists are really, really exceptional. They're some of the best AI researchers, flat out, for their career stage. They're also interested in AI safety, not just in making AI more powerful but in making it something that's going to have better outcomes, behave better, have fewer bugs, etc. They are interested in working on the alignment problem, and things like&nbsp;that.</p><p>We found a great combination of really excellent technical abilities, seriousness and an open-mindedness to some of the less mainstream parts of AI that we think are the most important, like the alignment problem. Our goal here is to help these fellows learn from the AI safety community and get up to speed, and become some of the best AI safety researchers out there. We also hope to make it common knowledge in AI that working on AI safety is a good career move. It's exciting, as a foundation, to be engaging in field building making work on AI safety a good career&nbsp;move.</p><p>Another exciting development is that our science team is working on a universal antiviral drug. We believe that a lot of viruses - maybe all of them - rely on particular proteins in your body to replicate themselves and to have their effects. So, if you can inhibit those proteins, and we already have some drugs that do inhibit them which we use for cancer treatment, you might have a drug that, while you wouldn't want to take every time you got a virus, it might work on every virus. Which could make it a really excellent thing to have if some unexpectedly terrible pandemic comes, and an excellent thing to stockpile. So, that's super&nbsp;cool.</p><p>Also, I'm often excited for grants we make that are all about speed. So there's a couple of science grants where there's a technology that looks great, everyone's excited about it and there's not much to argue about. Gene drives to potentially eradicate malaria, for example. And an experimental treatment for sepsis that could save a lot of lives, is another. For these good, exciting things, we speed their development&nbsp;up.</p><p>I feel proud as an organization and of our operations team, that we're sometimes able to make a grant where we're like, yeah, everyone knows this is good, but we're the fastest. We can get the money out right away, and we can make these good things happen sooner, and happening sooner saves enough lives that it's a good&nbsp;deal.</p><p>So, those are some of the things I'm particularly excited&nbsp;about.</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> What do you wish was happening in the EA community that currently isn't? That might be projects, organizations, career paths, lines of intellectual inquiry and so&nbsp;on.</p><p><strong>Holden:</strong> I think the EA community is an exciting thing and a great source of interesting ideas. Members of the EA community have affected our thinking, and our cause prioritization, a lot. But I think right now, it's a community that is very heavy on people who are philosopher types, economist types and computer programmer types, all of which somewhat describe&nbsp;me.</p><p>We have a lot of those types of person, and I think they do a lot of good. But I would like to see a broader variety of different types of people in the community. Because I think there are people who are more intuitive thinkers who wouldn't want to sit around at a party debating whether the parameter for the moral weight of chickens is 1% or 0.01%, and what anthropics might have to do with&nbsp;that.</p><p>They might not be interested in that, but they still have serious potential as effective altruists because they're able to say, \"I would like to help people and I would like to do it as well as I can.\" And so they might be able to say things like, \"Boy there's an issue in the world. Maybe it's animal welfare, maybe it's AI, or maybe it's something else. It's so important and no one's working on it. I think there's something I can do about it, so I want to work on&nbsp;that.\"</p><p>You don't need to engage in hours of philosophy to get there. And I think a lot of people who are more intuitive thinkers who may be less interested in philosophical underpinnings have a lot to offer us as a community, and can accomplish a lot of things that the philosopher/programmer/economist type is not always as strong in. More diversity is something I would love to see. I would like to see it if the Effective Altruism Community could find a way to get a broader variety of people, and be a little bit more like&nbsp;that.</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> You're managing a lot of money, and there's a lot at stake. How do you keep yourself sane? Do you overwork? How do you balance working with time&nbsp;off?</p><p><strong>Holden:</strong> I think we're working on a lot of exciting stuff, and I certainly know people who when they're working on exciting stuff, they work all the time and tend to burn out. I've pretty intense about not doing that. I co-founded GiveWell 11 years ago, and been working continuously since then. GiveWell, and now Open Philanthropy. Maybe at the beginning it felt like I was sprinting, but right now it really, really feels like a marathon. I try to treat it that&nbsp;way.</p><p>I'm very attentive to if I start feeling a lack of motivation. When that happens, I just take a break. I do a lot of really stupid things with my time that put me in a better mood. I don't feel bad about it&nbsp;and-</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> Name some stupid things, go&nbsp;on.</p><p><strong>Holden:</strong> Like going to weird conferences where I don't know anyone or have anything to contribute and talking there. Playing video games. My wife and I like to have stuffed animals with very bizarre personalities and act out. So now you know some&nbsp;things.</p><p>And I don't feel bad about it. Something that I've done, actually for a long time now, I think starting two years into GiveWell, is that I tracked my focused hours, my meaningful hours. And at a certain point, I just took an average over like the last six months and I was like, that's my target, that's the average. When I hit the average, I'm done for the week, unless it's a special week, and I really need to work more that&nbsp;week.</p><p>This approach is sustainable, and I think going in more than the average wouldn't be. Also, it puts me in a mindset where I know how many hours I have, and I have to make the most of them. I think there are people who say, \"If I can just work hard enough, I'll get everything done.\" But I don't think that works for me, and I think it is often a bad idea to think that way in general. One way that I think about it is that the most you can increase your output from working harder is often around&nbsp;25%.</p><p>If you want to increase your output by 5x, or by 10x, you can't just work harder. You need to get better at skipping things, deciding what not to do, deciding what shortcuts to take. And also you need to get good at hiring, managing, deciding who should be doing what, deciding it shouldn't be you doing a lot of things. I feel like my productivity has gone up by a very large amount and there is a lot of variance. Like when I make bad decisions, I might only get a tenth as much done in a month. But working more hours doesn't fix that. So even though I think we're doing a lot of exciting stuff, I do take it easy in some&nbsp;sense.</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> Over the last decade, what do you think is some of the biggest mistakes you've made, or things you wish you'd done&nbsp;differently?</p><p><strong>Holden:</strong> I've got lots of fun mistakes. But you said last decade, which rules out a lot of the fun&nbsp;stuff.</p><p>I will say a couple of things. One thing is that I think early on, and still sometimes, we've communicated in a careless way. Especially early on, our view was that more attention was better, that we really needed to get people paying attention to us. And the problem is that a lot of the things we said, they'll never go away: the internet never&nbsp;forgets.</p><p>And I think also people who may have been turned off by our early communications, we'll never get the second chance to make that first impression. When I look back at it, I think was it really wasn't that important to get so much attention. I think over the long run, if we had just been quiet and said something when we really had something to say, and said it carefully, maybe things would have gone better. We've really succeeded to the extent that we've succeeded, just having research that we can explain and that people resonate with. I don't know that we had to seek attention much beyond that,&nbsp;too.</p><p>Another mistake that I look back on, I think I was too slow to get excited about the Effective Altruism Community. When we were starting off, I knew that we were working on something that most people didn't seem to care about. I knew that we were asking the question, how do we do the most good that we can with a certain amount of resources? And I knew that there were other people asking a similar question, but we were speaking very different languages from each other. And so it was hard for me to really see that those people were asking the same question that I&nbsp;was.</p><p>I think we were a bit dismissive. I wouldn't say totally dismissive, since we talked to the proto-effective-altruists before it was called effective altruism. But it didn't occur to me that if I was missing important insights about my work, the most likely way to find those insights was to find people who have the same goal as me, but had different&nbsp;perspectives.</p><p>And the fact that the Effective Altruism Community speaks a different language from me and a lot of their stuff sounds loopy, I mean, that's just good. That means that there's going to be at least some degree of different perspective between us. I think we've profited a lot from engaging with the EA community. We've learned a lot and we could have done it earlier, so I think waiting was a&nbsp;mistake.</p><p>And then the final thing, here's a class of mistakes that I won't go into detail on. In general, I feel like the decisions these days that I'm most nervous about are hiring and recruiting, because most of the things we do at Open Phil, we've figured out how to do them in an incremental way. We do something, we see how it goes, and no single step is ever that disastrous or that&nbsp;epic.</p><p>But when you're recruiting, you just have someone asking you, \"Should I leave my job or not?\" And you have to say yes or no. It's such an incredibly high leverage decision that it's become clear to me that when we do it wrong, it's a huge problem and a huge cost to us. When we do it right, however, it improves everything we do. Basically, everything we've been able to do is because of the people that we&nbsp;have.</p><p>Hiring decisions really are the make or break decisions, and we often have to make them in a week and with limited information. Sometimes we get them right, and sometimes we get them wrong, I think there's a lot of ones we've gotten wrong that I don't know about. And so a lot of the biggest mistakes have to be in that&nbsp;category.</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> So then what career advice would you give the EAs in the audience who are currently figuring out what they ought to do? How do you think about that question in&nbsp;general?</p><p><strong>Holden:</strong> In some sense, I have only one career to look at, although since we interact with a lot of grantees, we also do notice who's having a big impact according to us and what's been their trajectory. And one thing that I do think whenever I talk to people about this topic, I get the sense that effective altruists, especially early in their career, are often too impatient for impact in the short&nbsp;term.</p><p>A lot of the people I know who seem to be in the best position to do something big, they did something for five years, 10 years, 20 years. Sometimes the thing was random but they picked up skills, they picked up connections, they picked up expertise. A lot of the big wins we've seen, both stuff we've founded and stuff we haven't, it looks less like someone came out of college and had impact every year, and then it added up to something good. It looks more like someone might have just been working on themselves and their career for 20 years, and then they had one really good year and that's everything. That one good year can make your career in terms of your impact. I do think a lot of early career effective altruists might do better if they made the opposite mistake, which I also think would also be a mistake, and just forgot about impact. If they just said, \"What can I be good at? How can I grow? How can I become the person I want to be?\" I think that probably wouldn't be worse than the current status quo, and it might be better. I think the ideal is some kind of balance. I don't know if I'm right or not, but it's definitely advice that I give a&nbsp;lot.</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> A couple of people are interested in the small question of just what is your average numbers of hours per week then? I think you can say no comment if you&nbsp;don't\u2026</p><p><strong>Holden:</strong> For focused hours, for the time I was doing it, it was like 40. Hours on the clock would be more than that. And then recently I've actually stopped counting them up because now I'm in meetings all the time. And one of the things that I've found is that my hours are way higher when I have a ton of meetings. If I'm sitting there trying to write a blog post, they are way lower. My hours worked don't seem as worth tracking as they used&nbsp;to.</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> Yeah. I mean, different sorts of hours can be a hundred times more valuable. Like, Frank Ramsey was one of the most important thinkers of the early 20th century, but died at 26, which is why no one knows about him. He just worked four hours a day. He made amazing breakthroughs in philosophy, decision theory, economics, and&nbsp;maths.</p><p><strong>Holden:</strong> Yeah, that's&nbsp;incredible.</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> Another thing a couple of people were interested in was Open Phil's attitudes toward political funding. Firstly, just whether you have a policy with respect to funding organizations that do political lobbying. And then secondly, in particular, if you'd fund particular candidates more than other candidates who may increase or decrease existential&nbsp;risks.</p><p><strong>Holden:</strong> There's no real reason in principle that OpenPhil can't make political donations. We treat political giving, or policy-oriented giving, the same as anything else. Which is we say hey, if we work on this, what are the odds that our funding contributes to something good happening in the world and what is the value of that good? And if you multiply out the probabilities, how good does that make the work look? How does it compare to our last dollar, and how does it compare to our other&nbsp;work?</p><p>If it looks good enough and there aren't other concerns, we'll do it. Most of our grants, we're not actually calculating these figures explicitly, but we're trying to do something that approximates them. For example, we work on causes that are important, neglected and tractable. And we tend to rate things on importance, neglectedness and tractability, because we think those things are predictive and corellative with the total good accomplished per&nbsp;dollar.</p><p>A lot of times you can't really get a good estimate of how much good you're doing per dollar, but you can use that idea to guide yourself and to motivate yourself. But I do think that some ways, in politics, there's an elevated risk of inaccurate estimation. You should have an elevated risk that you're just wrong. If it looks like giving to bed nets to prevent malaria helps people a certain amount, and giving to some very controversial issue that you're sure you're right about, helps people a certain amount, and they're the same, probably the bed nets are better, because you've probably got some bias towards what you want to believe in&nbsp;politics.</p><p>That said, I don't think things are necessarily balanced. On political issues, people have a lot of reasons for holding the political views they do, other than what's best for the world as a whole. And so when our goal is what's best for the world as a whole, it's not always that complicated to figure out which side is the side to go in on. It's not always impossible to see. We can and do fund things that are aimed at changing policy. And in some cases, we've recommended contributions that are trying to change political&nbsp;outcomes.</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> What are your plans are for trying to influence other major foundations and&nbsp;philanthropists?</p><p><strong>Holden:</strong> One of the cool things about Open Phil is that we are trying to do our work in a way where we find out how to help the most people with the least money, or how to do the most good with the least money, per dollar. Then we recommend our findings to our main funders, who are Cari and Dustin. But there's no reason that recommendation would be different for another&nbsp;person.</p><p>A lot of times, if there were a Will MacAskill foundation, maybe it would be about what Will wants and its recommendations would not be interesting to other people. Actually, I know <i>your</i> foundation would not have that issue, but many people's would. We want the lessons we learn and research we accomplish to be applicable for other philanthropists, rather than only our particular&nbsp;funders.</p><p>Down the line, I would love it to be the case that we see way more good things to do with money than Cari and Dustin have money. In that case, we'd go out and pitch to other people on it and try to raise far more than Cari and Dustin could give. That's definitely where we're trying to go. But it's not what we're focused on right now, because we're still below the giving level we would need just to accomplish the giving goals of Cari and Dustin. We're focused on meeting those goals for now, and we're focused on improving our&nbsp;organization.</p><p>We want more of a track record, a stronger intellectual framework, and just to be better in general. We'd like Something more solid to point to and say, here's our reason that this is a good way to do philanthropy. We make early moves now: we talk to people who are philanthropists, or who will be philanthropists, but it's not our big focus now. I think in a few years, it could&nbsp;be.</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> You've emphasized criminal justice reform, existential risks with bio and AI, animal welfare, and global health. Are there another causes that you think you'll branch out into over the next couple of years? And if so, what might those be? What are some potential&nbsp;candidates?</p><p><strong>Holden:</strong> I mean, over the next few years, we're trying to stay focused when it comes to our grant making. But as we're doing that, we also want to find more clarity around, again, this question of long-termism versus near-termism and how much money is going to each. I think that will affect how we look for new cause areas in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>So I think we will look for new causes in the future, but it's not our biggest focus in the immediate term. One thing we do currently, however, is a lot of the time we will pick a cause based on, partly, who we can hire for it. We're very big believers in a people-centric approach to giving. We believe that a lot of times if you support someone who's really good, it makes an enormous difference. Even if maybe the cause is 10% worse, it can be worth it if the person is way more&nbsp;promising.</p><p>We originally had a bunch of policy causes we were interested in hiring for. Criminal justice became a major cause for us, and the other ones didn't, because we found someone who we were excited to lead our criminal justice reform work - that's Chloe Cockburn - and we didn't for some of the other ones. But I would say, one cause we may get more involved in in the future, and I hope we do, is macroeconomic stabilization policy. It's not the world's best known cause. The idea is that some of the most important decisions in the world are made at the Federal Reserve, which is trying to balance the risks of inflation and&nbsp;unemployment.</p><p>We've come to the view that there's an institutional bias in a particular direction. We believe that there is more inflation aversion than is consistent with a \"most good for everyone\" attitude. We think some of that bias reflects the politics and pressures around the Federal Reserve. We've been interested in macroeconomic stabilization for a while. There's this not very well-known institution, which is not very well understood and makes esoteric decisions. It's not a big political issue, but it may have a bigger impact on the world economy and on the working class than basically anything else the government is doing. Maybe even bigger than anything else that anyone is&nbsp;doing.</p><p>So I would love to get more involved in that cause but I think to do it really well, we would need someone who's all the way in. I mean, we would need someone who's just obsessed with that issue, because it's very&nbsp;complex.</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> Do you feel like that's justified on the near-termist human-centric view, or do you think it's got potentially very long-run impacts&nbsp;too?</p><p><strong>Holden:</strong> I think it's kind of a twofer. We haven't tried to do the calculations on both axes, but certainly, it seems like it could provide broad-based growth and lower unemployment. There are a lot of reasons to think thoseat might lead to better societal outcomes. Outcomes such as better broad-based values, which are then reflected in the kinds of policies we enact and the kinds of people we&nbsp;elect.</p><p>I also think that if the economy is growing, and especially if that growth is benefiting everyone across the economy: if labor markets are tighter, and if workers have better bargaining power, better lives, better prospects in the future, then global catastrophic risk might decrease in some way. I haven't totally decided, how does the magnitude of that compare to everything else? But I think if we had the opportunity to go bigger on that cause, we would be thinking harder about&nbsp;it.</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> Could something happen or could you learn something such that you'd say, okay, actually we're just going to go all in on one cause? Like is that conceivable, or are you going to stay diversified no matter&nbsp;what?</p><p><strong>Holden:</strong> I think it's conceivable. We could go all in, but not soon. I think as long as we think of ourselves as an early stage organization, one of the big reasons to not go all in is option value. We get to learn about a lot of different kinds of giving, and we're building capacity for a lot of things, so I want to have the option to change our minds&nbsp;later.</p><p>There's a bunch of advantages to being spread out across different causes. Maybe in 30 years we'll just be like, \"Well, we've been at this forever and we're not going to change or minds, so now we're going all in.\" And that's something I can imagine, but I can't really imagine it happening&nbsp;soon.</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> What attitudes should a small individual donor have? A couple of thoughts, one is like, well, can they donate to Open Phil or Good Ventures? Another is, what's the point in <i>me</i> donating, if there's this huge foundation that I think is very&nbsp;good?</p><p><strong>Holden:</strong> Individual donors cannot to donate to Open Phil at the moment. We just haven't set that process up. One possible alternative is the <a href=\"https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds\">Effective Altruism Funds</a> at CEA. Some of our stuff manage donor-advised funds that are not Open Phil, that are outside Open Phil. But you can give to an animal welfare fund that is run by Lewis, who's our farm animal welfare program officer, and he will look at what was he not able to fund that he wished he could have funded with Open Phil funds, and he'll use your funds on&nbsp;it.</p><p>More broadly, I think donating can definitely do a lot of good, despite Open Phil's existence. The capital we're working with is a lot compared to any individual, but it's not a lot compared to the size of the need in the world, and the amount of good that we can&nbsp;accomplish.</p><p>Certainly, we do not believe, given our priorities, given the weight that we're putting on long-termism versus near-termism, we are now pretty confident that we just do not have enough available to fund the GiveWell top charities to their&nbsp;capacity.</p><p>So, you can donate toward bed nets to prevent malaria, seasonal chemoprevention treatment also to prevent malaria, deworming, and other cool programs. You can donate there and you will get an amazing deal in terms of helping people for a little money. I know some people don't feel satisfied with that; they think they can do better with long-termism or with an animal-centric view. I think if you're animal-centric, we also currently have some limits on the budget for animal welfare and you can give to that Effective Altruism Fund or you can look at Animal Charity Evaluators and their recommendations, or just give to farm animal groups that you believe&nbsp;in.</p><p>Long-termism right now is the one where it's the least obvious what someone should do. But I think there are still things to do, to reduce global catastrophic risks. Among the things going on, we're currently very hesitant to be more than 50% of any organization's budget, unless we feel incredibly well positioned to be their only point of&nbsp;accountability.</p><p>There are organizations where we say we understand exactly what's going on, and we're fine to be the only decision-maker on how the org is doing. But for other orgs, we just don't want them to be that dependent on us. So there are orgs working on existential risk reduction, global catastrophic risk reduction and effective altruist community building. Most of them we just won't go over 50%. And so they need, in some sense, to match our money with money from&nbsp;others.</p><p>I would say that generally, no matter what you're into, there's definitely something good you can do with your money. I still think donating is&nbsp;good.</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> Are you interested in funding AI strategy, and have you funded it in the&nbsp;past?</p><p><strong>Holden:</strong> AI strategy is a huge interest of ours. One way of putting it is when we think about potential risk from very advanced AI, we think of two problems that interact with each other and make each other potentially worse. It's very hard to see the future, but these are things that are worth thinking about because of how big a deal they would&nbsp;be.</p><p>One of them is the value alignment problem, and that's the idea that it may be very hard to build something that's much smarter than anyone who built it, much better at thinking in every way and much better at optimizing, and still have that thing behave itself, so to speak. It may be very hard to get it to do what its creator intended and do it more intelligently than they would, but not too differently. That's the value alignment problem. It's mostly considered a technical&nbsp;problem.</p><p>A lot of the research that's going on is on how we can build AI systems that work with vague goals. Humans are likely to give vague goals to AI. So how can they work with vague, poorly defined goals, and still figure them out in a way that's in line with the original human&nbsp;intentions?</p><p>Also, how can we build AI systems that are robust? We want AI systems that, if they trained to one environment and then the environment changes, don't totally break. They should realize that they're dealing with something new, so that they don't totally do crazy things. These are the kinds of ideas that comprise the alignment problem, which can mostly be addressed through technical&nbsp;research.</p><p>There's also this other side we think about, the deployment problem, which is what if you have an extremely powerful general purpose technology that could lead to a really large concentration of power? Then we ask: who wields that power? I mean, is it the government, is it a company, is it a person? Who has the moral right to launch such a thing and to say hey, I have this very powerful thing and I'm going to use it to change the world in some&nbsp;way?</p><p>Who has the right to do that, and what kind of outcomes can we expect based on if different groups do it? One of the things that we're worried about is that you might have a world where, let's say, two different countries are both trying to be the first to develop a very powerful AI. Because if they can, they believe it'll help their power, their standing in the world. And because they're in this race and because they're competitive with each other, they're cutting corners and they're launching as fast as they can. Under this sort of pressure, they might not be very careful about solving the alignment problem. And so they could release a carelessly designed AI, which ends up unaligned. Meaning, the AI could end up behaving in crazy ways and having bugs. And something that's very intelligent and very powerful and has bugs could be very, very&nbsp;bad.</p><p>So AI strategy, in my take, is working on the deployment problem. Reducing the odds that there's going to be this arms race or whatever, increasing the odds that there's instead a deliberate wise decision about what powerful AI is going to be used for and who's going to make that decision. There are a lot of really interesting questions there. We're super interested in&nbsp;it.</p><p>We've definitely made grants in the AI strategy area: we've supported The Future of Humanity Institute to do work on it. We're currently investigating a couple of other grants there, too. We've put out a job posting for someone who wants to think about AI strategy all day, and doesn't have another place to go. If we find such a person who's good enough at it, we could fund them&nbsp;ourselves.</p><p>And then also, we support OpenAI to help both with the control problem and the deployment problem. We're trying to encourage OpenAI as an organization to do a lot of technical safety research, but also to be thinking hey, we're a company that might lead AI. What are we going to do if we're there? Who are we going to loop in? We're going to be in conversations about how this thing should be used. What's our position going to be on who should use&nbsp;it?</p><p>We've really encouraged them to build out a team of people who can be thinking about that question all the time, and they are working on that. And so, this is a major interest of&nbsp;ours.</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> You mentioned one of the key ways in which it could be a worry is if there's an arms race. Perhaps licitly, if it's war time or something. Would you be interested, and how do you think about trying to make grants to reduce the chance of some sort of great power&nbsp;war?</p><p><strong>Holden:</strong> I think it would be really good to have lower odds of a great power war, just flat out. Maybe some of the possibility for advanced technologies makes it even more good to reduce the odds of a great power war, and that's an area that we have not spent much time on. I know there is a reasonable amount of foundation interest in promoting peace. And so it's not immediately neglected at first&nbsp;glance.</p><p>That said, a lot of things that look like they're getting attention at first glance, you refine your model a little bit, you decide what the most promising angle on it is, and you might find that there's something neglected. So preventing great power war might be an example of a really awesome cause that we haven't had the capacity to look into. And if someone else saw something great to do, they should definitely not wait for&nbsp;us.</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> Another cause that some people were asking about was suffering of animals in the wild, whether you might be interested in making grants to improve that&nbsp;issue.</p><p><strong>Holden:</strong> Sure. Off the bat, you have to ask if there's anything you could do to improve wild animal welfare that wouldn't cause a lot of other problems. We could potentially cause a lot of problems; there might be a kind of hubris in intervening in very complex ecosystems that we didn't create and that we don't properly&nbsp;understand.</p><p>Another problem with working on wild animal welfare is we haven't seen a lot of shovel-ready actions to take. Something I will say is there's probably a lot going on where human activity or some other factor is causing wild animals to suffer. There are probably animals in the wild, a really large number of them, that could be a lot better off than they are. Maybe they could just could have better lives if not for certain things about the ecosystem they're in that humans may or may not have&nbsp;caused.</p><p>And so I see potential there. But we've got the issue I mentioned, where what we can do about it isn't obvious. It's not obvious how to write grants to improve the welfare of animals in the wild, without having a bunch of problems come along with&nbsp;them.</p><p>It hasn't been that clear to us, but we are continuing to talk about it. Looking into it in the background is something we may do in the&nbsp;future.</p><p><strong>Will:</strong> In the 2017 year review, you said well we've actually already been able to see some successes in criminal justice reform and animal welfare. So I'd be interested if you'd just talk a bit more about that and then, what lessons do you feel you've learned, and whether they transfer to the things which are harder to measure&nbsp;success?</p><p><strong>Holden:</strong> So, we're early. We've only been doing large scale grantmaking for a couple of years. A lot of our grantmaking is on these long timeframes, so it's a little early to be asking, do we see impact? But I would say we're seeing early hints of impact. The clearest case is farm animal welfare. We came in when there were a couple of big victories that had been achieved, like a McDonald's pledge that all their eggs will be cage-free. So there was definitely already&nbsp;momentum.</p><p>So we came in, and we poured gasoline on it. We went to all the groups that had been getting these wins and we went to some of the groups that hadn't and we said, \"Would you like to do more? Would you like to grow your staff? Would you like to go after these groups?\" And within a year, basically every major grocer and every major fast food company in America had made a cage-free pledge,&nbsp;approximately.</p><p>And so hopefully, if those pledges are adhered to, which is a question and something we work on, but hopefully 10 years from now you won't even be able to get eggs from caged chickens in the U.S., it'll be very impractical to do so. That'd be nice. I mean, I'm not happy with how the cage-free chickens are treated either, but it's a lot better. It's a big step up and I think it's also a big morale win for the movement and creates some momentum, because from there, what we've been doing now is starting to build the international corporate campaigns. Some of those already existed and some of them didn't, but we have been funding work all over the world. Next time, we would love to be part of those early wins that got the ball rolling, rather than coming in late and trying to make things go faster. We've seen wins on broiler chickens, which is the next step in the U.S. after layer hens. We've seen wins overseas, so that's been exciting. And these corporate campaigns had been one of the quicker things we funded. Because I think a lot of times with corporations, it wouldn't actually cost them that much to treat their chickens better. Somebody just has to complain loudly about it and then it happens, seems to be how it&nbsp;goes.</p><p>In criminal justice reform, we picked that cause partly because we saw the opportunity to potentially make a difference and get some wins on a lot of other policy causes. One of the early things we noticed was a couple of bipartisan bills in Illinois that we think are going to have quite a large impact on incarceration there and that we believe that our grantees, with our marginal funding, were crucial&nbsp;for.</p><p>We've also seen the beginning of a mini-wave of prosecutors getting elected - head prosecutors - who have different values from the normal head prosecutors. So instead of being tough on crime, they frame things in different terms. For example, Larry Krasner in Philadelphia has put out a memo out to his whole office that says, \"When you propose someone's sentence, you are going to have to estimate the cost of that to the state. It's like $45,000 a year to put someone in prison, and you're going to have to explain why it is worth that money to us to put this person in prison. And if you want to start a plea bargain and you want to start it lower than the minimum sentence, you're going to have to get my permission. I'm the head&nbsp;prosecutor.\"</p><p>It's a different attitude. These prosecutors are saying, \"My goal is not to lock up as many people as possible, my goal is to balance costs and benefits and do right by my community.\" And I think there have been a bunch of orgs and a bunch of funders involved in that. I don't think any of these are things I would call Open Philanthropy productions. They're things that we think we helped with, we sped along, we got some share of the work being&nbsp;done.</p><p>We're excited about that. Those are two of the causes that have nearer-term ambitions. I can't say I've seen wins on biosecurity yet, I mean other than the fact that there's been no pandemic that killed everyone. But I can't give us any credit for&nbsp;that.</p><p>I also think about our small wins now as lessons for the future. I think we've seen what's been working and what's not in those causes where there's more action and more things happening. I think one of the things that we are seeing is our basic setup of giving program officers high autonomy, has been working pretty well. A lot of these grants are not the ones I would have come up with. And in some cases, they weren't even ones I was very excited about beforehand. We have systems for trying to give our program officers the ability to sometimes make grants that we don't fully agree with, and try to reduce veto points. We try to reduce the need for total consensus, and have people at the organization try and make bets that may not be universally agreed to or even agreed to by me, or Cari and Dustin. And I think looking at some of the grants that have been effective, that that's been a good move. So I will continue to do things that don't seem right to me, and I'm very excited about&nbsp;that.</p>", "user": {"username": "The Centre for Effective Altruism"}}, {"_id": "aZj4irNgxcJuHu4Xt", "title": "Sam Carter and Joe Huston: The science behind Universal Basic Income", "postedAt": "2018-06-08T07:15:00.000Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lyOAANc7hgU&amp;list=PLwp9xeoX5p8P3cDQwlyN7qsFhC9Ms4L5W&amp;index=14\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/lyOAANc7hgU\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><hr><p><i>In this discussion from EA Global 2018: San Francisco, Sam Carter and Joe Huston discuss universal basic income: what we know about it, what we'd like to know about it, and what research we're working on to bridge the gap.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>A transcript of their talks, including their answers to audience questions, is below.

UBI is a cash-transfer that is, as the name implies, universal, meaning that all people in a given area receive it. It is not targeted at specific populations, and there are no conditions placed on how the money may be used. The transfer is regularly recurring, delivered over the long term, and sufficient to meet basic&nbsp;needs.</p><p>Around the world, there are studies taking place to better understand the various iterations of UBI, and their potential impacts. So, what explains the widespread interest in UBI&nbsp;today?</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/34tNgONxocGy04I8CmOa4U/4e2dd5d94d70412636c2c54f051f78c2/UBI_Slide_2.png?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/34tNgONxocGy04I8CmOa4U/4e2dd5d94d70412636c2c54f051f78c2/UBI_Slide_2.png?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/34tNgONxocGy04I8CmOa4U/4e2dd5d94d70412636c2c54f051f78c2/UBI_Slide_2.png?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/34tNgONxocGy04I8CmOa4U/4e2dd5d94d70412636c2c54f051f78c2/UBI_Slide_2.png?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/34tNgONxocGy04I8CmOa4U/4e2dd5d94d70412636c2c54f051f78c2/UBI_Slide_2.png?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/34tNgONxocGy04I8CmOa4U/4e2dd5d94d70412636c2c54f051f78c2/UBI_Slide_2.png?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/34tNgONxocGy04I8CmOa4U/4e2dd5d94d70412636c2c54f051f78c2/UBI_Slide_2.png?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>On the one hand, in many high-income countries, like the US, the economy is being rapidly transformed by technology. Automation is getting cheaper and better every day. According to one study by economists at MIT and Boston University, each robot that came into the world between 1993 and 2007 reduced the number of available jobs by 5.6. Automation has already displaced workers, and likely will continue to, especially in certain industries. This makes UBI a potentially attractive policy option, for those who are concerned about the wellbeing of workers left behind by automation and technology&nbsp;advances.</p><p>On the other hand, while the world has made large strides in reducing poverty, more than 700 million people still live on less than $1.90 per day. Especially in low income countries, where the extreme poor live, UBI is seen as a policy option to help bring adults and children up to the poverty line, and ensure that their basic needs are&nbsp;met.</p><p>In high-income and low-income countries alike, there are often concerns about the effectiveness of existing social safety net programs. People wonder if current programs are as effective as they could be. Programs might stigmatize recipients, for example, or be ineffectively delivered. And, with the proliferation of the gig economy and alternative work arrangements, employer-based approaches to social welfare, like many of those that we have in place today, may not be suitable in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Like with any potentially disruptive new approach, there are supporters and detractors of UBI. Supporters argue that UBI might be more efficient than existing social programs, that its unconditional nature offers recipients flexibility and autonomy, and that new technology makes it more feasible than ever to distribute basic income&nbsp;transfers.</p><p>On the other hand, detractors raise concerns about UBI being too costly to be a reasonable solution, and about the ways recipients might use unconditional cash. Also, despite new technology, the infrastructure to receive payments may not exist in all contexts, especially those where the poorest people&nbsp;live.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1eYvOjP6WekwmuOs2a6A2G/2b2829b49ffe5530c41a369c317e2021/UBI_Slide_3.png?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1eYvOjP6WekwmuOs2a6A2G/2b2829b49ffe5530c41a369c317e2021/UBI_Slide_3.png?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1eYvOjP6WekwmuOs2a6A2G/2b2829b49ffe5530c41a369c317e2021/UBI_Slide_3.png?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1eYvOjP6WekwmuOs2a6A2G/2b2829b49ffe5530c41a369c317e2021/UBI_Slide_3.png?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1eYvOjP6WekwmuOs2a6A2G/2b2829b49ffe5530c41a369c317e2021/UBI_Slide_3.png?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1eYvOjP6WekwmuOs2a6A2G/2b2829b49ffe5530c41a369c317e2021/UBI_Slide_3.png?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1eYvOjP6WekwmuOs2a6A2G/2b2829b49ffe5530c41a369c317e2021/UBI_Slide_3.png?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>There are valid points on both sides of this debate. How can we, as effective altruists, decide where to put our weight as a community, and what more do we need to&nbsp;know?</p><p>Let's look at some existing evidence. First, let's consider the concern that receiving cash with no conditions attached might lead to a reduction in work. On average, there is evidence that it doesn't lead to such a reduction. Next, let's consider concerns that cash given with few or no strings attached will be squandered. In Kenya, researchers tested a program implemented by GiveDirectly, which transferred a lump sum of money to poor households. They found that it led to increases in both economic and non-economic wellbeing, and did not lead to increases in spending on temptation goods like alcohol or&nbsp;tobacco.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5EmjmJzoWIAkcYQq8MY08W/cdc9c69ea6d2cc4f4e87e09bf45d06c6/UBI_Slide_4.png?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5EmjmJzoWIAkcYQq8MY08W/cdc9c69ea6d2cc4f4e87e09bf45d06c6/UBI_Slide_4.png?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5EmjmJzoWIAkcYQq8MY08W/cdc9c69ea6d2cc4f4e87e09bf45d06c6/UBI_Slide_4.png?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5EmjmJzoWIAkcYQq8MY08W/cdc9c69ea6d2cc4f4e87e09bf45d06c6/UBI_Slide_4.png?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5EmjmJzoWIAkcYQq8MY08W/cdc9c69ea6d2cc4f4e87e09bf45d06c6/UBI_Slide_4.png?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5EmjmJzoWIAkcYQq8MY08W/cdc9c69ea6d2cc4f4e87e09bf45d06c6/UBI_Slide_4.png?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5EmjmJzoWIAkcYQq8MY08W/cdc9c69ea6d2cc4f4e87e09bf45d06c6/UBI_Slide_4.png?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>What's important to note, however, is that these outcomes were measured less than a year after the transfer was given, and if we're trying to understand cash transfers as a way to reduce poverty, and if we're trying to think about them as a way to inform our opinions about UBI, we should probably consider longer-term&nbsp;effects.</p><p>Fortunately, we have some research on that as well. Researchers in Uganda and Sri Lanka have found that unsupervised cash grants, distributed in a business setting, had positive impacts on business investment, profits, and household income after 4 or 5 years. In Uganda, the grants were given to groups of young people who had submitted business plans. In Sri Lanka, grants were given to micro-enterprise owners. If we want to understand the relevance of cash transfers for UBI, however, we might want to think about cash outside of the context of&nbsp;business.</p><p>For a less business-centered context, we can turn back to the study that researchers did of GiveDirectly's program in Kenya. The researchers, Johannes Haushofer and Jeremy Shapiro, released longer-term results from that cash transfer. They've generated a lot of&nbsp;discussion.</p><p>Overall, the results of that study were largely ambiguous, mostly due to some methodology challenges. There were different attrition rates between the households who received transfers and those who didn't, among other methodological challenges. But even though the results were pretty ambiguous, they're still an important input into the broader evidence landscape around cash transfers and UBI. And, luckily, GiveDirectly is doing many other RCTs and many other studies whose results will continue to inform this&nbsp;discussion.</p><p>When GiveDirectly and the researchers started the study, they designed the evaluation to answer some really important policy questions. They assigned households to three different groups, and that allowed them to figure out what happens to people who receive cash, people whose neighbors receive cash, and people whose communities are not exposed to cash at all. After looking at the three-year survey results, the researchers found that most of those positive impacts that I mentioned after 9 months had&nbsp;disappeared.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3TQSbNq16wKCesIAUUg0uG/4ec21aa2974673401ae7a5061a4522b4/UBI_Slide_5.png?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3TQSbNq16wKCesIAUUg0uG/4ec21aa2974673401ae7a5061a4522b4/UBI_Slide_5.png?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3TQSbNq16wKCesIAUUg0uG/4ec21aa2974673401ae7a5061a4522b4/UBI_Slide_5.png?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3TQSbNq16wKCesIAUUg0uG/4ec21aa2974673401ae7a5061a4522b4/UBI_Slide_5.png?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3TQSbNq16wKCesIAUUg0uG/4ec21aa2974673401ae7a5061a4522b4/UBI_Slide_5.png?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3TQSbNq16wKCesIAUUg0uG/4ec21aa2974673401ae7a5061a4522b4/UBI_Slide_5.png?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3TQSbNq16wKCesIAUUg0uG/4ec21aa2974673401ae7a5061a4522b4/UBI_Slide_5.png?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Households who had received the cash transfers did have more assets, but the impacts on consumption, investment, and happiness were no longer apparent. And there's also some suggestive evidence that households whose neighbors received cash, but who didn't receive cash themselves, experienced negative spillover effects, but again, this evidence is subject to some methodological questions, and we'll want to have more research on this question in the&nbsp;future.</p><p>Joe is going to tell you about some of the efforts that are currently ongoing to get more evidence on these questions in a little bit. But before he does, I want to return to one of the motivations behind UBI, which is reducing&nbsp;poverty.</p><p>We're not yet sure if basic income will lead to a sustainable increase to economic or non-economic wellbeing of the households living in extreme poverty. But while we wait for results, there is already evidence on one approach, which is targeted to households living on less than $1.90 a day, that can sustainably improve livelihoods. It's called the graduation approach, and it was initially designed and tested by BRAC, which is an NGO in&nbsp;Bangaladesh.</p><p>The graduation approach gives a transfer of a productive asset, which is meant to be the core of a small business. It also includes other complementary services, including coaching and consumption support, usually in the form of cash transfers. This is an actively managed program, in which households receive two years of support. JPAL-affiliated researchers have evaluated the program in Bangaladesh and in 6 other countries around the world, and found that overall the program had positive impacts on most measures of economic and non-economic wellbeing, both when the program ended, and a year later, after all the program support had ended. And in two sites, where it's been tested four years later - so, 7 years after the asset was transferred originally - there's evidence that consumption, income, assets, and psychosocial well-being all continued to improve. This suggests that the changes caused by this approach have lasting&nbsp;power.</p><p>Obviously, a program that involves all of these components is more expensive and more hands-on than delivering cash alone. So, researchers and implementers alike are really interested in figuring out whether the same good can be delivered in a less intensive version, or with fewer&nbsp;components.</p><p>In Ghana, researchers tested just the asset transfer alone, and in Uganda, researchers tested a cash transfer that was roughly equal to the cost of delivering a streamlined version of the graduation approach. And in both cases, they found that this sort of capital-infusion alone did not have the same positive effects on consumption, investment, or asset ownership. So, there seems to be something about the full package of the program that impacts households differently than capital alone&nbsp;can.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3NnCZi8NIcGeWcIcIyYg4C/a1c71c23662181ef651eb09189d33b65/UBI_Slide_6.png?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3NnCZi8NIcGeWcIcIyYg4C/a1c71c23662181ef651eb09189d33b65/UBI_Slide_6.png?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3NnCZi8NIcGeWcIcIyYg4C/a1c71c23662181ef651eb09189d33b65/UBI_Slide_6.png?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3NnCZi8NIcGeWcIcIyYg4C/a1c71c23662181ef651eb09189d33b65/UBI_Slide_6.png?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3NnCZi8NIcGeWcIcIyYg4C/a1c71c23662181ef651eb09189d33b65/UBI_Slide_6.png?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3NnCZi8NIcGeWcIcIyYg4C/a1c71c23662181ef651eb09189d33b65/UBI_Slide_6.png?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3NnCZi8NIcGeWcIcIyYg4C/a1c71c23662181ef651eb09189d33b65/UBI_Slide_6.png?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>So what does this mean, going back to the question of basic income? One interpretation is that households who are living in extreme poverty in lower and middle income countries face a number of pervasive market failures, like limited access to capital, limited information, and low trust in market institutions. The full package of graduation seems to be able to mitigate some of these market failures, in a way that cash alone may not be able to. So, in these contexts, we still need more evidence on whether cash transfers that are sufficiently large, or delivered for a sufficiently long duration, can overcome some of the barriers that existing evidence - that I just mentioned - have not been able&nbsp;to.</p><p>It also raises interesting questions about cash transfers in high income countries like the US. Here, the market failures I just mentioned are likely to be less pervasive, and less complex than they are in the countries where we're trying to reduce extreme poverty. But of course, we still need more research across contexts, to understand what impact something like a UBI will have on the household to receive&nbsp;it.</p><h1>Joe's Talk</h1><p>I'll start with saying that I'm really glad to be here. I originally found GiveDirectly through the effective altruism community, so conversations like these are very near and dear to my&nbsp;heart.</p><p>A core piece to start out with, when we're thinking about \"How would a universal basic income be different from some of the other things we already know about cash transfers\" gets into what's unique about a universal basic income - that particular structure of cash&nbsp;transfer.</p><p>First, it's universal. Whole communities are receiving the cash transfer, relative to targeting specific income levels or specific levels of vulnerability. So, you have a lot of variation in the types of recipient. It's not just business owners or people in extreme poverty. Instead, you have some variation in terms of whatever the communities look&nbsp;like.</p><p>Second, it's a particular amount: it's basic. It's sufficient to cover basic needs, which differs from some of what we already know about other sorts of cash transfer studies, which might be smaller, or big, one-time capital grants. It's a particular size of cash&nbsp;transfer.</p><p>Third, it's an income. It should be something you can rely on for your entire life, to provide a permanent cash floor, so that you're always up to a certain standard of living. In contrast to one-time grants, like what Haushofer and Shapiro studied, or grants targeted towards a particular life stage -like a pension, or support for people who have kids in secondary school - a universal basic income should follow you for your entire life, and provide long-term cash&nbsp;support.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3uJMaDpHCgIi68ASIkM4yU/f54e57cfcde0c7bcf0b78f3279742dad/UBI_Slide_7.png?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3uJMaDpHCgIi68ASIkM4yU/f54e57cfcde0c7bcf0b78f3279742dad/UBI_Slide_7.png?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3uJMaDpHCgIi68ASIkM4yU/f54e57cfcde0c7bcf0b78f3279742dad/UBI_Slide_7.png?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3uJMaDpHCgIi68ASIkM4yU/f54e57cfcde0c7bcf0b78f3279742dad/UBI_Slide_7.png?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3uJMaDpHCgIi68ASIkM4yU/f54e57cfcde0c7bcf0b78f3279742dad/UBI_Slide_7.png?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3uJMaDpHCgIi68ASIkM4yU/f54e57cfcde0c7bcf0b78f3279742dad/UBI_Slide_7.png?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3uJMaDpHCgIi68ASIkM4yU/f54e57cfcde0c7bcf0b78f3279742dad/UBI_Slide_7.png?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>So what do we know about that type of cash transfer? Well, from what Sam told you, there are a lot of studies of cash transfers broadly. Literally over 100 studies on cash transfers all over the world. And more particularly, there is a handful of studies that get grouped in specifically about universal basic&nbsp;income.</p><p>In the 60s and 70s, there was a wave of experiments in the US and Canada that tested a variant of a universal basic income called a negative income tax. From those - they typically weren't universal; they were targeted towards the poor. The experiments also weren't universal because there was a lottery-like system, choosing people randomly to participate in the studies. So you didn't get as much information on community-level effects. The studies were large, however, and usually they were basic: They provided a meaningful level of support. But they weren't typically long-term - usually just a few&nbsp;years.</p><p>What you saw from those studies is similar to what you see in a lot of the cash studies. First, people got money, and so they were mechanically less poor. And then you saw that flow through to more broad-based improvement. You saw educational attainment increase. In Canada, you saw hospitalization rates fall pretty markedly. One thing that's different from the Developed World studies that doesn't show up in the Developing World studies, is that you did see modest reductions in work effort. But where those showed up, they were showing up in populations where you might be more okay with people working less. They showed up in teenagers, who worked less and went to school more, and young mothers, just after giving&nbsp;birth.</p><p>Otherwise, there's a handful of studies in Namibia and Maja Pradesh in India, that looked at universal cash transfers. But, in Namibia it wasn't a randomized controlled trial, and didn't last for very long: only a couple of years. And in India, where they did use that experimental approach, it similarly didn't last very&nbsp;long.</p><p>Then, recently, as you've probably seen in the news, there's been an explosion of studies, basically all over the world. GiveDirectly has launched one in Kenya, there's one in Finland, there's one in the Netherlands. There's been demonstration projects, such as one called My Basic Income in Germany. And there's one coming up in Stockton, California as&nbsp;well.</p><p>Also, there's been two larger randomized controlled trials that are coming onboard. First, in Ontario, done by the provincial government there. And second, by YCombinator in California. Because these studies are expensive, researchers have typically made cost-benefit calculations to prioritize what they're studying. And so, almost none of these has been universal, in the sense of looking at whole communities. The YCombinator one isn't looking at whole communities, but they are looking at some income variation, and so they are doing their best to balance what they look&nbsp;into.</p><p>Another issue is that typically, cash transfer studies haven't gone that far out in terms of long-term, which might give you a question about whether that matters or not in interpreting&nbsp;them.</p><p>GiveDirectly took the approach of trying to design a study that would complement the existing body of research, including the body of research about cash transfers in general. So, our study is randomized at the village level. Whole communities will be treated differently, with about 44 villages receiving 12 years of monthly payments - about $23 - sized to sort of meet the poverty line in rural Kenya. That group of villages will be compared to villages receiving 2 years worth of basic income payments, and a group of villages receiving one-time cash grants of about $500 per adult. These one-time payments are roughly equal to the sum of the 2 years worth of payments elsewhere. Also, all three groups will be compared to a control&nbsp;group.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1rp3pLovT22AEM4KmoEuMA/9746deca95c172a2f46fce25622ddd9a/UBI_Slide_8.png?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1rp3pLovT22AEM4KmoEuMA/9746deca95c172a2f46fce25622ddd9a/UBI_Slide_8.png?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1rp3pLovT22AEM4KmoEuMA/9746deca95c172a2f46fce25622ddd9a/UBI_Slide_8.png?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1rp3pLovT22AEM4KmoEuMA/9746deca95c172a2f46fce25622ddd9a/UBI_Slide_8.png?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1rp3pLovT22AEM4KmoEuMA/9746deca95c172a2f46fce25622ddd9a/UBI_Slide_8.png?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1rp3pLovT22AEM4KmoEuMA/9746deca95c172a2f46fce25622ddd9a/UBI_Slide_8.png?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1rp3pLovT22AEM4KmoEuMA/9746deca95c172a2f46fce25622ddd9a/UBI_Slide_8.png?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>The research is being led by development economists, like Abhijit Banerjee, who founded JPAL, and Tavneet Suri, who is also director at JPAL, as well as Alan Krueger, who is the former chair of the Council of Economic Advisors for President Obama. We hope to bridge the policy worlds across the developing and developed&nbsp;world.</p><p>The actual surveying itself is being done by Innovations for Poverty Action, and we should have results out early next year, which is actually when we'll have an explosion of results out from GiveDirectly, Canada, and Finland&nbsp;too.</p><p>With studies like these, you want to look at a broad set of outcome variables. And so we're looking at both individual level outcome variables, in terms of earning or spending or assets, occupations and time-use, gender relations and risk-taking. At the individual level, how do those things evolve when UBI is introduced? We're also looking at community level effects, because there's something unique about this type of cash transfer, that everyone in society - or at least most of the people you're seeing day-to-day - are also receiving that cash transfer. We're looking at things like community level economic effects, access to health, education or water facilities, how things like community or political engagement evolve and how crime levels&nbsp;change.</p><p>Then, we'll look at both individual and community level effects relative to the differences in type of cash transfer. How it varies between the 12 year group of villages, and the 2 year group, which should help inform how we should think about other studies, that are relatively shorter term, as well as the structure of how cash grants achieve different goals or different outcomes versus recurring stream&nbsp;payments.</p><p>And then, because it's universal, we have a rich set of data of different types of people receiving a cash transfer, and then seeing if they spend it differently. How do different starting-income groups spend cash differently? How about different age groups, or genders? This information should help inform broader policy questions beyond just those about&nbsp;UBI.</p><p>So, how should the effective altruist community think about all this? I think there's a few different types of questions the community should try to&nbsp;answer:</p><p>The first one is what will be the direct impact of these cash transfers? For this, we have rich data on other types of cash transfers, from literally all over the world, where, if you give cash to people who don't have it, they are immediately a little bit less poor, because they have cash, and you start to see that flow-through into broader wellbeing: things like increased consumption, or increased assets and earnings. You also see it show up more indirectly, like reduced stress or improved psychological&nbsp;wellbeing.</p><p>In Malawi, you saw women whose families received small, recurring payments get pregnant later, marry later, and have lower rates of HIV, because they had a little bit more security in society. And so, part of the bet on effective altruism, is a bet on how it'll differ from other types of cash transfers. Which we can maybe dig into in the&nbsp;Q&amp;A.</p><p>The second answer we should anticipate, is what the broader policy impact of this type of study will be. And this applies to any of the - I think it's 12 - studies that GiveDirectly is doing. To give you one example of what the policy potential of our universal basic income study, this graph is taken from an estimate by the government of India, where they modeled what might happen if they replaced existing subsidy programs with a modest universal basic income, essentially universally. It shows what that change would do to poverty in&nbsp;India.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5zNKmFCOhaow6e6cCsMWW4/feb4c699715c31f5c6d7b1d09ff39477/UBI_Slide_9.png?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5zNKmFCOhaow6e6cCsMWW4/feb4c699715c31f5c6d7b1d09ff39477/UBI_Slide_9.png?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5zNKmFCOhaow6e6cCsMWW4/feb4c699715c31f5c6d7b1d09ff39477/UBI_Slide_9.png?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5zNKmFCOhaow6e6cCsMWW4/feb4c699715c31f5c6d7b1d09ff39477/UBI_Slide_9.png?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5zNKmFCOhaow6e6cCsMWW4/feb4c699715c31f5c6d7b1d09ff39477/UBI_Slide_9.png?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5zNKmFCOhaow6e6cCsMWW4/feb4c699715c31f5c6d7b1d09ff39477/UBI_Slide_9.png?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5zNKmFCOhaow6e6cCsMWW4/feb4c699715c31f5c6d7b1d09ff39477/UBI_Slide_9.png?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>What they estimated was that it would take poverty from about 22% to 0.45%. Literally bringing over 100 million people out of poverty, basically immediately. That doesn't necessarily mean that that's what we should do: there's an opportunity cost for this type of spending. There might be other effects of the cash transfer that are worth studying. But it gives you a sense of the potential scale of policy implications of this type of research, beyond the 21,000 people who are receiving cash from GiveDirectly in the&nbsp;shorter-term.</p><p>The third question for the effective altruism community to try to predict is more foundational. We want to look at the process that we mostly apply, at least for effective altruism, to help existing poor people today. Where it looks like the following&nbsp;process:</p><ol><li>Choosing a set of outcomes that we think are important, such as earnings, health, or how long people&nbsp;live;</li><li>Choosing goods and services that we think would improve those outcomes, whether it's a graduation program or a deworming pill, or a&nbsp;goat;</li><li>Choosing providers who we think can deliver those goods and services as best they can.<br>I think a lot of what the effective altruism community is focused on is doing this process better than how aid and development have traditionally done it&nbsp;before.</li></ol><p>What I think is helpful about cash transfers is they pose a more foundational question of who should make these choices, and what types of outcomes are important. We want to examine how you value earnings, or not getting rained on, or being a little bit extra healthy. How you value improvements in the lives of your children. The existing status quo is, donors and funders start with a pool of money, and almost by virtue of that, they become the choosers for how it gets used. But cash transfers literally put the budget in charge of the people we're trying to help, and lets them make those&nbsp;choices.</p><p>I think that switch of power is important, in part just because of practical reasons. There's a tale of two track records where the poor have over 100 studies backing up the quality of their decision making when they control their own budgets. And then, the funders, implementers, have the track record of whatever you think about the last 50 years of development&nbsp;history.</p><p>Now, it's a genuinely tricky problem to figure out what types of outcomes matter. In part, this is because people are very, very different. We see GiveDirectly recipients buy an incredibly diverse array of things. We've seen solar panels, livestock, roofs, and even someone deciding to start a band. There's an incredible diversity in humans. And that's amplified by the fact that most of the decision making is done by people in San Francisco, New York, DC or London. And it's on behalf of people who are living in places like rural Western Kenya. Doing the relevant calculations - which we can try to do better, as effective altruists - is inherently very, very&nbsp;difficult.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1IfzdaxnGUKq6CmccIUUYW/f7e21eae784eb8effac0d93754e71493/UBI_Slide_10.png?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1IfzdaxnGUKq6CmccIUUYW/f7e21eae784eb8effac0d93754e71493/UBI_Slide_10.png?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1IfzdaxnGUKq6CmccIUUYW/f7e21eae784eb8effac0d93754e71493/UBI_Slide_10.png?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1IfzdaxnGUKq6CmccIUUYW/f7e21eae784eb8effac0d93754e71493/UBI_Slide_10.png?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1IfzdaxnGUKq6CmccIUUYW/f7e21eae784eb8effac0d93754e71493/UBI_Slide_10.png?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1IfzdaxnGUKq6CmccIUUYW/f7e21eae784eb8effac0d93754e71493/UBI_Slide_10.png?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1IfzdaxnGUKq6CmccIUUYW/f7e21eae784eb8effac0d93754e71493/UBI_Slide_10.png?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Which is not to say that the entire development aid portfolio should shift towards recipient-chosen, or recipient-decided, but existing portfolios are extremely skewed the other way. Basically, any way you cut it, whether you look at humanitarian aid, or institutional aid given by governments, or US international charitable giving, basically the whole pots of money meant to help the poor are decided by the rich. This is an unintuitive result, given what we've talked about before. So I think one of the most helpful things that cash transfers can do, with UBI being an example of this, is force the effective altruism community to answer that more foundational question of who should decide which outcomes matter, and what types of goods and services best achieve those&nbsp;outcomes.</p><h1>Q&amp;A</h1><p><strong>Question:</strong> Negative spillovers when some people in the village get money and others don't: what does that look like? How does somebody's life get worse in that&nbsp;situation?</p><p><strong>Sam:</strong> Researchers have done a little bit of work to try to understand what this means. There's one paper that they've released, which finds that there might be some negative implications on people's wellbeing. So, people might feel more stressed or depressed, if their neighbor is receiving cash and they aren't. In the 2018 paper, which is the 3 year results that I mentioned, the researchers posit that households that didn't receive cash were selling off assets, so they ended up owning fewer assets. Households who did receive cash, as I mentioned, had more assets at the&nbsp;end.</p><p><strong>Joe:</strong> Yeah. I think the 3 year study is one that's genuinely hard to interpret, because of the methodological things which we can dig into. It's a tricky study to synthesize and know what to do about. In 2014, we launched a study specifically geared to answering this question in a high-quality way: The question of how non-recipients of cash get impacted by being near recipients of cash. We randomized the concentration of cash transfer delivered in different regions. That way, we can really highlight how people are affected. That study will have results out around August or September this&nbsp;year.</p><p>I think the other question for the effective altruism community is how those results, in part, can inform research design, about how you should approach individually randomized studies where people are very close to each other. For GiveDirectly's programming, we've moved very, very far away from hand-picking individuals from communities. In general, we've moved much more towards enrolling almost everyone. That's literally the case for the UBI study, but even for our day-to-day programming, we're moving much towards saturating villages. And so it's a little bit harder to know, without seeing the other study, which will look across villages as well, how to draw the right conclusions from that 3 year study for what we do&nbsp;today.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> A clarification question. When you mention the graduation program, the concept of asset transfer, I'm picturing a cow. Is that the right image for me to have in&nbsp;mind?</p><p><strong>Sam:</strong> Yeah, so the graduation program is always tailored to whatever context where it's being implemented. Usually it's livestock, but it can also be supplies to open up a small shop and sell berets, or makeup, or cigarettes, whatever makes sense for the&nbsp;community.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> What are the challenges of running a study that's going to go on for 12 years? Things are going to change in the world around you. I mean, it's always hard to hold things constant, but, in that span of time, it gets even more difficult. How do you think about those&nbsp;challenges?</p><p><strong>Joe:</strong> Yeah, it's tricky. You have to guess what you think your follow-up call center will cost in 2029, for example. You have to figure out how to manage the cash between Kenyan banks and US banks, to maintain a standard payment across those 12 years. You have to think about how to increase the transfer's size with inflation. It's a bunch of really hard questions, that we're trying to be pretty paranoid about, in terms of playing out different scenarios. If GiveDirectly got shut down in Kenya for whatever reason, could we continue payments if we wanted to? Things like that. We have a bunch of specific answers to those little questions, but it required a decent amount of&nbsp;work.</p><p>The nice thing is once you get past this hurdle - we've now enrolled 21,000 people - it's a steadier state. The picture looks like: once a month we send out payments, and people receive text messages, and then once every few months we have our call center call them. So that's a much lighter level of engagement, that we have to keep up for the next decade or so. So that piece of it is a lot easier than the initial lift to get all those people&nbsp;enrolled.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> When you think about the tradeoffs between a negative income tax and the universal basic income, why give the universal basic income to everyone? For those that don't need it, it seems wasteful. How about the universal the non-universal negative income tax, as an&nbsp;alternative?</p><p><strong>Joe:</strong> One thing I should note is, you can achieve pretty similar distributions of incomes post-tax, as in post-transfers, with either negative income tax or UBI. Because with a UBI, if you give Bill Gates his $12,000 a year, you end up taxing it back. And so you can end up with the same distributions for both settings. I think the tradeoffs become in part political: what's more palatable? Sometimes it's easier to say, let's give cash to the poor. Other times, it might be easier to get people on board with universal support, that's, everyone's dividend is part of being in society. Other people also argue, which I'm looking forward to seeing, that there's something helpful about the cash support being universal, so that it's not stigmatizing. That it's not just the dole for the poor. If it's less that and more a universal floor for everybody, you might think that in part politically it's easier to maintain, but also maybe it has different effects. That people don't view it as support they get for being poor, but rather, not deserving to starve as part of the societal bargain more generally. And that may have different sorts of effects in terms of how UBI is spent. Or maybe it will be spent more communally. Those are among the things we'll try to&nbsp;test.</p>", "user": {"username": "The Centre for Effective Altruism"}}, {"_id": "JbJSt6Aap3EYzNqvX", "title": "Stefan Schubert: Why aren't people donating more effectively?", "postedAt": "2018-06-08T07:15:00.000Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QyvzbW0XKmY&amp;list=PLwp9xeoX5p8P3cDQwlyN7qsFhC9Ms4L5W&amp;index=13\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/QyvzbW0XKmY\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><hr><p><i>In this talk from EA Global 2018: San Francisco, Dr. Stefan Schubert discusses the psychology of charitable giving.

I'll be presenting joint work that I'm pursuing together with my colleague Lucius Caviola, who is a PhD student at Oxford University, under the leadership of Nadira Faber, who is the head of the Social Behaviour and Ethics Lab, where we&nbsp;work.</p><h2>The puzzle of ineffective&nbsp;giving</h2><p>The puzzle of ineffective giving is that people donate large sums to charity, which is evidence that they actually want to help others. And yet, a large proportion of donations are very ineffective, at least if effective altruists are right. Donating very ineffectively seems to defeat the very purpose of giving. The donations aren't actually helping others, at least not nearly as much as they could. So, we have a puzzle, which gives rise to my first question: \"Why don't people donate effectively?\" And after that, my second question: \"How can we make people donate more&nbsp;effectively?\"</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3CgtGz0ROw44kGSSs8A2ac/8bfa8161c7021cfd5d9ee4917d4daebe/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_1.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3CgtGz0ROw44kGSSs8A2ac/8bfa8161c7021cfd5d9ee4917d4daebe/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_1.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3CgtGz0ROw44kGSSs8A2ac/8bfa8161c7021cfd5d9ee4917d4daebe/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_1.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3CgtGz0ROw44kGSSs8A2ac/8bfa8161c7021cfd5d9ee4917d4daebe/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_1.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3CgtGz0ROw44kGSSs8A2ac/8bfa8161c7021cfd5d9ee4917d4daebe/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_1.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3CgtGz0ROw44kGSSs8A2ac/8bfa8161c7021cfd5d9ee4917d4daebe/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_1.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3CgtGz0ROw44kGSSs8A2ac/8bfa8161c7021cfd5d9ee4917d4daebe/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_1.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>I'll first focus on the 'why' question. There are two main explanations. The first is that people don't donate effectively because they actually don't really want to. Instead of effectiveness, they have some other goal with their giving, such as trying to obtain some positive emotion or improve their reputation. We'll call this the preference-based&nbsp;explanation.</p><p>The second main explanation is that people <i>want</i> to donate effectively, but they don't know how. They suffer from false beliefs or cognitive biases or something like that. We'll call this the belief-based explanation. So on one hand we have preference-based explanations and on the other hand we have belief-based&nbsp;explanations.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Qqdi2u9kQ6qsCsKWw4Cia/0eff1f4f790c391ad153ad1444b0e8d9/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_2.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Qqdi2u9kQ6qsCsKWw4Cia/0eff1f4f790c391ad153ad1444b0e8d9/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_2.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Qqdi2u9kQ6qsCsKWw4Cia/0eff1f4f790c391ad153ad1444b0e8d9/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_2.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Qqdi2u9kQ6qsCsKWw4Cia/0eff1f4f790c391ad153ad1444b0e8d9/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_2.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Qqdi2u9kQ6qsCsKWw4Cia/0eff1f4f790c391ad153ad1444b0e8d9/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_2.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Qqdi2u9kQ6qsCsKWw4Cia/0eff1f4f790c391ad153ad1444b0e8d9/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_2.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Qqdi2u9kQ6qsCsKWw4Cia/0eff1f4f790c391ad153ad1444b0e8d9/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_2.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>In this talk, I will provide some evidence for both of these different explanations, and in particular I'll present some research of our own which pertains primarily to the belief-based explanations. But I'll start by focusing on the preference based explanations, and delve a little bit more deeply into&nbsp;them.</p><h2>Preference-based explanations</h2><p>There are two kinds of preference based explanations, on our conceptualization. The first has to do with \"warm glow\". It says that when people are donating, they're optimizing for warm glow rather than&nbsp;effectiveness.</p><p>Warm glow is a positive emotion that people obtain from showing empathy or generosity. In particular, people obtain warm glow from giving spontaneously, and a bit capriciously, which is obviously not something that is very conducive to effectiveness. So, therefore, warm glow giving often tends not to be very&nbsp;effective.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5mKejWVhLiqWgQg6meSuM4/6062d9e080c18a5225de4286bf7dcf7c/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_3.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5mKejWVhLiqWgQg6meSuM4/6062d9e080c18a5225de4286bf7dcf7c/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_3.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5mKejWVhLiqWgQg6meSuM4/6062d9e080c18a5225de4286bf7dcf7c/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_3.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5mKejWVhLiqWgQg6meSuM4/6062d9e080c18a5225de4286bf7dcf7c/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_3.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5mKejWVhLiqWgQg6meSuM4/6062d9e080c18a5225de4286bf7dcf7c/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_3.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5mKejWVhLiqWgQg6meSuM4/6062d9e080c18a5225de4286bf7dcf7c/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_3.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5mKejWVhLiqWgQg6meSuM4/6062d9e080c18a5225de4286bf7dcf7c/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_3.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Another preference based explanation has to do with reputation, or signaling. People signal certain traits in order to improve their reputation. On this model, when people donate, third parties observe and judge them. So people want to give in a way that will earn them a favorable judgment. If third parties judge our character traits, and if it's the case that we, for instance, display spontaneous empathy, then people tend to make the judgment: \"this is a good person\", and reward that, whereas they may not reward effective donations to the same&nbsp;extent.</p><p>I should also clarify that the warm glow giving explanation and the reputational signaling explanation aren't necessarily mutually exclusive. When people are engaging in signaling behavior, they may very well at the same time obtain the warm&nbsp;glow.</p><p>Let's briefly cover some evidence of warm glow&nbsp;giving.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/52HEx2xZockgqu0uC62GI4/821d53df81a7fce72b36befd78a85af6/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_4.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/52HEx2xZockgqu0uC62GI4/821d53df81a7fce72b36befd78a85af6/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_4.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/52HEx2xZockgqu0uC62GI4/821d53df81a7fce72b36befd78a85af6/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_4.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/52HEx2xZockgqu0uC62GI4/821d53df81a7fce72b36befd78a85af6/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_4.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/52HEx2xZockgqu0uC62GI4/821d53df81a7fce72b36befd78a85af6/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_4.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/52HEx2xZockgqu0uC62GI4/821d53df81a7fce72b36befd78a85af6/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_4.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/52HEx2xZockgqu0uC62GI4/821d53df81a7fce72b36befd78a85af6/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_4.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>There is one paper that was recently published in Psychological Science - a prestigious psychology journal - where it was shown that people donate to pet projects, or projects that they feel strongly about, even when told that other charities or other projects are more effective. In the paper, they were told that arthritis research is more effective than cancer research, and still the majority chose to donate to cancer&nbsp;research.</p><p>As evidence for signaling or reputation-based giving, it has been shown by a number of effective altruism-aligned researchers that deliberate donors are seen as having a worse moral character than donors who give spontaneously and empathetically. In that case, no wonder people donate spontaneously rather than&nbsp;deliberately!</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/66TLkZ46XK0SqMqGi6g2gA/b72765028f3e8d0d4af3d864b22c930c/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_5.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/66TLkZ46XK0SqMqGi6g2gA/b72765028f3e8d0d4af3d864b22c930c/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_5.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/66TLkZ46XK0SqMqGi6g2gA/b72765028f3e8d0d4af3d864b22c930c/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_5.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/66TLkZ46XK0SqMqGi6g2gA/b72765028f3e8d0d4af3d864b22c930c/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_5.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/66TLkZ46XK0SqMqGi6g2gA/b72765028f3e8d0d4af3d864b22c930c/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_5.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/66TLkZ46XK0SqMqGi6g2gA/b72765028f3e8d0d4af3d864b22c930c/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_5.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/66TLkZ46XK0SqMqGi6g2gA/b72765028f3e8d0d4af3d864b22c930c/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_5.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>If the problem is that people prefer to give in ineffective ways, what can we do to improve their giving and make it more effective? Well, one thing that we can do is to try to change the norms and culture of giving. Specifically, we may try to improve the third parties' judgments so that they don't reward ineffective giving, but rather reward effective giving. Here, there are two strategies. One is to try to improve everyone's judgments. So, to get everyone on board with effective giving and get everyone to reward other people donating effectively. However, that may not be tractable, because many people seem to not have a disposition in favor of effective giving. So another approach might be to selectively pick those people who already have views which are conducive to effective giving, bring them together, and form an effectiveness-minded culture where everyone is rewarding everyone else for donating effectively. And to some extent that seems to be exactly what the effective altruist community is doing, sort of re-rewarding each other for donating effectively, rather than spontaneously and&nbsp;capriciously.</p><h2>Belief-based explanations</h2><p>Belief-based explanations also come in different forms. One has to do with cognitive biases - there are many biases which affect the effectiveness of giving. One very well known bias is scope neglect, which is that people tend often to be insensitive to the size of the opportunity to help. In a well known study, one group of people was asked how much they would donate to help 200 birds, and another group was asked how much they would donate to help 2000 birds. The two groups chose to donate similar amounts, even though in the second case they could help ten times more. This seems to be a fairly pervasive phenomenon, which obviously reduces the effectiveness of&nbsp;donations.</p><p>Another kind of bias has to do with people often focusing on overhead or administration costs, rather than effectiveness, when they evaluate different charities. This is something that Lucius has published a paper on, together with his colleagues, which I will present in some detail in a minute.

One potential false belief about the effectiveness of various charities might be, for instance, that charities just don't differ much in terms of effectiveness. This is something we've actually started studying, so I will present a study of relevance for this in a minute. Another potential false belief is that differences in effectiveness are mostly driven by differences regarding overhead ratios, or that charity effectiveness can't be&nbsp;measured.</p><p>So, if it's the case that people suffer from these kinds of false beliefs, and it is also the case that this is something that drives ineffective giving, then it seems like we might be able to perform a straightforward intervention. We can just inform people that their misconceptions are misconceptions in order to dispel them, and so, perhaps, improve donation behavior. I will talk more about that later in this talk. But now let's move onto our own&nbsp;research.</p><h2>Research and results</h2><p>There's this paper from 2014 by Lucius and his colleagues on overhead aversion. The issue here is that when donors are evaluating charities, they might use different criteria. One is overhead ratio, meaning the percentage of money that goes into administration. Another is cost effectiveness, meaning the positive outcome per dollar donated. For instance, the number of lives saved. And, of course, effective altruists think that what one should look at is cost effectiveness, but in fact people often look at overhead ratio instead. So, why is that? Well one reason might be that in separate evaluation, as psychologists say, when you're just presented with an individual option - in this case, an individual charity - separately, it can be very hard to evaluate the relative effectiveness of a charity if you don't know anything about&nbsp;effectiveness.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4J3hkLggKkiUICqyssEsoO/3fdaf3464cd7556f0a2fde580f97f31d/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_7.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4J3hkLggKkiUICqyssEsoO/3fdaf3464cd7556f0a2fde580f97f31d/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_7.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4J3hkLggKkiUICqyssEsoO/3fdaf3464cd7556f0a2fde580f97f31d/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_7.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4J3hkLggKkiUICqyssEsoO/3fdaf3464cd7556f0a2fde580f97f31d/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_7.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4J3hkLggKkiUICqyssEsoO/3fdaf3464cd7556f0a2fde580f97f31d/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_7.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4J3hkLggKkiUICqyssEsoO/3fdaf3464cd7556f0a2fde580f97f31d/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_7.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4J3hkLggKkiUICqyssEsoO/3fdaf3464cd7556f0a2fde580f97f31d/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_7.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>For example, how effective is a charity that saves, say, a hundred lives for a million dollars? There is no intuitive way to tell. Whereas if you're being told that a charity has a 50 percent overhead ratio, you can immediately grasp that this is a high level of overhead. So for that reason, people often focus on overhead in separate evaluation. Or at least, this was Lucius and his colleagues' hypothesis. They ran a study when they had two different charities, one charity which had a higher level of overhead and a higher level of effectiveness than the other charity. And then they compared them in two modes, as it were. One was separate, where participants were only given the opportunity to donate - or not - to charity A, or were given the same opportunity for charity B, but not both. And then there was also joint evaluation, where a third group was presented with the opportunity to either donate to charity A or to charity&nbsp;B.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2nEzN8duR2gA4IOuGicw60/0a3c102be651b539ed5b1c657013ef42/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_8.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2nEzN8duR2gA4IOuGicw60/0a3c102be651b539ed5b1c657013ef42/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_8.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2nEzN8duR2gA4IOuGicw60/0a3c102be651b539ed5b1c657013ef42/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_8.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2nEzN8duR2gA4IOuGicw60/0a3c102be651b539ed5b1c657013ef42/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_8.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2nEzN8duR2gA4IOuGicw60/0a3c102be651b539ed5b1c657013ef42/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_8.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2nEzN8duR2gA4IOuGicw60/0a3c102be651b539ed5b1c657013ef42/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_8.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2nEzN8duR2gA4IOuGicw60/0a3c102be651b539ed5b1c657013ef42/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_8.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>The hypothesis predicted that in separate evaluation, people would go for the low overhead charity, on aggregate, because it would be easier to evaluate. Whereas in joint evaluation, the hypothesis predicted that the group would be able to compare both effectiveness and the overhead, they would realize that effectiveness is what really matters, and therefore they would go for the more effective charity. This hypothesis was supported by the&nbsp;data.</p><p>So, based on this study, it seems that people do focus on effectiveness when charities are appropriately comparable. They don't do so when they're just presented with the individual charities, but they do so when charities are appropriately comparable. So the policy implication might be that we should increase the comparability of charities. We should present multiple charities at the same time, and make it easy to compare relative cost&nbsp;effectiveness.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6oukrNSxe8KmwGYIooE4EY/41245c256a6340ff0c3638cf03aff45e/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_9.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6oukrNSxe8KmwGYIooE4EY/41245c256a6340ff0c3638cf03aff45e/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_9.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6oukrNSxe8KmwGYIooE4EY/41245c256a6340ff0c3638cf03aff45e/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_9.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6oukrNSxe8KmwGYIooE4EY/41245c256a6340ff0c3638cf03aff45e/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_9.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6oukrNSxe8KmwGYIooE4EY/41245c256a6340ff0c3638cf03aff45e/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_9.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6oukrNSxe8KmwGYIooE4EY/41245c256a6340ff0c3638cf03aff45e/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_9.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6oukrNSxe8KmwGYIooE4EY/41245c256a6340ff0c3638cf03aff45e/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_9.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Let's move on to another study that we're currently running, that rather has to do with the misconception about charity effectiveness and specifically, that has to do with misconceptions about the variance of effectiveness across different charities.

This is something that Spencer Greenberg already studied in a pilot study, and the result there was that the median ratio was 1.6. This is much lower than what EAs think, so we wanted to replicate this finding and publish it in an academic journal.

This supports Spencer's earlier findings, too. But informing people about relative effectiveness doesn't make a big difference to their giving behavior. So, what might be the explanation? Well, one possibility is that getting rid of one misconception might not be sufficient because of additional obstacles. So, for instance, the preference to split donations might be very strong, or there might be some sort of scope insensitivity factor which has an effect&nbsp;here.</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><p>To sum up: I had two questions. One was: \"why don't people donate effectively?\" There were two responses to that. One was they don't want to - that was the preference based explanation - and the second was they want to but they don't know how - that was the belief based explanation. So far, we haven't amassed enough evidence to say which one of these is the more important, so more research is needed. And on the second question, \"how can we make people donate more effectively?\" Well, the response to that question will depend on what the response to the first question is. So if the preference-based explanation is right, then we saw that better norms might be one way to go, whereas if the belief-based explanation is right, then better framings which don't trigger cognitive biases might be the way to&nbsp;go.</p><p>For instance, we saw that increasing the comparability of different charities might help people to avoid cognitive biases. Another approach might be just to inform people in order to dispel misconceptions, and then hope this will improve their donation behavior. But in the study that we ran, we saw that this didn't have that much of an effect and we speculated that this might be because there are some additional misconceptions which present additional obstacles to effective&nbsp;giving.</p><p>In light of our findings, of there being many misconceptions and it being very difficult, perhaps, to fix them all, we might wonder if there is some kind of hack by which we can circumvent all of these different misconceptions. One such hack might be to encourage deference to experts: Rather than having people figuring out for themselves all the relevant factors for assessing the relative effectiveness of different charities, we just have them defer to experts. This is a model which has a great precedent in science. So in science, I am ignorant about scientific facts in many fields, but I can still act on scientific knowledge appropriately because I defer to scientific experts, or&nbsp;scientists.</p><p>This model seems to work very well in science, so perhaps this is the way to go also with respect to charitable giving,&nbsp;too.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5wlWQt9DoIUWY6cKACuqYs/44cbce11fbac266452f4c7b6b7863e45/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_15.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5wlWQt9DoIUWY6cKACuqYs/44cbce11fbac266452f4c7b6b7863e45/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_15.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5wlWQt9DoIUWY6cKACuqYs/44cbce11fbac266452f4c7b6b7863e45/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_15.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5wlWQt9DoIUWY6cKACuqYs/44cbce11fbac266452f4c7b6b7863e45/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_15.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5wlWQt9DoIUWY6cKACuqYs/44cbce11fbac266452f4c7b6b7863e45/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_15.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5wlWQt9DoIUWY6cKACuqYs/44cbce11fbac266452f4c7b6b7863e45/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_15.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5wlWQt9DoIUWY6cKACuqYs/44cbce11fbac266452f4c7b6b7863e45/Psychology_of_EA_Slide_15.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>If you want to run studies in these fields or have study ideas, please contact us.

They don't necessarily have to be severe; 2009 H1N1 was a mild pandemic, but it was still a pandemic. An <i>epidemic</i> is an infectious disease outbreak that occurs over a large number of individuals within a population. So, the SARS outbreak in 2003 would be an epidemic. An <i>endemic</i> is something that occurs regularly within a population. For example, the common cold is endemic in the human population. Those are just things to keep in mind. What we're talking about are specific types of pandemics that are very severe, to meet GCBR&nbsp;criteria.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3BRfgDKeiAKKW2KyCAoskI/9fca93b261ab581c43da4e7c96cc6f60/Pathogen_Slide3.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3BRfgDKeiAKKW2KyCAoskI/9fca93b261ab581c43da4e7c96cc6f60/Pathogen_Slide3.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3BRfgDKeiAKKW2KyCAoskI/9fca93b261ab581c43da4e7c96cc6f60/Pathogen_Slide3.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3BRfgDKeiAKKW2KyCAoskI/9fca93b261ab581c43da4e7c96cc6f60/Pathogen_Slide3.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3BRfgDKeiAKKW2KyCAoskI/9fca93b261ab581c43da4e7c96cc6f60/Pathogen_Slide3.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3BRfgDKeiAKKW2KyCAoskI/9fca93b261ab581c43da4e7c96cc6f60/Pathogen_Slide3.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3BRfgDKeiAKKW2KyCAoskI/9fca93b261ab581c43da4e7c96cc6f60/Pathogen_Slide3.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>I'm not going to spend much time on this definition because Crystal really went into some great detail, but what I'm going to do is expand on what's special about certain biological agents, and what types of biological agents can cause GCBRs. Everybody is very focused on viruses, some people are focused on bacteria, some people on other things, so what I'm trying to understand is what traits does a biological agent have to have in order to be able to cause something this severe, to cause this massive catastrophic loss of life, disruption of society,&nbsp;etc.</p><p>I just want to draw a distinction, because what I'm talking about here are pathogens of pandemic potential, versus just critically regionally important, a distinction made in Mike Osterholm's recent book. When you have an outbreak like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, just because it's not a GCBR doesn't mean it's not important or that it's not going to be very disruptive to people's lives, to societies and to governments. But what we're talking about in a GCBR is something that's going to be global, like the 1918 flu. Something that's a lot different in scale than even Middle East Respiratory Syndrome or SARS. Something much different. There's lots of pathogens of critical regional importance. Even the Ebola outbreak in 2014 in West Africa falls under the criteria for critical regional importance, versus&nbsp;GCBR.</p><p>The specific aim with this project was really to, like I said, move away from a list-based historical approach. People had really just taken the Soviet Union Biological Weapons program and added a couple things here and there, but really hadn't thought much about why each thing was on there. They hadn't really challenged the assumptions that put them on there, and really try to understand certain questions. What it was that made smallpox so scary? What is it that makes pandemic flu so scary? We're really trying to go into an inductive manner, trying to make a whole new paradigm, looking at the actual attributes of GCBRs. We tried to do this by being totally <i>microbignostic</i>. What I say microbignostic, that means we didn't go into this project saying, \"This has to be a virus. This has to be a bacterium\". We said it could be anything. It could be a parasite, a protozoa, it could be a prion. So that was something that was totally new. We really wanted to challenge thinking and then take this paradigm, and hopefully use it to move forward when we think about preparedness and try and think of new infectious disease outbreaks with this new paradigm in mind, to get better at being prepared because we're constantly surprised, which I'll get to later in the&nbsp;talk.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1wULgaJ14sw06AIsiMgGOA/2367a06e8bf2c86e6b8c356209be4794/Pathogen_Slide4.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1wULgaJ14sw06AIsiMgGOA/2367a06e8bf2c86e6b8c356209be4794/Pathogen_Slide4.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1wULgaJ14sw06AIsiMgGOA/2367a06e8bf2c86e6b8c356209be4794/Pathogen_Slide4.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1wULgaJ14sw06AIsiMgGOA/2367a06e8bf2c86e6b8c356209be4794/Pathogen_Slide4.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1wULgaJ14sw06AIsiMgGOA/2367a06e8bf2c86e6b8c356209be4794/Pathogen_Slide4.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1wULgaJ14sw06AIsiMgGOA/2367a06e8bf2c86e6b8c356209be4794/Pathogen_Slide4.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1wULgaJ14sw06AIsiMgGOA/2367a06e8bf2c86e6b8c356209be4794/Pathogen_Slide4.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>What are the essential traits? The next slide is a little busy, so I'm going to walk through it one by one. We think about what a GCBR have to have. We talk to people and do a lot of literature review; there's a whole bunch of different things that make up the alchemy of a pandemic pathogen. I'm going try and explain what this equation means as best I&nbsp;can.</p><p>The first thing you need to do, is you have to have a pathogen that can efficiently transmit from human to human. You can have a disease that can be really bad, like tetanus. But since tetanus doesn't transmit between humans, so it can't be a pandemic pathogen. When you're talking about a pandemic pathogen, it has to be able to get from people to people, so that's number&nbsp;one.</p><p>It has to have a moderate fatality rate. It doesn't have to be really, really horrible like a 90% fatality rate or 100% like rabies. It has to be something that's kind of in a sweet spot that it allows enough death to occur that it causes disruption in the society. Remember that the 1918 influenza pandemic, which killed 50 to 100 million people, only had a fatality rate of two percent. But because it was so widespread, it led to&nbsp;disruption.</p><p>Contagious during incubation period. I have bolded this because in multiple modeling studies, and in experience - and Crystal alluded to this earlier when she talked about smallpox - if a disease is contagious during the incubation period, when you're not sick, then it's very, very hard to control. That's why the H1N1 pandemic had spread everywhere before anybody even knew about it because people were contagious one day before symptoms. If a disease is contagious in that period, it becomes very, very difficult for public health interventions to have any impact. The same goes with mild illnesses with contagiousness. When you have the flu or the common cold and you're out shopping, doing your normal daily life, you spread that to other people. It's very hard to stop that, versus something like Ebola, when you're sick and highly contagious you are in bed and you can't really move, and move about in society. So this is another key&nbsp;factor.</p><p>An immunologically na\u00efve population. Again, reflecting back on Crystal's talk when she showed the map of the indigenous populations in the Americas, in the pre-Columbian area in 1492. That was an immunologically na\u00efve population to smallpox, which allowed smallpox to spread very rapidly through that population. That's what a pandemic pathogen would&nbsp;require.</p><p>No vaccine or treatment. You don't have any way to stop this. That's another thing that fits into&nbsp;GCBRs.</p><p>Correct atmospheric and environmental context. Infectious diseases happen in a context. Is it happening during World War I like the pandemic flu did in 1918? Is it happening where there's been societal disruption? Like, for example, Yemen right now and the cholera outbreaks? All of that's going to play a major role in how prolific an infectious disease outbreak&nbsp;is.</p><p>There's a lot of biology that has to go into this too. Not every pathogen can infect every type of human. You have to have a proper receptor. So you've got to have some receptor that lots of humans have that this virus or this bacteria can actually cling onto. It's also going to explain which organs it affects, because obviously some organs are more important. If it affects your brain, your kidney, your liver, your lungs, those are what you really see with these pandemic pathogens. And then it has to be able to evade the host immune response. It has to be something that is not easy for the immune system to mount an effective response&nbsp;against.</p><p>This is a fancy equation that showed up. The point of this equation is not to memorize it or to think about it, it's just that you can take all of these things and give them values, and come up with the pandemic potential of a pathogen. You can look and vary them. You can look at some other things too. For example, the more host types a pathogen has, the more chance it is to emerge. That's another thing that comes up, that these things can infect more than one type of species. That's where the concept of zoonosis comes about, where something comes from an animal species into humans. But the more hosts something has, the more likely it is to be able to infect humans and cause a&nbsp;problem.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1J3iulzVDm6SoaA8ImMAei/1e0ada9ca22b2ea9229597535be0dbf3/Pathogen_Slide5.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1J3iulzVDm6SoaA8ImMAei/1e0ada9ca22b2ea9229597535be0dbf3/Pathogen_Slide5.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1J3iulzVDm6SoaA8ImMAei/1e0ada9ca22b2ea9229597535be0dbf3/Pathogen_Slide5.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1J3iulzVDm6SoaA8ImMAei/1e0ada9ca22b2ea9229597535be0dbf3/Pathogen_Slide5.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1J3iulzVDm6SoaA8ImMAei/1e0ada9ca22b2ea9229597535be0dbf3/Pathogen_Slide5.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1J3iulzVDm6SoaA8ImMAei/1e0ada9ca22b2ea9229597535be0dbf3/Pathogen_Slide5.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1J3iulzVDm6SoaA8ImMAei/1e0ada9ca22b2ea9229597535be0dbf3/Pathogen_Slide5.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>When you think deeper, there's a couple of things that come out of this. When you look at the way these things transmit, the most likely way to cause a pandemic is for it to be done through the respiratory or the airborne route. There's much, much less you can do to stop an airborne virus or a respiratory/droplet spread virus. If I had measles right now, you would all be exposed. It's very, very hard to do that. But if it was something that was spread through, for example, fecal/oral, like hepatitis A or cholera, you can really delimit that with sanitation. Remember, there was a couple of cases of cholera in Mexico about five years ago, and everybody panicked. But there was just even a modicum of sanitation, and that stopped cholera. It did not spread in Mexico. You can't do that with respiratory viruses and airborne viruses. It's much, much harder through the respiratory or airborne&nbsp;bacteria.</p><p>A vector borne transmission, so that means through mosquitoes, through ticks, that's something that's very interesting and it is something that I think we struggle with trying to figure out exactly how bad a vector borne outbreak can get. They are, in general, limited by the vector range. For example, mosquitoes frolic in places that are going to be much more conducive to their habitat, so it's going to be very hard for them to live in a temperate climate. I live in Pennsylvania; we don't have mosquitoes year round there. But there are parts of the world that mosquitoes thrive in all year round. That's why I talked about specifically aedes mosquitoes, which are the mosquito that's responsible for spreading dengue, chikungunya, zika, yellow fever. They are basically covering half the population of the globe. That is something that's a little bit different with vector borne. In general, we don't think vector borne could do this because the host range, the range of the vector, is kind of&nbsp;limited.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2gNyqvRj5aEWUguSkqGSoi/14ebe251b614bdf9b73bbac2c8c19cb6/Pathogen_Slide6.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2gNyqvRj5aEWUguSkqGSoi/14ebe251b614bdf9b73bbac2c8c19cb6/Pathogen_Slide6.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2gNyqvRj5aEWUguSkqGSoi/14ebe251b614bdf9b73bbac2c8c19cb6/Pathogen_Slide6.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2gNyqvRj5aEWUguSkqGSoi/14ebe251b614bdf9b73bbac2c8c19cb6/Pathogen_Slide6.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2gNyqvRj5aEWUguSkqGSoi/14ebe251b614bdf9b73bbac2c8c19cb6/Pathogen_Slide6.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2gNyqvRj5aEWUguSkqGSoi/14ebe251b614bdf9b73bbac2c8c19cb6/Pathogen_Slide6.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2gNyqvRj5aEWUguSkqGSoi/14ebe251b614bdf9b73bbac2c8c19cb6/Pathogen_Slide6.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>The other thing to think about is, talking about global catastrophic biological risk, we talk about deaths, but is fatality everything? This is a question to pose to yourself. There's two purposes for an organism. To survive and to reproduce. What if you had a disease like zika, but which was much more widespread? Or rubella, pre-vaccine. If you decrease the reproductive fitness of a species, could that lead to a GCBR? I think the answer is yes. I don't think that zika or rubella really meet those criteria, and maybe if we were talking about this, if 4ubella occurred now, maybe it would fit in the GCBR. Back in the 1960s, people coped with rubella, but it is one way to think about a GCBR that doesn't end up killing&nbsp;everybody.</p><p>The other thing is, there's another virus, HTLV, which as been in the headlines a lot in the last couple of weeks because of some studies that have come out of Australia. HTLV is the most carcinogenic virus. It causes human t-cell leukemia. This was the first human retrovirus that was discovered. What if an infectious agent causes cancer in everybody? Would that lead to a GCBR? That's something just to think about, that it's not always going to necessarily be death. I think you have to be very broad and active minded about&nbsp;this.</p><p>There's also something I wanted to talk about called sapronotic disease. That's a term that we found from the plant world and the animal world, where you have this idea that if an infectious agent is killing everybody that it infects, it's not very good because it's going to run out of people to infect. But what if it doesn't care? What if people are just a secondary source for it? What if it's an amoeba that eats things in pond scum, but only intermittently infects humans, like the brain-eating amoebas that always grab headlines? How does that fit into this? If it doesn't necessarily need to be in humans to thrive. That it has other things. It could eat dead bark on a tree, or it can eat stuff on the bottom of the forest floor. That's another way to think about a pandemic pathogen, that I think is really&nbsp;interesting.</p><p>The first set of conclusions we drew from this project were, the traits that are most likely to be possessed are going to be respiratory/droplet transmission, with fecal/oral much less likely. The aedes vector borne agents, those mosquitoes, have a special status because there's widespread mosquito prevalence and there are certain viruses that get very high levels in your blood that these mosquitoes can just kind of pick off. That's why we've seen explosive outbreaks of dengue, chikungunya, zika, why we've seen yellow fever resurface. So they are a special category. They probably don't fall as high as respiratory/droplet, but that's something to keep in mind, that these could possibly do&nbsp;that.</p><p>So then the next thing we try to do is think about, okay, we've said respiratory/droplet transmission. So we have to make a choice, we have to think: is it gonna be virus, bacteria, fungi,&nbsp;parasite?</p><p>So I say there's no agnostics in a foxhole. We had to push people that we talked to in this thing, and push ourselves to think, what would it really be? So I think that viruses are very formidable in this realm. They mutate much, much more rapidly than bacteria. The transmission and replication cycle in a human is much faster than in bacteria. And you heard this earlier today, that there's no real broad spectrum antiviral&nbsp;agent.</p><p>I have a picture there, this is from Epcot Center, for penicillin. So when we think about bacterial infections, we can usually, even in the face of antibiotic resistance, craft together some regimen that works. And lots of them are nonspecific, they kill wide varieties of bacteria. They have a&nbsp;spectrum.</p><p>We don't have that so much with antiviral agents. We've got a certain drug for flu, a certain drug for hepatitis C, a certain drug for HIV. We don't have broad spectrum antivirals. And that's a major chink in the armor against&nbsp;viruses.</p><p>When you think about bacteria, they really are limited. Because of broad spectrum antibiotics, they're slower, they're less mutable. There are some caveats. We do have multi-drug resistant bacteria that can be challenging, and antibiotic resistance is probably one of the most pressing public health threats that we&nbsp;face.</p><p>But they still don't rise to the fact of causing a GCBR. Because even if you think about everything becoming resistant, we would be pulled back to the pre-penicillin era. But people still lived during the pre-penicillin era, in a way that they were still flourishing, human populations were still growing pre-penicillin. So I think that's important to&nbsp;remember.</p><p>But we have seen a major outbreak. For example, we talked about Yemen and the cholera outbreak that's occurring with the bombing that's going on, and the infrastructure problems, it's been the worst cholera outbreak in history. And we had a bad plague outbreak just a couple of years ago in Madagascar, with 1200 people&nbsp;infected.</p><p>So in certain resource-poor areas, you can see bacteria get very close to causing a GCBR. But it would be hard for it to do anything. So you think back to the Black Death back in the 1300s and 1400s. There were no antibiotics and I think that's why the Black Death probably does qualify for a GCBR at that&nbsp;time.</p><p>So the other thing, what about fungi? Fungi are everywhere in the environment. But the fact is, they're temperature restricted. They don't like to grow at human temperatures. And there's a lot of hypotheses about why this is. They think that humans actually came through what's called a mammalian filter, that we evolved the ability to have a 98.6 degree Fahrenheit or a 37.5 degree Celsius temperature as a way to avoid fungi. And we see fungi decimating salamanders and frogs, and all of these other types of species that have lower body&nbsp;temperatures.</p><p>And it's very, very hard for fungi to infect humans, they usually have to be immuno-compromised. There's been a few scary things, like candida orus, which is a multi-drug resistant fungi that preys on hospitalized patients. Cryptococcus gattii, which is one that kind of is around the soil and trees. And then there was this exserohilum outbreak. That was related to contaminated steroids, which you might've heard about that getting injected directly into people's backs. But again, they needed something to be able to do&nbsp;that.</p><p>Some of these fungi are sapronitic and they can be very, very high mortality rate because they don't transmit well between humans. But the temperature restriction makes it very hard for them to cause a&nbsp;pandemic.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/9jpVfxxszuuCgMC0qaMKi/70c968cee8053c68f78aef690327a0f0/Pathogen_Slide7.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/9jpVfxxszuuCgMC0qaMKi/70c968cee8053c68f78aef690327a0f0/Pathogen_Slide7.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/9jpVfxxszuuCgMC0qaMKi/70c968cee8053c68f78aef690327a0f0/Pathogen_Slide7.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/9jpVfxxszuuCgMC0qaMKi/70c968cee8053c68f78aef690327a0f0/Pathogen_Slide7.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/9jpVfxxszuuCgMC0qaMKi/70c968cee8053c68f78aef690327a0f0/Pathogen_Slide7.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/9jpVfxxszuuCgMC0qaMKi/70c968cee8053c68f78aef690327a0f0/Pathogen_Slide7.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/9jpVfxxszuuCgMC0qaMKi/70c968cee8053c68f78aef690327a0f0/Pathogen_Slide7.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>For prions, you've probably heard of mad cow disease, which is probably the most famous prion disease. Those don't spread very well between humans, unless there's cannibalism. This is a graffiti in Pittsburgh, there's a guy who writes kuru all over the city of Pittsburgh. Kuru was a disease that was found in Papua New Guinea among the indigenous tribes there, where they were engaging in ritualistic cannibalism of each other after someone died, and kuru was really decimating that&nbsp;population.</p><p>But unless you have people directly exposing themselves like that, in that manner, prions are unlikely to do that. We've seen scrapie for example, in the sheep species, and then chronic wasting disease in elk. Those things have done - because there's so much different saliva contact between people and the way these animals eat and interact with each other, that don't really apply to&nbsp;humans.</p><p>It's interesting, because when you think about prions, chronic wasting disease, they actually had to burn down a forest to stop it from spreading, because it was so endemic to the elk and deer in that region. So that's a testament to what a prion can do, but it's very restricted when you think about how prions could do this in&nbsp;humans.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2qiB6cpmM8KgMeq8m4QS8g/7c3d45165aadc1388ee047ab9702ac64/Pathogen_Slide8.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2qiB6cpmM8KgMeq8m4QS8g/7c3d45165aadc1388ee047ab9702ac64/Pathogen_Slide8.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2qiB6cpmM8KgMeq8m4QS8g/7c3d45165aadc1388ee047ab9702ac64/Pathogen_Slide8.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2qiB6cpmM8KgMeq8m4QS8g/7c3d45165aadc1388ee047ab9702ac64/Pathogen_Slide8.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2qiB6cpmM8KgMeq8m4QS8g/7c3d45165aadc1388ee047ab9702ac64/Pathogen_Slide8.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2qiB6cpmM8KgMeq8m4QS8g/7c3d45165aadc1388ee047ab9702ac64/Pathogen_Slide8.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2qiB6cpmM8KgMeq8m4QS8g/7c3d45165aadc1388ee047ab9702ac64/Pathogen_Slide8.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>This is something that most people don't know about. So we look to try to see, was there ever an extinction event from an infectious disease in any animal species? And there's one. This is the Christmas Island Rat, and it basically was driven to extinction, by a vector-borne, so mosquito-born, trypanosome. Trypanosomes are parasites, much bigger than bacteria or viruses. And the Christmas Island rat basically was rendered extinct because of&nbsp;it.</p><p>But does this apply to humans? I don't think it does, because the poor Christmas Rat couldn't go anywhere. It was on an island; there was nowhere for it to run. Humans can outrun a vector, and like I said, vectors are limited in where they can actually cause disease and where they can spread infections. And if you can outrun that vector, if you can move to places where it isn't there, you can probably avoid&nbsp;it.</p><p>I think that when you look at the human trypanosome diseases, they haven't done anything near what they did to the Christmas Island rat. There are some concerns when you talk about parasites and protozoa, about certain drug-resistant forms of malaria, especially if they make it from Asia to Africa, being able to maybe cause something on a GCBR level. But we haven't seen that&nbsp;yet.</p><p>There's lots of other things to think about when you think about infectious disease. Helminths, ectoparasites, amoeba, non-carbon based, so that's something when you talk about the mission to Mars, and thinking about how you're going to deal with organisms that may or may not come back&nbsp;there.</p><p>So there's lots of different things to think about, but really our consensus was that viruses are most likely going to be the GCBR agent, because of their mutability and their rapidity of spread, and their lack of an&nbsp;antiviral.</p><p>But when you get into viruses, there's so many viruses. There's lots of different rules and exceptions. Would the virus's genes be RNA, or DNA? Will it copy itself in the cytoplasm of a cell or will it be in the nucleus? Will it have a segmented genome like flu? Flu is one of the most prolific viruses, and the reason why it's so good at infecting people is because it can shuffle its genes, because they're all on a segment, and it can basically be like a deck of cards that switches different genes. So that's something that is really important to think about, whether it's segmented versus non-segmented. Does it have a really big genome like MERS and SARS? Or is it a very small&nbsp;genome?</p><p>And then what about these ones that are spread by mosquitoes? They get very high levels of the blood in people, are those the kind of viruses that are gonna be able to cause GCBR? In just a couple of headlines a monkey pox, which is a DNA virus that people are very nervous about in the wake of the smallpox eradication, people aren't vaccinating for smallpox routinely anymore, now monkey pox has resurged and the vaccine was protective against monkey&nbsp;pox.</p><p>So when you think about viruses, there's lots of different things to think about. Probably when you think about GCBR-level risks, flu goes to the top of this list, because it's done it so many times before. And we do have this scare right now that's been going on since probably the 1990s, regarding avian influenza. That's a picture from my local county fair in my hometown outside of&nbsp;Pittsburgh.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/U7tuFPrai2a8gK6gc22Kg/dca43c4dc6b8767314dc729c151b3254/Pathogen_Slide9.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/U7tuFPrai2a8gK6gc22Kg/dca43c4dc6b8767314dc729c151b3254/Pathogen_Slide9.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/U7tuFPrai2a8gK6gc22Kg/dca43c4dc6b8767314dc729c151b3254/Pathogen_Slide9.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/U7tuFPrai2a8gK6gc22Kg/dca43c4dc6b8767314dc729c151b3254/Pathogen_Slide9.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/U7tuFPrai2a8gK6gc22Kg/dca43c4dc6b8767314dc729c151b3254/Pathogen_Slide9.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/U7tuFPrai2a8gK6gc22Kg/dca43c4dc6b8767314dc729c151b3254/Pathogen_Slide9.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/U7tuFPrai2a8gK6gc22Kg/dca43c4dc6b8767314dc729c151b3254/Pathogen_Slide9.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>And when you think of avian flu, one of the scariest versions of this is H7N9.

A and B are both H7N9. So it's at the highest risk for emergency impact. So this is probably one of the scariest viruses that we face. And it meets a lot of those criteria that we talked&nbsp;about.</p><p>When you look at the steps in pandemic emergence, there's a bunch of steps that a virus has to do, this is specific for influenza. We're already down to around 3 to 4. The infection is replicating sufficiently to produce infectious virus, but we're seeing very stuttered human transmission. But we're getting down that road with&nbsp;H7N9.</p><p>So this isn't something that's very theoretical, what I'm talking about, this is something that we're dealing with today, now, in China, with&nbsp;H7N9.</p><p>I think what the CDC does is they actually rank the different properties of the virus, which I think is a very good thing to do. It might not always be accurate, but it does definitely give you some framework for how to evaluate viruses, and that's what we were doing with this framework, was trying to take this type of an assessment tool of viruses, of influenza, and apply it to the whole microbial world. And that's what this new paradigm that we made was going to try to&nbsp;accomplish.</p><p>So what do you do when you come up with these ideas, when you come up with these types of lists of things that might cause this? You can do what CEPI did. CEPI is the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness and Innovation. It's a major funder for vaccine research, and what they did is they came up with a list that they took from the WHO blueprint for research, and picked some to actually go&nbsp;after.</p><p>I think that's one way to do this, where you have diseases that meet this criteria, then you invest money to go into it, to develop&nbsp;vaccines.</p><p>A couple of other things, just a couple other headlines just to show you. People did think about space bacteria, but it's unlikely that space bacteria, if they're adapted to Mars, are going to be able to do very well in humans on Earth, because there's totally different conditions that would allow them to flourish on one planet, that wouldn't apply to another&nbsp;planet.</p><p>We talked to lots of people that were thinking about salamanders and frogs, which are being decimated by these sapronotic pathogens, but don't necessarily affect&nbsp;humans.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5drY4Ll5Kgoe4MS6AAM2MK/a146139fc2a474837d6bdc3f2066a6f6/Pathogen_Slide11.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5drY4Ll5Kgoe4MS6AAM2MK/a146139fc2a474837d6bdc3f2066a6f6/Pathogen_Slide11.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5drY4Ll5Kgoe4MS6AAM2MK/a146139fc2a474837d6bdc3f2066a6f6/Pathogen_Slide11.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5drY4Ll5Kgoe4MS6AAM2MK/a146139fc2a474837d6bdc3f2066a6f6/Pathogen_Slide11.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5drY4Ll5Kgoe4MS6AAM2MK/a146139fc2a474837d6bdc3f2066a6f6/Pathogen_Slide11.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5drY4Ll5Kgoe4MS6AAM2MK/a146139fc2a474837d6bdc3f2066a6f6/Pathogen_Slide11.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5drY4Ll5Kgoe4MS6AAM2MK/a146139fc2a474837d6bdc3f2066a6f6/Pathogen_Slide11.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>So a couple more conclusions there. Any microbe is capable of causing a GCBR. But we believe that RNA viruses are the most pressing and likely threat, because of their mutability, their zoonotic potential. Bacterial antimicrobial resistance is unlikely to reach GCBR levels, and GCBR level of widespread fungal disease is unlikely due to its temperature restrictions, and there are very select conditions for a prion-caused&nbsp;GCBR.</p><p>The last part of the talk, I just want to emphasize a few things. We're always surprised about infectious disease, and I list a bunch of them here.

There is this global virome approach, where people will go out and sequence everything that they want to do, and try to find a list of viruses that are out there. It tells you maybe what's coming, but it's very expensive, and 99 percent of those viruses are probably not going to pose any threat to humans. Also, what if the next GCBR or the next pandemic is not&nbsp;viral?</p><p>So that's one way to do it. Or there's another way to do it. I think this is the way I favor. It's looking at people that are getting infected by novel diseases. Looking at people like bush meat hunters, people who work in abattoirs, looking for what's called viral chatter, things that go from the first forays of a pathogen into humans. And then, looking at different hot spots. Instead of trying to sequence things, focus on things that are actually causing&nbsp;infections.</p><p>And then you think about unknown diagnoses. 50% of our septic shock cases, even in the United States, don't have a diagnosis, and I think that people just treat for symptoms and not necessarily for fevers. So I think that we're going about this a little bit wrongly. I think going after these unknown etiologies, all over the world, trying to figure out where these infections are occurring and actually running things down to specific diagnoses, instead of just saying, \"You've got some viral syndrome.\" I think that's the way to go about&nbsp;it.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/T7HUFdiHeeW8cYQIU6OIe/885e6442e4ada4b5810519fa9e24c2df/Pathogen_Slide13.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/T7HUFdiHeeW8cYQIU6OIe/885e6442e4ada4b5810519fa9e24c2df/Pathogen_Slide13.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/T7HUFdiHeeW8cYQIU6OIe/885e6442e4ada4b5810519fa9e24c2df/Pathogen_Slide13.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/T7HUFdiHeeW8cYQIU6OIe/885e6442e4ada4b5810519fa9e24c2df/Pathogen_Slide13.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/T7HUFdiHeeW8cYQIU6OIe/885e6442e4ada4b5810519fa9e24c2df/Pathogen_Slide13.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/T7HUFdiHeeW8cYQIU6OIe/885e6442e4ada4b5810519fa9e24c2df/Pathogen_Slide13.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/T7HUFdiHeeW8cYQIU6OIe/885e6442e4ada4b5810519fa9e24c2df/Pathogen_Slide13.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>A headline just came out of Nature a couple of days ago that really validates what we're saying, which is that you should spend much more on surveying actual infections, not on trying to predict things by viral cataloging.

It came out in 1996. And this is the book that really started for me when I was a little child. That was the one that my parents read me over and over and over again, which is the story of the rabies vaccine. So, thank you for your interest and I'm happy to take any questions in the time that's remaining, and I have office hours as well and feel free to follow me on Twitter or read my blog. Thanks again for your&nbsp;attention.</p><h1>Q&amp;A</h1><p><strong>Question:</strong> What are the challenges in creating a broad-spectrum antiviral? You alluded to it a bit, but, tell us&nbsp;more.</p><p><strong>Amesh:</strong> In general, antiviral therapy has lagged behind antibacterial therapy by a long shot. We haven't had many antivirals ever, until actually the modern era with HIV and hepatitis C. Viruses are much trickier to make an antiviral agent against, because remember that viruses don't have their own machinery, they're inside a human cell, so they're going to be using your ribosomes, all the stuff that you use to make protein. So, many of these things can be very toxic because they're going to be hitting things that your cells do as well. So you have to find something on the virus that only affects the virus and minimally impacts your own cellular&nbsp;function.</p><p>So that's very hard. Whereas, in a bacteria or a fungi, they're doing their own thing, so you can find things that target just them. With antivirals, it's very hard, you have to make sure, the toxicity would be too high if it's actually blocking your proteins' synthesis and not just the virus's. So I think that's the biggest challenge, is the fact that viruses use your stuff to actually do their functions and you can't explicitly target a virus the same way you can target a bacteria or a fungi or a worm or whatever else it could&nbsp;be.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> How does monoculture kind of fit into this? I mean, farming of animals mostly, maybe other things that humans cultivate as well that kind of become global. Does that increase our risk in a material&nbsp;way?</p><p><strong>Amesh:</strong> So that was something that we thought, with the monoculture you're thinking about, we were thinking mostly about humans here, so are humans a monoculture? And I don't think that that's the case, because it's said that the human immune system, within all the different humans that live on earth, can actually respond to any type of antigen. There's been some papers written about this, that the diversity of the human immune system globally, is enough that there's nothing that could really drive humans to complete extinction on its own. But, when you think about monoculture for other things, for animals or for plants, that clearly makes them vulnerable to a pathogen that could wipe them out, but not so much for humans. I think that there's enough genetic diversity, that we would be able to survive, at least a good proportion of us, with an infectious disease&nbsp;outbreak.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> How about things that may be dormant for a long time or asymptomatic for a long time, how does that kind of change the analysis of this&nbsp;stuff?</p><p><strong>Amesh:</strong> That's an interesting question. So when we talked about GCBR and the definition that we use to bound this, we talked about sudden, the word sudden. And when you think about a disease like HIV, what gave HIV the ability to cause this global pandemic like no other, basically, was the fact that it has this long latency period where people were still infectious, for 10 years about, from infection to when they would start showing symptoms, and in all that time they were contagious. So, that was very advantageous for HIV. When you're talking about GCBRs, then we're talking about the speed of it, but I do think that when you talk about this long latency and dormant period where someone can transmit a disease, that's a very, very huge advantage that a pathogen would have, and able to disseminate through a&nbsp;population.</p><p>It's unclear whether that would qualify as a GCBR because there would be time to prepare there, there would be people looking at it the way HIV is. And I think we struggled a lot with our definition of GCBR because HIV meets a lot of these criteria, but in terms of its rapidity, it's much different than the black death or 1918&nbsp;flu.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> About synthetic biology and the apparently ever-lowering barrier to entry into synthetic biology with, recently, hacker spaces for biology: How much does that worry you and how much should it worry&nbsp;me?</p><p><strong>Amesh:</strong> So, synthetic biology, the democratization of biology and the biohacker culture, are kind of a two edged sword. You get a lot of great minds now being engaged in awesome research and that could probably lead to new treatments, new cures, new discoveries, new types of knowledge, and I think that's a great thing. But the issue, I guess, is that there are people that would try to use this for nefarious purposes and I think that there's a fine line that has to be walked there. And I would say that, although it's becoming very, very simple to do synthetic biology, it's not easy to do. It's still not something that someone can do in their back yard or without any kind of proper training. So, I do think that, some of that risk is a little bit misplaced, because I don't think that people can just concoct these chimeric, crazy things in their garage and release&nbsp;them.</p><p>But I do think that it's important that they start to respect norms of biosafety and understand that when you work with these pathogens, even if you're not going to create the Andromeda strain, you need to be careful and actually understand that there is a science of biosafety and it's really important that you actually follow that so that you're not going to expose yourself or others to risk. So I think that this is something that people have been engaging with this community to try and teach them this type of stuff, but I do think they should be able to flourish. I think it's really great that they're able to do this type of work without the confines of a traditional academic&nbsp;career.</p>", "user": {"username": "The Centre for Effective Altruism"}}, {"_id": "zDL7HP5pXkabYRTzW", "title": "Assessing global catastrophic biological risks (Crystal Watson)", "postedAt": "2018-06-08T07:15:00.000Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O8rgvVOQXpk&amp;list=PLwp9xeoX5p8P3cDQwlyN7qsFhC9Ms4L5W&amp;index=11\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/O8rgvVOQXpk\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><hr><p>In this talk from EA Global 2018: San Francisco, Dr. Crystal Watson shares foundational thinking about Global Catastrophic Biological Risks, how the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins is working to better understand and reduce them, and how effective altruists may be able to get involved.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a transcript of Crystal's talk, and her answers to questions from the audience, which we have lightly edited for&nbsp;clarity.

This is a classic public health story that you may already know about, which I think demonstrates the devastating power of infectious diseases, but also the power of humankind to address these types of risks. Our center was co-founded under the direction of Dr. D. A. Henderson, the leader of the World Health Organization's campaign to eradicate smallpox back in the 1970s and&nbsp;80s.</p><p>Prior to 1977, when he had the last case of smallpox in nature, the disease was endemic to many parts of the world. Even when smallpox had been eliminated from some places like the United States, it was still killing about 2 million people a year before eradication began. And even in the US, as late as 1947, when there was an introduction of a case from somewhere else in the world, it was a huge problem. In 1947, there was one imported case in New York City, which resulted in just a handful of secondary cases. That exposure resulted in the vaccination of about 2.5 million people, to give an idea of what a problem this&nbsp;was.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3S4SXBhxAAkOwyWUcAMyQW/9a2c54f8704a2e0cf514dd9c91f4b993/GCBR_Slide_1.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3S4SXBhxAAkOwyWUcAMyQW/9a2c54f8704a2e0cf514dd9c91f4b993/GCBR_Slide_1.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3S4SXBhxAAkOwyWUcAMyQW/9a2c54f8704a2e0cf514dd9c91f4b993/GCBR_Slide_1.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3S4SXBhxAAkOwyWUcAMyQW/9a2c54f8704a2e0cf514dd9c91f4b993/GCBR_Slide_1.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3S4SXBhxAAkOwyWUcAMyQW/9a2c54f8704a2e0cf514dd9c91f4b993/GCBR_Slide_1.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3S4SXBhxAAkOwyWUcAMyQW/9a2c54f8704a2e0cf514dd9c91f4b993/GCBR_Slide_1.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3S4SXBhxAAkOwyWUcAMyQW/9a2c54f8704a2e0cf514dd9c91f4b993/GCBR_Slide_1.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Smallpox was one of the most dreaded diseases in history. It killed about a third of the people who were infected, and those who survived where permanently scarred. As well as scarring, some survivors were blinded by the disease as well. Smallpox was particularly devastating when it was introduced into an immunologically na\u00efve population, meaning a population that hadn't experienced the virus before. For example, when smallpox - along with measles and some other childhood diseases - was introduced into the Western Hemisphere in 1492, over the next century it resulted in an epidemic that killed up to 90% of the impacted native populations, which in turn caused widespread social and economic&nbsp;collapse.</p><p>Fortunately, smallpox also ushered in the vaccine era, with discovery of the first vaccine by Edward Jenner. But without a vaccine, and for na\u00efve populations, the disease could be catastrophic. So, smallpox was a terrible burden for humanity for centuries, and its eradication was one of humanity's greatest achievements. Dr. Henderson really took up the mantle of eradication when he was called upon. The program that he helped lead was a true testament to what can be done when you have excellent leadership, operational ingenuity, and some really simple&nbsp;tools.</p><p>When DA started his work in Geneva, smallpox was endemic to many parts of the world. The goal was to have zero cases, or \"smallpox zero\", as they called it. In order to reach that goal, they had to reach both some of the most densely populated areas on earth, and also some of the most remote villages that were very hard to access. And it had to be done on a shoestring budget. The estimate for the total cost of eradication was only 300 million dollars for about a 10 year&nbsp;program.</p><p>There were specific characteristics of the variola virus - the virus responsible for smallpox - that made it possible to eradicate. It only infected humans, meaning that there was no animal reservoir, so it didn't lurk somewhere else with the possibility of being reintroduced into the human population. It was not communicable until someone was symptomatic; if there was asymptomic spread, it would have made it more difficult to control. And we had a very effective vaccine. There was also a very simple tool that was developed during the eradication campaign, called the bifurcated needle, which is pictured&nbsp;here:</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2U44VAq3e8couMWqg4EE0q/01d3f0e72be83f6321c672025ef8282f/GCBR_Slide_2.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2U44VAq3e8couMWqg4EE0q/01d3f0e72be83f6321c672025ef8282f/GCBR_Slide_2.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2U44VAq3e8couMWqg4EE0q/01d3f0e72be83f6321c672025ef8282f/GCBR_Slide_2.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2U44VAq3e8couMWqg4EE0q/01d3f0e72be83f6321c672025ef8282f/GCBR_Slide_2.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2U44VAq3e8couMWqg4EE0q/01d3f0e72be83f6321c672025ef8282f/GCBR_Slide_2.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2U44VAq3e8couMWqg4EE0q/01d3f0e72be83f6321c672025ef8282f/GCBR_Slide_2.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2U44VAq3e8couMWqg4EE0q/01d3f0e72be83f6321c672025ef8282f/GCBR_Slide_2.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>The bifurcated needle works like so: you dip the needle into some of the smallpox vaccine, and it holds that very small amount of vaccine liquid in between its prongs through capillary action. Then, the needle is used to vaccinate on an arm, by being pressed into the skin multiple&nbsp;times.</p><p>This application was actually very effective - enough to induce immunity, and it was also very easy to teach somebody how to administer. The ease of administration let D. A. and his team deputize people all over the world to go out and become eradicators. Tens of thousands of people in all corners of the globe were going from house to house, from village to village, giving this vaccination and helping with&nbsp;eradication.</p><p>The reason I start with this example is that while it demonstrates the catastrophic nature of some infectious disease emergencies, I think it also proves that humanity has the capacity to come together on a global scale, and combat these types of infectious diseases and biological threats. So I take hope from this for the future, because now we know that there are biological events that are possible that could be much worse than&nbsp;smallpox.</p><h2>Defining Global Catastrophic Biological&nbsp;Risks</h2><p>GCBRS are one of a few categories of risk with the potential, I think, to severely or even permanently derail humanity. Our center has been working to help define these risks, and this is just a short summary of what we think characterizes&nbsp;GCBRs.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5IrZrHiQqQsEGooeEku2Uq/394966e53e539c4950f7f7e9c5bebc4a/GCBR_Slide_3.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5IrZrHiQqQsEGooeEku2Uq/394966e53e539c4950f7f7e9c5bebc4a/GCBR_Slide_3.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5IrZrHiQqQsEGooeEku2Uq/394966e53e539c4950f7f7e9c5bebc4a/GCBR_Slide_3.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5IrZrHiQqQsEGooeEku2Uq/394966e53e539c4950f7f7e9c5bebc4a/GCBR_Slide_3.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5IrZrHiQqQsEGooeEku2Uq/394966e53e539c4950f7f7e9c5bebc4a/GCBR_Slide_3.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5IrZrHiQqQsEGooeEku2Uq/394966e53e539c4950f7f7e9c5bebc4a/GCBR_Slide_3.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5IrZrHiQqQsEGooeEku2Uq/394966e53e539c4950f7f7e9c5bebc4a/GCBR_Slide_3.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>They are events in which a biological agent could lead to sudden extraordinary widespread disaster. Importantly, in order for an event to be catastrophic, it would have to quickly go beyond the normal capabilities of governments and the private sector to manage it. And if totally unchecked, a GCBR would have many other devastating effects beyond just the death toll of the disease&nbsp;itself.</p><p>As a shorthand for catastrophic biological events we think of GCBRs as at the level of 1918 influenza pandemic and above. The 1918 flu is estimated to have killed on the order of 50 to 100 million people, which is more than were killed in all the wars of the 20th century&nbsp;combined.</p><p>Obviously, most biological events are not going to be catastrophic. We have a long history of epidemics and even pandemics, which were either brought under control, or just didn't have the characteristics that would make them catastrophic events. But we do think there are a handful of scenarios that could have catastrophic&nbsp;potential.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3BpJRZ6YEE8oU82u2MQYGQ/fce3fb240050664c42176fb2343f01b3/GCBR_Slide_4.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3BpJRZ6YEE8oU82u2MQYGQ/fce3fb240050664c42176fb2343f01b3/GCBR_Slide_4.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3BpJRZ6YEE8oU82u2MQYGQ/fce3fb240050664c42176fb2343f01b3/GCBR_Slide_4.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3BpJRZ6YEE8oU82u2MQYGQ/fce3fb240050664c42176fb2343f01b3/GCBR_Slide_4.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3BpJRZ6YEE8oU82u2MQYGQ/fce3fb240050664c42176fb2343f01b3/GCBR_Slide_4.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3BpJRZ6YEE8oU82u2MQYGQ/fce3fb240050664c42176fb2343f01b3/GCBR_Slide_4.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3BpJRZ6YEE8oU82u2MQYGQ/fce3fb240050664c42176fb2343f01b3/GCBR_Slide_4.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Specifically, we think it's conceivable that bio-warfare could be catastrophic. Globally we have a history of offensive biological weapons programs by nation states, many of which were discontinued in the 70s and the 80s. In addition, the US had a biological weapons program, which was also discontinued. But we think that there are some nations that still have biological weapons as an active&nbsp;focus.</p><p>Bioterrorism, particularly a series of bioterrorism attacks, has the potential to be catastrophic, depending on the agent that's used. Giving recent advancements in a synthetic biology and biotechnology, an accidental or an intentional release of an engineered pathogen could be catastrophic. There are also scenarios where ecosystems that we rely on for survival could be disrupted through biological means, which could cause, among other risks, the catastrophic elimination of a major food&nbsp;source.</p><p>And finally there's a possibility of a natural emergence. Of a novel, highly virulent, highly transmissible pathogen, which could be a bad day for us. So, although the probability of any one of these things happening is very small and difficult to quantify, any of these scenarios, if one were to occur, could negatively alter the course of human history. So, I think spending some time and investing some effort in combating some of these risks is important to&nbsp;do.</p><h2>GCBR Work at the Center for Health&nbsp;Security</h2><p>Now that I've spoken a little bit about the risks, I want to highlight some of the work that our center is doing to begin to address these problems. I should also say that there are a number of other organizations like The Future of Humanity Institute, The Cambridge Center for Existential Risk, and the Center for Catastrophic Risk that have been addressing other types of catastrophic risk, such as AI and nuclear winter, but GCBRs are still a relatively new area of&nbsp;study.</p><p>So, in beginning to think about these risks, our center wanted to first propose a definition, and provide examples of potential GCB events. My colleague Monica Schoch-Spana is currently working on a project looking at fine tuning that definition and also trying to find ways to communicate about these risks so that more people can get engaged and involved. My colleague Amesh Adalja just finished a project looking at the characteristics of pandemic pathogens: what would make a pathogen more likely to become a pandemic or a GCB&nbsp;event.</p><p>We have work going on by Dr. Gigi Gronvall, who did a red teaming exercise recently. She brought together biologists from all stages of their careers to brainstorm about how biology could be misused. That was done with the purpose of trying to improve our ability to detect and understand when something bad is going to happen in&nbsp;biology.</p><p>So those are the risk side of the equation. We're also working on some projects looking at how to address these risks. My colleague Caitlin Rivers is working on a project to bring epidemic modeling, and data science, more into the field of epidemic response, which doesn't always happen now. And I'm working with a team, including Caitlyn, Tara Sell and Matt Watson, to look at types of technologies that we think could be useful in either preventing or in actually responding to a serious pandemic. We're keeping in mind the gold standard of the bifurcated needle. That's what we want to do. We want to find the next bifurcated&nbsp;needle.</p><p>One other project that we're very proud of, which we finished last month, was called the Clade X Pandemic Exercise. We brought together senior leaders, former government officials including former Senator Tom Daschle, former CDC Director Julie Gerberding, and a former FDA commissioner, and they all came together and sat at the table and went through a catastrophic risk&nbsp;exercise.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4cCqxGkQoMyY88SYAwQkSM/438d7d6b05cba9888777a80d0662e614/GCBR_Slide_5.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4cCqxGkQoMyY88SYAwQkSM/438d7d6b05cba9888777a80d0662e614/GCBR_Slide_5.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4cCqxGkQoMyY88SYAwQkSM/438d7d6b05cba9888777a80d0662e614/GCBR_Slide_5.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4cCqxGkQoMyY88SYAwQkSM/438d7d6b05cba9888777a80d0662e614/GCBR_Slide_5.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4cCqxGkQoMyY88SYAwQkSM/438d7d6b05cba9888777a80d0662e614/GCBR_Slide_5.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4cCqxGkQoMyY88SYAwQkSM/438d7d6b05cba9888777a80d0662e614/GCBR_Slide_5.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4cCqxGkQoMyY88SYAwQkSM/438d7d6b05cba9888777a80d0662e614/GCBR_Slide_5.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>We <a href=\"http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/events/2018_clade_x_exercise/livestream\">live-streamed</a> the event, which has a lot of interesting lessons. The Clade X exercise involved the fictitious release of a genetically engineered pathogen, which was a pair influenza virus with added variance factors from a closely related virus. This combination made Clade X about as transmissible as SARS and less than influenza. Its case fatality ratio was also moderate, greater than that of 1918 flu, but much less than viruses like Ebola or H5N1&nbsp;flu.</p><p>The virus in the scenario was introduced in multiple attacks around the world, and then it spread globally. The scenario progressed and eventually led to a catastrophic outcome, with more than 150 million deaths worldwide within about 18 months. Some of the key points that were highlighted in this scenario were about the need for rapid development, manufacturing and distribution of vaccine, the need for planning our responses to this kind of an event, and the need for both national and global cooperation and preparation. These are just to name a few of the issues.</p><p>We're excited to see that the Clade X exercise is already raising awareness in the US and internationally, and we're hoping it will have some more tangible impacts. We've got an indication that it may be influencing some legislation that's moving in the US House right now, which is exciting. All that being said, there is a lot more work that we need to do to reduce GCBRs. If you're interested in this topic, and you want to engage further, there's a number or ways I think that members of the EA community can&nbsp;engage.</p><h2>How to Engage with&nbsp;GCBR-Mitigation</h2><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1HrbotXr7CS4s6Um6UaimE/aa5da440c55dffae252a9588a9b3a846/GCBR_Slide_6.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1HrbotXr7CS4s6Um6UaimE/aa5da440c55dffae252a9588a9b3a846/GCBR_Slide_6.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1HrbotXr7CS4s6Um6UaimE/aa5da440c55dffae252a9588a9b3a846/GCBR_Slide_6.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1HrbotXr7CS4s6Um6UaimE/aa5da440c55dffae252a9588a9b3a846/GCBR_Slide_6.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1HrbotXr7CS4s6Um6UaimE/aa5da440c55dffae252a9588a9b3a846/GCBR_Slide_6.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1HrbotXr7CS4s6Um6UaimE/aa5da440c55dffae252a9588a9b3a846/GCBR_Slide_6.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1HrbotXr7CS4s6Um6UaimE/aa5da440c55dffae252a9588a9b3a846/GCBR_Slide_6.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>The first way to engage is through work and innovation. Finding the next bifurcated needle is a big challenge, but it could change the game for GCBRs. If you want to do research there's a number of graduate programs, some of which were highlighted on the recent <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/tom-inglesby-health-security/\">80,000 Hours podcast</a> with our director, Tom Inglesby. We're also starting a doctoral level program at Johns Hopkins, focused on health security, and we're looking for students. Another way to contribute is to apply to an organization to donate your time or resources to help organizations who are tackling these&nbsp;issues.</p><p>If you don't want to do research, policy change is extremely important as well. I went into government briefly at the Federal level, and in my experience, there's a lot you can do from inside government to make changes. And finally, spreading the word about Global Catastrophic Biological Risks is always very&nbsp;important.</p><h1>Q&amp;A</h1><p><strong>Question:</strong> Are we just getting lucky? A catastrophic pandemic hasn't happened in 100 years, but I can recall Ebola and SARS and there's always the kind of bird flu, swine flu news items running around. Is this rare or are we lucky, or how should I be thinking about&nbsp;that?</p><p><strong>Crystal:</strong> I think it's a combination of luck and, sometimes, successful interventions to make these outbreaks less severe. But I do think we've seen a number of pandemics in history that have been quite devastating for humanity, and so I do think it's kind of an inevitable thing that we will see something&nbsp;else.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> Do you see danger in bringing the brain trust together, such as you did in the Clade X livestream? Is there a potential risk in just bringing people together and thinking about this in a structured way in the first&nbsp;place?</p><p><strong>Crystal:</strong> Yeah, so there's not a way to classify information outside of the government space, but I think it's really important to keep in mind that there is information risk when you're talking about these things. We don't want to create a recipe for somebody to follow, to do something really terrible. We definitely keep that in mind in everything that we do. Gigi's project has some potential information risk, but she every step of the way wanted to keep that in mind and make sure that information that made the risks worse wasn't put out into the&nbsp;world.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> Can you contextualize for us what 150 million deaths looks like to the 6.85 billion of us who are still hopefully around when that happens? Does that bring us to the brink or are we resilient to&nbsp;that?</p><p><strong>Crystal:</strong> I think we've seen resilience to that level of pandemic before. There are different flavors of catastrophic risk. Our center has focused on all across the spectrum, but we come from a background of doing traditional bio-security. We think it's really important to focus on these higher level risks, but I think there are some that could derail humanity, but not necessarily end humanity. But there may be some existential risks as&nbsp;well.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> Do you think there are lessons from other categories of x-risk that can be applied to [the field of] biology? You mentioned that GCBR risk analysis is a little bit newer, but they're all pretty new. Are there things that you can draw from, say, the AI research field to apply to your&nbsp;work?</p><p><strong>Crystal:</strong> Yeah, I think GCBRs are so new that even just taking the time to sit down and think about them in a systematic way is a good start. I'm sure there are many other lessons that can be learned from existential risk research, but we're basically at the definition stage with GCBRs. We have a lot of work to&nbsp;do.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> Are there any particularly compelling platforms, systems, technologies in the space of pandemic preparedness that you think would be worth highlighting for the audience as early things to familiarize themselves&nbsp;with?</p><p><strong>Crystal:</strong> Yeah, so we've just done this project looking at technologies that we think could be helpful. There's a number of technologies that I think are potentially game changing. For example, although there's a lot of risk potentially with Synthetic Biology, it is one of our best tools to combat these issues. So, using Synthetic Biology - doing distributed manufacturing of medical countermeasures - could be something that changes the game when we need to respond to something bad. There'll be a lot more information in our report coming out, so I don't want to go into too much depth, but I think that's one area of needed&nbsp;investment.</p>", "user": {"username": "The Centre for Effective Altruism"}}, {"_id": "XtNgkrnFnedx92iN3", "title": "Ben Garfinkel: The future of surveillance", "postedAt": "2018-06-08T07:51:27.197Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4g5mCy5yr8&amp;list=PLwp9xeoX5p8P3cDQwlyN7qsFhC9Ms4L5W&amp;index=10\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/w4g5mCy5yr8\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><hr><p><i>Too much surveillance can lead to privacy violations and creeping authoritarianism, but too little can lead to catastrophe.

The way I'm going to make this case is that first, I'm going to describe two ways in which the future of surveillance can be quite bad. Then I'm going to describe a more positive future, and argue that this isn't something that appears very frequently in discussions of surveillance, but something that plausibly more people in effective altruism ought to be thinking about.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4BVI2kLTfao4OIe0gWIk6c/0a2fda0c08edf8e7f17cad02b87ea0be/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___1_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4BVI2kLTfao4OIe0gWIk6c/0a2fda0c08edf8e7f17cad02b87ea0be/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___1_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4BVI2kLTfao4OIe0gWIk6c/0a2fda0c08edf8e7f17cad02b87ea0be/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___1_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4BVI2kLTfao4OIe0gWIk6c/0a2fda0c08edf8e7f17cad02b87ea0be/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___1_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4BVI2kLTfao4OIe0gWIk6c/0a2fda0c08edf8e7f17cad02b87ea0be/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___1_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4BVI2kLTfao4OIe0gWIk6c/0a2fda0c08edf8e7f17cad02b87ea0be/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___1_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4BVI2kLTfao4OIe0gWIk6c/0a2fda0c08edf8e7f17cad02b87ea0be/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___1_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>So, first, here are a couple of outcomes we don't want for the future of surveillance. On the left, we have a depiction of what seems to be perhaps a bit of a violation of privacy or not as much accountability as you'd want for your system of surveillance. On the right we seem to have, perhaps some sort of oversight. It seems like a significant security issue is unfolding that perhaps we wanted a little bit more intense surveillance to&nbsp;prevent.</p><h2>Two failure modes for&nbsp;surveillance</h2><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4uceiocQow2ik8EOgCUEGA/5979b1e4f10cd5a5d1c0a8e178c4ddcd/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___2_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4uceiocQow2ik8EOgCUEGA/5979b1e4f10cd5a5d1c0a8e178c4ddcd/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___2_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4uceiocQow2ik8EOgCUEGA/5979b1e4f10cd5a5d1c0a8e178c4ddcd/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___2_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4uceiocQow2ik8EOgCUEGA/5979b1e4f10cd5a5d1c0a8e178c4ddcd/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___2_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4uceiocQow2ik8EOgCUEGA/5979b1e4f10cd5a5d1c0a8e178c4ddcd/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___2_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4uceiocQow2ik8EOgCUEGA/5979b1e4f10cd5a5d1c0a8e178c4ddcd/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___2_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4uceiocQow2ik8EOgCUEGA/5979b1e4f10cd5a5d1c0a8e178c4ddcd/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___2_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>To describe the first scenario in less of a caricature, the concern here is that currently, governments are collecting a very large amount of data about individuals all over the world. This seems to be increasing over time. Everything we do online mostly ends up collected, people walking around with things in their pockets which have microphones and cameras and GPS locators. Surveillance cameras are becoming more prevalent, too. It just seems like in general, we should expect the amount of data collected on individuals to keep going up over time. Probably more importantly, the ability to use this data is also going up as well. Partly this is a matter of better analysis, better data mining to identify individuals from mass collected data, things of that nature.</p><p>Partly, also, it's a matter of being able to more efficiently use the information which is gleaned from data mining. Just one quick example, which is fairly benign but somewhat suggestive: in recent years it's become somewhat common, in some provinces in China, to used facial recognition cameras to do things like automatically recognize people who are jaywalking and automatically fine them. A bit of a slightly longer-term thing is the idea of a social credit score. This is the idea of using large amounts of data collected about people, including, for example, their social media postings or the crimes they commit, and using this to assign people a score which will affect their employment prospects, their ability to travel or get into certain schools. And although none of this stuff is yet very significant, there's some suggestion that in the long-run future, or if you let this go for just a few more decades, we may see much more strong versions of social incentive shaping and much more invasive forms of surveillance. In the long run you might be more concerned about countries being more authoritarian or just political institutions we care about working less&nbsp;well.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/XnHfoXFZe0ccIY8CIECCe/439b4e25c22ce45d7dfe88480e83ec85/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___3_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/XnHfoXFZe0ccIY8CIECCe/439b4e25c22ce45d7dfe88480e83ec85/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___3_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/XnHfoXFZe0ccIY8CIECCe/439b4e25c22ce45d7dfe88480e83ec85/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___3_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/XnHfoXFZe0ccIY8CIECCe/439b4e25c22ce45d7dfe88480e83ec85/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___3_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/XnHfoXFZe0ccIY8CIECCe/439b4e25c22ce45d7dfe88480e83ec85/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___3_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/XnHfoXFZe0ccIY8CIECCe/439b4e25c22ce45d7dfe88480e83ec85/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___3_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/XnHfoXFZe0ccIY8CIECCe/439b4e25c22ce45d7dfe88480e83ec85/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___3_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>The other category of risk that you might be concerned about is the ineffectual surveillance scenario. The argument for this concern is that, in the future, it may be the case that methods of causing large amounts of harm become a lot cheaper or easier to use. Right now, if you want to hurt a lot of people, it's not that easy to do that; it's difficult to to hurt more than a few hundred people. But this is, to some extent, probably a matter of what technology is available. Some people have suggested that, for instance, synthetic biology, given perhaps a few decades, may make it easy for relatively small groups of people to design pathogens that can harm very large&nbsp;numbers.</p><p>Other technologies which are sometimes discussed with this sort of narrative are cheap drone swarms, in the longer-term future nano-weapons or especially disruptive cyber weapons. It's not necessarily clear that any of these individual technologies is extremely likely to have this property of making it very cheap to cause large amounts of harm. But we can draw an analogy to suggest what the significance of these technologies would be. So suppose that it turned out to be the case that nuclear weapons were much cheaper to make than they in fact are, say that rather than requiring massive state programs and years and years of work, that anyone could fairly easily construct nuclear weapons from household materials. It seems like in a world of that sort, the odds that they wouldn't be used would be very, very low, and you'd likely need some very pervasive form of surveillance to actually catch people who were planning to cause this large amount of harm. We don't know that any future technology will have these properties, but it seems not entirely impossible that one might. And if that's the case then we'll want, probably, much more effective forms of&nbsp;surveillance.</p><h2>The trade-off&nbsp;narrative</h2><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3vRGn6L6WIQAuoUuwYYyOe/6dcc19162c4d8a7e006521dc53a04b7d/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___4_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3vRGn6L6WIQAuoUuwYYyOe/6dcc19162c4d8a7e006521dc53a04b7d/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___4_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3vRGn6L6WIQAuoUuwYYyOe/6dcc19162c4d8a7e006521dc53a04b7d/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___4_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3vRGn6L6WIQAuoUuwYYyOe/6dcc19162c4d8a7e006521dc53a04b7d/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___4_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3vRGn6L6WIQAuoUuwYYyOe/6dcc19162c4d8a7e006521dc53a04b7d/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___4_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3vRGn6L6WIQAuoUuwYYyOe/6dcc19162c4d8a7e006521dc53a04b7d/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___4_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3vRGn6L6WIQAuoUuwYYyOe/6dcc19162c4d8a7e006521dc53a04b7d/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___4_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Something which is typically a part of discussions of surveillance is a trade off narrative. So on the one hand, there's this idea that the more you protect people's privacy, the less you allow governments to actually protect people's security. And on the other hand, there's this idea that, the more you make the government accountable, and sort of let people know what they're up to, the less effectively governments will be able to operate. To explain or justify the privacy/security trade off, let's take the case of someone who's carrying a bag that may or may not have a bomb in it, and consider a police officer who'd like to know if it has a bomb, who doesn't have any tools available to them.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3kUCULOFxeoeigsIqOGAOw/495b8a5feb338b703a6e3bbae664a59b/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___5_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3kUCULOFxeoeigsIqOGAOw/495b8a5feb338b703a6e3bbae664a59b/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___5_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3kUCULOFxeoeigsIqOGAOw/495b8a5feb338b703a6e3bbae664a59b/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___5_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3kUCULOFxeoeigsIqOGAOw/495b8a5feb338b703a6e3bbae664a59b/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___5_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3kUCULOFxeoeigsIqOGAOw/495b8a5feb338b703a6e3bbae664a59b/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___5_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3kUCULOFxeoeigsIqOGAOw/495b8a5feb338b703a6e3bbae664a59b/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___5_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3kUCULOFxeoeigsIqOGAOw/495b8a5feb338b703a6e3bbae664a59b/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___5_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>It seems like the officer's two options are to, first of all, they can potentially open up the bag and look at what's inside, and see if there's a bomb. But in the process they'll figure out everything else that's in the bag, and some of this might be quite personally revealing. On the other hand, they can choose not to open the bag, and therefore not violate the person's privacy, but in choosing not to open the bag, they also don't learn whether or not there's a bomb&nbsp;inside.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3laBgpwRl6Ws0gUkuyaySI/b89c1e5ee1fdd26f9fe9bf52d9ba1c74/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___6_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3laBgpwRl6Ws0gUkuyaySI/b89c1e5ee1fdd26f9fe9bf52d9ba1c74/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___6_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3laBgpwRl6Ws0gUkuyaySI/b89c1e5ee1fdd26f9fe9bf52d9ba1c74/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___6_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3laBgpwRl6Ws0gUkuyaySI/b89c1e5ee1fdd26f9fe9bf52d9ba1c74/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___6_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3laBgpwRl6Ws0gUkuyaySI/b89c1e5ee1fdd26f9fe9bf52d9ba1c74/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___6_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3laBgpwRl6Ws0gUkuyaySI/b89c1e5ee1fdd26f9fe9bf52d9ba1c74/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___6_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3laBgpwRl6Ws0gUkuyaySI/b89c1e5ee1fdd26f9fe9bf52d9ba1c74/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___6_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>The accountability/security trade off, the idea here is that, let's say take the case of a protocol which is used to select people for search or a special scrutiny.

Is it something which is discriminatory? Is it something which is fair? Does it have a sufficiently high accuracy rate?

Even if you have the mindset that only one of these two risks is actually credible or of significant importance other than the fact that other people care about the other risks, it means that there will be political constraints on pursuing solutions to one risk or the other. As a sort of an extreme caricature, let's say that you're someone who doesn't care about privacy at all, you think that the risk from authoritarianism isn't in any way important, and you think would be really great if the government put cameras in every single person's home and watched them all the time. The fact that other people are definitely not cool with that means that your proposed solution would be a nonstarter. So in general, it seems like the more severe the trade off is between these values, the more concerned we should be about either risk or both risks&nbsp;together.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4iivFxoCbCQAw2CUU0KU6a/1d34c6e82ddc5c12fb2f43bf3d1a5f4f/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___8_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4iivFxoCbCQAw2CUU0KU6a/1d34c6e82ddc5c12fb2f43bf3d1a5f4f/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___8_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4iivFxoCbCQAw2CUU0KU6a/1d34c6e82ddc5c12fb2f43bf3d1a5f4f/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___8_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4iivFxoCbCQAw2CUU0KU6a/1d34c6e82ddc5c12fb2f43bf3d1a5f4f/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___8_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4iivFxoCbCQAw2CUU0KU6a/1d34c6e82ddc5c12fb2f43bf3d1a5f4f/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___8_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4iivFxoCbCQAw2CUU0KU6a/1d34c6e82ddc5c12fb2f43bf3d1a5f4f/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___8_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4iivFxoCbCQAw2CUU0KU6a/1d34c6e82ddc5c12fb2f43bf3d1a5f4f/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___8_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>This all seems to suggest that a useful thing to do would be to look for opportunities to reduce these two trade offs. This means looking for ways to make surveillance more accountable and privacy preserving. While this sounds a bit idealistic, we can get some intuition that it is possible by looking at different forms of surveillance which are applied today, and that definitely vary quite significantly in how much they protect people's privacy. So if we were trying to get into the case of a bag that may or may not have a bomb in it, suppose that instead of just opening the bag, a police officer has access to a bomb sniffing dog. In this case, they can have the dog come up to the bag and sniff it. If the dog barks, the officer opens the bag and search. If the dog doesn't bark, the officer&nbsp;doesn't.</p><p>In the idealized case with a dog that has a perfect accuracy rate, they only learn exactly what's relevant for security: Does a person have a bomb? But they don't violate people's privacy in any other way. And the more accurate it is, the less it violates people's privacy. At the same time, this is also a fairly accountable form of surveillance. If you have your bag on you, you can tell that a dog was used rather than just a person rifling through it. You can also tell whether the dog barked. It's difficult to lie that a dog has barked when it hasn't, because you can hear&nbsp;it.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2sZ2BexfVWS4OIYQiYW2Ak/e244255d70599846a41b6b13a9ec6df0/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___9_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2sZ2BexfVWS4OIYQiYW2Ak/e244255d70599846a41b6b13a9ec6df0/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___9_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2sZ2BexfVWS4OIYQiYW2Ak/e244255d70599846a41b6b13a9ec6df0/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___9_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2sZ2BexfVWS4OIYQiYW2Ak/e244255d70599846a41b6b13a9ec6df0/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___9_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2sZ2BexfVWS4OIYQiYW2Ak/e244255d70599846a41b6b13a9ec6df0/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___9_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2sZ2BexfVWS4OIYQiYW2Ak/e244255d70599846a41b6b13a9ec6df0/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___9_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2sZ2BexfVWS4OIYQiYW2Ak/e244255d70599846a41b6b13a9ec6df0/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___9_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>So, that's a sort of a specific case. A more sort of abstract case for optimism is that in the future, it's likely that surveillance and law enforcement will become more heavily automated. While this has a number of scary components to it, there's also some reasons to think that this trend may actually make it easier to ensure privacy and accountability. So here's some basic advantages of automation: first of all, if you automate an analysis task that would ordinarily be performed by a human, then you can use software as a screen between data and the humans who see it. So the analogy is to a sniffing dog. Again, if you have some piece of software which looks at data and makes some initial judgment of whether to search further, then potentially a human doesn't need to look at data that they would otherwise look at. You can also potentially redact sensitive information automatically so that no human ever needs to see it. One concrete example would be automatic face blurring of faces that appear in police body camera&nbsp;footage.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3WCzhoJhl6McIeKgeOuECS/3c4894f9836f7408bee86b27b6f88265/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___10_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3WCzhoJhl6McIeKgeOuECS/3c4894f9836f7408bee86b27b6f88265/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___10_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3WCzhoJhl6McIeKgeOuECS/3c4894f9836f7408bee86b27b6f88265/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___10_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3WCzhoJhl6McIeKgeOuECS/3c4894f9836f7408bee86b27b6f88265/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___10_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3WCzhoJhl6McIeKgeOuECS/3c4894f9836f7408bee86b27b6f88265/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___10_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3WCzhoJhl6McIeKgeOuECS/3c4894f9836f7408bee86b27b6f88265/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___10_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3WCzhoJhl6McIeKgeOuECS/3c4894f9836f7408bee86b27b6f88265/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___10_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>In certain regards, algorithms are also more predictable and less opaque than humans. AI is often a black box, but it's less of a black box than the human brain is. You can't really look at a human police officer's brain to see what's going on there. But you can often look at the source code for software. It's also often easier to associate things are done with software with reliable audit logs, as opposed to let's say, trusting human analysts to record what they're up to. Software's also less likely to engage in certain abuses that a human might. So one slightly disturbing example of this is, there's this concept, at least in the past, hopefully not in the present, within the NSA of LoveInt, short for love intelligence. The idea is looking at information on a significant other or an ex, and this was apparently common enough that they had jargon for it within the NSA. Seems like something weird has happened if software that you've designed is doing&nbsp;that.</p><p>At the same time, if you're using software in place of humans, it also potentially becomes easier and more efficient to automate a single piece of software, as opposed to auditing lots of different humans who might be replicating this behavior. So if you're using a single piece of software in lots of different cases, then potentially you just look at the single piece as opposed to lots of different human analysts and officers and officials, who might be deviating from protocols. It's also easier to associate a piece of software which is applied in lots of different cases with summary statistics, for example, in accuracy rate, compared to using statistics for humans. I think this is actually a large issue currently with basically surveillance in law enforcement at the moment, is that it seems like intuitively if you're establishing probable cause or reasonable suspicion, there's sort of a probability threshold for that. Exactly how accurate is, for example, an officer's judgment that someone meets these thresholds? What portion of the time are they&nbsp;right?</p><p>For an individual officer, this isn't extremely feasible to collect these statistics, but, for example, using a facial recognition system, you actually have fairly good data on exactly how accurate it is. You can actually have a fairly informed discussion about what sort of false positive rate is too high. That's a bit hard to have for&nbsp;humans.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/mXJtvg3BCKC8A8eCa6aw6/3e984f6a49d16b20108f191d96e01827/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___11_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/mXJtvg3BCKC8A8eCa6aw6/3e984f6a49d16b20108f191d96e01827/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___11_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/mXJtvg3BCKC8A8eCa6aw6/3e984f6a49d16b20108f191d96e01827/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___11_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/mXJtvg3BCKC8A8eCa6aw6/3e984f6a49d16b20108f191d96e01827/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___11_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/mXJtvg3BCKC8A8eCa6aw6/3e984f6a49d16b20108f191d96e01827/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___11_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/mXJtvg3BCKC8A8eCa6aw6/3e984f6a49d16b20108f191d96e01827/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___11_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/mXJtvg3BCKC8A8eCa6aw6/3e984f6a49d16b20108f191d96e01827/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___11_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>A couple of less obvious advantages are that increasing automation can actually decrease the need for data collection, and that increasing automation can decrease the disruptiveness of engaging in auditing.

And just in the past decade or so, it became much more practical to use. A couple of examples of how this technology can be used: so the first is the idea of a set intersection search. This comes up fairly commonly in law enforcement contexts, where you want to identify someone that's suspicious on the basis of the fact that they show up in a few different&nbsp;databases.</p><p>A concrete example is, say someone robs a few different banks. Police know it's the same person, but they don't know who it is. They might want to search the cell records for the cell towers that were near all three of the banks to see if anyone made calls near all three of them. The way you would traditionally do this, in a way that actually historically has been done, is to collect all of the records from these three cell towers, get tens of thousands of people's records, and then comb through them and see if any name pops up three&nbsp;times.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/68gx3mnzS8yIOcMMa8qmQ4/c6d023feeab6604dba05a8ea34468f7a/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___13_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/68gx3mnzS8yIOcMMa8qmQ4/c6d023feeab6604dba05a8ea34468f7a/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___13_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/68gx3mnzS8yIOcMMa8qmQ4/c6d023feeab6604dba05a8ea34468f7a/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___13_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/68gx3mnzS8yIOcMMa8qmQ4/c6d023feeab6604dba05a8ea34468f7a/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___13_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/68gx3mnzS8yIOcMMa8qmQ4/c6d023feeab6604dba05a8ea34468f7a/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___13_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/68gx3mnzS8yIOcMMa8qmQ4/c6d023feeab6604dba05a8ea34468f7a/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___13_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/68gx3mnzS8yIOcMMa8qmQ4/c6d023feeab6604dba05a8ea34468f7a/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___13_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>But it's actually possible to do this without mass collecting records at all. So there's a paper in 2014, that shows how to conduct a search of this sort, where you get out a list of names that appear in all three of these databases, but you don't get any other information besides just those names. So rather than collecting tens of thousands of people's information, you collect maybe one or two. Another example is fraud detection. So for the case of value added fraud detection, one way you sometimes do this is by finding discrepancies between different companies' private financial records. One, let's say, reports a purchase, that doesn't match another country's report of a sale. There's a paper in 2015 that describes a protocol that I believe has actually now been used by the Estonian government to find cases of tax fraud of this sort, without collecting companies' private financial records. They get this output of here are the discrepancies, but they don't actually get any unencrypted records, so they can't learn anything else other than just who is showing&nbsp;discrepancies.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4WDszdYUoMumOuUSyS8mMU/55564d2ad808ba836c1585e9fab0cf59/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___14_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4WDszdYUoMumOuUSyS8mMU/55564d2ad808ba836c1585e9fab0cf59/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___14_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4WDszdYUoMumOuUSyS8mMU/55564d2ad808ba836c1585e9fab0cf59/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___14_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4WDszdYUoMumOuUSyS8mMU/55564d2ad808ba836c1585e9fab0cf59/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___14_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4WDszdYUoMumOuUSyS8mMU/55564d2ad808ba836c1585e9fab0cf59/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___14_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4WDszdYUoMumOuUSyS8mMU/55564d2ad808ba836c1585e9fab0cf59/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___14_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4WDszdYUoMumOuUSyS8mMU/55564d2ad808ba836c1585e9fab0cf59/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___14_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Another example, which I'm also not going to get into the technical details of, is this idea, traceable to a paper by Joshua Kroll in 2016, to use a cryptographic technology called zero knowledge proofs to produce accountable algorithms. The basic upshot is that he shows that it's possible in many cases to prove to the public that a protocol that's received their approval is still being applied. You can prove that people aren't straying from the protocol, and also that the protocol has certain desirable formal properties, for example, fairness properties, without actually making the protocol's details public. So that's desirable, if the reason for not making the details of a protocol public are that you can say, oh, if we made them public, people could get around it, or potentially you're a law enforcement agency and you can't make the details public because some private company has developed it for you and it's quite profitable. So this is a way of making things more accountable while dodging those objections that making yourself more accountable would make you less&nbsp;effective.</p><h2>Conclusions</h2><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6dPxgCNz8Wg0IymUEyOIK6/f6a989832d3a1625fbc424a2cf1bf825/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___15_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6dPxgCNz8Wg0IymUEyOIK6/f6a989832d3a1625fbc424a2cf1bf825/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___15_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6dPxgCNz8Wg0IymUEyOIK6/f6a989832d3a1625fbc424a2cf1bf825/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___15_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6dPxgCNz8Wg0IymUEyOIK6/f6a989832d3a1625fbc424a2cf1bf825/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___15_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6dPxgCNz8Wg0IymUEyOIK6/f6a989832d3a1625fbc424a2cf1bf825/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___15_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6dPxgCNz8Wg0IymUEyOIK6/f6a989832d3a1625fbc424a2cf1bf825/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___15_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6dPxgCNz8Wg0IymUEyOIK6/f6a989832d3a1625fbc424a2cf1bf825/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___15_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>So in my fairly non-expert view, I see a few opportunities for things effective altruists could add to the conversation around surveillance. One is that in my opinion, the conversation is typically too focused on managing trade offs. For example, debating exactly how much security you can get by trading away this amount of privacy, or sometimes denying that these trade offs exist to any extent, which seems implausible. Rather, I think it'd be more useful to look ahead to technical solutions for actually reducing these trade offs. Another concern I have is that a lot of the conversation concerns current programs, or programs which are just getting off the ground. I think it would also be productive to have a conversation about what forms of surveillance we might want to be moving toward, let's say over a 10 or 20 year period, as new risks emerge, and also as new technologies make different forms of surveillance feasible.</p><p>And then the last one is that I think discussions of surveillance are ofte reliant on assumptions about technology which aren't actually true or are going to become less true in the future. So a classic one is that analyzing data actually requires collecting data, which isn't actually technically&nbsp;true.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3gwIH7CasM0eoQYUIEGq0I/4f0c94db2e61972cdde3f1903caa0dc0/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___16_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3gwIH7CasM0eoQYUIEGq0I/4f0c94db2e61972cdde3f1903caa0dc0/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___16_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3gwIH7CasM0eoQYUIEGq0I/4f0c94db2e61972cdde3f1903caa0dc0/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___16_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3gwIH7CasM0eoQYUIEGq0I/4f0c94db2e61972cdde3f1903caa0dc0/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___16_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3gwIH7CasM0eoQYUIEGq0I/4f0c94db2e61972cdde3f1903caa0dc0/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___16_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3gwIH7CasM0eoQYUIEGq0I/4f0c94db2e61972cdde3f1903caa0dc0/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___16_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3gwIH7CasM0eoQYUIEGq0I/4f0c94db2e61972cdde3f1903caa0dc0/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___16_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>One last comment is that this presentation has been all about mass surveillance, but a lot of what I've said also applies to the case of agreement verification in an international relations context. So, the idea here is that frequently you want to verify compliance with an agreement, let's say an arms agreement, but often the process of monitoring the country or verifying compliance involves collecting lots of sensitive or private&nbsp;information.</p><p>So for example, arms agreement auditing might give away details of weapons systems or allow countries access to private actors' labs that might contain valuable intellectual property. And if you can find ways to make more privacy preserving forms of monitoring in the same way, you can make more privacy preserving forms of surveillance, and this could potentially reduce the bottleneck on the ability to actually reach international agreements. This is also something that seems to intersect a lot with existing effective altruist concerns around global catastrophic risks and governance of emerging&nbsp;technologies.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3a1N1918y48gUuAKKKc8sY/3c0a1bbe0a6d785d423ee38a748287a7/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___17_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3a1N1918y48gUuAKKKc8sY/3c0a1bbe0a6d785d423ee38a748287a7/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___17_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3a1N1918y48gUuAKKKc8sY/3c0a1bbe0a6d785d423ee38a748287a7/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___17_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3a1N1918y48gUuAKKKc8sY/3c0a1bbe0a6d785d423ee38a748287a7/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___17_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3a1N1918y48gUuAKKKc8sY/3c0a1bbe0a6d785d423ee38a748287a7/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___17_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3a1N1918y48gUuAKKKc8sY/3c0a1bbe0a6d785d423ee38a748287a7/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___17_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3a1N1918y48gUuAKKKc8sY/3c0a1bbe0a6d785d423ee38a748287a7/EAG_presentation__Ben_Garfinkel___17_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>To close, in the future, surveillance might threaten the institutions that we care about, or it might fail to protect us from new threats. It seems like there's some sort of trade off between addressing these risks, but these trade offs also don't seem to be immutable. There is some hope that in the future, technological progress can help reduce these for us. So therefore it seems like the project of pursuing accountablem, privacy-preserving surveillance, while not something that many people are engaging in at the moment, might be something that more effective altruists want to look into or signal boost in conversations around&nbsp;surveillance.</p>", "user": {"username": "The Centre for Effective Altruism"}}, {"_id": "iGpTbyXm3xtHQFhQ7", "title": "Tyler John: Personhood initiatives", "postedAt": "2018-06-08T07:51:00.000Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RznIFm_Ee4&amp;list=PLwp9xeoX5p8P3cDQwlyN7qsFhC9Ms4L5W&amp;index=9\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/0RznIFm_Ee4\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><hr><p><i>Should certain highly intelligent animals, like chimpanzees, orangutans or elephants have legally recognized rights?

So I'd like to start with one of those. In May of 2018, New York state's highest court denied the Nonhuman Rights Project leave for appeal, refusing to review an earlier decision made by a lower court that did not grant a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> to two chimpanzees, Tommy and Kiko. Following a five year campaign between the Nonhuman Rights Project and each of New York's four intermediate appellate regional courts in which these courts, too, refused to grant a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> relief to Tommy and Kiko, two chimpanzees, which would release them from confinement and move them into sanctuary. And so this means that the Nonhuman Rights Project needs to push their case again before the&nbsp;court.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4sbGiQUvdYYKU0KesWoqyK/6873ea3200b8a7777c604984ab5c0b4e/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4sbGiQUvdYYKU0KesWoqyK/6873ea3200b8a7777c604984ab5c0b4e/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4sbGiQUvdYYKU0KesWoqyK/6873ea3200b8a7777c604984ab5c0b4e/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4sbGiQUvdYYKU0KesWoqyK/6873ea3200b8a7777c604984ab5c0b4e/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4sbGiQUvdYYKU0KesWoqyK/6873ea3200b8a7777c604984ab5c0b4e/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4sbGiQUvdYYKU0KesWoqyK/6873ea3200b8a7777c604984ab5c0b4e/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4sbGiQUvdYYKU0KesWoqyK/6873ea3200b8a7777c604984ab5c0b4e/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Tommy and Kiko have to wait even longer to be moved from captivity into sanctuary, and moreover New York's case law remains unchanged. However, along with this decision came an opinion from Judge Fahey, which was really quite striking in its content, and the opinion stated that the decision not to grant leave to appeal to the Nonhuman Rights Project was not based on the merits of the Nonhuman Rights Project's claim. In fact, moreover, he argued that the legal system really needs to grapple with questions of whether nonhuman animals can be granted a fundamental right to liberty and can be graned a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> for relief from confinement. And more striking still, he argued that the status of nonhuman animals as property under the law is a manifest injustice and that while it may be arguable that a chimpanzee is not a person, there's no doubt that it's not merely a&nbsp;thing.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1PwcjCNlXCWcg2KQcCWK2w/e92bec3c4bf7fdef06349c3bba065a44/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__1_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1PwcjCNlXCWcg2KQcCWK2w/e92bec3c4bf7fdef06349c3bba065a44/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__1_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1PwcjCNlXCWcg2KQcCWK2w/e92bec3c4bf7fdef06349c3bba065a44/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__1_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1PwcjCNlXCWcg2KQcCWK2w/e92bec3c4bf7fdef06349c3bba065a44/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__1_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1PwcjCNlXCWcg2KQcCWK2w/e92bec3c4bf7fdef06349c3bba065a44/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__1_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1PwcjCNlXCWcg2KQcCWK2w/e92bec3c4bf7fdef06349c3bba065a44/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__1_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1PwcjCNlXCWcg2KQcCWK2w/e92bec3c4bf7fdef06349c3bba065a44/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__1_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>This came after an earlier decision in the intermediate appellate courts from Barbara Jaffe, which was also striking in its content, arguing that whether one is a human is not relevant to whether one is a person under the law. And that ultimately questions about personhood will be decided not by facts about biology, but facts about public policy and principle. These opinions create precedent within the court system and greatly increase the probability of the success of future personhood initiatives to grant fundamental legal rights for chimpanzees and other&nbsp;animals.</p><p>So what I'd like to talk about today is how we can evaluate the altruistic efficacy of campaigns such as these, and how we can start to think about comparing them to other kinds of interventions we can form that have caused more direct measurable change in the world, as well as other interventions which have a much more long-term systemic structural impact in the world, just like these kinds of campaigns. There's a lot of inherent uncertainty when we're thinking about shaping the far future with structural distributed interventions. And I think that there's room for a lot of reasonable disagreement with these issues, but that by reasoning qualitatively about some of the considerations that are in play, we can make progress and think about how to evaluate some of these kinds of&nbsp;interventions.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3z5m421SQ8wSsiMuygmYgo/dd29b79728a89ddfd5a9cd9c11933f2f/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__2_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3z5m421SQ8wSsiMuygmYgo/dd29b79728a89ddfd5a9cd9c11933f2f/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__2_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3z5m421SQ8wSsiMuygmYgo/dd29b79728a89ddfd5a9cd9c11933f2f/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__2_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3z5m421SQ8wSsiMuygmYgo/dd29b79728a89ddfd5a9cd9c11933f2f/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__2_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3z5m421SQ8wSsiMuygmYgo/dd29b79728a89ddfd5a9cd9c11933f2f/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__2_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3z5m421SQ8wSsiMuygmYgo/dd29b79728a89ddfd5a9cd9c11933f2f/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__2_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3z5m421SQ8wSsiMuygmYgo/dd29b79728a89ddfd5a9cd9c11933f2f/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__2_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>So, I will be reasoning qualitatively for the case for long-termism, the case from long-termism to moral circle expansion and the case from moral circle expansion to personhood&nbsp;initiatives.</p><h2>Understanding Personhood Initiatives</h2><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/276Y1PxcusMSimCI6IEOSC/b767d840b2174e9e7713ecf3169ba5ae/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__3_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/276Y1PxcusMSimCI6IEOSC/b767d840b2174e9e7713ecf3169ba5ae/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__3_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/276Y1PxcusMSimCI6IEOSC/b767d840b2174e9e7713ecf3169ba5ae/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__3_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/276Y1PxcusMSimCI6IEOSC/b767d840b2174e9e7713ecf3169ba5ae/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__3_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/276Y1PxcusMSimCI6IEOSC/b767d840b2174e9e7713ecf3169ba5ae/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__3_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/276Y1PxcusMSimCI6IEOSC/b767d840b2174e9e7713ecf3169ba5ae/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__3_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/276Y1PxcusMSimCI6IEOSC/b767d840b2174e9e7713ecf3169ba5ae/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__3_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>So, to get us started, I want to characterize what these personhood initiatives are. They are judicial and legislative initiatives aimed at establishing fundamental rights for nonhuman animals. And so they're concerned with rights law rather than welfare law. And the difference here is one of content. So welfare law concerns the treatment of nonhuman animals - or human beings - under conditions of domination and control. So, the conditions of animals in laboratories and on farms for example. Whereas rights laws prohibit domination and control in the first place, and they concern things like right to bodily liberty, noninterference, mental and bodily integrity and so on. And so I'll characterize personhood initiatives as any of these initiatives that are trying to shape rights law, through legal interventions, and through legal means.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/Bupv62bOuGioE2u84IswS/f38fcfc841060fa7f4b613c21e4321ca/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__4_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/Bupv62bOuGioE2u84IswS/f38fcfc841060fa7f4b613c21e4321ca/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__4_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/Bupv62bOuGioE2u84IswS/f38fcfc841060fa7f4b613c21e4321ca/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__4_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/Bupv62bOuGioE2u84IswS/f38fcfc841060fa7f4b613c21e4321ca/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__4_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/Bupv62bOuGioE2u84IswS/f38fcfc841060fa7f4b613c21e4321ca/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__4_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/Bupv62bOuGioE2u84IswS/f38fcfc841060fa7f4b613c21e4321ca/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__4_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/Bupv62bOuGioE2u84IswS/f38fcfc841060fa7f4b613c21e4321ca/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__4_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>The key players right now that are working on personhood initiatives can be subdivided into two different kinds of approaches. Some go through the court systems which are seeking to pursue writs of <i>habeas corpus</i>, which release individual, particular animals from situations of confinement and establish their fundamental rights, and then legislative initiatives which seek to change the laws in a whole region for a whole group of animals, directly. And so, on the court side of things, the Nonhuman Rights Project, who I mentioned at the beginning, is working in the US. In addition to the work that they've been doing for chimpanzees, they've recently launched an initiative in Connecticut, trying to gain a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> for three elephants who are in the Connecticut&nbsp;zoo.</p><p>The AFADA in Argentina recently, I believe in 2015, won a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> for an orangutan and later won a writ of <i>habeas corpus</i> for a chimpanzee. Currently the state is trying to decide what the content of these rights will be, and how to enforce them, so there's some uncertainty about how things will proceed. It looks like a very promising move for at least these particular animals, if not for the majority of them in the country.

Litigation, however, only concerns particular animals. And so what litigation does is it sets precedent for further litigation and for legislation, and it also legitimates positive legislative ideals, sort of blessing them before the law so that the law can take further steps. And what both of these strategies do, in addition, is they force the state to think less simplistically and more complicatedly about rights law in general, clearing up the confusion about what the purposes of rights are, what they're doing, how they protect individuals, that can pave the way for much more nuanced and expansive protection in the future. That can cover a wide variety of sentient beings in a wide variety of circumstances. It allows the state to digest some of these ideas, which, which will allow for the progress in the&nbsp;future.</p><h2>Why Legal Rights?</h2><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4AEO9e8dw4K4C6k8SuyUic/f6d39d5ec2755f55f5b4a81812fffc55/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__6_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4AEO9e8dw4K4C6k8SuyUic/f6d39d5ec2755f55f5b4a81812fffc55/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__6_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4AEO9e8dw4K4C6k8SuyUic/f6d39d5ec2755f55f5b4a81812fffc55/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__6_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4AEO9e8dw4K4C6k8SuyUic/f6d39d5ec2755f55f5b4a81812fffc55/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__6_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4AEO9e8dw4K4C6k8SuyUic/f6d39d5ec2755f55f5b4a81812fffc55/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__6_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4AEO9e8dw4K4C6k8SuyUic/f6d39d5ec2755f55f5b4a81812fffc55/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__6_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4AEO9e8dw4K4C6k8SuyUic/f6d39d5ec2755f55f5b4a81812fffc55/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__6_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Instead of evaluating whether we should be pursuing litigation or legislation strategies, which animals we should be pursuing rights for, what countries we should be working in, and other important details that we can ensure debate, I'd like to ask the question of why we should pursuing basic legal rights for nonhuman animals in the first place, in order to evaluate the efficacy of these kinds of strategies.

Also, seemingly any future action which could cause the risk of astronomical suffering could be disincentivized through deterrence&nbsp;efforts.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/23AcxgFHSAS24AaomUswO2/46f7ae21480c09582471f9a4c9e544e9/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__13_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/23AcxgFHSAS24AaomUswO2/46f7ae21480c09582471f9a4c9e544e9/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__13_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/23AcxgFHSAS24AaomUswO2/46f7ae21480c09582471f9a4c9e544e9/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__13_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/23AcxgFHSAS24AaomUswO2/46f7ae21480c09582471f9a4c9e544e9/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__13_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/23AcxgFHSAS24AaomUswO2/46f7ae21480c09582471f9a4c9e544e9/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__13_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/23AcxgFHSAS24AaomUswO2/46f7ae21480c09582471f9a4c9e544e9/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__13_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/23AcxgFHSAS24AaomUswO2/46f7ae21480c09582471f9a4c9e544e9/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__13_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Particular legislative acts in the law, and particular legal interventions, also set precedent. In common law systems like the United States, all published decisions in judicial opinions become part of the body of law that constrains the way that judges rule. And this is why the precedents, or the opinions I discussed the beginning of this talk, are so important: because these too become part of the body of law, and the body of decisions that constrains how judges can rule. This is true even at the highest levels. So, for example, in the US, the Supreme Court's decisions are significantly shaped by precedent. The Supreme Court decides which cases they're going to hear, and will not hear cases where they think that there's been a sufficiently good ruling on them already. They won't pick up the cases, dive into them, analyze them, discuss them amongst themselves. And so legal precedent can shape what the Supreme Court hears and does, and it can also make certain laws immutable with increasing time, institutional reliance and political acceptance. Some laws just become too deeply ingrained to be very easy to do something about, through precedent&nbsp;setting.</p><p>And of course, the decisions of courts and other branches of government significantly shape each other's agenda. What one branch does can change what's actionable for another branch, and change what's relevant for another branch. In fact, when courts decide in favor of ascribing certain rights to individuals, such as in the case of Sandra the orangutan in Argentina, oftentimes what the court system will do is they'll hand off the legislation to another government agency who will decide what content this law should have, and how they should employ it. And so this then can change the legislature's priorities as they think about what the structure of these rights should be. And it can also produce positive legal content for the legislatures to use in their&nbsp;legislation.</p><p>And so in all these cases, whether we're using legislative actions or litigatory actions, decisions that courts and other branches make will set precedent for future decisions and allow us to have better, more progressive, more effective laws in the&nbsp;future.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4dhFMg7IBi4O0yW2m2yioS/8d78196a17716accf49ba43016f0d5a1/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__14_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4dhFMg7IBi4O0yW2m2yioS/8d78196a17716accf49ba43016f0d5a1/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__14_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4dhFMg7IBi4O0yW2m2yioS/8d78196a17716accf49ba43016f0d5a1/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__14_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4dhFMg7IBi4O0yW2m2yioS/8d78196a17716accf49ba43016f0d5a1/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__14_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4dhFMg7IBi4O0yW2m2yioS/8d78196a17716accf49ba43016f0d5a1/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__14_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4dhFMg7IBi4O0yW2m2yioS/8d78196a17716accf49ba43016f0d5a1/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__14_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4dhFMg7IBi4O0yW2m2yioS/8d78196a17716accf49ba43016f0d5a1/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__14_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Finally, and I think most importantly for our purposes, the law can provide institutional signaling that can greatly shape human moral attitudes and behavior. To see if institutional signalling matters, we should ask whether common sense morality is better than it once was because the laws changed, or whether the laws changed because common sense morality is better. Do people discriminate less today because discrimination is legally prohibited? Or does the law prohibit discrimination because we discriminate less, and our values have gotten better? So I think obviously, the the question as posed is not a good one. We would expect the relationship between the law and morality to be bidirectional. Morality influences the law and law influences morality. But I'm going to be arguing, giving some reasons to favor the latter thesis, to think that the law can significantly change people's&nbsp;morality.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/bmWNlTA1QOCWWC8GqG4ck/764289272fac5208cc982e3b49fc16c1/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__15_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/bmWNlTA1QOCWWC8GqG4ck/764289272fac5208cc982e3b49fc16c1/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__15_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/bmWNlTA1QOCWWC8GqG4ck/764289272fac5208cc982e3b49fc16c1/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__15_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/bmWNlTA1QOCWWC8GqG4ck/764289272fac5208cc982e3b49fc16c1/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__15_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/bmWNlTA1QOCWWC8GqG4ck/764289272fac5208cc982e3b49fc16c1/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__15_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/bmWNlTA1QOCWWC8GqG4ck/764289272fac5208cc982e3b49fc16c1/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__15_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/bmWNlTA1QOCWWC8GqG4ck/764289272fac5208cc982e3b49fc16c1/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__15_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>So one way in which the law can shape human morality and moral behavior, is by being a persuasive source of morality for people to uptake. Because society is diverse and different people are offering you different moral judgments all the time: your peers, your parents, your faith communities and political parties, and everyone around you seems to disagree about morality, the law may be a particularly powerful source for shaping and sustaining moral norms. Since law is a common denominator that holds across all citizens, unless a particular issue is very divisive and contentious in the law. But to the degree that it is a common denominator among citizens, the law may be a very powerful source for shaping morality. And if this thesis is right, then the informational influence of the law is likely to be a heuristic process, affecting our system two reasoning, such that the informational content of the law is invoked in our intuitive common sense moral judgments that we make in everyday&nbsp;cases.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6lPKqp0dvU0cIAKcmyWMos/d17e3acc7442d7de73ca0ebf55ae6472/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__16_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6lPKqp0dvU0cIAKcmyWMos/d17e3acc7442d7de73ca0ebf55ae6472/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__16_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6lPKqp0dvU0cIAKcmyWMos/d17e3acc7442d7de73ca0ebf55ae6472/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__16_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6lPKqp0dvU0cIAKcmyWMos/d17e3acc7442d7de73ca0ebf55ae6472/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__16_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6lPKqp0dvU0cIAKcmyWMos/d17e3acc7442d7de73ca0ebf55ae6472/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__16_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6lPKqp0dvU0cIAKcmyWMos/d17e3acc7442d7de73ca0ebf55ae6472/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__16_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6lPKqp0dvU0cIAKcmyWMos/d17e3acc7442d7de73ca0ebf55ae6472/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__16_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Now, I think this view is plausible on reflection, but not a lot of research has been done to understand it and see whether this is actually a way that morality is shaped. The evidence is pretty thin. The two best known empirical studies, which are studies in which people were asked to judge the morality of a bunch of unsavory behaviors, are highly inconclusive. In these cases, what the study participants were asked is whether certain behaviors were right and wrong, and then they were told the action was either legal or illegal, and there was some change in people's perceptions of the morality of these actions based on whether they were legal or illegal. They were more likely to judge them as immoral if they were illegal, as one would expect. But as Nigel Walker, one of the study authors himself has pointed out, a lot of this data might be explained in terms of the fact that there were some conscientious law abiding citizens in the room who thought that some actions that are illegal can be wrong in virtue of the fact that they are illegal. So, when certain people are told that an action is illegal, they then decide it's morally wrong because breaking the law itself is morally&nbsp;wrong.</p><p>So, we don't have a lot of evidence for the persuasive source of morality view of the law. But these particular studies, and a bunch of other studies, also do show a much stronger effect of perceived peer opinion on morality. So one thing that these studies did show was that when they, in a separate variable condition, when participants were told that their peers strongly believed that certain actions were moral or immoral, this greatly updated people's perceptions of the morality of these actions. And so I think that the law can play a very effective role in shaping moral attitudes and behavior by representing group attitudes as being a particular&nbsp;way.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2BIjKYzAQUgUWUaKKUGIgk/3a182df69036c86dbb3f158f636d5760/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__17_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2BIjKYzAQUgUWUaKKUGIgk/3a182df69036c86dbb3f158f636d5760/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__17_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2BIjKYzAQUgUWUaKKUGIgk/3a182df69036c86dbb3f158f636d5760/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__17_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2BIjKYzAQUgUWUaKKUGIgk/3a182df69036c86dbb3f158f636d5760/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__17_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2BIjKYzAQUgUWUaKKUGIgk/3a182df69036c86dbb3f158f636d5760/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__17_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2BIjKYzAQUgUWUaKKUGIgk/3a182df69036c86dbb3f158f636d5760/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__17_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2BIjKYzAQUgUWUaKKUGIgk/3a182df69036c86dbb3f158f636d5760/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__17_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Because social norms strongly anchor human moral attitudes and behavior, the law can shape morality by shaping what's perceived as group norms and attitudes. This can happen directly when group members infer that a certain level of momentum must exist in order to support the change that has happened. We can see this in two separate studies that Tankard and Paluck recently performed on Supreme Court rulings on gay marriage. Here they found robust evidence that the Supreme Court ruling legalizing gay marriage was associated with significant shifts in perceived present and future social norms in support of gay&nbsp;marriage.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/57MmJVZzc40QEMmOQ44m62/24f3122a45de5c04123b9d24e81821a0/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__18_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/57MmJVZzc40QEMmOQ44m62/24f3122a45de5c04123b9d24e81821a0/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__18_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/57MmJVZzc40QEMmOQ44m62/24f3122a45de5c04123b9d24e81821a0/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__18_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/57MmJVZzc40QEMmOQ44m62/24f3122a45de5c04123b9d24e81821a0/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__18_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/57MmJVZzc40QEMmOQ44m62/24f3122a45de5c04123b9d24e81821a0/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__18_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/57MmJVZzc40QEMmOQ44m62/24f3122a45de5c04123b9d24e81821a0/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__18_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/57MmJVZzc40QEMmOQ44m62/24f3122a45de5c04123b9d24e81821a0/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__18_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>So, these two studies, the second study was a study in which they performed five separate Mturk studies. The first three studies happened before the Supreme Court ruling in favor of gay marriage and the last two Mturk studies happened after it, and they found that study participants evaluating the morality of gay marriage and evaluating the positivity of gay rights updated strongly on pure opinion after the Supreme Court ruling on gay marriage. They strongly improved their belief that the public supported gay marriage and was moving in a direction that was more supportive of gay&nbsp;marriage.</p><p>A different study used a different technique, and what they did was they gave fake articles to study participants that were either predicting a really strong landslide win in favor of gay marriage or one really strongly against gay marriage and evaluated candidates' attitudes towards gay marriage and gay rights in this context. And this one found that people who were given a positive ruling in these articles not only perceived a much greater status quo norm in favor of gay rights and much stronger directional norms in favor of it, but their personal attitudes towards gay marriage were also much more positive, and their feelings towards gay people on a feeling thermometer were also much more&nbsp;positive.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6G7C3T9K9yIgsoU4sGWOsy/56d4fcf8128f28ec047f3c8f1f431a4c/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__19_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6G7C3T9K9yIgsoU4sGWOsy/56d4fcf8128f28ec047f3c8f1f431a4c/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__19_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6G7C3T9K9yIgsoU4sGWOsy/56d4fcf8128f28ec047f3c8f1f431a4c/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__19_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6G7C3T9K9yIgsoU4sGWOsy/56d4fcf8128f28ec047f3c8f1f431a4c/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__19_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6G7C3T9K9yIgsoU4sGWOsy/56d4fcf8128f28ec047f3c8f1f431a4c/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__19_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6G7C3T9K9yIgsoU4sGWOsy/56d4fcf8128f28ec047f3c8f1f431a4c/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__19_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6G7C3T9K9yIgsoU4sGWOsy/56d4fcf8128f28ec047f3c8f1f431a4c/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__19_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>So this study strongly suggests not only that the law can shape what's perceived as pure opinion and group norms, but also people's own moral attitudes. Flores and Barclay similarly found a massive increase in pro gay-rights attitudes immediately following an earlier Supreme Court ruling, which importantly didn't have any backlash either. And I won't go through this study very much, but you can see looking at the transitional probabilities that in a number of states there were very, very large updates from people who are opposed to gay rights to becoming ambivalent about gay rights. In some states, 24 percent of people who were opposed became ambivalent, and in some 47 percent who opposed became ambivalent. And there was also a minority of participants who updated in favor from being ambivalent about gay rights to favoring them as well.

People don't know why they're acting this way, but, but they assume automatically that the reason people were acting this way is because they want to. Because that's what good people, responsible people do. And so when people discriminate less, or they eat less meat, or perform any behavior that may become incentivized by the law, people assume that they're doing that because they want to, and that's what good people do.

So, the law can be more influential on norms and behavior when, number three, individuals' personal views are closer to the new normative information, which I think points positively in favor of a goalpost shifting strategy, which starts with more low hanging legal fruit. When we update society's morality in a direction that's favorable to the rights of nonhuman animals, we can then pursue increasingly more progressive legal initiatives. Taking people's personal views iterated closer and closer to the more progressive legal wins. For when new normative information is widely shared, which I think suggests the importance of mass media mobilization surrounding legal campaigns, and six, when political movements coexist to mobilize individuals following a decision, which I think suggests the importance of large amounts of grassroots mobilization around legal&nbsp;initiatives.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3sAQmhcICQg0UKYQgisswy/71e65ea97418b601cf42bf08013b630d/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__22_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3sAQmhcICQg0UKYQgisswy/71e65ea97418b601cf42bf08013b630d/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__22_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3sAQmhcICQg0UKYQgisswy/71e65ea97418b601cf42bf08013b630d/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__22_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3sAQmhcICQg0UKYQgisswy/71e65ea97418b601cf42bf08013b630d/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__22_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3sAQmhcICQg0UKYQgisswy/71e65ea97418b601cf42bf08013b630d/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__22_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3sAQmhcICQg0UKYQgisswy/71e65ea97418b601cf42bf08013b630d/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__22_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3sAQmhcICQg0UKYQgisswy/71e65ea97418b601cf42bf08013b630d/Shaping_the_Far_Future_with_Personhood_Initiatives__22_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>And so all of this suggests that we should be pluralistic in our approach to advocacy, employing legal interventions alongside grassroots, mass media mobilization, and through a combination of precedent setting and norm and attitude change, iterated person initiatives and other legal interventions can progressively shape the law and moral attitudes, establishing increasingly progressive basic rights for sentient beings. And we can expect this in turn, for the reasons I've discussed, to increasingly expand humanity's moral circle. So I've got some conclusions here, but I've already run over by a little bit.

I mean, my suspicion is that they do work in concert. Welfare laws do increase people's moral sentiments towards nonhuman animals and create momentum for further legal wins. I think there's increasing consensus in the effective animal advocacy movement that that is indeed the case. And for that reason, we can expect these to increase the likelihood of success of establishing basic legal rights for nonhuman animals. So I think they do work in concert. But there's still a question of which of these strategies should we be prioritizing more heavily. And that's a question that I feel ill-equipped to answer. But we should be prioritizing both of them much more heavily than we currently&nbsp;are.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> Are there risks with personhood being legally expanded to include animals, if there are times when significant welfare improvements for animals would come into conflict with those laws? For example: say you give personhood rights to dolphins, then maybe the conditions surrounding that would require you to factory farm more fish to feed&nbsp;them.</p><p><strong>Tyler:</strong> Okay. I think you're going in a different direction with this. A lot of these basic legal protections are in favor of things like autonomy and bodily liberty. If we give a large amount of autonomy and bodily liberty to nonhuman animals, where you leave them too much to their own devices, to make their own decisions, it gives us fewer grounds for paternalism and supporting their welfare against their own preferences. And so, liberal rights could also come into conflict with welfare in that case. I think if this is the kind of idea we have here, we do need to balance the autonomy we give for indirect moral circumspection kinds of reasons, and the direct welfare benefits of paternalistic interventions. And I think this is a question just to be worked out in the, in the decision about what kinds of laws we codify and how much paternalism we allow, given the basic rights that we ascribe to nonhuman&nbsp;animals.</p>", "user": {"username": "The Centre for Effective Altruism"}}, {"_id": "rb6kqchA8B5zcrtCf", "title": "Spencer Greenberg: Value traps, and how to avoid them", "postedAt": "2018-06-08T07:51:00.000Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d_6i9uzsBuc&amp;list=PLwp9xeoX5p8P3cDQwlyN7qsFhC9Ms4L5W&amp;index=8\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_6i9uzsBuc\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><hr><p><i>What do we really value?

I'm seeing a lot of nos out there. So why do we care about money? Well, money lets us do things like buy a car, or buy food. Buying a car might give us autonomy; buying food might give us nourishment and pleasure. But imagine we were in an economy with hyper-inflation where you literally couldn't use the money for anything, it basically becomes paper at that point and we can't get any of the things we want out of it. I think in that case, most people would say it actually has no value. So I would say money is not an intrinsic value, because it doesn't get us anything.

But every once in a while we look out in the distance and we think: What the heck are we trying to get to? Why are we doing all this rowing? Where are we going? And that's kind of what our intrinsic values are&nbsp;like.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6r2cJMdxXGKCokOEgEYCYi/63157b21decf0b35668155cd8a61c766/Intrinsic_Values_5.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6r2cJMdxXGKCokOEgEYCYi/63157b21decf0b35668155cd8a61c766/Intrinsic_Values_5.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6r2cJMdxXGKCokOEgEYCYi/63157b21decf0b35668155cd8a61c766/Intrinsic_Values_5.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6r2cJMdxXGKCokOEgEYCYi/63157b21decf0b35668155cd8a61c766/Intrinsic_Values_5.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6r2cJMdxXGKCokOEgEYCYi/63157b21decf0b35668155cd8a61c766/Intrinsic_Values_5.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6r2cJMdxXGKCokOEgEYCYi/63157b21decf0b35668155cd8a61c766/Intrinsic_Values_5.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6r2cJMdxXGKCokOEgEYCYi/63157b21decf0b35668155cd8a61c766/Intrinsic_Values_5.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>So we've defined intrinsic values so far in relation to the things we value. But we haven't really talked about what it means to value something. So let's talk about that a little. Well first, a question for you. In the video game Pacman, do ghosts have the value of catching&nbsp;Pacman?</p><p>A lot of uncertainty in this audience. Well, I think it depends on your perspective. One way to think about a value is as a model of an agent's behavior. And insofar as the chosen model is good, you could think of the agent as having that value. A second way to think about a value is, it's something that's part of an agent's utility function. Now imagine that Pacman had been implemented in the hot days of AI that we're in right now, and they might've used machine learning to develop the ghosts' \"internal brains\". And if they did that, the ghosts might literally have a utility function, and there might be a machine learning algorithm that's trying to optimize closeness to Pacman. And in that case we could really say that maybe it really does have the value of catching Pacman, in some&nbsp;sense.</p><p>But from the point of view of this talk, my preferred perspective is a little bit different. It's that valuing is something our brains do, so there's something that it feels like to have a value. And in that sense, the ghosts do not have value. Intrinsic values then become a subset of the things we&nbsp;value.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/u4EuN0W4ScGQoOkuCeEOq/538d857c102eea21d04c83110802a411/Intrinsic_Values_6.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/u4EuN0W4ScGQoOkuCeEOq/538d857c102eea21d04c83110802a411/Intrinsic_Values_6.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/u4EuN0W4ScGQoOkuCeEOq/538d857c102eea21d04c83110802a411/Intrinsic_Values_6.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/u4EuN0W4ScGQoOkuCeEOq/538d857c102eea21d04c83110802a411/Intrinsic_Values_6.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/u4EuN0W4ScGQoOkuCeEOq/538d857c102eea21d04c83110802a411/Intrinsic_Values_6.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/u4EuN0W4ScGQoOkuCeEOq/538d857c102eea21d04c83110802a411/Intrinsic_Values_6.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/u4EuN0W4ScGQoOkuCeEOq/538d857c102eea21d04c83110802a411/Intrinsic_Values_6.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Let's think about this for a second as though our brains are machines, which in many ways they are. So our brains have this operation that is \"valuable\" that they can assign to things. So you could look at a stone and say, \"That is not valuable.\" You could look at money and say, \"That's valuable.\" But oh wait, if I think about all the reasons I find it valuable it turns out that they're just because of the effects. So if I'm not allowed to get those effects - it's not valuable. So it's valuable but not an intrinsic value. And then there might be other things that you look at and you say: That's intrinsically valuable. Or maybe when you reflect on them, you think they are intrinsically&nbsp;valuable.</p><p>So what's the point of all this? Why try to understand our intrinsic values?

A value trap is when there's something that you associate with intrinsic value, or that might in the past have been related to an intrinsic value of yours, so you seek after it. But then it doesn't end up giving you the thing that you actually intrinsically value in the&nbsp;long-run.</p><p>So imagine someone who takes a high paying career in finance, and the reason they take it is because when they're young, they associate lack of money with lack of autonomy, and they really value autonomy. So they go and they take this career, but after working their ass off for 30 years, they suddenly realize they've actually given up their autonomy. Early on, it was associated with the intrinsic value. But it stopped being associated, and through inertia the person kept doing it. So they fell in a value&nbsp;trap.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5dgUvQCDSMw66gucm6KYyq/7c665990d2585c10b45634e476465710/Intrinsic_Values_8.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5dgUvQCDSMw66gucm6KYyq/7c665990d2585c10b45634e476465710/Intrinsic_Values_8.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5dgUvQCDSMw66gucm6KYyq/7c665990d2585c10b45634e476465710/Intrinsic_Values_8.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5dgUvQCDSMw66gucm6KYyq/7c665990d2585c10b45634e476465710/Intrinsic_Values_8.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5dgUvQCDSMw66gucm6KYyq/7c665990d2585c10b45634e476465710/Intrinsic_Values_8.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5dgUvQCDSMw66gucm6KYyq/7c665990d2585c10b45634e476465710/Intrinsic_Values_8.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5dgUvQCDSMw66gucm6KYyq/7c665990d2585c10b45634e476465710/Intrinsic_Values_8.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>A <strong>second</strong> reason to care about your intrinsic values is to help you optimize your plans. For example, maybe we have this deep intrinsic value of deepening our understanding of the world. And we associate this with being a tenured professor. But maybe we don't realize that that's why we want to be a tenured professor, right? So we come up with this elaborate plan: I'm going to go get my master's degree, I'm going to get my PhD, I'm going to get my post doc, and eventually I'll become a tenured professor. But maybe there's a much more efficient route to this plan, like just spending your free time doing the deep learning you want to do. Maybe this is going to get you most of what you want in much less effort. This, of course, is related to CFAR's goal factoring techniques, if you've ever done a Center for Applied Rationality&nbsp;workshop.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7pZJ7Yk6C4ky6i4MoSC6SW/07363de801313aa3b7ab057dd920f6ec/Intrinsic_Values_9.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7pZJ7Yk6C4ky6i4MoSC6SW/07363de801313aa3b7ab057dd920f6ec/Intrinsic_Values_9.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7pZJ7Yk6C4ky6i4MoSC6SW/07363de801313aa3b7ab057dd920f6ec/Intrinsic_Values_9.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7pZJ7Yk6C4ky6i4MoSC6SW/07363de801313aa3b7ab057dd920f6ec/Intrinsic_Values_9.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7pZJ7Yk6C4ky6i4MoSC6SW/07363de801313aa3b7ab057dd920f6ec/Intrinsic_Values_9.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7pZJ7Yk6C4ky6i4MoSC6SW/07363de801313aa3b7ab057dd920f6ec/Intrinsic_Values_9.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7pZJ7Yk6C4ky6i4MoSC6SW/07363de801313aa3b7ab057dd920f6ec/Intrinsic_Values_9.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>A <strong>third</strong> reason to try to understand your intrinsic values is that it can help you understand or educe an unhelpful social guilt that people often have. As you grow up, people tell you about what's valuable. Your parents do, your friends do. Even as an adult, the social circles around you are teaching you about what's valuable. But what happens if your intrinsic values differ from what the people around you tell you is valuable? Well, I think it could lead to a lot of weird psychological&nbsp;effects.</p><p>You feel guilty, you feel like you're a bad person, you feel like you're an imposter. But you can take a step back and start reframing this in terms of intrinsic values and say, \"Huh, my intrinsic values that I have may just be different than those of the people around me. My parents might have taught me to respect authority, maybe my friend group teaches me that I should be pure, according to some definition of pure, but maybe I just wanna maximize global utility\", or something like this. So you end up in a situation where you have different intrinsic values. And once you realize that, you're like, \"Okay, I'm not a bad person, I'm not an imposter, I just have different intrinsic values.\" And then you might actually be able to relate to your community more&nbsp;successfully.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4cAGCjALJuowSKgOSq6UmE/4a5ef58dd91ed6ce75735ac905109da5/Intrinsic_Values_10.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4cAGCjALJuowSKgOSq6UmE/4a5ef58dd91ed6ce75735ac905109da5/Intrinsic_Values_10.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4cAGCjALJuowSKgOSq6UmE/4a5ef58dd91ed6ce75735ac905109da5/Intrinsic_Values_10.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4cAGCjALJuowSKgOSq6UmE/4a5ef58dd91ed6ce75735ac905109da5/Intrinsic_Values_10.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4cAGCjALJuowSKgOSq6UmE/4a5ef58dd91ed6ce75735ac905109da5/Intrinsic_Values_10.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4cAGCjALJuowSKgOSq6UmE/4a5ef58dd91ed6ce75735ac905109da5/Intrinsic_Values_10.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4cAGCjALJuowSKgOSq6UmE/4a5ef58dd91ed6ce75735ac905109da5/Intrinsic_Values_10.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>A <strong>fourth</strong> reason that I think it could be important to understand your intrinsic values is to reduce a sort of irrational double-think that I've noticed people have sometimes. So, I want to read a couple statements for&nbsp;you:</p><ul><li>\"The reason I cultivate friendship is because it helps me improve the&nbsp;world.\"</li><li>\"The reason I do fun things is so I don't burn out.\"<br>Now I don't know about you, but I don't buy these things. Sure, hypothetically doing fun things might prevent you from burning out, but I don't really think that's why people do fun things almost ever, right? But I do sometimes hear people say things like that. So what's going&nbsp;on?</li></ul><p>Here's my theory: People have multiple intrinsic values, but in their social world, there might be only one or two that are socially acceptable. Or maybe they've studied philosophy and they've convinced themselves that there's only one true universal value that's important. So what happens is they take their own intrinsic values, and they try to shove them onto these acceptable values, and you get really weird things like this. It's kind of a self-deception. I don't think people are intending to be manipulative or anything like that, I think it's a self deception and I think it's potentially&nbsp;bad.</p><p>So I'm going to make a point that I think is very important, which is that what you think you should value, or what you believe is the objective universal truth about value, is not the same as the entirety of what your intrinsic values actually are. So when I'm referring to intrinsic values, I'm talking about an empirical fact about yourself, about your brain. And the moment that you <i>decide</i> that something is a universal value - the one true value - it's not like your brain immediately flips into thinking that's the only thing that's valuable. Right? So those are different things. You might aspire to have your values be a certain way, but it doesn't mean that they are that way. And you might try to shape them to make them more that way, but that's a long process over time, and you'll probably never get fully there&nbsp;anyway.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1UvcyjQi2c2kgo2MWcMaMa/d26da9d998c3059f9f5f51570fc2d308/Intrinsic_Values_11.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1UvcyjQi2c2kgo2MWcMaMa/d26da9d998c3059f9f5f51570fc2d308/Intrinsic_Values_11.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1UvcyjQi2c2kgo2MWcMaMa/d26da9d998c3059f9f5f51570fc2d308/Intrinsic_Values_11.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1UvcyjQi2c2kgo2MWcMaMa/d26da9d998c3059f9f5f51570fc2d308/Intrinsic_Values_11.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1UvcyjQi2c2kgo2MWcMaMa/d26da9d998c3059f9f5f51570fc2d308/Intrinsic_Values_11.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1UvcyjQi2c2kgo2MWcMaMa/d26da9d998c3059f9f5f51570fc2d308/Intrinsic_Values_11.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1UvcyjQi2c2kgo2MWcMaMa/d26da9d998c3059f9f5f51570fc2d308/Intrinsic_Values_11.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>The <strong>fifth</strong> and final reason that I think it's useful to try to understand our intrinsic values is because it can help us figure out, more specifically, what kind of world we want to create. If we're thinking about improving the world on the margin, there are a lot of things we could do that are very obvious, that we could all agree on. We want to reduce disease, we want to make people suffer less, and so on. But when you start thinking about what world you actually want to create, it's insanely hard. If you attempt to do this, and you have one or two primary values you design this world around, I think you'll notice that you get in this really weird situation where you've designed this optimal world and it doesn't <i>feel</i> optimal. And you're like: That's actually a scary world. And you show it to other people and they're even more freaked out by it than you&nbsp;are.</p><p>Why is this? Well, I suspect it's because we have multiple intrinsic values. So if we're sort of focusing on one or two of them, and we try to build an optimal world around that, it ends up being really weird and not feeling like that great a world. This becomes even more important if we're trying to create a world that other people want to live in too; we have to take into account broad spectrum of intrinsic values, and try to work with them to figure out what we want the world to look like. I think it would be really exciting for effective altruism to have more of a positive picture of what kind of world we want to create, and not just a negative picture of the world we're trying to repair. I think that would be an exciting&nbsp;project.</p><h2>How can we learn our intrinsic&nbsp;values?</h2><p>All right, so all this comes with a huge caveat, which is that it's very tricky to figure out actually what your intrinsic values are. We have to check really carefully to make sure we've really found&nbsp;them.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5L3v5U0V8swmiUGeoCsU2o/e261b04c5e71d3f3d9706c8f81f936ef/Intrinsic_Values_12.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5L3v5U0V8swmiUGeoCsU2o/e261b04c5e71d3f3d9706c8f81f936ef/Intrinsic_Values_12.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5L3v5U0V8swmiUGeoCsU2o/e261b04c5e71d3f3d9706c8f81f936ef/Intrinsic_Values_12.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5L3v5U0V8swmiUGeoCsU2o/e261b04c5e71d3f3d9706c8f81f936ef/Intrinsic_Values_12.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5L3v5U0V8swmiUGeoCsU2o/e261b04c5e71d3f3d9706c8f81f936ef/Intrinsic_Values_12.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5L3v5U0V8swmiUGeoCsU2o/e261b04c5e71d3f3d9706c8f81f936ef/Intrinsic_Values_12.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5L3v5U0V8swmiUGeoCsU2o/e261b04c5e71d3f3d9706c8f81f936ef/Intrinsic_Values_12.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>So for example, let's say you're trying to decide if you value a huge pile of gold coins. And in doing the thought experiment to see whether it's a value or an intrinsic value, you've properly screened off the fact that you're not allowed to use it to buy a pirate ship, and you're not allowed to use it to make yourself king. But you're accidentally kind of implicitly assuming you can build a gold statue of yourself. So you think you intrinsically value it, but actually you just value the statue.

I think that they really do change through reflection, and you kind of don't want to go all in on one while it's still in the midst of changing a lot. Plus, our brains are pretty noisy machines; maybe it's influenced by what you ate for breakfast, maybe you want to wait until tomorrow before making a huge life decision based on it.

So for example, you might really like cute kittens playing with yarn, but they're probably not an intrinsic value. You probably don't want to spread kittens playing with yarn over the whole universe, for example. So you might have an intrinsic value of the pleasure you get from watching a kitten play with yarn, you might have an intrinsic value related to the kitten enjoying playing with yarn. But you have to be careful to separate these very similar seeming psychological&nbsp;phenomena.</p><p>All right, so what the heck do people's intrinsic values actually look like? Well, you can categorize them into three&nbsp;groups.</p><ol><li>Those about the&nbsp;self;</li><li>Those about the community, which are basically individuals that are special to you in some way, like your friends or&nbsp;family;</li><li>Universal ones that don't relate to yourself or the&nbsp;community.</li></ol><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4ONSnwzjji0WUaqE40wE8S/fe324fd903d9b5308c5c9774fe0ab360/Intrinsic_Values_15.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4ONSnwzjji0WUaqE40wE8S/fe324fd903d9b5308c5c9774fe0ab360/Intrinsic_Values_15.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4ONSnwzjji0WUaqE40wE8S/fe324fd903d9b5308c5c9774fe0ab360/Intrinsic_Values_15.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4ONSnwzjji0WUaqE40wE8S/fe324fd903d9b5308c5c9774fe0ab360/Intrinsic_Values_15.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4ONSnwzjji0WUaqE40wE8S/fe324fd903d9b5308c5c9774fe0ab360/Intrinsic_Values_15.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4ONSnwzjji0WUaqE40wE8S/fe324fd903d9b5308c5c9774fe0ab360/Intrinsic_Values_15.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4ONSnwzjji0WUaqE40wE8S/fe324fd903d9b5308c5c9774fe0ab360/Intrinsic_Values_15.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Now I suspect that most people have all three types of intrinsic values. People are not just about their self usually - though there might be exceptions. They're not just about community usually either, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>Now the interesting thing about universal intrinsic values is they create a reason for strangers who've never met to cooperate, because they both really care about producing something in the world that has nothing to do with themselves, and nothing to do with people they know, even. So you could have strangers all around the world in a kind of global community all trying to support one value. That's pretty&nbsp;interesting.</p><p>I want to give you a few examples where this might be happening. One is classical utilitarians; they might have happiness and non-suffering as one or two of their intrinsic values. Or libertarians might have autonomy as one of their intrinsic values. And I want to dig into the autonomy one a little bit, because I think for some libertarians, probably really what it's about is the beneficial effects of autonomy. But I suspect that there are some libertarians where it's really an intrinsic value. So if you say, \"But why do you care about autonomy?\" That's like asking someone, \"Why do you care about your own pleasure?\" What is the answer to that question? If it's an intrinsic value, it's very hard to answer that. Because it's sort of like, it's not clear there's anything underneath&nbsp;that.</p><p>Or take social justice advocates. I think when they fight for equal treatment, obviously there are a lot of beneficial effects of equal treatment. But I suspect for some social justice advocates, they care about equal treatment intrinsically as well, not just for its positive effects, but they think it's good in and of&nbsp;itself.</p><h2>Experiments in search of intrinsic&nbsp;values</h2><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/b93i4WFdPqCYE6uikyCKo/b3bedca9d570fa5c7cb05a6c7899a138/Intrinsic_Values_16.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/b93i4WFdPqCYE6uikyCKo/b3bedca9d570fa5c7cb05a6c7899a138/Intrinsic_Values_16.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/b93i4WFdPqCYE6uikyCKo/b3bedca9d570fa5c7cb05a6c7899a138/Intrinsic_Values_16.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/b93i4WFdPqCYE6uikyCKo/b3bedca9d570fa5c7cb05a6c7899a138/Intrinsic_Values_16.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/b93i4WFdPqCYE6uikyCKo/b3bedca9d570fa5c7cb05a6c7899a138/Intrinsic_Values_16.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/b93i4WFdPqCYE6uikyCKo/b3bedca9d570fa5c7cb05a6c7899a138/Intrinsic_Values_16.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/b93i4WFdPqCYE6uikyCKo/b3bedca9d570fa5c7cb05a6c7899a138/Intrinsic_Values_16.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Now, I ran a study to learn about the frequency of 60 possible intrinsic values. This is a photograph of me that someone took while I was running the study. Why was I so sad? It's because it's really hard to measure people's intrinsic values. Really, really hard. So you have to take what I say here in my study results with a large grain of salt. I did work pretty hard to try to screen out people that didn't properly understand their intrinsic values. But still, you have to take this with a grain of&nbsp;salt.</p><p>So, in my US sample, here are a few of the intrinsic values related to self that people reported. 74% reported that \"I feel happy\" is an intrinsic value. 63% that \"others love me\". 62% that \"people trust&nbsp;me\".</p><p>On community intrinsic values, 69% of people reported that \"people I know feel happy\" is an intrinsic value. 50% that \"people I know suffer less\". And 44% that \"people I know get what they&nbsp;want\".</p><p>In terms of universal ones, 60% reported that \"humans are kind to each other\" is an intrinsic value. 57% that \"humans have freedom to pursue what they choose\". And 49% that \"people suffer&nbsp;less\".</p><p>Okay, but what intrinsic values do effective altruists have? I actually got a ton of effective altruists to fill out this survey, and I was able to analyze it using a regression to look at what intrinsic values are associated with being an effective altruist, controlling for your age, gender, and political affiliation. It turned out all of the effects I found were around increasing the happiness or pleasure, or reducing or decreasing the suffering of conscious beings. So maybe not a huge shock there, but somewhat validating for the technique, at&nbsp;least.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/605KX2la4okwW6QCK6uqyS/da917b089a1e4ed284b221eb48db753d/Intrinsic_Values_17.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/605KX2la4okwW6QCK6uqyS/da917b089a1e4ed284b221eb48db753d/Intrinsic_Values_17.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/605KX2la4okwW6QCK6uqyS/da917b089a1e4ed284b221eb48db753d/Intrinsic_Values_17.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/605KX2la4okwW6QCK6uqyS/da917b089a1e4ed284b221eb48db753d/Intrinsic_Values_17.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/605KX2la4okwW6QCK6uqyS/da917b089a1e4ed284b221eb48db753d/Intrinsic_Values_17.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/605KX2la4okwW6QCK6uqyS/da917b089a1e4ed284b221eb48db753d/Intrinsic_Values_17.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/605KX2la4okwW6QCK6uqyS/da917b089a1e4ed284b221eb48db753d/Intrinsic_Values_17.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>But perhaps a little bit more interestingly, most effective altruists actually reported some other intrinsic values as well.

So okay, so if you think world A is better than world B, raise your hand. If you think otherwise, put your hand on your shoulder. Interesting, all&nbsp;right.</p><p>My understanding of my own intrinsic values has evolved over the years. When I was young, I couldn't even speak. Eventually I started thinking about these things; I didn't know what my intrinsic values were. After reading some philosophy, I eventually started thinking that all of my universal intrinsic values that weren't related to myself or my community were about the happiness and non-suffering of all conscious beings - philosophy sometimes does this to people. But as I thought about it more and more and really started to reflect, I think I was actually making a mistake. I think I was mis-modeling my own brain. And I think my universal intrinsic values are actually significantly more complicated than that. I think a very large chunk of them has to do with the happiness and non-suffering of conscious beings. But I think I have other chunks to that value system that involve people believing true things, not doing tons of harm on the way to trying to help people and things like&nbsp;that.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/292xkfGksgge40EUk2IAmC/6ff2470f61bb20a6df75fb2a8c6adf75/Intrinsic_Values_22.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/292xkfGksgge40EUk2IAmC/6ff2470f61bb20a6df75fb2a8c6adf75/Intrinsic_Values_22.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/292xkfGksgge40EUk2IAmC/6ff2470f61bb20a6df75fb2a8c6adf75/Intrinsic_Values_22.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/292xkfGksgge40EUk2IAmC/6ff2470f61bb20a6df75fb2a8c6adf75/Intrinsic_Values_22.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/292xkfGksgge40EUk2IAmC/6ff2470f61bb20a6df75fb2a8c6adf75/Intrinsic_Values_22.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/292xkfGksgge40EUk2IAmC/6ff2470f61bb20a6df75fb2a8c6adf75/Intrinsic_Values_22.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/292xkfGksgge40EUk2IAmC/6ff2470f61bb20a6df75fb2a8c6adf75/Intrinsic_Values_22.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>My personal mission is actually sort of a direct application of my intrinsic values, in a sense. I founded this company Spark Wave: What we do is we create novel software companies from scratch, to try to make the world better. We go out and we build a first version of each product, and we'll go and recruit a CEO to actually try to work on running that product and put it out there in the&nbsp;world.</p><p>Just to give you an idea of some of the things we work on, two of our products are very much focused around reducing suffering, so UpLift is trying to help people with depression feel less depressed. And Mind Ease is trying to take people who have really bad anxiety and make that anxiety significantly better when they need&nbsp;it.</p><p>Two of our other products are really focused around accelerating the search for the truth. One is Clearer Thinking, which is at clearerthinking.org if you want to check it out. We have about 20 free tools that help you think about your life, try to make better decisions, try to reduce your bias and so on. And Positly, which is a new platform we built for helping people run research studies to try to accelerate the pace of social&nbsp;science.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5HUMn2M1byECYYQSEsCIu0/681988a45b433a69b9870e170470f2f4/Intrinsic_Values_23.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5HUMn2M1byECYYQSEsCIu0/681988a45b433a69b9870e170470f2f4/Intrinsic_Values_23.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5HUMn2M1byECYYQSEsCIu0/681988a45b433a69b9870e170470f2f4/Intrinsic_Values_23.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5HUMn2M1byECYYQSEsCIu0/681988a45b433a69b9870e170470f2f4/Intrinsic_Values_23.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5HUMn2M1byECYYQSEsCIu0/681988a45b433a69b9870e170470f2f4/Intrinsic_Values_23.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5HUMn2M1byECYYQSEsCIu0/681988a45b433a69b9870e170470f2f4/Intrinsic_Values_23.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5HUMn2M1byECYYQSEsCIu0/681988a45b433a69b9870e170470f2f4/Intrinsic_Values_23.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>So I'd like to leave you with all this, with just three ideas. One, you probably have multiple intrinsic values. Two, you might not yet know what they all are. And three, that it's really worth spending some time to explore&nbsp;them.</p><p>Thank you so&nbsp;much.</p><p>And if you're interested in my work, feel free to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/spencer.greenberg\">check it out on Facebook</a>.</p><h2>Q&amp;A</h2><p><strong>Question:</strong> I noticed in the last couple of talks I've seen you give, you've cited studies done on Mechanical Turk, which I imagine gives you the lowest research budget of maybe anyone ever. You pay like 10 cents, or a dollar, to each respondent. Maybe you could give us a little peek into your method of using Mechanical Turk, and how generalizable you think that might be for investigating things like&nbsp;that.</p><p><strong>Spencer:</strong> Yeah, that's a great question. So for example, in this study it was a combination of Mechanical Turk and people on Facebook. I got my EAs from Facebook, because there aren't too many of them on Mechanical&nbsp;Turk.</p><p>With Positly, which is one of our products I mentioned, our goal is to make it really easy to recruit people really rapidly for studies. Ultimately, our goal is that you're going to be able to plug into all different diverse populations, through one really easy to use platform. That's where we're&nbsp;moving.</p><p>But right now, Mechanical Turk is one of the fastest, easiest, least expensive ways to get a sample. And one of the interesting things about the Mechanical Turk population is it actually matches the effective altruists in a bunch of variables. I've investigated this closely. On age distribution it's actually closer to the EAs than the US population, in liberal-ness, And a few other ways as well. So I think it's certainly not a perfect population, but it actually is kind of a better control group than you'd think for EAs. And also, our plans are to try to make that kind of research really, really cheap, but also getting really high quality representative samples and things like that. Ultimately that's where we want to&nbsp;move.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> When you think about intrinsic values, the word intrinsic obviously suggests some sort of fundamental nature. But I find myself kind of not sure if I think they're sort of embedded in my brain and the result of natural selection over obviously a long time, or if they more cultural. So I'm kind of torn as to where do I think these things really come from, even in&nbsp;myself.</p><p><strong>Spencer:</strong> Yeah, it's a good question, and it's really hard to answer. So what I'm talking about is a psychological phenomenon where you notice how we value some things, and we don't value other things. What is that? It's difficult to talk about. I do think it's influenced by all of the above. I think it's probably evolutionarily influenced, I think also partly culturally. I think they can change; I think mine have changed to some extent as I've reflected on them. And I think certain thought experiments actually can make them change in a way where you resolve inconsistencies and kind of find bugs in your value&nbsp;system.</p><p>For example, I think a lot of people have this value like: \"suffering is really bad\", but they never really considered the scope, and the question: \"Is 1,000 people suffering just twice as bad as one person suffering?\" Or maybe it's a lot more than that. So you can kind of do these thought experiments, and you start to realize, \"oh maybe I had some inconsistency of that value\", and can kind of flesh it out. So it's a really complicated question. Yeah, I wish I had better answers. But this is the best shot I've got at it so&nbsp;far.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> It feels like you're sort of describing a trajectory where we start with very complicated messy values, and refine them to a point. But also you sort of sound a note of caution that you don't want refine them down to too few, because then you sort of miss the point as&nbsp;well.</p><p><strong>Spencer:</strong> Well you don't want do it mistakenly. Like in that I think a lot of people jump the gun, and they think oh, I figured out the one true value, therefore that's my values. And actually they're describing two things. They're describing their explicit belief about what values are, and then this other thing, which is what their internal value system actually does. They gloss over that distinction. I think that's&nbsp;unhealthy.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> How do we avoid collapsing all of our values into the feeling of having values satisfied? Like there's this sort of sense of okay, I got what I want, which you can get from a lot of different things. But that - maybe it is - but it seems like we don't really want that to be our base&nbsp;value.</p><p><strong>Spencer:</strong> Well, that's a good question. I think that humans have some values that are very satisfiable values. And others that just sort of are insatiable, right? Like if you have this value that there shouldn't be suffering in the world, well good luck satisfying that, right? Hopefully you're trying, but it's going to be a while. So, I'm not too worried about that, and then I think some of the values are more stable. And it's true, maybe you could try to suppress those values, and promote ones that you could easily satisfy, and maybe that's not&nbsp;great.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> What advice do you have for people who are trying to balance or prioritize between multiple conflicting values that they do feel to be&nbsp;intrinsic?</p><p><strong>Spencer:</strong> That's a good question. And I think that sometimes some of the hardest decisions in our lives are when we actually have multiple values coming into conflict. And I have some memories from my own life where that's happened. And you know, when I think actually this is perhaps the sixth reason why it's useful to think about your intrinsic values, is because you can be in this deep conflict, and not really recognize what's going on. And what's going on might be value A of yours is in direct conflict with value B, and you're being put to the test on how you balance those two things. It's really hard. So I don't have a nice answer of how you do that, other than to really reflect on those two values and say: How much of this am I willing to give up for how much of&nbsp;that?</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> What's a moment or story from your own life where you have been forced to question and update your intrinsic&nbsp;values?</p><p><strong>Spencer:</strong> Yeah, so I think when I was younger I was like - because I kind of thought of myself as a utilitarian - I was kind of convinced the only thing that's really important in a universal sense is utility. And I kind of thought that was the way my brain worked for a little while. I think I was confused about that. Then I think I would've been more okay with certain things where you're like oh, we're going do this thing, and it's not going be great for the world, but then later it will eventually make up for it. And I think now I'm much less willing to consider things like that, because basically I think I actually have a fundamental value towards not causing substantial amounts of&nbsp;harm.</p><p>I think people in the EA community, they sometimes think about veganism as a utilitarian thing, for example. But there are other ways to frame utilitarianism. Like as in: don't just constantly cause tons of harm, right? And that's sort of a different value that maybe supports that lifestyle choice. So you know, there's different ways to look at a lot of these&nbsp;things.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> Do you have a finite list that are your working set of intrinsic values that you go&nbsp;around?</p><p><strong>Spencer:</strong> I feel like I'm still working on it. I think our minds are so messy and complicated that this is a process you go through. And I think I have a much better understanding than I used to, but I don't think I have a complete understanding of my own mind in this&nbsp;way.</p>", "user": {"username": "The Centre for Effective Altruism"}}, {"_id": "sDRhddmEJYczdWEEg", "title": "Bruce Friedrich: From agitator to innovator", "postedAt": "2018-06-08T07:15:28.859Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AULCDAFo6AY&amp;list=PLwp9xeoX5p8P3cDQwlyN7qsFhC9Ms4L5W&amp;index=7\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/AULCDAFo6AY\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><hr><p><i>By following his ethical principles and paying attention to what worked, Bruce Friedrich went from volunteering at a soup kitchen to being the Executive Director of the Good Food Institute.

I grew up in Oklahoma and among my friends in high school, McDonald's Big Macs and Dairy Queen Blizzards were pretty much a religion. If the faith had a holy trinity, the Big Macs and Blizzards would be joined by pretty much bacon-anything. Then in 1987, I met this guy who blew my mind. He told me he didn't eat meat. Didn't eat meat? I thought maybe he had a disease. The idea of voluntarily not eating meat absolutely did not register, and quite honestly it seemed more than a little freakish. Flash forward 30 years, and I now run an organization that ACE has said is one of the top three charities for basically helping animals, by moving people away from eating the products of industrial animal agriculture.</p><p>I was asked to share my story as a case study in trying to do the most good. I'll explain how I came to work on ending factory farming, a few of the mistakes that I made along the way and why I think food technology is one of the most effective ways of removing animals from the equation and thereby helping animals not to&nbsp;suffer.</p><p>Let's start with how I decided to make it my mission to end factory farming. The year is 1987. I've just arrived in college and I have nothing but time for the really big questions in life. So Socrates' adage, \"the unexamined life is not worth living\", spoke to me. It's a powerful concept and really most philosophy of the last 2,500 years has basically been a variation on that theme. What does it look like to lead an examined life? So I arrive at campus at Cornell College in Iowa, and I join an organization called Poverty Action Now. At Poverty Action Now, we organize fasts to raise money for Oxfam International and we volunteer our weekends at a soup kitchen in the big city: Des&nbsp;Moines.</p><p>The main organizer of the soup kitchen trips gave me a book called Diet for a Small Planet by Frances Moore Lapp\u00e9. The book clocks in at about 500 pages, but the cliff notes version is: Farm animals have to eat, and they are extraordinarily inefficient at turning the crops that we feed to them into meat. And this just makes intuitive sense. I weigh about 185 pounds. If I do nothing but lie in bed watching reruns of the Jerry Springer show, I'm going to burn like 2,400 calories a day. Except when something awesome is happening on screen, I'm like \"Jerry! Jerry!\", you know? Then my caloric intake ticks up just a little bit. And that same sort of relationship is true for farm animals. Not that they had to have the bad taste or the good, good taste to watch Jerry Springer, but that the vast majority of what you feed to a chicken or a pig or a cow or a farmed fish, they expend simply&nbsp;existing.</p><p>So Gandhi said probably 20 of the most powerful things that were ever said. One of the things that Gandhi said that had a really powerful impact on me was this: \"Think of the face of the poorest person you have ever seen, and ask yourself if the action you contemplate will be of use to that person.\" For me, the idea of cycling massive amounts of crops through animals\u2026 well, at that point there were 40 million people dying every single year from starvation related causes. There were hundreds of millions of people living in nutritional deficit. It just absolutely did not register, and I went vegan immediately after reading that book. When I got out of college, I was so taken with the soup kitchen work that I moved to Washington DC and I joined a Catholic worker soup kitchen, the largest homeless shelter and soup kitchen in Washington DC. So basically Matthew 25, I was feeding the hungry, housing the homeless, like Jesus told us to. It was also decided I wanted to look like&nbsp;Jesus.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6mqi78UmD6iuIKUiO44moC/0d134096ae2c9d7dde341b1e6ce0125f/EAGx_S.F__04-18__1_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6mqi78UmD6iuIKUiO44moC/0d134096ae2c9d7dde341b1e6ce0125f/EAGx_S.F__04-18__1_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6mqi78UmD6iuIKUiO44moC/0d134096ae2c9d7dde341b1e6ce0125f/EAGx_S.F__04-18__1_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6mqi78UmD6iuIKUiO44moC/0d134096ae2c9d7dde341b1e6ce0125f/EAGx_S.F__04-18__1_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6mqi78UmD6iuIKUiO44moC/0d134096ae2c9d7dde341b1e6ce0125f/EAGx_S.F__04-18__1_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6mqi78UmD6iuIKUiO44moC/0d134096ae2c9d7dde341b1e6ce0125f/EAGx_S.F__04-18__1_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6mqi78UmD6iuIKUiO44moC/0d134096ae2c9d7dde341b1e6ce0125f/EAGx_S.F__04-18__1_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Handsome devil. At the homeless shelter, one of the other people in the shelter gave me a book called Christianity and the Rights of Animals by an Anglican Priest and professor of theology at Oxford University. And the book puts its arguments into a faith context, but it's really just about the nature of the human relationship with other animals, this sort of eternal concept that is applicable to people of every religion or no religion or whatever. And the information that Linzey covered about factory farming just totally blew me away. I literally couldn't believe what was happening on modern farms and what was happening in modern slaughterhouses. And after a couple years of conversations with people and prayer and discussion with my spiritual adviser, in 1996, I decided to shift my vocation from running a homeless shelter and running a soup kitchen, and I went to work full time on behalf of animals, at People for the Ethical Treatment of&nbsp;Animals.</p><p>You know, people in EA, we get a fair amount of crap for putting philanthropy up to the tender mercies of cost/benefit analysis. But even as a caricature, I think that's not particularly fair. I think a lot of people follow paths that were similar to mine, where there isn't actually that much difference between following our heads and following our hearts. I found the arguments against factory farming compelling: the harm to the environment, the harm to the global poor, the harm to animals, but I probably wouldn't have gotten involved if the arguments were not also compelling to me on an emotional level and a spiritual level. So you could either say that I was maximizing the expected utility of my marginal efforts relative to the counterfactual, or you could say I was honoring my duty as a Catholic to care for the least of these that Jesus talks about in Matthew 25. Either way, you'd be&nbsp;right.</p><h2>What to do about&nbsp;it?</h2><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5ECFxczstyQwASUSigYYSy/7ff6bb0b416a604fba1c62becc68ca24/EAGx_S.F__04-18__2_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5ECFxczstyQwASUSigYYSy/7ff6bb0b416a604fba1c62becc68ca24/EAGx_S.F__04-18__2_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5ECFxczstyQwASUSigYYSy/7ff6bb0b416a604fba1c62becc68ca24/EAGx_S.F__04-18__2_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5ECFxczstyQwASUSigYYSy/7ff6bb0b416a604fba1c62becc68ca24/EAGx_S.F__04-18__2_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5ECFxczstyQwASUSigYYSy/7ff6bb0b416a604fba1c62becc68ca24/EAGx_S.F__04-18__2_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5ECFxczstyQwASUSigYYSy/7ff6bb0b416a604fba1c62becc68ca24/EAGx_S.F__04-18__2_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5ECFxczstyQwASUSigYYSy/7ff6bb0b416a604fba1c62becc68ca24/EAGx_S.F__04-18__2_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>So after I decided what to work on next, I had to figure out how to achieve the change that I wanted to see. And I started by appealing to people's moral values. I figured it should be easy to convince people to stop eating animals because most people claim to care about the environment, they claim to care about the global poor, they claim to care about animals. Ninety-five percent of people, according to Gallup, want to see animals protected from abuse. But I quickly realized that simple moral arguments might not be enough. So I started piling on the facts. The more numbers and authorities, the better. So, here are my go-to facts:</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/12hZd4SHdsYEeA6UEEGaEe/4f507c5ec7cbd1f90ab657df9aa36ba0/EAGx_S.F__04-18__3_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/12hZd4SHdsYEeA6UEEGaEe/4f507c5ec7cbd1f90ab657df9aa36ba0/EAGx_S.F__04-18__3_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/12hZd4SHdsYEeA6UEEGaEe/4f507c5ec7cbd1f90ab657df9aa36ba0/EAGx_S.F__04-18__3_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/12hZd4SHdsYEeA6UEEGaEe/4f507c5ec7cbd1f90ab657df9aa36ba0/EAGx_S.F__04-18__3_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/12hZd4SHdsYEeA6UEEGaEe/4f507c5ec7cbd1f90ab657df9aa36ba0/EAGx_S.F__04-18__3_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/12hZd4SHdsYEeA6UEEGaEe/4f507c5ec7cbd1f90ab657df9aa36ba0/EAGx_S.F__04-18__3_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/12hZd4SHdsYEeA6UEEGaEe/4f507c5ec7cbd1f90ab657df9aa36ba0/EAGx_S.F__04-18__3_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>The first one is that meat is a huge contributor to climate change. So most people, when they think about climate change, they think about transportation. So the solution is either to drive less or to get a hybrid, but according to the United Nations, more climate change is attributable to animal agriculture than to all of the planes and trains and cars, and then to all forms of transportation&nbsp;combined.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4PIIls2tGEIOoog2EEYG4m/7c1f40b710b9d89cd8dbc57b0918e3a7/EAGx_S.F__04-18__4_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4PIIls2tGEIOoog2EEYG4m/7c1f40b710b9d89cd8dbc57b0918e3a7/EAGx_S.F__04-18__4_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4PIIls2tGEIOoog2EEYG4m/7c1f40b710b9d89cd8dbc57b0918e3a7/EAGx_S.F__04-18__4_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4PIIls2tGEIOoog2EEYG4m/7c1f40b710b9d89cd8dbc57b0918e3a7/EAGx_S.F__04-18__4_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4PIIls2tGEIOoog2EEYG4m/7c1f40b710b9d89cd8dbc57b0918e3a7/EAGx_S.F__04-18__4_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4PIIls2tGEIOoog2EEYG4m/7c1f40b710b9d89cd8dbc57b0918e3a7/EAGx_S.F__04-18__4_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4PIIls2tGEIOoog2EEYG4m/7c1f40b710b9d89cd8dbc57b0918e3a7/EAGx_S.F__04-18__4_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>On a per-calorie basis, the least climate change inducing meat is chicken. And yet chicken causes 40 times as much climate change on a per-protein-calorie basis when compared to legumes like soy and peas, the primary alternatives for people are shifting away from eating&nbsp;meat.</p><p>Fact two is the basic inefficiency. Most people in society are very concerned about food waste. They see food waste as a moral issue. So who here is concerned about food waste? Yeah, that's true in every audience. Every time I ask that question, every hand goes up. And we should be concerned about food waste. About 40 percent of all of the food that's produced in the West, about 40 percent of it is literally thrown&nbsp;away.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Nzx54WCcwyAGYsgWaoIgm/fe507799228f89bca8ba1c208ef8fed7/EAGx_S.F__04-18__5_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Nzx54WCcwyAGYsgWaoIgm/fe507799228f89bca8ba1c208ef8fed7/EAGx_S.F__04-18__5_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Nzx54WCcwyAGYsgWaoIgm/fe507799228f89bca8ba1c208ef8fed7/EAGx_S.F__04-18__5_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Nzx54WCcwyAGYsgWaoIgm/fe507799228f89bca8ba1c208ef8fed7/EAGx_S.F__04-18__5_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Nzx54WCcwyAGYsgWaoIgm/fe507799228f89bca8ba1c208ef8fed7/EAGx_S.F__04-18__5_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Nzx54WCcwyAGYsgWaoIgm/fe507799228f89bca8ba1c208ef8fed7/EAGx_S.F__04-18__5_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Nzx54WCcwyAGYsgWaoIgm/fe507799228f89bca8ba1c208ef8fed7/EAGx_S.F__04-18__5_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>And yet, if you're looking at this chart, what you're seeing is that the basic physiology of animals, the basic inefficiency of growing crops to feed them to animals so that we can eat animals, means that you're talking about 700 percent food waste for farmed fish. 800 percent food waste for chickens. 900 percent food waste for pigs. It takes eight calories into a farmed fish to get one calorie back out, nine calories into a chicken, ten calories into a pig to get one calorie back out. We're not personally throwing away all of those crops, but we may as well be. That's the relationship that we're entering&nbsp;into.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2DFBhlWtpY2GWAq02MGuas/99978bd27b775e7f589b05e6b57fbf44/EAGx_S.F__04-18__6_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2DFBhlWtpY2GWAq02MGuas/99978bd27b775e7f589b05e6b57fbf44/EAGx_S.F__04-18__6_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2DFBhlWtpY2GWAq02MGuas/99978bd27b775e7f589b05e6b57fbf44/EAGx_S.F__04-18__6_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2DFBhlWtpY2GWAq02MGuas/99978bd27b775e7f589b05e6b57fbf44/EAGx_S.F__04-18__6_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2DFBhlWtpY2GWAq02MGuas/99978bd27b775e7f589b05e6b57fbf44/EAGx_S.F__04-18__6_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2DFBhlWtpY2GWAq02MGuas/99978bd27b775e7f589b05e6b57fbf44/EAGx_S.F__04-18__6_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2DFBhlWtpY2GWAq02MGuas/99978bd27b775e7f589b05e6b57fbf44/EAGx_S.F__04-18__6_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Fact three: The world is threatened by the widespread use of antibiotics on these disease-ridden factory farms. According to a report from the UK government, antibiotic resistance is slated to cost to the global economy $100 trillion by 2050, and the threat to the human race from superbugs is greater than the threat from climate&nbsp;change.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1OZXvf04SQiaGacak4yA40/6d8172fd7cb43eb1fcab4dd92f04fec8/EAGx_S.F__04-18__7_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1OZXvf04SQiaGacak4yA40/6d8172fd7cb43eb1fcab4dd92f04fec8/EAGx_S.F__04-18__7_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1OZXvf04SQiaGacak4yA40/6d8172fd7cb43eb1fcab4dd92f04fec8/EAGx_S.F__04-18__7_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1OZXvf04SQiaGacak4yA40/6d8172fd7cb43eb1fcab4dd92f04fec8/EAGx_S.F__04-18__7_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1OZXvf04SQiaGacak4yA40/6d8172fd7cb43eb1fcab4dd92f04fec8/EAGx_S.F__04-18__7_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1OZXvf04SQiaGacak4yA40/6d8172fd7cb43eb1fcab4dd92f04fec8/EAGx_S.F__04-18__7_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1OZXvf04SQiaGacak4yA40/6d8172fd7cb43eb1fcab4dd92f04fec8/EAGx_S.F__04-18__7_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>And then finally fact four: Chickens' upper bodies now grow at 600 percent the rate that they would naturally. Poultry researchers at the University of Arkansas said that if a human baby grew as quickly as a modern broiler chicken, she would weigh more than 600 pounds by the time she was two months old. Imagine that. 600 pounds by the time she was two months old. The animals are living in unmitigated misery, all of them for their entire lives. So those are the&nbsp;facts.</p><p>And shockingly, hurling facts at people didn't convince everybody to immediately go vegan. Honestly, when I adopted a vegan diet in 1987, and I read Diet for a Small Planet, I just thought, I just need to tell everybody this and everybody is going to go vegan of course. Then I went to work at PETA in 1996 and I thought everybody loves animals. All we really have to do - we don't have to win an argument with a meat eater - all we have to do is show people what's happening and obviously people will want to align their values and their actions. Everybody's going to go vegan. We just need to tell them, and again, it didn't&nbsp;happen.</p><p>What I've come to understand is that the vast majority of people are not going to radically change their diet on the basis of really anything other than price, taste and convenience. Maybe health. There appears to be something in human nature. I don't know if it's emotion or physiology or biology or psychology. I don't know what it is, but the vast majority of people just aren't that interested in changing their diet, and they're not interested in hearing from me about why they should change their diet. So the foremost think tank in Europe, it's called Chatham House, and a couple of years ago, Chatham House released a report. They said the governments of the world are not going to be able to meet their obligations under the Paris Climate Agreement unless they radically decrease the amount of meat that their populations are consuming. It's literally a scientific impossibility that we keep climate change under two degrees Celsius by 2050 unless meat consumption goes&nbsp;down.</p><p>And Chatham House's solution was that the governments of the world should educate their populations and convince people that they should eat less meat, in order to do their part in the battle against climate change. The Chinese government pledged to do just that in 2015 or 2016; the Chinese government said we're going to cut meat consumption in China per capita in half by 2030, as the Chinese response to climate change. And while I certainly am excited about and impressed by the optimism of Chatham House and the Chinese, I think most of us probably would have predicted what's happened in China since China made that pledge. Meat consumption is skyrocketing. As people get wealthier, they just eat more meat. At Good Food Institute, though, we think we have found a&nbsp;solution.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6vUtujmmTCIQ4K4qIga4UG/7fcf9be478b8e1dd66e51da3f477908d/EAGx_S.F__04-18__8_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6vUtujmmTCIQ4K4qIga4UG/7fcf9be478b8e1dd66e51da3f477908d/EAGx_S.F__04-18__8_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6vUtujmmTCIQ4K4qIga4UG/7fcf9be478b8e1dd66e51da3f477908d/EAGx_S.F__04-18__8_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6vUtujmmTCIQ4K4qIga4UG/7fcf9be478b8e1dd66e51da3f477908d/EAGx_S.F__04-18__8_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6vUtujmmTCIQ4K4qIga4UG/7fcf9be478b8e1dd66e51da3f477908d/EAGx_S.F__04-18__8_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6vUtujmmTCIQ4K4qIga4UG/7fcf9be478b8e1dd66e51da3f477908d/EAGx_S.F__04-18__8_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6vUtujmmTCIQ4K4qIga4UG/7fcf9be478b8e1dd66e51da3f477908d/EAGx_S.F__04-18__8_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Ben and Jerry's vegan ice cream. Who here likes Ben and Jerry's? Yeah, we've got unanimity for Ben and Jerry's, and everybody in this room when I said who likes Ben and Jerry's, you know, probably everybody just thought Ben and Jerry's is delicious. Right? That was the main thing that you thought. If it were too expensive, if it was like, you know, $10 or $15 a pint, probably a lot of you would have hesitated before you put your hands up. You don't want to spend that much money for ice cream. If you didn't know where to find it, if I put some plant-based ice cream from Europe up here or something, you'd be going, I'm not really sure what that is. And that reaction really does track what consumer researchers find. They find that the three factors that dictate consumer choice for literally 100 percent of people in the developed world: it's price, it's taste, it's&nbsp;convenience.</p><p>They also do weighting. So when they basically go for the things that are the top three for sort of everybody: price, taste and convenience are the only things that go above zero in terms of what dictates consumer choice. So some people do care about health, which is another talk all on its own, the degree to which people say they care about health and then buy unhealthy food. And I think we can see that in this room when I said, who here likes Ben and Jerry's? Everybody put up their hand, and nobody thought that's where they were going to get anything healthy. Nobody thought that Ben and Jerry's was a health food. So the question is how do we apply the Ben and Jerry's trifecta to the problem of industrial animal agriculture and the solution is we replicate meat from plants and we do clean meat, and I'm going to talk just a little bit about both those&nbsp;things.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1Zd14tHCy4wMUO20w6weu6/2e0607031caa77b8f527fb8e3a839d3a/EAGx_S.F__04-18__9_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1Zd14tHCy4wMUO20w6weu6/2e0607031caa77b8f527fb8e3a839d3a/EAGx_S.F__04-18__9_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1Zd14tHCy4wMUO20w6weu6/2e0607031caa77b8f527fb8e3a839d3a/EAGx_S.F__04-18__9_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1Zd14tHCy4wMUO20w6weu6/2e0607031caa77b8f527fb8e3a839d3a/EAGx_S.F__04-18__9_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1Zd14tHCy4wMUO20w6weu6/2e0607031caa77b8f527fb8e3a839d3a/EAGx_S.F__04-18__9_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1Zd14tHCy4wMUO20w6weu6/2e0607031caa77b8f527fb8e3a839d3a/EAGx_S.F__04-18__9_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1Zd14tHCy4wMUO20w6weu6/2e0607031caa77b8f527fb8e3a839d3a/EAGx_S.F__04-18__9_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p><i>This is plant-based sausage.</i></p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6PPkX8fLLUOmCOUqQsKKs0/81118fe7c337947280e5d18530c63143/EAGx_S.F__04-18__10_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6PPkX8fLLUOmCOUqQsKKs0/81118fe7c337947280e5d18530c63143/EAGx_S.F__04-18__10_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6PPkX8fLLUOmCOUqQsKKs0/81118fe7c337947280e5d18530c63143/EAGx_S.F__04-18__10_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6PPkX8fLLUOmCOUqQsKKs0/81118fe7c337947280e5d18530c63143/EAGx_S.F__04-18__10_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6PPkX8fLLUOmCOUqQsKKs0/81118fe7c337947280e5d18530c63143/EAGx_S.F__04-18__10_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6PPkX8fLLUOmCOUqQsKKs0/81118fe7c337947280e5d18530c63143/EAGx_S.F__04-18__10_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6PPkX8fLLUOmCOUqQsKKs0/81118fe7c337947280e5d18530c63143/EAGx_S.F__04-18__10_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p><i>This is plant based chicken.</i></p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Pgm02B5ryOG4mq4yEyEsw/1902e13c5bf819c8b96bbf5efb07dd27/EAGx_S.F__04-18__11_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Pgm02B5ryOG4mq4yEyEsw/1902e13c5bf819c8b96bbf5efb07dd27/EAGx_S.F__04-18__11_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Pgm02B5ryOG4mq4yEyEsw/1902e13c5bf819c8b96bbf5efb07dd27/EAGx_S.F__04-18__11_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Pgm02B5ryOG4mq4yEyEsw/1902e13c5bf819c8b96bbf5efb07dd27/EAGx_S.F__04-18__11_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Pgm02B5ryOG4mq4yEyEsw/1902e13c5bf819c8b96bbf5efb07dd27/EAGx_S.F__04-18__11_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Pgm02B5ryOG4mq4yEyEsw/1902e13c5bf819c8b96bbf5efb07dd27/EAGx_S.F__04-18__11_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2Pgm02B5ryOG4mq4yEyEsw/1902e13c5bf819c8b96bbf5efb07dd27/EAGx_S.F__04-18__11_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p><i>This is a plant-based burger.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>This is a Beyond Burger from TGI Friday's. Bill Gates wrote a blog about plant-based meat. He called it the future of food. So after he had this, Beyond Meat's plant-based chicken, Bill Gates tried it and he said what I just tasted was not just a clever meat substitute, what I just tasted was the future of food and he wrote a blog post called the future of food. He said that plant-based meat was the future of food because of the capacity of plant-based meat to bio-mimic meat, but without all of the harms. So all of us, everybody who likes meat just continues to eat products that are delicious, that are convenient, that are affordable, the exact same factors that we have been using to figure out what we're going to eat up until now - we just keep doing that. But the nature of the meat becomes better.</p><h2>What Bruce is doing&nbsp;now</h2><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5pSdrzsLhm2wkE8MIgocq0/31fc499ab127791c5ff913e4c894fb8d/EAGx_S.F__04-18__12_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5pSdrzsLhm2wkE8MIgocq0/31fc499ab127791c5ff913e4c894fb8d/EAGx_S.F__04-18__12_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5pSdrzsLhm2wkE8MIgocq0/31fc499ab127791c5ff913e4c894fb8d/EAGx_S.F__04-18__12_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5pSdrzsLhm2wkE8MIgocq0/31fc499ab127791c5ff913e4c894fb8d/EAGx_S.F__04-18__12_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5pSdrzsLhm2wkE8MIgocq0/31fc499ab127791c5ff913e4c894fb8d/EAGx_S.F__04-18__12_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5pSdrzsLhm2wkE8MIgocq0/31fc499ab127791c5ff913e4c894fb8d/EAGx_S.F__04-18__12_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5pSdrzsLhm2wkE8MIgocq0/31fc499ab127791c5ff913e4c894fb8d/EAGx_S.F__04-18__12_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>I'm convinced that changing the way that we make meat is the solution to factory farming. But to be fair, I imagine some people are thinking yeah, well you were wrong every other time. Why are you convinced now? And it's true, I was both convinced and wrong previously as well. And the first thing is that it's been done before. So, plant based milk: think about soy milk and almond milk. When I adopted a vegan diet in 1987, soy milk and almond milk, they were not in any grocery stores. They were not in any coffee shops. If you did track down a dusty carton of the stuff in the nether regions of the dirty health food store, the stuff generally tasted pretty bad, and it was expensive.</p><p>And now, plant based milk, a lot of people like it more, it actually costs more and yet it's gotten up to 10 percent of the milk market. We do 10 percent with plant-based meat, that's 10 percent less of the climate change, 10 percent less of the inefficiency. It's more than a billion animals just in the United States who are taken out of industrial animal farming. But Bill Gates didn't call plant-based meat the future of food because he thinks we're going to get to 10 percent. He called it the future of food because it is so much more efficient. It will be able to taste the same and cost less, so it will be 50, 60, 70 percent. But for people who simply want to eat real meat, for people who are not going to eat plant-based meat\u2026 and I will tell you, even at someplace like Harvard Medical School, I'm talking to somebody who's going to be working on clean meat at Harvard Medical School, and he's like, yeah, I'm not gonna eat that. There are a surprising number of people who just want to eat real meat and for those, for the people who want to eat real meat, we have clean&nbsp;meat.</p><p>I hope a lot of you went to Natalie and Marie's session about clean meat. If not, watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k38qJcXJqPs\">the video</a>. It's fascinating. But clean meat is basically just real meat grown directly from cells. It's called clean meat mostly as a nod to clean energy, which is energy that's better for the environment. Clean meat is meat that's better for the environment. It's also just cleaner. It doesn't have the same bacterial contamination. It doesn't have the heavy metals. If it's clean meat fish, it doesn't have the mercury, and so&nbsp;on.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1ra1Bo5mYQok2OKIwMMqwU/2462345ed4609b2eef57ecd9b30a3e7f/EAGx_S.F__04-18__13_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1ra1Bo5mYQok2OKIwMMqwU/2462345ed4609b2eef57ecd9b30a3e7f/EAGx_S.F__04-18__13_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1ra1Bo5mYQok2OKIwMMqwU/2462345ed4609b2eef57ecd9b30a3e7f/EAGx_S.F__04-18__13_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1ra1Bo5mYQok2OKIwMMqwU/2462345ed4609b2eef57ecd9b30a3e7f/EAGx_S.F__04-18__13_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1ra1Bo5mYQok2OKIwMMqwU/2462345ed4609b2eef57ecd9b30a3e7f/EAGx_S.F__04-18__13_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1ra1Bo5mYQok2OKIwMMqwU/2462345ed4609b2eef57ecd9b30a3e7f/EAGx_S.F__04-18__13_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1ra1Bo5mYQok2OKIwMMqwU/2462345ed4609b2eef57ecd9b30a3e7f/EAGx_S.F__04-18__13_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p><i>This is a clean meat meatball.</i></p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1RsUnD0YcYa6WmMeqecYoi/3deb6e706aa4ccb266f21fe36d704c9f/EAGx_S.F__04-18__14_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1RsUnD0YcYa6WmMeqecYoi/3deb6e706aa4ccb266f21fe36d704c9f/EAGx_S.F__04-18__14_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1RsUnD0YcYa6WmMeqecYoi/3deb6e706aa4ccb266f21fe36d704c9f/EAGx_S.F__04-18__14_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1RsUnD0YcYa6WmMeqecYoi/3deb6e706aa4ccb266f21fe36d704c9f/EAGx_S.F__04-18__14_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1RsUnD0YcYa6WmMeqecYoi/3deb6e706aa4ccb266f21fe36d704c9f/EAGx_S.F__04-18__14_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1RsUnD0YcYa6WmMeqecYoi/3deb6e706aa4ccb266f21fe36d704c9f/EAGx_S.F__04-18__14_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1RsUnD0YcYa6WmMeqecYoi/3deb6e706aa4ccb266f21fe36d704c9f/EAGx_S.F__04-18__14_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p><i>Here is some clean meat duck.</i></p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3YrZMR0iVq4us4GKmmSUcw/baf21bede11d857dbae30ed1097c15cf/EAGx_S.F__04-18__15_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3YrZMR0iVq4us4GKmmSUcw/baf21bede11d857dbae30ed1097c15cf/EAGx_S.F__04-18__15_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3YrZMR0iVq4us4GKmmSUcw/baf21bede11d857dbae30ed1097c15cf/EAGx_S.F__04-18__15_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3YrZMR0iVq4us4GKmmSUcw/baf21bede11d857dbae30ed1097c15cf/EAGx_S.F__04-18__15_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3YrZMR0iVq4us4GKmmSUcw/baf21bede11d857dbae30ed1097c15cf/EAGx_S.F__04-18__15_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3YrZMR0iVq4us4GKmmSUcw/baf21bede11d857dbae30ed1097c15cf/EAGx_S.F__04-18__15_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3YrZMR0iVq4us4GKmmSUcw/baf21bede11d857dbae30ed1097c15cf/EAGx_S.F__04-18__15_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p><i>And this is what clean meat will look like at scale.</i></p><p>It's basically your friendly neighborhood meat brewery. That's where meat is going to come from and I'll spare you the photos of the industrial farm and the industrial slaughterhouse. But suffice it to say the clean meat brewery is a lot nicer to look&nbsp;at.</p><p>That brings me to my third reason for optimism and that is that big money agrees. People whose job is to figure out what the next big tech thing is going to be, they're all in with plant-based meat and clean meat. So, it's not going to surprise you to learn that people like Sergey Brin and Bill Gates and Richard Branson, they are investing in and singing the song of the promise of these technologies. Also Google Ventures, DFJ, Kleiner Perkins, a lot of the top venture capital funds in Silicon&nbsp;Valley.</p><p>What's more surprising is the degree to which the meat industry agrees. So Tyson Foods, which is by far the largest meat producer in the United States, they launched Tyson New Ventures about two years ago, which is their venture capital fund. Three of their first four investments were related to plant-based or clean meat. Their first investment was Beyond Meat, the plant based meat that got Bill Gates so excited. Their third investment was Memphis Meats, the first of the clean meat companies. And their fourth investment was an Israeli clean meat company called Future Meat Technologies. Not just Tyson, but Cargill has invested in Memphis Meats. They're the third largest of the meat producers in the United States.

For us, we want to be where the consumer is.\" Pretty much all of the corporate executives who GFI talks with, all of the foundations, all of the government, policymakers and regulators, people are excited about the fact that plant based meat and clean meat are so much more efficient, which means that as they scale up, they will taste the same and they will cost&nbsp;less.</p><p>But folks are also really, really excited about the capacity of plant-based meat and clean meat to solve some of the really big global problems. So Eric Schmidt, who is the former CEO at Google, a couple of years ago, he was at the Milken Global Summit and he was asked to reflect on half a dozen tech innovations that he thinks will improve life for humanity by a factor of at least tenfold in the fairly near future. And this is Eric Schmidt, so he's a tech guy. So he talked about mostly things you would expect. He talked about 3D printers for infrastructure. He talked about watches that know you're sick before you know you're&nbsp;sick.</p><p>But the first thing Eric talked about, he talked about plant-based meat. And the reason Eric is so excited about plant-based meat is that it solves two of humanity's biggest questions. The first is how do we feed 9.7 billion people by 2050? And the second is, what do we do about climate change? He called it nerds over cattle. Richard Branson is also super excited. He predicted in 30 years all meat will be either plant-based meat or clean&nbsp;meat.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1AL2xY8syMWkMyaCwUUg4c/7005a435432a88ce3a507f06358a7b16/EAGx_S.F__04-18__17_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1AL2xY8syMWkMyaCwUUg4c/7005a435432a88ce3a507f06358a7b16/EAGx_S.F__04-18__17_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1AL2xY8syMWkMyaCwUUg4c/7005a435432a88ce3a507f06358a7b16/EAGx_S.F__04-18__17_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1AL2xY8syMWkMyaCwUUg4c/7005a435432a88ce3a507f06358a7b16/EAGx_S.F__04-18__17_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1AL2xY8syMWkMyaCwUUg4c/7005a435432a88ce3a507f06358a7b16/EAGx_S.F__04-18__17_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1AL2xY8syMWkMyaCwUUg4c/7005a435432a88ce3a507f06358a7b16/EAGx_S.F__04-18__17_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1AL2xY8syMWkMyaCwUUg4c/7005a435432a88ce3a507f06358a7b16/EAGx_S.F__04-18__17_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>It shouldn't just be the venture capitalists though.

My basic advice, the three main pieces of advice are one, if you can go into science, please go into science. One of the really big obstacles at this point, is the tissue engineers and the synthetic biologists and biochemists to actually people these companies. If you're going the business route, look for experience that will make you invaluable. Simply applying to do a job that somebody else is going to do is probably not the best use of your talents. Go into food. I was talking to somebody yesterday who majored in Chinese Studies. He's fluent in Mandarin, and he's thinking about going to China and actually getting a job in the food industry in China. I mean, that is a job that if he doesn't do it, somebody with his sensibilities isn't going to do it. Absolutely invaluable.</p><p>And if you decide to make the world a better place in some other way, four other take homes that apply just across&nbsp;EA:</p><p>The first one is you don't have to choose between your head and your heart. Diving deeply into critical research is part and parcel of profoundly caring about the world and its&nbsp;inhabitants.</p><p>The second is, accept that we might not make the right choice the first time. If you're doing something and it's not working, don't be afraid to admit you're wrong and try something&nbsp;else.</p><p>The third is keep an eye out for unconventional partners. Hardcore vegan, soup kitchen running, Jesus bearded me would have never guessed that, twenty years later, I'd be friends with people from Tyson and Cargill, and working with them to make the world a better&nbsp;place.</p><p>And then finally look for win/win. If you can figure out a solution to a problem that doesn't require a radical change in how people view the world, that's going to help. So for me, I thought my goal was to convince everybody to see the world the way that I did. It turned out it's a lot easier to change the world than to change people's&nbsp;ideology.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6jriKtRM5Oo8EQo8WeSu6I/4716b2a6d03b37e3ed1e99c4903c31d8/EAGx_S.F__04-18__19_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6jriKtRM5Oo8EQo8WeSu6I/4716b2a6d03b37e3ed1e99c4903c31d8/EAGx_S.F__04-18__19_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6jriKtRM5Oo8EQo8WeSu6I/4716b2a6d03b37e3ed1e99c4903c31d8/EAGx_S.F__04-18__19_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6jriKtRM5Oo8EQo8WeSu6I/4716b2a6d03b37e3ed1e99c4903c31d8/EAGx_S.F__04-18__19_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6jriKtRM5Oo8EQo8WeSu6I/4716b2a6d03b37e3ed1e99c4903c31d8/EAGx_S.F__04-18__19_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6jriKtRM5Oo8EQo8WeSu6I/4716b2a6d03b37e3ed1e99c4903c31d8/EAGx_S.F__04-18__19_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6jriKtRM5Oo8EQo8WeSu6I/4716b2a6d03b37e3ed1e99c4903c31d8/EAGx_S.F__04-18__19_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>So just like freezer-made ice has replaced natural ice from lakes, and cars have replaced horses and buggies as our primary means of travel, I'm convinced that plant-based and clean meat can and will replace the products of industrial animal agriculture. That's why I went from agitator to innovator, and that's my case study in EA career&nbsp;choice.</p><h1>Q&amp;A</h1><p><strong>Question:</strong> You mentioned that a significant proportion of people won't eat plant-based meat because they want real meat. What makes you think that they'd be happy with clean meat? Because it has associations with weird technology, GMOs, chemicals, that sort of&nbsp;thing.</p><p><strong>Bruce:</strong> Yeah. This has been fascinating. So, especially when GFI first started and I was one of two employees - I was the only employee who was sort of the face of GFI, I went around and I spoke at Harvard and Stanford and MIT and all of these schools. I would introduce people to plant-based meat and clean meat. And at the end they were thoroughly primed, right? And I would say who here, if plant-based meat costs less than industrial animal meat and tasted exactly the same, who will switch over all of your meat eating. And they were super primed. So the numbers were pretty good. And I know that's probably, you know, may or may not be true. But the thing that I found again and again and again was that literally 100 percent of people raised their hand for clean meat. Whereas it was usually somewhere on the order of like 50 to 70 percent for plant based meat. And this has been replicated in conversation after conversation after conversation. People right now, they eat meat despite how it's produced. They don't eat meat because of how it's produced. So when you have meat produced in industrial animal agriculture, which 100 percent of people are opposed to, and they eat it anyway, or you talk about how clean meat is produced. I mean, I think everybody, everybody switches, especially when the price points reach&nbsp;equivalency.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> Someone asked what kind of potential or progress you see in the food service industry, like supplying prisons, hospitals and schools for plant-based entrepreneurs. Is it possible to provide plant-based meal services at price parity in this&nbsp;market?</p><p><strong>Bruce:</strong> Not yet, for plant-based meat. Yes, beans and rice are less expensive than meat. And USDA provides, you know, beans and rice, and likely provides meat for free to prisons. So you can get to price parity. I mean, I guess one thing for all of the questions, so the Good Food Institute exists to basically help the world make this transition. Anybody who in this room who was interested in exploring going in the direction of plant-based meat and clean meat, like if you have a question like this, there are multiple people at GFI whose job it is to work with you. So reach out to us if you want to get involved. If you want to explore your career choice, if you want to brainstorm what might be the best use of your time, it is literally GFI's role. It's our mission to take that call and be sort of at your disposal for these sorts of conversations. So don't look at it as an imposition. We want you to call us. We want you to email, and we will be thrilled to brainstorm what your path should be and how you can open markets into schools and prisons. We actually do have a whitepaper on the schools issue, and how plant-based entrepreneurs can get into schools. And we're working on similar&nbsp;whitepapers.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> How might you convince other EAs to join your cause over other things they might be&nbsp;prioritizing?</p><p><strong>Bruce:</strong> Yeah, I mean, I think EA does a pretty good job of sort of figuring out what the metric should be. I mean, obviously is it important, is it neglected, is tractable and I think the cause areas that Open Philanthropy and the Centre for Effective Altruism have landed on are\u2026 they resonate with me as the right cause areas. So I'm not super excited about the idea of trying to convince somebody that, you know, if they've picked one of those cause areas, they should pick our cause area instead. I do think we measure up nicely. It is critically important. It's literally 9 billion land animals and even more sea animals just in the United States every single year. It has never happened that a technology was better than another technology and didn't completely replace the technology that it was better than. So it's like super hyper tractable, and it's neglected. GFI, we're literally the only organization doing the vast majority of the work that we&nbsp;do.</p><p>There are a couple of organizations where there is very slight overlap, but it's really very slight overlap, like the guy who I hope will go to China and get a job in China, he's literally the only person on the planet probably who's going to go to China with the idea of figuring out how to bring plant-based meat and clean meat to China. And there are a lot of other opportunities like that with plant-based meat and clean meat where it's literally the case that if you don't it, it won't get done. It's tractable and it's unusually important, and again, I'm delighted to have that conversation with really anybody&nbsp;here.</p>", "user": {"username": "The Centre for Effective Altruism"}}, {"_id": "E3oaWxsp3eu6dw9gB", "title": "Marie Gibbons and Natalie Cargill: Meat without suffering", "postedAt": "2018-06-08T07:15:00.000Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k38qJcXJqPs&amp;list=PLwp9xeoX5p8P3cDQwlyN7qsFhC9Ms4L5W&amp;index=6\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k38qJcXJqPs\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><hr><p><i>\u201cClean meat\u201d, or meat grown independently from an animal nervous system, is one of the most promising interventions for reducing animal suffering; if we can more cheaply create meat without hurting animals, then market forces could reduce or eliminate factory farming for good.

Some of the traits that we are looking for within the cells are being fast and easy to grow, long lasting and flexible. I want to jump in on this a little bit. These are four different types of cells that we are able to currently grow in the lab and use to make&nbsp;meat.</p><p>We have access to embryonic stem cells that we can use to make several different meat types. We can also use mesenchymal stem cells; those are stem cells that are found naturally within adult bodies. So if you have an issue with taking embryonic stem cells to create meat, we can instead take biopsies, take cell types from individual adults and make meat that way. Additionally, we can take cells from individual cell types such as satellite cells, which is kind of like a baby muscle cell. Satellite cells aren't as immature as stem cells, but they're still pretty young, so we can kind of train them to do something else if we want&nbsp;to.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2W4W6gStteEsacoc0AEm0u/5e70a2924a78ce507c8d8aab175f0528/Clean_Meat_2.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2W4W6gStteEsacoc0AEm0u/5e70a2924a78ce507c8d8aab175f0528/Clean_Meat_2.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2W4W6gStteEsacoc0AEm0u/5e70a2924a78ce507c8d8aab175f0528/Clean_Meat_2.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2W4W6gStteEsacoc0AEm0u/5e70a2924a78ce507c8d8aab175f0528/Clean_Meat_2.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2W4W6gStteEsacoc0AEm0u/5e70a2924a78ce507c8d8aab175f0528/Clean_Meat_2.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2W4W6gStteEsacoc0AEm0u/5e70a2924a78ce507c8d8aab175f0528/Clean_Meat_2.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2W4W6gStteEsacoc0AEm0u/5e70a2924a78ce507c8d8aab175f0528/Clean_Meat_2.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>And then, additionally, we can actually do something called induced pluripotency where we can take theoretically any type of cell: We can take a feather, we can take a hair follicle, we can take a skin scraping or we can take a cheek swab, and theoretically, we can turn those into stem cells, and then in turn we can turn them into any cell type that we want. I'm saying \"in theory\" a lot because we haven't been able to take any cell out there and turn it into any cell that we want to, but we have been able to take a lot of different cell types and turn them into specific cell types of interest. I think that's a really exciting area of research that needs further&nbsp;exploration.</p><p>The next thing that I want to talk about is the ability for us to avoid continuously harvesting new cells from animals. So if we want to be able to take these cells and have them continuously grow without needing to collect new ones from animals over and over again, we need to start thinking about how we can keep these cells in a state where they are technically immortal. So with that I want to get into a little bit of cellular anatomy, so bear with me, and I'll walk you through this slide a little&nbsp;bit.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3MsmSuivteUw6eG8yY8C2o/9d95d58402c3117afa2ab28de1da96ae/Clean_Meat_3.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3MsmSuivteUw6eG8yY8C2o/9d95d58402c3117afa2ab28de1da96ae/Clean_Meat_3.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3MsmSuivteUw6eG8yY8C2o/9d95d58402c3117afa2ab28de1da96ae/Clean_Meat_3.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3MsmSuivteUw6eG8yY8C2o/9d95d58402c3117afa2ab28de1da96ae/Clean_Meat_3.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3MsmSuivteUw6eG8yY8C2o/9d95d58402c3117afa2ab28de1da96ae/Clean_Meat_3.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3MsmSuivteUw6eG8yY8C2o/9d95d58402c3117afa2ab28de1da96ae/Clean_Meat_3.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3MsmSuivteUw6eG8yY8C2o/9d95d58402c3117afa2ab28de1da96ae/Clean_Meat_3.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Here we have our cells again. This little green sphere here is what I like to call the cell brain, also known as the nucleus. Within the nucleus is all of the genetic information that is necessary to take an individual cell and turn that into billions of cells that make up something like a human being. That genetic information is also known as DNA, and DNA is usually wrapped up in a form of something called chromatin, which is what we are seeing here in that little X shape. And what happens is eventually this chromatin, as cells divide and the chromatin is also copied and passed onto future generations of cells, over time, about 60 cell divisions in, we hit something called a Hayflick&nbsp;limit.</p><p>What happens is as our cells divide, the machinery that's required for the DNA to be replicated isn't 100% efficient. So the ends of the chromosomes actually get worn down a little bit with every cell division. If you see on the chromatin structure, the ends are lime green. I don't think that chromatin is actually hot pink and lime green. I haven't personally seen real chromatin before; it's very small, so I think that this is just a visual. But the lime green is something that's called a telomere, and what those do is they serve as a buffer during every cellular division. But, again, over time this cellular division will eventually wear down all of the telomeres, and then wear down important genes that are required for things like metabolism or telling the cell to not destroy itself, because literally if a cell doesn't know what to do it's going to self&nbsp;destruct.</p><p>But anyway, luckily we have been able to discover a protein called telomerase, and telomerase acts by adding telomeres back onto your chromosomes, so the more research that we do into telomerase the more that we can understand in terms of large scale meat production, but we can also look into more things like curing diseases, curing aging and understanding how cancer works. So, there's a lot of really exciting research going on with&nbsp;telomerase.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7jGuosLOhic4yeqwo4iciw/d8b1f553292b616e66bd9c8d792d7478/Clean_Meat_4.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7jGuosLOhic4yeqwo4iciw/d8b1f553292b616e66bd9c8d792d7478/Clean_Meat_4.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7jGuosLOhic4yeqwo4iciw/d8b1f553292b616e66bd9c8d792d7478/Clean_Meat_4.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7jGuosLOhic4yeqwo4iciw/d8b1f553292b616e66bd9c8d792d7478/Clean_Meat_4.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7jGuosLOhic4yeqwo4iciw/d8b1f553292b616e66bd9c8d792d7478/Clean_Meat_4.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7jGuosLOhic4yeqwo4iciw/d8b1f553292b616e66bd9c8d792d7478/Clean_Meat_4.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7jGuosLOhic4yeqwo4iciw/d8b1f553292b616e66bd9c8d792d7478/Clean_Meat_4.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>The next thing I want to address in terms of the types of cells that we want is flexibility. So just off the top of my head I can think of at least seven different cell types that are needed in order to make up meat. On the top we have our skin cells, we have our bone cells, we have our blood cells, fat cells, cells that are responsible for making connective tissue. We also have neurons, and then of course muscle. So these are all seven very different types of cells. And it would be ideal if we would be able to take a cell type, really understand how to grow it in a controlled setting, and then also be able to get these cells to differentiate and change into all of these different cell types. And that's something that has already been shown to be doable. We can do it through media additives. We can even do it through the architecture of the scaffolding that we're putting the cells on. And additionally we can do that through genetic&nbsp;editing.</p><h2>The Media</h2><p>With that I want to talk a little bit more about the next bottleneck, which is the media, or \"cell food\". The media, when you think about the role of media, the first thing is that it needs to provide an adequate environment for the cells to live in, basically tricking the cells into thinking that they're still inside an animal. We need the right pH, the right temperature, the right osmotic pressure so the cells don't explode. They like to explode if they're not happy. Media also provide a lot of vitamins and minerals, as well as lipids. A lot of cells are actually made up of lipid. Cell skin is just a lipid membrane, so lots of fats are needed in order to keep cells happy. The other thing is protein. Obviously in order for one cell to turn into two cells they are going to need building blocks to actually make another cell. And, finally, growth&nbsp;factors.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/44dn61pHOgUIUGkM0gIA2I/f51fb659a04d497e2bfaf947e6d131d5/Clean_Meat_5.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/44dn61pHOgUIUGkM0gIA2I/f51fb659a04d497e2bfaf947e6d131d5/Clean_Meat_5.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/44dn61pHOgUIUGkM0gIA2I/f51fb659a04d497e2bfaf947e6d131d5/Clean_Meat_5.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/44dn61pHOgUIUGkM0gIA2I/f51fb659a04d497e2bfaf947e6d131d5/Clean_Meat_5.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/44dn61pHOgUIUGkM0gIA2I/f51fb659a04d497e2bfaf947e6d131d5/Clean_Meat_5.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/44dn61pHOgUIUGkM0gIA2I/f51fb659a04d497e2bfaf947e6d131d5/Clean_Meat_5.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/44dn61pHOgUIUGkM0gIA2I/f51fb659a04d497e2bfaf947e6d131d5/Clean_Meat_5.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>The cool thing is that out of all of these requirements, we've been able to use plants in order to produce four. The one hiccup, though, is growth factors. That is the main issue in terms of the bottlenecks, in terms of the cost of making meat right now. This is why a chicken nugget is going to be $400 if we're growing it instead of harvesting it from an&nbsp;animal.</p><p>I want to talk a little bit about where we are currently getting our growth factors as well as some of the options for where we can get them later on. Originally we were getting our growth factors from baby cows. Obviously we cannot do that, so now we've started to get them through recombinant protein production. We're replacing cows with bioreactors. You guys see the foreshadowing that I'm doing here. We are able to do something called recombinant protein production where we actually take the gene that's associated with this protein or the growth factor, put it inside of a bacterium, have these bacteria grow up very fast and at very high yields, and then harvest the proteins from the bacteria. But there are other options as well. We can explore plant based growth factors or analogues. We might even be able to use chemical synthesis of the proteins that are found in plants in order to replicate these growth&nbsp;factors.</p><p>And we can also isolate growth factors from cells that naturally produce them in the body, which is where we're actually getting them from when we harvest blood from baby cows. Rather than making a cow we can just grow the cells that are responsible for growing the growth factors to begin&nbsp;with.</p><p>There is one other option that I want to explore with you, and in doing so first we need to walk through the role of a growth&nbsp;factor.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5oMjTtbb4kE26MkUmkUYkY/50038acf545f67e058ea11fcd59d6ccb/Clean_Meat_6.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5oMjTtbb4kE26MkUmkUYkY/50038acf545f67e058ea11fcd59d6ccb/Clean_Meat_6.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5oMjTtbb4kE26MkUmkUYkY/50038acf545f67e058ea11fcd59d6ccb/Clean_Meat_6.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5oMjTtbb4kE26MkUmkUYkY/50038acf545f67e058ea11fcd59d6ccb/Clean_Meat_6.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5oMjTtbb4kE26MkUmkUYkY/50038acf545f67e058ea11fcd59d6ccb/Clean_Meat_6.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5oMjTtbb4kE26MkUmkUYkY/50038acf545f67e058ea11fcd59d6ccb/Clean_Meat_6.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5oMjTtbb4kE26MkUmkUYkY/50038acf545f67e058ea11fcd59d6ccb/Clean_Meat_6.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>The growth factor serves as a form of a signal, so in this demonstration it's what the ligand is representing; it's produced and released by another cell. It then binds to the target cell's cell surface receptor, and then when that happens it triggers an intracellular pathway, and in response to this pathway we get a genetic transcription change. That, in turn, is what causes the growth. What I'm exploring right now is this bit right here, this genetic transcription, and trying to really cut out all of the middle men. Instead of relying on these growth factors in order to get the cell to do what I want, which is grow, I'm actually just designing a gene sequence that allows the cell, assuming that it has all the nutrients that it needs, to just continuously grow until we take it out of the environment that it's not happy in&nbsp;anymore.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5XNgp9bAf6I4IiOWuQMCIW/f504e7500dba588e812a3872c93afd85/Clean_Meat_7.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5XNgp9bAf6I4IiOWuQMCIW/f504e7500dba588e812a3872c93afd85/Clean_Meat_7.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5XNgp9bAf6I4IiOWuQMCIW/f504e7500dba588e812a3872c93afd85/Clean_Meat_7.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5XNgp9bAf6I4IiOWuQMCIW/f504e7500dba588e812a3872c93afd85/Clean_Meat_7.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5XNgp9bAf6I4IiOWuQMCIW/f504e7500dba588e812a3872c93afd85/Clean_Meat_7.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5XNgp9bAf6I4IiOWuQMCIW/f504e7500dba588e812a3872c93afd85/Clean_Meat_7.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5XNgp9bAf6I4IiOWuQMCIW/f504e7500dba588e812a3872c93afd85/Clean_Meat_7.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>I'm currently working on that at Harvard Medical School with Dr. Church, who, by the way, I met at EA Global last year.

So, these are some of the tools that I'm working on right&nbsp;now.</p><h2>The Bioreactors</h2><p>I'd like to end with the bioreactors. My money is on large scale suspension growth because that's currently what pharmaceutical companies are using right now. What we're looking for is something that's energy efficient, sterile, easy to use, and obviously scalable. So far we are able to get muscle cells to grow in suspension, so all we're needing to do now is tweak that. In terms of energy efficiency the first thing that I saw when I Googled solar-powered bioreactor was this baby right here. Obviously we need a little bit of work to go before we have that happening. But in terms of sterility, again this is something that biopharmaceutical industries are using constantly. This is only a 2,000 liter reactor. They've gotten up to 400,000 liters, so they're already doing a lot of the work for&nbsp;us.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3KncsyyXIsW40SaCqAOoom/4ac4c3708c7aef36a67e239f5fdc3921/Clean_Meat_8.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3KncsyyXIsW40SaCqAOoom/4ac4c3708c7aef36a67e239f5fdc3921/Clean_Meat_8.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3KncsyyXIsW40SaCqAOoom/4ac4c3708c7aef36a67e239f5fdc3921/Clean_Meat_8.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3KncsyyXIsW40SaCqAOoom/4ac4c3708c7aef36a67e239f5fdc3921/Clean_Meat_8.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3KncsyyXIsW40SaCqAOoom/4ac4c3708c7aef36a67e239f5fdc3921/Clean_Meat_8.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3KncsyyXIsW40SaCqAOoom/4ac4c3708c7aef36a67e239f5fdc3921/Clean_Meat_8.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3KncsyyXIsW40SaCqAOoom/4ac4c3708c7aef36a67e239f5fdc3921/Clean_Meat_8.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>And in terms of easy to use, I have personally also already used one, so if I can do it you guys can do it too. If you know how to use a computer, and you know how to work a hose, and you know not to sneeze where you're not supposed to sneeze, you can grow meat in a bioreactor. With that, I want to leave you with this image, which is a current large scale cell production facility used for&nbsp;biopharmaceuticals.</p><p>It might look a little complicated, might look a little expensive, and I would agree with you. But I would say in comparison to what large scale meat production facilities look like right now, this is definitely a step up.

There are three things I'd like to&nbsp;say.</p><p>First of all, a lot of the polls, both formal and informal, are methodologically lacking and not particularly useful. That said, the second thing is that even given all of those limitations, it's clear that the number of people who are interested in consuming clean meat is very, very high, so there's a lot of potential there. And thirdly, there are ways in which we can frame clean meat to make it even more attractive to consumers and to institutions. As the name of this talk suggests, we've already made significant progress with \"clean\" meat as one framing step, and there are others that we're thinking about and&nbsp;researching.</p><h2>Polls</h2><p>First, on to the existing informal polls. These go back to 2012, which I believe is the equivalent of millennia in clean meat years, but even in those early days, in The Guardian at least, around 70% of people said they would eat lab-grown meat. Clean meat, of course, ultimately will not be \"lab-grown\" meat. I think the 2014 poll shows something that was lacking from earlier polls in The Guardian in that it actually asked people about how they felt about clean meat as an alternative to conventional factory farmed meat, rather than whether they would eat it in a sort of futuristic or hypothetical setting. The Mirror, hopefully not too reflective of British society standards, was also fairly optimistic in its 2016 poll. I think the Sam Harris Twitter poll, another not completely formal methodology, was extremely promising. And the latest Memphis Meats Survey again looks very&nbsp;promising.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1FAENF8QPKg8IwkMEUQ8Oa/91ba81f484e413184e4467ef8e76979e/Clean_Meat_10.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1FAENF8QPKg8IwkMEUQ8Oa/91ba81f484e413184e4467ef8e76979e/Clean_Meat_10.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1FAENF8QPKg8IwkMEUQ8Oa/91ba81f484e413184e4467ef8e76979e/Clean_Meat_10.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1FAENF8QPKg8IwkMEUQ8Oa/91ba81f484e413184e4467ef8e76979e/Clean_Meat_10.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1FAENF8QPKg8IwkMEUQ8Oa/91ba81f484e413184e4467ef8e76979e/Clean_Meat_10.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1FAENF8QPKg8IwkMEUQ8Oa/91ba81f484e413184e4467ef8e76979e/Clean_Meat_10.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1FAENF8QPKg8IwkMEUQ8Oa/91ba81f484e413184e4467ef8e76979e/Clean_Meat_10.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Of course there is a huge number of problems with these kinds of pollings.

It was widely reported as demonstrating clean meat wasn't going to be particularly well accepted, but actually the 2,000 people polled in that survey were asked how we can solve the problem of the meat industry. There were a number of options such as eat less meat, eat no meat, support plant-based meat or clean meat, and participants could only make one choice. So this study really tells us nothing about how we can expect consumers to adopt clean&nbsp;meat.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2aIPi1jMHOAWq2GYySeGme/3e6ca1faa82bc6f43df23f107ccce148/Clean_Meat_12.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2aIPi1jMHOAWq2GYySeGme/3e6ca1faa82bc6f43df23f107ccce148/Clean_Meat_12.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2aIPi1jMHOAWq2GYySeGme/3e6ca1faa82bc6f43df23f107ccce148/Clean_Meat_12.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2aIPi1jMHOAWq2GYySeGme/3e6ca1faa82bc6f43df23f107ccce148/Clean_Meat_12.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2aIPi1jMHOAWq2GYySeGme/3e6ca1faa82bc6f43df23f107ccce148/Clean_Meat_12.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2aIPi1jMHOAWq2GYySeGme/3e6ca1faa82bc6f43df23f107ccce148/Clean_Meat_12.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2aIPi1jMHOAWq2GYySeGme/3e6ca1faa82bc6f43df23f107ccce148/Clean_Meat_12.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Okay, the point that I think those earlier formal and informal polls make is that even if we take them at face value, and say okay, even if less than 50%, even if only 10% or 20% of consumers are going to be interested in adopting clean meat, that is huge. The current plant-based meat market is less than half a percent of the market for meat, and yet companies in that space are doing fantastically well. So even on the most pessimistic view of these surveys, which I think is incorrect, we have reason to be hugely&nbsp;optimistic.</p><h2>Framings</h2><p>Okay, I'll turn now to some of the things we can do to frame clean meat accurately, and to maximize the chances of consumer adoption going as well as possible. The first hurdle was really the name, and I think that's something that's now been well established and for the right reasons. \"Clean meat\" has been picked up by the vast majority of media outlets and has really been a very significant shift from \"lab-based meat\" and \"cultured meat\", which were confusing and misleading, towards \"clean meat\", which is both a nod to the clean energy sector, and emphasizes that this meat is genuinely just less dirty than the meat produced in the conditions on factory&nbsp;farms.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1ROv40mIp2scO06EywWIK8/33d2f8b85bf6c6b21826082731e1696b/Clean_Meat_13.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1ROv40mIp2scO06EywWIK8/33d2f8b85bf6c6b21826082731e1696b/Clean_Meat_13.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1ROv40mIp2scO06EywWIK8/33d2f8b85bf6c6b21826082731e1696b/Clean_Meat_13.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1ROv40mIp2scO06EywWIK8/33d2f8b85bf6c6b21826082731e1696b/Clean_Meat_13.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1ROv40mIp2scO06EywWIK8/33d2f8b85bf6c6b21826082731e1696b/Clean_Meat_13.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1ROv40mIp2scO06EywWIK8/33d2f8b85bf6c6b21826082731e1696b/Clean_Meat_13.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1ROv40mIp2scO06EywWIK8/33d2f8b85bf6c6b21826082731e1696b/Clean_Meat_13.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Here we have a graph by GFI, which was published I think a month or so ago, showing the rise of clean meat usage.

Framing is really important. One particularly interesting challenge that will be addressed soon is this feeling that clean meat is somehow not natural. There's been some interesting research on&nbsp;this.</p><p>There are a number of approaches I think might be viable going forward. One of those could be to say actually no, it's not natural, but the natural way in which we're producing meat at the moment is fraught with problems, and things that aren't natural, such as antibiotics, have been hugely beneficial. Another way could be to stress the fact that clean meat is, to a large extent, natural in that cells are growing as they naturally would. Whether that's in an animal or in a bioreactor is in some sense beside the point. There are also other framings that can challenge how people perceive the natural to be&nbsp;good.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4hMbXBobuoSE2KEQEAgEkW/3cba574d4713b1693f29e856ba01aa82/Clean_Meat_15.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4hMbXBobuoSE2KEQEAgEkW/3cba574d4713b1693f29e856ba01aa82/Clean_Meat_15.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4hMbXBobuoSE2KEQEAgEkW/3cba574d4713b1693f29e856ba01aa82/Clean_Meat_15.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4hMbXBobuoSE2KEQEAgEkW/3cba574d4713b1693f29e856ba01aa82/Clean_Meat_15.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4hMbXBobuoSE2KEQEAgEkW/3cba574d4713b1693f29e856ba01aa82/Clean_Meat_15.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4hMbXBobuoSE2KEQEAgEkW/3cba574d4713b1693f29e856ba01aa82/Clean_Meat_15.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4hMbXBobuoSE2KEQEAgEkW/3cba574d4713b1693f29e856ba01aa82/Clean_Meat_15.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Faunalytics is in partnership with GFI and funded by ACE, conducting an experiment that is ongoing at the moment to address how we should frame clean meat in a wider&nbsp;context.</p><h1>Q&amp;A</h1><p><strong>Question:</strong> If we're unable to get to a clean meat future, if 100 years from now, with all the work and energy that goes into it, we still can't get there, what do you think is the most likely reason that we won't get&nbsp;there?</p><p><strong>Marie:</strong> I honestly think that the biology is there. The only reason why we could have any sort of hardship in terms of not getting there physically would probably be due to social issues, whether it be regulations put in place, or laws put in place to make sure that it doesn't happen, considering who we have fighting against us. But the biology, in my opinion, is there and ready, so it would be social issues:&nbsp;haters.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> Speaking of possible haters, I was surprised to see the acceptance, seemingly, of using the term \"meat\" from the meat industry.

The context of that comment from the North American Meat Institute was the US Cattleman's Association, which had put forward a petition saying we can't call clean meat \"meat\", and this was opposed by the institution, which contains Tyson and Cargill. I think this is promising because it suggests they see themselves as part of the protein industry, the meat production industry, and not the farming industry. So I think that's encouraging.

We can break down practical endeavors into three components. We can look at our primary goal, our evaluation standard, and our focus area. So if our primary goal as EAs is to help others as effectively as possible, then we might define our evaluation standard as improving the quality of life or reducing the suffering of moral patients. And so the simple case we might make for wild animal suffering, is that suffering experiences in the wild are intense and frequent, and they affect an enormous number of beings. The majority of animals are short-lived and they experience many forms of prolonged chronic suffering like hunger, injury, parasitism, and disease. Reducing the suffering experiences of wild animals will improve the lives of a large percentage of moral patients. So, if we have cost-effective solutions, we should work on resolving the&nbsp;problem.</p><p>Now, an example of a crucial consideration here would be, \"Well, what if wild animals can't suffer?\" In that case, our interventions aren't adding any value and pursuing the goal would be pointless because we're not actually doing any good. One point before I move on, though, is that I think there is very strong evidence that many wild animals can&nbsp;suffer.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3tiFwHlrGMwkqKusyCUIcg/16c7b47efcf8921e4a1843903d19dc0d/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx.png?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3tiFwHlrGMwkqKusyCUIcg/16c7b47efcf8921e4a1843903d19dc0d/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx.png?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3tiFwHlrGMwkqKusyCUIcg/16c7b47efcf8921e4a1843903d19dc0d/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx.png?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3tiFwHlrGMwkqKusyCUIcg/16c7b47efcf8921e4a1843903d19dc0d/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx.png?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3tiFwHlrGMwkqKusyCUIcg/16c7b47efcf8921e4a1843903d19dc0d/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx.png?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3tiFwHlrGMwkqKusyCUIcg/16c7b47efcf8921e4a1843903d19dc0d/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx.png?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3tiFwHlrGMwkqKusyCUIcg/16c7b47efcf8921e4a1843903d19dc0d/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx.png?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>I defined the evaluation standard as improving the quality of life and reducing the suffering of moral patients. But what constitutes a moral patient depends on one's worldview. So here I'm using the categories of worldviews that the Open Philanthropy Project uses, just to maintain consistency in terminology. So we have a <i>long-termist</i> worldview which assigns very high value to the future; a <i>near-termist, human-centric</i> worldview, which assigns value to improving the lives of humans in a relatively shorter time frame; and then a <i>near-termist, animal-inclusive</i> view, which cares about improving the lives of humans and also gives significant moral weight to animals in a shorter time&nbsp;frame.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/aSSlkwZs52C8S6K8SY4o8/e21acfb9bb49386a502d55228d44b537/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__1_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/aSSlkwZs52C8S6K8SY4o8/e21acfb9bb49386a502d55228d44b537/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__1_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/aSSlkwZs52C8S6K8SY4o8/e21acfb9bb49386a502d55228d44b537/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__1_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/aSSlkwZs52C8S6K8SY4o8/e21acfb9bb49386a502d55228d44b537/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__1_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/aSSlkwZs52C8S6K8SY4o8/e21acfb9bb49386a502d55228d44b537/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__1_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/aSSlkwZs52C8S6K8SY4o8/e21acfb9bb49386a502d55228d44b537/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__1_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/aSSlkwZs52C8S6K8SY4o8/e21acfb9bb49386a502d55228d44b537/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__1_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>So clearly, from a near-termist, human-centric worldview, wild animals are not moral patients, and so if you subscribe to this view you wouldn't really prioritize wild animal suffering. Also, from a near-termist, animal-inclusive worldview, you would consider that at least some wild animals have the capacity to suffer and might be moral patients. And whether or not you prioritize wild animal suffering then depends on how cost-effective the cause area&nbsp;is.</p><p>So what's really interesting is the long-termist worldview. We usually, when we talk about a long-termist worldview, we talk about the enormous number of people who will exist in the long-term future. The basic argument is that because the number of people who could exist in the long-term future is so large, the long-term future dwarfs all near-term considerations, and so we focus our altruistic efforts on putting humans on a positive trajectory so that we have the capacity to reach our full potential. This view focuses largely on helping humans, and it's silent on whether it gives moral weight to nonhumans. It's not clear to me whether it's implicitly included, but since it could be a catastrophic oversight if we didn't include nonhuman moral patients, for those of us who subscribe to an inclusive worldview, what we might want to do is have this category called the <i>long-termist, nonhuman-inclusive</i> worldview. Which, very similar to the near-termist, animal-inclusive worldview, cares about ensuring that humans flourish, and also cares about ensuring that we improve the lives of nonhumans, should they&nbsp;exist.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3rOKqdak3ueIQm2GoyMIEW/982b3d8c407263623e2e2f4ba3bd609d/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__2_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3rOKqdak3ueIQm2GoyMIEW/982b3d8c407263623e2e2f4ba3bd609d/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__2_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3rOKqdak3ueIQm2GoyMIEW/982b3d8c407263623e2e2f4ba3bd609d/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__2_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3rOKqdak3ueIQm2GoyMIEW/982b3d8c407263623e2e2f4ba3bd609d/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__2_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3rOKqdak3ueIQm2GoyMIEW/982b3d8c407263623e2e2f4ba3bd609d/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__2_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3rOKqdak3ueIQm2GoyMIEW/982b3d8c407263623e2e2f4ba3bd609d/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__2_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3rOKqdak3ueIQm2GoyMIEW/982b3d8c407263623e2e2f4ba3bd609d/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__2_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>So what I'm going to do now is focus on the near-termist, animal-inclusive and the long-termist, nonhuman-inclusive worldviews, and look at some crucial considerations for both of these. Let's start with the near-termist. The strength of the case for why wild animal suffering is a priority from a near-termist view is the scale, and we can look at the scale of the problem using a few different measures. It's important that we do use a few different measures, because no single measure is perfectly accurate. So we can look at abundance, using farmed vertebrates as a reference&nbsp;point.</p><h2>Near-termist, animal-inclusive view</h2><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6ytJB5F83Ki8eWUwAqEuC6/516e0abc597de97db92a75957dc4c0eb/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__3_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6ytJB5F83Ki8eWUwAqEuC6/516e0abc597de97db92a75957dc4c0eb/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__3_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6ytJB5F83Ki8eWUwAqEuC6/516e0abc597de97db92a75957dc4c0eb/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__3_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6ytJB5F83Ki8eWUwAqEuC6/516e0abc597de97db92a75957dc4c0eb/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__3_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6ytJB5F83Ki8eWUwAqEuC6/516e0abc597de97db92a75957dc4c0eb/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__3_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6ytJB5F83Ki8eWUwAqEuC6/516e0abc597de97db92a75957dc4c0eb/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__3_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6ytJB5F83Ki8eWUwAqEuC6/516e0abc597de97db92a75957dc4c0eb/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__3_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>This chart is on a log scale, so each unit is one order of magnitude greater than the one before it.

For neurons, we have even less information. The information that we have for farmed vertebrates only covers chickens and cows, and we end up with 0.009 sextillion neurons combined. For wild vertebrates, we have 44 sextillion, and for invertebrates we have 217 sextillion. Another interesting point here is that the number of neurons for wild vertebrates is dominated by fish. So the absence of fish in our farmed vertebrate estimate also contributes to there being such a large ratio between farmed vertebrates and wild vertebrates.</p><p>The conclusion we might draw from these measures of scale is that when we talk about the problem, invertebrates dominate according to every measure. But there are a few caveats that we want to keep in mind. Firstly, the abundance comparisons between farmed vertebrates and wild vertebrates make an assumption that the lives of farmed vertebrates are equal to those of wild vertebrates. However, they don't take into account the comparison of the disutility between farmed lives and wild lives. Abundance measures also equate vertebrate lives with invertebrate lives, and that's very likely to be inaccurate. I'll discuss how we might want to work with the value of invertebrate lives a little bit further into the&nbsp;talk.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5i26Hv79QAGAmKqA0q6MkO/224245d59556d045f41331de44fcd17e/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__6_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5i26Hv79QAGAmKqA0q6MkO/224245d59556d045f41331de44fcd17e/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__6_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5i26Hv79QAGAmKqA0q6MkO/224245d59556d045f41331de44fcd17e/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__6_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5i26Hv79QAGAmKqA0q6MkO/224245d59556d045f41331de44fcd17e/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__6_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5i26Hv79QAGAmKqA0q6MkO/224245d59556d045f41331de44fcd17e/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__6_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5i26Hv79QAGAmKqA0q6MkO/224245d59556d045f41331de44fcd17e/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__6_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5i26Hv79QAGAmKqA0q6MkO/224245d59556d045f41331de44fcd17e/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__6_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Because we have such a simplistic model when we think about the scale, we also want to think about what sorts of considerations might have a drastic effect on the expected value of our efforts. And we can break this down into two different categories: We can look at the number of moral patients affected, and the severity of their experiences. And so we need to ask questions like, are invertebrates moral patients? Are fetuses moral patients? What about larvae? How do we decide on the moral weight between different kinds of moral patients? That includes not just deciding between the moral weight of an ant versus a cow, but also an ant versus a nematode. We also need to consider the severity of various sorts of negative experiences. How bad are different ways of dying? How prevalent is chronic pain in the wild? And, are there degrees in the capacity to feel pain? I'm not going to try and answer any of these in this talk; these are each a talk in and of themselves.

When we exclude invertebrates, we see abundance drop from 10 orders of magnitude to 3, we see biomass drop from 17 times to 7 times larger, and neuron count drops from 5 to 4 orders of magnitude. When we combine these decreases with how uncertain the tractability of wild animal suffering is, then it might then be plausible that wild animal suffering is not the right focus area from a near-term, animal-inclusive perspective, and therefore that it's not a good candidate for our prioritization. But I think it's pretty unlikely that we can confidently say that invertebrates are not moral patients. There are a few&nbsp;reasons:</p><p>The first reason is that we don't have a clearly defined measure of moral patienthood. What we tend to do when we try and understand who constitutes a moral patient, is we look at features of humans. Since we consider ourselves moral patients, we extrapolate from our own features to see whether animals might share them. So we might look at subjective experiences: does an animal recognize itself in a mirror? We might look at cognitive complexity: do animals use tools, or do they have a complex language? Or we might look at an animal's ability to demonstrate pain-avoidance or pleasure-seeking behavior, and then try to understand: is their behavior mechanical or is it deliberate? Are there elements of learning&nbsp;involved?</p><p>The second reason why we can't really confidently say that invertebrates are not moral patients, is that experts reasonably disagree on whether invertebrates even fulfill that criterion. So there are some studies that demonstrate invertebrates expressing pain-avoidance behavior, and then there are others where invertebrates don't express that behavior. And so with this uncertainty, it's very potentially dangerous to ignore the potential moral patienthood of invertebrates, but we also can't confidently conclude that they are moral patients. So what can we&nbsp;do?</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/69H3Zb1LjOIym0ooGMSu8Y/4686ed7e1eff3efcb8b854aca23ef1d7/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__8_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/69H3Zb1LjOIym0ooGMSu8Y/4686ed7e1eff3efcb8b854aca23ef1d7/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__8_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/69H3Zb1LjOIym0ooGMSu8Y/4686ed7e1eff3efcb8b854aca23ef1d7/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__8_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/69H3Zb1LjOIym0ooGMSu8Y/4686ed7e1eff3efcb8b854aca23ef1d7/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__8_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/69H3Zb1LjOIym0ooGMSu8Y/4686ed7e1eff3efcb8b854aca23ef1d7/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__8_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/69H3Zb1LjOIym0ooGMSu8Y/4686ed7e1eff3efcb8b854aca23ef1d7/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__8_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/69H3Zb1LjOIym0ooGMSu8Y/4686ed7e1eff3efcb8b854aca23ef1d7/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__8_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>The first thing we can do is think about the precautionary principle, which just assumes invertebrates are moral patients, and then takes their interests into account in our actions. This makes sense in instances where we unnecessarily inflict potential suffering on invertebrates. For example, we could stop wearing silk, because the process of silk production involves boiling silk worms alive. Or we could advocate against the development of insect farms as an alternate source of animal-based protein. And that's not to say that we should support the existing farms, but that we might want to instead support plant-based protein, or clean meat. However, as a universal rule, the precautionary principle doesn't really work. It doesn't give us any guidance on how to weigh invertebrates relative to other moral patients. It doesn't give us guidance on how to weigh classes of invertebrates. And, it's not likely to always be cost-effective. And that means we could be wasting resources that are better applied&nbsp;elsewhere.</p><p>Another approach we might want to think about is expected value, and this should be very well understood by Effective Altrusits; we use this all the time. If we&nbsp;assume:</p><ul><li>P is the probability of invertebrates being moral&nbsp;patients,</li><li>P multiplied by the number of invertebrates is greater than or equal to the number of known moral&nbsp;patients,</li><li>invertebrates are moral patients,&nbsp;and</li><li>they matter equally per individual as&nbsp;vertebrates,</li></ul><p>then when we think only about invertebrates, wild animal suffering is on a greater scale than other focus areas in a \"near-termist, animal-inclusive\" worldview. So for example, we could assume that all humans and vertebrates are known moral patients. That would give us approximately ten trillion known moral patients. And so, if we give a probability of one in a million to invertebrates being moral patients, then the expected utility of helping invertebrates outweighs that of all other moral patients.

When we look at brain size, the reason we might think, \"Well, the size of a brain determines intelligence or cognitive complexity,\" is because the larger a brain size, the more cells it has, and the more energy is involved to develop more complex activities or more complex&nbsp;computations.</p><p>The problem with this approach is that an elephant has roughly a four times larger brain than humans, but we don't often consider elephants smarter than&nbsp;humans.</p><p>We could also look at the ratio of brain to body mass. Because the size of an elephant is so much larger than a human, a large percentage of neurons in an elephant brain are used on basic body functions, as opposed to more complex cognitive processes. Whereas for a human, we see a much smaller ratio of brain to body mass. But using ratios of brain to body mass, we run into trouble too: we have mice and ants, which have smaller ratios of brain to body mass than humans. In fact, smaller animals generally do have a smaller brain to body mass ratio than much larger&nbsp;animals.</p><p>So we might also want to look at total number of neurons, but again we see that when we just look at absolute size, it doesn't give us much guidance. Again, elephants have an absolute greater number of neurons than humans, which suggests they should be able to demonstrate more cognitive complexity than we do. One reason why they might not has to do with the structure and function of the brain. Some brain regions seem more important for cognitively complex tasks, so it may be better to measure these directly. In mammals, for example, most of our cognitively complex tasks are located in the cerebral cortex. And the cerebellum, by contrast, contains the neurons that focus on just keeping bodies&nbsp;functioning.</p><p>So finally, our approach is to compare the number of neurons in the cerebral cortex to the rest of the brain. Now we have this much more intuitive result, where an elephant has a ratio of one to fifty and a human has a ratio of one to five. Interestingly, we don't have results for an ant, because non-mammals don't have the same brain structure. So one problem we have with these measures is that they're not applicable across all species and across all&nbsp;taxa.</p><p>So, these sorts of measurement are basically what we have at hand to try and answer these questions. They're by no means perfect, and we lack a lot of data that we need to work on building before we have a very concrete way of answering the problem of weighing different sorts of animals as moral&nbsp;patients.</p><h2>Long-termist, nonhuman-inclusive view</h2><p>Next, let's look at the \"long-termist, nonhuman-inclusive\" view. What we're interested in is whether a focus on wild animal suffering increases the expected value of the future of humanity, and also the value of nonhumans that exist. Space colonization may mean that future humans export and multiply wild animal suffering into the universe, and therefore increase the scale of the problem. A related but more obscure problem is that advancements in artificial intelligence might lead to digital simulations of nature, and if those simulations contain moral patients, then that might also increase the&nbsp;problem.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6HbePDaHlYSUCmYkUw8O6m/f9bc5f0b9b4a57c0d51c3dd018467316/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__10_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6HbePDaHlYSUCmYkUw8O6m/f9bc5f0b9b4a57c0d51c3dd018467316/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__10_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6HbePDaHlYSUCmYkUw8O6m/f9bc5f0b9b4a57c0d51c3dd018467316/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__10_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6HbePDaHlYSUCmYkUw8O6m/f9bc5f0b9b4a57c0d51c3dd018467316/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__10_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6HbePDaHlYSUCmYkUw8O6m/f9bc5f0b9b4a57c0d51c3dd018467316/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__10_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6HbePDaHlYSUCmYkUw8O6m/f9bc5f0b9b4a57c0d51c3dd018467316/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__10_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/6HbePDaHlYSUCmYkUw8O6m/f9bc5f0b9b4a57c0d51c3dd018467316/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__10_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Long-term impacts of wild animal suffering are very difficult to measure, so what I've done here is taken the 80,000 hours quantitative framework, and extrapolated what I might score wild animal welfare. Note that this is very tentative and I don't encourage anyone to take this at face value. I'm using positively shaping AI as our reference point, and that gets a 15 out of 16 (this is on a log scale, where every two units equal an order of magnitude). Farm animal welfare scores a 13, and the reason is that more humane attitudes can increase the expected value of the future by between 0.1 and 1 percent. I think the same sort of reasoning applies to wild animal welfare. If efforts to reduce wild animal suffering will also increase humane attitudes, that might increase the expected value of the future, so wild animal welfare scores a 12. The reason I've given it 1 point less is because farm animal welfare is much more tractable. Through intense efforts in the present, we may be able to solve 10 to 90 percent of the problem. And it's not obvious to me that I can make an equally confident claim that we have the capacity through intense efforts to solve 10 to 90 percent of wild animal suffering. Therefore, I chose the lower bound for the&nbsp;scale.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3vP7vAaTfaIOkqcSKcWCq2/b26ccb808c2f88a752d8c3293d35cace/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__11_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3vP7vAaTfaIOkqcSKcWCq2/b26ccb808c2f88a752d8c3293d35cace/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__11_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3vP7vAaTfaIOkqcSKcWCq2/b26ccb808c2f88a752d8c3293d35cace/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__11_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3vP7vAaTfaIOkqcSKcWCq2/b26ccb808c2f88a752d8c3293d35cace/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__11_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3vP7vAaTfaIOkqcSKcWCq2/b26ccb808c2f88a752d8c3293d35cace/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__11_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3vP7vAaTfaIOkqcSKcWCq2/b26ccb808c2f88a752d8c3293d35cace/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__11_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3vP7vAaTfaIOkqcSKcWCq2/b26ccb808c2f88a752d8c3293d35cace/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__11_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>On the long-termist view, there are several crucial considerations to&nbsp;consider:</p><ul><li>Is there more disvalue than value in&nbsp;nature?</li><li>Do we expect future populations to care about nonhumans without our&nbsp;efforts?</li><li>Relatedly, do we expect them to expand their moral circle without our&nbsp;efforts?</li><li>Could space colonization spread wild animal&nbsp;suffering?</li><li>Could advancements in artificial intelligence create digital moral&nbsp;patients?</li><li>What population ethics do we subscribe&nbsp;to?</li><li>More generally, how durable are value&nbsp;systems?</li></ul><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2G1ZyUgqXCQqGI0MGockqo/955180b22306b55e718b240d94c696dd/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__12_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2G1ZyUgqXCQqGI0MGockqo/955180b22306b55e718b240d94c696dd/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__12_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2G1ZyUgqXCQqGI0MGockqo/955180b22306b55e718b240d94c696dd/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__12_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2G1ZyUgqXCQqGI0MGockqo/955180b22306b55e718b240d94c696dd/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__12_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2G1ZyUgqXCQqGI0MGockqo/955180b22306b55e718b240d94c696dd/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__12_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2G1ZyUgqXCQqGI0MGockqo/955180b22306b55e718b240d94c696dd/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__12_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2G1ZyUgqXCQqGI0MGockqo/955180b22306b55e718b240d94c696dd/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__12_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>These are all massive questions, so let's just look at the first one: <i>Is there more disvalue than value in nature?</i> This question is really interesting to answer, because if there is more disvalue than value and flipping the sign is impossible or intractable, then we have two obligations. We want to prevent nature spreading beyond Earth, and we want to prevent artificial simulations of nature being created. But trying to answer this question is extremely difficult, and even when we try and break it down into sub-components, what we realize is that the sub-components are themselves crucial considerations. To list some of these related crucial&nbsp;considerations:</p><ul><li>Which nonhumans are moral&nbsp;patients?</li><li>When we try and understand the ratio of disvalue to value in nature, who should we be including in our&nbsp;calculation?</li><li>Again, how do we weigh different moral&nbsp;patients?</li><li>How bad are negative experiences versus how good are positive&nbsp;experiences?</li><li>Is it appropriate to use an expected value calculation to just aggregate across species? For example, if longer-lived mammals have net positive lives and shorter-lived, smaller mammals have net negative lives, even if we include a moral weighting, is it appropriate to just aggregate across all of them and say, \"well, we think there is disvalue or value in&nbsp;nature?\"</li></ul><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3Y0ncFLuack4mGAq2KuUaw/9d912c28055fa63037db76c2598eb50e/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__14_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3Y0ncFLuack4mGAq2KuUaw/9d912c28055fa63037db76c2598eb50e/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__14_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3Y0ncFLuack4mGAq2KuUaw/9d912c28055fa63037db76c2598eb50e/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__14_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3Y0ncFLuack4mGAq2KuUaw/9d912c28055fa63037db76c2598eb50e/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__14_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3Y0ncFLuack4mGAq2KuUaw/9d912c28055fa63037db76c2598eb50e/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__14_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3Y0ncFLuack4mGAq2KuUaw/9d912c28055fa63037db76c2598eb50e/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__14_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3Y0ncFLuack4mGAq2KuUaw/9d912c28055fa63037db76c2598eb50e/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__14_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Nick Bostrom in his talk also covers a similar concern, the difficulty in trying to break down high level crucial considerations. To help with this challenge, he uses signposts, which are kind of like a concrete way to understand the direction we might want to be moving in. For, the signposts are pretty straightforward. We want to increase research because we want to improve the knowledge that we have. We want more humane attitudes because that makes it more likely that in the future humans will consider nonhumans morally. We might want to hold off on terraforming, space colonization, and nonhuman simulations and emulations, if they are irreversible. So if we create them, and we end up being unable to reverse them, and we're uncertain what the sign of that is, we could have potentially created an enormous amount of suffering&nbsp;unnecessarily.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/144Kto2GmCymEw2wE4YQ4Q/844d38585c8e8270a0bca22086323bb5/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__15_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/144Kto2GmCymEw2wE4YQ4Q/844d38585c8e8270a0bca22086323bb5/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__15_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/144Kto2GmCymEw2wE4YQ4Q/844d38585c8e8270a0bca22086323bb5/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__15_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/144Kto2GmCymEw2wE4YQ4Q/844d38585c8e8270a0bca22086323bb5/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__15_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/144Kto2GmCymEw2wE4YQ4Q/844d38585c8e8270a0bca22086323bb5/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__15_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/144Kto2GmCymEw2wE4YQ4Q/844d38585c8e8270a0bca22086323bb5/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__15_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/144Kto2GmCymEw2wE4YQ4Q/844d38585c8e8270a0bca22086323bb5/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__15_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Another approach we could take is to consider the moral value of information. This is based on a talk that Amanda Askell gave at EA Global last year. The basic idea if we have a belief about the effectiveness of an intervention with very little evidence, that belief has low resilience. And so where that's the case, assuming all else is equal, the value of new information is much higher. In our case, our belief in the net value or disvalue in nature is based on a very weak set of evidence, and so the resilience of this belief is low. If the resilience is low, then the expected values of actions that we take are not robust. We can't be confident in what the signs of our actions are. And so what this means, is it means we should invest in interventions that have a really high information value, conditional on their being relatively low cost to acquire. And comfortingly, I think this leads us to very similar conclusions as those we came to in the signpost, that we want to focus more on research, and that with more research we can increase humane&nbsp;attitudes.</p><p>Unfortunately, I have not left you with any answers in this talk, but if you found this really interesting and you're curious to learn more, or you're curious to figure out how you can contribute, the best advice I can give is to just learn, learn, and keep&nbsp;learning.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1haw3hfDacoa2SsScsyy6W/abd12bd7b54cfd8c2d3d21d9e4bbc79c/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__16_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1haw3hfDacoa2SsScsyy6W/abd12bd7b54cfd8c2d3d21d9e4bbc79c/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__16_.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1haw3hfDacoa2SsScsyy6W/abd12bd7b54cfd8c2d3d21d9e4bbc79c/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__16_.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1haw3hfDacoa2SsScsyy6W/abd12bd7b54cfd8c2d3d21d9e4bbc79c/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__16_.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1haw3hfDacoa2SsScsyy6W/abd12bd7b54cfd8c2d3d21d9e4bbc79c/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__16_.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1haw3hfDacoa2SsScsyy6W/abd12bd7b54cfd8c2d3d21d9e4bbc79c/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__16_.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1haw3hfDacoa2SsScsyy6W/abd12bd7b54cfd8c2d3d21d9e4bbc79c/UPDATED_-_Crucial_Considerations_for_Wild-Animal_Suffering.pptx__16_.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>So, these are some texts that I found really, really useful.

So if you're trying to understand whether you might want to prioritize farm animal welfare over wild animal welfare, for me the most important consideration is how much suffering is there in farmed animal welfare. And there's plausibly, throughout the duration of the life of a farm animal, more suffering than in the wild. The difference then, comes in the scale, which is that the number of wild animals is so much greater that maybe that outweighs farm animal welfare. But it's definitely not very clear. Another important thing to keep in mind is tractability. It's much more tractable to work on farm animal welfare than it is to work on wild animal&nbsp;suffering.</p><p>That's not to say that we shouldn't be working on wild animal suffering, but if you're interested in working on actionable interventions now, then farm animal welfare seems like the way to go. If you're interested in learning more about this potential other focus area, that could become one of the biggest near-term focus areas for us, then wild animal suffering seems like something that you'd be interested in supporting. But I would also encourage people to support both regardless. Because the main goal is to improve the welfare of all animals. And these are just two different problems that we've&nbsp;encountered.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> Why is biomass morally&nbsp;relevant?</p><p><strong>Persis:</strong> There's very little information on brain size and neurons in animals, but body mass and brain size are positively correlated in that the larger a body, the larger the brain, and so when we don't have information on the brain size or the number of neurons, we might use biomass basically as a proxy for that. But in and of itself it doesn't really have moral value. The weight of the being doesn't have moral value, it's just that the larger a being \u2013 most likely \u2013 the larger the brain. And therefore, potentially, depending on how we weigh brain size in terms of moral patienthood, that could be morally&nbsp;relevant.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> For those who are interested in doing direct work or active research now in this subject matter, what advice would you give&nbsp;them?</p><p><strong>Persis:</strong> It depends on your background. If you have a background in biology or ecology or neurobiology or any sort of domain expertise, then I would definitely encourage you to get in touch. We're hoping to create more opportunities for people with domain expertise to do some relevant research. I would also say, if you're based in academia, get to know supervisors within those departments and maybe try and sense how receptive they might be to different issues. In a lot of cases, even if they're not receptive specifically to wild animal welfare, they are just curious about answering these questions. And that might be sufficient to get more empirical&nbsp;information.</p><p>If you don't have domain expertise, then I would encourage volunteering and learning more about the sorts of outreach that we might want to do. Or perhaps the sort of advocacy that might be really useful on a broader scale, like anti-speciesism advocacy. That might be really useful, both for wild animal welfare and farm animal&nbsp;welfare.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> In terms of getting more information, where can people look and&nbsp;focus?</p><p><strong>Persis:</strong> There's a lot of different places that I think are really useful. I mean, the first one, I think, is better understanding the physiology of invertebrates. It would be good to better understand the structures of their brains, and better understand the experiences that they have. That's really important to us, because the more information we have, the more guidance we have in terms of figuring out whether they are moral patients and how we should be acting towards them. It also seems useful to study large scale environmental and ecosystem changes, assessing them and the effects that they have on large populations. So looking at population composition, population dynamics. For example, one academic I'm talking to is looking at why 80% of ticks congregate on 20% of a population. That's really interesting, because if there are things that attract ticks or things that deter ticks, then maybe we can use that and genetically edit that into other species and minimize the prevalence of&nbsp;parasitism.</p><p>Another thing we could look at is the effect of climate change on population composition. Which populations survive and adapt really well, which are really resilient, which aren't, and what might be the reason behind&nbsp;that?</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> Anything that at this point feels actionable, or is this all purely still in the research&nbsp;phase?</p><p><strong>Persis:</strong> So there's a lot of things that are currently actionable. We currently do large scale wildlife contraception on overabundant populations. That's already happening and it's already being trialed in a number of different cities. So that's something that is definitely actionable. We've run large-scale vaccination programs in the past, not to benefit wild animals, to benefit humans, but it's also something that was successful and it's demonstrated that we can do it. We also do a lot of potential harm to invertebrates through the use of insecticides. We do the same thing with population control for overabundant vertebrate species, and there are ways we can try to minimize that. For example, we can use gene drives to reduce the populations of overabundant species, rather than killing them through population control measures. We could look for humane insecticides, or humane alternatives to existing insecticides for insects in agriculture. So there are a lot of things that are really actionable on a large scale, and even on a small scale, things like just being paying attention to invertebrates that are in your sphere of existence and making sure you're not causing them undue&nbsp;harm.</p>", "user": {"username": "The Centre for Effective Altruism"}}, {"_id": "EZhktWfX35Kss4xpz", "title": "Lewis Bollard: Ending factory farming", "postedAt": "2018-06-08T07:15:00.000Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcAaWL0geRU&amp;list=PLwp9xeoX5p8P3cDQwlyN7qsFhC9Ms4L5W&amp;index=4\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WcAaWL0geRU\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><hr><p><i>While there are causes for optimism, factory farming is still on the rise globally, and we have to understand it to eliminate its harms.

So what you see in this graph is that over the last 50 years, the number of mammals alive on factory farms globally has barely increased, while the number of chickens alive at any point in time has significantly increased, up to a point of 23 billion alive at any point in time. That equates to over 60 billion slaughtered annually, because most of these chickens are broiler chickens who live short lives. And so when we think about what we can do to improve the plight of birds and particularly chickens, it comes down to two types of these birds.

It's hard to imagine a more intense form chronic suffering that you can inflict on an animal. We know from preference studies that these birds, given a chance to get to a nesting box, will push through a cage door as hard as they will to get to food after 24 hours of deprivation. So the mere fact that they're not getting access to a nesting box here - and we know there are similar desires to get to perches, to get to dust bathing ability - shows you the degree of behavioral deprivation inflicted on these animals, typically for more than a year at a&nbsp;time.</p><p>The good news is that there has been progress. The first progress that we've started to see has been over the last four years, initially in the US, going to corporations and securing pledges to get rid of battery cages. Now up to a point, those pledges, if implemented, will benefit about 275 million hens a year. Those campaigns have now gone international, working in Europe, in Latin America, increasingly in Asia, and have reached a point that those international pledges are set to benefit about 130 million hens a year if implemented.

Now that's a significant increase from a few years ago when there were fewer than 20 million cage free hens in the US, but obviously there's still a lot of work to be done, and so one of the priorities for the movement within affecting layer hens is getting the implementation of these pledges that have already been&nbsp;secured.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2zgzSlaUKUWGqWcOU0UQG0/c1bcb2ac74f698a633998af345cf0edf/Lewis_6.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2zgzSlaUKUWGqWcOU0UQG0/c1bcb2ac74f698a633998af345cf0edf/Lewis_6.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2zgzSlaUKUWGqWcOU0UQG0/c1bcb2ac74f698a633998af345cf0edf/Lewis_6.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2zgzSlaUKUWGqWcOU0UQG0/c1bcb2ac74f698a633998af345cf0edf/Lewis_6.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2zgzSlaUKUWGqWcOU0UQG0/c1bcb2ac74f698a633998af345cf0edf/Lewis_6.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2zgzSlaUKUWGqWcOU0UQG0/c1bcb2ac74f698a633998af345cf0edf/Lewis_6.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2zgzSlaUKUWGqWcOU0UQG0/c1bcb2ac74f698a633998af345cf0edf/Lewis_6.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>The other priority is reaching the other group of chickens, the broiler chickens. So as most of you probably know, broiler chickens are a different strain of chicken that are raised separately from laying hens, and are raised for meat. And as you'll see in this photo that I took of a broiler chicken in India, their problem is less that they're in cages - they're normally not in cages - and more the way that they've been bred in the first place, that they have been bred to suffer. There have been studies done on broiler chickens with leg problems, which is a common ailment amongst chickens, in which they've been offered feed laced with pain relief or feed laced without pain relief, and chickens who don't have these leg problems, who don't have these genetics, show no preference between the two. But the chickens who do have these leg problems, the chickens like this one here, that have been bred to grow too large, too fast, choose the pain relief laced feed, suggesting to us that these birds are in chronic pain. And when we're talking about 16 billion alive at any point in time, about 60 billion a year, given the short lifespan, that's a huge amount of potential&nbsp;suffering.</p><p>So what can we do to alleviate it? Obviously one thing is to reduce the amount of chicken that people eat. And I'll talk a little bit about some of the efforts in China on that later on. The other thing we can do is to reduce the suffering of each chicken, and so advocates have been working in the US over the last two years to secure five asks of&nbsp;companies.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1VCtSMcsIMeaaI48qm2CiE/35a50f27cee2b3f7065585c1ec69b9ea/Lewis_7.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1VCtSMcsIMeaaI48qm2CiE/35a50f27cee2b3f7065585c1ec69b9ea/Lewis_7.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1VCtSMcsIMeaaI48qm2CiE/35a50f27cee2b3f7065585c1ec69b9ea/Lewis_7.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1VCtSMcsIMeaaI48qm2CiE/35a50f27cee2b3f7065585c1ec69b9ea/Lewis_7.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1VCtSMcsIMeaaI48qm2CiE/35a50f27cee2b3f7065585c1ec69b9ea/Lewis_7.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1VCtSMcsIMeaaI48qm2CiE/35a50f27cee2b3f7065585c1ec69b9ea/Lewis_7.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1VCtSMcsIMeaaI48qm2CiE/35a50f27cee2b3f7065585c1ec69b9ea/Lewis_7.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>The first is to change the breed, to move away from these breeds of birds that are in constant pain. The second is to reduce the overcrowding in chicken barns. The third is to improve living conditions, in particular litter, lighting and enrichment. The fourth is to move to a less cruel method of slaughter. And the fifth to ensure the auditing of those pledges. There's already been significant progress to date: Burger King, Subway, major food service companies in the US have committed to these&nbsp;pledges.</p><p>And advocates are right now engaged in the toughest fight of all: the fight to get McDonald's to give up this incredibly cruel system of raising chickens. McDonald's accounts for about three to four percent of the chicken purchased in the US every year. So the decisions they make will have a huge impact directly on chickens, about 270 million chickens a year in their supply chain. But they will also have huge knock-on effects, so it's critical that advocates win this campaign to ensure better conditions for chickens in the US, and I think likely, too, in the future around the&nbsp;world.</p><h2>The Plight of&nbsp;Fish</h2><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5msA3sPsisGMu82mk4kYaW/b8e71952092fa9c8d61a160d4f317ac0/Lewis_8.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5msA3sPsisGMu82mk4kYaW/b8e71952092fa9c8d61a160d4f317ac0/Lewis_8.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5msA3sPsisGMu82mk4kYaW/b8e71952092fa9c8d61a160d4f317ac0/Lewis_8.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5msA3sPsisGMu82mk4kYaW/b8e71952092fa9c8d61a160d4f317ac0/Lewis_8.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5msA3sPsisGMu82mk4kYaW/b8e71952092fa9c8d61a160d4f317ac0/Lewis_8.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5msA3sPsisGMu82mk4kYaW/b8e71952092fa9c8d61a160d4f317ac0/Lewis_8.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5msA3sPsisGMu82mk4kYaW/b8e71952092fa9c8d61a160d4f317ac0/Lewis_8.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>This brings us to the second issue, the only group of animals, or vertebrate animals, that's larger than chickens on farms. And that's farmed fish. So this graph shows the increase in the number of farmed fish, individual farmed fish, over time globally. The best estimate now is that at any point in time, there's between 75 billion and 140 billion farmed fish, confined in fish farms globally. The estimate is that there may be another 1 to 2 trillion wild caught fish who are slaughtered globally. Most of them are very small fish.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4stxR463RYwGwOM8iMgOAk/dd495192edfbc08c669d4f4a6cca4a76/Lewis_9.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4stxR463RYwGwOM8iMgOAk/dd495192edfbc08c669d4f4a6cca4a76/Lewis_9.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4stxR463RYwGwOM8iMgOAk/dd495192edfbc08c669d4f4a6cca4a76/Lewis_9.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4stxR463RYwGwOM8iMgOAk/dd495192edfbc08c669d4f4a6cca4a76/Lewis_9.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4stxR463RYwGwOM8iMgOAk/dd495192edfbc08c669d4f4a6cca4a76/Lewis_9.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4stxR463RYwGwOM8iMgOAk/dd495192edfbc08c669d4f4a6cca4a76/Lewis_9.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4stxR463RYwGwOM8iMgOAk/dd495192edfbc08c669d4f4a6cca4a76/Lewis_9.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>This graph doesn't quite represent that. This graph shows more the trend line. This is in terms of tonnage rather than in terms of individuals because we don't have good individual data for wild caught fish. But what you can see is the trend over time is one in which wild caught fish is not increasing, while farmed fish is increasing rapidly. So something that's appealing about focusing on farmed fish is not just that they're more directly under our control, and that there's a greater lifespan of chronic suffering to affect, but also the fact that this is a trend line hitting in a very bad direction. So I want to tell you just a little bit about visiting a fish farm in India last year.

So these fish were hauled out of the water. Many of them were crushed to death underneath each other. Some of the other ones were live disemboweled, and the ones that weren't suffocated over the course of several hours. So we followed some of these fish to a live market, where they were still alive hours after they had been&nbsp;caught.</p><p>And I think the thing which is most striking with this particular welfare issue is how simply it could be solved. So, technology already exists to stun fish. Electrical stunning technology is relatively cheap. Some European companies like Tesco already require this throughout their supply chain and yet we see that over 90 percent of the fish globally are not stunned prior to slaughter. So in addition, of course, to wanting to reduce the number of fish, there are some really simple things that with a bit of pressure, could reduce a huge amount of chronic suffering, over 100 billion farmed fish a year, potentially over a trillion wild caught fish a year, if we could get stunning technology in&nbsp;place.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3Ob8UrsEAgGCmIIewQGSM0/164be7ec38801e4ac9cb81b740d8e581/Lewis_12.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3Ob8UrsEAgGCmIIewQGSM0/164be7ec38801e4ac9cb81b740d8e581/Lewis_12.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3Ob8UrsEAgGCmIIewQGSM0/164be7ec38801e4ac9cb81b740d8e581/Lewis_12.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3Ob8UrsEAgGCmIIewQGSM0/164be7ec38801e4ac9cb81b740d8e581/Lewis_12.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3Ob8UrsEAgGCmIIewQGSM0/164be7ec38801e4ac9cb81b740d8e581/Lewis_12.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3Ob8UrsEAgGCmIIewQGSM0/164be7ec38801e4ac9cb81b740d8e581/Lewis_12.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3Ob8UrsEAgGCmIIewQGSM0/164be7ec38801e4ac9cb81b740d8e581/Lewis_12.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>The other positive trend on fish recently is the attention that the issue has gotten from the media.

And this is not a case of China exporting to the world for the most part, though there's a little bit of that. This is primarily for domestic consumption, and so if you care about the plight of animals on farms, you have to care about China and the trajectory of this issue in China. And I think there are a number of hopeful signs on&nbsp;that.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5A8wjVG7EQeqO8wMkSIUYY/77337bd8f2c902e3a29406a33df8e3c2/Lewis_14.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5A8wjVG7EQeqO8wMkSIUYY/77337bd8f2c902e3a29406a33df8e3c2/Lewis_14.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5A8wjVG7EQeqO8wMkSIUYY/77337bd8f2c902e3a29406a33df8e3c2/Lewis_14.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5A8wjVG7EQeqO8wMkSIUYY/77337bd8f2c902e3a29406a33df8e3c2/Lewis_14.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5A8wjVG7EQeqO8wMkSIUYY/77337bd8f2c902e3a29406a33df8e3c2/Lewis_14.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5A8wjVG7EQeqO8wMkSIUYY/77337bd8f2c902e3a29406a33df8e3c2/Lewis_14.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/5A8wjVG7EQeqO8wMkSIUYY/77337bd8f2c902e3a29406a33df8e3c2/Lewis_14.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>It may be a little hard to read what this says, but this was a survey done at the end of last year, of 2,000 Chinese consumers. They were asked how often they eat each of these groups. So in blue means they eat this group of food every day and red means a few times a week, green once a week, purple less than once a week and the light blue means they never eat this food. And what you see is, despite some of the headlines you may have seen, there's very little vegetarianism or veganism in China. There were very few people, less than one percent, who said that they never ate pork or never ate other animal products. However, what you also see alongside this, is that the majority of Chinese consumers in this survey said that they don't eat meat every day. In fact, not only do they not eat pork, they don't eat chicken or other types of meat every day, and it's far more common to eat it on a weekly&nbsp;basis.</p><p>And you also see that Chinese consumers eat plant protein on a daily basis. So things like mock meats, things like legumes, things like nuts often mixed together with meat dishes. So for instance, a tofu and pork dish is regularly part of the diet. And I think this provides a basis to work from that we don't have in the US, because these alternatives are already readily available, and they're already accepted as part of the Chinese&nbsp;diet.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3YdNr1TQ8wEOGUQMEaOqIW/676343a2135ac4b47eef065ff87690e6/Lewis_15.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3YdNr1TQ8wEOGUQMEaOqIW/676343a2135ac4b47eef065ff87690e6/Lewis_15.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3YdNr1TQ8wEOGUQMEaOqIW/676343a2135ac4b47eef065ff87690e6/Lewis_15.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3YdNr1TQ8wEOGUQMEaOqIW/676343a2135ac4b47eef065ff87690e6/Lewis_15.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3YdNr1TQ8wEOGUQMEaOqIW/676343a2135ac4b47eef065ff87690e6/Lewis_15.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3YdNr1TQ8wEOGUQMEaOqIW/676343a2135ac4b47eef065ff87690e6/Lewis_15.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3YdNr1TQ8wEOGUQMEaOqIW/676343a2135ac4b47eef065ff87690e6/Lewis_15.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Here's a graph that shows similar data in another format. So what you see here is in green, plant protein, and in red, animal protein. You can see in the US, we're incredibly dependent on animal protein. About two thirds of our daily protein average intake is coming from animal-based protein. When you look at the rest of the world, that's just far less the case. So the average Chinese person and the average Indian is getting more plant-based protein now than the average American. And what you see particularly when you look at somewhere like India, like the rest of Asia and China, is that the animal protein segment is not as big as it's gotten in the US. It seems like there's the potential to shrink that without people going below the level of daily protein required. So although we obviously want to increase the percentage of plant protein, there's also the potential to simply reduce the percent of animal&nbsp;protein.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/21SKlmwSwUw0GwOm8Kmo4w/6d7a5eaa4957ad7c01ecdcfcb7501feb/Lewis_16.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/21SKlmwSwUw0GwOm8Kmo4w/6d7a5eaa4957ad7c01ecdcfcb7501feb/Lewis_16.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/21SKlmwSwUw0GwOm8Kmo4w/6d7a5eaa4957ad7c01ecdcfcb7501feb/Lewis_16.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/21SKlmwSwUw0GwOm8Kmo4w/6d7a5eaa4957ad7c01ecdcfcb7501feb/Lewis_16.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/21SKlmwSwUw0GwOm8Kmo4w/6d7a5eaa4957ad7c01ecdcfcb7501feb/Lewis_16.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/21SKlmwSwUw0GwOm8Kmo4w/6d7a5eaa4957ad7c01ecdcfcb7501feb/Lewis_16.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/21SKlmwSwUw0GwOm8Kmo4w/6d7a5eaa4957ad7c01ecdcfcb7501feb/Lewis_16.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>And here's two more causes for optimism. So what you see on the first side was, again the same survey, reported changes in consumption, so people everywhere always say they're eating more fruits and vegetables and you can take that with a grain of salt. But the thing that I think is interesting here is that poultry and pork consumption are reported to be down. We're actually seeing that showing up in the national statistics. Now at the same time, fish and seafood consumption is up. So it's not clear that this is totally worked out net positive, but I think there's a positive trend there. I think there's also a positive trend in the increase in plant protein consumption, which sort of goes against the narrative that China is moving away from plant protein and toward animal protein. The other thing you see is a receptiveness to clean meat, which seems to be greater than the receptiveness that we've seen to clean meat - meat grown from cells - in the US. And so if you think that that's likely to be in the future, down the line, it suggests China may be a good market for&nbsp;that.</p><p>The one other cause for optimism that I want to highlight is the change within the Chinese government. So something you've seen on a number of social issues in China, for instance, on environmentalism, is that the Chinese government was traditionally silent on the matter, but that once Chinese government officials started talking about it, they legitimized the issue and were able to achieve policy changes far faster than we've achieved them in the US. And my hope is that this is the start of a trend like&nbsp;that.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3NmhJAgZnygyi64SCMsmk8/18f5de03afc34798cac80d7128c1199b/Lewis_17.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3NmhJAgZnygyi64SCMsmk8/18f5de03afc34798cac80d7128c1199b/Lewis_17.jpg?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3NmhJAgZnygyi64SCMsmk8/18f5de03afc34798cac80d7128c1199b/Lewis_17.jpg?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3NmhJAgZnygyi64SCMsmk8/18f5de03afc34798cac80d7128c1199b/Lewis_17.jpg?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3NmhJAgZnygyi64SCMsmk8/18f5de03afc34798cac80d7128c1199b/Lewis_17.jpg?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3NmhJAgZnygyi64SCMsmk8/18f5de03afc34798cac80d7128c1199b/Lewis_17.jpg?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3NmhJAgZnygyi64SCMsmk8/18f5de03afc34798cac80d7128c1199b/Lewis_17.jpg?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>So what we saw last year was what is to my knowledge, the first time Chinese government official has spoken in favor of animal welfare, and indeed the first time that a Chinese government official has called for animal welfare legislation, which China doesn't yet have. And in fact also in the same speech, called for a set of regulations and technical standards. And so my hope is we'll start to see the dividends of&nbsp;that.</p><h1>Q&amp;A</h1><p><strong>Question:</strong> Meat consumption is on the rise. As the world gets wealthier, we see this, especially as GDP increases in the developing world. How can we go about thinking about preventing norms from being established before meat consumption becomes&nbsp;normalized?</p><p><strong>Lewis:</strong> Yeah, this is really interesting. So, there are certainly efforts underway in parts of the world, for instance, in developing parts of Asia, to encourage vegetarianism. But I think that it's often hard in a developing nation context to tell people that they shouldn't be able to eat something. And so although I think people often look at this as the low hanging fruit to stop people from eating meat before they start eating it, I tend to be a little more skeptical of that. I tend to think that it's, it's perhaps going to be easier to get people in a place where they already have all the necessities of life, and they can start to think more about these concerns. So I mean, one cause for optimism is that you hear a constant narrative about India eating more meat. The statistics don't really back that up. So, the percentage of Indians who are vegetarian is the same as it was 10 years ago. The amount of red meat being consumed in India is down from 10 years ago. The amount of poultry being consumed is only slightly up. The amount of fish and seafood is only slightly up. So I think this narrative can be overblown a bit, but I also think that, well, there's certainly some hope along those lines. I think we have to be delicate because of the&nbsp;situation.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> You mentioned that it seems like a really good sign that there's a Chinese official backing animal welfare legislation, but to someone who lives in the US, making progress here may seem pretty impervious. Is there something that they could do, particularly in the China animal welfare&nbsp;context?</p><p><strong>Lewis:</strong> Yeah, well, I think for people who are themselves Chinese or Chinese American, I think there is more you can do, so I would certainly encourage anyone who fits in that category and is interested in animal welfare to come speak to me or to Brian Tse, who's also at this conference, and perhaps maybe here in the audience. I think that if you're not Chinese, it's likely that there are things you can do for international organizations. Now, whether that's your comparative advantage, I don't know. I think it probably depends a bit, but there are international groups that are working at the invitation of the Chinese government. So on the animal welfare side, groups like Compassion World Farming, World Animal Protection, and on the meat reduction side groups like Wild Aid and&nbsp;GOBlue.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> At the beginning of the talk, you mentioned specific campaigns like the campaign for McDonald's that seems to be pushing the frontier in the right direction, but are there campaigns that you would like to see and would throw funding behind if only they existed? And if so, what are&nbsp;these?</p><p><strong>Lewis:</strong> Yeah, so there are certainly a lot of campaigns that we'd love to see in the long term. I think that in the short term there's really a lot of value to focus. And so although for instance, I'd love to see campaigns focused on fish, I'd love to see campaigns pushing for things beyond immediate cage free on hens, campaigns focused on other species, I think there's been a lot of value to focusing on one issue at a time. And so I wouldn't encourage US advocates to take on other issues right now necessarily. And I think internationally it really depends on where things are at. I think in Europe because things are furthest along, there's the most scope to advance sort of new issues like fish, like perhaps mutilations of pigs, and other of the new welfare issues.&nbsp;Yeah.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> For lots of cause areas that EAs focus on, they are really looking for an evidence basis, and it seems pretty hard to get this when you're working with an n of five, a really small number of policy advocacy campaigns. What makes you think that a campaign may be something that's worth putting money and support&nbsp;behind?</p><p><strong>Lewis:</strong> Sure. Well, I think what the corporate campaigns, we have much more than an n of five. I mean we have an n of 530 in terms of corporate victories. So, and you know, obviously more in terms of corporate\u2026 not victories yet. So I think on policy it's certainly the case that it has to be more speculative, where you're working with the government, where they perhaps haven't passed something yet. Although you can look to examples like the European Union, like India where there have been policy gains. And then certainly as far as people are interested in things like individual dietary advocacy, there have been more studies, so there have been more attempts at RCTs, so I think there's a lot more scope for RCTs in that space in terms of looking at what messaging is effective in getting people to care about these issues, and you're getting them to reduce their meat&nbsp;consumption.</p><p><strong>Question:</strong> Cool. And, final question, is there progress and promise in China on the corporate pressure&nbsp;side?</p><p><strong>Lewis:</strong> Not so much on the corporate pressure side. I think pressure would probably be unwise in the Chinese context, but I think we are starting to see some real progress in terms of corporate outreach, and sort of self-initiated corporate reforms. There are also various, more subtle pressures at play there. I think for instance, companies that want to export into the European market, companies that want to be seen as adopting world class standards. And so you are seeing a number of major Chinese producers now committing to get rid of gestation crates, which is something the US pork industry still refuses to do. And in some cases even to get rid of farrowing crates, which is something that the US pork industry has said is impossible. So I think we're actually seeing a lot of progress, amongst particular parts of the industry in China, less from pressure campaigns and more from sort of targeted outreach and from technical work helping these&nbsp;companies.</p>", "user": {"username": "The Centre for Effective Altruism"}}, {"_id": "Nrq9v3Kii7EmAhFk2", "title": "Jade Leung and Seth Baum: The role of existing institutions in AI strategy", "postedAt": "2018-06-08T07:15:00.000Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pgiwvmY3brg&amp;list=PLwp9xeoX5p8P3cDQwlyN7qsFhC9Ms4L5W&amp;index=3\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/pgiwvmY3brg\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><hr><p><i>AI is very likely to make a huge impact on our world, especially as it grows more powerful than it is today.

Then we've got two moots which we have just then decided were the two moots that we're going to talk about. We'll chuck them up on the board and we'll spend about half a session talking about one and then half a session talking about the other. This is a session where we'd both love for you guys to toss us your questions right throughout it basically so, yes, get ready to have your questions ready and we'll open it up pretty much soon after the&nbsp;intro.</p><p>Briefly intro to myself. I currently am based in the Future of Humanity Institute, and the work that I do specifically looks at the relationships between large multi-national technology firms and governments, specifically National Security and Defense components of governments in the US and China. And the questions that I ask are about how these actors should relate to each other, cooperate, coordinate, to steer us towards a future, or set of futures, that are more safe and beneficial than not, with transformative AI. My background is in engineering, I am masquerading as international relations person, but I'm not really that. I do a fair amount in the global governance space, in the IR space largely. That's&nbsp;me.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Cool. I'm Seth Baum, I was introduced with the Global Catastrophic Risk Institute, and as a think tank we try to sit in that classic think tank space of working at the intersection of, among other things, the world of scholarship and the world of policy. We spend a lot of time talking with people in the policy worlds, especially down in DC. For me, it's down in DC, I live in New York. I guess from here it would be over in DC. Is that what you say? You don't live&nbsp;here.</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> Sure.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Over in DC. And talking with people in policy. I work across a number of different policy areas, do a lot on nuclear weapons, little bit on biosecurity, and then also on AI, and especially within the last year or two there have been some more robust policy conversations about AI. The policy world has just started to take an interest in this topic and is starting to do some interesting things that have fallen on our radar, and so we'll be saying more about that. Do you want&nbsp;to?</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> Yeah, sure.</p><p>So the two institutions that we're going to chat about, is firstly the National Security and Defense. We might focus on the US National Security and Defense, and have a bit of a chat about what makes sense to engage them on in the space of our strategy, and how we should be thinking about their role in this space. That's the first moot. The second will turn to more international institutions, the kind of multilateral groups, e.g. the UN but not strictly so, and what role they could play in the space of AI strategy as well. We'll kind of go half and half&nbsp;there.</p><p>Just so I have a bit of a litmus test for who's in the audience, if I say AI strategy, who does that mean anything to? Ah, awesome. Okay, cool. Maybe we'll just start with getting Seth's quick perspective on this question. So the moot here is, this house believes that in the space of AI strategy, we should be actively engaging with National Security and Defense components of the US government. Do you want to speak quickly to what your quick take on that&nbsp;is?</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Sure. So an interesting question here is engaging with, say the US government especially on the national security side, is this a good thing or a bad thing? I feel like opinions vary on this, maybe even within this room opinions vary on whether having these conversations is a good thing or a bad thing. The argument against it that I hear is essentially, you might tell them AI could take over the world and kill everyone, and they might hear, AI could take over the world, hear that and then go on to do harmful&nbsp;things.</p><p>I personally tend to be more skeptical of that sort of argument. The main reason for that is that the people who are in the government and working on AI, they've already heard this idea before. It's been headline news for a number of years now, some people from our communities including your organization caused some of those&nbsp;headlines.</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> I feel like you're asking me to apologize for them, and I'm not going&nbsp;to.</p><p><i>Seth</i>: If one is concerned about the awareness of various people in government about runaway AI, you could ask questions like, was the publication of the Superintelligence book a good thing or a bad thing? You could maybe there make a case in either&nbsp;direction-</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> Could we do a quick poll actually? I'd be curious. Who thinks the publication of Superintelligence was on net, a net positive thing? On net, a negative thing? Hell&nbsp;yeah.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Doesn't mean that that's actually&nbsp;true.</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> Fair enough.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Just to be clear, I'm not arguing that it was a net negative, but the point is that the idea is out, and the people who work on AI, sure, they're mostly working on a narrow near term AI, but they've heard the idea before. They don't need us to put the thought into their heads. Now of course we could be kind of strengthening that thought within their heads, and that can matter, but at the same time when I interact with them, I actually tend to not be talking about superintelligence, general intelligence, that stuff anyway. Though more for a different reason, and that's because while they have heard of the idea, they're pretty skeptical about it. Either because they think it probably wouldn't happen or because if it would happen it would be too far in the future for them to worry about. A lot of people in policy have much more near term time horizons that they have to work with. They have enough on their plate already, nobody's asking them to worry about this, so they're just going to focus on the stuff that they actually need to worry about, which includes the AI that already exists and is in the process of coming&nbsp;online.</p><p>What I've found is then because they're pretty dismissive of it, I feel like if I talk about it they might just be dismissive of what I have to say, and that's not productive. Versus instead if the message is we should be careful about AI that acts unpredictably and causes unintended harms, that's not really about superintelligence. That same message applies to the AI that exists already: self driving cars, autonomous weapons. You don't want autonomous weapons causing unintended harm, and that's a message that people are very receptive to. By emphasizing that sort of message we can strengthen that type of thinking within policy worlds. That's for the most part the message that I've typically gone with, including in the National Security&nbsp;communities.</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> Cool. I've got a ton of questions for you, but maybe to quickly interject my version of that. I tend to agree with a couple of things that Seth said, and then disagree with a couple specific&nbsp;things.</p><p>I think generally the description of my perspective on this is that there's a very limited amount of useful engagement with National Security today, and I think the amount of potential to do wrong via engaging with them is large, and sufficiently large that we should be incredibly cautious about the manner in which we engage. That is a different thing to saying that we shouldn't engage with them at all, and I'll nuance that a little bit. I think, maybe to illustrate, I think the priors or assumptions that people hold when they're taking a stance on whether you should engage with National Security or not, is people I think disagree on maybe three axes. I said three because people always say three, I'm not entirely sure what the three are but we'll see how this&nbsp;goes.</p><p>So I think the first is people disagree on the competence of National Security to pursue the technology themselves, or at least to do something harmful with said information about capabilities of the technology. I think some people hold the extreme view that they're kind of useless and there's nothing that they can do in-house that is going to cause technology to be more unsafe than not, which is the thing that you're trying to deter. On the other hand, some people believe that NatSec at least have the ability to acquire control of this technology, or can develop it in-house sufficiently so, that an understanding of significant capabilities of AI would lead them to want to pursue it, and they can pursue it with competence,&nbsp;basically.</p><p>I think that kind of competence thing is one thing that people disagree on, and I would tend to land on them being more competent than people think. Even if that's not the case, I think it's always worth being conservative in that sense&nbsp;anyways.</p><p>So that's the first axis. Second axis I think is about whether they have a predisposition, or whether they have the ability to absorb this kind of risk narrative effectively, or whether that's just so orthogonal to the culture of NatSec that it's not going to be received in a nuanced enough way and they're always going to interpret whatever information with a predisposition to want to pursue unilateral military advantage, regardless of what you're saying to them. Some people on one end would hold that they are reasonable people with a broad open mind, and plausibly could absorb this kind of long-term risk narrative. Some other people would hold that information that is received by them will tend to just be received with the lens of how can we use this to secure a national strategic&nbsp;advantage.</p><p>I would tend to land on us having no precedent for the former, and having a lot more precedent for the latter. I think I'd like to believe that folks at DOD and NatSec can absorb, or can come around more to the long term risk narrative, but I don't think we've seen any precedent enough for that to place credence on that side of the spectrum. That's kind of where I sit on that second&nbsp;axis.</p><p>I said I had a third, I'm not entirely sure what the third is, so let's just leave it at&nbsp;two.</p><p>I think that probably describes the reasons why I hold that I think engaging with NatSec can be plausibly useful, but for every kind of one useful case, I can see many more reasons why engaging with them could plausibly be a bad idea, at least at this stage. So I'd encourage a lot more caution than I think Seth&nbsp;would.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> That's interesting. I'm not sure how much caution\u2026 I would agree, first of all I would agree, caution is warranted. This is one reason why a lot of my initial engagement is oriented towards generically safe messages like, \"avoid harmful unintended consequences.\" I feel like there are limits to how much trouble you can get in spreading messages like that. It's a message that they will understand pretty uniformly, it's just an easy concept people get that. They might or might not do much with it, but it's at least probably not going to prompt them to work in the wrong&nbsp;directions.</p><p>As far as their capability and also their tendency to take up the risk narrative, it's going to vary from person to person. We should not make the mistake of treating National Security communities even within one country as being some monolithic entity. There are people of widely varying technical capacity, widely varying philosophical understanding, ideological tendencies, interest in having these sorts of conversations in the first place, and so&nbsp;on.</p><p>A lot of the work that I think is important is meeting some people, and seeing what the personalities are like, seeing where the conversations are especially productive. We don't have to walk in and start trumpeting all sorts of precise technical messages right away. It's important to know the audience. A lot of it's just about getting to know people, building relationships. Relationships are really important with these sorts of things, especially if one is interested in a more deeper and ongoing involvement in it. These are communities. These are professional communities and it's important to get to know them, even informally, that's going to help. So I would say&nbsp;that.</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> I tend to agree with that sentiment in particular about building a relationship and getting trust within this community can take a fair amount of time. And so if there's any sort of given strategic scenario in which it's important to have that relationship built, then it could make sense to start some paving blocks&nbsp;there.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> It is an investment. It is an investment in time. It's a trade off,&nbsp;right?</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> What's an example of a productive engagement you can think of having now? Say if I like put you in a room full of NatSec people, what would the most productive version of that engagement look like&nbsp;today?</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> An area that I have been doing a little bit of work on, probably will continue to do more, is on the intersection of artificial intelligence and nuclear weapons. This is in part because I happen to have also a background on nuclear weapons, a scenario where I have a track record, a bit of a reputation, and I know the lingo, know some of the people, can do that. AI does intersect with nuclear weapons in a few different ways. There is AI built into some of the vehicles that deliver the nuclear weapon from point A to point B, though maybe not as much as you might think. There's also AI that can get tied into issues of the cybersecurity of the command and control Systems, essentially the computer systems that tie the whole nuclear enterprise together, and maybe one or two other things. The National Security communities, they're interested in this stuff. Anything that could change the balance of nuclear power, they are acutely interested in, and you can have a conversation that is fairly normal from their perspective about it, while introducing certain concepts in&nbsp;AI.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> So that's one area that I come in. The other thing I like about the nuclear weapons is the conversation there is predisposed to think in low frequency, high severity risk terms. That's really a hallmark of the nuclear weapons conversation. That has other advantages for the sorts of values that we might want to push for. It's not the only way to do it, but if you were to put me in a room, that's likely to be the conversation I would&nbsp;have.</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> So if you were to link that outcome to a mitigation of risk as an end goal, how does them understanding concepts better in AI translate into a mitigation of risk, broadly speaking? Assuming that's the end goal that you wanted to aim&nbsp;for.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> One of the core issues with AI is this question of predictability and unintended consequences. You definitely do not want unpredictable AI managing your nuclear weapons. That is an easy sell. There is hyper-caution about nuclear weapons, and in fact if you look at the US procurement plans for new airplanes to deliver nuclear weapons, the new stealth bomber that is currently being developed, will have an option to be uninhabited, to fly itself. I think it might be remote controlled. The expectation is that it will not fly uninhabited on nuclear missions. That they want a human on board when there is also a nuclear weapon there, just in case something goes wrong. Even if the system is otherwise pretty reliable, that's just their\u2026 That's how they would look at this, and I think that's useful. So here we have this idea that AI might not do what we want it to, that's a good starting&nbsp;point.</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> Sure, cool. Let's toss it out to the audience for a couple of questions. We've got like 10 minutes to deal with NatSec and then we're going to move on into multilaterals. Yeah, go for&nbsp;it.</p><p>I didn't realize you were literally one behind the other. Maybe you first and then we'll go that&nbsp;way.</p><p><strong>Audience Member:</strong> I was just in Washington, DC for grad school and had a number of friends who were working for think tanks that advise the military on technical issues like cybersecurity, or biosecurity, and I definitely felt like I had this sense of maybe the people in charge were pretty narrow-minded, but that there's this large non-homogenous group of people, some of whom were going to be very thoughtful and open-minded and some of whom weren't. And that there's definitely places where the message could fall on the right ears, and maybe something useful done about it, but it would be really hard to get it into the right ears without getting it into the wrong ears. I was wondering if you guys have any feelings about, is there a risk to giving this message or to giving a message to the wrong people? Or is that like very little risk, and it will just go in one ear and out the other if it goes to the wrong person? I feel like you could think about that either&nbsp;way.</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> Yeah, I'm curious to hear more about your experience actually, and whether there was a tendency for certain groups, or types of people to be the right ears versus the wrong ears. If you've got any particular trends that popped out to you, I'd love to hear that now or later or&nbsp;whenever.</p><p>But as a quick response, I think there's a couple of things to break down there. One is, what information are you actually talking about, what classifies as bad information to give versus&nbsp;good.</p><p>Two, is whether you have the ability to nuance the way that it's received, or whether it goes and is received in some way, and the action occurs without your control. I think, in terms of good information, that I would be positive about good ears receiving, and a bit meh about more belligerent ears received it, they couldn't actually do anything useful with the information&nbsp;anyway.</p><p>I think anything that nuances the technicality of what the technology does and doesn't do, generally is a good thing. I think also the element of introducing that risk narrative, if it falls on good ears, it can go good ways, if it falls on bad ears, they're just going to ignore it&nbsp;anyway.</p><p>You can't actually do anything actively bad with information about there being a risk, that maybe you don't have a predisposition to care about anyway. I'd say that's good information. I think the ability for you to pick the right ears for it to be received by, I'm skeptical about&nbsp;that.</p><p>I'm skeptical about the ability for you translate reliably up the hierarchy where it lands in a decision maker's hands, and actually translates into action that's useful. That would be my initial response to that, is that even if it exists and it's a more heterogeneous space than what would assume, I wouldn't trust that we have the ability to read into that well, is my&nbsp;response.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> I would say I find it really difficult to generalize on this. In that, each point of information that we might introduce to a conversation is different. Each group that we would be interacting with can be different, and different in important ways. I feel, if we are actually in possession of some message that really is that sensitive then, to the extent that you can, do your homework on who it is that you're talking to, what the chain of command, the chain of conversation looks&nbsp;like.</p><p>If you're really worried, having people who you have a closer relationship with, where there may be at least some degree of trust, although, who knows what happens when you tell somebody something? Can you really trust me with what you say? Right? You don't know who else I'm talking to, right? So on for anyone else. At the end of the day, when decisions need to be made, I would want to look at the whole suite of factors, this goes for a lot of what we do, not just the transmission of sensitive&nbsp;information.</p><p>A lot of this really is fairly context specific and can come down to any number of things that may be seemingly unrelated to the thing that we think that we are talking about. Questions of bureaucratic procedure that get into all sorts of arcane minute details could end up actually being really decisive factors for some of these&nbsp;decisions.</p><p>It's good for us to be familiar, and have ways of understanding how it all works, that we can make these decisions intelligently. That's what I would&nbsp;say.</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> Cool.</p><p><strong>Audience Member:</strong> All right, so from what I understand, a lot of people are new to this space. What sort of skills do you think would be good for people to learn? What sort of areas, like topics, should people delve into to prove themselves in AI strategy? What sort of thinking is useful for this&nbsp;space?</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> That's a good question. Should I&nbsp;start?</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Okay. That's a good question. I feel for those who really want to have a strong focus on this, it helps to do a fairly deep dive into the worlds that you would be interacting&nbsp;with.</p><p>I can say from my own experience, I've gotten a lot of mileage out of fairly deep dives into a lot of details of international&nbsp;security.</p><p>I got to learn the distinction between a fighter plane and a bomber plane for example. The fighter plans are smaller and more agile, and maneuverable and the bombers are big sluggish beasts that carry heavy payloads and it's the latter that have the nuclear weapons, it's the former that benefit from more automation and a faster more powerful AI, because they're doing these really sophisticated aerial procedures, and fighting other fighter planes and that's\u2026 The more AI you can pack into that, the more likely you are to win, versus the bomber planes it just doesn't matter, they're slow and they're not doing anything that sophisticated in that&nbsp;regard.</p><p>That's just one little example of the sort of subtle detail that comes from a deeper dive into the topic that, in conversations, can actually be quite useful, you're not caught off guard, you can talk the lingo, you know what they're saying, you can frame your points in ways that they&nbsp;understand.</p><p>Along the way you also learn who is doing what, and get in that background. I would say it helps to be in direct contact with these communities. Like myself, I live in New York, I don't live in Washington, but I'm in Washington with some regularity attending various events, just having casual conversations with people, maybe doing certain projects and activities, and that has been helpful for positioning myself to contribute in a way that, if I want to, I can blend&nbsp;in.</p><p>They can think of me as one of them. I am one of them, and that's fine. That's normal. While also being here, and being able to participate in these conversations. So that's what I would recommend, is really do what you can to learn how these communities think and work and be able to relate to them on their&nbsp;level.</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> Addition to that would be, try to work on being more sensible, is the main thing I would say. It's one of those things where, a shout out to CFAR for example, those kind of methodologies\u2026 basically, I think the people that I think are doing the best work in this space, are the people who have the ability to A. Absorb a bunch of information really quickly, B. Figure out what is decision relevant quickly, and C. Cut through all the bullshit that is not decision relevant but that people talk about a&nbsp;lot.</p><p>I think those three things will lead you towards asking really good questions, and asking them in a sensible way, and coming to hypotheses and answers relatively quickly, and then knowing what to do with&nbsp;them.</p><p>Sorry, that's not a very specific answer, just work on being good at thinking, and figure out ways to train your mind to pick up decision relevant&nbsp;questions.</p><p><strong>Audience Member:</strong> CFAR would be a good be a good organization for that, is that what you're&nbsp;saying?</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> CFAR would be epic, yeah. We've got a couple people from CFAR in the audience, I think. Do you want to put your hand up? If you're here. Nice. So, have a chat to them about how to get&nbsp;involved.</p><p>The other thing I'd say, is there is a ton of room for different types of skills, and figuring out where your comparative advantage is, is a useful&nbsp;thing.</p><p>I am not a white male, so I have a less comparative advantage in politics, I'm not a US citizen, can't do USG stuff, those are facts about me that I know will lead me toward certain areas in this&nbsp;space.</p><p>I am an entrepreneur by background, that leads me to have certain skills that maybe other people marginally don't have. Think about what you enjoy, what you're good at, and think about the whole pipeline of you doing useful stuff, which starts probably at fundamentally researching things, and ends at influencing decision makers/being a decision maker. Figure out where in that pipeline you are most likely to have a good&nbsp;idea.</p><p>Another shout out to 80k, who does a lot of good facilitation of thinking about what one's comparative advantage could be, and helps you identify those,&nbsp;too.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> You mentioned the white male thing, and yeah sure, that's a&nbsp;thing.</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> That was genuinely not a dig at you being a white&nbsp;male.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> No.</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> I promise. It's a dig at all of you for being white males. I just realized this is recorded, and this has gone so far downhill I just can't retract any of that. We're going to keep&nbsp;going.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> So, for example, if I was attending a national security meeting instead of this, I might have shaved. Right? Because, it's a room full of a lot of people who are ex-military, or even active military or come from more\u2026 much of the policy culture in DC is more conservative, they're wearing suits and ties. Is there a single suit and tie in this room? I don't see&nbsp;one.</p><p>It's pretty standard for most of the events there that I go to. Simple things like that can&nbsp;matter.</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> Yeah.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> You don't have to be a white male to succeed in that world. In fact, a lot of the national security community is actually pretty attentive to these sorts of things, tries to make sure that their speaking panels have at least one woman on them, for&nbsp;example.</p><p>There are a lot of very successful women in the national security space, very talented at it, and recognized as such. You don't have to look like me, minus the&nbsp;beard.</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> Nice. That's good to know. It's always useful having a token women's spot, actually. All right, one last question on NatSec, then we're going to move on.&nbsp;Yeah?</p><p><strong>Audience Member:</strong> What do you think about the idea of measurements of algorithmic and hardware progress, and the amount of money going into AI and those kinds of measurements becoming public, and then NatSec becoming aware&nbsp;of?</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> That's a really interesting&nbsp;question.</p><p>I'm generally very, pro-that happening. I think those efforts are particularly good for serving a number of different functions. One is, the process of generating those metrics is really useful for the research community, to understand what metrics we actually care about measuring versus not. B, the measurement of them systematically across a number of different systems is very useful for at least starting conversations about which threshold points we care about superseding, and what changes about your strategy if you supersede certain metrics particularly quicker than you expected&nbsp;to.</p><p>I'm generally pro-those things, in terms of\u2026 I guess the pragmatic question is whether you can stop the publication of them anyway, and I don't think you can. I would say that if you had the ability to censor them, it would still be a net positive to have that stuff published for the things that I just&nbsp;mentioned.</p><p>I would also plausibly say that NatSec would have the ability to gather that information anyway. Yeah. I don't necessarily also think it's bad for them to understand progress better, and for them to be on the same page as everyone else about, specifically as the same as the technical research community, about how these systems are progressing. I don't think that's a bad piece of information necessarily, sorry, that was a really handwoven answer,&nbsp;but\u2026</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> I feel like it is at least to an approximation reasonable to assume that if there's a piece of information and the US intelligence community would like that information, they will get&nbsp;it.</p><p>Especially if it's a relatively straightforward piece of information like that, that's not behind crazy locked doors and things of that sort. If it's something that we can just have a conversation about here, and they want it, they will probably get that information. There may be exceptions, but I think that's a reasonable starting&nbsp;point.</p><p>But I feel like what's more important than that, is the question of like, the interpretation of the information, right? It's a lot of information, the question is what does it&nbsp;mean?</p><p>I feel like that's where we might want to think more carefully about how things are handled. Even then there's a lot of ideas out there, and our own ideas on any given topic are still just another voice in a much broader&nbsp;conversation.</p><p>We shouldn't overestimate our own influence on what goes on in the interpretation of intelligence within a large bureaucracy. If it's a question of, do we communicate openly where the audience is mostly say, ourselves, right, and this is for our coordination as a community, for&nbsp;example?</p><p>Where, sure, other communities may hear this, whether in the US or anywhere around the world, but to them we're just one of many voices, right? In a lot of cases it may be fair to simply hide in plain sight. In that, who are we from their perspective, versus who are we from our perspective? We're paying attention to ourselves, and getting a lot more value of&nbsp;it.</p><p>Again, you can take it on a case by case basis, but that's one way of looking at&nbsp;it.</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> Cool. We're going to segue into talking about international institutions, maybe just to frame this chat a little bit. Specifically the type of institutions that I think we want to talk about, are probably multi-lateral state-based&nbsp;institutions.</p><p>That being, the UN and the UN's various children, and those other bodies that are all governed by the system. That assumes a couple of things: one, that states are the main actors at the table that mean anything, and two, that there are meaningful international coordination activities. Institutions are composed of state representatives and various things. The question here is, are they useful to engage with? I guess that's like a yes or no&nbsp;question.</p><p>Then if you want it nuance it a bit more, what are they useful for versus what are they not? Does that sound like a&nbsp;reasonable\u2026</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Yes.</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> My quick hot take on that, then I'll pass it over to Seth. I'll caveat this by saying, well I'll validate my statement by saying that I've spent a lot of my academic life working in the global governance&nbsp;space.</p><p>That field is fundamentally very optimistic about these institutions, so if anything I had the training to predispose me to be optimistic about them, and I'm not. I'm pessimistic about how useful they are for a number of&nbsp;reasons.</p><p>I think A is to do with the state-centric approach, B is to do with precedent, about what they're useful for versus not, and C it's also the pace at which they&nbsp;move.</p><p>To run through each one of those in turn, I think the assumption that a lot these institutions held, and they were built to rely on these assumptions, that states the core actors who are needing to be&nbsp;coordinated.</p><p>They are assumed to have the authority and legitimacy, to move the things that need to move, in order for this coordination to do the thing you want it to do. That is a set of assumptions that I think used to hold better, but almost certainly doesn't hold now, and almost certainly doesn't hold in the case of&nbsp;AI.</p><p>Particularly so, actors that I think are neglected and aren't conceptualized reasonably in these international institutions, large firms, and also military and security folks, or that component of government, doesn't tend to be the component of government that's represented in these&nbsp;institutions.</p><p>Those two are probably the most important actors, and they aren't conceptualized as the most important actors in that space. That's one reason to be skeptical, that by design they aren't designed to be that&nbsp;useful.</p><p>I think two, in terms of historically what they've been useful for, I think UN institutions have been okay at doing non-setting, non-building, non-proliferation stuff, I think they've been okay at doing things like standard setting, and instituting these norms and translating them into standards that end up proliferating across industries. That is useful as a function. I'll say particularly so in the case of technologies, the standardization stuff is useful, so I'm more optimistic about bodies like the ISO, which stands for the International Standards something, standards thing. Organization, I guess. Does that seem plausible? That seems plausible. I'm optimistic about them more so than I am about like the UN General Council or whatever. But, in any case, I think that's kind of a limited set of functions, and it doesn't really cover a lot of the coordination cooperation that we want it to&nbsp;do.</p><p>And then third is that historically these institutions have been so freaking slow at doing anything, and that pace is not anywhere close to where it needs to be. The one version of this argument is like if that's the only way that you can achieve the coordination activities that you want, then maybe that's the best that you have, but I don't think that's the best that we have. I think there are quicker arrangements between actors directly, and between small clubs of actors specifically, that will just be quicker at achieving the coordination that we need to achieve. So I don't think we need to go to the effort of involving slow institutions to achieve the ends that we want to. So, that's kind of why I'm skeptical about the usefulness of these institutions at all, with the caveat of them being useful for standard setting&nbsp;potentially.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> I feel like people at those institutions might not disagree with what you just said. Okay, the standards thing, I think that's an important point. Also\u2026 so the UN. A lot of what the UN does operates on consensus across 200 countries. So yeah, that's not going to happen all that much. To the extent that it does happen, it's something that will often build slowly over time. There may be some exceptions like astronomers find an asteroid heading towards Earth, we need to do something now. Okay, yeah, you could probably get a consensus on that. And even then, who knows? You'd like to think, but\u2026 and that's a relatively straightforward one, because there's no bad guys. With AI, there's bad guys. There's benefits of AI that would be lost if certain types of AI that couldn't be pursued, and it plays out differently in different countries and so on, and that all makes this&nbsp;harder.</p><p>Same story with like climate change, where there are countries who have reasons to push back against action on climate change. Same thing with this. I'd say the point about states not necessarily being the key actors is an important one, and I feel like that speaks to this entire conversation, like is it worth our time to engage with national and international institutions? Well, if they're not the ones that matter, then maybe we have better things to do with our time. That's fair, because it is the case right now that the bulk of work of AI is not being done by governments. It's being done by the private corporate sector and also by academia. Those are, I would say, the two main sources, especially for the artificial general&nbsp;intelligence.</p><p>Last year, I published a survey of general intelligence R&amp;D projects. The bulk of them were in corporations or academia. Relatively little in governments, and those, for the most part, tended to be smaller. There is something to be said for engaging with the corporations and the academic institutions in addition to, or possibly even instead of, the national government ones. But that's a whole other&nbsp;matter.</p><p>With respect to this, though, international institutions can also play a facilitation role. They might not be able to resolve a disagreement but they can at least bring the parties together to talk to them. The United Nations is unusually well-equipped to get, you know, pick your list of countries around the room together and talking. They might not be able to dictate the terms of that conversation and define what the outcome is. They might not be able to enforce whatever agreements, if any, were reached in that conversation. But they can give that conversation a space to happen, and sometimes just having that is&nbsp;worthwhile.</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> To what&nbsp;end?</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> To what end? In getting countries to work on AI in a more cooperative and less competitive fashion. So even in the absence of some kind of overarching enforcement mechanism, you can often get cooperation just through these informal conversations and norms and agreements and so on. The UN can play a facilitation role even if it can't enforce every country to do what they said they would&nbsp;do.</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> What's the best example you have of a facilitated international conversation changing what would have been the default state behavior without that&nbsp;conversation?</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Oh, that's a good question. I'm not sure if I have&nbsp;a\u2026</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> And if anyone actually in the audience actually has\u2026&nbsp;yes.</p><p><strong>Audience Member:</strong> Montreal Protocol.</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> Do you want to expand? I don't think that was not going to&nbsp;happen.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> So the Montreal Protocol for ozone. Did you want to expand on&nbsp;that?</p><p><strong>Audience Member:</strong> Yeah, it was a treaty that reduced emission\u2026 They got a whole bunch of countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases that would effectively destroy the ozone layer, and brought those emissions to very low levels, and now the ozone layer is recovering. Arguably, without that treaty, like maybe that wouldn't have happened. I don't know what the counterfactual would&nbsp;be.</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> Maybe. Yeah, and I think the Montreal\u2026 that's a good example. I think the Montreal Protocol\u2026 there was a clear set of incentives. There were barely any downsides for any state to do that. So put that alongside the Kyoto Protocol, for example, where the ask was somewhat similar, or similarly structured. Off the record, she says as this is being recorded live, I don't think the Kyoto Protocol had any win\u2026 as close as effective as the Montreal Protocol/wasn't even close to achieving whatever the goals were on paper. I think the reason was because the gas that was being targeted, there were very clear economic incentives for states to not mitigate those. In so far as the Montreal Protocol was a good example, it maybe like pointed out a really obvious set of incentives that just were going downhill anyways. But I don't know if it tweaked any of those, would be my response to&nbsp;that.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> It is the case that some types of issues are just easier to get cooperation on than others. If there's a really clear and well-recognized harm from not cooperating, and the cost of cooperating is relatively low. I am not as much an expert on the Montreal Protocol but, superficially, my understanding is that addressing the ozone issue just happened to be easier than addressing the climate change issue, which has just proved to be difficult despite efforts. They might have gone about the Kyoto Protocol in a rather suboptimal fashion potentially but even with a better effort the climate change might just be harder to get collective action on, given the nature of the&nbsp;issue.</p><p>Then likewise, the question for us is so what does AI look like? Is it something that is easy to get cooperation on or not? Then what does that mean for how we would approach&nbsp;it?</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> Yeah, and I think, if anything\u2026 if you were to put the Montreal Protocol on one end of the spectrum where, I guess like the important things to abstract away from that particular case study is that you had a very clear set of incentives to mitigate this thing, and you had basically no incentive for anyone to keep producing the thing. So, that was easy. Then somewhere in the middle is the Kyoto Protocol where you've got pretty large incentives to mitigate the thing because climate, and then you've got some pretty complicated incentives to want to keep producing the thing, and the whole transition process is like hard and whatnot. And then we didn't sufficiently have sort of critical mass of believing that it was important to mitigate the thing, so it just became a lot harder. I think AI, I would put on that end of the spectrum, where you've got so many clear incentives to keep pursuing the thing. If anything, because you've got so many different uses that it's just economically very tasty for countries to pursue, not just countries but a number of other actors who want to pursue it. You've got people who don't even believe it's worth mitigating at&nbsp;all.</p><p>So I think, for that reason, I'd put it as astronomically bloody hard to do the cooperation thing on that side, at least in the format of international institutions. So I think the way to make it easier is to have a smaller number of actors and to align incentives and then to make clearer, sort of like binding mechanisms for that to have a shot in hell at working, in terms of&nbsp;cooperation.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> But it could depend on which AI we're talking about. If you would like an international treaty to just stop the development of AI\u2026 yeah, I mean, good luck with that. That's probably not going to happen. But, that's presumably not what we would want in the first place because we don't need the restriction of all AI. There's plenty of AI that we're pretty confident can be a net positive for the world and we would not want that AI to be restricted. It would be in particular the types of AI that could cause major catastrophes and so on. That's what we would be especially interested in restricting. So an important question, this is actually more of like a technical computer science question than an international institutions question, but it feeds directly into this is, so which AI would we need to restrict? With an eye towards say future catastrophe scenarios, is it really like the core mainstream AI development that needs to be restricted, because all of that is a precursor to the stuff that could get out of hand? Or is it a fairly different, distinct branch of AI research that could go in that direction, such that the mainstream AI work can keep doing what it's doing? So there'll be some harms from it but they'll be more manageable, less catastrophic. How that question is answered, I think, really speaks to the viability of&nbsp;this.</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> Yeah. I guess what I'm skeptical of is the ability to segregate the two. Like I don't think there are clear delineations, and if people have ideas for this please tell me, but I don't think there are clear delineations for separating what are civilian, peaceful, good applications from military applications, at least in technical terms. So it becomes hard, if you want to design a thing, if you don't what the thing is that you're targeting, where you can't even specify what you're targeting to mitigate. So that's something that I'm currently skeptical of, and would love people to suggest&nbsp;otherwise.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Real quick, I would say it's not about civilian versus military, but about&nbsp;whether-</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> Good versus&nbsp;bad.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> But I'm curious to see people's reactions to&nbsp;this.</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> Yes. Yeah.</p><p><strong>Audience Member:</strong> Tangential, but coming back to the\u2026 you sort of were suggesting earlier the information asymmetry with national security is sitting very much on their side. That if they want the information, we're not keeping it from them. They're probably going to have. In a similar vein, do you think that in terms of the UN and the political machinery, that they're even necessarily going to have insight into what their own national security apparatus are working on, what the state of affairs is there? If that's sort of sitting in a separate part of the bureaucratic apparatus from the international agreements, how effective could that ever even be if you don't have that much interface between the two? Does&nbsp;that\u2026</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Essentially like, how can you monitor and enforce an agreement if you don't have access to the information that\u2026 with difficulty. This is a familiar problem, for example, with biological weapons. The technology there can also be used for vaccine development and things of that sort. It can cut both ways and a lot of it is dual-use, that's the catch phrase, and because of that, you have companies that have the right sort of equipment and they don't want other people knowing what they're doing because it's intellectual property. So the answer is with difficulty, and this is a challenge. The more we can be specific about what we need to monitor, the easier it becomes but that doesn't necessarily make it&nbsp;easy.</p><p><strong>Audience Member:</strong> Something governments seem to hate is putting the brakes on anything that's like making them money, tax money. But something they seem to love is getting more control and oversight into corporations, especially if they think there's any sort of reputational risk or risk to them, and that the control and oversight is not going to pose any sort of economic slowdown in costs. Do you think there's a possibility of framing the message simply as, the countries should agree that non-state actors get to be spied on by states, and the states get some sort of oversight? And the states might all agree to that, even if the non-state actors don't like it very much. And the non-state actors might be okay if there was no\u2026 if it seemed like it was toothless at the start. So maybe if there was some sort of like slippery slope into government oversight to make things more safe that could be started with relatively low&nbsp;barrier.</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> Nice. I like the way you think. That's nice. Yeah, I think the short answer is yes. I think the major hurdle there is that firms will hate it. Firms, particularly multinational technology firms, that actually have a fair amount of sway in a number of different dimensions of sway, just won't be good with it and will threaten some things that states care&nbsp;about.</p><p><strong>Audience Member:</strong> As someone who does AI research for a multinational firm, I really do actually feel a lot of friction when allowing certain sorts of code to cross national boundaries. So actually, I would like to say that state regulation is making more of an impact than you might realize, that there are certain sorts of things, especially around encryption protocols, where state agreements have made a big difference as to what can cross state boundaries, even with a lot of states not being in on the agreement. Just like the developed nations as of 30 years ago all agreeing, \"Hey, we're going to keep the encryption to ourselves.\" Means that my coworkers in India don't get to see everything I get to work with because there's protocols in place. So, it does matter to international organizations, if you can get the laws passed in the first&nbsp;place.</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> Yeah, sure. Any other examples aside from encryption, out of curiosity? I know the encryption side of it relatively well but are there&nbsp;other-</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> Well, there's the privacy. My American nonprofit organization had to figure out if we needed to do anything to comply with Europe's new privacy&nbsp;law.</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> You sound very happy about&nbsp;that.</p><p><strong>Seth:</strong> I say nothing. We are just about out of time, though, so maybe we should try to wrap up a little bit as far as take home messages. I feel like we did not fully answer the question of the extent to which engaging with national and international organizations is worth our time in the first place, to the question of like are these even the key actors? Superficially, noting we're basically out of time, I can say there are at least some reasons to believe they could end up being important actors and that I feel like it is worth at least some effort to engage with, though we should not put all our eggs in that basket, noting that other actors can be very important. Then, as far as how to pursue it, I would just say that we should try to do it cautiously and with skill, and by engaging very deeply and understanding the communities that we're working&nbsp;with.</p><p><strong>Jade:</strong> I think the meta point maybe to point out as well is that these are very much\u2026 hopefully, illustratively, it's a very much alive debate on both of these questions. It's hard and there are a lot of strategic parameters that matter, and it's hard to figure out what the right strategy is moving forward and I hope you're not taking away that there are perspectives that are held strongly within this community. I hope you're mostly taking away that it's a hard set of questions that needs a lot more thought, but more so than anything it needs a lot more caution in terms of how we think about it because I think there are important things to consider. So, hopefully that's what you're taking away. If you're not, that should be what you're taking away.

Sparta is an amazing city-state, entirely built around trying to build the perfect army. And so, communities in general can be more or less like trying to be an army. The idea is, you've got this single goal. You've really got something you're trying to achieve. If you want to achieve this goal, you want to enforce conformity of beliefs, and conformity of values. Conformity with respect to what the end goals are. You also want a kind of hierarchy as well, so that it's unquestioned who you listen to and whose views are less important. That\u2019s one model I think you can have for the sort of ideal community you can aspire&nbsp;towards.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1yh0w6BGeIu2ewmu4uIKme/c3af0e8a8dc96390176896bbf9b89bf4/image.png?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1yh0w6BGeIu2ewmu4uIKme/c3af0e8a8dc96390176896bbf9b89bf4/image.png?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1yh0w6BGeIu2ewmu4uIKme/c3af0e8a8dc96390176896bbf9b89bf4/image.png?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1yh0w6BGeIu2ewmu4uIKme/c3af0e8a8dc96390176896bbf9b89bf4/image.png?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1yh0w6BGeIu2ewmu4uIKme/c3af0e8a8dc96390176896bbf9b89bf4/image.png?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1yh0w6BGeIu2ewmu4uIKme/c3af0e8a8dc96390176896bbf9b89bf4/image.png?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/1yh0w6BGeIu2ewmu4uIKme/c3af0e8a8dc96390176896bbf9b89bf4/image.png?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Second, in contrast, is ancient Athens, and it's very different what the Athenians prized. It was not so much having a goal: instead they were in the marketplace of ideas. It was really cherishing open ended discussion, and following the argument wherever it leads. It was also the case that, there was far less conformity of ideas. It was much more about celebrating diversity, celebrating disagreement, and not the same sort of hierarchy as in&nbsp;Sparta.</p><p>Socrates could accost someone in the square, and the idea \u2013 at least with the ideals they had \u2013 was that the best argument would win. And so when I present these two (Athens and Sparta), the question is, well, what sort of community do we want to be? I bet you're all thinking Sparta because they look badass. No, I'm imagining most of you are thinking in this setup: \u201cObviously we want to be more like the Athenians and less like the Spartans.\u201d It's true that there were many, many benefits for the kind of Athenian sort of community over the Spartan. One is just, well, what if you're wrong about your goal? What if you're aiming at the wrong thing or at least some of your beliefs are incorrect? It seems like social or intellectual movements in general can suffer from this problem where certain beliefs become indicators of tribal&nbsp;membership.</p><p>So if you look at the environmentalist movement, for example, it really cares about environmental destruction, about climate change above anything, but then also one of its core beliefs, at least very commonly, is also being against nuclear power, which from my perspective seems just completely insane. It seems like this is an amazing partial solution to the problem of climate change, but it's been debarred because certain attitudes to nuclear power are just part of what it means to be part of the environmentalist movement. That seems pretty&nbsp;bad.</p><p>There are other benefits in favor of the more Athenian approach as well. One is you've got a broader appeal \u2013 you\u2019re no longer having to select on a very narrow set of beliefs and preferences or values, and that means you can have a much wider&nbsp;appeal.</p><p>Athenian communities are possibly less fragile as well. You avoid the narcissism of small differences, people are more comfortable with disagreement, and so there's perhaps less of a risk from the infighting which so often plagues other social and intellectual movements. But I think the main thing I want to convey is that actually, there is a genuine tension between being Athenian or Spartan. It's a genuinely deep problem. And the main reason is, have you ever tried to get a group of philosophers to do anything? It's extremely difficult! I was at a philosophy conference just a couple of weeks ago and we were trying to get everyone to go to the bar after the conference. It takes about an hour to rally everyone together. Finally, you get people moving in the right direction and they all follow each other, so they don't actually know where they're going. And then we get to the bar and everyone stops outside and just has their conversation. And if you ask them, why have we stopped, they're like, \u201cOh, I don't know. I guess the, um, you can't get in or something.\u201d No one thought about the very final stage which is opening the door and going in. And this is a problem because we as a community, we really want to achieve things. We think we\u2019ve really got big problems in the world, and we want to solve&nbsp;them.</p><p>If there's something that's good about building an army, it\u2019s that they\u2019re very good about doing things. And so, there are real benefits of conformity of beliefs and conformity of values. You get to solve principal agent problems. You know if someone has the same beliefs and values as you, and you tell them to do something, that they're going to pursue that goal. And they\u2019ll pursue it basically the same way you would: you don't have to spend effort and resources checking up on them. Also it means you can have extremely high levels of trust as well. In general, it's actually kind of like the shared aims community that we talked about a lot last year. It's very powerful, the level of cooperation and coordination you can have if everyone has the same beliefs and same values. I also think there are structural reasons for some pressure that pushes communities towards being more like Sparta and less like&nbsp;Athens.</p><p>One is just because if there are organizations that are wanting to do something, they're going to want to hire people who have similar worldviews, and have similar beliefs because they're going to be able to work better together. Or if they're providing training or help to someone, it\u2019ll seem like a better deal for them if they can do that to someone who's going to act more like they would think is the right way to act. So again, you're gonna get preferential assistance provided to people who have beliefs and values that are more like the mainstream. Then also, as a community grows, you more and more are going to have to start relying on social epistemology. You're going to have to start deferring to certain people because there\u2019s not enough time for everyone to scrutinize everything all at&nbsp;once.</p><p>And again, that's very good! In fact, it's vital. We wouldn't be able to have a sophisticated number of beliefs if we didn't do that, but it becomes much more fragile because a lot of weight is being put on the views of a smaller number of people. So I think it's no surprise that when you look around at different social movements, they often have this Spartan army mentality. I think it\u2019s kind of the way humans are programmed. And that means that we can\u2019t just blindly say: \u201cOh yeah, of course \u2013 Athens \u2013 we\u2019re free thinkers. We want to be questioning everything, that's what we're like.\u201d Instead, it's going to require quite a bit more work. And the solution is that we want to try and get the best of both&nbsp;worlds.</p><p>In a slogan, I think we want to try and build an army of philosophers. I think I'm the first person to ever have suggested this idea, but I'm going to stand by it. I think there's a few ways in which we can actually make this happen. So one is having a community that \u2013 and this is a core part of the effective altruist project \u2013 is having a community that's based on a higher order level of meta than many other communities. It's not about any particular belief, but it's about three things which are all quite abstractly&nbsp;stated.</p><ol><li>A decision theoretic idea of trying to maximize rather than just satisfice (or, do \u201cenough\u201d)&nbsp;good.</li><li>An epistemological view which is being very aligned with science, being kind of broadly Bayesian in the way we think about&nbsp;things.</li><li>Set values where firstly, we just think everyone counts equally, and then we also think that promoting wellbeing is among the most important things we could be doing right&nbsp;now.</li></ol><p>I think, importantly, that does actually rule out a lot of different possible views in the world. I think it'd be really bad to start defining effective altruism so broadly that everything counts. I have a friend who I asked, what do you think effective altruism is? He said, \u201cI think effective altruism is acting with integrity.\u201d And obviously, that's way too broad. Then this community is just everyone, because everyone wants to aspire to that. But at the same time, there's still a huge possibility to have differing beliefs about how you do the most good and differing values as well because within this kind of broad idea of impartiality and welfare, there's still tons of opportunity to have&nbsp;differences.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4ecFcQF67SGkcW0o8OIEEs/37b74c9aef017b38fc05ed2bf3b1c296/image.png?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4ecFcQF67SGkcW0o8OIEEs/37b74c9aef017b38fc05ed2bf3b1c296/image.png?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4ecFcQF67SGkcW0o8OIEEs/37b74c9aef017b38fc05ed2bf3b1c296/image.png?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4ecFcQF67SGkcW0o8OIEEs/37b74c9aef017b38fc05ed2bf3b1c296/image.png?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4ecFcQF67SGkcW0o8OIEEs/37b74c9aef017b38fc05ed2bf3b1c296/image.png?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4ecFcQF67SGkcW0o8OIEEs/37b74c9aef017b38fc05ed2bf3b1c296/image.png?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/4ecFcQF67SGkcW0o8OIEEs/37b74c9aef017b38fc05ed2bf3b1c296/image.png?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>One potential solution is noting that what unifies us is a meta-level agreement and that can still unify us even if we have very different views at the object level. Another is then just having really strong coordination norms. Part of the push towards being more like Sparta is because it's so helpful with coordination. It means you can have trust in others. You don't have to check up on people to see how they're doing. But if we have very strong norms where people coordinate, where even if we have very different views, we still trust each other and work together, then the additional benefits of having conformity of beliefs and values are lessened to quite an&nbsp;extent.</p><p>I actually think we do really well in this as a community. We emphasized that a lot last year. And then another solution is a cultural one, where people feel trusted and safe in the ability to express more unusual views. You're able to disagree with others without being disagreeable, without getting angry, without feeling like you\u2019re going to be kind of alienated or pushed out or criticized in some way, just for having a different set of views. I think that's extremely important as well. And that's something we want to put the spotlight on for this conference. And so with that in mind, I'm going to propose an experiment that we can all try for this weekend: no idea how it will go, but we'll find&nbsp;out.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2ApQzHubygIMSkCS6Ee6cu/2785025ae6944db7978a2bda1ac5ef9c/image.png?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2ApQzHubygIMSkCS6Ee6cu/2785025ae6944db7978a2bda1ac5ef9c/image.png?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2ApQzHubygIMSkCS6Ee6cu/2785025ae6944db7978a2bda1ac5ef9c/image.png?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2ApQzHubygIMSkCS6Ee6cu/2785025ae6944db7978a2bda1ac5ef9c/image.png?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2ApQzHubygIMSkCS6Ee6cu/2785025ae6944db7978a2bda1ac5ef9c/image.png?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2ApQzHubygIMSkCS6Ee6cu/2785025ae6944db7978a2bda1ac5ef9c/image.png?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/2ApQzHubygIMSkCS6Ee6cu/2785025ae6944db7978a2bda1ac5ef9c/image.png?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Eliezer Yudkowsky once had this blog post about holding a New Day where you don't visit a website you've visited before, you don't read any books you've read before, you just do everything completely new, including when you become aware of yourself using any thought you\u2019ve thunk before, then muse on something else. I was inspired by this. I think we can have the idea of taking one belief, one view that you have that is particularly dear to you, that really is an important assumption to your whole view of the world and try your best, at least for some of the conference, to believe the&nbsp;opposite.</p><p>When I first saw this, I was like, this could really be carnage. You've got people not believing in gravity and like walking off the building and so on. Maybe don't go that far. Here are examples of some views that are like particularly commonly held within effective altruism and at least for some of the time you might want to try thinking\u2026 perhaps you're at a talk and you think \u201cWell, I'm at this talk that I agree with. How would this look if I had the opposite of this assumption that I'm questioning?\u201d Or, in fact, go to talks that would only make sense for you to go to if you had the opposite of this belief, or deliberately find the people who you disagree with, and don't try and get into an argument about who\u2019s right. Instead, really try and see what the world looks like from that other&nbsp;perspective.</p><p>Part of the reason I'm interested in experimenting with this is I think very often, at least when we hold a particular view, it's not so much that we have reasons on one side and the other and assess that, but it's more that the particular view is part of an overall worldview, and it makes sense given that worldview. And then if you can try and switch that you can maybe start to see, wow, how does everything look, how does everything fit together if you have a very different worldview? So I think the approach is actually similar to simulated annealing in machine learning where the ideas, rather than simply optimizing on whatever belief change looks best on the margin, sometimes \u2013 regularly \u2013 you just do something completely random. And the reason this happens with machine learning is to avoid a local optimum, where you think, well, any particular change I make just now looks worse, looks less plausible, but then that means you're stuck, while there's actually perhaps some better worldview that fits as a package&nbsp;together.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:750px;\"><img src=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3dtoi6jSXS6Q6wogQcgC64/c6d08124f1500bc8b22509dffeb51c57/image.png?w=100&amp;q=50\" srcset=\"https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3dtoi6jSXS6Q6wogQcgC64/c6d08124f1500bc8b22509dffeb51c57/image.png?w=100&amp;q=50 100w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3dtoi6jSXS6Q6wogQcgC64/c6d08124f1500bc8b22509dffeb51c57/image.png?w=480&amp;q=70 480w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3dtoi6jSXS6Q6wogQcgC64/c6d08124f1500bc8b22509dffeb51c57/image.png?w=768&amp;q=70 768w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3dtoi6jSXS6Q6wogQcgC64/c6d08124f1500bc8b22509dffeb51c57/image.png?w=992&amp;q=70 992w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3dtoi6jSXS6Q6wogQcgC64/c6d08124f1500bc8b22509dffeb51c57/image.png?w=1200&amp;q=70 1200w, https://images.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/3dtoi6jSXS6Q6wogQcgC64/c6d08124f1500bc8b22509dffeb51c57/image.png?w=1800&amp;q=70 1800w\"></figure><p>Going back to the list of new ideas we could have, avoid what Scott Alexander calls a \u201c50 more Stalins\u201d approach where \u2013 for example \u2013 perhaps you're someone who thinks that AI timelines are very short or something.

I'm going to try and think, well, how would I start to see the world if I actually thought: \u201cPhilosophical arguments don't have a very good track record.

He starts with a good overview of the principles of Kantian ethics. He then underlines the fact that we have a general duty towards beneficence, making others&apos; happiness our own end. He states that Kant&apos;s system places beneficence as an imperfect duty, which implies that it is not as important as refraining from violations of stronger duties like justice and respect. He also quotes Kant to point out that being partial towards some people does not violate the duty of beneficence.</p>\n<p>But one of the first things that Hill does is to distinguish a special and more demanding case of beneficence, the duty to aid, which is for &quot;those in distress, for example, those needing immediate help to meet basic needs for survival and tolerable existence.&quot; Hill says that &quot;it seems presumptively wrong, contrary to the dignity of humanity, to let a person starve to death or live in mind- numbing squalor when one can easily prevent this.&quot; Unfortunately, he writes as if this is a special case of unusual emergency scenarios, like drowning children in ponds. Yet, for the hundreds of millions of people who are facing fatal diseases and severe poverty, this need for aid is already the state of affairs, and we can help them through existing charities. It is also the case for perhaps every animal in factory farms and the people who would die in the potential future extinction event that one might only solve through immediate efforts. Since this state of affairs is not going to go away for the foreseeable future, it&apos;s not clear how there is any room at all for one to be benevolent in other ways. Any beneficence towards less serious causes is going to take place at the direct expense of our duty to aid the worst off. Hill does not address this objection.</p>\n<p>Elsewhere, Hill answers a typical drowning child type scenario by invoking a different duty, the principle of mutual aid, wherein we must help those in dire distress when the cost to ourselves is low and there are no overriding moral concerns. He does not explain how this is different from the duty to aid, and again he does not explain why donating to charity wouldn&apos;t fall under the duty of mutual aid.</p>\n<p>However, these issues don&apos;t matter anymore if giving is a matter of justice, because justice is a perfect duty that supersedes all others. Hill argues that charitable giving falls under the duty of justice rather than beneficence <em>if</em> the wealth was acquired through unjust means. Hill goes on to point out that Kant viewed charity from the very rich as something that is owed, rather than something that is meritorious, but beneficence is a duty too, even if it is an imperfect one, and Hill does not explain how classifying giving as something that is owed implies that it is a matter of justice; Kant&apos;s imperfect duties are perfectly capable of generating moral obligations. Hill also references Kant&apos;s statement that giving is often an obligation rather than a gift because the wealth often comes from injustices of the government. It is not clear to me if this implies that a just person, who was able to obtain wealth as a result of the government&apos;s injustice, has a judicial obligation to give. Needless to say, the question of which kinds of wealth acquisition are or aren&apos;t just is a huge one, where I suspect there is plenty of room to dispute the extent of injustice in contemporary business and government.</p>\n<p>Regardless, when giving is a matter of justice it cannot be compromised in favor of other duties. For instance, our imperfect duties for self development are always subservient to the imperative to donate our money. Likewise our imperfect duties to aid those in distress are always subservient to our duty to make justice-based reparations.</p>\n<p>It seems clear to me that only particular causes might constitute a reparation of injustice. If the injustice was done to a specific person - for instance, I ripped off the co-founder of my startup or something of the sort - then naturally I have an obligation to repay her. If the injustice was done to all my employees then I should repay them. Similarly, we might think that if the injustice is something systemic, e.g. the structure of the whole global economy is unjust and it is wrong to participate in it, then I should donate to any poor people in the world who I can help. But it seems to me that if a wealthy person is responsible for the poverty of all those who have been wronged by the system that made them wealthy, then they are also responsible for the animals who have been wronged by that system, as well as the deaths and foregone births of those who are the victims of extinction events that are caused or allowed by that system. For instance, if we think that the capitalist system is globally unjust so that it is responsible for all poverty, we should note that it is responsible for factory farms and risky technological experimentation as well. Similar arguments could be made for a multitude of non-EA causes. So if someone has wealth that comes from injustice, they may be obligated to repay one particular person, or they may have an open mandate to donate to almost any cause, or anything in between - depending on the kind of injustice and how you interpret its resulting obligations.</p>\n<p>But cause selection for the reparative donor can be constrained by effectiveness concerns just as it is for a consequentialist donor. Perfect duties must always be fulfilled to the &quot;fullest extent possible&quot; <a href=\"https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/kant.1971.62.issue-1-4/kant.1971.62.1-4.55/kant.1971.62.1-4.55.xml\">(Hill 1971)</a>, so giving-as-justice seems to entail an obligation for effectiveness. Hill denies that there are any values in Kant&apos;s system, even lives, that one can aggregate and maximize. But, does this mean that it literally does not matter how many people are saved? Such a view would be preposterous. Unfortunately Hill&apos;s following statements are extremely vague and it is not even clear if he is trying to elaborate upon this point or if he is simply moving on to making a different one. But elsewhere in the chapter, Hill clearly makes a distinction between saving all the drowning people from saving a few of them and quitting, and mentions how actions can be wrong in virtue of indicating that people have the wrong priorities. While the aggregate number of lives saved isn&apos;t a moral object in its own right for Kant, it still seems to be a fact that people can respond to and care about in their fulfillment of moral duties. Extending this logic, it seems clear that donating to an ineffective charity shows that one has other priorities than saving people. If one&apos;s duty to give is imperfect - ordinary beneficence - then it is permissible to be partial and relaxed about it, as Hill points out, as long as one sincerely values the happiness of all other people. But if one&apos;s duty to give is perfect - justice - then such partiality would constitute a failure to prioritize one&apos;s perfect duty.</p>\n<p>The principle of mutual aid and the duty to aid are both imperfect duties, so we don&apos;t have to fulfill them to the fullest extent possible. However, Hill (and Kant, it would seem) considers them to be stricter than ordinary beneficence. The exact nature of this middle ground is left unclear, and this is very disappointing given that it probably constitutes the majority of our obligations to give. I am likewise disappointed that Hill does not spell out the details of how wealth should be given out if it was earned via injustice, though in this case I find it easier to figure out the logical implications of Hill&apos;s system.</p>\n<p>In summary, I believe these are the correct takeaways from Hill&apos;s framework:</p>\n<p>* If wealth was gathered via injustice, donate to whatever effective charity is most effective in serving as reparation to that injustice, up until the point that further donations would be counterproductive to your future ability to make more reparations.</p>\n<p>* If wealth was not gathered via injustice, donate it to a charity that helps those who are in dire need. You must give at least some moral priority to effectiveness, and donate quite a bit of money, doing your best to balance these goals with other moral duties.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile, it is worth pointing out that David Cummiskey <a href=\"http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/0195094530.001.0001/acprof-9780195094534\">(1996)</a> has an alternative, less mainstream interpretation of Kant wherein we are obligated to follow an agent neutral consequentialism, promoting the good as much as possible. It is much more strict than Hill&apos;s conception of ordinary beneficence in terms of both prioritization and demandingness, but perhaps not more strict than the triad of duties towards justice, aid and mutual aid that I investigate here. In this chapter, Hill defends his view from some of Cummiskey&apos;s arguments, but does not go deep into the dispute.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "kbog"}}, {"_id": "gNHFRWyo58cTQ8pe8", "title": "EA Forum 2.0 Initial Announcement", "postedAt": "2018-07-19T11:25:13.870Z", "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>At the request of Ryan Carey, who set up the EA Forum, CEA took over its running last year, as announced in <a href=\"/ea/1c7/changes_to_the_ea_forum/\">this post</a>. Here we give an update on what we plan to do with it. These are our initial thoughts - we\u2019d welcome feedback on how they could be improved.</p><p>In summary, the technology of the current version of the Forum will reach end of life this calendar year. We plan to transfer to a new Forum at forum.effectivealtruism.org, using the codebase of the new <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/\">LessWrong.com</a> (for more detail on how we made this decision please see the \u2018Technical Background\u2019 section below). Content, user accounts and karma from the old Forum will be transferred, and old links redirected as needed.</p><p>The move will lead to some changes in how the Forum appears:</p><ul><li>We will have a \u201ccommunity\u201d subforum, which we are planning to reserve for organizational updates and discussion of community issues and resources (although we haven\u2019t yet decided on the distinction).</li><li>In contrast to the current system where posts are displayed in reverse chronological order, top-rated posts will appear higher on the page. We expect this will make it easier for readers to see the best-quality content quickly.</li><li>It will be possible to view content in ordered collections (\u2018sequences\u2019).</li><li>Users will have profiles, where they can display information about their interests.</li><li>The Karma system and frontpage design will also be different.</li></ul><p>We are also using this opportunity to improve moderation and content on the Forum. We will be working with some of the top forum posters and thinkers in the community to encourage them to post more frequently to the Forum, and we will be cross-posting high quality content from elsewhere. The amount of effort put into moderation will be increased, aiming to give detailed feedback on what content is useful.</p><p>In this post, we aim to explain why we think we should make these changes, set out what this will mean for Forum users, and seek your feedback on our plans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Aims</h1><p>Our vision is that the Forum becomes the main hub for content and discussion in the community. We\u2019d like most of the thinking that the community does to go on the Forum, with all of EA\u2019s top researchers posting and commenting regularly.&nbsp;</p><p>We think that this has several benefits for the community:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>More content accessible</strong>: Many people in the core of the community have unpublished rough notes on topics, or interesting ideas that aren\u2019t suitable for e.g. academic publication. They may not want the overhead associated with running their own blog, or may want more feedback than they would get on their own blog. If they know that posting to the Forum will reliably get them credit, and useful comments, they\u2019re more likely to post there.</li><li><strong>Easier to find content</strong>: The Forum\u2019s search function should turn up most of the relevant thinking on a topic, whereas currently much is scattered on personal blogs. Similarly, people looking to get their daily fix of EA content should be able to find it on the Forum, rather than scattered on blogs.</li><li><strong>More engagement</strong>: If more people are posting, more will be reading and commenting. We hope that this means that good posts get more engagement than they have in the past year or so of the Forum. Ideally, it becomes a place of lively debate between different perspectives within the community.</li><li><strong>A single point of discussion</strong>: If more discussion is concentrated in one place, we hope it will be easier to keep the community synced up, and learning from each other.</li></ul><p>To this end, our first goal is to ensure that the Forum is used by the top content producers in EA.</p><p>If we achieve this first goal, then we think that the Forum will be an excellent way to onboard newer people to the community, because: they will be exposed to high quality, fresh content; they will then have the opportunity to engage with that content and contribute themselves; and they will get high-quality feedback on what content of theirs is especially good, allowing them to become familiar with EA topics and community discussion norms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>How will the EA Forum change?</h1><h2>New features on initial release</h2><p>Besides the updated design of the platform, in the initial release we expect users to benefit from the following features:</p><p><strong>Sorting by popularity/engagement rather than only time order</strong></p><p>The current Forum presents posts to users only based on time order, with the most recent posts appearing at the top of the page. The new front page will use a slightly modified version of the Hacker News algorithm to order posts by number of upvotes and amount of engagement. This should ensure that popular posts won\u2019t be crowded out simply due to new posts being made. We expect this to improve the experience of reading the Forum, make it easier for users to find the best content and reduce the cost to posting additional content to the Forum. Posts about less-general interest topics will be visible to those who seek them out, but will not appear on the front page unless they attract upvotes. We hope that this will encourage more people to post thoughts and works-in-progress to the Forum for feedback.</p><p><strong>A community subforum</strong></p><p>In addition to the main Forum, we will have a subforum which we are tentatively planning to call \u201cCommunity\u201d. We expect to use this category for discussion about issues in the EA community, organizational updates and meta discussion about the Forum itself.</p><p><strong>Subscribing to users</strong></p><p>It will be possible to subscribe to particular users\u2019 contributions. Each user\u2019s page also functions as a kind of personal blog, with a space to write about their interests and approach to problems. This should help users personalize their content feed over time to be better focused on areas they are interested in.</p><p><strong>Sequences</strong></p><p>A sequence is a set of linked articles on a particular topic. Any user will be able to create sequences, whether this be from their own original content, or as a way to collect their favorite pieces on a topic. Highly upvoted, user-created sequences will be discoverable by other users. We hope that this will help posters develop ideas in more depth, while keeping individual posts to a readable length, and that users stop having to post multiple, numbered parts to longer posts. It should also be a neat way to present canonical content to new users. You can see <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/library\">some examples of sequences on LW</a>.</p><p><strong>A reworked karma system</strong></p><p>We will be aiming to transfer user accounts along with karma from the old to the new site in time for release. Also, the way the karma system will function will be slightly different, mainly by giving a slightly higher weight to up- and down-votes from users who themselves have more karma. There will also be the possibility to choose between giving a small up/downvote or giving a larger boost by holding the up/downvote button.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7Sx3CJXA7JHxY2yDG/strong-votes-update-deployed\">best summary of how this works</a> is that:</p><p>Normal votes (one click) will be worth</p><ul><li>3 points \u2013 if you have 25,000 karma or more</li><li><strong>2 points \u2013 if you have 1,000 karma (currently no EA Forum user is above the 2-point level)</strong></li><li><strong>1 point &nbsp;\u2013 if you have 0 karma</strong></li></ul><p>Strong Votes (click and hold) will be worth</p><ul><li>16 points (maximum) \u2013 if you have 500,000 karma</li><li>15 points \u2013 250,000</li><li>14 points \u2013 175,000</li><li>13 points \u2013 100,000</li><li>12 points \u2013 75,000</li><li>11 points \u2013 50,000</li><li>10 points \u2013 25,000</li><li>9 points &nbsp;\u2013 10,000</li><li><strong>8 points &nbsp;\u2013 5,000 (Currently no EA Forum user is above&nbsp;the 8-point level)</strong></li><li><strong>7 points &nbsp;\u2013 2,500</strong></li><li><strong>6 points &nbsp;\u2013 1,000</strong></li><li><strong>5 points &nbsp;\u2013 500</strong></li><li><strong>4 points &nbsp;\u2013 250</strong></li><li><strong>3 points &nbsp;\u2013 100</strong></li><li><strong>2 points &nbsp;\u2013 10</strong></li><li><strong>1 point \u2013 0</strong></li></ul><p>We think that the EA community should aspire to particularly high standards of discussion, and that the best way to maintain those standards is to give those who have contributed to the community more ability to signal what content is good for the Forum than someone who has just created an account. However, we obviously don\u2019t want this to become a tyranny of a few users. There are several users, holding very different viewpoints, who currently have high karma on the Forum, and we hope that this will help maintain a varied discussion, while still ensuring that the Forum has strong discussion standards.</p><p>The distinction between normal and strong votes seems useful because it helps to differentiate between posts and comments which are \u201cgood\u201d, and those that are excellent, and should be read by others. You can read more at <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7Sx3CJXA7JHxY2yDG/strong-votes-update-deployed\">this post</a>.</p><p><strong>Support for Markdown and LaTeX</strong>: Will make it easier for people to format posts nicely, and include formulae where relevant.</p><p><strong>Moving to forum.effectivealtruism.org</strong>: We plan to move the Forum to a new domain \u2013 forum.effectivealtruism.org \u2013 to avoid the confusing proliferation of domains. We\u2019ll also try to bring some of the branding into alignment with effectivealtruism.org. We\u2019ll make sure that we follow good practices for redirecting links etc. to ensure that Forum content is still easily searchable using Google.</p><h2>Possible features after initial release</h2><p>After we have successfully released the initial version of the Forum, we expect to continue development on some or all of the below features. These are just preliminary ideas, and we are going to be responding to feedback to determine how to best prioritize among them, or what other ideas we should put effort into.</p><p><strong>Different landing pages for new users vs old hands</strong>: We are hoping that the new EA Forum will eventually become a good place to direct people relatively new to the community who would like to find out more. To this end we will be able to have the landing page for non-signed in users show a collection of core content, and then only once a user creates an account will they see more recent discussions. Hopefully this will encourage new users to get up to speed with the basics before engaging with new (possibly more advanced/weirder) content.</p><p><strong>Additional subforums</strong>: (<a href=\"/ea/1c7/changes_to_the_ea_forum/bb2\">As requested.</a>) In the initial release we will have one main forum with a \u201cCommunity\u201d subforum. It may be possible in the longer-term to add more subforums, though we would want to ensure that there is enough content in each potential new category to justify this. An alternative solution may be to implement a tag system. Our work on this will also be determined by what features the LessWrong team ends up implementing in this space.</p><p><strong>Page for local groups and events</strong>: In the future we may want to add a page devoted to local groups and events, like <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/community\">LessWrong\u2019s community page</a>. We will determine whether adding this functionality makes sense after release.</p><p><strong>Community-sourced ideas</strong>: We would like to hear from the users of the new Forum to help shape development priorities. We believe that the best ideas are often missed when making an initial project plan, but are likely to emerge from users once they are actually using a platform. As such we will be maintaining open communication with users in order to make sure we capitalize on high expected value improvements.</p><h2>Moderation and curation</h2><p><strong>More active moderation</strong>: Recently, moderation on the Forum has mostly been about removing spam. We think that a better goal for moderation is to improve the quality of thinking and debate on the Forum. Therefore, we think that it might be useful to have a more active, positive form of moderation. In particular, we are considering investing moderator time in giving detailed feedback on posts and comments. We aim to draw up some more detailed plans for moderation before the release of the Forum, and we will post these plans to the current Forum for feedback, and to the new Forum for transparency. To facilitate this more time-intensive moderation, we plan to bring on Max Dalton as a fourth moderator (in addition to Howie Lempel, Julia Wise, and Denise Melchin) and we will consider paying moderators for the time they spend on this.</p><p><strong>Creating more link posts</strong>: Currently we are hesitant about allowing lots of link posts on the Forum, because they displace original content. Because the new Forum will by-default sort by engagement, we are less worried about this effect. Additionally, we hope that link posts can help to consolidate content to reach our vision of the Forum as a central hub for content in the community.</p><p><strong>Encouraging top thinkers to post more</strong>: We plan to engage with EA researchers and leaders and encourage them to post more frequently.</p><p><strong>Curating and choosing sequences</strong>: We plan to curate sequences of posts on a variety of topics from existing Forum content. Users are also free to curate their own sequences, and vote on which sequences are best. Moderators can choose which sequences to promote (e.g. on the front page for non-logged-in users). We will consult with moderators and our advisory committee on this, and we also welcome ideas and feedback in the comments. One sequence that we think would be well suited to this role is <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/handbook/\">CEA\u2019s EA Handbook</a> (<a href=\"/ea/1np/announcing_the_effective_altruism_handbook_2nd/ed9\">note that this will soon have updated contents</a>). We encourage you to create additional and alternative sequences.</p><p><strong>Consulting with related forums</strong>: We will consult the moderators of LessWrong, the EA subreddit, and the main EA Facebook group about how we should relate to these different spaces. By default, we will keep the relationships as they were previously (for example in which types of content are cross-posted to which spaces), but there might be improvements that can be made.</p><p><strong>Possible future plans</strong>: In the future, we may experiment with giving prizes for good content (along the lines of the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4WbNGQMvuFtY3So7s/announcement-ai-alignment-prize-winners-and-next-round\">AI alignment prize</a>).</p><h1>&nbsp;</h1><h1>Technical Background</h1><p>Since CEA took responsibility for the Forum, we have been thinking about how best to improve the experience for users and what should come next for the project. We were limited, however, in our ability to make improvements and changes to the current version, due to our team\u2019s unfamiliarity with the codebase.</p><p>Additionally, it was becoming clear that the current version of the software was nearing the end of its lifespan, and Trike Apps (the Forum\u2019s current hosting providers) confirmed that they would be forced to stop their hosting and maintenance services at the end of 2018.</p><p>As such, we have since been looking into the best options for building a new version of the service. We were considering four main approaches over the first half of 2018:</p><p>Use an off-the-shelf discussion software platform, and customize it for the needs of our community;</p><p>Spend time getting familiar with the codebase/stack that runs the existing Forum, patching/upgrading the software ourselves or porting the installation to a new server;</p><p>Use the LessWrong 2.0 codebase, and customise that; or</p><p>Build a solution from scratch, in-house.</p><p>After evaluating the above options we think that using the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/\">LessWrong 2.0</a> (LW2) codebase would be the best way forward.</p><p>We decided on this approach because we were not able to find an off-the-shelf solution as well targeted to our use-case as LW2. Their team has spent the past year thinking about how to create the best discussion platform for a community adjacent to ours, with very similar goals of enabling intellectual progress on important questions and helping create common knowledge in a (mostly) online community.</p><p>We evaluated the costs of simply sticking with the existing codebase. However, we were cautioned against this by Trike Apps, who believe that the setup is fairly brittle, and that it would be difficult to get running on a different server environment. Given that LW2 faced similar problems, and made the decision to develop a new, modern webapp, we believed it made sense to follow their lead.</p><p>In this light, building a solution from scratch also seemed a less attractive option, as we would likely have duplicated a lot of the LessWrong team\u2019s work, and it was plausible that our version would have converged on similar solutions to issues we were hoping to solve.</p><p>There are some downsides to this approach. In particular, there is a risk in using software that is relatively new, and does not have either a) a wide base of open-source contributors or b) a large commercial software company backing it. However,</p><ul><li>The LessWrong team has proven itself to be capable at delivering a product;</li><li>The code has been tested in production for nearly a year;</li><li>The team plans to continue full-time development and support on the product;</li><li>The software is fairly modular and is built on top of well-documented open-source components (Meteor, Vulcan, React, GraphQL); and</li><li>The team is located very close to CEA\u2019s development team (in Berkeley), and plans to provide setup advice and ongoing support.</li></ul><p>As such, we believe this is the right call, all things considered. CEA will have a formal support arrangement with them.</p><p>LW1 was hosted in a very similar setup (and in fact the impending End Of Life that will affect the EA Forum would have also affected the previous version of LessWrong). Consequently, the team has experience migrating data from a very similar system. This means that we can be more confident that the existing Forum data can be safely ported, that we will not need to maintain separate archives for older content, and that we will avoid broken links and other annoyances.</p><p>We plan to maintain the codebase as a fork of LW2, with the LW2 codebase as an upstream repo, and prefer submitting PRs upstream to making local changes. We\u2019ll make minimal changes to the site\u2019s theming to make it more similar to effectivealtruism.org, but otherwise attempt to run the codebase as closely as possible to LW2. This ensures that most of the maintenance stays with a development team that is familiar with the codebase, minimizes the risk that CEA will be unable to maintain the forum in the future, and means that any improvements to one codebase will be shared by the other.&nbsp;</p><h1>&nbsp;</h1><h1>Potential&nbsp;risks or downsides</h1><p><strong>Karma is more \u201celitist\u201d</strong>: The new karma system gives greater weight to the votes of those with high karma. We think that this will overall improve the karma system: to maintain high discussion standards, it is useful to give top contributors a bigger say in determining what content is good than someone who has just created an account. Current high-karma users represent a variety of different worldviews.</p><p><strong>SEO disadvantages</strong>: While we will make every effort to ensure we follow <a href=\"https://support.google.com/webmasters/answer/34437?hl=en&amp;ref_topic=6029673\">good practices</a> for moving a website to a new domain, there\u2019s some chance that the domain change could cause us to lose PageRank (though it might also increase due to being associated with effectivealtruism.org, which is highly ranked).</p><p><strong>Too many newcomers</strong>: If the Forum does increase its rank in searches, or if more people link to the forum, there might be an influx of newcomers, leading to an \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_September\">eternal september</a>\u201d effect.</p><p>We want to ensure that the Forum remains a place for more advanced discussion. Therefore at least initially, we will not link to the Forum prominently. Once the standards of discussion are solid, we will gradually begin to link to the Forum more prominently: karma and moderation should ensure that the best content is highlighted, and lower-quality comments lose prominence. We will monitor how this changes discussion on the Forum. However, we think that exposing newcomers to high quality content, allowing them to contribute, and giving them feedback on their contributions could be an excellent way for them to improve their understanding, and become more involved in the community. We think that the benefits of this way of onboarding new community members will likely outweigh the costs.</p><p><strong>Availability of older content</strong>: Existing Forum posts and comments will continue to be available. It will still be possible to comment on old posts.</p><p><strong>Broken links</strong>: We will ensure that links to old Forum posts and comments redirect to the appropriate places on the updated site.</p><p><strong>Sequence selection and moderation</strong>: CEA will have two staff as moderators of the Forum, which will give us more control over which posts and sequences are promoted (e.g. on the front page). Although <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/ceas-current-thinking\">CEA has a view</a> on which causes we should prioritize, we recognize that the EA Forum is a community space that should reflect the community. We will moderate based on agreed standards, which will be focused on ensuring good discussion rather than any particular conclusions. We will publish our moderation and curation plans for feedback, and we encourage you to hold us to those public standards. &nbsp;</p><h1>&nbsp;</h1><h1>What comes next</h1><p>We are already testing a closed beta among CEA staff, to give CEA\u2019s development team time to iron out bugs and familiarize themselves with the codebase, and the moderation team to experiment with the new moderation features.</p><p>In mid-August, we hope to have a semi-public beta of top Forum contributors, which we will gradually open to more users. Around this time, we aim to share our detailed moderation plans in order to seek feedback.</p><p>If all goes well, we hope to lock the current Forum (i.e. prevent new posts), and switch to the new Forum by late August/early September. Some time after that, all old content and karma will be transferred to the new domain.</p><p>Longer-term, besides the above-mentioned subforums and local groups sections, we are still considering a Single Sign On system with EffectiveAltruism.org (currently used by EA Funds and the Giving What We Can pledge), more design changes, and working with the LessWrong team to implement new features that both codebases can benefit from, or (if appropriate) building new features specific to the EA Forum.</p><p>Importantly, we want Forum users to have a say in how this develops. We\u2019d welcome pointers to considerations we\u2019ve missed, or feedback on any part of our plans.</p><p>Thanks,</p><p>Marek, Max, Sam, Julia &amp; JP</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "MarekDuda"}}, {"_id": "3poYR8mXfcr9YM34Z", "title": "New research on effective climate charities", "postedAt": "2018-07-11T13:51:23.354Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>Founders Pledge has recently completed a large report on climate change, which recommends two new cost-effective climate change charities - the <a href=\"http://catf.us/\">Clean Air Task Force</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rainforestcoalition.org/\">Coalition for Rainforest Nations</a>.

At its most efficient, the market offers investment options along this risk/reward frontier. &#xA0;Individuals try to find investments offering greater rewards given risks</li>\n<li>The &#x2018;reward&#x2019; aspect of an investment, is actually an expense on the asset itself. &#xA0;The asset is paying you to use your money. There is plenty of nuance as you consider derivative value, but I&#x2019;m pretty sure this is a fundamental truth</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Apply these two concepts to impact investing. &#xA0;Give an investor a choice between a traditional investment and an impact investment, with exactly the same risk and reward. In this example, let&#x2019;s talk about bonds.</p>\n<p>Coal company ($1000): 5% interest *&#xA0;1% risk of default = $49.50 expected return</p>\n<p>Solar company ($1000): 5% interest * 1% risk of default = $49.50 expected return</p>\n<p>To an investor who doesn&#x2019;t care about non-monetary utilities, these investments are interchangeable. &#xA0;To an EA, it looks more like this:</p>\n<p>Coal company ($1000): 5% interest * 1% risk of default <strong>- $10</strong> environmental damage = <strong>$39.50</strong> expected return</p>\n<p>Solar company ($1000): 5% interest * 1% risk of default <strong>+ $5</strong> utility of clean energy capabilities = <strong>$54.50</strong> expected return</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;m still new to EA, so those estimates of energy utility are based off of nothing, but serve to illustrate the point. &#xA0;Any investor comparing the total benefits from either investment, should prefer to buy the solar bonds over the coal bonds.</p>\n<p>If the solar company needed to raise $40M, they will be paying out $2M in interest, same as the coal company. &#xA0;Do they need to? In an efficient market (that considers all utility), they could theoretically lower their interest rate until the expected total return equaled that of the market.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The investor receives less financial benefit, but the same social utility</li>\n<li>The company is able to fund itself for less</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This relationship implies that impact investments should always offer a lower financial expected value inverse to the social utility it provides. &#xA0;An investor could always invest in the coal company, then donate their earnings to their favourite AI safety project. &#xA0;<em>Is there any benefit to combining financial with social outcomes in the capital markets?</em></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>The Inefficient Real World</h2>\n<p>The real world is filled with uncertainty, and true risks, rewards, and external utilities are all difficult to measure. &#xA0;Neither companies nor investors will assess these influences the same, which creates opportunities.</p>\n<p>Since valuation of social utility is something that EAs do really well, I suspect we should be able to identify some outstanding opportunities to earn a greater return relative to an under-valued social utility, while avoiding sectors that have already discounted the financial return relative to an over-valued social utility.</p>\n<p>In my initial exploration of this space, there seem to be huge disparities between investment opportunities. &#xA0;It seems that most investors don&#x2019;t count the social good side of the equation, leading to great investments offering the same returns as traditional investments, while also generating great social utility. <em>&#xA0;Is the overall utility high enough to compete with other EA causes? &#xA0;If you&#x2019;ve got capital sitting around, are impact investments better than index funds?</em></p>\n<p>Lets zoom in.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>The Impact Investing Space</h2>\n<p>Almost all activity in the impact space is done by large institutional investors (fund managers, 67%), and foundations (11%). 37 of the 208 investors surveyed by GIIN had over a half billion dollars invested. &#xA0;Many of the private debt or equity offerings are available to accredited investors too, which means you are welcome to play if you&#x2019;ve got $1M in the bank, or a salary of $200k plus.</p>\n<p>Sadly, that criteria disqualifies me, but didn&#x2019;t stop me from checking out the options available to these larger fish. &#xA0;ImpactBase.org has a great listing of 446 impact funds that invest in particular areas. Investors here have to decide between:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Risk-adjusted market returns (371 funds) or Below-market returns (83)</li>\n<li>Impact area: eg: Basic services, Environmental, Access to Finance, etc</li>\n<li>Asset class: Private Equity (288), Fixed Income (130), Real Assets (97) or others</li>\n<li>Geographic region</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Most investment options here have minimum investment requirements with 5 or 6 zeros. &#xA0;Consider the ThirdWay Africa Impact Fund, seeking to raise 150M towards funding the creation of self sustaining businesses in African communities. &#xA0;The minimum buy-in is $2M, and the average investor has put in $15M. This fund targets the same rate of return as similar-risk assets in the market.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Small Fish Investment Options</h2>\n<p>Let&#x2019;s ignore the big kids for a minute. &#xA0;What kind of investments are available to someone who isn&#x2019;t a millionaire?</p>\n<p>A quick google search reveals many public funds for &#x2018;social responsibility&#x2019;. &#xA0;You can invest in companies or funds with lower than average carbon emissions, good track records with human rights, or even only female CEOs. &#xA0;Many large financial institutions offer these products, including RBC, Wealthsimple, and Vanguard. The problem is, they aren&#x2019;t impact investments. &#xA0;There isn&apos;t really a measurable social good created, just an assurance that they aren&#x2019;t doing bad to the world.</p>\n<p>For true impact investment options, I found two sources for Canadians:</p>\n<p><strong>1. The <a title=\"SVX\" href=\"https://www.svx.ca/\">SVX</a> Social Venture Connection</strong>, a stock market of sorts that lets you invest directly into Canadian companies with a social impact. &#xA0;This was created in 2013 by the MaRS Center for Impact Investing, the TSX (Toronto Stock Exchange), and the Canadian government among others. &#xA0;As of this writing, there are 3 options on it:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A 5%, 5 year <a title=\"SolarShare\" href=\"https://www.solarbonds.ca/\">solar bond</a>, putting renewable energy into the electrical grid</li>\n<li>A bond to start a <a title=\"42 Carden\" href=\"https://10carden.ca/accessibility-expansion/\">social community</a> in Guelph, ON</li>\n<li><a title=\"World Tree\" href=\"http://worldtreecop.com\">World Tree</a>, a company with a potential 23% annual return that offsets a lifetime carbon footprint with a $2,500 investment</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>2.&#xA0;<a title=\"OpenImpact\" href=\"http://www.openimpact.ca/products-table-view/\">OpenImpact</a></strong>, a website that lists impact investment options, but doesn&#x2019;t help facilitate the investment. &#xA0;Of the 46 open investments, just 17 are open to retail investors (an average person). Of those options, none looked particularly enticing to me</p>\n<p>I think it&#x2019;s also worth mentioning that there is an impact investing consultancy in Toronto called <a title=\"GoodInvesting\" href=\"https://www.goodinvesting.com/\">GoodInvesting</a>, that offers to help find the right impact investments for you (for a price). &#xA0;I&#x2019;ve got a consultation with them next week to learn more.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>An interesting investment option</h2>\n<p>I posted in an earlier thread about my current favourite option - World Tree. &#xA0;I think it is simply a very cool, impactful investment, offering a high enough return to find a niche in my portfolio.</p>\n<p>World Tree plants acres of Empress Splendens (non-invasive trees of the Paulownia family) to sequester carbon and later sell the wood for a profit.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Buy in is $2,500 per acre</li>\n<li>You see no return until the trees reach maturity and are harvested 10 years later</li>\n<li>The farmer keeps 50% of the profit, and you split the remaining profit with World Tree 50/50</li>\n<li>The trees regrow up to seven times, continuing to sequester carbon, provide sustainable lumber, and support farmers (they keep 100% of profits after the first harvest)</li>\n<li>I&#x2019;ve calculated the return to be 23% based of a $3/board foot lumber price. &#xA0;The current price is about $7, and the trend is rising</li>\n<li>This is a risky investment with no proven business model, no existing North American market for the wood, and one could totally lose their entire investment. &#xA0;Discount the expected value accordingly</li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, from an ecological perspective, it seems very promising too:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Average carbon offset programs cost about $10/tonne of CO2 removed</li>\n<li><a title=\"Cool Earth\" href=\"https://www.coolearth.org/\">Cool Earth </a>is one of the best programs, and was estimated to operate at $1.34/tonne<sup>5</sup></li>\n<li>World Tree appears to operate at $1.76/tonne - this is using numbers from their website</li>\n<li>One acre of 140 trees should sequester enough carbon to offset one&#x2019;s lifetime carbon footprint</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Disclaimer: I&#x2019;m not recommending this as an investment, but if it is legit, it seems like a very interesting model for impact investing.</em></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;d love to see a world with lots of high impact investment options, accessible by the masses.&#xA0; When comparing the current offering of impact investments against some of the best charities, they seem to fall short.&#xA0; But when comparing them against current financial options, there are more than a few that look like worthy additions to a portfolio.&#xA0; This brings me back to the initial question of donate now or invest now, donate later.&#xA0; What do you think?</p>\n<p><em>Please share your thoughts in the comments - especially if you found some cool investments, or are interested in investing in general!</em></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Footnotes:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/timing-of-philanthropy/\">https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/timing-of-philanthropy/</a></li>\n<li>GIIN: <a href=\"https://thegiin.org/impact-investing/need-to-know/#what-is-impact-investing\">https://thegiin.org/impact-investing/need-to-know/#what-is-impact-investing</a></li>\n<li>GIIN 2017 Annual Survey:. <a href=\"https://thegiin.org/assets/2017%20Survey%201%20Pager.pdf\">https://thegiin.org/assets/2017%20Survey%201%20Pager.pdf</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/323928/global-assets-under-management/\">https://www.statista.com/statistics/323928/global-assets-under-management/</a></li>\n<li>Giving What We Can on CoolEarth: <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/report/cool-earth/\">https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/report/cool-earth/</a></li>\n</ol></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Naryan"}}, {"_id": "io6yLz6GtF6kvXt99", "title": "Ideas for Improving Funding for Individual EAs, EA Projects, and New EA Organizations", "postedAt": "2018-07-10T06:12:29.993Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><h2>Background</h2>\n<p>Shortly after the first EA Tech Initiatives video call this past weekend, I started thinking about a lot of observations I&#x2019;ve had over the years about useful EA projects not getting funded or facing funding constraints. Several years ago I thought the EA community was highly funding constrained due to these observations. My updated model is that large organizations have significant funding available (for instance, via large Open Philanthropy Project grants), but projects/grants/startups are highly funding constrained, due to the fact that there are no centralized efforts to fund them, and also no promotion of or culture of funding smaller initiatives.</p>\n<p>In thinking about funding for EA causes, I created a 2x2 funding grid with &#x201C;organizations&#x201D; and &#x201C;individuals&#x201D; on one axis, and &#x201C;existing&#x201D; and &#x201C;new&#x201D; on the other axis. It looks like funding &#x201C;existing organizations&#x201D; and &#x201C;new individuals&#x201D; joining the movement gets a lot of funding, but funding &#x201C;new organizations&#x201D; and improving the efficacy of &#x201C;existing individuals&#x201D; in EA gets&#xA0;significantly less funding. It could be worth exploring these two neglected funding areas further.</p>\n<p>I generated a lot of ideas before I went online and realized that other EAs have already been discussing the need for better project/grant funding in considerable detail, with <a href=\"/ea/1n6/should_there_be_an_ea_crowdfunding_platform/\">this</a> appearing as one of the more recent posts in response to <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/1722174211172262/\">this</a> Facebook thread on the main EA Facebook group.</p>\n<p>The following are three ideas to tackle EA project funding in order of most decentralized to least decentralized, followed by&#xA0;a&#xA0;proposed structure for scaling small grants to EAs.&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Idea 1: Kickstarter for EA Grant Opportunities</h2>\n<p>This idea aims to fix the discoverability problem by publicly listing all EA grant opportunities that are currently requesting funding so that donors can view, communicate with, and fund grant proposals that would otherwise not be known to most donors. The EA Forum does not appear to be a place for hundreds of people to&#xA0;post funding requests en masse, and I&#x2019;m not sure what other&#xA0;medium&#xA0;could be used. My understanding is that most small scale funding is currently done on an informal, interpersonal basis which highly limits the ease and availability of funding.</p>\n<p>This platform may run into problems Kickstarter faces regarding problems with lowered project discoverability as a large number of projects get added to the platform, quality control issues/projects being poorly executed, and problems that arise from not having centralized due diligence (anything from outright scams to projects that simply did not realistically have the ability to execute even after meeting funding goals many times over). There is likely a good reason why Indiegogo&#x2019;s equity crowdfunding system uses Microventures to screen all offerings before they are posted online with an acceptance rate of under 5%, otherwise a lot of scams and projects with low execution capacity could be posted, making the platform unusable for making good investments without investors committing a lot of their time in due diligence.</p>\n<h2>Idea 2: Distributed Grantmakers</h2>\n<p>I met someone at EA Global 2018 who is heavily involved in the AI safety space. This person mentioned they were familiar with opportunities to make small high impact grants in AI safety, and were considering using their own money to make these grants, but obviously the amount of available capital for self-financed grants is very limited despite the number of and needs of the grantees. This made me realize that as a donor, I would be very poorly equipped to judge project areas like AI safety which interest me but are outside my area of expertise. If I were to make grants in AI safety, I would want someone like the person I met guiding my donation, not only because they are subject matter experts but also because they are&#xA0;very familiar with small grant opportunities that I would never become aware of because I don&#x2019;t do direct work in the field and am not networked with hundreds of people in the field.</p>\n<p>Two problems with EA Grants are apparent&#xA0;in&#xA0;this September 2017 <a href=\"/ea/1fc/effective_altruism_grants_project_update/\">post</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Problem&#xA0;1: Evaluating any project is challenging without domain expertise in the project&apos;s&#xA0;area(s)</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We found it hard to make decisions on first-round applications that looked potentially promising but were outside of our in-house expertise. Many applicants had proposals for studies and charities we felt under-qualified to assess. Most of those applicants we turned down; some we deferred to the relevant Open Phil program manager. We are in the process of establishing relationships with domain experts who can help us do this in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><strong>Problem 2: A consolidated project evaluation process takes a lot of time and effort</strong></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We then went through the list by rank and chose applicants to interview, discussing applicants about which there was large divergence in scores or general opinion. Given our &#xA3;500,000 budget and most of three staff members&#x2019; time for two weeks, we decided to interview 63 candidates.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Both of these problems could be eliminated by transitioning away from a model where a very small number of people attempt to evaluate a very large&#xA0;number of projects they do not have any expertise in, to a model oriented around empowering people with existing subject matter expertise and existing knowledge of grant opportunities in their space to give grants to support those opportunities instead of&#xA0;not taking action.</p>\n<p>This proposal could run into difficulties with the quality of distributed grantmakers, although a grantmaker evaluation process would be at least an order of magnitude less work than evaluating all of the projects themselves. This proposal could cause a bias towards funding projects that grantmakers are already familiar with, which could exclude many projects from consideration. And of course there are issues like conflicts of interest&#xA0;with grantmakers and grantees or even with the grantmaker&apos;s own projects, feeling obligated to donate to one&#x2019;s contacts for social reasons even if the idea is poor, and facilitating the entire distributed grantmaking system itself.</p>\n<h2>Idea 3: Large-Scale Centralized Grantmaking</h2>\n<p>This idea is most similar to EA Grants, but in the form of a separate organization with a robust grantmaking team.</p>\n<p>Due to the&#xA0;current scale of EA Grants,&#xA0;people who write grant applications are not being catered to optimally, and this could be a great reason to fund a separate organization exclusively for the purpose of facilitating grants to smaller initiatives. Rather than have CEA team members work part time on giving grants throughout the year and then switch back to their&#xA0;main area of work, dedicated, specialized grantmaking staff should be hired so that disparate grants can be reviewed by someone with an appropriate background, grantmaking can happen throughout the year, a high number of grants can be assessed, and the project can scale quickly and effectively if needed. Hopefully, having dedicated grantmaking staff means better grants over time&#xA0;as the&#xA0;staff becomes more experienced. Edit: CEA&#xA0;is <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/careers/ea-grants-evaluator-full-time/\">hiring</a> a full-time grants evaluator, so they&#xA0;appear to be&#xA0;moving in&#xA0;this direction.</p>\n<p>Right now, EA Grants is not equipped to do things like give funding to for-profit EA&#xA0;initiatives or fund things like educational expenses. Setting up a new organization with the capacity to do tax-deductible grants, non-tax-deductible grants, and equity/bond impact investments could greatly help with getting different types of projects and activities off the ground.</p>\n<p>This proposal has concerns around concentrating&#xA0;grantmaking among very few people, the possibility of insufficient transparency when making grants, and issues about the amount of resources it would take to run such an organization compared to less centralized solutions.</p>\n<h2>Concept Proposal: Fusing All Three Ideas to Maximize Information Sharing, Grantmaking Efficiency, and Ease of Funding</h2>\n<p>I think that elements of all three ideas are beneficial and could be included in a more optimal solution for scaling grantmaking. My proposed concept is inspired by how real world venture funds operate, with a few key differences.</p>\n<p>The concept starts with a website that has a fully digital grant application process. Applicants create user accounts that let them edit applications, and applicants can choose from a variety of options like having the grant be&#xA0;hidden or publicly displayed on the website, and posting under their real names or a pseudonym. Grants have discussions sections for the public to give feedback. Anonymous project submission help people get feedback without&#xA0;reputation risk&#xA0;and judge project funding potential before committing significant time and resources to a project.</p>\n<p>If the applicant&#xA0;opts to make an application public, it is displayed for everyone to see and comment on. Anyone can contact the project creator, have a public or private discussion on the grant website, and even fund a project directly.</p>\n<p>The website is backed by a centralized organization that decides which proposals to fund via distributed grantmaking. Several part-time or full-time team members run the organization and assess the quality and performance of grantmakers. EAs in different cause areas can apply to be grantmakers. After an initial evaluation process, beginner grantmakers are given a role like &#x201C;grant advisor&#x201D; and given a small grantmaking budget. As grantmakers prove themselves effective, they are given higher roles and a larger grantmaking budget.</p>\n<p><strong>While powered by dencentralized grantmakers, the organization has centralized funding options for donors that do not want to evaluate grants themselves. Donations can be tax-deductible, non-tax-deductible, or even structured as impact investments into EA initiatives. Donors can choose cause areas to fund, and can perhaps even fund individual grantmakers.</strong></p>\n<p>This model greatly increases awareness for grant opportunities in all areas across effective altruism. It makes it possible for grantees to seek funding from many sources in a centralized location, and for donors to&#xA0;choose their own grants if they&#xA0;want instead of relying on something like EA Grants to make the right grant decisions. Via decentralized grantmaking, this model makes it so that large amounts of funding can be shuttled to giving small grants, with higher average&#xA0;evaluator subject matter expertise and lower evaluator time commitment per grant&#xA0;compared to EA Grants.</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Hopefully this post&#xA0;inspires additional thoughts, and more importantly, actions in the area of&#xA0;facilitating additional funding towards grants to EAs, EA projects, and new nonprofit and for-profit EA organizations.</p>\n<p>If feedback for this grantmaking idea is sufficiently positive, I am interested in spending time making this idea a reality. Otherwise, hopefully this post provides useful ideas for future grantmaking organizations and programs to consider.</p>\n<h2>Update</h2>\n<p>Based on&#xA0;this post&apos;s comments, it seems like further discussion and coordination around improving grantmaking within EA would be beneficial. I&apos;ve created the #ti-funding channel within Rethink Charity&apos;s Slack team to promote greater discussion and coordination around this topic. Further updates to come.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Brendon_Wong"}}, {"_id": "6DPSFPoQXrXrjSvgS", "title": "Open Thread #40", "postedAt": "2018-07-08T17:51:47.777Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><a href=\"/ea/1fx/open_thread_39/\">The last Open Thread was in October 2017</a>, so I thought we were overdue for a new one.</p>\n<p>Use this thread to post things that are awesome, but not awesome enough to be full posts.

Thus, I suspect most of the utility from this post comes from alerting EAs, individually and collectively, to this opportunity and the <em>prima facie</em> reasons for thinking it could be effective, rather than from concrete advice on entering this area.</p>\n<h1>Brief and Idealized Introduction to CBA Generally&#xA0;</h1>\n<p>CBA is a formal analytical technique for evaluating proposed regulations. Ideally (though not always in practice), CBA considers first identifies all expected costs and benefits. For hard-to-quantify (e.g., non-market) values, CBA can use a variety of techniques of varying quality, including <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contingent_valuation\">contingent evaluation</a> and break-even analysis. The analyst then monetizes these inputs, discounts future values, and arrives at net present value (NPV) for the regulation(s). Regulators then, ideally, choose the regulation with the highest NPV or, if no positive-NPV regulation exists, refrain from regulating.</p>\n<h1>CBA in the US Government</h1>\n<h2>The Long Version</h2>\n<p><em>This section contains a brief&#x2014;but still technical&#x2014;overview of how the US Government (&quot;USG&quot;) uses CBA in the regulatory process. It might not be interesting for people who want to quickly ascertain whether this career path is worth further personal exploration. Still, it usefully contextualizes the CBA process and how it shapes US regulation.</em>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The first major relevant document is <a href=\"https://www.archives.gov/files/federal-register/executive-orders/pdf/12866.pdf\">Executive Order 12866</a>, promulgated October 4, 1993. It is usefully summarized <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-executive-order-12866-regulatory-planning-and-review\">here</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#xA0;[E.O. 12866] provides that significant regulatory actions be submitted for review to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) in the [White House] Office of Management and Budget (OMB). A &quot;significant regulatory action,&quot; as defined by the E.O., generally is any regulatory action that is likely to result in a rule that may:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy, a sector of the economy, productivity, competition, jobs, the environment, public health or safety, or State, local, or tribal governments or communities;</li>\n<li>Create a serious inconsistency or otherwise interfere with an action taken or planned by another agency;</li>\n<li>Materially alter the budgetary impact of entitlements, grants, user fees, or loan programs or the rights and obligations of recipients thereof; or</li>\n<li>Raise novel legal or policy issues arising out of legal mandates, the President&apos;s priorities, or the principles set forth in this Executive order.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After Federal Register publication of such an action, the E.O. provides that the federal agency promulgating the action and OMB make available to the public the documents exchanged between them during the review. The federal agency must identify any substantive changes between the draft submitted to OMB and the published rule and must identify those changes made at the suggestion or recommendation of OMB.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The next relevant document is Executive Order&#xA0;13563. From the same page (emphasis added):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[E.O.13563] reaffirms and amplifies the principles embodied in E.O. 12866 by encouraging agencies to coordinate their regulatory activities, and to consider regulatory approaches that reduce the burden of regulation while maintaining flexibility and freedom of choice for the public.&#xA0; It directs agencies to, where feasible and appropriate, seek the views of those likely to be affected by a proposed rulemaking before a notice of proposed rulemaking is issued.&#xA0; <em>E.O 13563 requires agencies to quantify anticipated benefits and costs of proposed rulemakings as accurately as possible using the best available techniques, and to ensure that any scientific and technological information or processes used to support their regulatory actions are objective</em>.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>To the extent feasible and permitted by law, E.O. 13563 also directs agencies to provide timely online access to the rulemaking docket for proposed and final rules, along with any relevant scientific and technical findings, on regulations.gov, and to afford the public the opportunity to comment on proposed regulations through the Internet.&#xA0; With regard to existing regulations, E.O. 13563 instructs agencies to periodically review their significant regulations with the goal of making their regulatory programs more effective or less burdensome.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>President Obama issued an <a href=\"https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/07/11/executive-order-13579-regulation-and-independent-regulatory-agencies\">Executive Order (13579) to similar effect</a>&#xA0;in 2011.</p>\n<p>Quoting from <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/whitehouse.gov/files/omb/circulars/A4/a-4.pdf\">Circular A-4</a>, which &quot;provides the Office of Management and Budget&#x2019;s (OMB&apos;s) guidance to Federal agencies on the development of regulatory analysis as required under&#xA0;. . . Executive Order 12866&quot;:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Before recommending Federal regulatory action, an agency must demonstrate that the proposed action is necessary. If the regulatory intervention results from a statutory or judicial directive, you should describe the specific authority for your action, the extent of discretion available to you, and the regulatory instruments you might use. Executive Order 12866 states that &quot;Federal agencies should promulgate only such regulations as are required by law, are necessary to interpret the law, or are made necessary by compelling need, such as material&#xA0;failures of private markets to protect or improve the health and safety of the public, the environment, or the well being of the American people . . . .&quot;</p>\n<p>Executive Order 12866 also states that &quot;Each agency shall identify the problem that it intends to address (including, where applicable, the failures of private markets or public institutions that warrant new agency action) as well as assess the significance of that problem.&quot; Thus, you should try to explain whether the action is intended to address a significant market failure or to meet some other compelling public need such as improving governmental processes or promoting intangible values such as distributional fairness or privacy. If the regulation is designed to correct a significant market failure, you should describe the failure both qualitatively and (where feasible) quantitatively. You should show that a government intervention is likely to do more good than harm. For other interventions, you should also provide a demonstration of compelling social purpose and the likelihood of effective action. Although intangible rationales do not need to be quantified, the analysis should present and evaluate the strengths and limitations of the relevant arguments for these intangible values.<sup>1</sup></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The above apply to executive agencies. Some independent agencies, like the EPA and SEC, are also statutorily obligated to perform CBA before promulgating rules.<sup>2</sup></p>\n<h2>TL;DR</h2>\n<p>By executive order and sometimes statute, US regulators have to perform CBA, supported by the best objective evidence, before promulgating major regulations. They should promulgate regulations only for good reason (e.g., a market failure).&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Impact</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://hls.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/10871/Sunstein\">Cass Sunstein</a>&#xA0;worked as OIRA Administrator from 2009&#x2013;2012 (and <a href=\"https://www.eaglobal.org/speakers/cass-sunstein/\">spoke at EAG 2016</a>). While there, he &quot;help[ed] oversee the issuance of over 2,000 regulatory actions.&quot;<sup>3</sup>&#xA0;He reports that &quot;the net benefits of economically significant regulations under President Obama[&apos;s first three years in office] exceeded $91 billion . . . Indeed, those benefits rose to $159 billion for the first four years.&quot;<sup>4</sup></p>\n<p>Using <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/draft_2017_cost_benefit_report.pdf\">a more recent estimate,</a>&#xA0;OIRA estimates that the net social benefits of the 16 major rules agencies promulgated in 2016 at between 11.4 and 31.5 billion USD.<sup>5</sup></p>\n<p><strong>This suggests an enormous opportunity for impact</strong>.</p>\n<h1>Why EAs Should Consider Working in CBA</h1>\n<h2>1. Opportunity for Direct Impact</h2>\n<p>As mentioned immediately above, CBA seems to create enormous social value. To ascertain whether this option is competitive with other EA career paths, I will perform a&#xA0;very preliminary estimate&#xA0;of the potential for direct impact from simply being a <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/policy-oriented-civil-service-uk/#but-you-need-to-be-better-than-other-marginal-civil-servants\">better-than-replacement</a> analyst with OIRA (with a reminder that I lack actual experience inside OIRA):</p>\n<p>Suppose that by working as a junior regulatory analyst at OIRA, you have a counterfactual impact that causes federal CBA to improve by 0.1% for one year (i.e., you cause federal CBA to create 0.1% more net social value). You should therefore expect your impact to be&#xA0;between 11.4 and 31.5 million USD.</p>\n<p>Although these might seem like large amounts, CBA is probably not competitive with other options on these grounds alone. For example, the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/environmental-economics/mortality-risk-valuation#whatvalue\">EPA values a statistical American life at $7.4 million</a>. So, this estimate means that your impact is approximately beneficially equivalent to averting 1.54 and 4.26 American deaths. Presumably, EAs can achieve the same or better impact in other ways.</p>\n<p>Of course, this calculation depends on a largely arbitrary impact estimate (0.1%) on my behalf. If one is skeptical of this figure, as you should be, I encourage you to practice a bit of CBA and perform breakeven analysis to see how impactful you would need to be to make this competitive with your other options. Simply solve for <em>I</em>, where&#xA0;<em>N</em>&#xA0;a value equal to the number of American-statistical-life-equivalents you believe you can achieve over a year in your next-best job option:<br><br><u>Upper Bound</u>: <em>I</em> * [($31.5 x 10<sup>9</sup>)/($7.4 x 10<sup>6</sup>)] =&#xA0;<em>N</em></p>\n<p><span>Lower Bound</span>:&#xA0;<em>I</em>&#xA0;* [($11.4 x 10<sup>9</sup>)/($7.4 x 10<sup>6</sup>)] =&#xA0;<em>N</em></p>\n<p>If&#xA0;<em>I</em> seems plausible, then CBA is competitive in direct impact.</p>\n<p>It might be worth also considering working in CBA in other jurisdictions. Although the USG probably has the greatest regulatory impact of any regulator, its CBA apparatus is well-developed, so there might be lower-hanging fruit in other jurisdictions.&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>2. Opportunity&#xA0;for Structural Change</h2>\n<p>CBA, as currently practiced, suffers from a number of flaws. Practical&#xA0;problems include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Infrequent <a href=\"https://www.acus.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Aldy%2520Retro%2520Review%2520Draft%252011-17-2014.pdf\">retrospective reviews of regulations</a></li>\n<li>Incomplete quantification of costs and benefits</li>\n<li>Under President Trump, <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/evaluatingtrumpregreform_gayerlitanwallach_102017.pdf\">more focus on gross costs than net benefits</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Ethical flaws include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus solely on American citizens and residents (to the exclusion of animals and non-Americans)<sup>6</sup></li>\n<li>High discounting rates<sup>7</sup></li>\n<li>Qualitative-only accounting for distributional effects</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Fixing these problems (and identifying others) can plausibly improve the ethical alignment of CBA, and thereby create much more social value. The calculus of this, of course,&#xA0;is similar to that above. However, as compared to direct work, structural changes to CBA are likely to last longer and impact more regulations. Thus, structural improvements to CBA are probably orders of magnitude more impactful than direct work.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Admittedly, drastic changes like fully quantifying impact on animals or non-Americans are unlikely in the near future; they&apos;re outside the Overton Window. They&apos;re also set at levels higher than junior analysts. But perhaps even <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/policy-oriented-civil-service-uk/#civil-servants-can-influence-the-government\">junior analysts could incrementally improve ethical alignment</a> on these issues from within OIRA or agencies.</p>\n<p>This analysis accords well with the priority 80,000 Hours gives to <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/improving-institutional-decision-making/\">improving institutional decision-making</a> and <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/policy-oriented-civil-service-uk/\">policy-oriented civil-service</a>. Indeed, perhaps CBA is best conceptualized as a special instance of those.</p>\n<h2>3. Builds Career Capital for Politics</h2>\n<p>Working in CBA seems likely to be useful in building career capital for a number of priority career paths, such as&#xA0;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/policy-oriented-civil-service-uk/#civil-servants-can-influence-the-government\">policymaking</a>, <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/congressional-staffer/\">congressional politics</a>, <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/party-politics-uk/\">party politics</a>, and/or <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/think-tank-research/\">think-tank research</a>. It seems likely to be robustly useful across these domains, as analysts presumably become familiar with broadly useful analytical techniques, work at a well-respected institution, and gain professional connections with policymakers. And, of course, additional career capital within CBA makes it easier to effect the structural improvements to CBA mentioned in the previous subsection (e.g., by being promoted, by having one&apos;s viewpoint respected, by being able to offer more credible critiques of the system).</p>\n<h2>4. High Bi-Directional Skill Transferability within EA</h2>\n<p>Analysts likely build skills that are useful to EA as a movement. Of course, CBA and closely related ideas are central to EA. Thus, gaining knowledge in CBA seems useful to <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/working-at-effective-altruist-organisations/\">EA work</a>. For example, I imagine that working in CBA will help develop the following <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2017/11/talent-gaps-survey-2017/#what-kinds-of-talent-do-we-need-more-of\">needed skills in EA</a>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Good calibration, wide knowledge and ability to work out what&apos;s important</li>\n<li>Generalist researcher skills</li>\n<li>Government and policy expertise</li>\n<li>Economics</li>\n<li>Other math, quant or stats expertise</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I imagine (though, again, lack direct confirmation) that CBA experience would also be useful for&#xA0;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/foundation-program-manager/\">foundation grantmakers</a>, <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/economics-phd/\">economics PhDs</a>, or <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/global-priorities-research/\">global priorities research</a>.</p>\n<p>Conversely, many EAs are already likely familiar with core ideas of CBA, since our movement relies on them. This suggests that EAs and rationalists may be a good fit for CBA roles.</p>\n<p>The high degree of skill transferability between CBA and adjacent EA domains suggests that CBA has important skill-building and option value.</p>\n<h1>Entry</h1>\n<p>A <a href=\"https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/490219400\">(now-closed) job announcement&#xA0;for a CBA analyst in OIRA</a>, posted earlier this year, lists the following as the qualifications:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A.

We&#x2019;ve spent the last year refining and extending our tool (<a href=\"https://www.positly.com\">Positly</a>) to help researchers recruit and manage relevant study participants. Now we&#x2019;re opening it up to external researchers while we continue to improve and transform this platform to make a big difference.</p>\n<p>Our mission at <a href=\"https://www.positly.com\">Positly</a> is to dramatically improve the speed, quality and affordability of social science, product, and human subject research.</p>\n<h3>Early feedback from our amazing beta testers has been validating that we&#x2019;re on track towards that goal. Here are just a few things they&#x2019;ve said:</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>&#x201C;I had to run a dozen small online experiments in a few months to finish my dissertation. With Positly, each study took less than 5 minutes to launch and I always got my data on the same day.&#x201D; &#x2013;&#xA0;<a href=\"https://tltl.stanford.edu/people/daniel-greene\">Daniel Greene</a>, doctoral candidate, <a href=\"https://ed.stanford.edu/academics/doctoral/lstd\">Stanford University Graduate School of Education</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>&quot;I loved using Positly.

Our team is focused on using quality data and solid reasoning to make decisions so that we could deepen our understanding of psychology through rapid, high quality research studies. This is something that aligns very well with the EA community. We&#x2019;ve already worked with many people in the EA community and we want to keep expanding our collaboration.</p>\n<p>Right now we want to help EA organisations conduct research, help EA founders build successful companies (by conducting high quality research studies on their target markets), and help individual researchers focus on their core work instead of fussing around with recruiting and managing participants.</p>\n<h1>Use cases for Positly</h1>\n<h3>Here&#x2019;s a few example of use cases relevant to Effective Altruism that we&#x2019;d love to see (and some we already collaborated on):</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Modelling human values (e.g. understanding the relative weights of future lives, different species etc)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Marketing and communications (e.g. communicating cause areas and EA convincingly, pre-testing blog posts or videos for movement building &#x2013;&#xA0;all with <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/blog/the-fidelity-model-of-spreading-ideas/\">high fidelity</a>)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Social science studies (e.g. <a href=\"http://priority.wiki/mental-health\">mental health</a> interventions, <a href=\"http://priority.wiki/#improving-research-decisions-and-values\">improving decision making</a>, behavioural economics choice architecture, cognitive psychology tools)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Consumer acceptance/market testing (e.g. clean/plant-based meat products, effective donation platforms)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://priority.wiki/#improving-policy\">Policy</a> research (e.g. asking people about their values around employment and meaning when facing increasing automation/intelligence explosion)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>User experience testing (e.g. launching new apps or websites)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>As we&apos;ve mentioned, we&apos;re constantly using Positly for our own studies.

Often when people hear this they think that we live like austere monks, eating nothing but rice and beans, drinking only water, and working until we drop from exhaustion. However, we actually live a very comfortable lifestyle. I think one reason for this is that we have thought strategically about how to have fun on a budget. We&#x2019;ve learned a lot from this experience and in this blog post I&#x2019;ll explain more about how we do a lot with a little.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>I hope that those who are interested can use this as a guide, thus freeing their money for more donations or taking a lower nonprofit salary. Of course, this is not a universal guide, and some people might not be in a position to do this (<a href=\"/ea/1o3/the_importance_of_ea_dedication_and_why_it_should/\">see more here</a>). This is just for people who want to have a more frugal lifestyle and still enjoy their weekends.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;ll start off by explaining the broad principles of maximizing fun per dollar with limited resources, then I&#x2019;ll give some concrete examples.</p>\n<h2>The principles of maximizing fun-per-dollar with limited resources</h2>\n<p>First of all, break down your interests. &#x201C;Fun&#x201D; is too broad of a term. There are many different sorts, and some people prefer some more than others. For example, you might be an extrovert, at which point figuring out ways to have fun that are social will be more important than if you&#x2019;re an introvert. Common goals people want their fun to fulfill are novelty, socializing, being in a different environment, being outdoors, gaining mastery, physical pleasure, and relaxing.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Once you&#x2019;ve identified your interests, brainstorm ways to achieve them. Ideally, <a href=\"/ea/14a/using_a_spreadsheet_to_make_good_decisions_five/\">make a spreadsheet</a> with a row for each idea, and add as many rows as you can. If you spend less than 30 minutes working on this, you&#x2019;re doing it wrong. Often the best ideas will come after you&#x2019;ve been stumped for 5 minutes straight. Keep going. Set a timer.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Then do the most EA thing ever - write up expected costs in one column and expected fun-hours in another column. Make a fourth column explaining how many hours of fun you get per dollar, and sort by that. Et voila! You now have massive nerd points and you&#x2019;ll be having more cost-effective fun than ever.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The systematic nature of this method isn&#x2019;t its only important feature; another is the fact that it forces you to be creative and think about your more fundamental goals. Often people default to the status quo way to achieve their ends, and this leads to massive inefficiencies. For instance, if somebody has a yearning for a pet, they&#x2019;ll often just go and adopt one. However, there are alternative options that get a lot of the same benefit for less cost, both time- and money-wise. You could foster pets, which, while free, is also helping cause more happiness in the world (if a dog isn&#x2019;t a utility monster, I don&#x2019;t know what is). You could ask your neighbors if they&#x2019;d be interested in free dog-walking. You could volunteer at a local pet shelter. In short, creativity isn&#x2019;t just for artists. It makes almost every other area of your life better.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>A side note - remember to maximize your different interests separately. If you only figure out good fun-per-dollar activities for vegging out, you&#x2019;ll often start getting niggling feelings of boredom and meaninglessness. Make sure to take care of novelty and other drives as well.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The second broad principle is to lower your big costs and not worry about the small ones. When I go grocery shopping I do not pay much attention to price. However, when I was looking for a place to rent, I was patient and looked for a good deal. At the moment I live in the most expensive city in Canada, and yet my rent is very reasonable due to this one-time restraint and strategicness. Another big cost is a car. If at all possible, choose a place to live with good public transit and live close to a hub. Metros are particularly good for getting places faster. Likewise, live close to your work. This minimizes transit costs and also leads to the third principle: minimize time spent on drudgery.</p>\n<p>You can spend money on pursuing fun, but an equally good way to make your life more enjoyable is to pay to avoid boredom and pain. For example, pay for grocery delivery. It saves you a ton of time, and unless you enjoy the process of shopping, it will free up your time for much more enjoyable activities.&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Concrete examples</h2>\n<p>So, those are the broad principles. Let&#x2019;s get into some concrete examples:&#xA0;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Use Groupon to maximize novelty</strong>. Groupon is a godsend for the frugal fun maximizer. Check out local things in your area that you&#x2019;d be keen on. In the past I&#x2019;ve gone to a cat cafe, a blind restaurant where everything was pitch black and all the servers were blind, a sensory deprivation tank, and a VR arcade. Each were things I might have done on a holiday overseas, but with Groupon I was able to do them locally for a fraction of the cost.</li>\n<li><strong>Go on local vacations.</strong> People often default to travelling far away to get their novelty kicks. However, often there are local places that serve the same purpose for much cheaper and less environmental damage. For example, there&#x2019;s a resort within one hour of Vancouver that has all of the atmosphere of being at a tropical resort, but for a fraction of the travel and living costs. There are probably such areas around most major cities.&#xA0;</li>\n<li><strong>Take initiative with friends.</strong> Often people say that they can&#x2019;t do things for cheap because their friends are always going out and doing expensive things. You can help mitigate this by being the person who organizes hangouts. If you&#x2019;re the one who takes initiative, you have more effective say over what&#x2019;s done, such as drinking at home or watching a movie on a projector. A hidden benefit is that you&#x2019;ll also find it easier to maintain friendships and socialize more, instead of just passively waiting to be invited to things.&#xA0;</li>\n<li><strong>Get a car co-op</strong>. Even if you live close to public transit or your work, there will often be times that you need a car. Many car co-ops have systems where you only pay when you use the car, so are surprisingly cost-effective if you only use them only occasionally.</li>\n<li><strong>Get Netflix from friends.</strong> This one is so well known I won&#x2019;t go into it.&#xA0;</li>\n<li><strong>Share your friends&#x2019; Steam accounts.</strong> If you play video games, ask your friends to share you on their Steam accounts. This can get you a large supply of entertainment for free with the small cost of not being able to play when they&#x2019;re online.</li>\n<li><strong>Get games on <a href=\"https://www.humblebundle.com/\">Humble Bundle</a>.</strong> Another gaming hack is get games from Humble Bundle. They bundle a new set of games once a week and you can make all of the money go to AMF, so it doesn&#x2019;t even count as entertainment spending. Just make sure to check the settings to make sure that the money actually goes to AMF instead of a different charity or the developers. They let you choose the amount that goes to each.</li>\n<li><strong>Don&#x2019;t drink out.</strong> Drink at home. Invite people over and have some drinks. Everybody will save money, it&#x2019;s a more comfortable environment, and you&#x2019;ll still have lots of fun. You can even feel more comfortable talking about controversial topics without worrying about offending nearby listeners.</li>\n<li><strong>Buy cheap alcohol.</strong> It&#x2019;s been established again and again that people can&#x2019;t tell the difference between cheap and fancy alcohol. It&#x2019;s mostly signalling. Take advantage of this and buy cheap liquor. Vodka and sugar-free pops are cheap, easy, minimize chance of hangover, and limit calorie intake compared to many alternatives.&#xA0;</li>\n<li><strong>Don&#x2019;t buy books.</strong> Use the library and the internet. Check out libgen.io or your local library.&#xA0;</li>\n<li><strong>Get a projector instead of going to the movie theater.</strong> If you&#x2019;re a big movie goer and like experiencing film on the big screen, invest in a projector. That way you can invite friends over for movie nights and save money over the long run.&#xA0;</li>\n<li><strong>Organize a friendly sports day.</strong> A lot of people in elementary and high school played sports at lunch or as part of a team. People often fall out of it as adults, but there&#x2019;s no reason to. Get some friends together and arrange a weekly soccer or other sporting event on an empty field. It costs nothing, is lots of fun, is physically active, and it&#x2019;s social. It maximizes a lot of things all at once.&#xA0;</li>\n<li><strong>Don&#x2019;t eat out.</strong> Eating out is terrible on the fun-per-dollar scale. Save that money for something better. Cook at home, but, in keeping with minimizing drudgery, if you don&#x2019;t like cooking, don&#x2019;t spend too much time on it. Bulk make things that can be frozen and reheated later (like pakoras, veggie burgers, veggie pies, burritos, etc). Look for recipes that are easy. Lots of people, especially vegans, make the mistake of learning two or three really fancy recipes to impress a date, but that take hours to make. If a recipe requires you to make your own cashew milk, ignore it! Just buy some soy milk or cashew milk, or find an easier recipe.&#xA0;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I&#x2019;m going to end on a more advanced note that can&#x2019;t be summarized well in point form. One of the most powerful, but also most difficult, ways to have fun cost-effectively is to expand the number of things you find enjoyable. I do this with meditation and gratitude, but I&#x2019;ve heard of people having success with CBT as well.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Happiness comes from external and internal factors, and if you can control the internal factors, this costs no money and can last a lifetime. However, it&#x2019;s tricky and subtle and I&#x2019;ve seen some people have far more success with it than others. I&#x2019;ll give it my best go here though within the limitations of a blog post.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Meditation <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22582738\">has a lot of evidence in its favor</a>, and in my own personal experience (I&#x2019;ve been tracking my happiness and habits for over four years now), has made an enormous difference. Meditating first thing in the morning makes you more resilient to potential stressors throughout the day, and can change your baseline of happiness, such that, if nothing in particular is happening, you are at a higher level than you would be without it. I highly recommend accompanying your practice with reading or classes. Since meditation is fundamentally hard to teach (you can&#x2019;t see what&#x2019;s going on in somebody&#x2019;s brain and correct it as a teacher), play around with different teaching resources. Some might click with you way better than others. I recommend Joy on Demand (written by a programmer and Google employee, so more rationality focused) and The Mind Illuminated (much more technical and straightforward compared to more woo-y alternatives). However, your mileage may vary. Play around with it.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Gratitude, or, more broadly, savoring, is another very potent method to enjoy more things. I say a gratitude list before bed every night after brushing my teeth, to chain together habits. I also finish my meditation each morning by listing 3 things I appreciate about my job. Additionally, it can help to, instead of comparing yourself to people who are doing better than you, compare yourself to those who are worse off. When I think about the global poor and how their lives compare to mine, I feel extremely lucky and wealthy, and a great side benefit is I feel more motivated about my job at the same time. I often feel richer than friends earning ten times my income feel.</p>\n<p>Cognitive behavioral therapy can also be a great tool, especially for getting rid of more negative thoughts. You can also proactively practice re-framing events in ways that make you enjoy them more.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;ll finish with a more philosophical approach to frugal fun. Far from feeling limited by my income, I have found, like many others, that practicing minimalism makes me feel free. I feel that since what I need to feel happy is so small, I can do anything I want. If I wanted to work on a very controversial charity idea, I would only need to fundraise a small amount.

Some considerations require you to zoom out to take an eagle-eye view across a vast landscape of possibility (e.g. to research moral uncertainty), while other considerations require you to swoop in to see the details (e.g. to welcome someone new). The <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Near/far_thinking\">distance</a> from which you're looking down at a problem is the <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2010/06/near-far-summary.html\">construal level</a> you're thinking at.</p><p>People involved in the EA community can gain a lot from improving their grasp of construal levels \u2013 the levels they or others naturally incline towards and even the level they're operating at any given moment (leading, for instance, to less disconnect in conversations). A lack of construal-level sense combined with a lack of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Seventh-Sense-Fortune-Survival-Networks/dp/1478909102\">how-to-interact-in-large-social-networks</a> sense has left a major blindspot in how we collectively make decisions, in my view.</p><p>The Values-to-Actions Decision Chain (in short: 'decision chain') is an approach for you to start solving the awe-inspiring problem of 'doing the most good' by splitting it into a series of decisions you will make from high to low construal levels (creating in effect, a <a href=\"https://www.meetconstance.com/blog/grit-ch-4\">hierarchy of goals</a>). It is also a lens through which you can more clearly see your own limits to doing this and compensate by coordinating better with others. Beware though that it\u2019s a blurry and distorted lens \u2013 this post itself is a high construal-level exercise and many important nuances have been eliminated in the process. I'd be unsurprised if I ended up revising many of the ideas and implications in here after another year of thinking.</p><h1>Chain up</h1><p>To illustrate how to use the V2ADC (see diagram below):</p><p>Suppose an ethics professor decided that...</p><ul><li>...from the point of view of the universe... <i>(</i><a href=\"https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/metaethics/\"><i>meta-ethics</i></a><i>)</i></li><li>...hedonistic utilitarianism made sense...<i> (</i><a href=\"https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/moral-theories/\"><i>moral theories</i></a><i>)</i></li><li>...and that therefore humans in developing countries should not suffer unnecessarily...<i> (</i><a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/update-cause-prioritization-open-philanthropy#Key_worldview_choices_and_why_they_might_call_for_diversification\"><i>worldview</i></a><i>)</i></li><li>...leading him to work on reducing global poverty... <i>(</i><a href=\"https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/problems-interventions-and-focus-areas/\"><i>focus area</i></a><i>)</i></li><li>...by reducing a variety of easily treatable diseases... <i>(</i><a href=\"https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/problems-interventions-and-focus-areas/\"><i>problems</i></a><i>)</i></li><li>...by advocating for citizens of rich countries to pledge 1% of their income... <i>(</i><a href=\"https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/problems-interventions-and-focus-areas/\"><i>intervention</i></a><i>)</i></li><li>...by starting a non-profit... <i>(</i><a href=\"/ea/18p/concrete_project_lists/\"><i>project</i></a><i>)</i></li><li>...where he works with a team of staff members... <i>(</i><a href=\"https://wavelength.asana.com/workstyle-establish-your-teams-workflow/\"><i>workflow</i></a><i>)</i></li><li>...to prepare his TED talk... <i>(task batches)</i></li><li>...to cover the decision to donate for guide dogs vs. treating trachoma...<i> (task)</i></li><li>...which he mentions...<i> (</i><a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/execute\"><i>execute</i></a><i>)</i></li><li><i>.</i>..by vibrating his vocal chords<i> (</i><a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/actuate\"><i>actuate</i></a><i>)&nbsp;</i><br><br>&nbsp;</li></ul><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995038/mirroredImages/Ekzvat8FbHRiPLn9Z/c0y4oitxn2nwgezgpsfz.png\"></figure><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>The Values-to-Actions Decision Chain. Note that the categorisation here is somewhat arbitrary and open to interpretation; let me know if something's unclear or should be changed (or if you disagree with the diagram on some fundamental level). Also see the headings on either side of the diagram; it could also be called the Observations-to-Epistemics Integration Chain but that's less catchy.</p><p>It should be obvious at this point that the professor isn't some lone ranger battling out to stop world suffering by himself. Along the way, the professor studies classical moral philosophers and works with an executive director, who in turn hires a website developer who creates a donation button, which a donor clicks to donate money to a malaria prevention charity, which the charity's treasurer uses to pay out the salary of a new local worker, who hands out a bednet to a mother of three children, who hangs the net over the bed in the designated way.</p><p>It takes a chain of chains to affect those whose lives were originally intended to be improved. As you go down from one chain to the next, the work a person focuses on also gets more concrete (lower construal level).</p><p>However, the chain of chains can easily be broken if any person doesn't pay sufficient attention to making decisions at other construal levels (although some are more replaceable than others). For example, if instead of starting a charity, the philosopher decided to be content with voicing his grievances at a lecture, probably little would have come out of it. Or if the executive director or website developer decided that working at any foreign aid charity was fine. Or if the donor decided not to read into the underlying vision of the website and instead donated to a local charity. And so on.</p><p>Making the entire operation happen requires tight coordination between numerous people who are able to both skilfully conduct their work, and see the importance of more abstract or concrete work done by others they are interacting with. If instead, each relied on the use of financial and social incentives to motivate others, it would be a most daunting endeavour.</p><h1>Cross the chasm</h1><p>Imagine someone visiting an EA meetup for the first time. If the person stepping through the doorway was an academic (or LessWrong addict), they might be thrilled to see a bunch of nerdy people engaging in intellectual discussions. But an activist (or social entrepreneur) stepping in would feel more at home seeing <a href=\"/ea/13y/reorganizing_ea_ntnu_into_agile_selforganizing/\">agile project teams</a> energetically typing away at their laptops. Right now, most local EA groups emphasise the former format, I suspect in part due to CEA's deep engagement stance, and in part because it's hard to find volunteer projects that <a href=\"/ea/1ow/why_groups_should_consider_direct_work/\">have sufficient direct impact</a>.</p><p>If the academic and activist happened to strike up a conversation, both sides could have trouble seeing the value produced by the other, because each is stuck at an entirely different level of abstraction. An organiser could help solve this disconnect by gradually encouraging the activist to go meta (<a href=\"https://excellenceassured.com/nlp-training/nlp-certification/hierarchy-of-ideas#iLightbox%5Bgallery560%5D/0\">chunking up</a>) and the academic to apply their brilliant insights <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/58g/levels_of_action/\">to real-life problems</a> (<a href=\"https://excellenceassured.com/nlp-training/nlp-certification/hierarchy-of-ideas#iLightbox%5Bgallery560%5D/0\">chunking down</a>). &nbsp;</p><p>As a community builder, I've found that this chasm seems especially wide for newcomers. Although the chasm gets filled up over time, people who've been involved in the EA community for years still encounter it, with some emphasising work on epistemics and values, and others emphasising work to gather data and get things done. The middle area seems neglected (i.e. deciding on the <a href=\"https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/problems-interventions-and-focus-areas/\">problem, intervention</a>, <a href=\"/ea/18p/concrete_project_lists/\">project</a>, and <a href=\"https://wavelength.asana.com/workstyle-establish-your-teams-workflow/\">workflow</a>).</p><p>Put simply, EAs tend to emphasise one of two categories:</p><ul><li><strong>Prioritisation&nbsp;</strong>(high level/far mode): <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Need_for_cognition\">figuring out</a> in what areas to do work</li><li><strong>Execution</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(low level/near mode):&nbsp;getting results on the ground<br><br>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Note: I don't base this on any psychological studies, which seems like the weakest link of this post. I'm curious to get an impartial view from someone well-versed in the literature.</p><p>Those who instead appreciate the importance of making decisions across all levels tend to do more good. For example, in my opinion:</p><ul><li>Peter Singer is exceptionally impactful not just because he is an excellent utilitarian philosopher, but because he argues for changes in foreign aid, factory farm practices, and so on.</li><li>Tanya Singh is exceptionally impactful not just because she was excellent <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/operations-management/#which-traits-do-you-need\">at operations</a> at an online shopping site, but because she later applied to work at the Future of Humanity Institute.</li></ul><h1>Commit &amp; correct</h1><p>The common thread so far is that you need to link up work done at various construal levels in order to do more good.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>To make this more specific:<br>Individuals who increase their impact the fastest tend to be</p><ul><li><i>corrigible</i> \u2013 quickly integrate new information into their beliefs from observations through to epistemics</li><li><i>committed</i> \u2013 propagate the decisions they make from high-level values down to the actions they take on the ground (put another way: actually pursue the goals they set for themselves)<br><br>&nbsp;</li></ul><p>To put this into pseudomaths:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995038/mirroredImages/Ekzvat8FbHRiPLn9Z/dmufsbda918qk5quezdp.png\"></figure><p>Where level refers to the level numbers as in the diagram.</p><p>Note: This multiplication between levels assumes that if you change decisions on higher levels (e.g. by changing what charity organisation you work at), you are able to transfer the skills and know-how you've acquired on lower levels (this works well with e.g. operations skills but not as well with e.g. street protest skills). Also, though the multiplication of traits in this formula implies that the impact of some EAs is orders of a magnitude higher than others, it's hard to evaluate these traits as an outsider.</p><p>Specialise &amp; transact</p><p>Does becoming good at all construal levels mean we should all become generalists? No, I actually think that as a growing community we\u2019re doing a poor job at dividing up labour compared to what I see as the gold standard \u2013 <a href=\"http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/DivisionofLabor.html\">decentralised market exchange</a>. This is where we can use V2ADC to zoom out over the entire community:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995038/mirroredImages/Ekzvat8FbHRiPLn9Z/xztf6hnotrkb6vopllvq.png\"></figure><p>The circles illustrate network clusters of people that exchange a lot with each other. Interestingly, a cluster of agents working toward (shared) goals can be seen as a super-agent with resulting super-goals, as can one person with sub-goals be seen as being the amalgamation of <a href=\"http://meltingasphalt.com/neurons-gone-wild/\">sub-agents interacting with each other</a>.</p><p>A more realistic but messy depiction of our community's interactions would look <a href=\"https://content.linkedin.com/content/dam/blog/en-us/corporate/blog/2011/01/alisnetwork-1.jpg\">like this</a> (+ line weights to denote how much people exchange). Also, people tend to actually cluster at each construal level \u2013 e.g. there are project team clusters, corporate animal welfare outreach clusters, factory farming reduction clusters, animal welfare clusters, and so on. Many of these clusters contain people who are not (yet) committed to EA, which makes sense, both in our ability to do good together and for introducing new people to the principles of EA. &nbsp;</p><p>See <a href=\"http://networksciencebook.com/\">here</a> for a great academic intro to social networks.<br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>As more individuals become connected within the EA network, each should specialise at construal levels in a role they excel at. They can then transact with others to acquire other needed information and delegate remaining work (e.g. an operations staff member can both learn from a philosopher and take over organisational tasks that are too much for them). Exceptions: leaders and professional networkers often need to have a broad focus across all of these levels as they function as hubs \u2013 judiciously relaying information and work requests from one network cluster to another.</p><p>With a transaction, I mean a method of giving resources to someone (financial, human, social, and temporal capital) in return for progress on your goals (i.e. to get something back that satisfies your <a href=\"https://study.com/academy/lesson/consumer-preferences-choice-in-economics.html\">preferences</a>).</p><p>Here are three transactions common to EAs:</p><ol><li>Collaborations involve giving resources to someone whom you trust, has <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/community/#how-can-the-effective-altruism-community-boost-your-career\">the same goals</a> and is capable of using your resources to make progress on those goals. When this is the case, EAs will tend to transact more and cluster in groups to capture the added value (the higher alignment in collaborations reduces <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/11/why-you-should-focus-more-on-talent-gaps-not-funding-gaps/#fn-1\">principal agent problems</a>).<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Reciprocal favours involves giving up a tiny amount of your resources to help someone make disproportional progress on goals that are unaligned with yours (e.g. connect someone working on another problem with a colleague), with an implicit expectation of that person returning the favour at some point in the future (put another way, it increases your social capital). It's a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gift_economy\">practical alternative</a> to <a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/moral-trade-1.pdf\">moral trade</a> (instead of e.g. signing contracts, which is both time consuming and socially awkward). The downside of reciprocal favours is that you often won't be able to offer a specific resource that the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coincidence_of_wants\">other party wants</a>. This is where a <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mediumofexchange.asp\">medium of exchange</a> comes in useful instead:</li><li>Payments involve giving someone <a href=\"http://www.ynharari.com/topic/money-and-politics/\">money</a> based on the recipient's stated intent of what they will do with that money.<br><br>&nbsp;</li></ol><p>EAs are never perfectly (mis)aligned \u2013 they will be more aligned at some levels and less aligned at others. For example:<br>&nbsp;</p><ol><li>You can often collaborate with other EAs on shared goals if you pick the levels right. For one, most EAs strongly value internal consistency and rigour, so it's easy to start a conversation as a high-level collaboration to get closer to 'the truth'. To illustrate, though Dickens and Tomasik clearly disagreed <a href=\"/ea/ne/on_values_spreading/5n3\">here</a> on moral realism vs. anti-realism, they still collaborated on understanding the problem of AI alignment better.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Where goals diverge, however, reciprocal favours can create shared value. This can happen when e.g. a foreign aid policy maker types out a quick email for an animal charity director to connect her with a colleague (though if the policy maker made the decision because he's uncertain whether global poverty is the best focus area, it's a collaboration). But in a fundamental way, we're all unaligned: EAs, like other humans, have an intrinsic drive to show off their altruistic deeds through <a href=\"http://elephantinthebrain.com/\">signalling</a>. The recipients of these signals have the choice whether or not to encourage them to make these decisions again by giving back compliments, gifts and other tokens of social status. This in turn influences the community's norms at large.</li><li>Although employers who pay money to cover the salaries tend to roughly agree with employees on e.g. what problems and interventions to work on, the employees also have sub-goals (such as feeling safe, comfortable and admired by others) that are <a href=\"/ea/1bm/what_is_valuable_about_effective_altruism/\">personal to them</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</li></ol><p>By 'transacting' with others you're able to compensate for your personal limitations to achieving your goals: the fact that you'll never be able to <a href=\"https://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw.html?chapter_num=1#book-reader\">acquire all required knowledge yourself</a> nor be able to do all work as skillfully as the few things you can become particularly capable at.&nbsp;<br><br>Integrate the low-level into the high-level</p><p>Most of this post has been about pushing values down into actions, which implies that people doing low-construal level work should merely follow instructions from above. Although it's indeed useful for those people to use prioritisation advice to decide where to do work, they also fulfill the essential function of <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/12/test-near-apply.html\">feeding back information</a> that can be used to update overarching models.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>We face a major risk of ideological rust in our community. This is where people who are working out high-level decisions either don't receive enough information from below or <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4KSWmJm6K3EEvHBkd/getting-nearer\">no longer respond to it</a>. As a result, their models separate from reality and their prioritisation advice becomes misguided. To illustrate this\u2026<br>&nbsp;</p><p>At a <i>Strategies level</i>, you find that much of AI alignment research is built on paradigms like 'the intelligence explosion' and 'utility functions' that arose from pioneering work done by the Future of Humanity Institute and Machine Intelligence Research Institute. Fortunately, leaders within the community are aware of the <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Information_cascade\">information cascades</a> this can lead to, but the question remains whether they're integrating insights on machine learning progress fast enough into their organisations' strategies.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>At a <i>Causes level</i>, a <a href=\"/ea/1fi/ea_survey_2017_series_have_ea_priorities_changed/\">significant proportion</a> of the EA community champions work on AI safety. But then there's the question: how many others are doing specialised research on the risks of pandemics, nanotechnology, and <a href=\"https://api.globalchallenges.org/static/files/Global%20Catastrophic%20Risks%202017.pdf\">so on</a>? And how much of this gets integrated into new cause rankings?&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>At a <i>Values level</i>, it is crazy how one person's worldview leads them to work on safeguarding the <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/why-the-long-run-future-matters-more-than-anything-else-and-what-we-should-do-about-it/\">existence of future generations</a>, another on <a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/altruists-focus-reducing-short-term-far-future-suffering/\">preventing their suffering</a> and another to <a href=\"http://www.plantinghappiness.co.uk/armageddon/\">work on neither</a>. This reflects actual moral uncertainty \u2013 to build up a worldview, you basically need to integrate most of your life experiences into a workable model. Having philosophers and researchers explore diverse <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/update-cause-prioritization-open-philanthropy#Key_worldview_choices_and_why_they_might_call_for_diversification\">worldviews</a> and exchange arguments is essential in ensuring that we don't rust in our current conjecture.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Now extend it to organisational structure:&nbsp;<br>We should also use the principle of decentralised experimentation, exchange and integration of information more in how we structure EA organisations. There has been a tendency to concentrate resources (financial, human and social capital) within a few organisations like the Open Philanthropy Project and the Centre for Effective Altruism who then set the agenda for the rest of the community (i.e. push decisions down their chains).<br>&nbsp;</p><p>This seems somewhat misguided. Larger organisations do have less redundancy and can divide up tasks better internally. But a team of <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team\">24 staff members</a> is still at a clear cognitive disadvantage at gathering and processing low-level data compared to a decentralised exchange between 1000 committed EAs. By themselves, they can't zoom in closely on enough details to update their high-level decision models appropriately. In other words, concentrated decision-making leads to fragile decision-making \u2013 just as it has done for <a href=\"https://www.benkuhn.net/ea-critique#historical-analogues\">central planning</a>.</p><p>Granted, it is <a href=\"https://youtu.be/bDhl22Qv-Qg?t=8m38s\">hard</a> to find people you can trust to delegate work to. OpenPhil and CEA are making headway in allocating funding to specialised experts (e.g. OpenPhil's allocation to CEA, which in turn allocated to EA Grants) and collaborating with organisations who gather and analyse more detailed data (e.g. CEA's individual outreach team working with the Local Effective Altruism Network). My worry is that they're not delegating enough.</p><p>Given the uncertainty they are facing, most of OpenPhil's charity recommendations and CEA's community-building policies should be overturned or radically altered in the next few decades. That is, if they actually discover their mistakes.&nbsp;<br>This means it's crucial for them to encourage more people to do local, contained experiments and then integrate their results into more accurate models.</p><p>EDIT: see these comments on where they could create better systems to facilitate this:</p><ul><li><a href=\"/ea/1qn/open_thread_40/esz\">on EA Forum</a></li><li><a href=\"/ea/1qo/ideas_for_scaling_grants_to_individual_eas_ea/etk\">on EA Grants</a></li><li><a href=\"/ea/19d/update_on_effective_altruism_funds/arg?context=1#arg\">on EA Funds</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/?multi_permalinks=1829824723740543&amp;comment_id=1830701230319559\">on Earning-to-Give</a></li></ul><p>Private donors who have the time and aptitude to research specialised problem niches and feed up their findings to bigger funders should do so (likewise, CEA should actively discourage these specific donors <a href=\"http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/effective-altruism-is-self-recommending/#Stage_3_Effective_altruism_is_self-recommending\">from donating to EA Funds</a>). Local community builders should test out different event formats and feed up outcomes to LEAN. And so on.</p><p>However, if bigger organisations would hardly use this information, most of the <a href=\"/ea/170/ea_should_invest_more_in_exploration/\">exploration value</a> would get lost. Understandably, this outpour of data is too overwhelming for any human (tribe) to manually process.</p><p>We therefore need to build vertically integrated data analysis platforms that separate the signal from the noise, update higher-level models, and then share those models with relevant people. On these platforms, people can then upload data, use rigorous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining\">data mining</a> techniques and share the results through targeted channels like the <a href=\"/ea/1q6/announcing_prioritywiki_a_cause_prioritization/\">PriorityWiki</a>.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I introduced this decision chain in a <a href=\"/ea/1lc/the_valuestoactions_chain_a_rough_model/\">previous post</a>, which I revised after chatting with thoughtful people at two CEA retreats. Thanks to Kit Harris for his incisive feedback on the categorisation, Siebe Rozendal and Fokel Ellen for their insightful text corrections, and Max Dalton, Victor Sint Nicolaas and all the other people who beared with me last year when I was <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1m399HrcEbteNCDEc160s3vWaeUwS1BdEoFrRrogp2tc/edit\">still forming these ideas</a>.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>If you found this analysis valuable, considering making <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/remmelt\">a donation</a> or email me at remmelt@effectiefaltruisme.nl (also if you want to avoid transaction costs through a bank transfer).

Obviously, info-benefits must outweigh the info-hazards of the open public discussion of x-risks, or the research of the x-risks is useless. In other words, the &#x201C;cost-effectiveness&#x201D; of the open discussion of a risk A should be estimated, and the potential increase in catastrophic probability should be weighed against a possible decrease of the probability of a catastrophe.</p>\n<p>The benefits of public discussion are rather obvious: If we publicly discuss a catastrophic risk, we can raise awareness about it, prepare for the risk, and increase funding for its prevention. Publicly discussed risks are also more likely to be viewed by a larger group of scientists than those that are discussed by some closed group. Interdisciplinary research and comparison of different risks is impossible if they are secrets of different groups; as a result of this phenomenon, for example, asteroid risks are overestimated (more publicly discussed) and biorisks are underestimated (less-discussed).&#xA0;</p>\n<p>A blanket &quot;information hazard counterargument&quot; is too general, as any significant new research on x-risks changes the information landscape. For example, even good news about new prevention methods may be used by bad actors to overcome these methods.</p>\n<p>The problem of informational hazards has already been explored in the field of computer security, and they have developed best practices in this area. The protocol calls for the discoverer of an informational hazard to first try to contact the firm which owns the vulnerable software, and later, if there is no reply, to publish it openly (or at least hint at it), to provide users with an advantage over bad actors who may use it secretly.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>The relative power of info-hazards depends on the information that has already been published and on other circumstances</strong>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Consideration 1. If something is already public knowledge, then discussing it is not an informational hazard. Example: AI risk. The same is true for the &#x201C;attention hazard&#x201D;: if something is extensively present now in the public filed, it is less dangerous to discuss it publicly.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Consideration 2: If information X is public knowledge, then similar information X2 is a lower informational hazard. Example: if the genome of a flu virus N1 has been published, publishing similar flu genome N2 has a marginal informational hazard.</p>\n<p>Consideration 3. If many info-hazards have already been openly published, the world may be considered saturated with info-hazards, as a malevolent agent already has access to so much dangerous information. In our world, where genomes of the pandemic flus have been openly published, it is difficult to make the situation worse.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Consideration 4: If I have an idea about x-risks in a field in which I don&#x2019;t have technical expertise and it only took me one day to develop this idea, such an idea is probably obvious to those with technical expertise, and most likely regarded by them as trivial or non-threatening.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Consideration 5: A layman with access only to information available on Wikipedia is not able to generate ideas about really powerful informational hazards, that could not already be created by a dedicated malevolent agent, like the secret service of a rogue country. However, if one has access to unique information, which is typically not available to laymen, this could be an informational hazard.</p>\n<p>Consideration 6. Some ideas will be suggested anyway soon, but by speakers who are less interested in risk prevention. For example, ideas similar to Roko&#x2019;s Basilisk have been suggested independently twice by my friends.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Consideration 7: Suppressing some kinds of information may signal its importance to malevolent agents, producing a &#x201C;Streisand effect&#x201D;.</p>\n<p>Consideration 8: If there is a secret net to discuss such risks, some people will be excluded from it, which may create undesired social dynamics.</p>\n<p><strong>Info-hazard classification&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p>There are several types of catastrophic informational hazard (a more detailed classification can be seen in Bostrom&#x2019;s article, which covers not only catastrophic info-hazards, but all possible ones):&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>* Technical dangerous information (genome of a virus),&#xA0;</p>\n<p>* Ideas about possible future risks (like deflection of asteroids to Earth)&#xA0;</p>\n<p>* Value-related informational hazards (e.g. idea voluntary human extinction movement or fighting overpopulation by creation small catastrophes).&#xA0;</p>\n<p>* Attention-related info-hazards &#x2013; they are closely related to value-hazard, as the more attention gets the idea, the more value humans typically gives to it. the potentially dangerous idea should be discussed in the ways where it more likely attracts the attention of the specialists than public or potentially dangerous agents. This includes special forums, jargon, non-sensational titles, and scientific fora for discussion.</p>\n<p>The most dangerous are value-related and technical information. Value-related information could work as a self-replicating meme, and technical information could be used to actually create dangerous weapons, while ideas about possible risks could help us to prepare for such risks or start additional research.</p>\n<p><strong>Value of public discussion</strong></p>\n<p>We could use human extinction probability change as the only important measure of the effectiveness of any action according to Bostrom&#x2019;s maxipoc. In that case, the utility of any public statement A is:</p>\n<p>V = &#x2206;I(increase of survival probability via better preparedness) &#x2013; &#x2206;IH(increase of the probability of the x-risk because the bad actors will know it).&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Emerging technologies increase the complexity of the future, which in some moment could become chaotic. The more chaotic is the future, the shorter is planning horizon, and the less time we have to act preventively. We need a full picture of the future risks for strategic planning. To have the full picture, we have to openly discuss the risks without going in the technical details.</p>\n<p>The reason for it is that we can&#x2019;t prevent risks which we don&#x2019;t know, and the prevention strategy should have full list of risks, while malevolent agent may need only technical knowledge of one risk (and such knowledge is already available in the field of biotech, so malevolent agents can&#x2019;t gain much from our lists).</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Society could benefit from the open discussion of possible risks ideas as such discussion could help in the development of general prevention measures, increasing awareness, funding and cooperation. This could also help us to choose priorities in fighting different global risks.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>For example, biorisks are less-discussed and thus could be perceived as being less of a threat than the risks of AI. However, biorisks could exterminate humanity before the emergence of superintelligent AI (to prove this argument I would have to present general information which may be regarded as having informational hazard). But the amount of technical hazardous information openly published is much larger in the field of biorisks &#x2013; exactly because the risk of the field as a whole is underestimated!</p>\n<p>If you have a new idea which may appear to be a potential info-hazard, you may need to search the internet to find out if it has already been published &#x2013; most likely, it is. Then you may privately discuss it with a respected scientist in the field, who also has knowledge of catastrophic risks and ask if the scientist thinks that this idea is really dangerous. The attention hazard should be overcome by non-sensationalist and non-media-attracting methods of analysis.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>It is a best practice to add to the description of any info-hazard the ways in which the risk could be overcome, or why the discussion could be used to find approaches for its mitigation.</p>\n<p><strong>Literature</strong>:&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Bostrom &#x201C;Information Hazards: A Typology of Potential Harms from Knowledge&#x201D;, 2011.&#xA0; https://nickbostrom.com/information-hazards.pdf</p>\n<p>Yampolsky &#x201C;BEYOND MAD?: THE RACE FOR ARTIFICIAL GENERAL INTELLIGENCE&#x201D;</p>\n<p>https://www.itu.int/en/journal/001/Documents/itu2018-9.pdf</p>\n<p>https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Information_hazard&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "turchin"}}, {"_id": "gFxgPhn3myvjo7NSo", "title": "Announcing PriorityWiki: A Cause Prioritization Wiki", "postedAt": "2018-06-18T22:33:58.656Z", "htmlBody": "<p><em>This essay was jointly written by Peter Hurford and Marcus A.

Briefly, in a donor lottery, donors pool money for charitable contribution. They&apos;re given lottery tickets in proportion to their contributions. The winner of the lottery gets to decide where the pool of charitable funds should be donated. For example, two people each set aside $1,000 for charitable contribution. They then make an agreement and the winner of the coin flip gets to donate the whole $2,000 to the charity of their choosing.</p>\n<p>The primary claimed advantage to these lotteries is economies of scale. It probably doesn&apos;t make sense to spend 100 hours picking the absolutely perfect charity when you&apos;re only disbursing $1000 as a solo donor. It probably does make sense to spend the time to make the decision carefully when disbursing $100,000 as the winner of a donor lottery. Other economies of scale include things like: improved chance of response when asking charities for more information, can fund projects with threshold cost (i.e. we can&apos;t even start the project unless we receive at least $XX,000 dollars).</p>\n<h1>A common concern</h1>\n<p>Though the original proposals all highlight that the primary benefit of donor lotteries is economies of scale, I&apos;ve heard many in the EA community concerned about alignment of other donors: &quot;What if I don&apos;t trust others in the lottery to do thorough research?&quot;, &quot;What if others in the lottery prioritize different cause areas?&quot;.</p>\n<p>Though early advocates address these concerns briefly, subsequent discussions suggests it might be useful to address these concerns more vividly.</p>\n<h1>Donor lottery with the devil</h1>\n<p>I contend you should be willing to enter a donor lottery with the devil (this is the weirdly honorable&#xA0;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deal_with_the_Devil\">Faustian</a> devil that respects all his compacts). To see this, we just proceed systematically.</p>\n<p>Suppose you and the devil each contribute $10,000 dollars. This is your life savings while the devil merely tosses in a carbuncular carbuncle from his pit of gems and anguish. You flip a fair coin.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Suppose you enter the lottery and win: You&apos;ve doubled your money. Because we suppose economies of scale at relatively small amounts like this, the good you can do is more than doubled versus abstaining from the lottery and donating the initial $10,000. On the other side of the bet, the devil is forced to bankroll evil with a mere $X trillion - $10,000. Given the devil&apos;s vast wealth, his plans are unconstrained by funding and the loss of $10,000 represents the evaporation of a single drop in an endless sea of agony. He goes on to do almost exactly as much evil as he would have done without the lottery.</p>\n<p>Suppose you enter the lottery and lose: You&apos;ve lost all your money and do no good whatsoever. The devil laughs in triumph, but his heart isn&apos;t really in it. Because, again, the money means nothing to him. He&apos;s working on higher levels in&#xA0;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maslow%27s_hierarchy_of_needs\">Maslow&apos;s hierarchy of needs</a>.</p>\n<p>Finally, suppose you abstain from the lottery: You spend your $10,000 dollars to do good, the devil spends his $X trillion to do evil, and the world hangs in the balance.</p>\n<p>Now we can calculate the expected value. The devil does just as much evil in each of the three outcomes. If you abstain from dealing with the devil, you do X good. If you enter the lottery, there&apos;s a 50% chance you do &gt; 2X good and a 50% chance you do 0 good. The expected value of entering the lottery is then &gt; X.</p>\n<h1>Real donor lotteries</h1>\n<p>Obviously, this isn&apos;t actually the decision that confronts you. But it highlights that the crucial consideration for donor lotteries is economies of scale. You should only worry about your fellow lottery participants insofar as you think they are significantly misaligned with you <em>and&#xA0;</em>have significantly <em>greater</em>&#xA0;economies of scale than you do. If either of these factors is small, you have little to worry about in this regard.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "cole_haus"}}, {"_id": "Jp5Gs9nsRA6pzBeQN", "title": "Effective Advertising and Animal Charity Evaluators", "postedAt": "2018-06-13T19:43:07.214Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>[<em>Summary: Animal Charity Evaluators wants to address feedback that we&apos;ve heard from the effective altruism community regarding our online marketing practices. Although we follow best practices in the advertising industry, some EAs feel that we sometimes use advertising which glosses over details and is potentially misleading to the public. As the communications data scientist for ACE, I explain why we feel these advertising practices are not only net beneficial to the EA community, but also should not be considered to be misleading.</em>]</p>\n<p>Our mission at ACE is <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/about/background/who-we-are/\">to find and promote the most effective ways to help animals</a>. One of the ways in which the promotion part of our mission is fulfilled most effectively is through reaching those who are most passionate about helping animals but who have not yet been introduced to the concept of effective altruism.</p>\n<p>While some of our ads are aimed at existing EAs, the majority of our advertising efforts focus on the above audience for three reasons: (1) the large scale of this audience compared with the size of the EA audience, (2) our belief that they have the most potential for change once they learn about effective animal advocacy (EAA), and (3) the fact that their counterfactual donations seem likely to be less impactful than those of EAs.</p>\n<p>We have received some feedback on a few of these marketing practices&#x2014;specifically, we have received feedback suggesting that we might not be advertising in a way that the EA community would most like to see. I will go over a few such examples before sharing why we use our current methods of advertising.</p>\n<h2>Double Donations</h2>\n<p>In late 2017, we held a donation-matching campaign. A generous donor offered to match any donations we received to the <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/rcf-donation/\">ACE Recommended Charity Fund</a>. This Fund is not used for ACE operations; the entirety of this Fund goes toward our recommended charities. (We now have a checkbox indicating that users may choose to donate 10% of their gift directly to ACE, but at the time <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/aces-room-for-more-funding-in-2018/\">we had already reached our funding cap for the year</a> and were not accepting new donations.)</p>\n<p>We know that the EA community is generally <a href=\"/ea/13w/matchingdonation_fundraisers_can_be_harmfully/\">not in favor of donation-matching campaigns</a>. There are four main reasons why this is so:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Most donation-matching campaigns are illusory</li>\n<li>Non-illusory campaigns may do harm via double-counting</li>\n<li>Matching campaigns encourage dishonesty</li>\n<li>There may be better ways for large donors to leverage their money</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Most donation-matching campaigns are illusory</h3>\n<p>At ACE, we are careful to ensure that any matching campaigns are entirely non-illusory. <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/15/why-you-shouldnt-let-donation-matching-affect-your-giving/\">GiveWell has pointed out several problems with illusory matching campaigns</a>. We agree with their reasoning. For example, last year a donor approached us asking about doing a matching campaign to benefit ACE; we declined it because their donation was going to happen whether we set up a campaign or not.</p>\n<p>However, not all matching campaigns are illusory. For our year-end donation-matching campaign in 2017, we had a donor who would not otherwise have given to our Recommended Charity Fund but who was interested in doing a donation-matching campaign with us. We discussed how a non-illusory campaign might very likely reach a broader audience, inspiring hundreds of new people to participate in effective giving for the first time. We believe this type of influence matching is especially effective with non-EAs. However, as Karnofsky <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/15/why-you-shouldnt-let-donation-matching-affect-your-giving/\">points out</a>, it may be better for existing EAs to ignore the <a href=\"http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/matching-donation-fundraisers-can-be-harmfully-dishonest/\">influence matching aspect</a> when making decisions on where to donate&#x2014;even if we prefer non-EAs to be influenced by them.</p>\n<p>ACE&#x2019;s commitment to non-illusory matching campaigns alleviates the concern raised by Jeff Kaufman about <a href=\"/ea/ft/the_counterfactual_validity_of_donation_matching/\">counterfactual trust</a> and contradicts the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/eahangout/permalink/1630235113730073/\">assumptions made by most polled EAs on Facebook</a>. Sometimes even illusory donation-matching campaigns can be beneficial (as Avi Norowitz points out with the <a href=\"/ea/1jo/ea_givingtuesday_fundraiser_matching_retrospective/\">Facebook #GivingTuesday retrospective</a>) but this requires special circumstances.</p>\n<p>We are careful to explicitly note our position on these influence-matching campaigns in <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/about/background/faq/\">our FAQ</a>, and we believe that using them has been a net positive for our non-EA audience.</p>\n<h3>Non-illusory campaigns may cause harm via double-counting.</h3>\n<p>Ben Hoffman has rightfully pointed out that <a href=\"/ea/13w/matchingdonation_fundraisers_can_be_harmfully/\">overassignment of credit can obscure opportunity costs</a> with donation-matching campaigns. Given two rational EA actors, believing that each is causing the other to donate may result in a scenario where each is giving less optimally than they&#x2019;d otherwise choose. However, this example only causes harm if both sides are changing their mind on where to donate due to the existence of the donation match.</p>\n<p>At ACE, we only accept matching campaigns where this does not occur. While we don&#x2019;t have full certainty of their counterfactual actions, we believe our matching donor not only would likely have counterfactually given a smaller amount elsewhere had we not done the campaign (thus making our campaign non-illusory), but also that they would have counterfactually funded a different non-EAA donation-matching campaign. This ensures that, at most, only one side is influenced by the matching campaign&#x2014;and so evades the situation Hoffman describes where double-counting causes harm.<a href=\"#fn1\">&#xB9;</a></p>\n<h3>Matching campaigns encourage dishonesty</h3>\n<p>Overassigning credit isn&#x2019;t the only way that matching campaign incentives reward dishonesty. In 2016 Benjamin Todd reported that <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/participating-in-donation-matching#fb-819471645132_820815092852\">80,000 Hours had previously run partially counterfactually valid donation matching campaigns</a>, by allowing the donor to commit to delaying funding rather than ensuring that the funding is completely counterfactually valid. Ben Kuhn ran a survey that found that <a href=\"https://www.benkuhn.net/matching-results\">most donors expect matching campaigns to be entirely counterfactually valid</a>, so this remains an issue.</p>\n<p>At ACE, we&#x2019;ve tried to maintain a balance of being intellectually honest and using copywriting that isn&#x2019;t overly wordy. During our year-end donation-matching campaign, we initially used advertisements that contained the phrase &#x201C;Double Your Impact&#x201D;, but then switched to &#x201C;Double Your Donation&#x201D; after receiving feedback about where that balance made the most sense.<a href=\"#fn2\">&#xB2;</a></p>\n<p>We believe using &#x201C;Double Your Donation&#x201D; as an advertisement headline strikes that balance well. It is an appropriate shorthand for what is actually occuring: the amount of money that would go to this fund was indeed doubled, and, had the donation match not occurred, our matching donor may have given to a different non-EA cause.</p>\n<p>As further evidence that these are real counterfactual matches where influenced donations are legitimately doubled, in 2016 and 2017 we surpassed the agreement of what the donor had originally offered to match, after which the donor followed up by continuing the match through these additional donations to more than double what they originally offered toward the matching challenge.</p>\n<h3>There may be better ways for large donors to leverage their money</h3>\n<p>Ben Kuhn performed <a href=\"https://www.benkuhn.net/matching\">a survey of research on the effectiveness of matching campaigns</a>, concluding that matching campaign effects are generally smaller than we might at first expect, and suggesting that there are more effective ways for large donors to leverage their money. We have no reason to doubt the validity of his analysis, though we do have limited conflicting anecdotal data from our matching campaigns.</p>\n<p>When we are approached by large donors, we generally try to steer them away from the donation-matching campaigns they are ordinarily used to, advising them to fund general unrestricted programs and administration instead. However, last year we set a funding cap for our own operations; once met, there are only so many other ways that large donors can leverage their money. When a legitimate influence-matching campaign opportunity arises, we don&#x2019;t think it is inappropriate to take advantage of it at the 1:1 rate, even if the returns may not be as much as you might expect.</p>\n<p>Anecdotally, we&#x2019;ve found that our matching campaigns have brought in a disproportionately large number of new donors&#x2014;the majority of whom were not previously involved with effective giving. While we did not set up a control group, we can report that 73% of the donors to our 2017 matching campaign were first-time donors with ACE, and our post-donation survey showed that over 80% of respondents reported being motivated to give specifically due to the matching opportunity. In addition to the hundreds of thousands of dollars raised by this new audience,<a href=\"#fn3\">&#xB3;</a> we were able to teach them about effective animal advocacy and to support them in effective giving elsewhere in the EA movement. The amount that these donors will give to effective charities during their lifetime is significantly higher than the donation-matching campaign that attracted them; we continue to build relationships with these new donors. So while we concur with Kuhn that the raw donation amounts might not be as influenced by a donation match as we may at first think, in our case the flow-through effects seem to more than make up for this difference.</p>\n<h3>Utilons Versus Fuzzies</h3>\n<p>Another advertising example that has received some <a href=\"https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2016/06/03/on-welcomingness-in-ea/\">limited criticism</a> from the EA community is our tendency to use cute pictures of animals and catchy messaging in many of our ads. We&#x2019;ve heard this critique several times in person at EA conferences, although it&#x2019;s rare to see the argument explicitly laid out online. The idea is that advertising in a way that tugs at people&#x2019;s fuzzies may be appropriate for direct-level EAA organizations such as The Humane League, but that a meta-charity like ACE should focus solely on arguments for maximizing utility. By posting cute pictures or clever one-liners, we may be misrepresenting the type of work we do. After all, GiveWell&#x2019;s Facebook feed rarely uses pictures other than to show graphs or their logo; and MIRI&#x2019;s feed focuses on showcasing data, not cute pictures.</p>\n<p>We feel that these lines of argumentation misunderstand the role that ACE plays in the EA movement. Yes, we have a core audience of EAs who use our charity recommendations&#x2014;and yes, those recommendations are based on what we find to be most effective. We fully identify as an effective altruist organization. However, a large portion of our intended audience is comprised of animal lovers who are not yet aware of EA principles. We strongly believe that this is the audience that is capable of making the largest positive change once they learn about effective animal advocacy. Catching their attention via cute animal pictures is the best way we&#x2019;ve found so far to get them to read more about why effectiveness is important.</p>\n<p>We have data to support this. We&#x2019;ve experimented with pushing out various types of Facebook posts to both our current audience (to increase engagement) and to potential new followers. Although we make a point to post a combination of EA-oriented messaging alongside posts that showcase cute animals, the only posts that receive traction significant enough to generate engagement and reach a larger audience are the ones that use fuzzies, not utilons, as the main hook.</p>\n<p>Facebook in particular has a <a href=\"https://blog.bufferapp.com/facebook-news-feed-algorithm\">positive feedback loop</a> where the posts which garner the most reactions and engagement tend to be shown to more followers, whereas the lower-performing posts only get shown to a subset of our Facebook audience. This results in the average Facebook user getting the impression that the majority of our posts are fuzzies-centric on trending topics, when in reality a considerable amount of our posts are utility-centric on data-oriented news.<a href=\"#fn4\">&#x2074;</a></p>\n<p>This feedback loop works to our advantage. Over time, the best performing posts reach non-EA audiences who are likely to be sympathetic to the cause of effective animal advocacy. This allows our brand to grow consistently, introducing new people to the ideas of the EA movement.</p>\n<h2>Graph Accuracy and Completeness</h2>\n<p><img src=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/2018-donation-impact-violin-plot-tiny@2x.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>We&#x2019;re currently in the process of improving some of our graphs in order to make them more easily shareable. For example, our <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/donation-advice/donation-impact/\">donation impact page</a> includes a violin plot that shows how many animals we estimate are spared by a $1,000 donation. While the data is accurate, the resulting graph is very difficult to interpret&#x2014;and is therefore not ideal for sharing at animal rights conferences or on social or journalistic media. The amount of time it takes to explain <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function\">probability density</a> to passersby at non-EA conferences or to general online audiences looking for a quick picture that explains ACE&#x2019;s thoughts usually exceeds their (understandably limited) attention span. If we want to reach these audiences, we need to produce graphs that illustrate the point much more efficiently.</p>\n<p>However, sharing just the average estimates (seven animals spared for shelters and 4,056 for ACE recommended charities) could be seen as deceitful, as it doesn&#x2019;t take into account the uncertainty involved in making these calculations.<a href=\"#fn5\">&#x2075;</a> Clearly, there is some compromise between a full violin plot and sharing just the mean as the best single estimate for each category. We are still working out where that balance lies.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/donation-allocation-chart-fullsize.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>A similar issue comes up with our <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/donation-advice/why-farmed-animals/\">donation allocation chart</a>.<a href=\"#fn6\">&#x2076;</a> The data on the left omits wild fishes, who receive almost no portion of animal charity donations. The data on the left also includes animals used for clothing, but the data on the right replaces that category with &#x201C;mixed or other activities.&#x201D; On the page, we explicitly point out how the &#x201C;mixed or other&#x201D; category was put together, giving an example of guide dog training as one component. This matters because some advocates may consider subcategories like guide dog training as a primarily human-centric charity, not an animal charity, and this might affect the relative size of the chart regions. However, when this chart does gets shared online, it&#x2019;s generally just the image portion that people will copy and paste. Although these shared images will not include the surrounding text, we believe it is sufficient to include the extra information on our website. We feel similarly with regard to the analogous donation impact chart; including the probability densities as additional information on our site is sufficient, so long as the chart itself includes <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/ace-highlight-our-use-of-cost-effectiveness-estimates/\">ranges for our cost-effectiveness estimates</a>.</p>\n<h2>Marketing Best Practices</h2>\n<p>The above marketing practices are specific to EA organizations. Most non-EA organizations do not object to setting up illusory donation-matching campaigns, nor reaching out based on fuzzies, nor ensuring that graphics are as accurate as possible. We care about these issues because we are committed to the norm of being <a href=\"/ea/1gu/the_extraordinary_value_of_ordinary_norms/\">extraordinarily honest</a>.<a href=\"#fn7\">&#x2077;</a> As Ben Hoffman <a href=\"/ea/13w/matchingdonation_fundraisers_can_be_harmfully/\">rightly points out</a>, &#x201C;When the activity of extracting money from donors is abstracted away from&#x2026;other core activities of an organization&#x2026;, best practices tend towards distorting the truth.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>This doesn&#x2019;t mean we should shy away from all nonprofit marketing best practices. To the extent that we can reach out to new audiences, increase the number of donors who are giving effectively, and grow our brand without compromising what we believe in, we feel that using best practices is both acceptable and desirable.</p>\n<p>One of our goals is to continually be better able to introduce non-EA animal advocates to effective animal advocacy ideas. We accomplish this through several methods:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We try to speak in language that non-EA animal advocates already understand when in an appropriate context. This not only means using cute pictures in social media posts, but also talking about projects and interventions that may not be a currently understood top intervention, so long as it reasonably could apply.</li>\n<li>We use <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_testing_in_marketing\">multivariate testing</a> on social media adverts and email campaigns, but we are careful to only test messaging that matches our brand and to only use subject lines that accurately convey the content of each email.</li>\n<li>We segment our audience, showing different information to different audiences, while being careful not to cut information sent to various audiences in a way that might be seen as deceitful. Specifically, we take care to only show different content based on the different interests of our audience; we do not alter the meaning behind our messages when segmenting our audience.</li>\n<li>We use a <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/increase-your-impact-with-googles-ad-grants/\">Google ad grant</a> and <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/thoughts-on-our-website-redesign/\">SEO efforts</a> to gain traffic from audiences not yet familiar with effective animal advocacy, without deceiving visitors as to what they will see once they visit.</li>\n<li>We track key performance indicators to judge how effective our communications strategies perform, but are careful not to focus on quantity at the expense of quality.</li>\n<li>We create <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/animalcharityeval/videos?sort=p&amp;flow=grid&amp;view=0\">videos</a> that appeal to a general audience through fuzzies in addition to posting videos of webinars and symposium talks.</li>\n<li>We take advantage of opportunities to direct more funding to effective animal charities, such as running a non-illusory matching campaign that is very likely to inspire new people to give effectively.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While we are careful not to blindly follow marketing best practices, we nevertheless utilize them when they don&#x2019;t interfere with our values. We prize integrity and take care to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ZP2om2oWHPhvWP2Q3/the-ethic-of-hand-washing-and-community-epistemic-practice\">exhibit norms of honesty</a> when following accepted marketing principles. We do not use &#x201C;rhetorical tricks&#x201D; nor &#x201C;sales techniques&#x201D; to convince others; our use of imagery is solely used to gain attention. Arguments for EAA on our site are fully <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/transparency/\">transparent</a>, and we both accept and <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/research-review-process-call-for-external-reviewers/\">encourage feedback</a> on the research we perform.</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;m proud to report that we are continuing to grow our brand, increase the number of donors who are giving effectively, and introduce new audiences to effective animal advocacy. In December last year, we raised over $1.26 million for our <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/donation-advice/recommended-charity-fund/\">Recommended Charity Fund</a><a href=\"#fn8\">&#x2078;</a>&#x2014;a significant portion of which came from extremely generous first-time donors not already identifying themselves as EAs. Of course, we couldn&#x2019;t achieve these results for our recommended charities without the support of EAs, who so generously helped to <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/aces-room-for-more-funding-in-2018/\">fully fund ACE</a> directly last year, but the larger point is that these strategies are encouraging non-EAAs to donate to more effective causes and are making a subset more aware of effective altruism in general.</p>\n<p>If you work with an EA organization, we would love to hear about the marketing/communications techniques and/or successes that you&#x2019;ve had when promoting EA organizations. We&#x2019;d also like to hear if anyone has any concerns about ACE or any other EA charity using these kinds of marketing techniques. Are you comfortable with ACE&#x2019;s methods of using donation-matching campaigns? Do you agree that marketing with fuzzies is acceptable even for a charity evaluator like ACE? What&#x2019;s the minimal amount of information our shareable images should convey?<a href=\"#fn9\">&#x2079;</a> Do you feel that the way ACE follows nonprofit marketing best practices is appropriate?</p>\n<p>We look forward to hearing your thoughts.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>&#xB9; <small>This donor decided to give to our Recommended Charity Fund on the basis of our recommendation, not by calculating the additional effects of the matching campaign, because they counterfactually would have done a different donation-matching campaign anyway. This means that while an overassignment of credit may have occurred, this overassignment did not change how the donor would have counterfactually acted.</small> <a title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\" href=\"#ref1\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n<p>&#xB2; <small>In November 2017 we initially used the phrase &#x201C;<em>This means that you can double the impact of your donation from now through the end of the year by donating to our Recommended Charity Fund</em>&#x201D; in at least one marketing material, but after receiving feedback from both ACE staff members and outside EAs (including Remmelt Ellen and Marianne van der Werf&#x2014;thank you to both!) we standardized to the &#x201C;double your donation&#x201D; language instead across all marketing materials.</small></p>\n<p><small>In previous years we were less strict about our language, using &#x201C;Double Your Impact&#x201D; in several advertisements during the 2015 and 2016 giving seasons. We did not make this choice blindly; at the time, we felt that &#x201C;double your impact&#x201D; and &#x201C;double your donation&#x201D; were different mostly in what kinds of audiences they attract, and that this overrode any concerns about one being more strictly accurate than the other. &#x201C;Double your impact&#x201D; emphasizes the effect of helping others, whereas &#x201C;double your donation&#x201D; emphasizes what one can personally accomplish.</small></p>\n<p><small>Note that these terms are regularly used interchangeably in fundraising campaigns outside the EA community, and we then felt that most people wouldn&#x2019;t take campaign headlines literally. In 2017, we updated to believing that it was not enough for our FAQ to describe our commitment to non-illusory matching campaigns, and we standardized to only use &#x201C;double your donation&#x201D; language going forward.</small> <a title=\"Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.\" href=\"#ref2\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n<p>&#xB3;&#xA0;<small>New donors made up 56% of the pre-matched amount raised during our 2017 matching campaign.</small> <a title=\"Jump back to footnote 3 in the text.\" href=\"#ref3\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n<p>&#x2074;&#xA0;<small>This positive feedback loop means that the majority of our Facebook post views are of fuzzy-style content.

However, it caused many of the answers to be less informative. It would\u2019ve probably been better to put questions like \u201cWhat\u2019s your plan for improving the world?\u201d first. It was also difficult to hear what many people said partly due to bad acoustics. Two people wrote that they were uncomfortable introducing themselves. Overall, some online document or a sheet on the wall would have probably been better.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Explaining concepts</span></p>\n<p><span>This is an idea we took from </span><a href=\"/ea/1mu/review_of_czea_intense_ea_weekend_retreat/\"><span>CZEA \"Intense EA Weekend\" retreat</span></a><span> because this was rated as the most useful event at that retreat. The participants were asked to pick from a list of interesting concepts (e.g. scope insensitivity, optimiser\u2019s curse) which ones they would like to have explained to them or explain to others. We used a different sheet from CZEA. Our sheet can be seen </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18wOt5SljGBXdYIrc1F6Z4JybFfMggoHAo05ToY9MxDo/edit?usp=sharing\"><span>here</span></a><span>. We asked people to divide into pairs or small groups and find different people when they hear a gong (every 15 minutes). We told that it is ok to skip topics if they don\u2019t want to explain them or have them explain. According to the feedback, this was not a successful event.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Productive disagreements workshop</span></p>\n<p><span>This idea was taken from </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/spencer.greenberg/posts/10103261151258532\"><span>an event that was ran in New York</span></a><span> and adapted for EA purposes. First, I gave a short talk on how to disagree productively. I then asked everyone to rate whether they \"agree\", \"disagree\" or are \"unsure\" on various controversial EA topics and give their opinions on the importance of various causes. A sheet of questions can be seen </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1rTJ4btZQq6sSj9jsjyfVB_cmlT98M2qfYUIENyDjdjg/edit?usp=sharing\"><span>here</span></a><span> (note that there are two tabs). We then asked participants to pair up, compare sheets, find disagreements and discuss. Every 15 minutes we asked everyone to find a different pair.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>One piece of feedback about the event was: \u201cHard to find disagreement. Many statements were too hard to have a confident belief on.\u201d I think another issue was that many people didn\u2019t know enough about some of the topics to have meaningful discussions.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>One idea was that explaining concepts and productive disagreements workshops could help people to have more productive discussions during 1 on 1s because it sets a tone of talking about EA topics. What is more, people could continue one of these activities during the 1 on 1s. Some people told me that events were successful in this regard. However, it still seems like overall they weren\u2019t very successful.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Discussing various topics in small groups</span></p>\n<p><span>The idea was:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li>People suggest many topics</li>\n<li>I read the list of topics and everyone votes on the ones they want to discuss (multiple votes allowed)</li>\n<li>People separate into groups based on which topic they want to discuss the most.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>This is the way discussions are organised at a philosophy meetup I occasionally attend. One mistake I made is not giving people a minute to think of topics to discuss. The only topics suggested were</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Diversity within EA community&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Value drift</li>\n<li>Productivity and self-improvement (this wasn\u2019t really a topic, it had prepared materials)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>We separated into three groups to discuss these. Discussions did not work too well, possibly because the groups were too big.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>\"How to talk about EA\" workshop</span></p>\n<p><span>We separated into 4 groups based on which subtopic we wanted to discuss. Subtopics were:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li>How to talk about EA with people interested in you</li>\n<li>How to talk about EA with people interested in the ideas</li>\n<li>How to talk about EA with people you want to be interested in the ideas</li>\n<li>How to talk about EA with people already on board</li>\n</ol>\n<p><span>In the feedback form, two people mentioned that they\u2019d rather this was a workshop (possibly a one that includes roleplay) rather than a discussion.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Application forms</span></h2>\n<p><span>We publicly advertised </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSev-l0qBwH0RPmL3ZA2e7Lq_dXeDAVcsnp_B1FJYyCOXw37SA/viewform\"><span>an expression of interest google form</span></a><span>. Purposes were:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>See how many people are interested</li>\n<li>Filter out the people who are not yet familiar with EA (because the event was not aimed at newcomers). This required quite a lot of effort. I don't think it was worth it.</li>\n<li>See which events people are most interested in attending</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Out of 57 people who filled the form, only 14 attended the event. This is partly because we publicized the form 2 months before the event but sent tickets only 2 weeks before the event because that\u2019s when the availability of the venue was confirmed. Some people made other plans for the weekend because they weren\u2019t sure if the event is going to happen. We had to send the tickets sooner with no venue specified. Many of the attendees came because we invited them personally 2 weeks before the weekend. Some of them also invited other people. There could have been many more attendees if we sent invitations sooner. However, it\u2019s unclear whether it would\u2019ve been easy to manage many more people.</span></p>", "user": {"username": "saulius"}}, {"_id": "F78jJidgsdh5sfrN8", "title": "Announcing the second AI Safety Camp", "postedAt": "2018-06-11T19:11:35.067Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><h3>What is the AI Safety Camp?</h3>\n<p>Would you like to work on AI safety or strategy research and are looking for a concrete way to get started?

I delineate the basis of this framework throughout the history of effective altruism and precursor movements as a focus on groups of beneficiary populations whose well-being is as important as anyone else&apos;s, but for a variety of reasons these problems have gone neglected or intractable, until the turn of the 21st century when emerging technologies promised the potential to turn the tide. On this basis EA and adjacent movements have become a globally coordinated network to apply emerging technologies to mitigate extant or potential global catastrophes fitting this framework.</span></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div><span>&#xA0;</span></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div><em><span>I. Introduction</span></em></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div><span>In May 2016, Ozy Brennan wrote on their blog </span><a title=\"https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2016/05/31/missing-cause-areas/\" href=\"https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2016/05/31/missing-cause-areas/\"><span>Missing Cause Areas</span></a><span>, on how what have thus far been the priority focus areas of effective altruism (EA) appear historically contingent. From their post:</span></div>\n</div>\n<blockquote>\n<div><span>Global poverty seems to be the least historically contingent cause area: if Peter Singer&#x2019;s Famine, Affluence, and Morality didn&#x2019;t get people to help people in the developing world, Peter Unger or any of the other people working with similar ideas would have. The popularity of animal rights, however, is clearly connected to the fact that Peter Singer, a prominent early effective altruist, wrote Animal Liberation, one of the foundational books of the animal rights movement. He carried over a significant amount of his fanbase from animal rights into effective altruism.</span>&#xA0;</div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>As a cause area, existential risk reduction seems to be solely a product of Eliezer Yudkowsky, a tireless promoter of effective altruism who researches the risks of artificial general intelligence. In my experience, interest in other kinds of existential risk among effective altruists appears to be primarily a product of people who accept Eliezer&#x2019;s arguments about the importance of the far future and existential risk, but who are skeptical about the importance of the specific issue of artificial general intelligence.</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>Existential risk reduction, global poverty, and animal rights all seem to me to be important issues. But &#x201C;global poverty, plus the pet issues of people who got a lot of people into EA&#x201D; doesn&#x2019;t seem to me to be a cause-area-finding mechanism that eliminates blind spots. I ask myself: what are we missing?</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>The most obvious thing we&#x2019;re missing, of course, is politics. I can hear all of my readers groaning now, because &#x201C;effective altruism doesn&#x2019;t pay enough attention to politics&#x201D; is the single most tired criticism of effective altruism in the entire world. I do think, however, it is trotted out ad nauseam because it has a point. There is a significant gap in effective altruism for structural change in between &#x201C;buy bed nets&#x201D; and &#x201C;literally build God&#x201D;. And while development in Africa is a fiendishly difficult topic, so are wild-animal suffering and preventing existential risk, and effective altruists seem to have mostly approached the latter with an attitude of &#x201C;challenge accepted&#x201D;.</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>(It&#x2019;s possible, however, that development is not sufficiently neglected for effective altruists to improve the situation much? I don&#x2019;t know enough to have an opinion on the issue.)</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>However, the most interesting question of blind spots, to me, is not that. The three primary cause areas of effective altruism are all advocating for particular groups of beings who are commonly overlooked: the global poor, animals, and people who don&#x2019;t yet exist. The question arises: what beings are effective altruists overlooking?</span></div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>\n<div><span><br>Indeed, effective altruists joke the four focus areas of EA come from </span><a title=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/4k/four_focus_areas_of_effective_altruism/\" href=\"/ea/4k/four_focus_areas_of_effective_altruism/\"><span>this one blog post</span></a><span> Luke Muehlhauser wrote as a </span><span>description </span><span>of the nascent EA movement, but we all took it as a </span><span>prescription</span><span> for what EA was supposed to be all about. However, EA&apos;s 3 major focus areas aren&apos;t </span><span>that</span><span> historically contingent. In &apos;</span><a title=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/rw/causes_in_effective_altruism/\" href=\"/ea/rw/causes_in_effective_altruism/\"><span>Why do effective altruists support the causes we do?</span></a><span>&apos;, Michelle Hutchinson from the Centre for Effective Altruism (CEA) provides a framework explaining how while to begin with EA&apos;s 3 major focus areas were due to historical precedent, they fit into a framework seemingly exhausting the space of possible beneficiaries for effective interventions to be focused on. From Michelle&apos;s post:</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n</div>\n<blockquote>\n<div><span>I think the reason is that our current delineation of causes cuts along beneficiary lines: present humans, non-human animals, and future conscious beings. Some of the most significant insights of effective altruism in terms of finding more effective ways to help others have come from highlighting different beneficiary groups. Since the groups above seem to exhaust the space of beneficiaries (if what we care about is well-being), we can&#x2019;t expect to get more effectiveness improvements in this way. In future, such improvements will have to come from finding new interventions, or intervention types. These are harder to find, and likely to lead to fewer orders of magnitude improvement. This post is on how the current &#x2018;causes in EA&#x2019; seem to arise from distinguishing beneficiary groups. In a follow up I&#x2019;ll discuss what the implications of that might be in terms of our likelihood of finding more effective causes.</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>&#x2018;Cause&#x2019; is a very fuzzy term. If you think of the different things that we tend to talk about as causes, they actually seem to fall in different categories. Take the causes &#x2018;alleviating global poverty&#x2019; and &#x2018;structural change&#x2019;. These are sometimes described as alternatives to each other, yet structural change seems more naturally a way to achieve the alleviation of poverty. This is likewise true of the cause &#x2018;meta&#x2019;. This fuzziness increases all the more what could fall into the category of &#x2018;causes we could be supporting&#x2019;, and makes it all the more surprising that there would be three singled out.</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>Distinguishing groups of beneficiaries</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>The starting point of effective altruism is increasing well-being: not just of those close to and similar to us, but all over the world and into the future. EA activities therefore fall into three groups: helping </span><span>people currently existing</span><span>, helping </span><span>non-human animals</span><span>, and helping </span><span>future conscious beings</span><span>. This maps out the whole space of possible effective altruism activities. There are altruistic activities which fall outside this grouping &#x2013; for example, working to improve biodiversity for its own sake. But these don&#x2019;t improve anyone&#x2019;s well-being, and so fall outside the scope of effective altruism.</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;<span><br>There are other ways to group beneficiaries than the 3 categories above. You might distinguish simply between existing sentient beings and future sentient beings. Or you might draw finer distinctions, such as between non-human animals whose suffering is caused by humans and wild animals.</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>There are several reasons for using the three-fold distinction amongst beneficiaries: </span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>The groups are systematically different in how much information we have about their cost-effectiveness: We have first-hand experience of how good it is to help other humans, while it&#x2019;s more difficult to know how to compare helping humans to helping other animals. Interventions that help others in the present can typically be tested for how well they work, unlike interventions aimed at the future.</span></div>\n<div><span>The kinds of things which will help the various groups will typically be somewhat more similar to each other than to those which help others of the groups. </span></div>\n<div><span>These distinctions are typically drawn quite strongly in people&#x2019;s minds, and they represent different ways in which humanity&#x2019;s moral circle could do with being widened - to people spatially far away, to people temporally far away, and to species other than our own.</span></div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>However, this leaves a fourth now-conventional EA focus area: &quot;meta&quot; or metacharity. &apos;Meta&apos; is a category apparently including everything from cause-neutral or cause-specific charity evaluation to EA movement growth. The object-level focus areas of EA are </span><a title=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HsznWM9A7NiuGsp28/extensions-and-intensions\" href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HsznWM9A7NiuGsp28/extensions-and-intensions\"><span>intensionally defined</span></a><span>: they&apos;re about the global poor of the present generation; future generations over long timescales; and farm animals, respectively. Whatever an organization associated with EA </span><span>actually does</span><span>, as long as its mission is focused on one of EA&apos;s 3 key focus areas, everyone understands how it fits into EA. Metacharity as a focus area defies this paradigm because of the diversity of metacharities&apos; activities within EA, and because they&apos;re not united by a common and concrete theme. </span></div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>They&apos;re united by a common </span><span>abstract</span><span> theme though. If we go for an </span><a title=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HsznWM9A7NiuGsp28/extensions-and-intensions\" href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/HsznWM9A7NiuGsp28/extensions-and-intensions\"><span>extensional</span><span> definition</span></a><span> of metacharity, if we point at what metacharities </span><span>do</span><span>, we can make more sense of them. The role of metacharities in effective altruism is to play a support or leadership role for various activities throughout the movement. Metacharities can either be cause-neutral or cause-specific, although in practice metacharities tend to select causes along specific lines. That&apos;s pretty abstract, but it&apos;s a modular add-on to the typical model of EA as having 3 focus areas. Many EA organizations can be described as playing a support or leadership role for the EA movement as a whole, or one of its constituent focus areas, thus fitting this definition:</span></div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div><a title=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/\" href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/\"><span>Animal Charity Evaluators</span></a></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div><a title=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\" href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\"><span>The Centre for Effective Altruism</span></a></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div><a title=\"https://ea-foundation.org/\" href=\"https://ea-foundation.org/\"><span>The Effective Altruism Foundation</span></a></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div><a title=\"https://rtcharity.org/\" href=\"https://rtcharity.org/\"><span>Rethink Charity</span></a></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div><a title=\"http://charityscience.org/\" href=\"http://charityscience.org/\"><span>Charity Science</span></a></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div><a title=\"https://www.givewell.org/\" href=\"https://www.givewell.org/\"><span>Givewell</span></a></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div><a title=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/\" href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/\"><span>The Open Philanthropy Project</span></a></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div><a title=\"https://futureoflife.org/\" href=\"https://futureoflife.org/\"><span>The Future of Life Institute</span></a></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div><a title=\"http://rationality.org/\" href=\"http://rationality.org/\"><span>The Center for Applied Rationality</span></a></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<div><span>If not EA organizations themselves, for years the likes of the </span><a title=\"https://intelligence.org/\" href=\"https://intelligence.org/\"><span>Machine Intelligence Research Institute</span></a><span>, the </span><a title=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/\" href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/\"><span>Future of Humanity Institute</span></a><span> and Givewell&apos;s and Animal Charity Evaluators&apos; (ACE) top-recommended and standout charities can and have been aptly described as EA-&quot;adjacent&quot;. If EA(-adjacent) organizations aren&apos;t focused on one of EA&apos;s 3 object-level focus areas, they&apos;re focused on the EA community itself. The activity of cause-neutral leadership or support roles for the whole EA community distinct from any one of its 3 object-level focus area has emerged as a genuine category in EA as the relevant organizations have matured and professionalized. This is reflected in the switch from the abstract language of &apos;metacharity&apos; to the use of the more precise &apos;EA movement-/community-building&apos;, and the &apos;</span><a title=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/effective-altruism-funds-options/#effective-altruism-community\\\" href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/effective-altruism-funds-options/#effective-altruism-community\\\"><span>EA Community Fund</span></a><span>.&apos; With this view of EA community and meta-level organizations combined with Michelle&apos;s model of beneficiary groups, we have a representation of EA explaining how its primary foci up until now aren&apos;t merely outputs of mere historical contingencies.

An Operational Definition of Global Catastrophe</span></em></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div><span>In the </span><span>Introduction</span><span> to </span><a title=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2659696-global-catastrophic-risks?from_search=true\" href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2659696-global-catastrophic-risks?from_search=true\"><span>Global Catastrophic Risks</span></a><span>, </span><a title=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bostrom\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nick_Bostrom\"><span>Nick Bostrom</span></a><span> provides a taxonomy for organizing global catastrophic risks.</span></div>\n</div>\n<blockquote>\n<div><span> Let us look more closely at what would, and would not, count as a global catastrophic risk. Recall that the damage caused must be serious, and the scale global. Given this, a catastrophe that caused 10,000 fatalities or 10 billion dollars worth of economic damage (e.g., a major earthquake) would not qualify as a global catastrophe. A catastrophe that caused 10 million fatalities worth of economic loss (e.g., an influenza pandemic) would count as a global catastrophe, even if some region of the world escaped unscathed. As for disasters falling between these points, the definition is vague. The stipulation of a precise cut-off does not appear needful at this stage.</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span> Global catastrophes have occurred many times in history, even if we only count the disasters causing more than 10 million deaths. A very partial list of examples might include the An Shi Rebellion (756-763), the Taiping Rebellion (1851-1864), and the famine of the Great Leap Forward in China, the Black Death in Europe, the Spanish flu pandemic, the two world wars, the Nazi genocides, the famines of British India, Stalinist totalitarianism, the decimation of the native American population through smallpox and other diseases following the arrival of European colonizers, probably the Mongol conquests, perhaps the Belgian Congo--innumerable others could be added to the list depending on how various misfortunes and chronic conditions are individuated and classified.</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span> We can roughly characterize the severity of risk by three variables; its </span><span>scope</span><span> (how many people - and other morally relevant beings - would be affected), its </span><span>intensity</span><span> (how badly these would be affected), and its </span><span>probability</span><span> (how likely the disaster is to occur, according to our best judgement, given currently available evidence). Using the first two of these variables, we can construct a qualitative diagram of different types of risk (Fig 1.1). (The probability dimension could be displayed along a z-axis were this diagram three-dimensional).</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span> The scope of a risk can be </span><span>personal</span><span> (affecting one person), </span><span>local</span><span> (affecting a large part of the human population), or </span><span>trans-generational</span><span> (affecting not only the current world population but all generations that could come to exist in the future). The intensity of the risk can be classified as imperceptible (barely noticeable), endurable (causing significant harm but not destroying quality of life completely), or terminal (causing death or permanently and drastically reducing quality of life). In this taxonomy, global catastrophic risks occupy the four risk classes in the high-severity upper-right corner of the figure: a global catastrophic risk is of either global or trans-generational scope, and of either endurable or terminal intensity. In principle, as suggested in the figure, the axes can be extended to encompass conceptually possible risks that are even more extreme. In particular, trans-generational risks can contain a subclass of risks so destructive that their realization would not only affect or pre-empt future human generations, but would also destroy the potential of our future light cone of the universe to produce intelligent or self-aware beings (labelled &#x2018;Cosmic&#x2019;). On the other hand, according to many theories of value there can be states of being that are even worse than non-existence or death (e.g., permanent and extreme forms of slavery or mind control), so it could, in principle, be possible to extend the x-axis to the right as well (see Fig. 1.1 labelled &#x2018;Hellish&#x2019;).</span></div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>\n<div><span><img src=\"https://globalriskresearch.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/1m41oxq.png\" alt=\"1m41oxq\"></span></div>\n</div>\n<blockquote>\n<div><span> A subset of global catastrophic risks is </span><span>existential risks</span><span>. An existential risk is one that threatens to cause the extinction of Earth-originating intelligent life or to reduce its quality of life (compared to what would otherwise have been possible) permanently and drastically. Existential risks share a number of features that mark them out as deserving of special consideration. For example, since it is not possible to recover from existential risks, we cannot allow even one existential disaster to happen; there would be no opportunity to learn from experience. Our approach to managing such risks must be proactive. How much worse an existential catastrophe would be than a non-existential global catastrophe depends very sensitively on controversial issues in value theory, in particular how much weight to give to the lives of possible future persons. Furthermore, assessing existential risks raises the distinctive methodological problems having to do with observation selection effects and the need to avoid anthropic bias. </span></div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>\n<div><span>Nick also elaborates how other catastrophes which aren&apos;t at risk of happening, but are already </span><span>ongoing global catastrophes</span><span>, fit into this framework. </span></div>\n</div>\n<blockquote>\n<div><span> One major current global catastrophic risk is infectious pandemic disease. As noted earlier, infectious disease causes approximately 15 million deaths per year, of which 75% occur in Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. These dismal statistics pose a challenge to the classification of pandemic disease as a global catastrophic risk. One could argue that infectious disease is not so much a </span><span>risk</span><span> such as an </span><span>ongoing global catastrophe</span><span>. Even on a more fine-grained individuation of the hazard, based on specific infectious agents, at least some of the currently occurring pandemics (such as HIV/AIDS, which causes nearly 3 million deaths annually) would presumably qualify as global catastrophes. By similar reckoning, one could argue cardiovascular (responsible for approximately 30% of world mortality, or 18 million deaths per year) and cancer (8 million deaths) are also ongoing global catastrophes. It would be perverse if the study of possible catastrophes that </span><span>could</span><span> occur were to drain attention away from actual catastrophes that </span><span>are</span><span> occurring. It is also appropriate, at this juncture, to reflect for a moment on the biggest cause of death and disability of all, namely ageing, which accounts for perhaps two-thirds of the 57 million deaths that occur each year, along with an enormous loss of health and human capital. If ageing were not certain but merely probable, it would immediately shoot to the top of any list of global catastrophic risks. Yet the fact that ageing is not just a possible cause of future death, but a certain cause of present death, should not trick us into trivializing the matter. To the extent that we have a realistic prospect of mitigating the problem - for example, by disseminating information about healthier lifestyles or by investing more heavily in biogerontological research - we may be able to save a much larger expected number of lives (or quality-adjusted life-years) by making partial progress on this problem than by completely eliminating some of the global catastrophic risks discussed in this volume. </span></div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>\n<div><span>The &quot;hellish&quot; scenario Nick describes can be found in s-risks.

Simply put, the focus areas of EA are based on identifying global catastrophes negatively impacting well-being of moral patients, however defined, that are inter-generational in scope, and terminal in their intensity. These problems are most often addressed by a solution of applying emerging technologies making solving these problems possible like never before in history. That this model broad and robust is evidenced by the fact is was also a driving force in precursor movements to EA, such as transhumanism and rationality.</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div><span>Why it&apos;s important effective altruism as a community has an accurate map of the territory it&apos;s creating is because if we don&apos;t it leaves us </span><a title=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/12z/concerns_with_intentional_insights/\" href=\"/ea/12z/concerns_with_intentional_insights/\"><span>open to exploitation</span></a><span>. In September 2016, Ian David Moss of </span><a title=\"http://createquity.com/\" href=\"http://createquity.com/\"><span>Createquity</span></a><span> posted on the Effective Altruism Forum about how </span><a title=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/120/all_causes_are_ea_causes/\" href=\"/ea/120/all_causes_are_ea_causes/\"><span>All causes are EA causes</span></a><span>. In his post, Ian made the following argument:<br><br></span></div>\n</div>\n<blockquote>\n<div><span>Finally, embracing domain-specific effective altruism diversifies the portfolio of potential impact for effective altruism. Even within the EA movement currently, there are disagreements about the highest-potential causes to champion. Indeed, one could argue that domain-specific effective altruist organizations already exist. Take, for example, Animal Charity Evaluators (ACE) or the Machine Intelligence Research Institute (MIRI), both of which </span><a title=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/get-involved/\" href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/get-involved/\"><span>are considered effective altruist organizations</span></a><span> by the Centre for Effective Altruism. Animal welfare and the development of &#x201C;friendly&#x201D; artificial intelligence are both considered </span><a title=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/hx4/four_focus_areas_of_effective_altruism/\" href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/hx4/four_focus_areas_of_effective_altruism/\"><span>causes of interest</span></a><span> for the EA movement. But how should they be evaluated against each other? And more to the point, if it were conclusively determined that friendly AI was the optimal cause to focus on, would ACE and other animal welfare EA charities shut down to avoid diverting attention and resources away from friendly AI? Or vice versa?</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>The reality, as most EAs will admit, is that virtually all estimates of the expected impact of various interventions are rife with uncertainty. Small adjustments to core assumptions or the emergence of new information can change those calculations dramatically. Even a risk-friendly investor would be considered insane to bank her entire asset base with a single company or industry, and if anything, the information available in the social realm is far less plentiful and precise than is the case in business. Particularly as the EA movement seeks to grow in influence, the idea of risk mitigation is going to become increasingly applicable.</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>[...]</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>Effective altruism is a truly transformative idea that has the potential to improve billions of lives &#x2013; but the movement&#x2019;s rhetoric and ideology is currently limiting that potential in very significant ways. The few, wonderful people who are prepared to embrace any cause in the name of global empathy should be treasured and cultivated. But solely relying on them to change the world is very likely a losing strategy. If effective altruists can come up with ways to </span><span>additionally</span><span> engage those who want to maximize their impact but are not prepared to abandon causes and geographies they care about deeply, that could be the difference between EA ending up as a footnote to history or the world-changing social force it seeks to be.</span></div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>To be clear, I&apos;m not saying Ian is doing anything to exploit EA, and I agree that more effectiveness should be brought into the world of art philanthropy, and when that&apos;s done, those art philanthropists should feel free to call themselves effective altruists. Indeed, I engaged with Ian&apos;s post at length. But he was making broader claims about EA, and challenged effective altruists to accept the external criticism as valid: that all causes are EA causes. While all causes may have </span><span>the potential</span><span> to be EA causes, to point at anti-malarial insecticide-treated bednets; corporate campaigns against battery cages for egg-laying hens; and AI alignment research and say &quot;</span><span>these are entirely historically contingent cause selections! You have no right to deny me the franchise of EA because EA is nothing but a coalition of convenience and some hand-wavy optimization processes!&quot; </span><span>is something that should give effective altruists pause.</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div><span>But if there is no common thread or common ground, it&apos;s easier for entryists who want to peel off left-leaning or right-leaning activist-minded effective altruists into their partisan movements for &quot;systemic change&quot;, as if EA isn&apos;t already about changing systems. A conflict which could threaten to divide EA might succeed in doing so if there is no sense of something uniting the disparate causes of effective altruism. The task of ruling in or out what causes may or may not be effective as EA grows and expands in scope is less daunting if we know where EA is really coming from to begin with. We can create as common knowledge in EA a lodestone to bring us back to centre, and remind us ours is a </span><a title=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6hfGNLf4Hg5DXqJCF/a-fable-of-science-and-politics\" href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/6hfGNLf4Hg5DXqJCF/a-fable-of-science-and-politics\"><span>fable of science and not politics</span></a><span>.</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div><a title=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/9s/effective_altruism_is_a_question_not_an_ideology/\" href=\"/ea/9s/effective_altruism_is_a_question_not_an_ideology/\"><span>Effective altruism is a question, not an ideology</span></a><span>. </span><a title=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/132/setting_community_norms_and_values_a_response_to/\" href=\"/ea/132/setting_community_norms_and_values_a_response_to/\"><span>Norms and values</span></a><span> and a profession to ask the question &apos;how can I do the most good?&apos; are fine things, but they&apos;re not foolproof, and they&apos;re not precise. If something walked like an effective focus area, and talked like an effective focus area, we could be more confident if a focus area was effective. And some questions to ask for figuring out what that looks like are:</span></div>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<div><em>What group of beneficiaries do the moral patients we&apos;re trying to help belong to?</em></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div><em>Is the negative impact on their well-being from the problem we&apos;ve identified global and trans-generational in scope?</em></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div><em>Is the negative impact on well-being of this problem terminal in intensity?</em></div>\n</li>\n<li>\n<div><em>Do the probabilities of the variables (e.g., scope, intensity, moral weight, criterion for &quot;well-being&quot; or &quot;moral patienthood&quot;, etc.) we assign in our model of the problem make it competitive with existing causes in effective altruism?</em></div>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div>\n<div><span>Effective altruists can use competing reference classes, cost-benefit analyses and expected value estimates to hammer out whose probability assignments to what variables in what models were the most well-calibrated all along to determine how to do the most good. But all effective altruists can share the assumption the most important problems to solve are to mitigate the risk of global, trans-generational and terminal threats to the well-being of a population of beneficiaries, be that population human or non-human; living in the present or (possibly) the future.</span></div>\n</div>\n<div><hr></div>\n<div>\n<div><em><span>IV. Conclusion</span></em></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div><span>Michelle wrote a follow-up to her post about why effective altruists support the causes we do: </span><a title=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/s0/finding_more_effective_causes/\" href=\"/ea/s0/finding_more_effective_causes/\"><span>Finding more effective causes</span></a><span>. Does the broader framework I&apos;ve posited encompasses and explains everything EA has ever focused upon thus far find more effective causes than Michelle expected? From Michelle&apos;s post:</span></div>\n</div>\n<blockquote>\n<div><span>Here are two toy models for how effective altruism might have thus far looked for the most effective causes.</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>Model 1:</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>From all the ways of helping others we can find, we hone in on those which seem most effective. We then investigate them in more detail to work out which seem most promising to work on. Some of the interventions effective altruism focuses on are quite surprising, so we shouldn&#x2019;t think of this as looking at a series of interventions that are already described: we&#x2019;re precisely looking for ones that haven&#x2019;t been. On a model like this, the effectiveness of the interventions we&#x2019;ll find in the future is quite a mystery, and it seems likely that for some time to come most of our efforts should go into trying to find the new, more effective causes.</span><br><br></div>\n<div><span>Model 2:</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>We systematically expand our circle of caring to groups people tend to neglect, and doing so has highlights novel ways to help others. People tend to care about those close by and similar to them. Over history, the circle of those we care about has gradually widened - for example in coming to understand racism as an evil. You might think that what effective altruism has tried to do is continue this progression - persuading people that they should help not just those in their country, but also on the other side of the world; not just those of their own species but all sentient creatures; not just people currently existing but any people whose lives we can affect. Then in each of those cases it tried to find the most effective way to help that group.</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>It seems unlikely that either of these models accurately represent how effective altruism has come to focus on the causes it does. But some of the biggest insights of effective altruism do seem to have come from expanding our circle of caring. The importance of preventing events which could severely affect those in the future for the worse, after all, follows naturally after the realisation that the wellbeing of those in the future matters as much as that of current people.</span></div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>\n<div><span><br>Model 1</span><span> is indeed inaccurate in the wake of a the new framework. From within this framework, what bridges what effective altruists have done, what they&apos;re starting to do and what to expect we&apos;ll do in the future is no longer a mystery. </span><span>Model 2</span><span> is still likelier to fit. A fourth group of beneficiaries Michelle&apos;s original three missed out on is future generations of non-human populations. The Hedonistic Imperative and s-risk reduction both target these populations unlike the other focus areas of EA, aimed at suffering trans-generational in scope and terminal in intensity. </span></div>\n</div>\n<blockquote>\n<div><span>1. New beneficiary groups</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>Finding subgroups of these three beneficiary groups, or finding groups that cut across these groups, may highlight new effective ways of helping others. (H/t Daniel Dewey for this point). &#x2018;People currently in extreme poverty&#x2019; is an example of a sub-group (of &#x2018;current people&#x2019;) while &#x2018;people prone to depression&#x2019; is an example of a group that cuts across current and future people. Identifying such a group might be useful because a it is neglected compared to others. Eg typically animal welfare activists do not work on the suffering of wild animals, so identifying that sub-group as worth helping was novel. Or identifying such a group might be useful because there there is some particular way to help that group, which is highlighted by identifying the group. Eg specifically considering the category &#x2018;animals in factory farms&#x2019;.</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>In some cases, identifying these groups highlights more effective interventions within a cause, such as concentrating on ending factory farming within the cause of animal rights. In other cases, it may suggest a new cause as being effective, as might be the case with trying to find a cure to depression (I&#x2019;m not clear here whether the cause would be &#x2018;medical research&#x2019;, &#x2018;improving mental health across the world&#x2019; or what).</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>2. New methods</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0; Alternatively, we might be to find new methods to help our three main beneficiary groups. That might lead to new causes for us to focus on. For example - perhaps it is possible to breed animals with a higher happiness set point, and we should be trying to forward that research rather than only working to alleviate suffering among animals. In other cases it might suggest more effective interventions within causes we already focus on. Eg developing a cheaper way to purify water, or a more effective way to raise money to fight poverty.</span></div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>While the identification of new beneficiary groups has gone further than Michelle posited, whether its through mental health, anti-aging, RWAS, or biosecurity, the expansion of EA beyond its original 3 focus areas is indeed more predicated on finding new methods to help those prior identified groups of beneficiary populations than newly identified groups.</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n</div>\n<blockquote>\n<div><span>The fact that expanding the circle of caring yielded such gains in effectiveness, and that it probably won&#x2019;t yield more, makes it somewhat unlikely that we will be able to find another cause which eclipses the ones we currently focus on. On the other hand, finding new groupings of beneficiaries and new methods for helping beneficiary groups both seem promising ways to find more effective causes.</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>Our chance of finding a far more effective intervention depends in part on what overall class of beneficiaries we&#x2019;re looking at and how neglected they tend to be. E.g. Animals tend to get less attention than humans &#x2013; that plausibly explains why the suffering of wild animals has not previously been thought to be of moral importance. Any group that includes currently existing people in rich countries, on the other hand, is comparatively likely to have had quite a bit of work put into it. </span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n<div><span>Where there hasn&#x2019;t been, that will often be for reasons which make it rather intractable. E.g. there may be a strong lobby against an intervention, or it may require an untenable level of cooperation among diverse bodies. There seem to be some cases for which doesn&#x2019;t hold though: you might think that human enhancements (as opposed to treatments of health problems), e.g. trying to slow ageing, have been neglected for the most part simply due to a perception that we don&#x2019;t need them.</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;<span><br>Relatedly, although effective altruism may have been useful in the past in highlighting particularly effective interventions within crowded areas, that does not mean it will in future. Past work by effective altruism in such areas has built on decades of research - whether by bodies like the WHO and the World Bank or by academia. Much of the value-add has been looking at the big picture of the interventions they&#x2019;ve researched, and picking out the most effective ones. There might be interventions they entirely overlooked, but it&#x2019;s more likely that improvements will come simply from some interventions being a bit better than they looked. This means the initial gains will have been far faster than subsequent ones.</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;<span><br>With neglected areas like the far future, the story seems different. Because there has been little research done by others it&#x2019;s more plausible that there are interventions we&#x2019;ve never yet considered. I don&#x2019;t know how to think about their likely value compared to those that we have. E.g. risks from AI seem quite major, potentially somewhat close in the future (~100 years?) and potentially tractable (e.g. by talking to the people doing the research), so it seems a high bar to surpass. But that&#x2019;s not to say that we can&#x2019;t: particularly if we could (say) find some way to improve society such that it was more robust to all possible disasters.</span></div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>\n<div><span>Within a framework of applying emerging technologies to mitigating extant or potential global catastrophes, with a willingness to go beyond building on decades of research to advance and develop new science to solve those problems, I believe EA will be useful in the future as it has been in the past. The story is the same as it is for the far future; not enough research has been done in all areas of EA because there are interventions effective altruists will consider nobody else will to help those most in need.</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div><span>EA is crucial to the future because Michelle&apos;s examples aren&apos;t merely plausible. </span><span>They&apos;re real</span><span>. Effective altruism is the only movement considering the moral importance of wild animals; treating both health problems and working on human enhancements to slow ageing; working on bringing more attention and expanding the moral circle to those populations of even humans still living today whose well-being has been disproportionately neglected for generations, condemning to death or worse fates of suffering; </span><span>and</span><span> rendering the solutions to these problems more tractable by lobbying for those interventions and coordinating those diverse bodies that would otherwise be against them, on top of everything else.</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;</div>\n</div>\n<div>\n<div><span>To help groups of beneficiary populations whose well-being is threatened to a inter-generational scope and terminal degree is the pole holding up the broad tent of effective altruism. Now may it never fall down. Two years ago, I wrote</span><a title=\"https://www.facebook.com/evangaensbauer/posts/10154412857778554\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/evangaensbauer/posts/10154412857778554\"><span> this Facebook post</span></a><span>:</span></div>\n</div>\n<blockquote>\n<div><span>I didn&apos;t become part of effective altruism for what it ever was in the present, but what it could become. I wasn&apos;t raised in a tradition of charity. I was raised in the traditions of how ingenuity can be uplifting for the human condition, and how clear thinking can lead the conscience and the seek for justice, not the other way around. My family values were those of aspiring rationality. Apparently unlike most, I wasn&apos;t first drawn to rationality and skepticism because I found a community which for the first time in my life could fill an unnamed yearning. I joined because it simply felt like home. The culture of individualistic intellect and using enlightenment to provide that opportunity to anyone everyone is my native tribe.</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;<span><br>That effective altruism hasn&apos;t been like this has led to what I think are rightful reservations about it. Pious virtue signaling dressed up as anything turns off worthy iconoclasts. If you couldn&apos;t tell, that&apos;s why I&apos;m indifferent to expressing it myself. In my more shortsighted and dreary moments, I neglect to cultivate the virtue I feel is important in my personal life because I feel it&apos;s pointless to try for myself if even what still seems the most promising movement on Earth loses itself to flash at the cost of substance.</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;<span><br>This is changing. Effective altruism will always contain donation as an aspect, but the throwing of money at problems which, rightly or wrongly, rings hollow for so many, will soon cease to be its strongest pillar. This year at Effective Altruism Global things were different. The whole community is different We are going from purchasing bednets to destroying the world&apos;s deadliest monster&apos;s with gene drives. We are going from small cash transfers to entrepreneurs empowering people to pull themselves out of poverty, and running the biggest RCTs on basic income in history. We&apos;re backing all the biotech startups engineering cultured substitutes for every thinkable animal-agriculture product. We are wholesale embracing the teachings of scholars who have over thirty years years discovered and designed the exciting science of predicting the future. We&apos;re not only looking athow to transform societies with robustly evidence-based policies, but learning from experienced professionals on how to build the intellectual supply chain to get it done, from building coalitions to influencing policymakers to intellectual to running more experiments.</span></div>\n<div>&#xA0;<span><br>Effective altruism is finally becoming what I signed up for. Let&apos;s keep it up. They say excited altruism is effective altruism. Let&apos;s get excited for effectiveness. Let&apos;s go beyond that. Let&apos;s become overwhelmingly effective. Maniacally effective. Titanically and bombastically and ballistically effective.

This kicks off BERI&#x2019;s larger Individual Grants Program, which we intend to write about in more detail later. Below, we explain the types of projects that qualify and how to apply for this round.</p>\n<h1>What is a &#x201C;Project Grant&#x201D; ?</h1>\n<p>BERI Project Grants fund individuals to work on projects directly relevant to&#xA0;<a href=\"http://existence.org/\">BERI&#x2019;s mission</a>, when those individuals would need less oversight than a typical contractor would need to ensure the value of their work to our mission.</p>\n<p>Projects can vary widely in scope and cost. A few examples of projects that BERI could imagine funding include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Writing a book, research paper, or other materials.</li>\n<li>Providing operations support to existing x-risk focused organizations or individuals for a set amount of time.</li>\n<li>Developing a high-quality educational video.</li>\n<li>Forming a reading group for x-risk-motivated STEM students.</li>\n<li>Organizing a conference, talk, or workshop.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We are open to any ideas you have, as long as you can explain how the project will contribute to improving human civilization&#x2019;s long-term prospects for survival and flourishing.</p>\n<p>In some cases, a grant will give an individual the freedom to reduce their time-commitment to their current role, and spend their remaining time investigating or working on existential risk reduction in a serious way, with funding from BERI. In other cases, individuals may not have prior time-commitments, but will be motivated to use their free time to work on an existential-risk reducing project.</p>\n<p>If you are interested in applying for a BERI Project Grant, please fill out our&#xA0;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/125o40K_dv7yLRxvZ26Mg3tDTTm6Gxmc3cCQxDEigOw0/viewform?edit_requested=true\">online application form</a>&#xA0;by June 30th.</p>\n<h1>Amounts</h1>\n<p>We expect that the budgets for most Project Grants will include both a) project expenses and b) a salary to compensate the applicant for their time.</p>\n<p>Amounts awarded will range depending on the scope of the project and the time commitment from the applicant. The maximum any applicant can receive for a full-time project is $300,000 per year (this includes both project expenses and salary), multiplied by their percentage time commitment. This means that, with a 20% time commitment to the grant (one 8-hour day per week), the maximum amount an applicant could receive would be 20%*$300,000 = $60,000 per year.</p>\n<p>Annualized amounts over $150,000 are not available as salary to the grantee. For example, with a 40% time commitment to the grant, amounts over 40%*$150,000 = $60,000 must be used for project expenses.</p>\n<p><span>Note:</span>&#xA0;The grantee may elect for BERI to retain a portion of their grant, to be used by BERI for non-salary expenses in support of their project (so the grantee does not receive that portion as income). For example, the retained portion could be used to reimburse the grantee for tax-exempt project expenses following BERI&#x2019;s Procurement Policy, or to pay contractors assisting with the project.</p>\n<h1>Eligibility</h1>\n<p>Applicants from any country are eligible. Please note that the application process will be conducted in English. Given this, we only expect to provide grants to candidates with working English proficiency.</p>\n<h1>Time Commitment Restrictions</h1>\n<p>Individuals are not eligible to receive a BERI Project grant if they are unable to negotiate an expected combined time commitment of &#x2264; 50 hours/week to BERI and their other employer(s) combined.</p>\n<p>If offered a grant, and if the grant would cause the applicant to fulfill less than their current time commitment to their current employer(s), the applicant must be willing to openly negotiate a reduced time commitment to their current employer(s). In this case, we request a written notice from the employer(s) agreeing to the reduced time commitment for the duration of the grant.</p>\n<h1>Selection</h1>\n<p>Grant winners will be chosen by an anonymous selection committee comprising at least three people, each with at least one year of leadership, management, or research experience with an institution focusing on ensuring humanity&#x2019;s long-term survival and flourishing. At least 21% of the committee will come from outside of BERI. The committee will rank-order projects and award grants to the top-ranked projects falling within our budget ($750,000). We may adjust the budget based on the quality of applications.</p>\n<h1>Requirements and Supervision</h1>\n<p>BERI Project grantees are required to complete their project or, in the case of non-completion, provide a report to BERI transparently explaining the difficulties they encountered and what they learned. If BERI does not feel that a strong effort was made to complete the project, and the learnings from failure were not particularly valuable, BERI may require that the grant funding be returned. However, grantees should be reassured that BERI considers exploratory work to be valuable and learning from failure to be a generally acceptable outcome of ventures with a high expected value. A Grant Investigator will be assigned to each project to ensure grant requirements are met.</p>\n<h1>Intellectual Property and Grantee Independence</h1>\n<p>The grant project may be treated as a collaboration with the grantee&#x2019;s current employer, if the grantee requests it in their application. In this case, the grantee must be treated as an independent collaborator by their current employer, for the time commitment allotted to them by the grant project. BERI allows this in case the applicant&#x2019;s current employer could provide them with valuable resources and opportunities useful to their project.</p>\n<p>If the grantee&#x2019;s current employer is a public charity or university, BERI&#xA0;<a href=\"http://existence.org/faq#ip\">concedes all intellectual property rights</a>&#xA0;to the applicant&#x2019;s current employer. BERI does this to simplify negotiations between the applicant and their employer, and because we view the accrual of knowledge relevant to existential risk within other public charities to be a valuable accomplishment.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, BERI is not able to concede all intellectual property rights to other kinds of employers. The applicant may, however, submit with their application an intellectual property agreement offer from their current employer with terms that are favorable to BERI and its mission, for the selection committee to consider in Phase 2 (see below).</p>\n<h1>Application Process</h1>\n<p><em><span>Phase 1:</span></em>&#xA0;<span>(Application deadline June 30, 2018, 11:59PM GMT-12:00)</span><br>Interested candidates apply online:&#xA0;<span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/125o40K_dv7yLRxvZ26Mg3tDTTm6Gxmc3cCQxDEigOw0/viewform?edit_requested=true\">Application Form for BERI Project Grants - Round 1</a></span></p>\n<p>Optionally, applicants may ask one or two people to use the following form to submit a recommendation for their application before the June 30th deadline:&#xA0;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Dan7AQ_zM4mSEAReX234X_iRXtmd_UnzA2zfxqaucSs/viewform?edit_requested=true\">Recommendation Form - BERI Project Grants - Round 1</a></p>\n<p><em><span>Phase 2:</span></em>&#xA0;(Begins by August 31)<br>Top applicants are notified that they have been chosen to receive grants, and given time to work with their current employers, if any, to negotiate a reduction in their time commitment and/or IP agreement between their employer and BERI, if needed for the grant.</p>\n<p>Shortlisted applicants are notified that they may be invited to Phase 2 if some top applicants fail within 4 weeks to acquire a time reduction and/or an intellectual property agreement acceptable to BERI.</p>\n<h1>Questions</h1>\n<p>If you have any questions please email contact@existence.org.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "rebecca_raible"}}, {"_id": "yLd2c2rg5Jrq9HR6K", "title": "Want to be more productive?

This has been a theme that has been coming up in public spaces as far back as winter solstice 2014. I have seen several attempts to mitigate this issue, but none have seemed to stick.</p>\n<p>Newcomers to the Berkeley community often find it difficult to become a part of the physical-space community&#x2014;likely because much of the socializing happening in private spaces such as group houses, meaning that people only invite the folks they already know and trust.</p>\n<p>There are LessWrong meetups in Berkeley and SF, and EA meetups in the South Bay, but travelling for at least an hour to get to a regular EA meetup felt too difficult to work into my schedule, and the Berkeley LW meetup hasn&#x2019;t felt like the right space for me.</p>\n<h3>The Hopes of Project Hufflepuff</h3>\n<p>In 2017, Ray Arnold ran the Hufflepuff Unconference. At that event, I volunteered to join the bay area rationalist Welcoming Committee. That group accomplished a few things in the attempt to make the bay area community more inviting:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Ensured that larger, more open events happened every few months (previously there was only 1 community-wide open event per year)</li>\n<li>Took over upkeep of the bayrationality.com website</li>\n<li>Created a&#xA0;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xDCH5KXgLYEqArKEFAQlJ-yZClK29Fk1D8GaiC28unA/edit\">document</a>&#xA0;with trigger action plans for being more welcoming</li>\n<li>Started a discussion around documenting group norms</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There were several other ideas which were discussed at the&#xA0;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tTm1U26I3HfO_4ie027TyB4rjd4leHPndXnZWeEAFhs/edit\">Project Hufflepuff meetings</a>, but those saw less traction. In several cases, there were ideas for specific events or meetup series, but these failed in part due to lack of a convenient hosting venue.</p>\n<p>These activities helped me see more of what was going on in the community, which led to me become the point person for new folks to contact (through the bayrationality site) when moving to the area or first getting involved. I found that many of them wanted to know how to get involved with the local EA and rationalist communities, but I didn&#x2019;t have a great answer for them beyond pointing to the meetup links that were already on the site. The best I could come up with given the state of social activities was to say something to the effect of &#x201C;Most of the interesting conversations happen at private events, but I can&#x2019;t really invite you to other people&#x2019;s events. Maybe we could meet up in person so I can get to know you so I can vouch for you?&#x201D; They rarely took me up on it, and I generally never heard from them again.</p>\n<h3>Personal Background and Community Ties</h3>\n<p>I have been around and in the rationalist and EA communities since 2014, during which I attended a CFAR workshop and volunteered at workshops both in Berkeley and the UK. I attended the 2014 EA Summit and have attended or volunteered at EA global every subsequent year. I worked as a software developer at CEA from September 2017 - February 2018.&#xA0;<br><br>Since 2015, I have lived in rationalist and rationalist-adjacent group houses in Berkeley which I have helped find, fund, and coordinate.</p>\n<h2>How I set up the Berkeley REACH</h2>\n<p>Throughout January and February 2018, I thought more about the community center idea and brought it up with several community members. Most agreed that such a project should happen but that it would be a lot of work. I was working at CEA at the time, and several of the other staff members thought that creating a community center might be a good idea. However, it neither fit into my role there, nor into CEA&#x2019;s role as the coordinators of the global community.</p>\n<h3>Finding A Space</h3>\n<p>On my own time, I started a regular weekly EA meetup in February. CFAR let me use their office to host the first few meetings, but I found the process of getting willing people in the door to be challenging (there was a sometimes-locked gate, a locked door, and a locked elevator between participants and the space -- multiple literal barriers to entry). I looked around for an alternate space to use and discovered that the first floor of Event Horizon (a rationalist group house), which had previously been Cafe la Renaissance (home of regular rationalist meetups before it closed, and home to the CFAR and MIRI office before it was a cafe), was going to become available soon. Seven months before, it had been hastily converted into a living space with 4 bedrooms. I decided that it would be a good venue for a trial of the sort of space I&#x2019;d been envisioning.</p>\n<h3>Initial Costs and Funding</h3>\n<p>Using my own money, I rented the space for the month of March for $4500. I started cleaning the space and buying snacks, office supplies, and other items to make it usable as a community center, amounting to about another $1000. I moved my weekly EA meetups to the space, and soon I had a few other recurring events set up as well as regular coworking hours.</p>\n<p>At this point, I applied for an&#xA0;<a href=\"/ea/1l3/announcing_effective_altruism_community_building/\">EA community building grant</a>. I heard back at the beginning of April that I had not gotten the grant, so I paid for April out of pocket as well. CEA&#x2019;s stated reasoning was that my newly formed EA group in Berkeley lacked a track record, and that my metrics for success or failure were not defined clearly enough.</p>\n<p>Shortly after receiving this news, I decided to attempt crowdfunding on&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/berkeleyreach\">Patreon</a>. I got signal boosted by slatestarcodex (thanks!),&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/PSAn7WGKCGhXet6A8/humans-need-places\">Ben Hoffman</a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/s6aqtrFeySP4TrKvJ/thoughts-on-the-reach-patreon\">Ray Arnold</a>&#xA0;and several folks on Facebook. In just over 2 weeks, we reached the first Patreon goal of $2,500/month, which in addition to money collected from people staying in the guest rooms or making&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.paypal.com/pools/c/82D4R5tnuG\">one-time donations</a>&#xA0;was barely enough to cover the rent on the space.</p>\n<p>I started talking to BERI about the possibility of a grant in early April, and recently heard back that I did not get it, at least partially because of not yet being a 501(c)(3). They have mentioned that their&#xA0;<a href=\"http://existence.org/grants\">newly announced project grants program</a>&#xA0;is explicitly more open to folks without 501(c)(3) status, and separately I&apos;ll be achieving that status soon, so I will definitely be applying to the new program.</p>\n<p>Since I currently don&apos;t have enough funding to pay for the space plus my time managing the space and I do need to pay my personal rent and other bills, I have taken on a part time (2 days per week) job, which means I have less time and mental capacity for running REACH operations than I would if I were able to do this as a full time job.</p>\n<h3>Other Resources</h3>\n<p>In May, a community member generously gifted the REACH with their old SUV.<br><br>Since then, I have worked to procure more/better furniture for the space (mostly cheap finds from Facebook Marketplace, picked up in the SUV). This has included a large bookshelf to house the many donated books for the shared library (currently using a paper-and-pen loan system which has to be entered into a spreadsheet -- a better system may be forthcoming).</p>\n<h2>Results</h2>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<p>I have tried a few ways of collecting usage data for the space. In late April, I tracked it manually for a week, with a total of 50 total tracked guests, possibly with some double counting of the same person on multiple days. I likely also missed some people who were here since I was not around on the weekend days or non-event evenings that week. The largest spike that week was at the EA meetup, which had 23 attendees. The largest event so far was the LessWrong 2.0 Launch Party in early April, which had at least 100 guests (for that party we co-hosted with Event Horizon upstairs and had multiple hangout spaces).</p>\n<h4>Usage Statistics Data Collection&#xA0;<br><br></h4>\n<p>I have tried multiple data collection methods (shared spreadsheet, a Google form, pen and paper). The system that has seen the most success is the pen and paper system, though it depends on how prominently the sheet is displayed upon walking into the room. The more tidy and out of the way, the less people notice it -- more people notice it when it is essentially blocking people from coming all the way in. There is clearly a tradeoff between data collection and usability of the space, so I have chosen to make it somewhat less obtrusive at the expense of data integrity. I was going to put some statistics from the pen and paper sign in sheet but I haven&#x2019;t done the data entry to analyze it yet and I want to get this post up sooner rather than later :)</p>\n<h4>Regular Meetups</h4>\n<p>Overall, EA meetups tend to get between 10 and 25 attendees depending on the topic. Game days get more attendees (closer to 40 over the course of the event) but attendance is difficult to guess from the Facebook events, even after the fact, due to many people opting for just hitting &#x201C;interested&#x201D; vs &#x201C;going&#x201D; even if they intend to go.</p>\n<p>Recurring meetups (weekly, bi-weekly, or monthly)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>EA meetup</li>\n<li>Rationalist meditation</li>\n<li>Bio-risk Meetups</li>\n<li>Game days</li>\n<li>Musical theatre karaoke</li>\n<li>Statistics study group (this since moved to a house nearer where the people live)</li>\n<li>Programming help sessions (no longer regularly occurring at REACH due to low turnout, but available upon request)</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>One-off events</h4>\n<p>Some of these have been one off events:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Rationalist Seder</li>\n<li>LessWrong 2.0 launch party</li>\n<li>Birthday parties</li>\n<li>D&amp;D sessions</li>\n<li>Bayesian Choir rehearsal (normally meets elsewhere)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There have typically been between 3 and 6 events each week, not counting coworking.</p>\n<h3>Guest rooms</h3>\n<p>The two guest rooms were occupied about 25% of the time in March (I was not making a big push for this during the setup phase), increasing to around 60% for April, and around 75 or 80% for May.</p>\n<p>I have gotten some critical feedback around the space not being very polished because of it still being a work in progress. My main thought here is that people who want a polished, nice place to stay should likely go for an AirBnB instead, but if people want a community-specific space, don&#x2019;t yet know anyone in the local Berkeley community, and are excited about getting to know people here, REACH is a good option. REACH is not the best option available for a several-month stay; REACH is better for people who want a crash pad for a few days or up to a few weeks while they get to know people and look for longer term accomodations.</p>\n<p>There has also been some awkwardness around community members not knowing how or whether to interact with overnight guests, and I hope to mitigate this by setting the expectation for visitors that they are likely to have folks try to talk to and get to know them :)</p>\n<h3>My take on the current level of success</h3>\n<p>REACH has provided a much easier path to hosting new events, caused more accessible community events to happen, and resulted in a large number of connections and conversations that would likely not have happened in the counterfactual world-without-REACH.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Coworking has been nice, especially when the group decides to do exercise pomodoros (25 minutes of work, 5 min of exercise and chatting). There are some days when the only people around are me and volunteers. The space is good for working if you&#x2019;re up for using a laptop on a couch or at a table in a large room, but not as good for things like Skype calls (there is a side room, but the internet there is often spotty) or tasks that require external monitors (there are currently 2 that are available to borrow but there isn&#x2019;t a ready-to-use setup where you can just plug in a laptop).</p>\n<p>I have been able to offer crash space to almost everyone who has requested it. I could likely be filling the rooms more fully with AirBnB (non ideal since I want to keep it community-oriented) or advertising the space more aggressively within the community (which I am arguably doing right now).</p>\n<p>There has been a fair amount of low-key spontaneous hanging out, especially on weekends. I am not sure if it has become the default place to meet up with people in the community, but there is at least a subset of the community using it that way.</p>\n<p>The goal that I&#x2019;ve had the least success with so far is having a place that is especially kid-friendly. This is largely because the space does not have good sound-isolation and is not big enough to have kid-centered activities (often loud and boisterous) at the same time as adult-centered activities (often requiring relative quiet for discussions), and right now there are significantly more adults than children in the community.</p>\n<h3>Community Feedback</h3>\n<p>Most of the feedback I&#x2019;ve received from members of the Berkeley community has been quite positive, with several members choosing to increase their pledge amounts after spending significant time in the space and finding it valuable. Many people have expressed gratitude that the space exists.</p>\n<p>If you have anything you&#x2019;d like to share about your experiences with REACH, please add it in the comments! I would prefer to keep the comments on this post mostly focused mainly on people&#x2019;s individual experiences with REACH and clarifying questions about the project. I am hosting a pre-EAG party tonight and will be volunteering at EAG this weekend so may be slow to respond to comments. If you have harsh critical feedback for me, I&#x2019;d prefer to receive it privately and have a chance to consider and address it before it is posted publicly.</p>\n<h2>Next Steps</h2>\n<h3>Issues with the Landlord</h3>\n<p>The landlord raised the rent fairly steeply this month from $4,500 to $6,000 (possibly illegally, looking into that -- I thought she wanted to raise it starting in August when she wants me to sign a year-long lease). I had a few days of panic while pulling together the funds to make the payment, but after reaching out to some community members, the shortfall was quickly made up with one-time donations. I am planning to contact the Berkeley rent board and will also be scouting potential alternative locations in case that doesn&#x2019;t work out. If anyone has experience with the rent board, or knows of potential alternate locations, please let me know! The landlady wants me to decide whether or not I will sign a new lease by July 1 (I have in fact not signed anything with her yet, as I am currently subletting).</p>\n<h3>Non-Profit Status</h3>\n<p>I have filed paperwork to turn REACH into a 501(c)(3). The papers have been submitted but I&#x2019;m still waiting on a few things before I can set up tax-deductible donations and employer matching. I don&#x2019;t know enough to have timelines on when that will become possible. If you have expertise in this domain and would be up for giving advice, I would be very grateful! Use&#xA0;<u><a href=\"mailto:theberkeleyreach@gmail.com\">theberkeleyreach@gmail.com</a></u>&#xA0;to REACH out about this.</p>\n<p>Future Funding Plans</p>\n<p>I am planning to re-apply for the next round of CEA&#x2019;s EA Grants now that we are more established. The space requires at least one person to manage it, and it&apos;s nearly impossible to recruit good candidates to work for free long term. There are plenty of people willing to *help*, but without someone coordinating and making sure that offers are followed up with concrete action, projects like this tend to falter. I am not sure if that person should continue to be me or if I should hand it off to someone else and get another tech job so that I can contribute financially instead of via labor. That said, I plan to be the person running it until it gets fully funded so that I am not asking someone to take on an unpaid job. If you know of other applicable grants that I (as a community organizer) or REACH might apply for, let me know. If you have nominations for a better person to run the day to day operations, let me know about that as well, or REACH out to one or more of the people in the appreciation section at the end of this post.</p>\n<h2>How you can be a part of it</h2>\n<h3>Use the space</h3>\n<p>Come join us for coworking or events! If it wouldn&#x2019;t be a hardship for you, pay what you can based on how much you value the events either through Patreon or one-time donations, but if money is a bottleneck for you, please don&#x2019;t worry about it. Just to prime people with some possible amounts, maybe $5 - $10 for individual events that you find valuable.</p>\n<h3>Hosting Events</h3>\n<p>The REACH calendar still has room for holding evening events (either recurring or one off). These would need to be coordinated by community members, since I am already at capacity with the recurring events that I run. For folks who are new to the space, I would prefer to oversee any large events the first time or two they host to get a sense of their logistical capabilities. After I feel comfortable with them, I would be happy to have them run events without my direct involvement (beyond ensuring the event goes on the calendar and Facebook page). To run an event, first check in with me about the idea, and if I approve the event idea, check the calendar for available dates and&#xA0;<u><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/1q6cAVmmebKvEcP4Wbx9_23XqKAkv4S1_rS3aQmR2iJI/edit\">fill out this form</a></u>&#xA0;to officially request your event. I ask for a contribution to the space for private events that require exclusive use of the main space (usually around $100, but could be more or less depending on the type of event and level of imposition on guests, as well as taking your budget into consideration), but events that are free and open to the community are free to host. If you are planning to charge attendees, talk to me about it and we&#x2019;ll work out rates.<br><br>If you have an event idea but don&#x2019;t want to host it alone, I can try to put you in touch with someone who can co-host (possibly myself). I can also provide snacks and help with catering if you are willing to reimburse me for those things. I can also help you with furniture rearrangement, speaker and projector setup, and other logistics.</p>\n<p>Tessa Alexanian, the main organizer behind the bio-risk meetups, has also offered help and advice for people wanting to start new recurring meetups (though please wait until after EA Global to contact her, since she is coordinating volunteers at the conference!).</p>\n<h3>Volunteering at REACH</h3>\n<p>As mentioned above, there is still a lot that can and should be done to improve the space. If you are interested in volunteering time and effort rather than donating and it would not be a hardship for you, please REACH out to me (no, that joke hasn&#x2019;t gotten old yet). Currently, the best way to contact me about REACH-related matters is theberkeleyreach@gmail.com</p>\n<h3>Finding out more</h3>\n<p>Check out the&#xA0;<u><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/reachberkeley/\">Facebook page</a></u>&#xA0;or the&#xA0;<u><a href=\"http://www.bayrationality.com/about-the-berkeley-reach\">REACH subsection</a></u>&#xA0;on the&#xA0;<u><a href=\"http://www.bayrationality.com/\">bayrationality</a></u>&#xA0;site if you want more info. There is also a Discord server, which I will not link here for privacy reasons, but if you want to join it send me a bit of information about yourself and why you would like to join the server at&#xA0;<u><a href=\"mailto:therberkeleyreach@gmail.com\">therberkeleyreach@gmail.com</a></u>. It is primary for people who at least occasionally use the space or have contributed to the space in some way.</p>\n<h2>I haven&#x2019;t done this alone</h2>\n<h3>Recognition and Appreciation for Individual Effort from Community Members</h3>\n<p>Several folks have helped set up and improve the space.</p>\n<p>Individuals:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Oliver Habryka helped me secure the space</li>\n<li>Oliver and Ray helped me scheme how to set it up</li>\n<li>Eric Rogstad agreed to let me sublet</li>\n<li>Kurt Brown moved upstairs earlier than expected on short notice</li>\n<li>Claire Wang helped with the logistics shuffling furniture between Event Horizon and REACH, as well as being a liaison between me and the Event Horizon residents generally</li>\n<li>Dony, Rick, and Ryan helped me with the initial cleaning spree and furniture arrangement</li>\n<li>Nate Thomas provided wise counsel, emotional support, and occasional logistical support (moving heavy items)</li>\n<li>Ratheka has helped keep the space running while I have other things on my plate (my part time job)</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Melanie Heisey, Cody Wild, Oliver Stanley, and a few others have helped with this as well</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Yulia has helped me organize and set up the space.</li>\n<li>Paul Crowley and Jessamy Barker for the donation of their SUV (Behemoth)</li>\n<li>Tessa and the rest of the bio-risk team, Yulia, Herschel, Gordon, and a few others have consistently shown up to host their recurring events, which have been a key part of getting the space up and running with regular usage.</li>\n<li>Scy Yoon for designing and painting an excellent sign for the front door, and dog-sitting</li>\n<li>Scott, Ben and Ray have promoted the space and signal-boosted the Patreon. Several others have signal boosted on Facebook.</li>\n<li>Katja Grace for organizing and hosting AI risk coworking days</li>\n<li>Andrew Rettek and Doe for agreeing to be members of the REACH non-profit board</li>\n<ul>\n<li>Andrew for helping with the paperwork/phone calls</li>\n<li>Others for being up for considering it and saying no when they realized they wouldn&#x2019;t be able to put in the time and effort to do a good job</li>\n</ul>\n<li>Nate, Tessa, and Ray for helping edit this post, and the others on this list for checking off on me using their name in a public post</li>\n<li>The 93 patrons on Patreon, and ~30 one-time donors (there is likely some overlap between those; I have not carefully looked through this data)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All of this support has been incredibly valuable. A community center cannot function without a community. The community has shown up to make this this place a real community hub.</p>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>While REACH is still a work in progress, it is getting a fair bit of usage and many of the people who frequent it seem to be getting value out of it. Perhaps we should find a cheaper venue, but there are definite advantages to the current location (near BART, walkable from many community members&#x2019; homes). I think it is important to keep it mostly free to use the space.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "sdspikes"}}, {"_id": "DsPyfxhXTi2Ph2pZf", "title": "The first AI Safety Camp & onwards", "postedAt": "2018-06-07T18:49:06.249Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><span>co-author:&#xA0;</span><a href=\"https://eahub.org/user/linda-linsefors\">Linda Linsefors</a></p>\n<h6>&#xA0;</h6>\n<h1>Summary</h1>\n<p>Last month, 5 teams of up-and-coming researchers gathered to solve concrete problems in AI alignment at our 10-day AI safety research camp in Gran Canaria.</p>\n<p><strong>This post describes</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>the event format we came up with</li>\n<li>our experience &amp; lessons learned in running it in Gran Canaria</li>\n<li>how you can contribute to the&#xA0;next camp in Prague on 4-14 October &amp; future editions</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h1>The event format</h1>\n<p><em>In <a href=\"/ea/1kd/proposal_for_the_ai_safety_research_camp/\">February</a>, we proposed our plans for the AI Safety Camp:</em></p>\n<h2>Goals:</h2>\n<p>Efficiently launch aspiring AI safety and strategy researchers into concrete productivity by creating an &#x2018;on-ramp&#x2019; for future researchers.</p>\n<p><strong>Specifically:&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>Get people started on and immersed into concrete research work intended to lead to published papers.</li>\n<li>Address the bottleneck in AI safety/strategy of few experts being available to train or organize aspiring researchers by efficiently using expert time.</li>\n<li>Create a clear path from &#x2018;interested/concerned&#x2019; to &#x2018;active researcher&#x2019;.</li>\n<li>Test a new method for bootstrapping talent-constrained research fields.</li>\n</ol>\n<p><em>Note:</em> this does not involve reaching out to or convincing outside researchers &#x2013; those who are not yet doing work in the field of AI safety &#x2013; on the imperative of solving alignment problems.&#xA0;</p>\n<h2><strong>Method:</strong></h2>\n<p>Run an online study group culminating in an intensive in-person research camp. Participants work in teams on tightly-defined research projects on the following topics:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Agent foundations</li>\n<li>Machine learning safety</li>\n<li>Policy &amp; strategy</li>\n<li>Human values</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Project ideas are proposed by participants prior to the start of the program. After that, participants split into teams around the most popular research ideas (each participant joins one team, and each team focuses on one research topic).</p>\n<h2>What the camp isn&#x2019;t about:</h2>\n<p>The AI Safety Camp is not about convincing anyone about the importance of AI alignment research. The camp is for people who are already on board with the general ideas, and who want to develop their research skills and/or find like-minded people to collaborate with. Trying to convert people from adjacent research fields is a very different project, which we do not think mixes well with this event.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The AI Safety Camp is not a summer school (unlike the <a href=\"http://humanaligned.ai/\">one coming up this August in Prague</a>). There are no teachers although teams can correspond with experienced advisors. Participants are expected to have the knowledge needed to do research together. However, it is not required for everyone to have research experience, or to know every relevant fact. That is what the team is for &#x2013; to help each other, and lift each other up.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h1>The first camp</h1>\n<h2>How it came to be:&#xA0;</h2>\n<p>The project got started when Linda Linsefors tried to figure out how to find AI safety researchers to cowork with in a supportive environment. Effective Altruism Global London (November 2017) was coming up so she decided to network there to look for a &#x201C;multiplayer solution&#x201D; to the problem &#x2013; one that would also also help others in a similar situation.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>After bouncing ideas off various people in the conference corridors, Linda had formed a vague plan of starting a research retreat &#x2013; renting a venue somewhere and inviting others to try to do research together.</p>\n<p>While joining an Open Philanthropy Project open office hour, Tom McGrath (who became our team preparation leader) overheard Linda talking about her idea and wanted to explore it further. Later, while couchsurfing at Sam Hilton&#x2019;s place, she met Remmelt Ellen (who became our meetings &amp; logistics leader) and together they created and drew attention to a <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/AISafetyCamp/\">Facebook group</a> and form where people could indicate their interest. Nandi Schoots (who became our interviews &amp; programme leader) and David Kristoffersson (who became our international connector) quickly found the Facebook group and joined our first organisers&#x2019; call.</p>\n<p>Our core organising team formed within a week, after which we scheduled regular video calls to sort out the format, what to call the event, where to organise it, and so on. We hit the ground running and coordinated well through Facebook chats and Zoom calls considering we were a bunch of international volunteers. Perhaps our team members were unusually dedicated because each of us had taken the initiative to reach out and join the group. We also deliberately made fast decisions on next actions and who would carry them out &#x2013; thus avoiding the kind of dragged-out discussions where half of the team has to sit idly by to wait for conclusions that no one acts upon.</p>\n<p>Initially, we decided to run the first camp in July 2018 in either Berlin or the UK. Then Las Palmas, Gran Canaria was suggested as an alternative in our Facebook group by Maia Pasek from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/crowsnestrationality/\">Crow&#x2019;s Nest</a> (sadly Maia passed away before the camp started). We decided to run a small pilot camp there in April to test how well the format worked &#x2013; thinking that Gran Canaria was a cheap, attractive sub-tropical island with on-the-ground collaborators to sort out the venue (this ended up being mostly Karol Kubicki).</p>\n<p>However, in February a surprising number of researchers (32) submitted applications of mostly high quality &#x2013; too many for our 12-person AirBnB apartment (a cancellable booking made by Greg Colbourn). Instead, we booked an entire hostel to run the full edition that we had originally envisaged for July, effectively shortening our planning time by 3 months.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>This forced us to be effective and focus on what was most important to make the camp happen. But we were also basically chasing the clock at every step of the organising process, which led to costly mistakes such as rushing out documents and spending insufficient time comparing available venues (we reviewed many more lessons learned in a 14-page internal document).&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Most of the original organisers were exhausted after the event finished and were not going to lead a second edition any time soon. Fortunately, some of the Gran Canaria camp participants are taking up the mantle to organise the second camp together with EA Czech Republic in Prague this October (for more on this see &#x201C;Next camps&#x201D; below).</p>\n<h2>Team formation:</h2>\n<p>Each applicant was invited for an interview call (with the help of Markus Salmela), of which we accepted 25 for the camp (of these, 4 people were unable to join the event).&#xA0;<br>From there, we invited participants to jot down their preferences for topics to work on and planned a series of calls to form research teams around the most popular topics.</p>\n<p>After forming 5 teams, we had an online preparation period of roughly 6 weeks to get up to speed on our chosen research topics (through Slack channels, calls and in-person chats). This minimised the need to study papers at the camp itself. However, it was up to each team to decide how to best spend this time &#x2013; e.g. some divided up reading materials, or wrote <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZzczZkXY7gvYHobBco6FXl0dH8K4KgWok--hEeAUgHE/edit\">research proposals</a> and got feedback from senior researchers (including Victoria Krakovna, Stuart Armstrong and Owain Evans).</p>\n<h2><strong>Event structure:</strong></h2>\n<p>The camp consisted of coworking punctuated by team support sessions and participant-organised activities.</p>\n<p><strong><span>Programme summary</span>:</strong><em><br>Day 1:</em>&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;Arrival, starting ceremony<br><em>Day 2:</em>&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;Team research<br><em>Day 3:</em>&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;Team research<br><em>Day 4:</em>&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;Research idea presentations, half day off<br><em>Day 5:</em>&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;Team debugging, research ducking in pairs, team research<br><em>Day 6:</em>&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;Inter-team hamming circles, team research, research ducking in pairs<br><em>Day 7:</em>&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;Day off<br><em>Day 8:&#xA0;</em>&#xA0; &#xA0; Team research<br><em>Day 9:</em>&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;Team research, AlphaZero presentation (participant initiative), career circle<br><em>Day 10:</em>&#xA0; Team research, research presentations, closing ceremony<br><em>Day 11:</em>&#xA0; Feedback form, departure</p>\n<p>The programme was split into three arcs (day 1-4, day 4-7, day 7-11) where the workload gradually intensified until it&#xA0;turned&#xA0;back&#xA0;down &#x2013; hopefully enabling teams to do intensive work sprints while not burning out.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The support sessions on day 5 and 6 were aimed at helping teams resolve bottlenecks and become more productive. Although a few participants mentioned they were surprisingly useful, doing them during daylight hours hindered teams from getting on with research. For future camps, we suggest having only optional Hamming circles and research ducking sessions in the evening.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Participants also shared their own initiatives on the dining room blackboard such as morning yoga, beach walks, mountain hiking, going out for dinner, a clicker game and an AlphaZero presentation. We wholeheartedly recommend fostering <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unconference\">unconference</a>-style initiatives at research events &#x2013; they give participants the freedom to make up for what you have missed.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Two experienced Centre for Applied Rationality workshop mentors, Ben Sancetta and Anne Wissemann, had the job of supporting participants in sorting out any issues they or their team encountered, and helping ensure that everyone was happy (Anne also oversaw supplies). Luckily, everyone got along so well that Anne and Ben only had a handful of one-on-ones. Nevertheless, having them around was a treat for some participants, as it allowed them to drop in and vent whatever was on their mind, knowing that it would not unduly bother either of them.</p>\n<h2><strong>Budget:</strong></h2>\n<p>The total cost of organising the camp was &#x20AC;11,572 (excluding some items paid for by the organisers themselves).&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The funds were managed through the bank account of Effective Altruism Netherlands. Unspent money was transferred to the Czech Association for Effective Altruism for the next camp (they are open to donations if their EA Grant application for the camp gets delayed or rejected).</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://image.ibb.co/fxa98T/Screen_Shot_2018_06_07_at_17_07_33.png\" alt=\"AI Safety Camp - Gran Canaria - income &amp; expenses\">&#xA0;</p>\n<h2><strong>Results:</strong></h2>\n<p>Each team has <a href=\"https://aisafetycamp.com/2018/06/05/aisc-1-research-summaries/\">written a brief summary</a> of the work they did during the camp (as well as future plans). Other outcomes include:&#xA0;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The bounded rationality team has received&#xA0;funding&#xA0;from <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NIg4OnQyhWGR01fMVTcxpz8jDd68JdDIyQb0ZZyB-go/edit?usp=drive_web&amp;ouid=116971326409968879540\">Paul Christiano</a> to continue their work.</li>\n<li>The Gridworld team has written a <a href=\"https://www.gleech.org/grids/\">blogpost</a> and are making a GitHub pull request for their work to be added to the Safety Gridworlds repository.</li>\n<li>The Safe AF team is writing a paper on their results.</li>\n<li>At least 2 participants have changed their career plans towards working on AI safety (many participants were already junior researchers or had already made up their minds prior to the camp).</li>\n<li>8 more participants reported an increase in their motivation and/or confidence in doing research work.&#xA0;&#xA0;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As our Gran Canaria &quot;pilot camp&quot; grew in ambition, we implicitly worked towards the outcomes we expected to see for the &#x201C;main camp&#x201D;:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Three or more draft papers have been written that are considered to be promising by the research community.</li>\n<li>Three or more researchers who participated in the project would obtain funding or a research role in AI safety/strategy in the year following the camp.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It is too soon to say about whether the first goal will be met, although with one paper in preparation and one team having already obtained funding it is looking plausible. The second goal was already met less than a month after the camp.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h1>Improving the format</h1>\n<p>The format of the AI Safety Camp is still under development. Here are two major points we would like to improve. Suggestions are welcome.&#xA0;</p>\n<h2><strong>1.&#xA0; &#xA0;Managing team onboarding:<br></strong></h2>\n<p>After the interviews, we accepted applicants on the condition that they would find a research team, which created uncertainty for them.</p>\n<p>Forming research teams that consist of people with a good fit for promising topics lies at the foundation of a productive camp. But it is also a complex problem with many variables and moving parts (e.g. Do we accept people first and form teams around these people, or do we form teams first and accept people based on their fit with a team? Should we choose research topics first and then decide who joins which team, or should we form teams first and then let them choose topics?).&#xA0;</p>\n<p>We handled this at the first camp by trying to do everything at the same time. Although this worked out okay, the onboarding process can be made easier to follow and smoother at future camps.</p>\n<p><em>Note:</em> The irrationality team of 5 people ended up splitting into two sub-groups since one of the topics seemed too small in scope for 5 people. We suggest limiting group size to 4 people at future camps.</p>\n<h2><strong>2.&#xA0; Integrating outside advisors:&#xA0;</strong></h2>\n<p>Many senior AI Safety researchers replied slowly to our email requests to advise our teams, presumably because of busy schedules. This led to a dilemma:&#xA0;</p>\n<p>A. If we waited until we knew what the research topics would be, then we might not have gotten an answer from potential advisors in time.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>B. If we acted before topics had been selected, we would end up contacting many senior researchers who were not specialised in the final topics.</p>\n<p>At the first camp, we lacked time for working out a clear strategy, so teams ended up having to reach out to&#xA0;advisors we found. For future camps, it should be easier to connect advisors with teams given that the next organisers are already on the move. Hopefully, experienced researchers reading this post will also be inclined to offer a few spare hours to review research proposals and draft papers (please send us a short&#xA0;<a href=\"mailto:contact@aisafetycamp.com\">email</a>).&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h1>Next camps</h1>\n<p><strong><span>The next camps will happen in</span>:<br></strong>4-14 Oct 2018: Prague, Czechia<br><em>&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;in collaboration with the <a href=\"/ea/1ls/introducing_czech_association_for_effective/\">Czechia Association for Effective Altruism</a> <br>&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;(they will also organise the <a href=\"http://humanaligned.ai/\">Human-aligned AI Summer School</a> in&#xA0;August)</em></p>\n<p>~ March 2019: Blackpool, United Kingdom<br><em>&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; at the <a href=\"/ea/1pc/ea_hotel_with_free_accommodation_and_board_for/\">EA Hotel</a> (offers free accommodation for researchers)</em></p>\n<h2>&#xA0;</h2>\n<p><strong><span>If you&#x2019;ve gotten this far, we can use your contribution</span>:<br></strong>&#x2192; <a href=\"https://goo.gl/forms/HyjnH4FjkSh0knHf2\">Apply</a> to join the Prague camp&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#x2192; <a href=\"mailto:contact@aisafetycamp.com\">Email</a> contact@aisafetycamp.com if you are&#xA0;considering</p>\n<ul>\n<li>advising research teams on their projects</li>\n<li>contributing your skills to organising camps</li>\n<li>funding future&#xA0;camps</li>\n<li>running your own edition next year<br><em>criteria: experienced organisers who will run our general format &amp; uphold a high quality standard that reflects well on the wider research community</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#x2192; <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/AISafetyCamp/\">Join</a> our Facebook group to stay informed (or check out our <a href=\"https://aisafetycamp.com/\">webpage</a>)</p>\n<p>&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<h1>Acknowledgement</h1>\n<p><strong><span>The first AI Safety Camp was made possible by the following donors</span>:<br></strong>Centre for Effective Altruism&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;&#x20AC;2,961<br>Machine Intelligence Research Institute&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;&#x20AC;3,223<br>Greg Colbourn&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;&#x20AC;3,430<br>Lotta and Claes Linsefors&#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0; &#x20AC;4,000</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "remmelt"}}, {"_id": "9ShnvD6Zprhj77zD8", "title": "Animal Equality showed that advocating for diet change works.

All code for analyses contained <a href=\"https://github.com/peterhurford/personal/blob/gh-pages/tilde/files/ianimal/analysis.R\"> is available on GitHub</a>.</em></p>\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Animal Equality and Faunalytics put together a field study testing individual video outreach on belief and diet change. They found statistically significant results on both. Together with the Reducetarian study, we now think there is sufficient evidence to establish that individual outreach may work to produce positive change for nonhuman animals. However, evidence in this study points to an estimate of $310 per pig year saved (90% interval: $46 to $1100), which is worse than human-focused interventions even from a species neutral perspective. More analysis would be needed to see how individual outreach compares to other interventions in animal advocacy or in other cause areas.</p>\n<h2><br> Introduction</h2>\n<p>Individual outreach for improving the lives of animals has <a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/research/interventions/\"> a lot of possible interventions</a>. While empirical evidence to help us understand and decide between these interventions has improved a lot over the past five years, there remain significant limitations in methodology. Previously, only the <a href=\"https://osf.io/nxrx3/\">the 2016 AWAL Newspaper Study</a> (see <a href=\"http://www.awalab.org/2016/10/12/reducetarian-messaging-study/\"> announcements from the Reducetarian Foundation</a>&#xA0;and <a href=\"http://www.awalab.org/2016/10/12/reducetarian-messaging-study/\"> from AWAL</a>) has the first statistically significant effect about individual outreach on actual meat reduction (as opposed to a proxy metric) using an actual control group with sufficient statistical power<strong>[1]</strong>.</p>\n<p>Now, a new study by Faunalytics, with cooperation from Animal Equality and Statistics Without Borders, enters the picture, purporting to find that video (in both 2D and 360-degree virtual reality) produces statistically significant diet change when compared with a control group (see&#xA0;<a href=\"https://osf.io/r4zft/\">the full report</a>, <a href=\"https://osf.io/7wh93/\">all the relevant data and code</a>, <a href=\"https://www.animalequality.net/virtualreality-study\"> Animal Equality announcement</a>, and the&#xA0;<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/video-outreach-impact-pork-consumption/\">Faunalytics announcement</a>). Does this finding hold up?</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>What is the basic methodology?</h2>\n<p>Participants were recruited across 35 different college campuses and across 86 days. Participants were placed into one of the three conditions (2D video, 3D video, or control / no video) based on a clustered RCT design, where each day each campus was randomized into a different condition for the entire campus-day. 3068 participants were initially recruited, received the treatment (or no treatment), and then filled out a questionnaire.</p>\n<p>Participants were given up to seven email reminders and six text reminders to complete the survey, so non-response could be expected to be a sign of active disinterest rather than simply not remembering about the second survey. Participants were also incentivized with being entered into a lottery with the potential for one person to earn $1000. 58% of people responded (1782 participants).</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>What are the headline results?</h2>\n<p>Respondents were either shown a 2D video about the horrors of pig farming, a 360 VR video (using <a href=\"https://ianimal360.com/\">new iAnimal technology</a>), or no video (control group). Respondents in the two treatment groups were more likely to say that factory farming contributed to pigs&#x2019; suffering and that it was important to minimize the amount of pork one consumes compared to the control group at a follow up one month later. More importantly, the treatment group reported less consumption of pork at the follow-up. However, there was no statistically significant difference between the 2D and 360 VR video conditions.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>What are the results on attitudes, more specifically?</h2>\n<p>The study does a good job of mentioning which results are statistically significant and which are not and doing analysis controlling for a majority of factors. Given that we&#x2019;re personally far more interested in whether video works as a medium rather than the difference between 2D and 360 VR video and given that the study did not find a significant effect between 2D and 360 VR, we found it much more convenient to pool the study into a single treatment and control group.</p>\n<p><br> The study itself had two key measures of attitudes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Suffering attitude:</strong> &#x201C;Eating pork (bacon, ham, pork chops, spare ribs, bacon bits, etc.) directly contributes to the suffering of pigs.&#x201D; (5-point Likert Scale, Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Consumption attitude:</strong> &#x201C;It is important to minimize the amount of pork (bacon, ham, pork chops, spare ribs, bacon bits, etc.) a person consumes.&#x201D; (5-point Likert Scale, Strongly Disagree to Strongly Agree)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Impact on Suffering Attitude</em></p>\n<p>Immediately after the video, 67.0% of the control group and 79.4% of the treatment groups agreed or strongly agreed with the fact that eating pork contributed to suffering of pigs (p &lt; 0.0001, Chi-squared test).</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Impact on Consumption Attitude</em></p>\n<p>Immediately after the video, 60.0% of the control group and 77.0% of the treatment groups agreed or strongly agreed with the fact that it is important to minimize pork eating (p &lt; 0.0001, Chi-squared test).</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Did attitudes still hold at the one month follow up?</h2>\n<p>In a word: yes. Most of those who reported believing after watching a video that eating pigs contributed to their suffering and that it is important to minimize consumption still reported believing that one month later, and vice versa.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Impact on Suffering Attitude</em></p>\n<p>At the one month follow up, 79.2% of the treatment group still agreed (compared to 79.4% on the baseline survey), while now 72.2% of the control group agreed in this statement (compared to 67.0% on the baseline survey). The difference remained statistically significant, even if it was smaller (p &lt; 0.0001, Chi-squared test). However, we suspect that this uptick in the control group is not the result of a change in beliefs, but rather a change in who had responded to the second survey.</p>\n<p>Of the 358 people in the treatment group who disagreed with the statement (remember this is after watching the video), 117 (32.7%) held their ground on the follow-up, 87 (24.3%) of them changed their mind, and 154 (43.0%) did not respond. Of the 1426 people in the treatment group who did agree, 798 (56.0%) of them still agreed, 113 (7.9%) had flipped to disagreeing, and 515 people (36.1%) did not respond.</p>\n<p>Of the 390 people in the control group who disagreed with the statement (they did not see any video), 126 (32.3%) held their ground on the follow-up, 87 (22.3%) of them changed their mind, and 154 (39.5%) did not respond. Of the 1426 people in the treatment group who did agree, 798 (56.0%) of them still agreed, 113 (7.9%) had flipped to disagreeing, and 515 people (36.1%) did not respond.</p>\n<p>Among both groups, agreement on the first survey was predictive of whether the respondent would respond on the follow-up survey (p &lt; 0.0001, Chi-squared test).</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Impact on Consumption Attitude</em></p>\n<p>At the one month follow up, 75.8% of the treatment group still agreed (compared to 77.0% on the first survey), while now 67.0% of the control group agreed in this statement (compared to 60.0% on the first survey). This is the same story as before -- the difference is smaller now, but remains statistically significant (p &lt; 0.0001, Chi-squared test), and appears to be largely driven by people dropping out between the two surveys instead of people changing their beliefs between the two surveys.</p>\n<p>Of the 400 people in the treatment group who disagreed with the statement (remember this is after watching the video), 154 (38.5%) held their ground on the follow-up, 85 (21.3%) of them changed their mind, and 161 (40.3%) did not respond. Of the 1384 people in the treatment group who did agree, 761 (55.0%) of them still agreed, 116 (8.4%) had flipped to disagreeing, and 507 people (36.6%) did not respond.</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;ll spare you the same statistics for the control group, because as you can see this is basically a repeat. Obviously the people who didn&#x2019;t answer about suffering attitude are the same people who didn&#x2019;t answer about consumption attitude, because they didn&#x2019;t answer any questions on the follow-up survey at all. However, even among those who did respond, the correlation between both attitudes is very high -- 0.457 on the baseline survey and 0.459 on the follow-up survey.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>What were the results on consumption, exactly?</h2>\n<p>But talk is cheap and what we want to see is whether talk translates into action. So let&#x2019;s look at consumption change:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Consumption change:</strong> &#x201C;Thinking about your diet over the past 30 DAYS, how often did you eat meals or snacks that contained ANY TYPE OF PORK (bacon, ham, pork chops, spare ribs, bacon bits, etc.)? NOTE: It is important that you report your food consumption as accurately as possible. Examples of meals include breakfast, lunch, dinner, etc. Also tell us about snacks between meals. Think about meals and snacks at home as well as outside the home. Please take your time and carefully consider your answer.&#x201D; (Options: Never, 1-3 times per month, 1 time per week, 2-4 times per week, 5-6 times per week, 1 or more times per day)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Before any respondents were shown any video, they are asked retrospectively for the past thirty days, so presumably it should serve as a baseline, except insofar as they might have been primed or affected by social desirability bias to modify their baseline lower (more on this later). The follow up also asks about the last 30 days, so this would be the 30 days after the treatment (or lack thereof). We can thus calculate the change in diet between the baseline survey and the follow-up survey and compare this change between treatment and control groups to help factor out some of the baseline.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Ordinal Scale Results</em></p>\n<p>The original study has this broken down by an ordinal scale. Looking at the mere difference in this scale between groups we get an average reduction of 0.144 on the scale from the control group and an average of 0.350 points from the treatment group (significant with p = 0.0004, two-sample t-test<strong>[2]</strong>).</p>\n<p><br> <em>Effect on Approximate Serving Sizes</em></p>\n<p>However, the ordinal scale is not very informative, since the steps between each point on the scale are very large&#x2026; the difference between (1) Never and (2) 1-3 times a month is ~2 times a month, while the difference between (3) 2-4 times per week and (4) 5-6 times per week is ~10 times a month. To make things more complex for a moment, we offer up a simple transformation where each part of the scale is mapped to an average amount of times per month (Never -&gt; 0, 1-3 times per month -&gt; 2 times per month, 1 time per week -&gt; 4 times per month, 2-4 times per week -&gt; 12 times per month, 5-6 times per week -&gt; 22 times per month, and 1 or more times per day -&gt; 31 times per month). With this transformation, we can now extract a more meaningful statement -- the control group reduced ~1 time per month while the treatment groups reduced ~2 times per month (p = 0.0053, two sample t-test).</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Effect on Pork Elimination</em></p>\n<p>That being said, maybe we should reduce the complexity instead of increase it. How much do we really trust these self reports to be accurate? Do you remember how much pork you ate over the past thirty days? (Or, if you&#x2019;re already vegetarian, try recalling the amount of times you ate spinach over the past thirty days.) Perhaps we can&#x2019;t trust the absolute numbers, but we can trust one simple thing -- if people don&#x2019;t eat any pork at all, they&#x2019;d surely remember that. So we make a binary value -- 0 if they don&#x2019;t eat pork at all and 1 if they report eating any amount of pork.</p>\n<p>Looking at that, we find 33.4% of the control group and 31.6% of the treatment group report not eating pork on the first survey (a baseline since it asks about the time before the treatment and was answered before watching any video). On the follow-up one month later (reflecting retrospectively over the month since the study), the control group remains about the same now 32.5% not eating pork (a change of -0.9 percentage points), but the treatment group has jumped to 36.7% (a change of 5.1 percentage points). The differences between the groups are significant on the first survey (p &lt; 0.0001, chi-squared test), significant on the follow-up survey but in the opposite direction (p &lt; 0.0001, chi-squared test), and the overall difference in differences is significant (p &lt; 0.0001, t-test). We can thus conclude that the treatment group does indeed report eating less pork than the control group, one month later.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Effect on Pork Reduction</em></p>\n<p>And perhaps we can also look at reduction as a binary variable. The comparison in total servings of 1 per month by the control group and 2 per month by the treatment group may be misleading. It would be more accurate to say that the control group had 25.4% of people reduce an average of 9.96 times per month, 54.7% of people not change their diet, and 19.8% of people increase by an average of 7.69 times per month, whereas the treatment group had 32.8% of people reduce an average of 9.36 times per month, 54.2% of people not change their diet, and 13% of people increase an average of 7.84 times per month.</p>\n<p>Comparatively, the amount of people not changing is roughly the same between both treatment and control, and the magnitude of increase and decrease being roughly the same between both treatment and control, but the treatment group having fewer increasers and more reducers. Looking just at reducers, we see 32.8% of the treatment group doing some amount of reduction (by 1 time or more) compared to 25.4% of the control group (p &lt; 0.0001, Chi-squared test).</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>But how does the differential non-response affect the consumption conclusions?</h2>\n<p>Astute readers will note that there was a significant effect of non-response on attitudes, where those who were less likely to agree with the attitudes were less likely to fill out the survey. Thus they got dropped, and the follow-up survey became overall more pig-friendly in part by selection bias. Could this mean that the difference in the treatment group is solely from pork-eating people still eating pork but not filling out the second survey?</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Differential Non-Response</em></p>\n<p>While non-response is an issue, it&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Participation_bias\"> differential non-response</a>, where the kinds of people who don&#x2019;t respond are different from the kinds of people who do respond. ...That can really bias a study. For example, if those who were the least likely to think that eating pork contributes to pig suffering were the least likely to respond to the follow-up survey, then we&#x2019;d expect some bias when assessing attitudes on the follow-up survey.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, there is a statistically significant effect going on here as well. Of the 1265 people in the treatment group who initially ate pork, 673 (53.2%) of them reported that they still ate some amount of pork, whereas 92 (7.3%) reported that they had now been 30 days pork-free. However, 500 pork-eating people in the treatment group (39.5%) did not respond. On the other hand, of the 532 people in the treatment group who already started out not eating any pork, 35 of them (6.6%) reported now eating pork, 319 (60.0%) reported staying pork-free, and 178 (33.5%) did not respond. The bottom line being that the non-response rate was much higher among those who initially ate pork. This effect is significant across both initial pork-eating status across both treatment and control (p &lt; 0.0001, chi-squared test) and across treatment vs. control (p &lt; 0.0001, chi-squared test).</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Re-looking at Pork Elimination</em></p>\n<p>So what can we do to analyze our results in light of this issue? We have the optimistic scenario, where we assume despite the above evidence that the non-response is random, and that we stick to our results as-is so far. But we also could make some assumptions about those who didn&#x2019;t respond, such that they (a) did not change at all from the baseline or (b) they all ate pork between the baseline and follow-up and were too afraid to talk about it.</p>\n<p>When we re-look at the pork vs. no pork results and assume that everyone who did not respond just didn&#x2019;t change at all, there is now only a 3.2 percentage point shift instead of a 5.1 percentage point shift, but it remains significant (p &lt; 0.0001, two sample t-test). This is encouraging and lends additional confidence to a significant effect of the treatment on reducing pork consumption.</p>\n<p>However, if we assume that everyone who did not respond switched to or kept eating pork, we lose any significant effect (p = 0.44, two sample t-test). We&#x2019;d strongly expect that this kind of shift would not have actually occurred, but it is useful for establishing a lower bound. We thus can confidently rule out hypotheses like &#x201C;the treatment has a statistically significant backfiring effect of increasing pork consumption&#x201D;.</p>\n<p>Notably, the elimination has outsized effects over reduction. Of the people in the treatment group, people eliminating pork account for 5% of the treatment population but 24.1% of the total pork reduced among the treatment group. On the flip side, elimination is not the only aspect that matters, as the majority of the reduction in pork came from people reducing rather than eliminating.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Re-looking at Approximate Serving Sizes</em></p>\n<p>When looking on a per-serving basis using our transformation described before but adding the assumption that everyone who did not respond underwent no reduction (and also no increase), we now arrive at a reduction of ~0.5 &#x201C;serving&#x201D; per person on average in the control group (down from ~1 before this adjustment) and ~1.3 per person on average in the treatment group (down from ~2 before this adjustment). The difference remains significant (p = 0.0004, two sample t-test).</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Re-looking at the Ordinal Scale</em></p>\n<p>We suppose we should also look back at the original ordinal scale -- while we think it is the least intuitive and the hardest to reason about of these three measures, it is how the question is actually asked, so it&#x2019;s an important sanity check. When we assume that everyone who didn&#x2019;t fill out the survey had no change on the ordinal scale, we see an average drop of 0.076 points on the scale among the control group (down from 0.144 among just the people in the without this adjustment) and an average drop of 0.218 points among the treatment group (down from 0.350 points) (significant with p &lt; 0.0001, two-sample t-test).</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Are there any relevant confounders?</h2>\n<p><em>Did the canopy matter?</em></p>\n<p>Much care was taken in the study analysis to look at potential confounders, and this is admirable. One particular debate was that of the canopy used to contain the study. The canopy was used to blind potential participants to the particular treatment, to prevent differential non-response. However, to keep conditions similar to how they would be in the field, a canopy with factory farming images was used, even in the control group. It is possible that this weakens the control group, since there is some exposure to negative factory farming images.</p>\n<p>However, the exposure would still be much smaller for the control group than the treatment group, so while there may be some effect here, we are not that worried about this concern. If, for example, the average time watching the video of graphic animal suffering was ~5 minutes, and the average time spent focusing on images of suffering in the control condition is more like ~30 seconds as it isn&#x2019;t a matter of directed attention or focus, there is a large difference in the amount of imagery being delivered between groups. Additionally, this can only work against the finding in this study, which would mean we are underestimating any potential effect, which makes our results even more robust.</p>\n<p>A potential pilot might help us explore the impact of canopy. While 95% of participants were shown the typical canopy with animals, 2.8% of participants were shown a blank canopy with no pictures and 2.1% of participants were not shown any canopy. Pooling the typical canopy with animal pictures vs. the other two options does show a statistically significant effect on diet change (p = 0.036), but issues of statistical power and the fact that 85% of the times the non-typical canopy was used was during the treatment group skews this.<br><br> Overall, we&#x2019;d conclude that we should not worry about the effect of the canopy when interpreting these results.<br><br></p>\n<p><em>Did spillover matter?</em></p>\n<p>While the clustered randomized design (where all participants on the same campus on the same day get the same condition) should limit the effect of spillover, the study still asked about whether people discussed the study with others. Only 3% of people said they did, so any spillover effect is likely quite small. There was no significant effect (p = 0.13), but any effect would likely have insignificant statistical power to detect at this size.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Does watching to the end matter?</em></p>\n<p>The survey asked people if they watched to the end. 12.9% fessed up to not watching the entire video. Notably, people who did not watch to the end were less likely to fill out the follow-up survey, with only 49.6% of people who did not watch all the way responding, compared to 64.5% of those who did watch all the way (p &lt; 0.0001, chi-squared test).</p>\n<p>Contrary to what we may have expected, even when we assume non-responders had no diet change, there was no effect on watching the entire video and eating less pork (p = 0.47, two sample t-test). However, people who watched the video in entirety were less likely to agree that eating pork contributed to the suffering of pigs, with 79% of those who watched to the end agreeing vs. 86% of those who did not agreeing (p &lt; 0.0001, Chi-squared test). Nearly identical effects were also obtained on the belief of minimizing pork, with 77% of those who watched to the end agreeing vs. 81% of those who did not watch to the end (p &lt; 0.0001, Chi-squared test). This would be consistent with a hypothesis that those who did not watch to the end were not disinterested, but in fact overly interested and too emotionally invested to make it through all the footage. (Or the disinterested people who didn&#x2019;t watch to the end just lied about it.)</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Did social desirability bias matter?</em></p>\n<p>A notable bias on surveys is that respondents just tell you what they think you want to hear. This is called <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_desirability_bias\"> social desirability bias</a>. It&#x2019;s possible that this bias may inflate our results. To assess this, we can use a test called <a href=\"http://faunalytics.org/social-desirability-bias/\"> the Marlowe-Crowne scale</a>&#xA0;that basically sees whether respondents will give more implausible but good sounding answers.</p>\n<p>Marlowe-Crowne score had no connection to whether people reported eating less pork (p = 0.16, ANOVA) or whether people self-reported watching the entire video (p = 0.72, ANOVA). However, those higher in the Marlowe-Crowne score were slightly more likely to report believing that eating pork contributed to the suffering of pigs (p &lt; 0.0001, ANOVA) and that it was important to minimize eating of pork (p &lt; 0.0001, ANOVA), though the effect between those with a high Marlowe-Crowne score and those with a low Marlowe-Crowne score is less than one percentage point.</p>\n<p>Another area social desirability bias may affect is whether people respond to the follow-up survey. Participants received as many as seven emails and six text message reminders sent over three weeks to get responses to the follow-up survey. This could lead to effects where those who didn&#x2019;t respond initially could have been more likely to feel socially pressured if they did respond. In general, there could be differences in response between those who immediately responded and those that did not, particularly among baseline heavy pork-eaters. However, the connection between social desirability and answering the follow-up survey is not significant (p = 0.1939, ANOVA).</p>\n<p>Overall, in so far as we can assess social desirability bias, we&#x2019;d say it is not a huge factor in this study, but we&#x2019;d still generally keep it in mind and watch out for it, as self-reported data about beliefs and diet change may be inherently suspect.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Did west coast vs. east coast matter?</em></p>\n<p>The study tracked which coast they were recruiting from to see if there were any cultural differences. No statistically significant effect was obtained (p = 0.31, two sample t-test).</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Did the age of the participant matter?</em></p>\n<p>There was no effect by age on consumption (p = 0.31, ANOVA), but there were quite small yet statistically significant effects where older people were slightly more likely to believe that eating pork contributed to pig suffering (p &lt; 0.0001, ANOVA) and that it is important to minimize the amount of pork one eats (p &lt; 0.0001, ANOVA).</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Did the gender of the participant matter?</em></p>\n<p>As one would predict, men ate more pork (9 times per month on average) than other genders (6 times per month when pooled) on the baseline (p &lt; 0.0001, two sample t-test) and this continued to be true after the 30 day follow-up with 6.7 times per month on average for men and 4.0 times per average for other genders (p &lt; 0.0001, two sample t-test). However, there was no statistically significant difference in how much men reduced their meat intake in response to the treatment (p = 0.92, two sample t-test) or overall (p = 0.41, two sample t-test).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, men were much less likely to endorse pro-pig beliefs, with 70% of men in the treatment group agreeing that it is important to minimize the amount of pork one eats compared to 83.2% of other genders (pooled) (p &lt; 0.0001, two sample t-test) and 73.2% of men in the treatment group agreeing that eating pork contributes to the suffering of pigs compared to 84.9% of other genders (pooled) (p &lt; 0.0001, two sample t-test).</p>\n<p>The story is similar in the control group too, with 49% of men in the treatment group agreeing that it is important to minimize the amount of pork one eats compared to 69.2% of other genders (pooled) (p &lt; 0.0001, two sample t-test) and 57.6% of men in the treatment group agreeing that eating pork contributes to the suffering of pigs compared to 74.8% of other genders (pooled) (p &lt; 0.0001, two sample t-test).</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Does it matter that the population is overall so vegetarian to begin with?</em></p>\n<p>Notably, ~29.5% of the sample already did not eat pork throughout the entire past month at the baseline study. Relative to what would be expected of the general American public, this seems high. However, as the authors point out, &#x201C;the representation of veg*ns in Animal Equality&#x2019;s usual outreach is also unknown&#x201D; ( <a href=\"https://osf.io/r4zft/\">Faunalytics Study Report</a>, pg 28). We don&#x2019;t know whether this is cause for concern or just typical of Animal Equality&#x2019;s outreach.</p>\n<p>There&#x2019;s also an additional concern that these same trends may extend beyond those who ate no pork at all, to any who were attracted enough initially to complete the study. If the groups approached already heavily skew toward selecting for zero-pork eaters relative to the general population, it may also have heavily selected for people more susceptible to persuasion on the topic of meat-consumption. Again, this could help with generalizability to Animal Equality&#x2019;s specific outreach but decrease the generalizability outside this domain. Moreover, given the scale of the study on each campus, it&#x2019;s possible those most sympathetic in general to the study participated and there could be declining utility outside of such a target group.</p>\n<p>Similarly there is some consideration of how those who rarely or never eat pork may bias the results downward and are not necessarily the primary targets of this type of intervention:</p>\n<p><em>&#x201C;Figure 15 shows that the videos more frequently produced a decrease in pork consumption among high baseline consumers than low baseline consumers. This difference should not be surprising, in that those who rarely or never eat pork have little or no room to decrease their consumption further. This graph confirms that people who already consume little or no pork are, almost by definition, not the ideal target for this intervention.&#x201D;</em> - from <a href=\"https://osf.io/r4zft/\">the Faunalytics Study Report</a>, pg 25</p>\n<p>In the case of pork consumers who eat more than more than zero pork but less than average consumption among pork eaters, this could cut the other direction. People who already only consume a little pork could be more likely to cut it out since they may have already been more accepting of animal welfare considerations and have a smaller stake in sticking with current behaviors. On the other hand, these people have less room to decrease and obviously those already not eating pork can&#x2019;t decrease at all! Without particular evidence to suggest otherwise, one might expect frequent pork consumers to rationalize their consumption when confronted with graphic footage suggesting direct harms.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>What is the cost-effectiveness?&#xA0;</h2>\n<p>While it&#x2019;s nice to know that these videos have a statistically significant effect on pork reduction, it doesn&#x2019;t really matter unless the effect size is large enough that enough pork is reduced per dollar spent on the videos. We thus need to look at cost-effectiveness based on the amount of pigs spared per dollar spent.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>How much pork is not eaten?</em></p>\n<p>Figuring out the amount of pork not eaten due to the treatment is moderately straightforward as a result of the study. To do this, we can get the effect size of reduction of servings, convert from servings averted to actual amount of pig suffering averted, and then backtrack with the cost to run a video and get a cost-effectiveness estimate (in $USD per pig year averted) for running video.</p>\n<p>The t-test for approximate serving size can give us a 95% confidence interval for the true difference in the treatment and control group. The initial analysis finds a range of 0.31 to 1.78 additional servings reduced by the treatment group, relative to the control group. After adjusting for non-response on the assumption that non-responders have no change, the new 95% interval is 0.33 to 1.16 additional servings reduced by the treatment group, relative to the control group. Given that the second interval is fully contained within the first interval and that there&#x2019;s enough uncertainty about this, we can just go with the first interval.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>How long will the effects last?</em></p>\n<p>But how long will this effect last? We essentially want to translate the difference in pork eaten after one month to the lifetime difference among people in the control group. Animal Charity Evaluators <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/research/dietary-impacts/vegetarian-recidivism/#report\"> does a meta-analysis of two studies on vegetarian recidivism</a>&#xA0;and finds that the mean length of a vegetarianism period is 2.4 to 6.5 years.</p>\n<p>Does that mean the effects of this study will last, as-is, for 2.4 to 6.5 years, on average? Maybe. It&#x2019;s possible that the people in the study populations analyzed by ACE had a deeper conviction toward vegetarianism, on average, but it&#x2019;s also possible that they don&#x2019;t. Simply eating less pork is a much smaller commitment and easier to sustain, however it may be a much less strongly held conviction or it may not even be a consciously noticed choice at all. Thus while it is more sustainable, we don&#x2019;t know if it more likely to actually be sustained.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s also possible that the typical vegetarianism period is the result of far more factors than just a video, and thus it would be unfair to assign the entire period to the video as we do here. On the other hand, it does feel a lot more plausible that maintaining pork reduction is a lot easier than maintaining vegetarianism. After all, <a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/a-summary-of-faunalytics-study-of-current-and-former-vegetarians-and-vegans/\"> Faunalytics found</a>&#xA0;that lapsed vegetarians still ate less meat than people who were never vegetarian.</p>\n<p>Taking all this together, we arbitrarily extend the range to assume a 90% confidence interval that the pork reduction observed in the study will last for a total of 1 to 12 years<strong>[3]</strong>. We can then calculate the lifetime reduction of pork by multiplying this value and the amount of pork reduction per month. When we do so, we calculate that people in the treatment group will eat pork 58 fewer times than people in the control group (90% interval: 14 to 180).</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>How much pig is not eaten?</em></p>\n<p>But how many pigs are saved when people eat pork 58 times less? Well, if we assume that each time someone eats pork they are <a href=\"https://fns-prod.azureedge.net/sites/default/files/fgp_sizes.pdf\"> eating 2 to 6 ounces of it </a> and that <a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/how-much-direct-suffering-is-caused-by-various-animal-foods/\"> a typical pig produces 200-230 pounds of meat </a> , that means the typical person eating pork 58 less times will be eating one sixteenth less of a pig in their life (90% interval: 0.013 to 0.21).</p>\n<p>Lastly, we need to adjust for product elasticity -- the amount that the supply of pork will fall when demand for pork falls. A reduction of pork consumption reduces demand, but the effect on supply is not 1-to-1. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iNDQIt9MRD4r1ws5M_2hQ-MNjMY-bcUra0fpOmF4Am0/edit#gid=0\"> Research by Animal Charity Evaluators into product elasticity </a> finds that reducing demand for pigs by 1 pig will cause a corresponding decline in pigs supplied of 0.57 (90% interval: 0.42 to 0.87). Thus the reduction in demand of one sixteenth of a pig corresponds to sparing 0.03 pigs (90% interval: 0.0075 to 0.13).</p>\n<p>Given that a typical pig lives about six months, each person in the treatment group is thus sparing ~1 week of pig suffering (90% interval: 1.3 days to 23.7 days).</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>What are the costs?</em></p>\n<p>So we know the benefits&#x2026; now we need to know the costs. This study did not use the common &#x201C;pay per view model&#x201D; where people are incentivized to watch the video with a nominal cash prize (typically $1), so that means the costs really are just staff pay of setting up and running the booth, plus the fixed costs of buying all the equipment amortized over each individual. If we&#x2019;re being truly scrupulous, we may be inclined to include opportunity costs of the staff and volunteers as well.</p>\n<p>It appears that for each tour group, there were 1-2 staff members and 2-3 volunteers. Also, the 2D video involved 8 tablets per tour and the 360 VR video involved 6 VR headsets per tour. While this study reached ~36 people per day, Che Green at Faunalytics says that when not encumbered by running a study, Animal Equality is typically able to reach 70-100 people a day, though the number can have a high degree of variation, going as low as 7 and as high as 219. Assuming outreach is run ~200 days a year (my guess) and the reach is somewhere between 50-130 people, that would be 10K-20K people reached per year by each tour team.</p>\n<p>Assuming equipment costs of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/a/best-vr-headset-oculus-rift-samsung-gear-htc-vive-virtual-reality\"> ~$600 per VR headset</a>&#xA0;and <a href=\"https://www.laptopmag.com/articles/tablet-buying-guide\"> $150 per tablet</a>&#xA0;and assuming they last for about five years, each VR headset costs $0.60 per day used and each tablet costs $0.082 per day used. With 6 headsets used per day and reaching ~70 people per day, that works out to $0.051 per person reached in headset costs. With 8 tablets per day and reaching ~70 people per day, that works out to $0.009 per person reached in tablet costs. Assuming staff pay of $150 per day ($30K/yr over 200 days), that works out to $2.14 per person reached in staff costs -- equipment costs are negligible in comparison. Thus the costs to reach a person with 2D video is ~$2.15, whereas the costs to reach a person with 360 VR video is ~$2.19.</p>\n<p><br> <em>So what&#x2019;s the cost-effectiveness?</em></p>\n<p>Given that a person can be reached for ~$2 and that they spare ~1 pig week, that works out to $150 per pig saved (90% interval: $23 to $560) and, again assuming that each pig has a ~6 month lifespan, that works out to $310 per pig year saved (90% interval: $47 to $1100). To put this in context, Against Malaria Foundation can avert a year of human suffering from malaria for $39<strong>[4]</strong>, this does not look very cost-effective.</p>\n<p>This is all summarized <a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/10871\"> in this Guesstimate model</a>.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>But what if it were chicken?</em></p>\n<p>A key part undermining the cost-effectiveness is that each pig produces so much pork. If we re-run the numbers assuming that the study was talking about chicken instead of pork and had the same results, but adjusted all the other numbers to be about chicken, we get $5.70 per chicken spared (90% interval: $0.71 to $32) and $50 per chicken year (90% interval: 6.3 to 280). This is better, but presumably still not as good as helping humans (even from a complete species-neutral point of view). This is summarized <a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/10897\"> in this additional Guesstimate model</a>.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>How does this compare to the Reducetarian study?</em></p>\n<p>Previously, <a href=\"/ea/14g/thoughts_on_the_reducetarian_labs_mturk_study/\"> one of us analyzed the Reducetarian study</a>, which as far as we know is the only other sufficiently high-powered study with a sufficient control group, adequate methodology, and a focus on a diet-related outcome. In that study, participants were recruited via Amazon&#x2019;s Mechanical Turk and in the treatment groups, on average, changed their diet to eat 0.8 less servings of turkey, pork, chicken, fish, and beef per week than those in the control group, or 3.2 total servings per month.</p>\n<p>This is more than 3x the size of the effect found here in the Animal Equality study, but it was notably across all kinds of animals and not just pork. An analysis of the data from the Reducetarian study on just pork in particular finds a reduction of 0.241 servings among the treatment groups (pooled) and an increase of 0.104 servings among the control group (p = 0.009, two sample t-test). The 95% confidence interval is that the difference lies between 0.087 and 0.605 servings reduced by the treatment group after controlling for the effect on the control group, which is actually 2x less than what is found in the Animal Equality study. Thus the Animal Equality videos may be twice as effective (at least for pork) though twice as expensive to run.</p>\n<p>We don&#x2019;t really know what would happen if we were to extrapolate the results of the Animal Equality study to diet changes on all animals. It makes sense that the effect on pork would be higher than usual given that the treatment specifically focused on pigs. It is certainly possible that this effect would produce broader effects on reducing meat generally. However, it is also possible that there is a substitution effect where people eat less pork but start eating more chicken instead in a way that might actually be net negative. While some initial analysis like the Reducetarian study and <a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Faunalytics-Study-of-Current-and-Former-Vegetarians-and-Vegans-%E2%80%93-Secondary-Findings-.pdf\"> Faunalytics&#x2019;s study of vegetarians</a>&#xA0;do not find a substitution effect when they could, we still don&#x2019;t yet have enough evidence to rule this out.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>How does this compare to ACE&#x2019;s assessment of Animal Equality?</em></p>\n<p>Animal Charity Evaluators produced <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/animal-equality/#comprehensive-review\"> a comprehensive review of Animal Equality</a>, including <a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/9590?token=sSMogCCGAhX_PxpHvvOxEp_lP376AAmzJ3YL2XKYMqebUal1E8zL86vNw7-ZQRcPFKDkKAaATiN3g9CDuj5XVA\"> this Guesstimate estimate</a>. ACE used leafleting as their baseline for understanding the impact on animals, where each leaflet is taken to reduce ~4 farmed animal days on average (90% interval: -255.5 days to 324.85 days) (see cell SCI3 in the top right of the Guesstimate).</p>\n<p>However, it is assumed by ACE that 2D video would be ~3x as impactful as leafleting (90% interval: 1x to 8.7x), which magnifies the effect to ~58 days (90% interval: -620.5 days to 1971 days) for 2D video. Furthermore, 360 VR video is assumed to be ~6x as impactful as leafleting (90% interval: 2.1x to 14x), which magnifies the effect to ~40 days (90% interval: -1314 days to 2591.5 days)<strong>[5]</strong>. With a cost per person reached of ~$2.20 (90% interval: $1.90 to $2.60), that would work out to $500 per animal year saved from 2D video and $350 per animal year saved from 360 VR video.</p>\n<p>While based on the results in this study, we think we can reject the hypothesis that 360 VR video is twice as effective per person as 2D video<strong>[6]</strong>, it is notable that this calculation is not too different from what we established above.</p>\n<h2><br> <br>What did this study not find?</h2>\n<p>Notably, this study did not look at any effects other than pork, which could be problematic as it needlessly constrains the cost-effectiveness estimate to focus on the relatively expensive to help pigs compared to other animals, or even all animals as a whole. As the Reducetarian study found, broad reduction across all possible animal consumption would outweigh in effectiveness a reduction of consumption in any one animal.<br><br> On the other hand, there still is an open question, as <a href=\"https://osf.io/g27xv/\"> the Faunalytics design document for this study notes </a> , about how to handle the fact that self-reporting your diet across a ton of different animals is really hard. Certainly focusing on just pork does simplify things. More research on how people interact with these food frequency questionnaires and what questions to ask may be merited.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>How should we cautiously interpret these results?</h2>\n<p>It&#x2019;s great to see a robust study of any sort that looks at diet change with sufficient statistical power from a large sample and that gets statistically significant effects that are robust from cutting the data under different approaches (e.g., binary elimination, converting to serving sizes, etc.) and almost entirely robust after correcting for multiple hypothesis testing[7]. The fact that this study took place in the field with reasonably close conditions to what would obtain in reality, as opposed to being in Mechanical Turk, is all the more encouraging. At this point, we&#x2019;d be willing to believe now that there is a substantial chance that at least some forms of individual animal advocacy work.</p>\n<p>However, by &#x201C;they work&#x201D;, we mean that they produce net positive results. Whether they are genuinely cost-effective compared to our alternatives is still something that remains to be established, and this study establishes a discouraging initial cost-effectiveness estimate. It&#x2019;s possible that some elements of the study design (such as the canopy or the survey itself) may have reduced the true effect of Animal Equality&#x2019;s program. It&#x2019;s also possible that looking at diet changes more expansively may produce more encouraging results. Perhaps it would be a good idea to replicate this study, but look more at all kinds of diet change to try to see if we can get evidence that establishes a better cost-effectiveness estimate.</p>\n<p>It is still too early to say we should reconsider individual outreach. For one, it is hard to compare video to other individual outreach strategies -- or even non-outreach strategies for that matter -- given the lack of robust cost-effectiveness estimates for other areas. Also, it is possible that individual outreach may have important medium term effects and/or fit into a broader holistic strategy.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to Jo Anderson, Che Green, and David Moss for reviewing this piece.</em></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Endnotes</h2>\n<p><strong>[1]:</strong> Other prior work is plentiful, but had either an insufficiently large sample size to find significant effects (e.g., <a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/research/interventions/humane-education/humane-education-study-fall-2013/\"> ACE 2013 Humane Education Study</a>;<a href=\"/ea/y2/more_thoughts_and_analysis_on_the_mercy_for/\">MFA 2016 Online Ads Study</a>), had an insufficient control group size (e.g., <a href=\"http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/a-re-analysis-of-ace-leaflet-study/\"> ACE 2013 Leafleting Study</a>;<a href=\"https://ds.lclark.edu/sge/wp-content/uploads/sites/121/2014/05/Broughton-Thesis-Final-PDF.pdf\">2014 FARM Pay-per-view Study</a>;<a href=\"http://veganoutreach.org/les-fall-2016/\">VO 2015 Leafleting Study</a>; <a href=\"https://repository.asu.edu/attachments/158042/content/Fehrenbach_asu_0010E_15253.pdf\"> Ferenbach, 2015</a>; <a href=\"https://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/92865/HENNESSY-THESIS-2016.pdf\"> Hennessy, 2016</a>), had no control group (e.g., <a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/FacebookAdsSurveyResults2011.pdf\"> THL 2011 Online Ads Study</a>; <a href=\"https://ccc.farmsanctuary.org/the-powerful-impact-of-college-leafleting/\"> THL 2012 Leafleting Study</a>; <a href=\"http://www.humaneleaguelabs.org/blog/2014-05-20-what-elements-make-vegetarian-leaflet-more-effective/\"> THL 2014 Leafleting Study</a>; <a href=\"http://www.humaneleaguelabs.org/blog/2015-09-20-which-request-creates-most-diet-change/\"> THL 2015 Leafleting Study</a>; <a href=\"http://veganoutreach.org/les-fall-2016/\"> VO 2015 Pay-per-view Study</a>; <a href=\"https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/66737/1/MPRA_paper_66737.pdf\"> James, 2015</a>; <a href=\"https://veganuary.com/blog/many-animals-veganuary-save/\"> Veganuary, 2015</a>; <a href=\"https://veganuary.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Veganuary-2016-Research-Results-Lives-Spared-Addendum.pdf\"> Veganuary, 2016</a>; <a href=\"https://veganuary.com/blog/did-veganuary-2017-help-animals/\"> Veganuary, 2017</a>; <a href=\"https://osf.io/b3xzs/\">Mensink, 2017</a>), only measured intent to change diet rather than actual self-reported diet change (e.g., <a href=\"http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/156853009x418073\"> Arbour, Signal, &amp; Taylor, 2009</a>; <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Lucy_Asher/publication/215570388_Measuring_the_success_of_a_farm_animal_welfare_education_event/links/0912f50ca8bd8ed5f1000000.pdf\"> Jamieson, et. al, 2012</a>; <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10643-012-0520-2\"> Rule &amp; Zhbanova, 2012</a>; <a href=\"http://www.mercyforanimals.org/welfare-reforms-survey\"> MFA 2016 MTurk Study</a>; <a href=\"/ea/xb/mfa_ad_study_targeting_former_vegetarians/\"> 2016 Retargeting Online Ad Study</a>), or did not attempt to measure differences against a baseline prior to the intervention (e.g., <a href=\"http://veganoutreach.org/pay-per-read-study-results/\"> VO 2014 Leafleting Study</a>; <a href=\"https://www.exploreveg.org/files/2015/12/StatcomReport-TCVegFest2014.pdf\"> CAA 2015 VegFest Study</a>;<a href=\"http://veganoutreach.org/ppr-2016/\"> VO 2016 Leafleting Study</a>; <a href=\"http://krex.k-state.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/2097/32159/ChelseaSchnabelrauchArndt2016.pdf\"> Ardnt, 2016</a>). This is a list of all the relevant individual veg outreach research we know of, if you can name any more, we&#x2019;d be happy to add them to this literature overview.</p>\n<p><strong>[2]:</strong> We chose simpler (and arguably less correct) statistical tests than the ones used by Faunalytics as we wanted to see whether the effects still prevailed under them and because they were easier to reason about.</p>\n<p><strong>[3]:</strong> This effect is modeled as a linear extrapolation where the effect remains constant for an amount of time and then immediately drops to 0. This of course is unrealistic, but this is not a concern as it is mathematically equivalent to a declining curve of effect that is longer in duration.</p>\n<p><strong>[4]:</strong> GiveWell has pretty thoroughly vetted the Against Malaria Foundation and found it to create the equivalent value of saving the life of a child under 5 for $764 to $3057 (average $2087) (<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models\">GiveWell, 2018</a>). While GiveWell would not want us crudely converting this figure to DALYs, we need to do so to have a remotely comparable analysis, so we consider saving the life of a child under 5 to allow them to live to the typical life expectancy of SSA &#x2013; <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN?locations=ZG\"> 59 years total</a>, or an additional 53 years &#x2013; at full health, which would be 53 DALYs averted. Thus, AMF would be at ~$15 - $58 per DALY averted (average $39).</p>\n<p><strong>[5]:</strong> It is strange that this leads to us concluding that the 2D video is more effective than the 360 VR video, despite ACE explicitly giving the 360 VR video a higher multiplier. This is due to the fact that ACE estimates also include a substantial chance of negative effect and that this is also magnified by the multiplier.</p>\n<p><strong>[6]:</strong> Of course, Animal Equality argues that while their 360 VR video may have lower short-term cost-effectiveness due to higher cost and no statistically significant increase in conversion rate, it makes up for this by being novel, thus drawing in larger crowds and being more likely to draw in people who may be more influential. This additional hypothesis is plausible but untested. Notably, staffing costs dominate the costs of equipment in the model, so running 360 VR may not be that much additional expense per person recruited, so it may not matter too much.</p>\n<p><strong>[7]:</strong> Given that 38 statistical tests were conducted, following the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_discovery_rate#Benjamini%E2%80%93Hochberg_procedure\"> Benjamini-Hotchberg procedure</a>, we ideally should reject p-values above 0.0013. The only statistically significant effect in this data with a p-value above that threshold is the difference between the amount of servings reduced between the control group and the treatment group (p = 0.0053, two sample t-test). However, this procedure for multiple hypothesis testing is very stringent.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Peter_Hurford"}}, {"_id": "MDxaD688pATMnjwmB", "title": "To Grow a Healthy Movement, Pick the Low-Hanging Fruit", "postedAt": "2018-06-06T21:41:18.306Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><em>This post is co-authored by Nick Fitz and Ari Kagan and is cross-posted from <a href=\"https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/blog/id/1433/to-grow-a-healthy-movement-go-for-low-hanging-fruit\">The Life You Can Save&apos;s blog</a>.</em></p>\n<p>We&#x2019;ve all met people who will never be open to the ideas of effective altruism (EA) no matter the framing: your neighbor who thinks that doing good is purely a matter of personal preference or your uncle who argues it&#x2019;s wrong to compare charities because they&#x2019;re all doing good. Despite hours of discussion, no real progress is made. We&#x2019;ve all also had the opposite experience: your friend who&#x2019;s on board a minute into the conversation; the one who was excited to learn that others thought the same way that she already did. You were likely such a person yourself &#x2013; you merely needed to learn of the movement to become a supporter.</p>\n<p>Much of the debate about how to build the EA movement is focused on how to frame issues to convince people of the merits of the general EA worldview. Should we talk of giving as an opportunity or an obligation? Should we emphasize global health and poverty over artificial intelligence and animal ethics? Such discussions are vital, but crafting our message can only get us so far. Many potentially highly-engaged effective altruists (EAs) haven&#x2019;t even heard of EA yet. If we knew who these folks were, we could grow the movement far more quickly and sustainably. It&#x2019;s far more effective to prioritize identifying people who are already highly predisposed towards the tenets of effective altruism than it is to struggle with those who are a much harder &#x201C;sell.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>In the &#x201D;<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/how-valuable-is-movement-growth-owen-cotton-barratt/\">Awareness/Inclination</a>&#x201D; model developed by the Centre for Effective Altruism (CEA), Cotton-Barratt proposes that movement-building is made up of two elements: making people more aware of EA ideas and making people more inclined towards EA ideas. <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/models-of-community-building/#fn1\">CEA notes</a> that it&#x2019;s much harder to increase inclination than awareness: &#x201C;Our current way of resolving this is to focus our efforts on increasing the awareness of those who already have relatively high inclination.&#x201D; This isn&#x2019;t to say that we should be closed to people radically changing their beliefs (quite the opposite), but let&#x2019;s prioritize the low-hanging fruit.</p>\n<p>To do so, we need to find people who are highly inclined towards EA, yet currently unaware of EA ideas. Indeed, a forthcoming agenda from The Life You Can Save explicitly aims to target &#x201C;demographics that are likely to be receptive to effective giving concepts relative to the general population.&#x201D; We&#x2019;ve all come to assume it&#x2019;s the white, atheist, male, developer in the bay who listens to <a href=\"https://samharris.org/podcast/\">Sam Harris</a> and reads <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/\">Less Wrong</a>. Perhaps for good reason: the <a href=\"/ea/1e1/ea_survey_2017_series_community_demographics/\">2017 EA survey</a> found that the current movement is 89% white, 81% atheist, 81% ages 20-35, and 70% male. But are these numbers representative of those receptive to effective altruism? Or do they simply reveal how EA has historically spread through homophilic social networks, software engineering teams, and elite universities.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<h1>The study</h1>\n<p>In a recent study, we&#x2019;ve explored these questions to identify who may already be receptive to EA. We ran an online study with 530 Americans to determine what predicts support for EA. After participants read a general description of EA, they completed measures of their support for EA (e.g., attitudes and giving behaviors). Finally, participants answered a collection of questions measuring their beliefs, values, behaviors, demographic traits, and more.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The results suggest that the EA movement may be missing a much wider population of highly-engaged supporters. For example, not only were women more altruistic in general (a widely replicated finding), but they were also more supportive of EA specifically (even when controlling for generosity). And whites, atheists, and young people were no more likely to support EA than average. If anything, being black or Christian indicated a higher likelihood of supporting EA. Moreover, the typical stereotype of the &#x201C;EA personality&#x201D; may be somewhat misguided. Many people - both within and outside the community - view EAs as cold, calculating types who use rationality to override their emotions&#x2014;the sort of people who can easily ignore the beggar on the street. Yet the data suggest that the more empathetic someone is (in both cognition and affect), the more likely they are to support EA. Importantly, another key predictor was the psychological trait of &#x2018;maximizing tendency,&#x2019; a desire to optimize for the best option when making decisions (rather than settle for something good enough). That is, it&#x2019;s not enough to just care about others, or to only have a tendency to optimize. When a person scores high on both empathy and maximizing, they&#x2019;re much more likely to endorse EA. We set out to increase the return on investment of movement-building work; in doing so, we discovered an underexplored, much more diverse group interested in EA, and found that the EA personality may be somewhat misunderstood. For more on these results, see <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/9ywputy5v0qzu3t/Understanding%20Effective%20Givers.pdf?dl=0\">this brief summary</a>.</p>\n<h1>Is movement building the right approach?</h1>\n<p>Most agree that the movement needs more highly committed supporters, but the questions is how to acquire them. There are concerns that movement building may lead to &#x201C;<a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/ceas-current-thinking/#preserving-value\">movement dilution</a>,&#x201D; the worry &#x201C;that an overly simplistic version of EA, or a less aligned group of individuals, could come to dominate the community, limiting our ability to focus on the most important problems.&#x201D; To avoid this problem, some suggest that we should instead focus on increasing the commitment of existing EAs. While neither focus precludes the other, traditional movement building approaches may have thus far primarily attracted low-alignment supporters, making it less valuable. Spreading ideas through the mass media is a <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/blog/the-fidelity-model-of-spreading-ideas/\">low fidelity</a> way to communicate, and framing EA to better convince people may only persuade those who aren&#x2019;t closely aligned. The approach we advocate for here sidesteps these worries: evidence-based movement-building can help us identify highly-aligned supporters. The minimal effort required to increase the awareness of someone who is already highly-inclined may immediately result in a high level of contribution to the movement. The full discussion is outside the scope of this post, but this trade-off merits more evaluation.</p>\n<h1>Where do we go from here?</h1>\n<p>This work is just the tip of the iceberg, and there&#x2019;s much more to sort out. Not enough work has been done to craft evidence-based models of sustainable movement-building. Some organizations are starting to build these tools: Students for High-Impact Charity (SHIC) <a href=\"/ea/1gb/revised_shic_impact_approach/\">has started</a> to &#x201C;collect a variety of metrics to find students most inclined to engage with effective charity in the long-term&#x201D; and the Giving Game Project is also collecting survey data toward a similar end. Once we have enough data on key traits predicting openness to the ideas of EA, we should work to find groups of people that are high in these traits and focus our efforts where there will be greater return. We&#x2019;d love for this to snowball in the community as the EA movement incorporates data-driven decision-making more generally.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>If the EA movement better understands who may already be interested in what it has to say, then it will be able to grow sustainably at a much faster rate. This may seem obvious, but it is not the current approach. This could change not only who we try to engage with effective altruism, but how we hire people, how we run fundraising campaigns, and more. It&#x2019;s time to understand who tends to support effective altruism, and why. By embracing evidence-based approaches to building the evidence-based altruism movement, we can do even more good with our resources.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>If you&apos;re interested in learning more about the study, we welcome emails at arinkagan@gmail.com and fitznich@gmail.com.&#xA0;</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "arikagan"}}, {"_id": "6YBypGG2iC7Xcctzi", "title": "Lessons for estimating cost-effectiveness (of vaccines) more effectively", "postedAt": "2018-06-06T03:18:22.906Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><span>This essay was jointly written by Peter Hurford and Marcus A. Davis.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Summary:</span><span> We investigated the cost-effectiveness of vaccine research and development to learn about how cost-effectiveness estimates are made and where they might go wrong. By doing this, we became far more wary of taking these estimates literally. Many people will do things like reducing their cost-effectiveness estimate by a factor of 10x and call this a conservative estimate, but in light of this exercise and other examples, this is not enough. Furthermore, our research underscored that donating to the Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) may be a really hard baseline to beat and that it is important to do some degree of investigation before assuming things beat AMF. Lastly, our research has some implications for biosecurity that merit further exploration.</span><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Introduction</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>We set out to figure out </span><a href=\"/ea/1o6/what_is_the_costeffectiveness_of_researching/\"><span>how cost-effective it would be to create a new vaccine</span></a><span>. After a lot of work, we came to a reasonable conclusion. The next question after doing all this is ...why?</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>We certainly don&#x2019;t plan to manufacture our own vaccine anytime soon and weren&#x2019;t thinking of funding others who might. This might puzzle people as to why we did all this research. The reason: it was a good sandbox to get our start in. We were hoping to learn more about cost-effectiveness estimation in a domain where the answer was not known but the data and sources were relatively plentiful and it was easy to compare to other academic work. If we can&#x2019;t create meaningful cost-effectiveness estimates for vaccine research and development, what kind of cost-effectiveness estimates might we be able to make?</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Lesson #1: The chance of error is substantial and all estimates should be suspect!</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>One of the major lessons we take away from this is in a historical analysis, even when the underlying issue is well documented, model uncertainty can be very high. </span><span>Many people will do things like reducing their cost-effectiveness estimate by a factor of 10x and call this a conservative estimate, but this is not enough. </span><span>Throughout our time working on vaccine cost-effectiveness, we would regularly see our estimate change by a factor of 6x because we misplaced a parenthetical, then see our estimate change by a factor of 20x (!!!) in the other direction because we forgot a crucial consideration.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Additionally, these assumptions really matter -- while our 90% confidence interval only varied by one order of magnitude, additional changes in fundamental underlying assumptions could very well have change the endline estimate by another two orders of magnitude in either direction. If we were working in a less established domain, we would not be surprised to find our estimate being off by many orders of magnitude.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>And it&#x2019;s not just novices like us that are likely to make sizable errors like this:<br></span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>The DCP2 estimates of deworming, done by multiple well credentialed economists, <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2011/09/29/errors-in-dcp2-cost-effectiveness-estimate-for-deworming/\"><span>were off by multiple orders of magnitude</span></a><span>.<br><br></span></span></li>\n<li><span><span><span><span>When rating bonds, Moody&#x2019;s thought they were being careful by adding a 50% buffer, giving them a lot of room to be off in their errors. ...<a href=\"https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/GPO-FCIC/pdf/GPO-FCIC.pdf\">They were off by 20,000% right before the 2008 financial crisis</a>.<br><br></span></span></span></span></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.economist.com/node/5246700\"><span>Freakonomic&#x2019;s famous headline claim of abortion&#x2019;s impact on declining crime rates</span></a><span> ended up being completely wrong due to a spreadsheet error.<br><br></span></li>\n<li>The Princeton Election Consortium <a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/sam-wang-princeton-election-consortium-poll-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-victory-a7399671.html\"><span>gave Hillary Clinton a 99% chance of victory over Donald Trump</span></a><span>.

Questions like &#x201C;how many deaths have a given vaccine prevented over period X?&#x201D; involve making a number of choices about accounting for leverage, counterfactuals about the case and death rates in the absence of a vaccine, and knowledge of vaccine rate, efficacy, and population at all times in the given period. For example, holding all other inputs </span><a href=\"/ea/1o6/what_is_the_costeffectiveness_of_researching/\"><span>in our model</span></a><span> constant, </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18zUqZMrV7UvzYGXmOowSLvdS1pX5_GA8dgIxd8A2_yM/edit#gid=0\"><span>if we raise the estimated efficacy</span></a><span> of the malaria vaccine from 39%, which current studies suggest it is, to 75%, a figure more in line with other licensed vaccines, the cost effectiveness nearly doubles from ~$58 per DALY to ~$30 a DALY. &#xA0;Similar differences occur when changing the estimated price per person of vaccines.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Extrapolating from these initial inputs to try to estimate cost-effectiveness brings another round of uncertain decisions on how to count roll out costs, what is the fixed cost when rolling out a vaccine, what is the population to be targeted, how to count health spending by governments that lead to more direct research and development spending, and what is an economic benefit. Narrowing or widening definitions at each of these steps can change the results of your analysis significantly. Further, all of these inputs can be difficult to trace, particularly research and development spending, even in a field as well-documented as vaccination. This gives us reason to think that, at most, our analysis narrowed the range of possible values for the value of vaccination. The uncertainty around many of these key inputs also underscores the need to clearly identify and highlight the key logic and assumptions of the model.</span><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Lesson #2: It&#x2019;s good to look at the problem from multiple angles</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>So if we&#x2019;re overwhelmingly likely to make a few errors in our estimates that make us off by a large amount, what can we do to guard against this? One idea is to look at things from multiple angles. When constructing our estimate, we looked at things from four key angles and made sure they all matched up or we understood why they were wrong:</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A Guesstimate model for each vaccine we wanted to model</li>\n<li>A spreadsheet with scenario-specific estimates with a more simple model</li>\n<li>Reference to academic literature that established their own estimates with their own models</li>\n<li>Reference to our own intuitions for what feels right</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If any of these four disagreed, we would explore why. Differences between the Guesstimate and the spreadsheet were helpful for finding typos in our equations and differences between our estimates and academic literature were helpful for finding crucial considerations that we missed.</p>\n<p><span><br></span><span>We also made concrete predictions about the future and we can wait to see if they come true.</span><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Lesson #3: You should clearly itemize your assumptions</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>When assessing how our estimate could change, we found it very helpful to carefully itemize all of the key assumptions we are making, our thoughts about them, whether they were explicitly captured in our model or not, and how they would presumably affect the model. We wish more people did this as it makes it much easier to quickly understand what the model is built upon, how uncertain it is, and how someone might have arrived at different conclusions. Also, if we&#x2019;re wrong or missing something, it is very easy for people to point that out.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Lesson #4: It&#x2019;s easier in a team</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Working with a team helped make it easier to stay motivated at identifying potential mistakes. There were multiple times when either of us felt like stopping and not investigating a particular error instead of pressing further, but the other one was able to keep us on track. It was also a lot more fun.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Lesson #5: It&#x2019;s good to work in a well researched field</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>It&#x2019;s hard to reconcile your conclusions against existing academic research if there is no existing academic research. One of the primary benefits of estimating cost-effectiveness within a field like vaccination is there are many other studies in the field and comparing your results to this research theoretically provides very useful checks on your work. By looking at the work of others you can see where you may have gone wrong by comparing assumptions and checking that your model doesn&#x2019;t leave out considerations that were important factors in other models. Seeing multiple models using various assumptions underlines the importance of making your assumptions very clear and thoroughly documenting them, not only for your own clarification but so that others could compare their work to your work.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>However, making such comparisons is often very difficult to do. For example, when estimating the cost-effectiveness of a vaccine it&#x2019;s difficult to try to compare the end results of different models even holding the vaccine-specific variables constant if the models were based on different populations. Different populations, across regions or time, can have a very different DALY burden per person which can produce cost-effectiveness estimates that differ by an order of magnitude or more.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>When there isn&#x2019;t any academic research, getting feedback and independent estimates from other experts may be your next best bet.</span><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Lesson #6: Technical understanding is helpful</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>While neither of us our experts on vaccination, we both came into this project with some familiarity with vaccines given our prior work in the area that we believed helped limit errors. It&#x2019;s easy to make mistakes in model inputs given unfamiliarity with a field. To take a simple example, cost estimates for vaccinations are sometimes given in cost per dose and other times in cost per vaccination series. Further, for a given vaccine, there are sometimes competing vaccination schedules which include different numbers of doses given per person and these may be given a different ages sometimes leading to different overall efficacy. This underscores the importance of having considerable understanding of the field you are attempting to evaluate for cost-effectiveness. As technical complications mount the probability of making an error that alters your end-line conclusions increases. That there are benefits to having domain knowledge of a field you are attempting to assess is hardly an earth-shattering insight or something we hadn&#x2019;t considered before launching our analysis yet we came away from this project more convinced that it&#x2019;s an important factor in producing reliable outputs.</span><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Lesson #7: Vaccination is great, but not a slam dunk win</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>A while ago, Holden Karnofsky declared that</span><a href=\"http://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/hits-based-giving\"> <span>the Open Philanthropy Project is dedicated to &#x201C;hits-based giving&#x201D;</span></a><span>, a framework that accepts &#x201C;philanthropic risk&#x201D; where 90% of grants have zero impact but the number of grants that do have impact have sufficient impact to make the entire project worthwhile. This could be compared to the more traditional approach of GiveWell, where all grants made are to organizations where the expected value is relatively well known (</span><a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2016/07/26/deworming-might-huge-impact-might-close-zero-impact/\"><span>even if the organizations may still have zero impact</span></a><span>). </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>On one plausible reading of hits-based giving the research and development of vaccines should have been a clear &#x201C;hit,&#x201D; an intervention so cost-effective it would make up for other funding that didn&#x2019;t produce much positive. However, while our research would suggest that while some vaccines we covered were extremely cost-effective, and other vaccines currently in development have the potential to be so&#x2014;consistent with hits-based giving&#x2014;overall this basket of vaccines wasn&#x2019;t clearly superior to other possible health interventions currently available to donors, with our estimate suggesting some vaccines may be orders magnitude worse than donating to the Against Malaria Foundation (AMF).</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>There are obvious limitations with generalizing from our basket of vaccines, and with comparing these results to AMF, but our research would suggest to reach a similar level of cost-effectiveness as AMF, vaccine research would need to produce a potentially an unrealistic dollar spent per DALY averted with few if any vaccine research programs that lead to little success. Moreover, if there are many AMF-level interventions that need funding, and vaccine research doesn&#x2019;t reach this level of cost-effectiveness, this would seem to cut against philanthropic funding of vaccinations. On the other hand, it&#x2019;s important to note that vaccine development likely increased our understanding of several diseases and likely opened other health interventions, possibly including some of the best interventions available today. That is to say, it&#x2019;s plausible, for example, that bednets wouldn&#x2019;t be as effective today if smallpox wasn&#x2019;t eliminated given the health and economic benefits that resulted from the development of the smallpox vaccine.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Further, on a different reading of hits-based giving, it&#x2019;s plausible that that the goal isn&#x2019;t merely to uncover interventions as cost-effective as AMF, but rather hit the level of effectiveness probably achieved by, say, water sanitization. So, in this sense, even the development of an intervention as cost-effective as vaccines appear to be in our research wouldn&#x2019;t be a hit but other interventions, particularly those that prevented an existential risk could qualify. So, if hits-based giving produced the occasional intervention as cost-effective as vaccines, while also having many interventions that resulted in little progress, and the rare intervention that was a tremendous success this approach could still be highly promising. Of course, in the absence of the large success, it will be very difficult to judge the total cost-effectiveness of this approach and it&#x2019;s still early to know if interventions as cost-effective as vaccines will be produced using this approach.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>In short, hits-based giving would suggest vaccines would definitely be a hit, but it turned out upon detailed analysis to merely be &#x201C;okay&#x201D;. </span><span>This further underscores that AMF may be a really hard baseline to beat and that it is important to do some degree of investigation before assuming things are hits.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Lesson #8: Maybe we should eradicate more diseases?</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>If we were to try to draw some specific conclusions on vaccines, we would suggest, tentatively, a few things. Firstly, it seems clear to us, as it has to others who&#x2019;ve examined the topic, that the smallpox eradication campaign was a really good idea. We would more hesitantly add to this claim that, where it is possible, eradication is a good idea and typically much more cost-effective than vaccination efforts that stop short of eradication. Of course, the pure costs or cost-effectiveness of attempting eradication are only part of the reason such efforts are or are not made, but we&#x2019;d tentatively suggest perhaps were it is biologically feasible we&#x2019;d favor making the attempt for vaccine-preventable diseases.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Further, for modern vaccines, bringing down the per dose cost paid is very important and it appears rolling out vaccines is cost-effective relative to other possible interventions but after adding in research costs this cost-effectiveness falls considerably.</span><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Lesson #9: If there&#x2019;s a biosecurity nightmare, it may be a decade before a vaccine can be available</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Our work on estimating vaccine costs and timelines may also have some implications for biosecurity. If we urgently needed to make a new vaccine, how quickly and cheaply could we make it? $1.5B </span><a href=\"/ea/1l4/how_much_does_it_cost_to_research_and_develop_a/\"><span>was enough money</span></a><span> to get </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ebola_vaccine\"><span>eight different Ebola candidates off the ground</span></a><span>, at least </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RVSV-ZEBOV_vaccine\"><span>one of which</span></a><span> had sufficient effectiveness that while it is not yet licensed, it could be used for emergency procedures.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>The real question is not of budget, but of time. As many businesses learn in fits of frustration, you can&#x2019;t always throw more money at something to make it go faster. The Ebola vaccine </span><a href=\"/ea/1c5/how_long_does_it_take_to_research_and_develop_a/\"><span>technically took ~46 years</span></a><span>, but it wasn&#x2019;t actively developed for much of that time. Most of the Ebola vaccines have only seen </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RVSV-ZEBOV_vaccine\"><span>15-20 years of active development</span></a><span>, and I&#x2019;d roughly guess that money could have sped it up so that we go from nothing to a workable vaccine in ~10 years. While the licensing process only </span><a href=\"/ea/1c5/how_long_does_it_take_to_research_and_develop_a/\"><span>tends to add 5-7 years on average to the vaccine development timeline</span></a><span>, I&#x2019;d hope that a biosecurity emergency would allow us to cut through a lot of this if the benefits outweigh the risk.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>We also may have thought more explicitly about doing a more detailed analysis of the implications of our vaccine timeline research on biosecurity. It would be great to know how quickly, at what cost, and with what efficacy humanity could develop a vaccine in the event one urgently needed to created. While we can draw some limited lessons from the recent push since the 2014 outbreak of Ebola to create a vaccine, obviously with a sample size of 1 the case of Ebola doesn&#x2019;t necessarily generalize to what may happen in a more dire scenario.</span><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Conclusion</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>All in all, we found this project to be good practice. Sandboxing within a fairly well-known and knowable domain allowed us to gain insight from the work of others. We think that following a specific basket of vaccines, though it limits extrapolation, allowed us to create concrete case-studies which was very helpful. We also believe looking at multiple different approaches to estimating inputs and outputs improved our understanding of the field as a whole though this process takes a considerable amount of time.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Given another chance to do this analysis, there are issues we believe we would have addressed differently. We may have spent more time thinking explicitly about the likelihood that all the best opportunities for vaccination are already taken, the good highly leveraged opportunities could do today, and how often there is a new serious disease.</span></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Marcus_A_Davis"}}, {"_id": "k8adLKtEBJw7QWPK5", "title": "Introducing Charity Entrepreneurship: an Incubation and Research Program for New Charities", "postedAt": "2018-06-05T23:51:54.705Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>How do we get more EA charities started? There&#x2019;s a good case that charity entrepreneurship <a href=\"/ea/1og/why_founding_charities_is_one_of_the_highest/\">is high impact</a> for <a href=\"/ea/1p3/why_eas_in_particular_are_good_people_to_start/\">EAs</a>, but it seems not many are starting them. Part of the reason is that it&#x2019;s intimidatingly hard. Not only do you have to have multiple rare and difficult skills, but you also have to choose a good idea to begin with. And if people are put off by the uncertainty of career selection, that&#x2019;s nothing compared to the sheer ambiguity of all the potential interventions one could run. That is why we are starting a new program called <a href=\"http://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/\">Charity Entrepreneurship</a>. We will make yearly charity startup recommendations, much like what GiveWell does for donations and 80,000 Hours does for careers. This research will be accompanied by an incubation program, similar to Y Combinator, that will teach people the prerequisite skills to start a nonprofit. In this post I&#x2019;ll explain more about the rationale, details, history, and plans moving forward.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>History</h2>\n<p>The first project undertaken by Charity Entrepreneurship (CE) was 6 months of research in 2016 by 4 full time staff (~24 staff months). This resulted in <a href=\"https://www.charitysciencehealth.com/\">Charity Science Health</a> being founded, which has since received two GiveWell incubation grants and assisted over 200,000 families in India. This was the primary goal of this project and we feel CE succeeded. However, in a another way, CE was much more successful than we anticipated. Another project, <a href=\"/ea/1g1/introducing_fortify_health_an_eaaligned_charity/\">Fortify Health</a>, was founded, helped by our <a href=\"http://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/charity-ideas.html\">intervention recommendation</a>, mentorship, and seed grants. Not only that, but several other EAs and non-EA charity founders showed a large interest in founding high impact ideas, such as the ones we had researched, although we did not have the ability to support more than two groups at the time.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>How it will work</h2>\n<p>The organization&#x2019;s time will be broken down into three sections. The first section will be <a href=\"/ea/1lz/why_we_should_be_doing_more_systematic_research/\">systematic empirical research</a> into an intervention area focused on finding the highest impact gaps to found a charity in. This will result in a list of &#x201C;top charities to found in X area&#x201D;, much like our <a href=\"http://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/charity-ideas.html\">published list from our last round</a>. The second part will be a two month <a href=\"http://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/incubation-program.html\">summer incubation program</a> equivalent to about a summer term university course load, focused on building the practical skills need to found a charity. The third section will be a seed grant and weekly mentoring sessions for the organizations that are founded out of the program, similar to the support we were able to give Fortify Health. We believe this program has potential to found 1-3 GiveWell incubation/ACE recommended equivalent charities a year.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Each year a different area will be chosen to focus on, with research being aimed at prioritizing specific possible charities within that area, as opposed to actively comparing across them. This is for multiple reasons. Firstly, in the time it would take to feel very confident in prioritizing one cause area over another, we could have incubated a good charity in each of the top cause areas. Secondly, there is a limited pool of people interested in starting organizations in each area, so focusing on putting out marginal recommendations in one field will lead to less output than switching between them periodically. Thirdly, given the extremely uncertain nature of doing good, rotating between cause areas makes the impact more robust in case one of our assumptions or beliefs are very wrong. This perspective also aligns well with the recent writing on <a href=\"/ea/1g7/in_defence_of_epistemic_modesty/\">epistemic humility</a> which we found persuasive. The area we are running the first year on is animal rights, and for the next year we are considering far future and mental health, among others. We already have <a href=\"http://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/charity-ideas.html\">recommendations listed for global poverty</a> and count CSH and Fortify Health as a somewhat informal first year of running this project.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Case for impact</h2>\n<p>The case for why charity entrepreneurship is effective has already been made <a href=\"/ea/1p3/why_eas_in_particular_are_good_people_to_start/\">here</a>, <a href=\"/ea/151/what_is_the_expected_value_of_creating_a_givewell/\">here</a>, <a href=\"/ea/pi/why_charity_entrepreneurship/\">here</a> and <a href=\"/ea/1og/why_founding_charities_is_one_of_the_highest/\">here</a>. I&#x2019;ll make the case for how Charity Entrepreneurship as an organization has impact in this section.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>CE&#x2019;s impact hinges on two factors - the counterfactuals of the staff running the organization and the counterfactuals of the participants. My personal counterfactuals would be starting another direct nonprofit myself. The benefits of CE compared to this is that, while I think I could start another good charity, it takes about 3-8 years to take a charity from starting to being able to run without the founders. On the other hand, with CE we would be able to launch an expected 2-3 charities through our program every year. While I may be an above average charity founder, I do not predict that I am 6 to 24 times better than the incubatees.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Which brings us to their counterfactuals. Some people would undoubtedly start charities without our aid, but many wouldn&#x2019;t. Fortify Health for instance, has said that they think they wouldn&#x2019;t have started their organization without my mentorship and initial funding. Making the leap from structured jobs to the uncertainty of entrepreneurship without a guide and some initial money is intimidating enough to turn off a lot of people. Providing a structure, education, guidance, and seed funding can help a lot of people gain the confidence to make the switch. Additionally, the support makes it more likely that they&#x2019;ll run a higher quality organization, making better decisions and having a broader skill set than simply jumping in. The assistance will also help them stick with it at the beginning when things are particularly challenging. It&#x2019;s easier to keep going when there&#x2019;s a setback if you have a coach encouraging you to keep going. Part of the inspiration for this is to be what we wish we had when we had started.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Aside from the direct effects of causing more people to join, there&#x2019;s the benefit of choosing a better idea. Most startups are started based on jumping on the first opportunity the founder sees rather than systematically comparing their options. This can sometimes lead to good ideas but is dominated by comparing between alternatives, <a href=\"/ea/1lz/why_we_should_be_doing_more_systematic_research/\">which I go into more deeply here</a>. Furthermore, far more time and expertise will be put into prioritizing the interventions. Even if the founder might have put some effort into comparing their best options, it&#x2019;s hard for an individual to put in the multiple person-years that will go into our research. Lastly, the intervention prioritization will be done by people who have specialized in and have a track record in choosing good ones. All of this combined will lead to higher impact charities getting started than otherwise would have.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>How you can get involved</h2>\n<p>If you want to help this project you can:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Apply to <a href=\"http://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/incubation-program.html\">our incubation program</a>.</strong> The next session will be held in the summer of 2019.

We&#x2019;re soliciting more players than ever to join relevant mailing lists, e.g. for The Life You Can Save and for other organizations that promote effective giving (including the charities that players voted for during their GG). About 34% of all respondents opt into joining TLYCS&#x2019;s mailing list; 54% join at least one mailing list. This is powerful evidence that we can leverage GG into ongoing effective communication with participants. </span><a href=\"https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Portals/0/Giving%20Games%20Annual%20Report%202017.pdf#page=4\"><span>Learn more</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Building the evidence base around GG.</span><span> The postgame survey data we&#x2019;re collecting is so far</span></p>\n<p><span>indicating that GG participants generally have a highly positive view of the experience.

There are some good additions to this list there from others.</em></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<section>\n<div><hr></div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<h3>&#xA0;</h3>\n<p><em>CN: Reference to suicide in section 8.</em></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>You should try to do more good in the world because it&#x2019;s the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, this isn&#x2019;t always sufficient motivation for people to act accordingly, so altruists[1] often tell non-altruists about the personal benefits of altruism&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;the evidence that <a href=\"https://goo.gl/PB3y5i\">giving makes you happier</a>, the friendly and supportive communities of altruists you can join, the sense of meaning altruism can bring to fill the void left by an increasingly secular world, and so on.</p>\n<p>But leading an altruistic life is not always plain sailing, and I think it&#x2019;s important to acknowledge that from time to time. And not only to acknowledge that times get rough, but the <em>specific ways</em> in which they get rough. Otherwise your words are in danger of being dismissed as just another motivational quotation people have become numb to, or as advice that applies to other people (&#x201C;but <em>my</em> problems are probably different&#x201D;).</p>\n<p>One of the most valuable things I&#x2019;ve heard in the past couple of years is a string of entrepreneurs admitting that steering your own course is <em>hard</em> and explaining some of the reasons why. There&#x2019;s no map. You take responsibility for deciding where you and everyone else on board is heading. Most of the time you feel like you don&#x2019;t have a clue what you&#x2019;re doing and you marvel that you so often find the motivation to have a go anyway and look like you know what you&#x2019;re doing.</p>\n<p>And so with the current charity that I&#x2019;m running, I find myself persisting much more easily than I have in the past because I recognise that <em>it&#x2019;s supposed to feel like this</em>. If I&#x2019;m tempted to crumble under the stress of thinking on Monday that we should be going left and Tuesday that we should be going right, I don&#x2019;t write myself off as useless. &#x201C;No,&#x201D; I tell myself, &#x201C;this is leadership, remember? Carry on.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Every life requires leadership, including altruistic lives. But some challenges are more specific to altruistic lives, and those are the challenges I wish to start to address in this article. I&#x2019;ll begin by recognising some of the difficulties most commonly associated with altruism, and then move on to some less obvious challenges.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s important to remember with each of the following areas that even an entirely altruistic person shouldn&#x2019;t give to the point that they burn out. You may agree with my tentative opinion that most people in the world could give a lot more than they currently do&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;and a great deal more than they think they could&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;without a significant risk of burn-out if they take things slowly, thanks to the underappreciated <a href=\"https://goo.gl/mkzNxC\">hedonic treadmill</a>. But since it&#x2019;s difficult to predict the point at which you&#x2019;ll burn out, it is wise to slow down a safe distance before wherever you expect that point to be[2].</p>\n<h3>&#xA0;</h3>\n<h3>&#xA0;</h3>\n<h3>8 areas where altruism has asked something of&#xA0;me</h3>\n<h4>&#xA0;</h4>\n<h4>1. A &#x201C;do no (significant) harm&#x201D; lifestyle</h4>\n<p>The altruist tends to set themselves higher standards of day-to-day ethical behaviour in an attempt to avoid causing harm through e.g. consumer habits or personal interactions.</p>\n<p>The most significant change for me has probably been veganism, but some people of course go much further for much longer and it can take a lot from you.</p>\n<h4>&#xA0;</h4>\n<h4>2. Material comfort &amp; financial security</h4>\n<blockquote>Whoever has two tunics should share with him who has none (Luke 3:11)</blockquote>\n<blockquote>[I]f it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything of comparable moral importance, we ought, morally, to do it. (Peter Singer, 1972)</blockquote>\n<p>It doesn&#x2019;t take long for the altruist to realise that even if they don&#x2019;t have much money by some standard, they usually should still be <a href=\"https://goo.gl/okG92A\">giving something</a> to those who have less, meaning less disposable income for material comforts, enjoyable experiences, savings etc.[3] Perhaps more significantly, it can mean accepting a lower standard of living than that of their peers.</p>\n<p>And it&#x2019;s not just money. I&#x2019;m honoured to know someone who told himself &#x201C;Whoever has two kidneys should share with him who has none&#x201D; and bloody did so for a stranger.</p>\n<h4>&#xA0;</h4>\n<h4>3. Career and spare&#xA0;time</h4>\n<p>Many altruists go so far as to choose, change or extend their career in pursuit of greater positive impact, but at significant cost to themselves e.g. doing a job that&#x2019;s more stressful, for lower pay, that&#x2019;s further away from family and friends and/or that eats into their retirement.</p>\n<p>Altruistic side projects can also consume evenings, weekends and holidays, crowding out hobbies and family/social/love lives perhaps to the point of non-existence.</p>\n<h4>&#xA0;</h4>\n<h4>4. Facing what you&#x2019;re not giving, and what you&#x2019;ll never be able to&#xA0;give</h4>\n<p>Giving something means taking your head out of the sand.</p>\n<p>You give because you&#x2019;ve taken the brave step of facing the problems in the world and admitting that you should be doing something&#x2026;and now that you&#x2019;ve given up your excuses for not helping at all, you may be out of reasons for why you should stop helping where you have.</p>\n<p>Cue potentially even more guilt than when you were giving nothing.</p>\n<p>Facing the world&#x2019;s problems also means facing up to the fact that you will never solve them all. Your contribution will at most be a drop in the ocean, and the more you contribute, the bigger you&#x2019;ll realise the ocean is. Most days I&#x2019;m encouraged by asking myself &#x201C;<a href=\"https://goo.gl/r8S6hy\">What if that drop was my daughter?</a>&#x201D;. But some days that&#x2019;s not enough to keep the feelings of hopelessness at bay.</p>\n<h4>&#xA0;</h4>\n<h4>5. Social approval and connection</h4>\n<p>On the face of it, altruism attracts social approval. I don&#x2019;t dispute this, but altruism can also lead to a good deal of social disapproval and disconnection in less expected ways. To name a few:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your family and friends may feel neglected or unappreciated.</li>\n<li>You may feel more distant from family, friends and colleagues who don&#x2019;t share your dedication to doing good, both as a result of an inability to bond over something that&#x2019;s important to you, and as a result of seeing people you&#x2019;re close to speak and act with what may seem like such callousness from where you&#x2019;re standing.</li>\n<li>You can be looked down on in &#x201C;macho&#x201D; or individualistic cultures, or even by other altruists&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;I sometimes get fellow altruists looking at me like there&#x2019;s something wrong with me when they realise how much I try to optimise my life for social good.</li>\n<li>If you&#x2019;re particularly public about your giving (arguably the <a href=\"https://goo.gl/zJ4kLr\">most impactful approach</a> to take), a lot of people will interpret it as smug self-righteousness.</li>\n<li>If you&#x2019;re committed enough to actively try to persuade others to join you in trying to make the world a better place, people will generally be irritated by such attempts.</li>\n<li>Even when you&#x2019;re not being particularly public or actively trying to persuade others, many people will assume that you&#x2019;re implicitly judging them and dislike you all the same (ever seen a meat-eater deliver a monologue defending their dietary choices, provoked only by the observation that someone else present is a vegetarian?).</li>\n<li>You&#x2019;re going to have to form some ethical opinions, which are the most divisive kind of opinions to hold (no discussing religion or politics at the dinner table).</li>\n<li>By doing something but not <em>everything</em>, you open yourself up to the charge of hypocrisy.</li>\n<li>The worst attacks may in fact come from your otherwise potential allies as a result of <a href=\"https://goo.gl/qgdYW3\">infighting</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>&#xA0;</h4>\n<h4>6. Figuring out how to do good&#xA0;better</h4>\n<p>A common reason people don&#x2019;t make any attempt to help is that they don&#x2019;t know how to. Bingo! Unbeknownst to them, they&#x2019;ve just identified the first step in helping: Putting some (more) effort into figuring out how.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, people seem not to realise this is an option to a surprising extent, assuming that &#x201C;helping&#x201D; has to be direct. If you avoid supporting a bereaved friend because you don&#x2019;t know what to say, that doesn&#x2019;t get you off the hook&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;helping in this case just means doing some research into helpful things to say in such situations and then talking to your friend.</p>\n<p>And it doesn&#x2019;t always mean more work. If you&#x2019;d be prepared to spend your holidays volunteering if only an opportunity you trusted to make a difference fell in your lap, consider spending the first day of your holidays volunteering in the form of researching valuable volunteering opportunities.</p>\n<blockquote>Give me six hours to chop down a tree and I will spend the first four sharpening the axe. (Commonly attributed to Abraham Lincoln)</blockquote>\n<p>So far, so easy. But sometimes figuring out how you can help is a <em>lot</em> of work, especially as you move from &#x201C;making a difference&#x201D; territory into &#x201C;making the <em>most </em>difference&#x201D; territory, and as you become increasingly <a href=\"https://goo.gl/UWPmeh\">aware of what you don&#x2019;t know</a>.</p>\n<p>Morality is a discipline with few experts, who very few people defer to, and many of whom unhelpfully claim that ethics is all relative anyway.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s a pursuit in which there is no feedback to tell you if you&#x2019;ve ever ultimately done the right thing.</p>\n<p>And it&#x2019;s a world where sooner or later you&#x2019;re going to come across the <a href=\"https://goo.gl/jSM2VB\">Effective Altruism</a> crowd who&#x2019;ll implore you to bring philosophy, decision theory, psychology, physics, computer science, mathematics, data analysis, economics, politics, history, anthropology, sociology, biology, chemistry and Defence Against the Dark Arts[4] to bear on your bright-eyed question, &#x201C;How can I do the most good?&#x201D; (Don&#x2019;t get me wrong&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;I generally find the Effective Altruism community to be hugely insightful, inspiring and supportive, but the intellectual challenge it rises to can feel overwhelming.)</p>\n<h4>&#xA0;</h4>\n<h4>7. Other&#xA0;values</h4>\n<p>Many altruists distinguish (although perhaps not clearly) between their &#x201C;world-saving&#x201D; values and their &#x201C;personal&#x201D; values, which are often in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3S2PqhtCO1E\">conflict</a>. Examples of personal values that influence my own behaviour include: spirituality, art, family, truth, authenticity (including self-expression), purity, and even particular forms of charity that I don&#x2019;t think have much impact but are close to my heart.</p>\n<p>Choosing actions that are more in accordance with one&#x2019;s world-saving values rather than one&#x2019;s personal values might be considered a form of sacrifice that cuts particularly deep, but perhaps &#x201C;sacrifice&#x201D; is the wrong way to think about such choices. Either way, and regardless of the eventual choice one makes when these values conflict, we can at least acknowledge the stress caused by such tensions.</p>\n<h4>&#xA0;</h4>\n<h4>8. Life&#xA0;itself</h4>\n<p>Some people give their lives for a cause. Some people I know give their deaths. By this I mean: they think they would have ended their own suffering by now were it not for their commitment to improve the lives of others.</p>\n<p>You may consider this a personal benefit of altruism if you believe that suicide is usually/always a mistake&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;a harm to oneself&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;and that therefore anything that prevents one from following through on suicide ideation must be a good thing. But even so, it is an act of heroism to find the strength to continue living for the greater good when one&#x2019;s own life is so full of pain[5].</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<figure></figure>\n<p>Feel free to add other ways that altruism has challenged you in the comments[6]. Or let me know if you think I&#x2019;ve generalised too much anywhere or have said something you think I shouldn&#x2019;t have (<a href=\"https://goo.gl/PNRTHF\">anonymously</a> if you prefer).</p>\n<p>I should add that I partly wrote this for you and I partly wrote this for me. I think I would benefit from hearing others say &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not just you&#x201D; with respect to some of the above. And the next time&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;or the first time&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;any of you encounter one of these challenges, remember that <em>it&#x2019;s supposed to feel like this</em>. Not every altruist will feel the force of these challenges of course, but enough do that you shouldn&#x2019;t think that this is you failing or that this is an unexpected, unsurmountable hurdle&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;this is all part of the journey, and many find a way forward. <a href=\"https://goo.gl/usgtMB\">There&#x2019;s some good in this world, and it&#x2019;s worth fighting for</a>. The fight can get ugly and I wouldn&#x2019;t blame anyone for surrendering. But you&#x2019;re not in this alone, and I fucking love you for fighting alongside me.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section>\n<div><hr></div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>[1]Who I&#x2019;m defining as &#x201C;people currently trying to make &#x2018;doing good&#x2019; a serious part of their lives&#x201D;. Please excuse the pious-sounding black-and-white shorthand and the use of a word that tends to distract people with debates about whether &#x201C;true&#x201D; altruism &#x201C;really&#x201D; exists.</p>\n<p>[2]In such situations, you may worry that you&#x2019;re just making excuses to yourself&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;that &#x201C;avoiding burn-out&#x201D; is just a disguise for selfish behaviour that harms your altruistic goals. An exercise I often find revealing here is to imagine that I have a (competent) manager who has the responsibility of using me as effectively as possible to make the world a better place. Would such a manager encourage me to try harder or to take a break right now? I am less dismissive of this hypothetical advice than I am of the advice of friends, who understandably have more empathy with my well-being than my altruistic goals.</p>\n<p>[3]A couple of tricks here:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It&#x2019;s easier and often just as impactful to <em>resist the temptation to increase spending as your salary increases</em> than it is to decrease spending (h/t Toby Ord, 2010).</li>\n<li>We live to our means. When you have the mindset of never having quite enough, <em>regardless of how much money you actually have, </em>you&#x2019;ll never feel that you can afford to give much away. So admit to yourself that you don&#x2019;t need infinite money, start to put numbers on what you consider reasonable amounts of spending and saving, and donate anything you earn above that. If you&#x2019;re lucky enough to earn above the median salary in your country, that can be a good benchmark&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;if half the country can manage on less than that, perhaps you can too.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>[4]<a href=\"https://goo.gl/rTriaG\">Not even kidding</a>.</p>\n<p>[5]If you experience suicidal thoughts, I strongly encourage you to <a href=\"https://goo.gl/zTKYbr\">seek immediate support</a> as well as to try more long-term professional help (and to try several different therapies/therapists/medications if the first does not help).</p>\n<p>[6]I do also want to acknowledge that, luckily for me, I haven&#x2019;t yet felt called to make the kind of extreme sacrifices that the heroes in the stories we tell have made.

I know I\u2019ve certainly been in that situation a few times in the past, but instead have lost time doing unimportant and menial jobs in order to be able to get by financially. Talented effective altruists losing time like this is especially tragic given that a lot of cause areas are currently <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2017/11/talent-gaps-survey-2017/\">constrained by the amount of quality direct work being done</a> in them.</p>\n<p>Buildings in the seaside holiday resort of Blackpool (UK) are really cheap. I\u2019ve bought a 17 bedroom hotel with dining room, lounge and bar for <a href=\"http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/property-58714915.html\">\u00a3130k</a>. Assuming a 7% rental yield (which is reasonably high), this works out at about \u00a345 per person per month rent. Factoring in bills, catering, and a modest stipend/entertainment budget, living costs could be as low as \u00a35700/person/year (or lower for people sharing rooms, see <a href=\"#section9\">budget</a>). This is amazing value for hotel living with all basic services provided.</p>\n<p>The idea is to invite people to live there, with all their expenses covered by donors, for up to two years. Funding is already in place (via me) for the first year of operations. The project will be managed by someone who lives on site and deals with all the admin/finances, shopping/cooking/cleaning/laundry, socials/events and morale - they will also have free living expenses, and be paid a modest salary. Note that this should be considered as a potential high impact, high prestige supporting role, for those excited to be involved in such a capacity on an EA mission. Guests will be free from concerns of material survival, and be able to have prolonged and uninterrupted focus on whatever projects they are working on. Obviously these will be largely limited to purely desk-based, or remote work. Potential people suited to being guests are those who want to:</p>\n<p>- self-study economics, philosophy, science, AI, programming etc, in order to contribute to future efforts in various EA cause areas, without having to worry about - or waste time - getting (mostly irrelevant or menial) paid work in order to fund themselves</p>\n<p>- immerse themselves in desk-based research/writing on an EA-related subject without having to worry about fundraising, a job, grants, teaching, tenure etc.</p>\n<p>- work on a mostly software or research based start-up/project(/phase of a project) without having to worry about runway (be it for profit with a view to earning to give, or an EA-aligned/adjacent charity)</p>\n<p>A somewhat out of the way location with little in the way of outside distractions most of the year, combined with fully catered living arrangements, should be ideal for engaging in <a href=\"http://calnewport.com/books/deep-work/\">deep work</a> (usual <a href=\"https://thomas-sittler.github.io/facebook/\">focusing</a> <a href=\"https://imgur.com/cPMpm4h\">hacks</a> applied)</p>\n<p>Whilst a simple pledge to work on useful EA things is required (\u201cI pledge to work towards doing the most good that I can whilst staying at the hotel\u201d), there is no formal requirement for people to produce more value than is put in to help them. Given the low costs involved, it\u2019s a fairly low bar to clear though - produce more value in a year than \u00a35700 donated to the most effective charity (+ opportunity cost; for more see <a href=\"/ea/1pc/ea_hotel_with_free_accommodation_and_board_for/#section6\">Value Proposition</a> section). And just one major success will make the whole thing worth it. A useful analogy might be a <a href=\"https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/accommodation/pg/residences/deanscourt/\">catered and managed</a> <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16WphL2u8BGU7Ol0qz-1ocHJKvdJpYVaJNdHA3IZECec/edit\">university residence</a> (paid for by a grant), or perhaps even <a href=\"https://medium.com/@bagelboy/make-america-bohemian-again-de846e35d757\">New York\u2019s Chelsea Hotel, which produced billions of dollars worth of art, despite many guests not paying rent</a> (and was an inspiration for this project). The slightly anarchic feel to it with a lack of formal structure does appeal too. Not requiring people to submit detailed grant applications is also something that may seem like a breath of fresh air to people used to continually chasing funding against the odds. This can only be fairly done though if assuming a relatively low demand. Which I expect from it being in Blackpool and not somewhere more happening like London or the Bay Area. Of course if demand levels increase to be significantly higher than supply, then this can be reassessed.</p>\n<p>Read on for more detail, or skip to the final section (<a href=\"#section8\">Next Steps</a>) to get involved!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Outline</h1>\n<p><a href=\"#section2\">Life at the EA Hotel</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#section3\">Why Blackpool?</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#section4\">The Hotel Manager</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#section5\">Other uses for the hotel</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#section6\">Value proposition</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#section7\">Sustainability, risks and organisation</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#section8\">Next Steps</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#section8-1\">Acknowledgements</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#section8-2\">Footnotes</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"#section9\">Appendix: Budget</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Life at the EA Hotel</h1>\n<p>Facilities at the hotel will be fairly basic, but adequate for anyone accustomed to living in an average house-share or student residence in a European country. In fact, given that two thirds of the rooms have en suite bathrooms, it might be a cut above what many people are used to, at least in that regard. A sense of community will be encouraged through shared meals and regular socialising, but given the work focus, perhaps the vibe will lean more toward \u201cmonastery\u201d than \u201cparty house\u201d, although capturing some of the spirit of <a href=\"https://www.eaglobal.org/\">EA Globals</a> would be nice.</p>\n<p>Given the location and the aesthetics, living at the hotel will perhaps have more appeal for people who don\u2019t care about status so much, at least in the usual ways (shiny things, cool locations, luxuries, start-up style offices etc). It will appeal more to people who care about concrete achievements, and furthering their EA goals, over signalling (counter-signalling of virtue notwithstanding!).</p>\n<p>Having low levels of noise and general disruption most of the time will be required for the hotel to be a productive environment (evening socialising excepted). To this end, cleaning will be done at set times (say a weekend rotor, with each room being done at roughly the same time every week; weekends being when people are least likely to be either working, sleeping, or in their rooms<a href=\"#ftnt1\">[1]</a>), and sound insulation can be put in if need be. The roads adjacent to the hotel are generally very quiet, being side streets. In the summer, with many holiday makers in the area there is more noise coming from outside, but so far (a couple of weeks into holiday season) this hasn\u2019t been too much of an issue. For working, desks will be provided in each room, and fast internet (broadband services are currently limited to \u201cup to <a href=\"https://www.uswitch.com/broadband/postcode_checker/results/?postcode=FY1%205AQ\">76Mb</a>\u201d. There is reasonable <a href=\"https://www.nperf.com/en/map/GB/2655459.Blackpool/322.Three/signal/\">4G coverage</a> though). There are also plenty of tables in both the bar and dining room, and seating in the lounge, for people to work at outside of meal times. These areas will also be useful for group work, meetings, workshops and events (see <a href=\"#section5\">below</a>). The bar (pictured below<a href=\"#ftnt2\">[2]</a>) can seat 40 people, the dining room 32 and the lounge 12. Perhaps a convention could be made for one of the large rooms to be for working, and the other socialising, outside of mealtimes, evenings and weekends. This would help people who benefit from having separate work-and non-work locations, and help keep groups on task (less distraction from other groups having a break and socialising).</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995139/mirroredImages/JdqHvyy2Tjcj3nKoD/rlv7ldszdw7agqig1f0x.jpg\"><em>EA Hotel bar (I published this post from the table in the corner)<br></em></p>\n<p>Given zoning regulations in Blackpool, the hotel will remain nominally as a public facing hotel. Whilst in general there will be no advertising to the public (online or elsewhere), and normal prices will be set at the high end of the market, the option to host non-EA guests will be there. This will likely only be exercised in order to bolster the financial health of the project if necessary; \u201cNo Vacancies\u201d signs feature in the front windows by default. Having the odd few outsiders stay might be good for the health of the community though, to guard against it becoming too insular.</p>\n<p>Guests will be free to have their own guests stay in their rooms, but if they aren\u2019t EAs doing EA work, then they will be required to contribute toward costs (at something like the cost price - \u00a310-15/day food and accommodation. See <a href=\"#section9\">budget</a>). The same will apply for partners (costs for double rooms will be about 25% less per person). Most of the rooms are double rooms, and some are twin and even family rooms (three beds). Given this, EA couples, or groups of two or three good friends staying in the same room, could increase the capacity of the hotel and further boost its expected cost effectiveness. Small groups are also welcome even if not sharing a room, e.g. early stage EA startups, or already formed study/research groups (like the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/AISafetyCamp/\">AI Safety Camp</a>). If possible, they could have their own \u201cwing\u201d of the hotel, or even a whole floor.</p>\n<p>There is a licensed bar at the hotel. Maintaining this could help with sustainable revenue, although having someone work on the bar could make it net negative given the relatively little that EAs tend to drink. Perhaps the bar could be open infrequently - say Friday nights and special occasions. In any case, it will be best to restrict its opening to a few hours in the evening, to minimise noise and distraction. However, after dinner events will likely be a regular feature. Expect people giving talks about their work, structured group discussions, and games (I have got a couple of old CEA/FHI favourites - Resistance and Pandemic, plus <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/03/pandemic-legacy-is-the-best-board-game-ever-but-is-it-fun/\">Pandemic Legacy</a> for a twist).</p>\n<p>The food will be all vegan, with plenty of variety and healthy yet tasty meals being provided (at a consistent quality that will likely be significantly higher than most who cook for themselves are used to - think something like <a href=\"https://www.bosh.tv/\">this</a>), all without guests having to plan, shop, cook, or clean up! Veganism is fairly mainstream in EA now, given the presence of animals in most people\u2019s moral circles, so hopefully this won\u2019t put off too many potential guests<a href=\"#ftnt3\">[3]</a>. Special dietary requirements (e.g. food allergies) will be catered for. Cleaning and laundry will also be done for guests; sheets and towels changed once a week. Basic concierge services will be provided like taking deliveries of mail and packages. Having not only free accommodation, but also free meals, and cleaning and laundry done for them, will enable guests to increase their productivity by giving them not only 1-2 hours more time per day, but also a lighter cognitive load, and less stress. Whilst not the lap of luxury - no room service, or daily fresh sheets - this is still a pretty high standard of living, for a very low cost (and free to guests).</p>\n<p>With the all inclusive services of set mealtimes and menus, laundry and cleaning, the hotel will be more suited to people who are flexible and easy going. Options for self-service laundry, and basic food and drink preparation facilities (kettle in room, microwave in communal area) will be made available however, for people who are more particular with their eating and clothes washing. There is also cost-price meal-replacement powder available via Queal, as per a generous <a href=\"https://queal.com/ea\">offer</a> from founder Floris Wolswijk (with thanks to Remmelt Ellen). Communal mealtimes will be encouraged though, as a way for camaraderie and a sense of community to develop amongst guests. Friendships will be formed, problems, and their solutions, discussed, and some amount of fun and laughter will be had too hopefully! Also, some people may find that the inevitable discussion of work that will arise will lead to some amount of peer pressure that will aid in keeping them productive.</p>\n<p>Such peer pressure could also work in reverse too though, causing people to dread having to talk to people, and hide away in their rooms when they are procrastinating a lot. Or maybe it will have little effect and unproductive people will end up being the most social. Which could be good for morale, but perhaps dent others\u2019 productivity (this was me, and some other Grad Bar regulars, during most of my PhD). People slacking off/procrastinating too much is a potential problem in terms of how much value the hotel creates. I have mixed feelings about this as someone who procrastinated for the majority of my PhD. It was during that procrastination that I read LessWrong, read about proto-EA stuff, researched 3D printing and open source hardware, which became a business for me after, etc. Sometimes having that kind of flexibility can lead to things that wouldn\u2019t have happened in more stringent environments. Giving people freedom to do what they want can be a good thing, as long as their motivations are aligned (i.e. are EA; see <a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/macro-vs-micro-optimization\">e.g.</a>).</p>\n<p>Others may respond to a more structured setting though. Having attended the <a href=\"http://aisafety.camp/about-the-camps/\">AI Safety Camp</a> in Gran Canaria, where there is some overlap between the attendees and potential guests at the hotel, I have updated in terms of potential guests being more conscientious. Camp attendees were very diligent and productive, but some of this could be attributed to the external demand of having to present their work at the end of the 10 days. To provide some structure at the hotel, having someone fulfil a role of \u201cwork coordinator\u201d could be useful (H/T Maia Pasek). Such a coordinator would be available for people to meet with to discuss their work, and help resolve any issues they may have (connect them to helpful people, suggest strategies for increasing output etc). I think it would be more fitting with the stress-minimising free living nature of the hotel to not require mandatory meetings with such a coordinator, but if people feel they need a motivation kick, they could ask for regular meetings. The hotel manager could perhaps fulfil this role during the 3 hours of office hours <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bTwMRAD4TQjvHZ0eRCsN4uFdN5Se4zdcP1ikFOKj6-4/edit#gid=1310785736\">timetabled</a> for giving advice/mentoring. In terms of guarding against people becoming freeloaders (or effectively squatters), perhaps there could be a mandatory minimum of very brief (one page) reports on progress to be filed every three months. There would also be some indirect self-generated pressure from guests worrying about donors getting their money\u2019s worth (although perhaps this will only be applicable for the more highly scrupulous). But then there would have to be a mechanism for chucking people out if they are achieving very little. The hard cap of two years on length of free stays per person will be an ultimate limiter, but it might be prudent to proceed with caution regarding taking on long term residents (perhaps a three month probation period would be useful).</p>\n<p>Truly strong reasons for ejecting people from the hotel would be severe conflict between guests or abuse. To this end, a code of conduct, and conflict resolution procedures would be put in place. These can be adapted from what EA Global has in place, <a href=\"https://www.eaglobal.org/code/\">for example</a>. Guests and staff would be required to agree to abide by them at the start of their tenancies/contracts. When it comes to the practicalities of implementing such policies, having people skilled and experienced in such matters (especially the Hotel Manager) would be ideal.</p>\n<p>Guests who have problems with executive function and motivation might benefit from various methods of self-improvement. It is expected that these will largely be practiced in a self-organised manner amongst guests (with the encouragement of the manager<a href=\"#ftnt4\">[4]</a>), although the odd workshop (such as <a href=\"http://www.rationality.org/\">CFAR</a>) wouldn\u2019t go amiss for those who are keen. Guests with problems that extend beyond the financial and those which can be hacked away at with self-improvement methods would <a href=\"/ea/1k6/the_almighty_hive_will/d7f\">benefit from having understanding people around</a>. Perhaps a counsellor even. The Hotel Manager could double as a \u201c<a href=\"http://www.startrek.com/database_article/guinan\">morale officer</a>\u201d, but may not have enough time for many people needing help. Having another member of staff as a full time morale officer/mentor/work coordinator would significantly add to costs, but might be worth it in terms of potential payoff. Although having said this, I think just having a strong community will be enough to keep most people motivated, in good spirits and productive.</p>\n<p>Some guests might appreciate having companion animals around (e.g. cats or dogs), for comfort, stress relief, or maybe even to help viscerally expand their moral circle of concern. The down sides are feeding them non-vegan diets, increasing wild animal suffering (e.g. cats catching birds) and food hygiene issues (e.g. dogs eating human food in kitchen). On balance I think the default of no non-human animals might be best, but if many guests want to live with one, and there are no strong objections from other guests, then it\u2019s a possibility.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Why Blackpool?</h1>\n<p>Property prices in the north of England are very low compared to the population centres of the South-East. In particular, towns that have seen their economies decline, such as Blackpool, are perhaps upwards of ten times cheaper than London. Note that Blackpool is fairly close to Manchester (1hr drive, 1.5hr train/bus), where the newly active <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/meetup-group-YxMmJFwL/\">EA Manchester</a> is. It has the benefits of being in a rich anglophone country with stable and relatively easy to navigate institutions. Although visas may be an issue for people outside of the EU (and with Brexit, perhaps increasingly for people within the EU too). Alternatives with similar low costs and relative stability (and a better climate!) can be found in South-East Asia (some work has been done before researching <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ZHN2WEl97_lV053jvbn1Nyb_KpaK9q8mZ2BKkKxPupI/edit#gid=0\">low cost locations for EA hubs</a>). However, I have strong personal ties to the UK, and as such, as funder and instigator of the project, prefer it to be within reasonable reach.</p>\n<p>Regarding quality of life, Blackpool may be fairly dull most of the year (outside holiday season), but there is a certain charm to the bleakness of the beach in off season, with its wide open vistas largely empty of people, the sea, and wheeling murmurations of starlings (see picture below<a href=\"#ftnt5\">[5]</a>). Walks featuring long horizons are good for thinking. The <a href=\"https://www.skylinewebcams.com/en/webcam/united-kingdom/england/blackpool/blackpool.html\">beach</a> is just two minutes\u2019 walk from the hotel. There is also the picturesque and <a href=\"https://inews.co.uk/news/environment/blackpools-stanley-park-named-best-park-uk/\">award winning</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanley_Park,_Blackpool\">Stanley Park</a> just a mile inland. The national parks of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_District\">Lake District</a>, and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yorkshire_Dales\">Yorkshire Dales</a>, and several <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/maps/search/aonb/@54.3433956,-3.0741002,9z\">Areas of Outstanding Natural Beauty</a> are also relatively nearby. And Scotland isn\u2019t that far. Anyway, given 10-20 EAs living together, and regular visitors, a vibrant community can be built around the hotel itself. The local economy may be in decline, but that shouldn\u2019t matter too much as we're largely independent of it in terms of the work we are doing. It\u2019s nice to be in a place with lots going on; a big city like London, or Manchester, for example. However, when it comes down to it, many people who live in such vibrant places often fail to take full advantage of them. One of the reasons my housemates and I moved to Manchester last year was that it\u2019s a big city with a lot going on. However, in practice we rarely left the house, so as I said a few times - we might as well have been in Blackpool! Manchester is also only an hour to an hour-and-a-half away, should people staying at the Blackpool hotel feel the need for more entertainment than Blackpool can provide.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995140/mirroredImages/JdqHvyy2Tjcj3nKoD/oo5xkkkopdeju0j1hsbi.jpg\"><em>Blackpool beach in December</em></p>\n<p>Regarding Manchester, living costs are about double what they are in Blackpool, so still fairly cheap. If the hotel idea proves popular, and there are people who would live at something like that in Manchester, but not in Blackpool, then it may be worth a try doing something similar in Manchester. London is probably double the costs again, so at that point the bar is significantly higher in terms of paying for living costs being positive EV when compared with donations to highly effective charities. Assuming most people working at highly effective charities have similar \u201cbig city\u201d living costs, it\u2019s then more of a level playing field in terms of \u201cis this EA producing as much value on a day to day basis as someone working at a highly effective EA charity\u201d (although you can take off the charity\u2019s overheads in terms of employing someone, and employment taxes. More on this in the <a href=\"#section6\">Value Proposition</a> section).</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>The Hotel Manager</h1>\n<p>The Hotel Manager role is suited to someone who\u2019s happiest when assisting others in achieving as much good as possible; someone who\u2019s interested in playing a vital role on an important mission. &nbsp;If the project is successful, it will become a high impact position.</p>\n<p>The Manager will live on site and deal with all the admin, finances, shopping, cooking, dishwashing, cleaning, laundry, socials, events and morale - they will also have free living expenses, and be paid a modest salary (\u00a320,000/year<a href=\"#ftnt6\">[6]</a>). Ideally they will be a competent cook. All the cooking, cleaning and laundry for 17+ people is too much for one person to take on in addition to management tasks, so part time staff and external services will be hired to to do some of these tasks. The laundering of bed linen and towels is contracted out to a service that costs ~\u00a32/guest/week (which is economical when compared with hiring staff to do it and managing them). Cleaning will be done by external contractors on weekends. Perhaps one or two guests could volunteer to help out in the kitchen for the evening meal (breakfast will be a simple buffet of cereal, toast, and fruit most days, perhaps a cooked breakfast at the weekend; and lunch will be salads, DIY sandwiches, crisps, fruit and other snacks, and leftovers from dinner the night before.) With part time staff and some small amount of volunteering and self-service amongst guests, there should be enough slack in the system for the Hotel Manager to have weekends off and a standard five weeks of holiday per year. One or two guests can also be paid to take on critical roles if necessary when the manager is away.</p>\n<p>When the hotel was at full capacity in the heydays of the 1980s, there were four or five staff. However, most of the work was restaurant related. Having serve-yourself buffet breakfasts and lunches, and a choice of say two options for each dinner, makes the food preparation a lot easier when compared to an average hotel that has many options on the menu and is making meals individually or in small batches to order. So the job will not be on the level of full time chef and full time hotel manager in one. All necessary training, such as attending food hygiene and licensed bar management courses will be provided (the bar will probably only be open one night a week).</p>\n<p>Ideally, it will be good to have the Hotel Manager start as soon as possible<a href=\"#ftnt7\">[7]</a>, so they can help get the hotel fixed up (some amount of repairs need doing) and meeting regulations (make sure all safety certificates and licenses are in order). There is also work to be done in setting up the organisational structure - a Charitable Incorporated Organisation, for which trustees need to be found<a href=\"#ftnt7a\">[7a]</a>, a charter written, and incorporation documents filed (see <a href=\"#section7\">Sustainability, risks and organisation</a> section below) - and getting it in a position to sponsor visas for overseas guests. And backend systems for admin, like a website, booking system and accounts spreadsheets need to be built.</p>\n<p>The role of Hotel Manager will require a highly motivated self-starter with a generalist skillset and good people skills. Hiring a competent manager could end up as a \u201cchicken and egg\u201d situation, whereby the project might need to be successful already in order to attract the necessary talent. I have hopes that someone from within the EA movement who sees the potential in the project can be found though. In the event that there is no one suitable candidate, the role could be split into two part time roles, perhaps along the lines of having a public facing \u201ccommunity manager\u201d and a back room \u201coperations manager\u201d.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Other uses for the hotel</h1>\n<p>With two large common rooms - the bar and the dining room - and a smaller lounge, the hotel is also well-suited to hosting workshops, conferences, and research retreats, such as the <a href=\"http://aisafety.camp/about-the-camps/\">AI Safety Camp</a>, or rationality workshops. Maybe even coding bootcamps. The bar has seating for 40 people, the dining room 32, and the lounge 12. I'd say the hotel should be comfortable up to about 35 day-time participants at a workshop/conference, and 70-100 for a party. These could be run at very low cost, with the infrastructure already in place. Of course, if the hotel is full with residents, alternative accommodation will need to be supplied for some (or all) of the event guests. It should be fairly easy to have excess guests stay in nearby B&amp;Bs if need be - the immediate area (within 50m) is full of them, and the prices are generally quite low (and the amount of excess capacity high). And even if the hotel is hosting an event, it should still be possible to feed the non-attending guests at mealtimes too if people sit in both the dining room and the bar.</p>\n<p>The hotel was advertised as 18 bedrooms, but there are in fact 17 as there is no number 13!<a href=\"#ftnt8\">[8]</a> There are also three rooms in the basement, and two in the attic, but these do not meet regulations so are for storage/occasional/emergency use (I - and/or other Trustees<a href=\"#ftnt9\">[9]</a> - can stay in the attic if the hotel is otherwise full, and the basement can be the nuclear bunker). Most of the rooms are double or twin rooms, with a few singles and triples (\"family\" rooms); 35 people could stay in total if the hotel is filled to its current bed capacity with most people sharing (see \u201cRooms\u201d sheet <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bTwMRAD4TQjvHZ0eRCsN4uFdN5Se4zdcP1ikFOKj6-4/edit#gid=777184748\">here</a>). Even more could stay were some of the larger rooms made into 4- or 6-bed dorm rooms with the addition of bunkbeds. In this scenario, there are still more than enough bathrooms (12 rooms have en suite shower rooms, and there is a stand alone shower on each floor).</p>\n<p>In order to help keep the hotel both well occupied and on a good financial footing, rooms could also be offered for rent to visitors from the EA community who may or may not be working on important things during their stay. People pledging to do EA work will have precedence (and of those, people requiring a free stay). More on this in the following \u201cValue proposition\u201d section.</p>\n<p>Another idea for empty rooms is offering outsiders the chance to purchase a kind of \u201ccatastrophic risk insurance\u201d; paying, say, \u00a31/day to reserve the right to live at the hotel in the event of a global (or regional) catastrophe. When they make it to the hotel, they would then pay their share of the costs of living<a href=\"#ftnt10\">[10]</a>. In the case of a nuclear exchange elsewhere in the world, people may want to leave big cities like London, and move to stay in a safer place with known allies. They would be paying to reserve their right to do so. Also, growing the EA community in Northern England in general could be seen as a hedge against x-risk, i.e lessen the number of eggs (EAs) in the same, higher risk baskets (London and the South East). Blackpool might be hard to get to in the event of a catastrophe, but the flip side of this is that there would be a lower risk from hostile actors (mercenaries, milita), as well as lower direct damage from nukes and fallout. However, as a safe house it has the disadvantage of it\u2019s address being public knowledge.</p>\n<p>The cellars could serve as a nuclear bunker of moderate protection. It will be relatively low cost to keep a stockpile of long lasting food down there, which could be slowly used and replenished by the kitchen over a 2-5 year cycle. There is already bathroom plumbing down there, and other essentials could be easily <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/819504268212156/\">added</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Value proposition</h1>\n<p>In terms of a value proposition, it will be hard to assign quantitative value to the outputs of this project with any precision. It\u2019s essentially speculative investing in the EA potential of the guests. There will be compounding effects from those who successfully \u201clevel up\u201d in their abilities (such as study and research), and from the work they produce. Future effects of the work done will also have a high variance, and involve many unknowns. This is essentially a form of \u201c<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/hits-based-giving\">hits based giving</a>\u201d. And as with any hits based giving, the baseline that it has to beat is using the same resources on relatively well quantified low-risk interventions, such as those promoted by GiveWell. In this case \u00a35700<a href=\"#ftnt11\">[11]</a>/guest/year donated to the most effective charity, plus the opportunity cost of what guests would otherwise be doing, which presumably would be fairly low in the situation where staying at the hotel is the best option. Although perhaps the opportunity cost could be of the same order - a couple of thousand pounds a year given to EA charities (10% of a median salary). Again, as with all \u201chits based\u201d things, it\u2019ll only take one major success for the whole project to be worthwhile.</p>\n<p>If there is not enough demand from EAs wanting to stay for free to fill the hotel, empty rooms could be filled with paying guests to help cover costs. People paying cost price (~\u00a3210-700/person/month, dependent on occupancy, see <a href=\"#section9\">budget</a>) would keep costs the same regardless of number of paying and free guests. People paying more would reduce the cost of hosting guests for free. In the event of empty rooms being available, EAs would be welcome to stay and pay cost price, whether working or not, in order to boost community; people not committing to EA stuff are welcome to stay and pay at a markup. In the case of half the guests paying at a markup and half being hosted for free, costs for hosting the free guests would be reduced by the markup. As an example, assuming all 16 guest bedrooms are filled by a single occupant, cost price (excluding stipend) is \u00a3330/month per guest. In the case of eight free/cost price guests, and eight guests paying at a 50% markup, costs will be \u00a3165/month per free guest, or \u00a33500/year factoring in the \u00a330/week stipend. At the extreme, charging a 100% markup + \u00a330/week (\u00a3825/month<a href=\"#_ftn11\">[11]</a>) for half the rooms would make the hotel revenue neutral, and there would be zero cost for hosting eight free EA guests and the Hotel Manager. This (\u00a3780/month) compares favourably to market rates of between <a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=hotels%20blackpool&amp;npsic=0&amp;rflfq=1&amp;rlha=1&amp;rlla=0&amp;rlhsc=CiEI3ZL6u_jyp8KoAQiNktPYyOv-ksgBCNT3o9zD6fXT3wE&amp;rllag=53830700,-3054711,382&amp;tbm=lcl&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-9K63p5LZAhUHIcAKHa95DOkQtgMILw&amp;hotel_dates=2018-02-25,2018-02-26&amp;tbs=lf_hd:-1,lf_ho:1,lrf:!1m4!1u13!2m2!13m1!1b1!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e4!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e5!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e9!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e8!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e10!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e2!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e1!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e3!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e7!2m21!1e7!4m4!7m3!1m1!1u75!3sGBP!4m4!7m3!1m1!1u100!3sGBP!4m4!7m3!1m1!1u125!3sGBP!4m4!7m3!1m1!1u150!3sGBP!2m1!1e2!2m1!1e19!2m1!1e4!2m1!1e13!2m28!1e10!4m2!11m1!1e4!4m2!11m1!1e5!4m2!11m1!1e9!4m2!11m1!1e8!4m2!11m1!1e10!4m2!11m1!1e2!4m2!11m1!1e1!4m2!11m1!1e3!4m2!11m1!1e7!2m7!1e17!4m2!17m1!1e3!4m2!17m1!1e8!3sIAE,lf:1,lf_ui:6&amp;rldoc=1&amp;fll=53.810353457280975,-3.0529675691677767&amp;fspn=0.0035855863356033524,0.010943432440915224&amp;fz=17&amp;sll=53.810353457280975,-3.0529675691677767&amp;sspn=0.0035855863356033524,0.010943432440915224&amp;sz=17&amp;rlfi=hd:2018-02-25,2018-02-26;si:&amp;qop=0#qop=0&amp;rlfi=hd:2018-02-25,2018-02-26;si:;mv:!1m3!1d38172.31062102612!2d-3.0337117!3d53.82322445!2m3!1f0!2f0!3f0!3m2!1i149!2i389!4f13.1;tbs:lf_hd:-1,lf_ho:1,lrf:!1m4!1u13!2m2!13m1!1b1!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e4!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e5!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e9!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e8!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e10!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e2!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e1!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e3!1m4!1u10!2m2!11m1!1e7!2m21!1e7!4m4!7m3!1m1!1u75!3sGBP!4m4!7m3!1m1!1u100!3sGBP!4m4!7m3!1m1!1u125!3sGBP!4m4!7m3!1m1!1u150!3sGBP!2m1!1e2!2m1!1e19!2m1!1e4!2m1!1e13!2m28!1e10!4m2!11m1!1e4!4m2!11m1!1e5!4m2!11m1!1e9!4m2!11m1!1e8!4m2!11m1!1e10!4m2!11m1!1e2!4m2!11m1!1e1!4m2!11m1!1e3!4m2!11m1!1e7!2m7!1e17!4m2!17m1!1e3!4m2!17m1!1e8!3sIAE,lf:1,lf_ui:6\">\u00a315 and \u00a360 a night for hotels</a> and similar for <a href=\"https://www.airbnb.co.uk/s/Blackpool--United-Kingdom/homes?checkin=2018-06-16&amp;checkout=2018-06-17&amp;adults=1&amp;children=0&amp;infants=0&amp;source=mc_search_bar&amp;refinement_paths%5B%5D=%2Fhomes&amp;allow_override%5B%5D=&amp;ib=true&amp;ne_lat=53.83798571825633&amp;ne_lng=-2.939498134594942&amp;sw_lat=53.74154954980646&amp;sw_lng=-3.0939933738527543&amp;zoom=12&amp;search_by_map=true&amp;room_types%5B%5D=Private%20room&amp;s_tag=fTwa57Xa\">Airbnbs</a>, especially considering those prices don\u2019t include food. There may be scope to roll this out as a sustainable (non-profit) business model for EA hotels around the world.</p>\n<p>Factoring in shorter stays with gaps, the average yield from rooms with paying guests would be reduced, so even with half the rooms set aside for paying guests, if charging a 50% markup, costs for the free guests might realistically be reduced by 10-35%. Costs could perhaps be further offset by charging for meals separately at a higher markup. Perhaps \u00a32.50 for breakfast, \u00a32.50 for lunch, and \u00a35 for dinner, v.s. \u00a32.75/day cost price for food. Separating out the room and board costs might lead to more people eating out though, and overall less revenue coming in.</p>\n<p>For many guests, it is anticipated that the hotel will act as a stepping stone to bigger things. A free stay of up to two years should be sufficient to complete a large enough amount of work to enable good future opportunities; ones that would have not been readily available otherwise, be they jobs at EA organisations earned after studying relevant fields, or investment opportunities earned after the creation of a successful start up. The rationale for having two years as a default timescale is that it\u2019s long enough to get deep into work, without having to plan next moves for a while, but not so long as to overly encourage freeloading or dependence. However, in exceptional circumstances the limit will be open to being extended (say a major piece of work is not quite finished, or high value independent research is being continually produced).</p>\n<p>In order to help maximise the flourishing of guests\u2019 potential, having an additional member of staff as a full time morale officer/mentor/work coordinator could well be worth it, not only for the guests themselves, but in terms of potential payoff in value created.</p>\n<p>Some of you may be thinking: instead of going to all the trouble buying a hotel and starting a new organisation, why not just give people the money instead? Well, for it to be equivalent, they would have to be living (or go to live) somewhere where the costs of living are comparable, otherwise I would effectively be buying them time at a much higher cost. For example, someone frugal living in London might be able to get by on \u00a315,000 a year. So for the same costs they would get about a third of the time; and this is before factoring in the free time-saving services (cooking, laundry, cleaning etc). So unless they were ~4x as productive as the average hotel guest, this would be a bad deal for me as a donor<a href=\"#ftnt12\">[12]</a>. Also, the community aspect of having a significant number of EAs in the same place is probably worth something too in terms of increased focus, collaboration and morale boosting productivity. Community building via deeper in-person ties is becoming increasingly important to the further development of the EA movement (see<a href=\"/ea/1k6/the_almighty_hive_will/\"> here</a> and <a href=\"/ea/1g5/effective_altruism_london_strategic_plan_funding/\">here</a>).</p>\n<p>If people were to live somewhere like South-East Asia, they could probably get the equivalent bang for their buck in terms of living expenses. In fact, I know of a few EAs who are doing this already. To be consistent I, or the organisation this becomes, should also offer grants for budding EA digital nomads. It will be even better if a group of digital nomads formed a hub so there was some kind of focal point for people wanting to do this.</p>\n<p>When CEA was starting out, they managed group houses in Oxford for their workers and volunteers. After a while, once Oxford was more established as an EA hub, they decided it best to free up their valuable time and let their staff self-organise their own accommodation and shared houses. The same model could be applied for EAs forming hubs in cheap locations. Perhaps this project could act as an initial focal point, and manage initial accommodation in each location. Maybe the umbrella organisation could be called \u201cEA Hotels and Low-cost Living\u201d?</p>\n<p>For consistency, grants should be given in general to any EA whose living costs are low enough. Would this cause perverse incentives though? All else being equal, it\u2019s much better to give promising people an <a href=\"http://thielfellowship.org/\">amount</a> that allows them a lot of freedom and <a href=\"https://thezvi.wordpress.com/2017/09/30/slack/\">slack</a>. However, this makes the value proposition proportionally lower. Providing grants only at low levels of living costs is a better investment for the donor, but it also leaves a gap for people who don\u2019t want to - or aren\u2019t in a position to - radically alter their lifestyles but still need their living costs covered in order to do (more) useful EA things. Given that EA (as a movement) seems to have plenty of cash at the moment, perhaps there is room for this space to grow. I can envisage a hierarchy where the bigger grants have more stringent demands and more competition. I guess this is just the current non-profit (and for profit!) landscape, but for individuals instead of organisations. There are already many such grants in the forms of prizes and scholarships at the high end, but not much at the low end, so this is perhaps where the opportunity is.</p>\n<p>There has been some <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/1722174211172262/\">debate</a> recently about funding people/projects at the low end and whether donors are being too risk averse. I think we\u2019re probably at the point where there are more false negatives than false positives, so more chances can be taken on people at the low end. Scammers can be avoided, at least in the first instance, by requiring a prior history of involvement in EA and references from people with standing in the community. The bigger risk is well intentioned but ineffective grant recipients (/hotel guests) just not delivering. However, we are likely already in a situation where EAs frequently go off on their own to work on individual projects that don\u2019t deliver, but we don't hear much about it because of selection effects/social desirability bias (though there are <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/kAgJJa3HLSZxsuSrf/arbital-postmortem\">welcome</a> <a href=\"/ea/1oq/ineffective_entrepreneurship_postmortem_of_hippo/\">exceptions</a> that come to mind<a href=\"#ftnt13\">[13]</a>). The hotel scheme makes this more transparent if it is indeed occurring, and it gives us a testbed to try out interventions (H/T John Maxwell). Such failure to deliver will be mitigated by the low costs involved (meaning that there is a lower bar to what level of productivity could be considered effective), but is nevertheless something to keep in mind.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s worth noting that in a situation where a potential investment has high risk, but also has high upside potential, the answer to the question of how much to invest is often \u201c<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/MajyZJrsf8fAywWgY/a-lesswrong-crypto-autopsy\">a small amount</a>\u201d as opposed to \u201czero\u201d (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_mugging\">Pascal\u2019s mugging</a> does not apply when there aren\u2019t that many similar opportunities, and certainly not enough to come close to draining all your capital. This is certainly the case with the current EA movement<a href=\"#ftnt14\">[14]</a>). &nbsp;There is also still the risk of \u201cideological nepotism\u201d (\u201crewarding people solely for ascribing to the right values and knowing the right memes\u201d) (H/T David Krueger) to contend with. To a certain extent this plays a role in any community that has shared beliefs and culture; nevertheless, being aware of it should help reduce it. The dynamics of status and prestige in the non-profit world seem to be geared toward being averse to risk-of-failure to a much greater extent than in the for-profit world (see e.g. <a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/inequality.html#f1n\">the high rate of failure for VC funded start-ups</a>). Perhaps we need to close this gap, considering that the bottom line results of EA activity are often considered in terms expected utility.</p>\n<p>In line with the \"hits-based giving\" angle, there are large potential upsides to this project. If the project is successful and hotel residents are able to generate value in a way that's clear to other EAs, then we've got a workable pilot for decreasing EA living expenses by a large factor, meaning donor dollars can go that much further. There are also huge potential upsides in terms of community building (imagine a year-round EA Global), funding projects that are less <a href=\"https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2010/07/26/a-big-little-idea-called-legibility/\">legible</a> to donors, and deploying donor dollars in a way that reduces perverse incentives (the possibility of perverse incentives might be a large part of what\u2019s holding back EAs from giving money to each other) (H/T John Maxwell).</p>\n<p>Why a Hotel? Hotels offer a high standard of living (catering, cleaning, laundry services), and are efficient in terms of resource use (catering for many people at once, buying in bulk<a href=\"#ftnt15\">[15]</a>). Whilst normally associated with holidays, they actually can be viewed as enabling high productivity in general - whether that is a high productivity of leisure, or <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/neilpatel/2016/12/22/why-i-only-stay-at-5-star-hotels\">work</a>. <a href=\"http://www.rosehotel.net/blog/article/15-reasons-why-people-choose-to-live-in-hotels\">This list</a> describes the benefits, although obviously the Blackpool EA Hotel will not include everything on it. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel#Long_term_residence\">Here</a> is a list of notable people who have lived in hotels, and <a href=\"https://www.express.co.uk/news/weird/369530/The-hotel-guests-who-never-check-out\">some</a> <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/hotels/articles/celebrities-who-have-lived-in-hotels/\">discussion</a>. Quite apart from matters of efficient living, there is a certain romanticism about the idea of living in a hotel, evocative of mid-20th century cinema. The EA Hotel: Blackpool will be at the low end, but may inspire other projects that take it to another level (see x-risk hub discussion below).</p>\n<p>Having a set-up where there is plenty of communal space, but also private rooms for working, gives the best of both worlds in terms of deep solo work and serendipitous collaboration, as illustrated in Cal Newport\u2019s <a href=\"https://medium.com/@GrandCentralPub/excerpted-from-deep-work-by-cal-newport-f58adfb24fd0\">hub-and-spoke</a> model.</p>\n<p>Other options for low cost living include large shared houses, and converted warehouses. Some houses with many bedrooms in Blackpool have similar low costs per bedroom as the cheap hotels; see <a href=\"http://www.rightmove.co.uk/property-for-sale/find.html?locationIdentifier=REGION%5E168&amp;minBedrooms=5&amp;maxPrice=150000&amp;sortType=1&amp;includeSSTC=false\">this list</a> from a popular property website (it was searching on this website with a wide range and sorting by price low-to-high, and reading about the Chelsea Hotel, that gave me this idea. Along with initial priming from <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/664817953593844/permalink/1251242324951401/\">research into hotels for communal living by John Beshir</a>). Large shared houses can benefit from economies of scale if tenants are highly communal in their shopping and cooking. Without explicit organisation from the outset, it is generally rare for such high levels of coordination to happen though (I have not lived in a shared house where it has, despite the best intentions of many housemates in several houses). Converted warehouses are similar to large shared houses, but have the potential advantage of significantly lower rents. There are buildings in the Blackpool area where it might be possible (given planning permission) to make rooms for perhaps as low as \u00a33000/room (compared to \u00a37500/room for the hotel). However, already once you are getting as low as \u00a37500/room, effective rent costs start to become a small fraction of living costs (&lt;20% See <a href=\"#section9\">budget</a>), so even reducing them to zero can only help so much.</p>\n<p>Living costs in a shared house could be lower still than the hotel, but not by much more than approximately 35%, which is the fraction of the above costs taken up by staff wages (Staff costs are approx \u00a330k out of an \u00a387k annual budget<a href=\"#ftnt16\">[16]</a>). So perhaps \u00a33500/year. Going down to absolute minimum levels of food spending (\u00a31/day is possible with bread and margarine, peanut butter, porridge, bananas, carrots and rice), costs could perhaps be as low as \u00a32800 a year. EAs who want more independent living can form group houses nearby, which would be open to being funded by this project. Of course living in a shared house and doing all meals and cleaning yourself might reduce productive EA hours by a few a week, so funding would probably be given at a slightly reduced rate compared to the hotel to factor this in.</p>\n<p>I haven\u2019t found many good examples of already existing projects that are similar to this one. <a href=\"https://www.nwspk.com/\">Newspeak House</a> in London provides fellowships to people who share a common cause (political technologists focusing on digital democracy); whilst fellows have accommodation provided, they largely need to provide for themselves. Historically, there has been the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hotel_Chelsea\">Chelsea Hotel</a>. There has been much discussion in the EA community of <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/664817953593844/\">housing projects</a>, and <a href=\"https://arbital.com/p/accelerator_project/\">forming new</a> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/227450274352602/\">(low cost) hubs</a>, but thus far, progress has been relatively slow, with a few group houses with EA, or part-EA missions coming to fruition (<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/crowsnestrationality/\">e.</a><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/macroscopers/\">g.</a>). The hard part of all projects of this kind is getting people to actually move!<a href=\"#ftnt17\">[17]</a> In the adjacent rationalist community there are many more group houses, many with a proportion of EA residents. No real low cost hubs have formed as of yet though.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995140/mirroredImages/JdqHvyy2Tjcj3nKoD/twmjvzdckfrfuwv0lmkp.jpg\"><em>Blackpool Tower and tramlines along the Promenade</em></p>\n<p>X-risk focused EAs in the Geneva area have under consideration, as part of a wider <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zSyRV-wfpIUoeff1fAUxLu-qo6DO1lh0Ighg1sB-RMU\">strategy</a>, an x-risk <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QM1C6EYLCZZPUXpk6y3yu36c9pkDlzR227K_P1_eELU/edit#slide=id.g1f56c26561_0_160\">hub</a>, that would both be a focal point for discussion of x-risk with wider society (plugged in to the global diplomacy scene there), and an incubator for new talent. The grand vision is for something much larger and more luxurious; a large complex for 100+ residents with games room, music room, sports facilities, kids play area etc (although it would have apartments rather than a hotel format). It would provide a pipeline for talent to level up and move on to working at x-risk orgs, as well as hosting its own x-risk org focused on global coordination and implementing the fruits of research. This might sound like a rather extravagant use of EA funding, but given the nature of x-risk the return in expected value could easily be well worth it (concerns about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_mugging\">Pascal\u2019s mugging</a> <a href=\"/ea/qw/saying_ai_safety_research_is_a_pascals_mugging/\">notwithstanding</a>). Also, given that OpenPhil are likely to spend a lot more on x-risk in the <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/our-progress-2017-and-plans-2018#Plans_for_2018\">near future</a>, it is a distinct possibility that something like this could get funded. Although to be clear, the people behind this 100+ resident x-risk hub idea feel that there is insufficient evidence to justify dedicating resources to move ahead with the project at this time.</p>\n<p>The Blackpool EA Hotel could serve as a useful test bed for such a larger hub (if successful, it could increase the chances of something like the Geneva x-risk hub getting funding). With a low cost hub and a high cost hub, there could be a progression of people levelling up at the hotel, to enrolling in a structured intern program at the Geneva hub, to researching and implementing things at the forefront in Geneva, or going on to <a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/\">FHI</a>, <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/\">MIRI</a>, <a href=\"https://www.cser.ac.uk/\">CSER</a> etc)<a href=\"#ftnt18\">[18]</a>.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Sustainability, risks and organisation</h1>\n<p>Currently this project has funding for the first year of operations (and the hotel has already been bought and paid for). Assuming the cryptocurrency markets maintain at least a third of their current value<a href=\"#ftnt19\">[19]</a> going forward, the next few years are also covered. For longer term sustainability it is desirable for funding to be covered by more than one person, not least due to the greater stability and accountability resultant from having multiple financial stakeholders. To this end, it makes sense to run the hotel as a non-profit charitable organisation. Given the business-like nature of a hotel, a foundation Charitable Incorporated Organisation (CIO) is the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/charity-types-how-to-choose-a-structure\">best option</a> (this is a corporate body where the only members are the trustees). This has an added benefit of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/donating-to-charity/gift-aid\">saving having to pay tax on the capital gains used for funding the project</a> (I bought the hotel with my capital gains and plan on <a href=\"https://www.institute-of-fundraising.org.uk/guidance/fundraising-essentials-legislation/tax-effective-giving/land-and-property/land-and-property-for-charities/\">gifting it to the CIO</a>).</p>\n<p>Best practice says that CIO's should have a minimum of three Trustees. Anyone interested in being a Trustee? My initial thought was that in order to avoid conflict of interest, Trustees should not be guests staying for free, or the manager. But perhaps that will lead the governance of the CIO to be <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/voluntary-sector-network/2016/apr/19/charity-chief-executives-board-trustees\">out of touch</a>. Better organisation might result if the Manager, and a representative of the guests, are both on the Board of Trustees. Perhaps then add two independents for balance. So the board would be five - me (as Founder), the Manager (as day-to-day organiser), the EA Guest Rep (relaying the guest experience first hand, and two independent Trustees (for an outside perspective).</p>\n<p>Once the organisation is set up, people who think investing in EAs at ~\u00a35.4k/year will produce more value than the same given to top EA charities will be free to donate to it. Options to sponsor individual stays can also be provided. To give non-fee-paying guests (FreEAs?) security and peace of mind that the rug won\u2019t be pulled from under them, there will be a contractual obligation provided by the hotel to provide them with accommodation and food. On the part of the non-fee-paying guests there will be a counterpart to this obligation of abiding by the Code of Conduct<a href=\"#ftnt20\">[20]</a>, and pledging to work on EA things. Acceptance of long-term (over a month) non-fee-paying guests, and events, will be subject to at least four of five trustees agreeing, including the EA Guest Rep and Manager. Short-term (less than a month) non-fee-paying guests will be accepted at the discretion of the Manager (I am the de facto manager until the full-time salaried position is filled).</p>\n<p>In terms of overall productivity, it will probably be best to limit the hotel solely to free EA places. However, In the event of empty rooms, it might be good to encourage donors and other promoters of the project to pay for rooms and stay at the hotel, for community building purposes. In general however, the emphasis will be on filling as many rooms as possible with EA guests working on important things and paying nothing (the goal of the project is hosting such people!). Allocating rooms to paying guests at the expense of such free guests will only be done if it becomes a necessity for the fiscal health of the project (say if reserves drop below 12 months\u2019 runway). But in the extreme, charging a 100% markup on cost price - plus and additional \u00a330/week to cover stipends - for half the rooms would make the hotel revenue neutral, and there would be zero cost for hosting eight free EA guests and the Hotel Manager.</p>\n<p>Regarding the stipend, is \u00a330/week enough for phone, laptop, clothes, travel, entertainment, and all other non-food-or-housing expenditure? It seems so with the calculations done in the <a href=\"#section9\">budget</a>, but perhaps there could be a system where people can request additional funds for emergencies. Also a separate \u201ccareer progression\u201d fund could be useful for people to attend key conferences likely to help further their work (these funds being separate so as not to increase baseline costs of living at the hotel).</p>\n<p>Alumni will be welcome to give back if the hotel serves them well in their endeavours. Perhaps a start-up launched from the hotel might give some equity, which in future becomes worth a lot. This would be analogous to painters giving paintings to the Chelsea Hotel before they became famous, and then the paintings becoming worth millions.</p>\n<p>What would the cost of failure of this project be? Conservatively, perhaps selling the hotel at a 15% loss (\u00a320k), and six months of running costs (&lt;\u00a333k (<a href=\"#section9\">budget</a>) assuming no more than half occupancy if it\u2019s failing). Round to \u00a350k. Plus, say 250 hours of my time, and the time spent by the hotel staff and volunteers. This would need counterfactual adjustment though, which given that the project is high expected value to begin with, could perhaps be largely depreciated. Financially, one way of looking at this is that it\u2019s no more than a bad trade on the crypto markets, of which I made more than one of similar magnitude in the process of making the money to fund this project (I made others that were of much larger magnitude in the opposite direction though!) In fact, even selling the ETH to fund the purchase of the hotel was in hindsight not ideal, given that I could\u2019ve got double the money if I\u2019d waited three weeks! Such \u201cwhat if\u201ds are neither here nor there though. \u00a350k is still a lot of cash that could be spent on a lot of other good EA projects (or more established giving opportunities). This perhaps behooves more analysis for this project. Then again, it\u2019s sometimes good to just try things and avoid analysis paralysis. Perhaps a happy medium could be struck though - anyone want to make a <a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/\">Guesstimate</a> model? Funding is available to do so.</p>\n<p>What is the risk of failure? Even at 50%, the downside (~\u00a350k + counterfactual time) is much more limited than the upside, so it seems like something that should be done. And The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Value_of_information\">Value of Information</a> is high.</p>\n<p>A Facebook <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1624791014242988/permalink/1743833072338781/\">poll</a> shows 1-3 month stays as the most popular options. However, the most benefit might perhaps be provided to those that stay over a longer term, i.e. 12-24 months. People staying shorter times might well be more likely to have counterfactually managed to work on the same stuff elsewhere, without the free living provided by the hotel.</p>\n<p>Antisocial behaviour and petty crime are issues in Blackpool, but hopefully this won\u2019t be too much of an issue for hotel guests if they stick together when out at night. Statistically, it\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.police.uk/greater-manchester/EC22/performance/compare-your-area\">no worse than Manchester</a>, and I have been fine so far living there. Given the public nature of a hotel, people <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/664817953593844/permalink/1621550301253933/\">not content with having their address readily discoverable</a> should probably not stay at the hotel (at least not long term).</p>\n<p>The Hotel Manager will need to make sure that hotel does not fall foul of any of the many <a href=\"https://www.assetsure.com/business/hotel-insurance/hotels-laws/\">regulations</a> that apply. Failing in this regard could have significant consequences, and in a worse case scenario lead to the hotel being shut down, and/or sued. The stairs (and some floors) are a bit crooked from some historic subsidence. This will either need to be fixed (probably overly costly), or perhaps guests can sign a disclaimer accepting the (minimal) risk of using them (the lean is about 5 degrees, so it feels a little like being on a ship initially. One quickly gets used to it though).</p>\n<p>For guests coming from outside the EU (or even inside soon, given Brexit), there will be the issue of visas. It should be possible to get a Tier 5 (Temporary Worker - Charity Worker) visa for up to 12 months if the guest is <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/tier-5-temporary-worker-charity-worker-visa\">sponsored by the CIO</a>. The CIO will first need to <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/672691/Appendix_A_01-2018_v1.0.pdf\">apply to become a sponsor</a>.</p>\n<p>What about the name and branding of the hotel? Something straight forward like \"The EA Hotel\u201d, or \u201cThe EA Hotel: Blackpool\u201d? Or maybe \"The Bentham Hotel\u201d? Or something with more in-group appeal? \u201cThe Phoenix\u2019 Nest\u201d (H/T Ryan Christopher Augustine Thomas) has associations with incubation, <a href=\"http://www.hpmor.com/\">HPMoR</a>, altruism, immortality, and also the english pub aesthetic, and the trope of adventurers meeting at an inn. However, explicitly associating it with EA might not be ideal when factoring reputational concerns; given that the initial funding source comes from risky crypto investments, and the possibility of a failure to deliver in terms of impact. A recent <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1624791014242988/permalink/1719147131474042/\">poll</a> on the Facebook group for this project now has \u201cThe EA Hotel: Blackpool\u201d in second place, with \u201cAthena\u201d Hotel (what it's currently called) in the lead. This suggests a community preference for straight forward naming, and some caution around attaching the moniker \u201cEA\u201d to projects.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995139/mirroredImages/JdqHvyy2Tjcj3nKoD/pyvrzupksx7443uned5u.png\"><em>The hotel, with view of Blackpool Tower around the corner.</em></p>\n<p>Perhaps the name could be kept as it is, but the logo could have the \u201cE\u201d and the second \u201cA\u201d of \"Athena\" a different colour (EA turquoise?). Something like this:<br><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995139/mirroredImages/JdqHvyy2Tjcj3nKoD/ruodwhivxyppw5egblsz.png\">or this:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995139/mirroredImages/JdqHvyy2Tjcj3nKoD/ttapaj147ust5bpzqnir.png\"></p>\n<p>There is a danger if the community is too insular and inward looking that it will develop unhealthy \u201ccult-like\u201d tendencies. This should be mitigated by having a regular influx of temporary visitors from within EA (and occasionally from outside EA).</p>\n<p>As with any project that involves moving to a new city, getting people to commit to move, and then actually follow through and move, is the hard part. There have been over 30 people expressing interest <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1624791014242988/permalink/1743833072338781/\">so far</a>, but ideally there needs to be another 3-5x this amount to ensure the hotel is well populated. For some, the top consideration is who they will be living with; for them, it will be a case of seeing how the hotel is populated before deciding on moving.</p>\n<p>In order to mitigate the risk of hiring an unsuitable manager and then being stuck with them, the job will involve a six month trial period to begin with. The job will also not continue after this amount of time if the hotel proves to be unviable in terms of not attracting enough guests. If there aren\u2019t many guests, the manager can use their working time to focus on developing the wider idea of \u201cEA Hotels and Low-cost Living\u201d (which may lead to a continuation of the job in other circumstances).</p>\n<p>For the hotel to be successful, the atmosphere needs to be inviting. To a large part this will be determined by the guests and how well they get on with each other. Also important is the quality of the projects that guests are involved with. Potential new guests will be more likely to join the higher the palpable sense of excitement is regarding the people they will be living with, and they projects they are working on. For example, a strong group of people studying/researching AI Safety should attract others with high potential for AI Safety work. To some extent this is a bit of a chicken and egg situation, but this can be overcome if a strong initial group is committed to moving at the start. Perhaps a pledge where people commit in groups to move could help. Also hosting workshops whereby participants would be welcome to stay on at the hotel afterward for free.</p>\n<p>Mental health is an important issue to address. Perhaps there is an increased risk that guests will suffer from mental ill health, correlated with the circumstances they find themselves in (i.e. being in need of funding and/or community), or perhaps the wider community suffers disproportionately in treading the \u201cfine line between genius and insanity\u201d. Fostering a strong sense of community, camaraderie and mutual support should help. And as previously mentioned, a case could be made for hiring a full time counsellor.</p>\n<p>For funding people\u2019s living costs elsewhere to the hotel (e.g. South-East Asia), there would be the issue of verifying whether they are actually spending that amount/year, and aren\u2019t spending more, so doing less work with the grant - i.e. if they are getting funding at \u00a35k/yr to live but are spending \u00a310k, then the \u00a35k is effectively only funding half as much time. To some extent this will have to rely on trust. Otherwise, perhaps bank statements and receipts would need to be collected, but this would both add admin costs and be a potential violation of privacy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1>Next Steps</h1>\n<p><strong>UPDATE 09 August 2018: The website is now up at <a href=\"https://eahotel.org\">eahotel.org</a>.

This would complement the EA Grants program, and would be valuable to people who literally don\u2019t have the time or energy to formally apply for funding. I think it would have a good chance of being highly cost effective.

Included are sheets showing fixed costs and variable costs. Variable costs depend on the occupancy of the hotel - the number of guests can be edited at the top left. Note that all the figures that are inputs to the calculations are highlighted in yellow; to play around with the numbers, please request access and make a copy of the sheet. Figures quoted in the main text assume an occupancy of 16 people (one person per bedroom, excluding the Hotel Manager). \u00a35700/person/year is arrived at with all rooms filled by a single person. If people were to share, filling the hotel to its capacity of 35 people would result in costs of ~\u00a34000/person/year. These figures are without factoring in amortisation of the cost of the building; this is reasonable as the building will remain an asset which should retain value (or even increase in value if Blackpool\u2019s fortunes turn around<a href=\"#ftnt22\">[22]</a>)</p>\n<p>Examples of costed meals and stipend spending are given to show that the allowances of \u00a32.75/person/day for food and \u00a330/person/week for stipend are reasonable.

Double and triple room prices are calculated based on the fraction of their share of savings from economies of scale (see calculations on \u201cRooms\u201d sheet). Indeed, for paying guests, prices could be adjusted depending on the occupancy level of the hotel (lower prices the fuller the hotel is).</p>\n<p>Also included are time estimates for admin, cleaning and other work, and sketched out timetables for workers and guests; a table showing details of the rooms; and a list of purchases made to date.</p>", "user": {"username": "Greg_Colbourn"}}, {"_id": "xgYodA7fom4mbD6v4", "title": "Effective Thesis project review", "postedAt": "2018-05-31T18:45:22.248Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><em><span>This article was jointly written by David Janku and Jan Kulveit from the Czech EA Association.</span></em><span><br></span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Within the </span><a href=\"/ea/1ls/introducing_czech_association_for_effective/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1522957213401000\"><span>Czech EA Association</span></a><span> we have been running the </span><a href=\"http://effectivethesis.com/\"><span>Effective Thesis</span></a><span> project for almost a year now, and would like to share some more information about the project, and our future plans. </span></p>\n<p><span>For those interested in contributing, such as EA-aligned researchers, or even just anybody with a great research topic idea, please contact us at <a href=\"mailto:david.janku@efektivni-altruismus.cz\">david.janku@efektivni-altruismus.cz</a></span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3><span>Introduction</span></h3>\n<p><span>Effective Thesis is a project that directs students&#x2019; research towards EA causes by offering them EA-related topics for their final dissertations and theses. The aim is to deliver three valuable outcomes: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Changing student trajectories at a particularly crucial juncture in their lives</span></li>\n<li><span>Generating additional research in EA cause areas, with little cost to EA funding sources</span></li>\n<li><span>Making current academics (students&#x2019; supervisors and committees) more familiar with EA perspective and EA topics </span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Our hope is this could be potentially high-leverage, even more so than usual career coaching, as we are focusing on a particularly crucial juncture.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3><span>Background</span></h3>\n<p><span>In most European universities, a dissertation is a compulsory part of any bachelor&apos;s, master&#x2019;s and doctoral degrees. People spend hundreds to thousands of hours working on it (dependent on study discipline and course requirements) and refer to it as the greatest challenge and achievement in their studies. Yet, most of them experience a huge struggle when trying to find the right topic. The quality of dissertations differs very much by university, course, supervisor availability and individual students&#x2019; factors. All students also have their own supervisor advising them throughout the research process and the academic quality of the dissertation is in the end checked by a committee who reads it and decides on the mark the student receives.</span></p>\n<h3>&#xA0;</h3>\n<h3><span>Main idea</span></h3>\n<p><span>Since dissertations are compulsory for many students, they invest much time and effort into them, they have academic support in increasing the quality of their research but often struggle to find a topic, so we had an idea to utilize this process by offering students EA-related topics.</span></p>\n<p><span>To make it multiplicative, we have decided to ask EA orgs for these topics and agreed they will provide students with consultations to ensure that students&#x2019; work will be of best use to EA orgs. Consultations also serve as a motivator for students and should increase the quality of their work and, in a broader sense, should help to align academia and practice. </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>We have decided to create an online platform to make this project more scalable. We have created a </span><a href=\"http://effectivethesis.com/\"><span>website</span></a><span> where people can read about why some problems are more important than others and see the topics filtered by their study discipline and interests. For each topic profile, we have put together descriptions, explaining why the topic is important and including sources to start with when the student is interested in the topic.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3><span>Reflections on the project development</span></h3>\n<h4><span>Outcomes</span></h4>\n<p><span>We have put about 1500 hours into the project. So far, we have 12 students working on some of our topics and we estimate that each of them will invest about 200-300 hours into their theses, resulting in approx. 2400-3600 extra research hours. Up until now, the project budget was &#xA3;5400, so each trajectory change cost roughly &#xA3;450. From interviews with 2 students who have already finished their dissertations, it seems that our project helped them realize that they could do a dissertation on an EA topic and it also helped them to find sub-disciplines and specific problems to focus on within the EA problem areas. Both of them worked on AI safety problems and are now are looking for a job in this field, although the counterfactual influence of dissertation on their long-term career plans is difficult to evaluate since both of them also consulted with 80k and were in contact with other EA organizations and information sources. &#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h4><span>Marketing</span></h4>\n<p><span>Since we operate online, one of our main marketing venues was an AdGrants Google account enabling us to spend $10.000 per month on AdWords. We got together with the marketing company Brainslab </span><a href=\"/ea/1hy/would_any_ea_chapters_like_help_running_an/\"><span>who offered help to EA projects</span></a><span> and who took care of our account and increased its quality. However, after several months, it seems we still don&#x2019;t have a good way to reach the right students, since it hasn&#x2019;t brought us a single student who would like to work on some of our topics. We are now changing the strategy from using general keywords (like &#x201C;thesis topic&#x201D;) to using titles of well known and important papers and concepts specific to each study discipline. The most effective strategies so far seem to be posting in EA facebook groups and promotion by word of mouth. Interestingly, the strategy which may become several times more effective was to google our biggest competition in search results and ask them to promote our website. Since our main competitors in search results are blogs advising students on &#x201C;how to choose a thesis topic&#x201D; but not offering specific topics like we do, they can improve their content by linking us to their articles and we might get a great deal of relevant traffic from their websites. This idea came about from interviews with marketing professionals who we reached out to, and is a good example of non-zero-sum mindset.</span><span><br><br></span></p>\n<h4><span>Management</span></h4>\n<p><span>Since we offer topics via our website, success depends heavily on how the website is designed. We didn&#x2019;t have very much experience with web development and design and therefore it took us longer to make changes, with results being sub-optimal. However, we managed to create and run the website much more cheaply than if we paid professionals and improved valuable skills (website development, project management, teamwork) along the way. </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span><span>Steps that proved valuable included letting parts of the project which don&#x2019;t require a deep understanding of EA be managed by professional organizations, &#xA0;who now take care of areas of it for free as a part of their CSR programme (as we did with AdWords). Another useful step was to consult with other individual professionals who we found via websites connecting nonprofits and skilled short-term volunteers (</span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cl2GwFH2WT2h1GRSwSNhmy-ZPZ3Cza0iTOimEI3HaK0/edit?usp=sharing\"><span>here is the list</span></a><span> of such platforms we found).</span></p>\n<p><span><br><br></span></p>\n<h3><span>Forthcoming plans</span></h3>\n<p><span>As we reflected on the project development, we found that current model of working via EA orgs is not optimal. Some of the top EA research organizations are heavily time-constrained, and unable to spend much effort on proposing thesis topics, so the current topics selection; &#xA0;</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#xA0;<span>Doesn&#x2019;t represent the whole EA research landscape well (with more emphasis on wild animal suffering, for example, because the respective research organization was more cooperative in providing topics - a great help!)</span></li>\n<li><span>Many topics seem to be highly interesting, but likely not tractable within the scope of masters or even doctoral thesis. </span></li>\n<li><span>With many topics, it may be difficult to find an appropriate advisor. &#xA0;</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>In addition, the students, in general, do not have a comparative advantage in choosing topics, typically having neither previous experience with dissertation writing nor a very good overview of the research landscape.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Therefore, we have recently launched a different approach: individual <a href=\"http://effectivethesis.com/thesis-coaching/\">Thesis Topic Coaching</a>, a deliberative process in which we try to understand each student&#x2019;s needs and opportunities, and suggest tailored topics or research directions. When students choose one of our topics, we will try to find them consultants focusing specifically on their topics and will share their work with relevant organizations. The change should result in an increased uptake of our services and the quality of final research pieces. This will also enable us to focus less on web development, which took a significant proportion of the time we devoted to the project. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Another thing we are considering doing is to reach out to current academics with topics relevant to their expertise and asking them to start offering these as dissertation topics for their students. This might potentially be a more effective way of addressing students than an online website since consulting with teachers is a default option for most students searching for dissertation topics. At the same time this would allow academics to explore and become more familiar with EA topics via their students. </span></p>\n<p><span>We would like to encourage anyone interested in this path to contact us. &#xA0;</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3><span>Request for help</span></h3>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>As the project is ultimately trying to create a two-sided marketplace, it depends on the willingness of EA aligned researchers and research organizations to share promising research ideas and to offer the students consultations. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>We want to ask EA aligned researchers for cooperation in this respect - if you have the capacity to help, please contact us. It does not have to be a particularly costly process and does not create a commitment on your side.</span></p>\n<p><span>We also have a funding gap for 2018 sized circa 12000 USD, which we hope to cover mostly by grants, &#xA0;but individual donations are welcome and important - if you would like to donate, you can do it via Czech Effective Altruism Association in a tax-deductible way</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3><span>Our takeaways</span></h3>\n<ul>\n<li>&#xA0;<span>We are still convinced that choosing a dissertation topic is an important branching moment in a researcher&#x2019;s trajectory, which may not only generate hundreds of hours of additional research on an important topic, but may influence a researcher&#x2019;s long-term career. &#xA0;</span></li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Even in case of students planning non-research careers, working on an EA thesis topic can lead to deeper engagement with the ideas and community, generating more knowledgeable EAs and making current academics more familiar with the EA perspective.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>We are less sure that letting students choose for themselves from a list of topics proposed by EA research institutions is an effective way to utilize this branching moment.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>&#xA0;</h3>\n<h3><span>Credits</span></h3>\n<p><span>David Janku manages the project and put in most of the work. The web development was mainly undertaken by Dan Hnyk (programming) and David Hor&#xE1;k (copywriting), helped by many other volunteers. Jan Kulveit suggested the initial idea of steering research by promoting EA aligned theses topics and the direction change to thesis topic coaching.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>The project was financially supported by Greg Colbourn with the help of the volunteers P&#xE4;r Flodin, John Lidiard, Ronke Bankole, Nikita Hayward, Ji&#x159;&#xED; N&#xE1;dvorn&#xED;k and others, and uses an AdWords grant from Google managed by Brainlabs.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3><span>Come meet us!</span></h3>\n<p><span>We are holding an <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/177351499645550/\">Effective Thesis meetup on 7.5. at 7 pm</a> in <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/visitors/\">MIRI/CFAR office</a> in Berkeley, so if you&#xB4;re interested and around, we will be happy to meet you! &#xA0;</span></p>\n<p><br><br><br></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Jan_Kulveit"}}, {"_id": "TcS6squwsJSg2kdQm", "title": "A Concrete Model for Running an EA Group", "postedAt": "2018-05-31T16:45:29.750Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><em>This model was recently published <a href=\"https://ea-foundation.org/blog/local-group-model/\">on the EAF website</a>.&#xA0;If you are interested in EA local groups, I highly recommend Charlie Rogers-Smith&apos;s model of an EA group as well, which has been published on the <a href=\"https://app.effectivealtruism.org/groups/resources/a-model-of-an-ea-group\">CEA website</a>&#xA0;(and <a href=\"/ea/1p8/a_model_of_an_ea_group/\">EA forum</a>&#xA0;for discussion).</em></p>\n<p>When working on local group support at EAF, I noticed a relative lack of resources translating &apos;EA community building theory&apos; into concrete, actionable advice. For example, I found that many group leaders are aware and agree with the notion that many things in EA are heavy-tailed, but they don&apos;t know what implications this has for their local group. This model thus focuses on providing actionable advice to local group organisers who largely agree with the view on EA community building as e.g. <a href=\"https://app.effectivealtruism.org/groups/resources/effective-altruism-community-building\">described here</a> (more resources included below).</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<div>\n<p>The main goal of this approach to running an EA local group is to<strong> identify, attract, and develop top talent&#x2013;and help them have more impact.</strong></p>\n<p>I think EA local groups should focus on this because they have a <strong>comparative advantage at community building</strong>. The most valuable direct work often requires specialised skills and knowledge, and is best done in a professional context.</p>\n<p>Because effective altruism is complex and heavy-tailed, people will provide the most value to the community when they have developed a <strong>deep and sophisticated understanding of how to do good</strong>. Local groups are a great environment for interested people to engage deeply with the ideas of effective altruism.</p>\n<p>Therefore, I&#xA0; think local groups should:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Focus on the <strong>most engaged members</strong> of the group and their career planning, as opposed to continuously trying to onboard new people.</li>\n<li>Focus on <strong>learning and developing </strong>a more nuanced understanding of the ideas of effective altruism instead of hosting public events.</li>\n<li><strong>Not focus on having a lot of direct impact</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>The approach in a nutshell</h1>\n<h2>Stage I: Finding people</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Goal:</strong> Find new potential group members to attend a first event.</li>\n<li><strong>How: </strong>Various broad and narrow outreach activities; introductory event.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Stage II: Getting interested people involved</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Goal: </strong>Identify the most engaged people; deepen their understanding of core ideas and get them more involved.</li>\n<li><strong>How: </strong>EA seminar and face-to-face conversations.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Stage III: Career planning and integrating with the community</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Goal:</strong> Career planning for core members of the group.</li>\n<li><strong>How</strong>: Deeper engagement and learning through discussion groups, retreats, career planning groups and workshops.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Conceptually separating the three different stages leads to increased awareness and more explicit focus on the goals of your activities.</p>\n<h1>General advice for local group leaders</h1>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Deepen your own EA understanding</strong>: If you organise a group, you should have read most of the articles listed <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/resources/\">here</a>. There are two main reasons why this is important:\n<ol>\n<li>You might change your mind about your own plans. Since a lot of value from local groups comes from the group leaders themselves, this is an important consideration.</li>\n<li>We want to communicate EA ideas accurately and with appropriate nuance. This prevents dilution and makes effective altruism appealing to people who appreciate nuance and&#xA0;are skeptical of simple answers to complex issues.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Reading on community building:</strong> Other people have thought about EA community building a lot. These resources are particular important for group organisers: <a href=\"https://app.effectivealtruism.org/groups/resources/effective-altruism-community-buildi\">Effective Altruism Community Building</a>, <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/blog/the-fidelity-model-of-spreading-ideas/\">The Fidelity Model of Spreading Ideas</a>, <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/how-valuable-is-movement-growth-owen-cotton-barratt/\">How Valuable is Movement Growth?</a>, <a href=\"/ea/181/introducing_ceas_guiding_principles/\">CEA&#x2019;s guiding principles</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Offer, don&#x2019;t sell</strong>: There&#x2019;s no need to sell effective altruism to people very hard. If they are not interested when presented with the basic ideas and arguments, they will likely not become very engaged members of the community. Be happy with having offered the ideas&#x2013;if they don&#x2019;t bite, that&#x2019;s fine.</li>\n<li><strong>Use existing resources</strong>: There are more than a hundred active local groups around the world, so there&#x2019;s a high chance someone else has created the thing you need already. Use e.g. the group organisers <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/956362287803174/?ref=br_rs\">Facebook group</a> or join the <a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/eagroups/shared_invite/enQtMzA2NDQ1NzMxOTA3LThjOGNkZTU3NTc0OTc4NmY5YjFmNjRiZmI2ZGZiNTgyYzc1NjY2N2QwYzFmNmEzNjI3NTRkNDI0ZjcyNGM3Y2I\">EA Groups Slack</a> to ask people before putting effort into creating something new.</li>\n<li><strong>Consider your options</strong>: Community building is great if done well, but it&#x2019;s not necessarily the best use of your time. For some people it might be better to focus on building career capital, or deepening their understanding of effective altruism on their own. Among other things, this depends on how good you would be at community building and how big the target audience is in your location.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>A comment on the following:</em> I included a lot of concrete examples of how some steps could be implemented. In practice, groups will often have good reasons to deviate from various of these recommendations. They are best seen asabaseline to which group organisers can compare their activities.</p>\n<h1>Stage I: Finding people</h1>\n<p>This stage starts with outreach and promotion, usually a few weeks before lectures begin, and ends with an introductory event in the first few weeks of the semester.</p>\n<h2>Outreach</h2>\n<p><strong><em>Goal: </em></strong><em>Get potential group members to attend your introductory event.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Create a Facebook event</strong>: Use this FB event to invite people to the event. Take a look at EA Cambridge&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-6LWEpsdWY8Po5GhHAxyxB07xDzjsgj_2VieIEc9i48/edit#heading=h.bfv7b3fmw3nr\">best practices</a>. Also provide information somewhere outside of FB for people without an account. Meetup.com is one option, or your own website, if you have one.</li>\n<li><strong>EA pitch</strong>: For many of the activities during this stage you&#x2019;ll need to have a good EA pitch. Spend some time developing one you like, and practice it. Take a look at the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vsQdWIcL1nWdTTdQtB4uH1f_rIjDo27-CwaZUnfqEG4/edit\">EA Pitch guide</a> for examples.</li>\n<li>Some potential group members might not be able to attend your event. Consider sending them a recording of a good introductory talk, and inform them about the EA seminar (see below) if they indicate interest.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How to reach your target audience</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Referrals</strong>: Invite people from your personal network. Send them a personal message, and ask them to bring friends. Ask all current group members to do the same. This has a track record of working exceptionally well.</li>\n<li><strong>Freshers&#x2019; Fairs</strong>: If your university has a well frequented freshers&#x2019; fair, participate with your group. The goal is to get as many email addresses as possible so you can send people an invitation to your event. More info: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fh2orJ_bpdTrloRA4lnyUqMQ-8iMkY6aXfLvW8DHF0w/edit\">Student activities fair guide</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Reach out to narrow target groups</strong>: Identify particularly promising groups (e.g. secular humanist groups, scholarship groups, the rationalist community), send them a short pitch, maybe a TED talk to watch, and invite them to your event.</li>\n<li><strong>Facebook ads</strong>: Use Facebook ads to target people who could be interested and a good fit for the community.</li>\n<li><strong>Promotion in classes</strong>: Ask professors if you could promote the event at the beginning of your university classes.</li>\n<li><strong>Social media</strong>: If your group has a social media presence, send a personal message to people who follow your page.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Introductory event</h2>\n<p><strong><em>Goal: </em></strong><em>Appeal to and identify potential group members, get them to sign up for the EA seminar, and/or schedule a meeting over coffee with them.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>What kind of event: </strong>Depending on your time and organic group growth, this could be an introductory EA talk, a more informal get-together, or a workshop. Talks are recommended if you have a great speaker and/or if you have very little organic growth. Groups with sufficient organic growth and time constraints could do a more informal event instead. Groups with sufficient organic growth and time could host an introductory workshop on the core ideas.</li>\n<li><strong>Promote the EA seminar: </strong>Remember that the main goal of this stage is to appeal to potential group members and get them to participate in your EA seminar, and/or to meet them over coffee (see below). Optimise for this.</li>\n<li><strong>Provide snacks and drinks</strong>: This usually leads to significantly more people staying, and people staying longer, too.</li>\n<li><strong>Talk to people: </strong>Talk to as many interested people as possible to find out who might sign up for the EA seminar, and make sure they enter their email address into one of your lists. Even a brief personal interaction can significantly increase the chance that someone will decide to participate in the seminar.</li>\n<li><strong>Contact info</strong>: You might not be able to talk to everyone. Address the audience and encourage people to get in touch with you in other ways if they&#x2019;re interested, and make sure they know how to do so. Prepare a list for people to write down their email addresses.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>A few notes on organising and logistics</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Start early</strong>: You want this event to be organised well, so you should start early. Finding a suitable room can be cumbersome, especially if you&#x2019;re not yet an official university group. External speakers should also be approached at least a few weeks in advance.</li>\n<li><strong>Assign responsibilities</strong>: One person should take the lead. Assign responsibilities for specific tasks to other group members, create checklists, and define how and when you want to check in with the team.</li>\n<li><strong>Professional impression</strong>: There are some additional things that are low effort and can make a big difference in how your event will be perceived:\n<ul>\n<li>Get a group roll-up banner.</li>\n<li>Put up signs so that people will find their way to the room.</li>\n<li>Be at the venue early so you have time to set everything up nicely.</li>\n<li>If you use projectors or microphones, test them.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Introductory EA talk</h3>\n<p>This is only relevant If you do decide to go for an introductory EA talk as your first event.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>External speaker: </strong>Consider inviting an external speaker who has given such talks before. External speakers draw bigger audiences and may have more expertise.</li>\n<li><strong>Standard EA talk: </strong>If you do a presentation yourself, strongly consider using one of the <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vz9UFrvb5MahzpoWLwahena5dsQaUYRt\">standard EA talks</a>. Take a look at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/spencer.greenberg/posts/10103358570449692\">these tips on public speaking</a> as well.</li>\n<li><strong>Topics to cover</strong>: These are the most important topics to cover:\n<ul>\n<li>Commitment to Others: Why we try to do the most good.</li>\n<li>Scientific Mindset: Cost-effectiveness, expected value thinking.</li>\n<li>Openness: Cause neutrality and prioritization, overview of causes.</li>\n<li>Integrity &amp; Collaborative Mindset: The effective altruism community.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Q&amp;A: </strong>Give people the opportunity to ask questions. People often find the Q&amp;A to be particularly insightful. If you do the Q&amp;A yourself, read through <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/faqs-criticism-objections/\">these EA FAQs</a> beforehand.</li>\n<li><strong>Feedback forms</strong>: Use these to learn how you can improve and as a means to getting in touch with people. Here&#x2019;s a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/11nF6L4VZ9Spqck916cbt-MrBtunJqU3joHCLC4TBhRE/edit\">feedback form template</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Informal discussion</strong>: Transition to informal discussions afterwards and encourage people to stick around and talk to others.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Stage II: Getting interested people involved</h1>\n<h2>Meet people over coffee</h2>\n<p><strong><em>Goal: </em></strong><em>Get interested people more engaged and provide them with resources. </em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Why this is important</strong>: Face-to-face discussion are often the best way to get people more engaged with effective altruism. They allow you to discuss effective altruism and your group in more detail. Face-to-face discussions allow you to communicate with more <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/blog/the-fidelity-model-of-spreading-ideas/\">nuance</a> and address their specific questions.</li>\n<li><strong>Timing: </strong>Focus on this right after your first event and before the seminar starts. Personal interaction is likely to be crucial for a lot of people&#x2019;s decision to sign up for the seminar.</li>\n<li><strong>Do follow-ups</strong>: You won&#x2019;t be able to cover all relevant considerations in one or even several such meetings. Send people a personalised list of reading recommendations after you met them for coffee.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep inferential distances in mind</strong>: If you do such meetings, keep <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Inferential_distance\">inferential distances</a> in mind and interpret their contributions accordingly. Consider what information they have, and how much exposure to effective altruism ideas they&#x2019;ve already had when forming a judgment about their fit for the group. Pay attention to their willingness and ability to change their mind when presented with compelling arguments.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em>Note: </em>While there are good reasons to do this before the seminar (see above), meeting people over coffee is something you ideally do year-round. The importance of face-to-face conversations is hard to overstate. If you only do one thing with your group, make it this.</p>\n<h2>EA seminar</h2>\n<p><strong><em>Goal: </em></strong><em>Deepen the understanding of effective altruism ideas. </em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Format:</strong> You could do two-hour sessions, one evening per week, over the course of 3 &#x2013; 4 weeks. Alternatively, you could do the entire seminar in one or two days. You can use a combination of input talks, group discussions, and workshops. People should be willing to do some reading or watch talks to prepare for the seminar sessions.</li>\n<li><strong>Why it&#x2019;s useful:</strong> You provide a platform for interested people to engage more deeply with relevant ideas, learn more about the effective altruism community, and interact with like-minded people.</li>\n<li><strong>Limit group size: </strong>Make sure the group size allows you to address everyone&#x2019;s questions, and creates a familiar atmosphere.</li>\n<li><strong>Outsource teaching: </strong>You don&#x2019;t need to do input talks yourselves&#x2013;plenty of good talks are available online, e.g. from previous <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEfASxwPxzsHlG5Rf1-4K9w\">EA Global conferences</a>. You could also ask people to do a talk or a Q&amp;A for the group over Skype.</li>\n<li><strong>Registration: </strong>Have people register in advance (e.g. through a Google Form), and ask a few questions before confirming their participation. People should already have at least a basic understanding of what effective altruism is and isn&#x2019;t about, to have a serious interest in doing the most good, and be aligned with the core tenets of effective altruism.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Example syllabus for the seminar</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Week 1 &#x2013; Core concepts</strong>: Consider using <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/prospecting-for-gold-owen-cotton-barratt/\">Prospecting for Gold</a> as a deeper introduction to many important effective altruism ideas and concepts.</li>\n<li><strong>Week 2 &#x2013; Cause prioritization</strong>: Reasons to focus on different causes (values, empirical beliefs, etc.). Consider discussing 80,000 Hours&#x2019; <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2017/11/talent-gaps-survey-2017/#ea-leaders-believe-that-giving-focussed-on-the-ea-community-and-long-term-future-is-more-effective-than-that-on-global-poverty-or-animal-welfare\">survey</a> on what people who work at EA orgs focus on.</li>\n<li><strong>Week 3</strong> <strong>&#x2013; The effective altruism movement</strong>: History, organizations, people. Important resources and ways to learn more.</li>\n<li><strong>Week 4 &#x2013; Rationality &amp; other tools and concepts:</strong> Cover some widely used tools and concepts and resources, e.g. rationality, cognitive biases, <a href=\"https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/\">EA concepts</a>.</li>\n<li>Take a look at <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/resources/\">these resources</a> for inspiration.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Stage III: Career planning and integrating with the community</h1>\n<p>This stage is where you reap the benefits of the work done in Stage I and II. Building on this, we you now focus on career plan changes and integrating new members into the wider effective altruism community. The following are some <strong>metrics</strong> for this stage (in order of importance):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The number of <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-planning/\"><strong>A/B/Z career plans</strong></a> for group members, where plan A is one of 80,000 Hours&#x2019; <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/coaching/#priority-paths\">priority paths</a>.</li>\n<li>The number of group members who receive <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/coaching/\"><strong>coaching</strong></a> by 80,000 Hours, or alternatively (since 80,000 Hours is currently quite strongly capacity constraint) group members who do a call with another senior EA who can give guidance.</li>\n<li>The number of group members who participate in an <a href=\"https://www.eaglobal.org/\"><strong>EA Global conference</strong></a>.</li>\n<li>The number of group members who&#xA0; take the <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/\"><strong>GWWC pledge</strong></a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Career planning groups</h2>\n<p><strong><em>Goal:</em></strong><em> Write and improve A/B/Z career plans.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Why: </strong>Choosing a career is probably the most important decision many group members will make in terms of how much it can affect the impact they can have. Career planning groups produce value by improving the quality of this decision.</li>\n<li><strong>Content:</strong> Read the 80,000 Hours <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/\">career guide</a>, the <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/research/#advanced-career-guide\">advanced career guide</a>, and other <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/blog/\">blog posts</a> and <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/\">podcasts</a> relevant to this.</li>\n<li><strong>Format:</strong> You could watch content together, run discussions on career choice, sessions where members develop their A/B/Z plan, or feedback sessions where people comment on other members&#x2019; A/B/Z plans.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Discussion groups</h2>\n<p><strong><em>Goal:</em></strong><em> Further increase understanding of important ideas and concepts, cause prioritisation.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Why: </strong>Further increasing participants&#x2019; understanding of effective altruism, and keeping up with recent developments in the community.</li>\n<li><strong>Content:</strong> You could discuss recent top posts on the <a href=\"/\">EA forum</a>, 80,000 Hours&#x2018; <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/\">problem profiles</a>, articles published by other EA organizations (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/\">FHI</a>, <a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/\">FRI</a>, <a href=\"http://sentienceinstitute.org/\">SI</a>), or watch <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEfASxwPxzsHlG5Rf1-4K9w\">EA Global talks</a> and discuss them. Cause prioritization in general is a great topic for discussion groups.</li>\n<li><strong>Format: </strong>There are many <a href=\"http://www.spencergreenberg.com/2017/03/better-formats-for-group-interaction-going-beyond-lectures-group-discussions-panels-and-mixers/#.Whg7g7SFhTY\">different ways</a> to structure the activity. A reasonable default is for one person to take the lead, and prepare questions for the discussion in advance. Group members could do input talks too.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Social meetups</h2>\n<p><strong><em>Goal: </em></strong><em>Accommodate newly interested people; socialise with other group members.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Why:&#xA0;</strong>New people might discover your group at this stage, but don&#x2019;t yet have the same level of knowledge as other group members who e.g. participated in your EA seminar. Therefore, you might not want to invite them to one of the other Stage III groups right away. However, excluding them entirely until the next EA seminar would also be suboptimal. Regular social meetups (as well as meeting people over coffee) can serve as a good way of accommodating people in this stage without interfering with your other group activities. Additionally, informal meetups also strengthen the social ties in your local group.</li>\n<li><strong>Content: </strong>No specific content. Briefly explain the approach of your group to new people, and explain how they can best get involved.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Research projects</h2>\n<p><strong><em>Goal: </em></strong><em>Immerse yourselves into a topic, learn more, and produce valuable research output. </em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Why: </strong>Immersing yourselves into a topic can help you and others evaluating your fit for research roles, has high learning value and ideally results in a piece of relevant research output (e.g. as a post on the EA forum).</li>\n<li><strong>Why not: </strong>Most groups and group members should focus on career planning and discussion groups during this stage, and research projects should only be tackled if you have spare resources and the benefits of these other activities seem fairly small.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://app.effectivealtruism.org/groups/resources/activity-ideas\">See here</a> for more info on how you could do this.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Group retreats</h2>\n<p><strong><em>Goal</em></strong><em>: Can help achieving the goals of different other Stage III activities. </em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Why:</strong> Group retreats (or workshops) can create more focus, engagement and are a great way for group members to get to know each other better.</li>\n<li><strong>Content:</strong> You could cover any of the content you would cover if you did one of the above-mentioned activities</li>\n<li><strong>Format:</strong> Similarly, a combination of different formats can be used at retreats (discussion groups, career planning sessions, social activities).</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Meet people over coffee</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Keep doing this: </strong>Listing this again for this stage to emphasise how important it is. As written above, this is something you ideally do continuously. It also works well for discussing specific uncertainties someone might have regarding their career plans.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Further resources</h1>\n<p>This list is not exhaustive, but these are some further resources particularly relevant for local group organisers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://app.effectivealtruism.org/groups/resources/a-model-of-an-ea-group\">A Model of an EA Group</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/ea/1nh/heuristics_from_running_harvard_and_oxford_ea/\">Heuristics from Running Harvard and Oxford EA Groups</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/ea/1l3/announcing_effective_altruism_community_building/\">Community Building Grants</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://app.effectivealtruism.org/groups/resources/mentorship-and-funding\">Mentorship and Funding</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/blog/considering-considerateness-why-communities-of-do-gooders-should-be/\">Why communities of do-gooders should be exceptionally considerate</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/ea/5p/keeping_the_effective_altruist_movement_welcoming/\">Keeping the effective altruist movement welcoming</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/ea/zu/action_steps_for_inclusive_ea_groups/\">Making EA Groups More Welcoming</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/ea/v4/guidelines_on_depicting_poverty/\">Guidelines on depicting poverty</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div></body></html>", "user": {"username": "tobiaspulver"}}, {"_id": "tny62ELsfnPNtY2Tx", "title": "A Model of an EA Group", "postedAt": "2018-05-31T16:00:05.950Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>This document was recently published&#xA0;on the <a href=\"https://app.effectivealtruism.org/groups/resources/a-model-of-an-ea-group\">CEA website</a>.&#xA0;If you are interested in EA local groups, I strongly recommend reading Tobias Pulver&apos;s model of an EA group as well, which has been published on the <a href=\"https://ea-foundation.org/blog/local-group-model/\">EAF website</a>.</p>\n<h1>A Model of an EA Group</h1>\n<p>EA groups are well suited to find and foster the development of people who are highly dedicated to, have a sophisticated understanding of, and possess skills relevant to working on the world&apos;s most pressing problems. Furthermore, EA groups are well positioned to integrate these people with the broader EA community. This document builds on the&#xA0;<a href=\"https://app.effectivealtruism.org/groups/resources/effective-altruism-community-building\">Local EA Community Building Guide</a>&#xA0;to provide a model of how an EA group might increase the motivation of group members to take high impact actions &#x2014; namely&#xA0;high impact careers&#xA0;&#x2014; and ensure group members are thinking very carefully about what the highest impact actions are for them.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s important to note that this is just one model of an EA group, and because of the writer&#x2019;s experience one that is particularly suited to student groups, though the approach to viewing a group in terms of its inputs, processes, outputs and measures is likely to be generally useful.</p>\n<h2>The funnel</h2>\n<p>You can view the operation of a group as a funnel: people enter the funnel when they are first introduced to effective altruism, and exit either through leakage at any stage, or out of the bottom as deeply engaged individuals leading high-impact careers. Leakage should always be avoided, but prioritisation&#xA0;<em>within</em>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<em>between</em>&#xA0;stages is very important: in the same time it takes to convince someone that EA might be reasonable, you might be able to structure a detailed career plan for an already committed member, or use a more efficient approach to convince 2 people to consider EA ideas for the first time. We never want to lose people through leakage, but it is an inevitable consequence of prioritization. Trying to get a few people&#xA0;<span>all the way through</span>&#xA0;the funnel is more important than getting&#xA0;<em>every</em>&#xA0;person to the next stage.</p>\n<p>Below we list some potential stages of the funnel, which we then explore in detail. These stages are somewhat arbitrary, and there are likely funnels with different numbers and types of stages that work equally well. Not all the sub-stages will be necessary for every person, but they seem to work well for the average individual.</p>\n<p><span>Introducing people</span></p>\n<p>Raising awareness, following up.</p>\n<p><span>Developing motivation and knowledge</span></p>\n<p>Absorbing key ideas, making personal connections with EAs, group activities.</p>\n<p><span>Deep engagement</span></p>\n<p>Integration with the wider community, career planning, Effective Altruism Global.</p>\n<p><span>Long-term engagement</span></p>\n<p>Taking high-impact careers. Joining/setting up another EA group.</p>\n<h3>Introducing people</h3>\n<h4>Raising Awareness</h4>\n<p>Getting people to join an EA group will often involve introducing people to effective altruism for the first time. Freshers&#x2019; Fair is the largest opportunity to find people in student groups, and good introductory events following this include introductory presentations and discussion groups. Common methods of advertising events include making an event on Facebook and having members invite their friends, having the event promoted through the university, and reaching out to other groups with shared interests (e.g. ethics, animal welfare, rationality, careers etc.).</p>\n<p>Ensuring that ideas are presented accurately is very important for ensuring that people who will gain the most value from the effective altruism community are inclined to become more involved. This means choosing speakers who can represent effective altruism particularly well, and referring to EA materials in presenting information oneself.</p>\n<p>There can be a tradeoff in the number of people you reach and the&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/blog/the-fidelity-model-of-spreading-ideas/\">fidelity</a>&#xA0;and nuance of your message. The value is roughly multiplicative between these two factors, and low fidelity approaches done poorly can often have negative effects. An example is talking to the media about earning to give (ETG). At its core ETG is complex and nuanced, and it&#x2019;s likely that a single article with large reach will end up spreading ideas that are related to, but importantly different from the ideas we want to spread[^fn-1]. Therefore when deciding how to increase awareness it&#x2019;s important to keep in mind the fidelity of your approach, and the most effective path to the later stages.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s important to note the difference between a low-fidelity (by definition) advertising approach that leads to a high-fidelity event, and a low-fidelity event. The former is a somewhat necessary form of outreach, the latter may not be desirable.</p>\n<h4>Following Up</h4>\n<p>Following up with people individually is a particularly good method of transition from finding people who are particularly interested in becoming more involved. One-on-one interaction like a coffee meetup is a very&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/blog/the-fidelity-model-of-spreading-ideas/\">high fidelity</a>&#xA0;method of conveying EA ideas, and should be a&#xA0;<span>main focus</span>&#xA0;of the group for this reason.</p>\n<p>The key idea here is not that you are going to be able to adequately explain all of the crucial EA concepts in a 30-60 minute meeting. What you can do is provide a link and a friendly face to the EA community, give them an overview of your group, provoke their interest and then point them towards material. Giving a copy of Doing Good Better (DGB) (for which you can get funding) is very common, as well as sending links to articles that are specific to their interests (e.g. from 80,000 Hours). It&#x2019;s worth mentioning that DGB is partially outdated, but is probably still a good starting point to learn core EA ideas. Finally, try and introduce EA as sophisticated and complex from the very beginning; making EA sound simpler than they are has historically had bad long run consequences (i.e. EA is all about efficient charity).</p>\n<p>Some common methods of contacting people include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Adding and messaging on Facebook if you had a conversation with someone at an event. This has the advantage of being direct and hard to avoid</li>\n<li>Using&#xA0;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=11nF6L4VZ9Spqck916cbt-MrBtunJqU3joHCLC4TBhRE\">feedback forms</a>&#xA0;at events with check boxes for coffee meetings, email addresses, resources etc.. this doesn&#x2019;t require that you know them personally</li>\n<li>Collecting email addresses at the start of an event</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Groups shouldn&#x2019;t have to rely on the memory of the group organizers alone, and keeping a list of interested people can help to avoid losses in informal knowledge that occur when current group leaders leave.</p>\n<h3>Developing motivation and knowledge</h3>\n<p>The majority of the value of your group will come from the members who are most motivated and knowledgeable, because they are aware of the best opportunities and are willing to take them. We have split this development broadly into three sections: absorbing key ideas, making personal connections with EAs, and group activities. It&#x2019;s important to note that these sections have a lot of overlap, and that development may begin at any of these stages.</p>\n<h4>Absorbing key ideas</h4>\n<p>A member can learn a lot from attending group events, but it&#x2019;s unlikely that they&#x2019;ll get a nuanced picture of EA solely through these. At some point it becomes necessary to engage with all of the key ideas of Effective Altruism, which will help to develop both motivation and knowledge. Absorbing key ideas might currently look like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Reading Doing Good Better after a one-on-one meeting or intro event</li>\n<li>Reading the&#xA0;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B3e7YyU07e4UV2x2dGZ6SGhIQkE\">80,000 Hours Career Guide</a></li>\n<li>Reading some&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/introduction-to-effective-altruism/\">introductory material</a></li>\n<li>Reading&#xA0;<a href=\"http://effectivealtruism.org/resources\">these</a>&#xA0;resources</li>\n<li>Listening to the&#xA0;<a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/80000-hours\">80,000 Hours podcast</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Making personal connections with EAs</h4>\n<p>Socials are particularly successful events for forming connections and promoting a sense of community belonging. People have the opportunity to get to know one-another in an informal space, friendships can form, and motivation compounds as members become more accountable to each other. Regularity of socials (i.e. the same day of the week, every week) seems important for driving regular attendance, and free pizza &#x2014;&#xA0;for which you can get funding &#x2014;&#xA0;is an incredible predictor of event attendance.&#xA0;<a href=\"https://app.effectivealtruism.org/groups/resources/activity-ideas\">Retreats</a>&#xA0;can have similar community building effects to socials, but are more intense and commonly have a stronger education component. It&#x2019;s always possible in a social interaction that you are the first EA to establish a connection with an individual, and as a representative of EA it&#x2019;s very important to be friendly, welcoming and&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/blog/considering-considerateness-why-communities-of-do-gooders-should-be/\">considerate</a>.</p>\n<h4>Group activities</h4>\n<p>One tried and tested method of member development in student groups is discussion groups, where group members read an article related to effective altruism and have a structured discussion during the event (see&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/resources/\">here</a>&#xA0;for articles). Another promising activity is&#xA0;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1htwGwHTI3JATxmKAS_fDX6E6elT9tKCn\">beginner career workshops</a>, where attendees are introduced to 80,000 Hours concepts, cause areas, and career paths. They can then work to discuss and develop their prospective career plans.</p>\n<p>In running a group you will likely have to cater to different levels of understanding between members. This can be tricky &#x2014;&#xA0;if the content of the activities is pitched too high, it can be alienating to new members who don&#x2019;t have the relevant background understanding. If the content is pitched too low, this can cause previously engaged members to become bored and leave the group, as a result of not learning anything new. Segmenting the group can help to deal with this. This could be by having different activities and events targeted at different levels of understanding, or by having newer members arrive early to group activities and introducing the relevant background concepts to them. Examples of events for advanced members in student groups might include advanced discussion groups and career planning sessions. The latter can be easily adapted from the second&#xA0;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1htwGwHTI3JATxmKAS_fDX6E6elT9tKCn\">careers workshop</a>. Networking with others in a specific area is common for non-student groups.</p>\n<h3>Deep engagement</h3>\n<h4>Integrating with the wider community</h4>\n<p>The effective altruism community&#x2019;s understanding of how to do the most good is developing quickly, and so in order to build a local community with the best understanding of this it&#x2019;s particularly important to ensure your group is in contact with new developments. This is especially important because historically there has been lag time between the latest developments and groups acting on them, which can be harmful for the movement (e.g. by&#xA0;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/07/80000-hours-thinks-that-only-a-small-proportion-of-people-should-earn-to-give-long-term/\">promoting only earning to give</a>). It&#x2019;s good to ensure that you and your group are aware of:</p>\n<p><a href=\"/\">The Effective Altruism Forum</a>&#xA0;- for the latest advances in Effective Altruism</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/\">80,000 Hours</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/\">The Effective Altruism Newsletter</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/956362287803174/\">The Group Organizers Facebook Page</a></p>\n<p>Another important reason for ensuring your group is integrated with the community is so your group members can learn about further opportunities to do good. In 5 years a lot of the advice given here might be inaccurate, and keeping up to date with the most recent developments should limit this effect somewhat.</p>\n<h4>Career Planning</h4>\n<p>The one-on-one coffee meetups mentioned earlier are &#x2018;introductory&#x2019; in nature, however this in-person interaction is very effective for helping already committed members further their career plans; as an&#xA0;<span>advanced coffee meetup</span>. If they are already interested in a&#xA0;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/coaching/#priority-paths\">priority area</a>&#xA0;then you can encourage them to make a concrete&#xA0;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/career-planning/\">ABZ</a>&#xA0;plan. It might also be a good idea to give them books specific to this cause area (e.g. Superintelligence), for which you can get funding. If they are not interested in taking a priority path (or equivalent) but have potential to take a priority path (or equivalent), then encouraging them to read&#xA0;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/\">problem profiles</a>&#xA0;and make explicit cause prioritization decisions (e.g. &#x201C;What do you think the most important thing to work on is?&#x201D;) might be a good idea, because it provides the opportunity for you to explain the arguments for priority cause areas and the steps one can take to reduce uncertainty. Career planning sessions are an alternative to advanced coffee meetups, in which a group of people (perhaps with similar interests) help to further each other&#x2019;s plans.</p>\n<h4>Effective Altruism Global (EAG)</h4>\n<p>EA Global is the annual conference of the effective altruism community, where speakers and participants discuss new thinking, share new research, and coordinate on global projects. EAG is aimed towards people who are seeking the opportunity to master more complex problems in Effective Altruism, learn new skills, or get help from the community. As well as a strong knowledge component, the social aspect of EAGs is not to be underestimated: gathering a group of people with shared values who want to help each other do good is very powerful, and inevitably results in great conversations, new friendships, and a strong sense of community.

For this reason,&#xA0;<span>having group members lead high impact careers should be a principal goal of your group</span>, and this is the key reason why the previous stages in the funnel are valuable.</p>\n<h4>Joining/setting up another EA group</h4>\n<p>Both students and non-students commonly leave groups for one reason or another. While this can happen at any stage of the funnel, maintaining membership of an EA group independent of location is a long-term commitment, and hence a route to value. A new group can help get a member all the way through the funnel or provide the infrastructure to allow the member to push others through, depending on their position in the funnel. Setting up a new EA group is a great opportunity for deeply engaged individuals with a good fit for movement building, because setting up a group may be low hanging fruit that leads to large future impact. It&#x2019;s unlikely that an individual will be able to set up a very successful group in a short amount of time, but they can lay the foundations of such a group and focus on sustaining it.</p>\n<h2>Sustaining the group</h2>\n<p>The value or organising an effective altruism group also includes the value of establishing or maintaining a successful institution for future organisers. It&#x2019;s plausible that&#xA0;<span>the majority of the value that your group generates will happen when you&#x2019;re gone</span>, so the maintenance of your group is of vital importance.</p>\n<p>When finding people willing and able to run your group after the current organizers leave, it&#x2019;s essential that they know what&#x2019;s required of them. A common method for student groups is to have prospective committee members meet with the current organizers to discuss expectations and personal fit. Having efficient,&#xA0;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Xc-DZMRhYk-cMV5tj9yvFwOD1G6bltGao-bgWsJ4TZY/edit?usp=sharing\">well documented processes</a>&#xA0;and a handover period for new group organizers can facilitate the new organizers being able to take over the group successfully. A short handover period is probably not sufficient for the core group leaders, and so starting to mentor people to succeed you over a much longer period is a good idea. This way you can be sure that there are in fact people to succeed you, and that they have the right models ingrained in them.</p>\n<h2>Metrics</h2>\n<p>Metrics are measures of a goal. Groups may find using metrics useful because they make the goal&#x2019;s success conditions explicit, and so easier to aim for, and also because they provide feedback on how well a group is performing relative to its goals. Two types of metrics are&#xA0;<span>lag</span>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<span>lead</span>&#xA0;metrics: Lag metrics are quantitative measures of a goal, and lead metrics are quantitative measures of processes directed at achieving a goal.[^fn-2]</p>\n<h3>Lag Metrics</h3>\n<p>A potential core lag metric for deep engagement within a group is the number of people who are intending on taking/currently leading high impact careers in&#xA0;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/coaching/?int_campaign=local-group__strategy-doc#page-block-uzr4nwh39b\">priority paths</a>. This is because by having a career in a priority path we select for both people that are dedicated to improving the world and for people that have a sophisticated understanding of how to improve the world, and this is strongly related to EA groups&#x2019; route to producing value. Also the metric is simple to use, and operationalizes depth of engagement in an observable way.</p>\n<p>There will be many sources of value that are not reflected in this metric: importantly, for example, groups can also provide a lot of value for people who have already decided their careers. However, if a group has many members who are intending to take/currently leading high impact careers, it seems likely that the group is doing well, which makes it useful as a target.</p>\n<h3>Lead Metrics</h3>\n<p>Here are some suggestions for lead metrics to use at each stage of the funnel:</p>\n<p>Finding people</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Raising awareness - number of people who express interest in learning more about effective altruism via an event feedback form. Number of people at intro events</li>\n<li>Following up - number of people met with 1-1 to discuss becoming more involved in the group</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Developing motivation and knowledge</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Absorbing key ideas - copies of Doing Good Better or other core EA books distributed, copies of the 80k careers guide distributed</li>\n<li>Making personal connections with EAs - number of new people coming to socials, how welcomed new people feel on a 1-10 scale</li>\n<li>Group activities - &#xA0;number of attendees of workshops or other EA content focused events</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Deep engagement</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Integration with the wider community - number of members who regularly read the Effective Altruism Forum</li>\n<li>Career planning - number of people with an ABZ career plan</li>\n<li>EAG - number of attendees from your group</li>\n<li>Giving What We Can pledge - number of members who have taken the pledge</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Long-term engagement</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Taking high-impact careers - number of people with detailed career plans for&#xA0;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/coaching/?int_campaign=local-group__strategy-doc#page-block-uzr4nwh39b\">priority paths</a>&#xA0;(or equivalent). Although 80,000 Hours Coaching applications are temporarily closed, their criteria[^fn-3]&#xA0;remain a useful benchmark</li>\n<li>Number of people who join/set up another group when they leave</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Sustaining the group</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Number of engaged group members who want to run the group for the following year</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&#x2019;s important to note that the above are possible measures of success rather than success itself, and that optimizing for these measures can make them less correlated with success. For example, distributing lots of books to people who don&#x2019;t actually want them may do well on the metrics, but be of little value, or even harmful.</p>\n<h2>A Short Note on Funding</h2>\n<p>Funding for group activities is available through CEA, and&#xA0;<span>groups shouldn&#x2019;t need to fundraise themselves</span>. It&#x2019;s likely not the best use of their time, for reasons outlined in the&#xA0;<a href=\"https://app.effectivealtruism.org/groups/resources/effective-altruism-community-building\">Local EA Community Building Guide</a>. You can apply for funding&#xA0;<a href=\"https://app.effectivealtruism.org/groups/resources/mentorship-and-funding\">here</a>.</p>\n<h1>Prioritization</h1>\n<p>As members of the effective altruism community, you&#x2019;re probably very familiar with prioritization. Like the real world, groups are also resource constrained &#x2014;&#xA0;primarily by time &#x2014;&#xA0;and so it&#x2019;s important at each stage of the funnel to prioritize the most effective actions to ensure maximum flow-through to the next stage, i.e.&#xA0;<span>within-stage prioritization</span>. This might include deciding which events to run for developing knowledge and motivation: is a careers workshop more valuable than a speaker event? What is the relative value in each of these? How do they create movement into the next stage? How long do they take to organize/run? Are there any negative effects?</p>\n<p>Equally important is&#xA0;<span>between-stage prioritization</span>. Should you invest time in intro coffee meetings or do advanced coffee meetings with the top 5% of committed people (finding people vs deep engagement)? It&#x2019;s clear that we need both of these activities, and unlike the previous prioritization we can&#x2019;t afford to stop either activity. You can however shift the weight of your efforts based on similar questions to above, and relevant factors of your group e.g. size.</p>\n<p>By prioritizing the best inputs (activities) for your desired outputs (flow-through to the end of the funnel), it&#x2019;s feasible that you can double your group&#x2019;s impact without any increase in resources. In addition to prioritization,&#xA0;<em>growing your organizing capacity</em>&#xA0;will help you spread your limited resources effectively. This is a large topic however, which we don&#x2019;t attempt to address here.</p>\n<h2>Limitations of the model</h2>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>The ideal model for a group will depend on its size, age and type</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Particularly important here is between-stage prioritization: for large groups it seems reasonable to prioritize actions that will further people already a fair way through the funnel, whereas the converse might be true of groups just starting out</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some people who exit the funnel will have much larger impact than others</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I don&#x2019;t think we sufficiently account for negative effects. Some countermeasures might include:</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>High-fidelity outreach activities</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Avoiding campaigning on controversial issues</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Take actions which are seen as good by societal standards as well as for the movement</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We don&#x2019;t touch on the organisation of a group; including structure and management</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The model points towards pushing people with the highest potential impact all the way through the funnel, which to some extent goes against forming an inclusive and diverse community. This is a large limitation, which should be addressed in full elsewhere.</p>\n</li>\n</ul></body></html>", "user": {"username": "CharlieRS"}}, {"_id": "MZPfcHuFZ36HdMy87", "title": "Why EAs in particular are good people to start charities", "postedAt": "2018-05-30T20:41:26.915Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>There have been previous posts about the impact of </span><a href=\"/ea/151/what_is_the_expected_value_of_creating_a_givewell/\"><span>founding a new GiveWell charity</span></a><span>, </span><a href=\"/ea/pi/why_charity_entrepreneurship/\"><span>the impact of charity founding</span></a><span>, and </span><a href=\"/ea/1og/why_founding_charities_is_one_of_the_highest/\"><span>some of the results of charities founded by EAs</span></a><span>. This post, however, focuses on a specific question I get a lot. Namely, why should EAs in particular start charities? This is especially a concern for many EAs who are younger or inexperienced. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>I think a strong piece of evidence for this is the historical track record of EAs founding high impact charities. Given that I already covered that in a </span><a href=\"/ea/1og/why_founding_charities_is_one_of_the_highest/\"><span>previous post</span></a><span>, I want to focus this one on why it&apos;s not just fluke or limited to extremely talented EAs, as well as the core reasons I think EAs can outperform other folks aiming to start nonprofits. My experience with this question comes from having worked in several charities founded by EAs and starting multiple ones myself. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Overview relative to other founders: </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>EAs will often be better at:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Cause and intervention selection</li>\n<li>Value alignment</li>\n<li>Networks and resources</li>\n<li>Measurement and evaluation</li>\n<li>Dedication and focus</li>\n<li>Personal ability</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>EAs will often be worse at:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Experience working and managing broadly</li>\n<li>Experience in the field</li>\n<li>Connections within field</li>\n<li>Related degree</li>\n<li>Personal attachment to the cause</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>These are listed roughly in order of importance on each side. The rest of this post will explore each of these points in a bit more depth. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>EAs will often be better at cause and intervention selection</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>The first point is one of the clearest. A huge amount of the impact rests on which specific charity gets created. Launching something aimed at being recommended by Animal Charity Evaluators or GiveWell leads to very different interventions than the vast majority of social endeavors. Most nonprofits focus on the personal experience of the founder, not on the most relevant data available. EAs are much more likely to use that data when making an initial charity selection. It&#x2019;s not shocking that charities like Evidence Action or Charity Science Health go far in GiveWell&#x2019;s system, as these sorts of charities have similar underlying goals of making the most possible impact per dollar using the available evidence. If EAs generally start fundamentally more high impact ideas, that goes a long way (although far from the whole way) towards having a large impact. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>EAs will often be better at value alignment</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>It&#x2019;s easy for any charity, even EA charities, to get mixed up about the goals the charity is trying to accomplish. Are we trying to get bigger as an organization or have more impact? Are we trying to increase the amount we help each individual or focus on preventing the most suffering as a whole? Questions like these come up very often in charities, particularly new ones. The different directions the charities end up taking can have a large impact on their endline effectiveness. For example, a chronic problem in many health charities is the overemphasis on helping fewer individuals more. Often other poverty organizations recommend Charity Science Health to do strategies that will increase our program&#x2019;s impact on our already existing participants by 20% but at twice the cost. That same funding could have more substantial impact by reaching a larger number of beneficiaries as we scale. Although anyone can make the wrong choices on issues like these, EAs are far less likely to do so compared to typical charity entrepreneurs. In addition to this, EAs are more likely to hire other staff members who also think this way. For example, even my non-EA team members are more focused on cost-effectiveness than the average NGO employee. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>EAs will often have better networks and resources</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>The EA community has access to a lot of resources that other charities struggle with. Things like early stage funding, social support, mentorship from others who have done similar projects, legal incubation, access to a value-aligned talent pool, and incubation programs are all very rare resources to have outside of the EA movement. Very few of these resources are field or intervention specific. For example, the help I was able to give to Fortify Health was not on the technical details of iron supplementation, but on the broad process of founding charities. This network and pool of resources is one of the things many entrepreneurs find difficult. Many nonprofits, including Charity Science and Fortify Health, would not have been able to get off the ground without this sort of support. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>EAs will often have better measurement and evaluation</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Getting team buy-in for a strong measurement and evaluation (M&amp;E) system is a tricky process. Having EAs as the leaders of the organization greatly increases the chance of having quick feedback loops and the strong M&amp;E required for a charity to be highly impactful. EAs will generally think of M&amp;E-focused systems more naturally and be more emotionally invested in applying them across their charity. EAs are far from perfect on this, but it is a stronger part of EA culture than it is of standard animal advocacy, poverty or most other charity areas&#x2019; cultures. Many might think that M&amp;E is best done by an expert who has experience at M&amp;E focused organizations, and although I think these experts are very helpful to have on a broader team, I think there are too few of them willing and able to found charities to let them close all the gaps. Often an EA charity might work best with one of these employees hired (a hire many other charities might not make) to work on it full time, with the leadership also being M&amp;E oriented. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>EAs will often be more dedicated and focused</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>By &#x201C;dedicated and focused&#x201D; I mean being focused on the endline charitable goals and objectives. EA orgs that have this focus on doing good can be more flexible in making large-scale pivots towards impact. For example, New Incentives has had several large pivots, but because the founders are focused on and dedicated to preventing suffering (as well as being highly competent), they continue to be a promising charity. If an organization doesn&#x2019;t have this dedication to the fundamental metrics, then it&#x2019;s much more likely that a change of direction will mess up its focus on the end goal. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>EAs will often have better personal ability</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>This point really comes down to what reference class you are comparing with. For example, if you compare to the baseline population of people founding charities, I expect EAs to do better than this reference class on metrics like getting into an Ivy League school. But I can see a case for drawing a much tighter reference class. EAs don&#x2019;t generally want to start charities that are merely better than average, but charities that will be among the best. The reference class of &#x201C;founders of the absolute best charities&#x201D; (e.g. those recommended by Animal Charity Evaluators or GiveWell) is much more comparable to the group of EAs I expect to be able to found charities.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>In the next section, I&#x2019;ll explore more deeply the weaknesses that EA founders have. &#xA0;</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>EAs will often be worse at having experience working and managing broadly</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>EA founders will generally be young and, importantly, have much less working and management experience than others who found charities. Although inexperienced entrepreneurs are common in tech startups, in charities it&apos;s still often people who have been working for many years. This management and general work experience is hard to teach via school or books and is often learned through personal experience. This is the biggest factor making EAs weaker founders, although I do think there are some slight mitigating factors. Small charities generally grow from a small team to a larger one instead of starting with a very large number of direct reports. EAs can hire more experienced middle management to help compensate, but even with this, there will still be a lot of rapid learning that will need to occur. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>EAs will often be worse at having experience in the field</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>This is broken out from the other category above because one could, in theory, have work experience broadly, but not experience within the specific field. I think this lack of experience is many EAs&#x2019; number one concern. Unlike the above experience, this sort of experience is very niche. Fortunately that very fact is what makes it not that difficult to acquire because the area of specialization is so narrow you can learn it fairly quickly. For example, there are only a limited number of studies on SMS vaccine reminders in the developing world. As an Executive Director your knowledge set will need to be broader than just that, but you do not need to have a masters degree in public health to work on a global health intervention. You just need to gain a very strong understanding of the very narrow area you work in. My experience has been that EAs can generally get to this level of knowledge in a matter of months, not years, as many might expect, largely because the knowledge needed ends up being more specific than expected. The other common concern people have is that they won&#x2019;t have the very local and cultural knowledge of the area. This is a fair point, but this is thinking from an individual instead of organizational perspective. You can, and should, hire local people who will be able to guide the organization on this front. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>EAs will often have worse connections within a field</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Some charities are started with heavy connections in the field, whether in the form of funders, advisors or co-founders. This network is often essential to having your charity run well. The reason I tend to rank this as less important is that I have found that it&#x2019;s fairly straightforward to build up a network in your field of interest. For example, if you send out ten emails to field experts asking to speak to them about working in the area, between six to ten will respond, and some of those will be able to connect you to more people in the field (if you ask them to) and from that your network can grow quickly. Many nonprofits are quite happy to talk to others in the field and some of these contacts will end up being advisors and board members long term. I think that people generally expect that not many people will respond to a cold email, but unless the person is fairly famous, I have found that nonprofit people are very willing to do a quick Skype session. However, this approach does require more social skills than the slow build of working in a field for years.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>EAs will often be worse at having a related degree</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>I think this factor is far less important for founding a charity than many others think it is. The domain-specific knowledge gained through a degree is less important than one might believe, for the same reasons given in the section on experience within a field. And as for &#xA0;the reputational benefits of a degree, it&apos;s quite easy to hire a communication director or other staff members with degrees that provide that reputation, and in general this reputation will often quickly be overshadowed by the success of your charity. Think about top EA charities: how many of their founders have degrees in relevant fields? How many do you even know this information for? If you become very knowledgeable in a field, people are usually happy to talk to you and may often assume you have a degree based on your knowledge. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>EAs will often be worse at personal attachment to the cause</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>This is the least important factor. Being personally attached to a cause area has the benefit of giving you more motivation for that cause area, but it also has the potential to cloud your judgement and lead to worse decision making. &#xA0;</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Overall, choosing good interventions and having good connections and resources overwhelm counter considerations, which are often less of a problem than anticipated, or can be overcome with intelligent effort or hiring. When considering these factors and the track record of EA-minded people starting strong charities, I think that this is a strong career path for EAs. </span></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Joey"}}, {"_id": "qxBfbwStHfA4Qfe5A", "title": "Three levels of cause prioritisation", "postedAt": "2018-05-28T07:26:32.333Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>One of the main goals of Effective Altruism is to&#xA0;persuade people to think more deeply about how to prioritise causes. This naturally leads us to ask, &quot;What is meant by cause prioritisation?&quot; and &quot;Which aspect of cause prioritisation is most important?&quot;.<br><br>(Epistemic status: Speculative, Rough framework, see <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wDP4ZWYLNj7MGXWiW/in-praise-of-fake-frameworks\">In Praise of Fake Frameworks</a>)</p>\n<p>I&apos;d suggest that we can divide cause prioritisation into three main levels. This won&apos;t be particularly neat as we could debate exact categorisations, but it&apos;ll suffice for my purposes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>High-level causes: Global poverty, Domestic Poverty, Animal suffering, Existential risk,&#xA0;Scientific Research</li>\n<li>Specific causes: Cancer, Malaria, Factory Farming&#xA0;</li>\n<li>Interventions: Distributing bednets, Developing clean meat, Banning autonomous weapons</li>\n</ul>\n<p>An intervention is&#xA0;a solution to a given problem. For example, distributing bednets is a solution to the problem of Malaria.&#xA0;People often don&apos;t have attachments to particular interventions, but, even if they do, they are often willing to consider that another intervention might work better.</p>\n<p>Specific&#xA0;causes are the level that most charities operate on. For example, the Cancer Council researches cancer and the Against Malaria Foundation seeks to treat malaria.&#xA0;Many altruistic people have a strong emotional&#xA0;attachment to one or more specific causes.</p>\n<p>High-level causes are broad categorisations. Trying to prioritise at this level of require often requires philosophy - ie. Do we have any special duties to our fellow compatriots or is this irrelevant? Philosophy is simply not something humans are particularly skilled at discussing.&#xA0;Almost everyone who is altruistic has an attachment at this level and it is often very hard to persuade people to seriously reconsider their views.</p>\n<p>I suspect that&#xA0;attempting to persuade people to prioritise causes&#xA0;within a higher level can often be a mistake if they don&apos;t already accept that you should prioritise within the lower cause level. Emotions play a very strong role in the beliefs that people adopt and we need to think carefully about how to navigate them. Indeed,&#xA0;discussing prioritisation at too high a level&#xA0;[innoculating](https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/aYX6s8SYuTNaM2jh3/idea-inoculation-inferential-distance) them against lower levels that they would accept if presented. Further, as soon as we&apos;ve persuaded someone on a lower level, we&apos;ve established a foothold that could later be used to attempt to persuade them further. We&apos;ve reduced the inferential distance: instead of having to persuade them that we should prioritise&#xA0;charitable donations and that we should apply this principle rather radically, we only have to convince them of the later. And I suspect that this will be much easier.</p>\n<p>If we want to grow the effective altruism movement, we will have to become skilled in persuasion. A large part of this is understanding how people think so that we can avoid trigger emotions that would interfere with their reasoning. I hope that&#xA0;my suggestion of focusing on the lower levels first will help with this.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "casebash"}}, {"_id": "i3SBTvPuqkXgrBdAv", "title": "Why Groups Should Consider Direct Work", "postedAt": "2018-05-27T20:37:57.821Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><h2>&#xA0;</h2>\n<p><span> <img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/y14e43Z.png?1\" alt=\"LEAN Logo\"> </span></p>\n<p><span>It has been argued that it is strategically optimal for EA groups to focus on community building rather than direct work [1]</span><span>. The rationale behind this approach is very sensible, drawing attention to the comparative advantage that groups (university groups especially) ostensibly have to specialise in community building. Meanwhile, it is thought that many groups don&#x2019;t have the time, expertise or funding to deliver high-quality direct work or to take on the most pressing interventions. Furthermore, EA organisations typically have a need for funding and full time dedicated staff, rather than dispersed, part-time volunteers. </span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>However, there are a number of exceptions and limitations to this premise, as well as considerations that it overlooks. In recent months, the LEAN team has been approached by groups struggling to engage and retain members. As direct work may have the potential to attract and engage members, it seems valuable to revisit this policy and open it up for discussion.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>In the first part of this article, I lay out considerations that may have been overlooked or wrongly dismissed, in order to illustrate the potential value to some groups of incorporating direct work into their strategy under certain conditions. I discuss the importance of tangible actions for drawing a certain subset of high-potential individuals into rewarding and ongoing engagement with EA. From there, I move on to assess the most relevant counterfactuals to emphasise, in order to discern the best course of action with respect to this topic. A forthcoming article will focus on heuristics for enabling groups to identify their comparative advantage and a practical pathway for those considering the possibility of engaging in direct work.</span></p>\n<h2><span>The challenge of member retention</span></h2>\n<p><span>It is possible to argue that, for the sake of the EA movement, direct work should be &#x2018;left to the professionals&#x2019;, and that a significant concentration of resources and skill is needed to guarantee the quality and success of worthwhile interventions. I believe, however, that this perspective, when promoted as a general principle, tends to overlook two critical factors:</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>The first involves the mechanism through which groups retain and incubate talent for the EA movement. We know from the</span><span> 2017 LEAN Impact Assessment</span><span> [2] that many groups struggle to retain members. This was remarked upon by several of the organisers interviewed:</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>&#x201C;I think around the world this is a common problem, that after people get involved in EA, there&#x2019;s not many things to do or to keep them interested.&#x201D;</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>&#x201C;We got a lot of young professionals and students, and some young professionals really liked the ideas. But because we don&#x2019;t have anything concrete for them to engage in this, it&#x2019;s a really big gap for them to engage in the community.&#x201D;</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span><span>&#x201C;All we can offer people who want to join the club is that we have a space to meet interesting people and have good conversation. But it&#x2019;s not directly beneficial to your life, in that way. So even people who want to be effective altruists and want to be more involved often find that they have other commitments.&#x201D;</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>The assessment [3] suggested that EA groups act to amplify the impact of individuals. In particular it found that 617 active commitments came about as a result of group participation (for example, lifestyle changes, consumption changes and similar), while 227 counterfactual GWWC pledges were influenced and 517 career choices were impacted. Moreover, groups in 2017 produced over $50,000 USD for effective charities through collective fundraising, and they estimated a shifting of over $700,000 USD in private donations to effective charities.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Further to this, individuals and organisers perceived groups as offering positive effects upon value alignment and EA retention. For example, </span><span>217 respondents of the 2017 EA Survey attributed groups as counterfactually significant in leading them to become involved in EA [4]. The majority of 2017 Local Group Survey respondents deemed involvement in their groups to form a large or very large factor of their involvement in EA. Meanwhile, over 70% of respondents believed that they would have greater social impact in the future as a result of changes in beliefs or perspectives brought about through group participation.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Despite these facts, many organisers reported that some EAs were disinclined to be involved with groups because they wanted more active options than those on offer</span><span>. See, for instance, the following examples from </span><span>our interviews [5]:</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>&#x201C;People will say &#x201C;well great, this sounds like a good idea but what is there to actually do?&#x201D; It&#x2019;s just a small community of people that are interested. And I think what&#x2019;s tricky is that people don&#x2019;t really see what they get from joining. It&#x2019;s like &#x201C;ok great, I like this idea - I&#x2019;ll read the materials, but why do I need to come?&#x201D; kind of thing&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve been getting messages from people wanting to be involved in the club and actually do stuff. But the stuff we do is more, you know, host meetings, talk about stuff, get speakers, or talk about donations&#x2026;&#x201D;</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>&#x201C;We look for ways of generating appeal, and I think the prioritization project and influence over a budget was helpful for that. But since we&#x2019;re largely focused around meeting weekly and discussing philosophical issues it&#x2019;s not always as prestigious as joining something else with more to offer.&#x201D;</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>&#x201C;There are people that want to talk about weird stuff and ethical paradoxes and then there are people saying &#x2018;lets do something tangible as a group&#x2019;, and so I&#x2019;ve been struggling to figure out how to make everyone happy.&#x201D;</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Optimistically, some of the individuals that groups fail to retain are engaging with EA independently and privately, e.g. via donations or changes in career path. However, we should assume that many other talented individuals are exposed to EA ideas through a group, but do not necessarily go on to donate or alter their careers in the long run, even if they initially intend to do so.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>In addition to the reports of organisers shared above, there also seem to be several straightforward reasons why direct work could be expected to secure higher retention by EA groups, and for the EA movement by extension. </span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Considering the example of university groups, we know that talented undergraduates are at a point in life where they are relatively cash poor, but often relatively flexible in terms of time availability. Undergraduates are also at a stage in life where they are especially receptive to new ideas, and are embedded in a social and institutional context which actively encourages them to be so. Furthermore, competitive undergraduates have a mind towards their future and are on the lookout for opportunities to improve their career capital. So what happens to an undergraduate who encounters EA at university? For most of these, opportunities to actively </span><span>apply </span><span>EA are fairly limited. They might donate their birthdays to fundraise for an EA charity, join the committees of their University group, assist in event organisation and outreach, or make one-off major adjustments. For example, they might take the GWWC pledge, reorient their career trajectory or transition to veganism. However, for many, this won&#x2019;t be enough to engage their interest and inspire them to commit free time to participating in a group. As even the most sincere and well intentioned individuals are susceptible to value drift, </span><span>as illustrated recently by Joey Savoie [6], this is a serious concern. It therefore seems prudent to adopt a psychological model of EAs that better reflects reality. </span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>It would be challenging to survey individuals who stopped participating in EA groups after a few events, but we were able to gather some helpful feedback from existing group members during the </span><span>Local Group Survey in 2017 [7]. When asked &#x201C;</span><span>In what way could the group provide more value to you?</span><span>&#x201D;, a few of the submissions expressed the following wishes: </span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>&#x201C;Do something to increase the utility of the world, besides ourselves&#x201D;</span></p>\n<p><span>&#x201C;More social events and more direct impact (rather than indirect, like spreading awareness and getting pledges).&#x201D;</span></p>\n<p><span>&#x201C;More engagement with various cause areas and people working on them. People are concerned with things like animal welfare, eliminating diseases and existential risk. But aside from directing donations to them and changing personal consumption habits, the focus feels &#x2018;mostly academic&#x2019;.&#x201D;</span></p>\n<p><span>&#x201C;More effective work and projects&#x201D;</span></p>\n<p><span>&#x201C;More activism and campaign oriented work&#x201D;</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>As previously mentioned, there is also no guarantee that once members (or would-be members) graduate and move on from this initial engagement that they will adhere to their pledges and donation goals, even if they were inspired to make a change of this kind at that time. Many morally-minded intelligent people are attracted by immediate opportunities to use their skills to create tangible change. If people such as this are given engaging opportunities at this critical stage, then chances are significantly higher that they will remain plugged into the community, and value-aligned.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>This holds true for non-student local groups also. Even if a group made up of professionals succeeds in securing donations and inspiring people to earn to give, it is also likely to have some members that are more attracted by tangible opportunities. (While specific actions will be addressed in a later post, for the sake of clarity, tangible opportunities that come to mind include volunteering, adcocacy, fundraising and undertaking research.) Indeed, this preference might be even more pronounced amongst professional EAs who typically have less disposable time than students, and are more likely to be embedded in family commitments and full time work. Individuals in this category might prefer to invest time only in activities with concrete material outcomes, in contrast to purely discussion based and social activities. One notable finding from the EA Survey 2017 data &#xA0;was that EA students were almost twice as likely to be in groups as non-student EAs were. For many professional EAs, it may not make any sense in their trajectory to switch careers, but they still might need the inspiration and fulfilment that direct action offers, in order to remain motivated to give. In such cases opportunities for direct action are may promote continued value alignment.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>It is worth noting, at this juncture, that 57 of the Local Group Survey respondents in 2017 were from local groups, where 37 hailed from university groups. This makes it vitally important to consider the retention and preferences of professionals in addition to students, when forming movement level group strategy.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Overall then, if we discourage groups from engaging in direct work, we choose to accept the loss or distancing of many highly talented persons with significant potential. </span></p>\n<h2><span>Which counterfactual is the best fit?</span></h2>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>This brings me to the second of the two factors that are unduly overlooked. That is the issue of choosing the right counterfactual. The maxim that EA groups should abstain from direct work in favour of community building is a conclusion that appears to take for granted that groups and their members are equally willing and able to do one or the other. If group members were likely to redirect each hour of time they would have offered to direct work to community building, this suggestion might well be appropriate</span><span>. However, people who are motivated to offer their spare time to direct work might be turned cold by community building activities. In this case, the hours of labour and skill on offer might very well be lost entirely, if direct action was not on the cards.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>This is an alarming consideration, especially if we factor in the numerous professional EAs who might want to volunteer a few hours of their week to direct work, but who should not switch from their careers to working full time for an existing organisation. In cases such as these, the skill and experience of these group members may very well be wasted on simple outreach or community building pursuits. In other words, it seems very likely that for a number of individuals the choice is not between community building and direct work, but rather between direct work and nothing, or direct EA work and some other competing opportunity such as involvement in a different charitable community or society. </span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>An infrequent but still important counterfactual that must be addressed is that of groups who would be significantly restricted, or lose out on impactful opportunities unless they engaged in direct action. A few such cases emerged during </span><span>LEAN&apos;s group leader interviews in 2017 [8]. For these groups, &#x2018;bread and butter&#x2019; EA group actions are either not feasible or unlikely to be effective because of the specificity of their cultural and regional context. The same may be true of a focus on donations, particularly for a group operating in a third world country. Some groups encounter regulatory censorship, and certain cultures and communities have an even stronger insistence upon domestic charity. Groups such as these are often inspired to reinvent the wheel and engage in sophisticated strategy that may involve actions such as diplomacy, advocacy and context tailored interventions.</span><span> Recent examples include local groups like EA Delhi, hoping to work on regionally specific donation recommendations in light of the unique philanthropic market in the country, </span><span>and a different group [9]</span><span> which has the opportunity to redirect significant donations institutionalised within a particular religious network as long as it can reframe and prioritise strategic angles of EA thought.</span></p>\n<p><span> &#xA0;</span></p>\n<p><span>Of course it is also important to consider counterfactuals less favourable to my argument. In theory, engaging in direct action could result in a loss of time that an EA might have better spent on career building efforts, as illustrated in </span><span>Thomas Sittler&apos;s retrospective [9] on the Oxford Prioritisation Project. While diversion of this kind does not strike me as unlikely, it does strike me as less damaging in overall effect when compared to the risk of talented EAs drifting away from EA entirely. An already engaged EA will likely still have learned from any misguided or inefficient activities. If the activity in question is not highly successful, those executing the activity will still be building lasting experiences of value in areas such as leadership and project management. Meanwhile, failed retention of would-be EAs is more permanent, enduring and expansive with respect to the costs that are incurred by the movement.</span></p>\n<h2><span>What if the direct work is low-value?</span></h2>\n<p><span>Realigning our counterfactuals alters how we view the utility of direct work engaged in by groups. Instead of looking at how valuable direct work in this context will be in itself, we should also ask what value it will offer to the meta-level goals of attracting, retaining and incubating talent to the movement. Returning again to the Local Group Survey data of 2017, we asked members to share their plans for impact and to tell us how they believed the EA community could best support them in their goals.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>&#x201C;It would be helpful if EA orgs were willing to give our group consulting tasks that we could use as a learning opportunity&#x201D;</span></p>\n<p><span>&#x201C;More resources about effective project work&#x201D;</span></p>\n<p><span>&#x201C;Helping NGOs in my country measure their impact and make it bigger&#x201D;</span></p>\n<p><span>&#x201C;Help me find impactful volunteer opportunities&#x201D;</span></p>\n<p><span>&#x201C;EA Global should consider empowering individual EAs working in government and government-adjacent institutions, with specific tools and networking opportunities to facilitate policy advocacy&#x201D;</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Replies of this kind made it clear that there is a significant need in the movement for an intermediary space between formalised roles such as internships or jobs that empower talented and ambitious altruists to upskill and make strides towards the impact they are best suited to deliver in the long term. Clearly then, the value of direct work in this context is broader than that of the action itself. </span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>It is also worth a reminder, at this junction, that direct work organised at the group level can be highly impactful, as evinced by the aforementioned amount of funds collectively raised for effective charities by a small number of groups last year.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Nevertheless one might reasonably question this value calculus if one has concerns that direct action on the part of groups might be not merely ineffectual but actively harmful. The risk of this outcome seems very low to me for a number of reasons. </span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>First of all, there are exceedingly few groups in the network engaging in direct work. This suggests that, for the time being at least, we are highly unlikely to witness an uncontrolled explosion of altruistic interventions by groups, for good or for bad. </span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Furthermore, we tend to see those groups who do pioneer and initiate charitable projects reaching out to the EA community for informational and material support. This is because groups are not typically independently blessed with the funds, connections and expertise to launch interventions prior to networking. The impetus to network means that groups spontaneously integrate with the global EA community. This connection, and the support that the central community brings with it an element of influence and accountability, which safeguards against misguided ventures.</span></p>\n<h1><span>Conclusion</span></h1>\n<p><span>Altogether it seems very likely that a blanket policy discouraging groups from engaging in direct work will cost the movement a significant amount of hours in terms of the labour and skill that EAs around the world are inspired to offer. Not only is this negative for straightforward reasons, but this &#x2018;waste&#x2019; brings with it a substantial risk to retention. This warrants an investigation into whether or not it is worthwhile to encourage groups to take on opportunities for action where applicable. Available group actions may fall short of embodying the very highest impact intervention that humans could take, but might instead still constitute the highest impact intervention that the group in question could deliver. Even if the gains from such projects might be small, they would be multiplied by the long-term returns in members retained, hours of good performed, and in the fostering of skill. A talented group member who cuts their teeth on a small scale, modest project may be much more likely and able to transition to higher impact responsibilities in the future. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>In a future article, I will suggest ways that organisers can identify the comparative advantage particular to their group, and share examples of successful direct actions taken by present and past groups.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h1><span>Endnotes</span></h1>\n<p><span><span>[1] https://app.effectivealtruism.org/groups/resources/effective-altruism-community-building</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>[2] http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1l7/2017_lean_impact_assessment_evaluation_strategic/</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>[3] </span><span>http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1ic</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>[4] https://rtcharity.org/ea-survey-2017-part-8/</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>[5] http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1jb/2017_lean_impact_assessment_qualitative_findings/</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>[6] http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1ne/empirical_data_on_value_drift/</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>[7] </span><span>http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1ic.

The benefit of the project is <em>x</em>. Each of the organisations is a necessary condition of the benefit x. The counterfactual impact of A is <em>x</em>; the counterfactual impact of B is <em>x</em>; etc. Despite this, the counterfactual impact of A, B, C, and D acting together is not 4*<em>x</em>, rather it is <em>x</em>. This seems paradoxical but isn&#x2019;t. This is relevant in numerous ways to EAs.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Cross-posted from my <a href=\"http://johnhalstead.org/index.php/2018/05/27/the-counterfactual-impact-of-agents-acting-in-concert/\">blog</a>.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Much of the time when organisations are working to produce some positive outcome, no single organisations would have produced the benefit acting on their own. Usually, organisations work in concert to achieve valuable outcomes and in many cases the outcome would not have been produced if some of the organisations taken individually had not acted as they did. This is a particularly pervasive feature of policy advocacy and EA advocacy. This gives rise to apparent paradoxes in the assessment of counterfactual impact.</p>\n<p>For example, suppose Victoria hears about EA through GWWC and wouldn&#x2019;t have heard about it otherwise. She makes the pledge and gives $1m to ACE charities, which she wouldn&#x2019;t have found otherwise (and otherwise would have donated to a non-effective animal charity let&#x2019;s suppose). Who counterfactually produced the $1m donation benefit: Victoria, GWWC or ACE? Each of them is a necessary condition for the benefit: if Victoria hadn&#x2019;t acted, then the $1m wouldn&#x2019;t have been donated; if GWWC hadn&#x2019;t existed, then the $1m wouldn&#x2019;t have been donated; and if ACE hadn&#x2019;t existed then the $1m wouldn&#x2019;t have been donated effectively. Therefore, Victoria&#x2019;s counterfactual impact is $1m to effective charities, GWWC&#x2019;s counterfactual impact is $1m to effective charities, and ACE&#x2019;s impact is $1m to effective charities.</p>\n<p>Apparent paradox: doesn&#x2019;t this entail that the aggregate counterfactual impact of Victoria, GWWC and ACE is $3m to effective charities? No. When we are assessing the counterfactual impact of Victoria, GWWC and ACE acting together, we now ask a different question to the one we asked above viz. &#x201C;if Victoria, GWWC and ACE had not acted, what benefit would there have been?&#x201D;. This is a different question and so gets a different answer: $1m. The difference is that when we are assessing the counterfactual impact of Victoria acting, the counterfactual worlds we compare are</p>\n<p>Actual World: Victoria, GWWC, and ACE all act.</p>\n<p>Counterfactual world (Victoria): Victoria doesn&#x2019;t act, GWWC and ACE act as they would have done if Victoria had not acted.</p>\n<p>The benefits in the Actual World are +$1bn compared to the Counterfactual World (Victoria). We take the same approach for each actor, changing what needs to be changed. In contrast, when assessing the <em>collective</em> counterfactual impact of the actors, we ask:</p>\n<p>Actual World: Victoria, GWWC, and ACE all act.</p>\n<p>Counterfactual world (Victoria+GWWC+ACE): Victoria, GWWC and ACE don&#x2019;t act.</p>\n<p>When multiple actors are each a necessary condition for some outcome, it is inappropriate to sum the counterfactual impact of actors <em>taken individually</em> to produce an estimate of the <em>collective</em> counterfactual impact of the actors.</p>\n<p>[Edit: adding this to further clarify the point, as maybe the point wasn&apos;t clear enough.]</p>\n<p>To assess Vic&apos;s counterfactual impact, we compare to the world in which <em>Vic doesn&apos;t act, and GWWC and ACE act as they would have done had Vic not acted</em>.</p>\n<p>To assess GWWC&apos;s counterfactual impact we compare to the world in which <em>GWWC doesn&apos;t exist, and ACE and Vic act as they would have done had GWWC not existed</em>.</p>\n<p>To assess ACE&apos;s counterfactual impact, we compare to the world in which <em>ACE doesn&apos;t exist, and</em>&#xA0;<em>GWWC and Vic act as they would have done had ACE not existed.&#xA0;</em></p>\n<p>This is the correct way to assess these agents&apos; counterfactual impact. <strong>The principle that we can aggregate them is wrong and so the absurd conclusion about their collective impact that follows is not a reductio of that method of measuring counterfactual impact. The absurd conclusion is a reductio of the aggregation principle.</strong>&#xA0;We cannot aggregate the counterfactual impact taken individually because then we would be comparing the actual world to the world in which &quot;<em>Vic doesn&apos;t act, and GWWC and ACE act as they would have done had Vic not acted, AND&#xA0;</em><em>GWWC doesn&apos;t exist, and ACE and Vic act as they would have done had GWWC not existed, AND ACE doesn&apos;t eixst&#xA0;</em><em>GWWC and Vic act as they would have done had ACE not existed&quot;.&#xA0;</em>This condition does not describe the relevant counterfactual world - if Vic had not acted, then GWWC and ACE would still have existed, but according to this proposition GWWC and ACE do not exist. The problem is the aggregation principle, not the method of estimating counterfactual impact.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Applications</strong></p>\n<p><em>Voting</em></p>\n<p>This has obvious applications when assessing the social benefits of voting. Suppose that there is an election and Politician A would produce $10bn in benefit compared to Politician B. The election is decided by one vote. (For simplicity suppose that B wins if there is a tie.) Emma cast a decisive vote for option A and therefore her counterfactual impact is $10bn. It is correct to say that the counterfactual impact of each other A voter is also $10bn.</p>\n<p>The alternative approach (which I argue is wrong) is to say that each of the <em>n</em> A voters is counterfactually responsible for 1/<em>n</em> of the $10bn benefit. Suppose there are 10m A voters. Then each A voter&#x2019;s counterfactual social impact is 1/10m*$10bn = $1000. But on this approach the common EA view that it is rational for individuals to vote as long as the probability of being decisive is not too small, is wrong. Suppose the ex ante chance of being decisive is 1/1m. Then the expected value of Emma voting is a mere 1/1m*$1000 = $0.001. On the correct approach, the expected value of Emma voting is 1/10m*$10bn = $1000. If voting takes 5 minutes, this is obviously a worthwhile investment for the benevolent voter, as per common EA wisdom.</p>\n<p><em>Assessing the impact of EA organisations</em></p>\n<p>When evaluating their own impact, EA organisations will often face this issue. Community orgs like CEA, REG, and Founders Pledge will recruit new donors who donate to charities recommended by GiveWell, ACE and others. How do we calculate the counterfactual impact here? If I am right, in the manner above. This does mean we should be careful when making claims about the collective impact of EA as a whole movement. It would be a mistake to aggregate the counterfactual impact of all the EA orgs taken one by one.</p>\n<p><em>Assessing the impact of policy organisations</em></p>\n<p>For most policy advocacy campaigns, numerous actors are involved and in some cases numerous organisations will be a necessary condition for some particular policy change. Notwithstanding difficulties in finding out which actors actually were necessary conditions, their counterfactual impact should be calculated as per the above methodology.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>A note of caution: leveraging and funging</strong><a title=\"\" href=\"file:///C:/Users/Admin/Google%20Drive/EA%20blogs/The%20counterfactual%20impact%20of%20agents%20acting%20in%20concert.docx#_ftn1\"><span><strong><span><span><!-- [if !supportFootnotes]--><span><strong><span>[1]</span></strong></span><!--[endif]--></span></span></strong></span></a></p>\n<p>The approach I have outlined needs to be applied with care. Most importantly, we need to be careful not to confuse the following two counterfactual comparisons:</p>\n<p><em>Comparison 1 (correct)</em></p>\n<p>Actual World: A, B, and C all act.</p>\n<p>Counterfactual world (A): A doesn&#x2019;t act, B and C act <em>as they would have done if A had not acted</em>.</p>\n<p><em>Comparison 2 (incorrect)</em></p>\n<p>Actual World: A, B, and C all act.</p>\n<p>Counterfactual world (A): A doesn&#x2019;t act, <em>B and C act as they did in the actual world</em>.</p>\n<p>Confusing these two comparisons can lead one to neglect <em>leveraging</em> and <em>funging</em> effects. Organisations can <em>leverage</em> funds from other actors into a particular project. Suppose that AMF will spend $1m on a net distribution. As a result of AMF&#x2019;s commitment, the Gates Foundation contributes $400,000. If AMF had not acted, Gates would have spent the $400,000 on something else. Therefore, the counterfactual impact of AMF&#x2019;s work is:</p>\n<p>AMF&#x2019;s own $1m on bednets <em>plus</em> Gates&#x2019; $400,000 on bednets <em>minus</em> the benefits of what Gates would otherwise have spent their $400,000 on.</p>\n<p>If Gates would otherwise have spent the money on something worse than bednets, then the leveraging is beneficial; if they would otherwise have spent it on something better than bednets, the leveraging reduces the benefit produced by AMF.</p>\n<p>Confusing the two comparisons can also lead us to neglect <em>funging</em> effects. Suppose again that AMF commits $1m to a net distribution. But if AMF had put nothing in, DFID would instead have committed $500,000 to the net distribution. In this case, AMF funges with DFID.

They had to calculate, estimate, and publish the number of deaths caused by different diseases. These numbers influenced several things, from government spending on treatment programs, to the public perception of progress being made on different issues. However, even though the people doing the calculations were well-meaning and generally competent, there was a big problem. There was no oversight and the process lacked consistency, meaning that each WHO group used different methods, calculations, and assumptions. This resulted in estimates double- and triple-counting a single death. </p><p>This mis-estimation was potentially fatal, with funding and intellectual resources being devoted towards certain diseases over other, more important areas. A concerned staff member at the WHO noticed the problem after discovering that by adding up the four biggest killers (malaria, diarrhea, TB, and measles) in a lower income country, this added up to more than 100% of the total number of deaths in that country, and that was not even counting all other causes of death. When the employee brought up the concern with coworkers and management, it was largely dismissed. It would have looked bad, both for the individual groups and the WHO as a whole, to admit or address such a large mistake. Even after the staff member triple-checked his work and strengthened it\u00a0through deeper research, it went unheard. The unspoken rule was: don\u2019t embarrass the higher-ups. </p><p>The end line result was the founding of a completely new project outside of the WHO- the Global Burden of Disease Study- which measured impact correctly, did not double or triple count deaths, and which is, in fact, used to this day by groups like GiveWell, the Gates Foundation, and many others.</p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>This is a true story, paraphrased from <a href=\"https://www.amazon.ca/Epic-Measures-Doctor-Billion-Patients/dp/0062237500\">Epic Measures</a>, and it highlights one of my biggest concerns about the EA movement. Trying to calculate counterfactual impact is a very hard task and much like with the WHO numbers, not only is each EA organization using different systems, they each have an incentive to publish high impact results. With impact, the calculations are even harder to do correctly than in the case of deaths, as it is often plausible that five different people or organizations were required for an action to happen. Sadly, if each of the five take 100% credit, you will end up with the EA movement as a whole taking 500% credit for a given action. </p><p>This can also happen with donations. It would be very easy for an EA to find out about EA from Charity Science, to read blog posts from both GWWC and TLYCS, sign up for both pledges, and then donate directly to GiveWell (who would count this impact again). This person would become quadruple counted in EA, with each organization using their donations as impact to justify their running. The problem is that, at the end of the day, if the person donated $1000, TLYCS, GWWC, GiveWell, and Charity Science may each have spent $500 on programs for getting this person into the movement/donating. Each organization would proudly report they have 2:1 ratios and give themselves a pat on the back, when really the EA movement as a whole just spent $2000 for $1000 worth of donations. </p><p>The previous example used donations because it\u2019s easy and clear cut to make the case that this is the wrong move without getting into more difficult issues, but it generalizes to talent as well. For example, recently, <a href=\"http://www.fortifyhealth.global/\">Fortify Health</a> was founded. Clearly the founders deserve 100% impact- without them, the project certainly would not have happened. But wait a second: both of them think that without Charity Science\u2019s support, the project would definitely not have happened. So, technically, Charity Science could also take 100% credit. (Since from our perspective, if we did not help Fortify Health it would not have happened, so it is a 100% counterfactually caused by Charity Science project). But wait a second, what about the donors who funded the project early on (because of Charity Science\u2019s recommendation)? Surely they deserve some credit for impact as well! What about the fact that without the EA movement, it would have been much less likely for Charity Science and Fortify Health to connect? </p><p>With multiple organizations and individuals, you can very easily attribute a lot more impact than actually happens. \u00a0A project\u2019s evaluation could easily create the perception of x4 the impact it really had. This is even more likely, if it&#x27;s unclear where people are taking their credit for impact from (e.g. I might publish a report on Charity Science&#x27;s overall impact with \u201csupporting new charities\u201d impact listed, but not specify on the exact help I gave or how many others were involved). This is not even talking about deliberate rounding or naive overestimation of the value of that project. </p><p>Sadly, all these issues occur even with everyone trying to be as honest and careful as they can be. To jump back to the financial example, you can imagine Charity Science, GWWC and TLYCS not knowing exactly how much the person who donates $1000 is actually donating, leading to different and often over optimistic estimates across the organization. </p><h1>The solutions</h1><p>Sadly, I cannot think of a silver bullet solution. Thankfully, though, I think there are some things that can really help. </p><h2>Transparent sharing of data regarding impact and the methodology to calculate impact \u00a0</h2><p>Mistakes like this are much more likely to happen the less clear and transparent the causal chain of impact is. Many organizations have internal counterfactual calculations, but it\u2019s hard for donors or other organizations to make sense of the end line data without knowing how it was, in fact, estimated. Obviously, not all data is going to be shareable (e.g. the names of the people donating). However, the process for calculating impact can be shared and compared, which, in turn, can allow for an open discussion of these issues (e.g. how to disaggregate the impact of two organizations taking similar actions.) It also gives the community a chance to sanity check each other\u2019s numbers. If Charity Science was massively over-estimating something relative to external observers, it would be hard for them to point out this flaw without a high level of transparency. </p><h2>Efforts towards a consistent evaluation process between organizations</h2><p>The more similar the process that is used between organizations, the easier it would be to take seriously the end line numbers. Something like this could be coordinated on the EA Forum and could clear up a lot of confusion regarding impact evaluation. (For example, if I hire someone to Charity Science, does that count as a career change?) I think that current organizations have very different intuitions and processes, and thus, end line numbers. I also think that to increase consistency, donors should insist upon seeing the data before donating to an organization.</p><h2>Independent unbiased external impact analysis</h2><p>The solution to the WHO problem was not just more interdepartmental coordination and transparency. It was, in fact, independent external analysis. Although I think this is \u201cthe solution\u201d, it&#x27;s easily the hardest to execute well. The results from something like this would a) be very sensitive to the evaluators\u2019 values (e.g. if they valued one cause a lot more than another, it would be hard to generalize), b) be very time consuming (I expect it would take many hours to get a strong understanding of all the aspects of an organization; likely months to years of full time work), c) would require a fairly unprecedented level of transparency in the charity world. </p><p>Things like this can happen. I think GiveWell\u2019s external reviewing of poverty charities is a good example of something pretty close to the ideal, and I think it would allow for much stronger evaluation and accountability when considering and comparing the impacts of different organizations. \u00a0\u00a0</p>", "user": {"username": "Joey"}}, {"_id": "SYymYwgT89wcZBPYr", "title": "Expected cost per life saved of the TAME trial", "postedAt": "2018-05-26T09:34:36.046Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>September 2019 update:</strong> the TAME trial has been funded.

I found some of Turchin\u2019s assumptions were unnecessary or unjustified. He did not provide an expected value calculation and\u00a0he did not\u00a0apply the necessary discounts. His figure is true only if some of his many assumptions are, and this led to a result that I thought to be many orders of magnitudes off: $0.24 per life saved. In reality, if you scroll down to the <a href=\"about:blank#Calculation\">Calculation</a> section, you can see that, accounting for the icebreaking effect of the TAME trial on the FDA, I came to a result that is not distant to Turchin\u2019s. This happened because Turchin did not\u00a0account for the icebreaking effect, compensating the\u00a0omission of the discounts. Otherwise, If the icebreaking effect is disregarded, the results are different, yet still show high cost-effectiveness. Again, you can find those results in the Calculation section. In <a href=\"about:blank#the_last\">the last section</a> I outlined future directions and strategies that could be helpful to evaluate potentially much greater opportunities in the field of aging research.</p><p>Writing this analysis was challenging and some parameters remain somewhat subjective. It\u2019s possible I made some mistakes, so I will present the calculation in a way that makes it easier to change values and redo it. If you find mistakes or make other important observations, please comment and I\u2019ll modify the post as soon as possible. In general I tried to proceed in a similar way to how <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models\">GiveWell\u2019s CEAs</a>\u00a0[<a href=\"about:blank#1\">1</a>] are made.</p><p>The TAME (Targeting Aging With Metformin) trial is motivated by two reasons:</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://www.afar.org/natgeo/\">According to\u00a0AFAR</a> [<a href=\"about:blank#2\">2</a>], the TAME trial could have an icebreaking effect on the FDA. It will:\u00a0<br/> [...] pave the way for the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to consider aging a modifiable condition and an official \u201cindication\u201d for which treatments can be developed and approved. This could lead to increased funding and research, and expanded and better drug development to target aging factors, not just specific age-related diseases and conditions. TAME can open the door to ongoing research and other drug developments that will help us all live healthier, longer.<br/> </li><li>Testing\u00a0metformin on a healthy population\u00a0could\u00a0prove\u00a0its beneficial effects (compression of\u00a0late life morbidity and life extension)\u00a0on healthy people in a definite way.\u00a0After that, the official \u201cblessing\u201d of metformin by the FDA would cause physicians to start suggesting it to their patients.\u00a0</li></ol><br/><h1>The idea</h1><p><strong>The core of Turchin\u2019s idea is right</strong>: Let\u2019s say <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longevity_escape_velocity\">Longevity Escape Velocity</a> [<a href=\"about:blank#3\">3</a>] will happen at date <strong>x</strong>. If we extend the lives of people who would have died before date <strong>x</strong>, making them reach date <strong>x</strong>, we are then \u201dsaving their lives\u201d. This could be done by raising the life expectancy of a portion of the world using simple interventions such as metformin.</p><p>The given in this rationale is that Longevity Escape Velocity will happen at some point, and I think this is very safe to assume. There is no physical law that makes Longevity Escape Velocity impossible [<a href=\"about:blank#4\">4</a>] and there are examples in nature of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biological_immortality\">negligibly senescent animals</a>.

It&#x27;s particularly relevant because of\u00a0the number of subjects and because it introduced a population without diabetes to be compared with a diabetic one:\u00a0</p><blockquote> We identified 78 241 subjects treated with metformin, 12 222 treated with sulphonylurea, and 90 463 matched subjects without diabetes. This resulted in a total, censored follow-up period of 503 384 years.<br/> </blockquote><p>It found an all cause mortality reduction in diabetics patients treated with metformin compared with a population on non diabetics:</p><blockquote> With reference to observed survival in diabetic patients initiated with metformin monotherapy [survival time ratio (STR) = 1.0], adjusted median survival time was 15% lower (STR = 0.85, 95% CI 0.81-0.90) in matched individuals without diabetes.[...]<br/> </blockquote><p>We can extrapolate\u00a0a Risk Ratio from this quote:</p><blockquote> Unadjusted event rates [...], surprisingly, were lower in those treated with metformin than in their matched controls (14.4 vs. 15.2 per 1000 person-years, respectively; p = 0.054).\u00a0<br/> </blockquote><p>This data\u00a0translates to around 1 year of more life for diabetics than the non diabetic control. The conversion from Risk Ratio to years added is explained by Gwern in <a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/Longevity\">his article</a>.</p><p>There are some considerations to make:</p><ul><li>The mean age of participants who had been given metformin was 61, and it\u2019s possible that starting earlier would make the effect greater.<br/><br/></li><li>Since diabetics lived more than the control group it\u2019s possible that healthy people would live even more, especially because non diabetic controls had less morbidity. In the study, table 1 shows that more diabetics had already been treated for disorders and had slightly worse parameters than the control group. This could mean that their life expectancy without metformin would have been worse than the one of the control group. On the other hand, at page 7 it is noted that: Due to the association between type 2 diabetes and increased cardiovascular risk, people with type 2 diabetes are more likely to be receiving exercise and lifestyle interventions and close monitoring and control of blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia are risk factors for cardiovascular disease but are generally asymptomatic. Therefore, these conditions may be less well diagnosed in the control group.\u00a0\u00a0<br/> In the study it is also noted that the control group could have more undiagnosed morbidities. In fact another interesting finding is this: When compared with matched, non-diabetic controls, diabetic patients with high co-morbidity who were treated with metformin had particularly improved survival (Charlson index \u22653: STR=0.67, 0.59\u20130.77), and this pattern increased with increasing morbidity (Figure 3). Importantly, survival was better with metformin even in those people who had not received cardiac prophylactic medications at baseline, but consistent survival benefits were observed with metformin when used in people with a prior history of each prophylactic treatment subgroup.<br/> This could be due to less undiagnosed morbidities leading to more treatment or (most probably) due to the fact that the STR, so the difference in death rates, starts to show when diabetics get older, that is the same time when their morbidity increases.<br/><br/></li><li>The study is a correlative result, although there are theories of why metformin may have beneficial effects in healthy people.

Kritchevsky, PhD. Given at the <a href=\"https://www.nia.nih.gov/research/dgcg/claude-d-pepper-older-american-independence-centers-oaics\">OAIC</a> Annual Meeting April 19, 2016) at first glance seems to support his figure, stating a 30% effect size, that would translate to around 3 years. But this effect size regards studies\u00a0looking for\u00a0the reduction\u00a0of the risk of various disorders such as cardiovascular diseases, dementia and cancer and not all cause mortality, so we can\u2019t use it in this analysis. The effect sizes of metformin\u00a0regarding various disorders have been shown to be higher than the effect size regarding all cause mortality.\u00a0Moreover\u00a0these studies were done on diabetics, not healthy people.\u00a0</li></ul><p>The first two consideration could make the 1 year figure a bit higher and the third one lower. The\u00a0last one has no effect on it. So I\u2019ll leave it at 1 year. If you are able to quantify the considerations above in an objective manner please comment.</p><br/><h3>B) Statistical power of the TAME trial: worst case = 10%, average case = 47%, best case 84%</h3><p>The objective of the TAME trial will be comparing the\u00a0risk of various morbidities among metformin&#x27;s users and non users. It will not check\u00a0for all cause mortality, so I\u2019ll take Gwern\u2019s estimate of 10% - extrapolated as if\u00a0all cause mortality was the endpoint of TAME - as a worst case, since checking for all cause mortality leads to a smaller effect size, that influences the power of the trial negatively. On the other hand, the projections in <a href=\"https://www.peppercenter.org/docs/AM2016/slides/OAIC2016_SK_TAMEtalk.pdf\">Kritchevsky\u2019s presentation</a> seem to be too optimistic. They assume at worst an effect size of 20%, and a 30% effect size as a best case. I\u2019m highly skeptical of effect sizes greater than 20%, since the studies done till now on metformin\u2019s effect on various morbidities were done on diabetics, who have already an increased risk of the morbidities studied. I\u2019ll take the 20% effect size as a best case. According to the table in the presentation, if the effect size is 20%, the statistical power could vary between 58% and 84%. I&#x27;ll take 84% as the best case. The average between 10% and 84% is 47%.\u00a0</p><br/><h3>C) Number of people dying of aging in a year near LEV: LEV in 2030: 65M, LEV in 2065: 88M, LEV in 2100s: 98M</h3><p>I expect LEV could happen somewhere between 2030 and 2100: average 2065. The later LEV happens, the more people will be dying of aging at that time, and so more would be saved by anti-aging interventions. Taking an early date for LEV makes the estimate conservative. The number of people dying of aging in 2030 will be a fraction of the number of people born around 1950. At that time the world population was <a href=\"https://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/sixbillion/sixbilpart1.pdf\">2.52 billions</a> and the crude birth rate - the total number of live births every 1,000 people in a year - was <a href=\"http://data.un.org/Data.aspx?q=world+population&d=PopDiv&f=variableID%3A53%3BcrID%3A900\">36.876</a>, so approximately 93 millions people were born. Today, aging is responsible for around <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death\">70%</a> of all deaths. If this percentage remains the same (in reality it will increase, but I will take a conservative approach), in 2030 approximately 65 millions people will die of aging. If LEV happens around 2065, then, at that time, people born in the 80s will be dying of aging. In the 80s the world population was approximately 4.5 billions and the crude birth rate was 27.863. So the number of people dying of aging in 2065 will be approximately (4,500,000,000/1000)*27.863*0.7 = 88 millions. If LEV happens in 2100, then people born today will be dying of aging at that time. Today\u2019s world population is 7.6 billions and the crude birth rate is 18.5, so the number people dying of aging in a year around 2100 will be (7,600,000,000/1000)*18.5*0.7= 98 millions.</p><br/><h3>D) Additional share of the world population who would take metformin consistently: worst case: 0.13%, average case: 1.3%, best case: 13%</h3><p>I expect that such an intervention will be implemented only among the upper-middle income and high income shares of the world population. This amounts to <a href=\"http://www.pewglobal.org/interactives/global-population-by-income/\">16% of the world population</a> although this percentage is increasing, so this is a conservative estimate. It\u00a0also has to be\u00a0taken into account that only a percentage of this population will take metformin consistently enough to benefit from it. According to the<a href=\"https://www.crnusa.org/\"> CRN</a>, in 2017, <a href=\"https://www.crnusa.org/newsroom/dietary-supplement-usage-increases-says-new-survey\">76% of the US population</a> took dietary supplements in the previous 12 months and 21% of them for healthy aging. It is also reported that 45% of those who do not take dietary supplement might consider taking them if a doctor recommended it.</p><p>About the survey:</p><blockquote> The survey was conducted between Aug. 24\u201328 by Ipsos Public Affairs and was funded by CRN. The survey was conducted online in English and included a national sample of 2,001 adults aged 18 and older living in the United States, including 1,528 among those who are considered supplement users. The survey has been conducted annually since 2000. The precision of Ipsos online polls are measured using a credibility interval. In this case, the poll has a credibility interval of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points for all respondents, and plus or minus 2.9 percentage points for supplement users (see<a href=\"https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/2017-03/IpsosPA_CredibilityIntervals.pdf\"> Ipsos\u2019 online polling methodology</a> for more info).<br/> </blockquote><p>According to the study above, a majority of the US population uses supplements, but this is not true for other developed countries, with differences in prevalence of supplements usage <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19888276\">up to tenfold</a>.</p><p>Taking all this into consideration, the share of people taking supplements for healthy aging in the world should be between 0.16*0.76*0.21/10 = 0.0025 (0.25%) and 0.16*0.76*0.21 = 0.025 (2.5%). Average 1.3%.</p><p>This variable is about how many more people do not currently take metformin but will as a result of the TAME trial. In order to improve the sense of scale about how widespread metformin currently is, I want to report a few statistics: According to the American Diabetes Association, in 2015, <a href=\"http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-basics/statistics/\">9.4% of the US</a> population had diabetes. 96% of them have type 2 diabetes and 76% were diagnosed. \u00a0<br/>In the UK, 57% of people with type 2 diabetes are treated with metformin <a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/docs/longevity/2014-bannister.pdf\">(Bannister et al., 2014, p.1)</a>. If metformin usage is similar among diabetics in the US, that means that almost 4% of the US population currently uses metformin. This is in accordance with the high number of prescriptions of this medicine in the US: 83.9 millions in 2015. The number is so\u00a0high probably because of prescription renewals and prescriptions for other conditions other than diabetes.</p><p>I want to combine all these numbers together in three possible scenarios:</p><p><strong>Worst case</strong>: In this case metformin\u2019s prescription for healthy people remains not very widespread, maybe because of side effects (although some of them can be mitigated by the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28718236\">extended release version</a>), or maybe because metformin has to be taken for multiple years in order for it to have an effect on longevity, or maybe because it will be seen as less \u201cnatural\u201d than supplements like multivitamins. In the worst case scenario, the number of healthy people taking metformin is well below the number of ill people taking metformin, and also well below the number of people taking supplements for healthy aging. There could be as much as a tenfold decrease from the 1.3% of people taking supplements for healthy aging in the world, maybe more. So 0.13% of the world population. In the US this would translate to around 0.76*0.21/10 = 0.01, so 1% of the US population, that is still a lot. I chose a correction of one order of magnitude because this percentage could mean that a minority of older people (currently 14.5% of the US population is older than 65, but in other countries like Japan and Italy the percentage is around 30%) without diabetes would get a metformin prescription, maybe in the face of risk factors for cardiovascular conditions. There would be also a minority of young healthy people taking metformin, probably a bigger share than today\u2019s self-experimenters. <br/><br/>There could be a case even worse than this, in which the TAME trial is mostly ignored by physicians and maybe a correction of two orders of magnitudes would be required. I believe this is too unlikely, and it is counterbalanced by a similar rationale for the best case, so I will not include it. The sum of the cases (even cases not included here), each multiplied by\u00a0its probability, is probably very close to the average case.</p><p><strong>Average case</strong>: In this case the negative considerations of the worst case are compensated by the positive ones in the best case. Or simply metformin becomes one supplement used for healthy aging like any other today. In this case its usage in the world would be around 1.3%, as calculated earlier.</p><p><strong>Best case</strong>: In this case metformin becomes really widespread thanks to all the media attention it gets. This is partly believable, because a surge of media attention for aging research and interventions is to be expected in the next decades: This will occur when the basic science and the clinical trials being done today, not only for metformin, will translate into something available for the public. At that point, medicine against aging could be one of the most widely discussed topics in public discourse. Supplement usage in general could also continue to rise in many countries. In this case metformin\u2019s usage could be as widely spread across the world as today\u2019s supplements for healthy aging in the US. So 2.5% of the world population would use metformin. I do not expect more because this already means that 15% (0.76 * 0.21 = 0.15) of the population of upper-middle income and high income countries would take metformin. <br/><br/>There could be an even better case, in which almost all the elder population and many young people take metformin, resulting maybe in more than 30% of the population\u00a0of developed countries using metformin.\u00a0But I think this is too improbable and so it\u2019s not included in the calculation.</p><br/><h3>E) By what extent other therapies will reduce metformin\u2019s marginal effect before Longevity Escape Velocity is reached: 50%</h3><p>Metformin seems to have <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(16)30229-7?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1550413116302297%3Fshowall%3Dtrue\">multiple effects on multiple metabolic pathways</a> that are aging related, although it remains unclear if its main effect could be on just one of them, and if the pathway influenced the most is known at all. Metformin\u2019s effect is upstream enough in the metabolism-to-damage chain that the maintenance-type therapies being developed now, which affect the downstream changes produced by aging, could all reduce metformin\u2019s marginal effect.\u00a0And even if metformin somehow reduced only one kind of aging damage (downstream), a more powerful therapy could render metformin less useful. By how much it depends on a variety of factors, among which include: <br/>- How close together in time the first big impact therapies for aging will be available.<br/>- How many big impact therapies are needed in order to reach LEV.<br/>In my intuition, the more abruptly LEV arrives the bigger the marginal effect of metformin could be. If only a single event is sufficient for LEV to arrive, metformin\u2019s effect is full. Otherwise, another therapy could account for a gain of many years of healthy life but not bring LEV, decreasing metformin\u2019s marginal effect by an extent, and more of those kind of therapies could subsequently come. This variable is tough to evaluate and I\u2019m not leaning for any of the two possibilities. My correction is 50%. I understand this estimate really leaves something to be desired,\u00a0and I do not know if\u00a0I could do much better using only current evidence.</p><br/><h3>F) Chance the government will not complete funding the trial: 82%</h3><p>This discount is necessary if we want to calculate only the marginal effect of donations to TAME. In order to estimate this chance I contacted Nir Barzilai, one prominent proposer of the TAME trial and author of <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(16)30229-7?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1550413116302297%3Fshowall%3Dtrue\">Metformin as a Tool to Target Aging</a>. He confirmed they applied for government funding, although it is still unsure if the government will fund the trial. Considering that around <a href=\"https://nexus.od.nih.gov/all/2015/06/29/what-are-the-chances-of-getting-funded/\">18% of the applications to NIH</a> result in an award, the chance the government will <em>not</em> fund the trial is 82%.</p><br/><h3>G) Expected number of years LEV will be advanced by, considering the icebreaking effect of TAME: 3.6</h3><p>The TAME trial was conceived in 2014 and\u00a0till till now AFAR was able to raise half of the $75 millions needed\u00a0(see <a href=\"about:blank#H\">H</a>). I could project that there is a 50% chance that in the next four years the funding will be completed anyway. Splitting chances evenly among the next four years, each year has a 12.5% chance of being the one in which the trial is funded. Extending it four years further, considering that\u00a0eight\u00a0years from now\u00a0something else could cause the icebreaking effect anyway, there\u2019s a 12.5% chance per year for the next eight years that the icebreaking will happen spontaneously. So the expected number of years LEV will be advanced is, let\u2019s say, no more than: \u00a00.125*8 + 0.125*7 + 0.125*6 + 0.125*5 + 0.125*4 + 0.125*3 + 0.125*2 + 0.125*1 = 4.5.</p><p>Will advancing the date of the icebreaking effect by 4.5 years result in an advance of LEV of 4.5 years? Probably not, since the FDA not recognising aging as an indication does not stop aging research, and it\u2018s not clear if the icebreaking effect is a bottleneck for achieving LEV. Such an effect could, though, increase the budget of aging research and make research in this field more focused on translation and on the hallmarks of aging instead of single diseases, their symptoms, or transversal topics (to get a sense of how the budget is allocated right now you can see it\u00a0directly on <a href=\"https://report.nih.gov/categorical_spending_project_listing.aspx?ARRA=N&DCat=Aging&FY=2015\">NIH\u2019s website</a>). If the icebreaking effect enables the funding of one or more projects which are bottlenecks to LEV, then LEV&#x27;s date is advanced. The main probability at play here is if NIH would indeed increase its budget on aging or spend it better. If this does not\u00a0happen I do not anticipate other actors would step in who wouldn\u2019t otherwise. Since the expert opinion on this is that such a thing will happen (it is the objective of TAME stated by AFAR and Barzilai), I will put this probability at 80%. 4.5*0.8 = 3.6.</p><p>Coming up with a good value for this variable is\u00a0difficult, and the figure is not very robust. It should be noted, though, that in the calculation the number of people dying per year will have the most influence and the size of this variable does not\u00a0influence the bottom line much. \u00a0</p><br/><h3>H) Dollars necessary to complete the funding of the TAME trial: $37.5M</h3><p>In order to evaluate this variable I contacted Nir Barzilai and Odette van der Willik, the director of the grant programs at AFAR. They said that till now AFAR was able to raise half of the $75 millions necessary to fund the trial. So the other half remains to be funded. $75M/2 = $37.5M</p><br/><h1>Calculation\u00a0</h1><p><strong>Accounting for everything</strong>: <a href=\"about:blank#H\">H</a>/(<a href=\"about:blank#A\">A</a>*<a href=\"about:blank#B\">B</a>*<a href=\"about:blank#C\">C</a>*<a href=\"about:blank#D\">D</a>*<a href=\"about:blank#E\">E</a>*<a href=\"about:blank#F\">F</a> + <a href=\"about:blank#G\">G</a>*<a href=\"about:blank#C\">C</a>)</p><p><strong>Worst case</strong>: 37500000/(1*0.10*65000000*0.0013*0.5*0.82 + 3.6*65000000) = <strong>0.16$</strong><br/><strong>Average case</strong>: 37500000/(1*0.47*88000000*0.013*0.5*0.82 + 3.6*88000000) = <strong>0.12$</strong><br/><strong>Best case</strong>: 37500000/(1*0.84*98000000*0.025*0.5*0.82 + 3.6*98000000) = <strong>0.11$</strong></p><p><strong>Only accounting for the icebreaking effect</strong>: <a href=\"about:blank#H\">H</a>/(<a href=\"about:blank#G\">G</a>*<a href=\"about:blank#C\">C</a>))</p><p><strong>Worst case</strong>: 37500000/(3.6*65000000) = <strong>0.16$</strong><br/><strong>Average case</strong>: 37500000/(3.6*88000000) = <strong>0.12$</strong><br/><strong>Best case</strong>: 37500000/(3.6*98000000) = <strong>0.11$</strong></p><p><strong>Without accounting for the icebreaking effect</strong>: <strong><a href=\"about:blank#H\">H</a>/(<a href=\"about:blank#A\">A</a>*<a href=\"about:blank#B\">B</a>*<a href=\"about:blank#C\">C</a>*<a href=\"about:blank#D\">D</a>*<a href=\"about:blank#E\">E</a>*<a href=\"about:blank#F\">F</a>)</strong></p><p><strong>Worst case</strong>: 37500000/(1*0.10*65000000*0.0013*0.5*0.82) = <strong>10824$</strong><br/><strong>Average case</strong>: 37500000/(1*0.47*88000000*0.013*0.5*0.82) = <strong>170$</strong><br/><strong>Best case</strong>: 37500000/(1*0.84*98000000*0.025*0.5*0.82) = <strong>44$</strong></p><p><strong>Edit:\u00a0</strong>Upon suggestion (see comments) I set up a Guesstimate model (<a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/10848\">here</a>). You can find wider confidence intervals (and probability distributions) for my final estimates there.\u00a0You may want\u00a0to combine my estimates with your own priors on general intervention&#x27;s effectiveness and thereby potentially correct for the high levels of uncertainty in my model.</p><p>This result shows that most of the cost-effectiveness of TAME comes from its icebreaking effect. The variable <a href=\"about:blank#G\">G</a> is not very robust although it should be noted that the majority of influence on the cost-effectiveness come from the scope of the problem (the variable <a href=\"about:blank#C\">C</a>)\u00a0so with even lower values of <a href=\"about:blank#G\">G</a>, the figure would be small. Overall this funding opportunity is potentially very cost effective, although there could be further corrections I missed. Five cases out of six are\u00a0at least\u00a0one order of magnitude better than GiveWell\u2019s recommendations, although this evaluation is probably less robust than GiveWell\u2019s ones. A counterbalance to its lack of robustness (although probably very small) is that this analysis does not\u00a0account for DALYs averted and the economic gains of a compression of the old age morbidity of a nation (the \u201clongevity dividend\u201d), that could enhance the cost-effectiveness a bit more.</p><p>It should be noted that the worst case that does not account for the icebreaking effect possibly acts like a cap. I do not expect the real cost effectiveness to be worse than that, or, if worse, not much worse.</p><p>Accounting for the icebreaking effect, in the denominator, I multiplied the expected years LEV should be advanced by TAME with the number of people dying of aging per year. The result of the multiplication remains exactly the same even in the face of a slow spreading of rejuvenating therapies (and so LEV) across the world in many years. If\u00a03.6 years seems too much it has to be considered that even approaching 0, it will generate a result always smaller than the ones not accounting for the icebreaking effect.</p><p>The order of magnitude of the results that do not account for the icebreaking effect is highly influenced by the percentage of people who will take metformin consistently (variable <a href=\"about:blank#D\">D</a>), making it probably the most relevant factor in the calculation together with the number of people dying of aging\u00a0in a year near LEV (variable <a href=\"about:blank#B\">B</a>), although this one varies in a smaller interval.\u00a0</p><br/><h1>QALYs saved and the longevity dividend</h1><p>In this post I did not\u00a0account for the QALYs saved by metformin without considering LEV. I expect this figure to be\u00a0probably higher than 1 for an individual taking metformin, since the RRs for many disorders is around 0.80 [<a href=\"about:blank#7\">7</a>], suggesting metformin compresses the period of morbidity at the end of life. According to Barzilai this would save around 4 trillions of dollars. But this would be a completely different calculation and I do not expect the result to be competitive with other interventions in Effective Altruism if not summed with the ones in this analysis.\u00a0</p><br/><h1>Future directions in evaluating the cause area of aging</h1><p>Financing the TAME trial may prove to be an effective intervention, but the\u00a0effect of metformin or other existing simple interventions is negligible if compared to the potential effect of translational basic research being conducted now that directly targets <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3836174/\">the hallmarks of aging</a>. Organisations working in this area are more difficult to evaluate, due to the uncertainty inherent to basic research. Nonetheless I think the work that some of them are doing is being terribly neglected despite their research being a bottleneck to the goal of curing age related diseases. Evaluating those opportunities could have an impact too high to ignore. My approach will probably be to classify the hallmarks of aging by their current neglectedness, tractability and scope, trying to find all the companies or non profit organisations making research in each one of them and classifying the different organisations by how they approach the problem. This will be a much more difficult task than the present evaluation. Other interesting questions I will try to answer relate to the impact of advocacy and\u00a0inducing policy changes in this area, potentially having a multiplicative effect on dollars donated.</p><br/><h1>Endnotes</h1><br/><p>[1]: I\u2019m still in the process of learning how to do good cost-effectiveness analyses.

TAME has been under reviews through several funding mechanisms and has received planning funding from AFAR <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(16)30229-7?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS1550413116302297%3Fshowall%3Dtrue\">(Barzilai et al., 2016, p. 1)</a>. Till now this organisation raised half the funding needed for the trial (source: email exchange with Nir Barzilai and Odette van der Willik, the director of the grant programs at AFAR).</p><br/><p>[3] Longevity Escape Velocity, or LEV, is reached when life expectancy raises at least one year per year. This concept was first introduced by David Gobel, co-founder of the Methuselah Foundation, and spearheaded by Aubrey de Grey in his book Ending Aging. After the first treatments targeting aging will be available to the public, there will be a point in which societies become effectively non-aging through reaching LEV before the complete elimination of aging happens, maybe much before it. This because of two reasons:</p><ul><li> Multiple interventions are needed in order to target all the aspects of aging, and at first they will be imperfect but they will increase life expectancy more and more as they improve.<br/> </li><li> Eliminating the aging damages accumulating in a human lifetime is a different challenge than eliminating the damages accumulating in a longer than human lifespan. Therefore being able to eliminate damages responsible for current human death by aging does not\u00a0guarantee achieving negligible senescence, but additional therapies may be needed. Given the fast rate at which technology improves after the first proof of concepts work, it&#x27;s very probable that subsequent advances will go faster than the rates of death by aging. Especially because at the point when a second wave of therapies will be needed, much more funding will be available (the idea of eliminating aging will be something really mainstream) and\u00a0researchers\u00a0will have much better tools than today&#x27;s, while the challenge will be probably similar in difficulty and general approach (removing damaging molecules, repairing structures inside the cell, replacing or repairing tissue etc.).<br/> </li></ul><br/><p>[4]: As Richard Feynman puts it in his 1964 lecture at the Galileo Symposium in Italy titled \u201cWhat Is and What Should Be the Role of Scientific Culture in Modern Society\u201d:</p><blockquote> It is one of the most remarkable things that in all of the biological sciences there is no clue as to the necessity of death. If you say we want to make perpetual motion, we have discovered enough laws as we studied physics to see that it is either absolutely impossible or else the laws are wrong. But there is nothing in biology yet found that indicates the inevitability of death. This suggests to me that it is not at all inevitable, and that it is only a matter of time before the biologists discover what it is that is causing us the trouble and that that terrible universal disease or temporariness of the human\u2019s body will be cured.<br/> </blockquote><br/><p>[5]: Serious efforts about a comprehensive strategy to bring aging under medical control started in the early 2000s, thanks to Aubrey de Grey\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11976218\">early proposals</a> (2002) to the biogerontology community and his landmark book Ending Aging (2007), providing a definition of the problem that renders it attackable. At first it encountered <a href=\"https://www2.technologyreview.com/sens/docs/estepetal.pdf\">some resistance</a>, that, though, was <a href=\"https://www2.technologyreview.com/sens/\">not adopted as the main position</a>:</p><blockquote> We need to remember that all hypotheses go through a stage where one or a small number of investigators believe something and others raise doubts. The conventional wisdom is usually correct. But while most radical ideas are in fact wrong, it is a hallmark of the scientific process that it is fair about considering new propositions; every now and then, radical ideas turn out to be true. Indeed, these exceptions are often the most momentous discoveries in science. (MIT Technology Review, 2006).\u00a0<br/> </blockquote><p>With the hindsight of today it is safe to say that de Grey\u2019s ideas proved to be the kind that causes a paradigm shift. <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3836174/\">\u201cThe Hallmarks of Aging\u201d</a> (2013) is a cornerstone in the field that guides today\u2019s research and it contains the same ideas first spearheaded by de Grey, with aging defined as a similar categorisation of damages, with a comprehensive, divide et impera, view of the problem.</p><p>Some particularly developed or interesting branches today are stem cell research, <a href=\"https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(16)31664-6\">in vivo reprogramming using Yamanaka Factors</a>, senescent cells removal, preventing epigenetic errors.

If we&#x2019;re not failing, then we&#x2019;re not trying enough new stuff. One thing that&#x2019;s been mentioned quite a few times, although less so recently, is <a href=\"/ea/1hn/towards_effective_entrepreneurship_good/\">altruistic entrepreneurship</a>: starting companies as a high-risk, high-reward strategy: you might build something that solves an important problem and acquire oodles of cash you can give away afterwards. I tried this and it didn&#x2019;t really work out for me, so I thought I&#x2019;d share the story. I&#x2019;ve been meaning to write this up for a while &#x2013; I called time on Hippo back in October 2017 &#x2013; and seeing Joey Savoie&#x2019;s rather optimistic post on the <a href=\"/ea/1og/why_founding_charities_is_one_of_the_highest/\">value of starting charities</a>&#xA0;has prompted me to finally add my own less optimistic data point about starting companies.</span></p>\n<h1><span>What was <a href=\"http://www.hippo.rocks/\">Hippo</a>?</span></h1>\n<p><span><a href=\"http://www.hippo.rocks/\">Hippo</a>&#xA0;is/was a happiness tracker-training app, which I used to try and describe as a &#x2018;FitBit for the mind&#x2019;. The idea was you could track what you were doing, thinking and feeling, get a better understanding of how your life was going and use that to change how you live. The way it worked &#x2013; or rather, was supposed to work &#x2013; was that it would randomly ping you in the day, you&#x2019;d enter your data, the app would display your data and you could learn what was driving your emotions. We never got as far as selling it, but we were considering our potential markets as (1) consumers, particularly the sort of people into mindfulness and the quantified-self (2) an emotional support/employee satisfaction tool for companies (3) a mental health monitoring/self-care app paid for by health providers.</span></p>\n<p><span>If you have an android phone, you can still&#xA0;<a href=\"https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.hippo\">download it</a>.</span></p>\n<h1><span>What was Hippo supposed to be?</span></h1>\n<p><span>I had grander plans than tracking happiness. The goal was to build an app that&#xA0;would &#x2018;solve&#x2019; happiness. The idea was to create something that would monitor how you were feeling over time, let you understand that better, then analyse your data to give you the support, guidance and tools you needed when you needed them. In practice, this would mean combining subjective data (i.e. self reports) with objective data (location, movement, etc.) to learn what was associated with your mood scores, and then give you flexible, tailored guidance.</span></p>\n<p><span>As an example of how the guidance might work, suppose you reported an unusually low happiness score. Hippo might then suggest you go for a walk, watch a TED talk, practise mindfulness, write down your greatest achievement and how you achieved it, phone a friend, etc and would try to intelligently offer the best option. I&#x2019;d compiled a list of 40-odd evidence-based activities and re-thinking exercises, i.e. behavioural and cognitive interventions, that I&#x2019;d come across during my research, and hoped we could use machine learning to give people ever more useful recommendations over time. From speaking to hundreds of people, I&#x2019;d found there was a huge gap between the things that were shown to increase mood/support mental health and what people either knew about or did.</span></p>\n<p><span>As I saw it, there was a neat and obvious way technology could help people live happier lives that no one else was trying. It was perhaps</span><span>, in tech jargon, a &apos;</span><a href=\"https://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/moonshot\">moonshot</a><span>&apos;: an ambitious, unlikely-to-succeed attempt to use new technology to solve a huge problem.</span></p>\n<h1><span>How did we get started? How did things fall apart? </span></h1>\n<p><span>TL;DR version:</span></p>\n<p><span>I became sad. This gave me the idea for the app. I found someone to help me build it. We worked on it part-time for 2 years. We never quite built anything that worked. Eventually everyone left.</span></p>\n<p><span>Longer version:</span></p>\n<p><span>I got the idea for Hippo back in Spring 2015. I was working on another business idea, which also never got off the ground (a happiness-behavioural science consultancy). I felt I was generally failing at life when I suddenly, unexpectedly discovered I was very depressed. At the time I looked round for an app to help me - this was back in 2015, when apps were new and the sexy solution to everything - and couldn&#x2019;t find anything. I threw a bunch of things at my depression - antidepressants, CBT, mindfulness, gratitude journaling, etc. - which were, in my case, really successful. After I recovered I was left with the abiding frustrating that the technology that would have saved me could exist, it just didn&#x2019;t exist yet. Armed with my own experiences and my utilitarian hat firmly on my head, I started thinking seriously about how to create a happiness app which could, in theory, end up spreading around the world and changing lives. It seemed like the most good I could be trying to do.</span></p>\n<p><span>The early days (March to September 2015) are now a bit too long ago to remember. I started talking to lots of people about it to gather feedback, Lean Start-Up style. Through a friend&#x2019;s introduction, I spoke to a major high street bank. They said they were interested in running a trial; the idea was we&#x2019;d using anonymised mood tracking on employees then (1) provide a &#x2018;temperature check&#x2019; of employee satisfaction and (2) analyse the data to tell them what they should do to have happier staff (and less absenteeism, churn, etc.). We were in! </span></p>\n<p><span>Problem: I didn&#x2019;t have a product; it was just an idea. I told them I&#x2019;d get back to them in a few months. I couldn&#x2019;t code - I still can&#x2019;t - so I considered paying someone to have an early version created. Fortunately, I didn&#x2019;t. That would have been a huge waste of money given I had no idea what I was doing. I stumbled across an android developer, David, who was introduced to me through a friend. David agreed to start working for free in exchange for notional equity (&#x2018;sweat equity&#x2019;), which was a huge coup. We started to try and design the app over summer 2015, which I found horrendously frustrating because I have no eye for design. But we were under way. Stardom and riches beckoned! I could practically see my face on Wired magazine.</span></p>\n<p><span>In September 2015 I moved to Oxford to start a moral philosophy PhD. I was, and still am, researching ways to increase happiness, so there was some synergy. I&#x2019;d been given a place in March 2015, just as I had about pulled myself out of depression. I didn&#x2019;t find it a problem to work on a start up and do PhD research simultaneously. The work I was doing for Hippo &#x2013; designing the product and talking to users &#x2013; I was able to do much quicker than David was able to build the product (he had a normal developer job). I&#x2019;d work out where I think we needed to go next, pass that on, and then get back to reading philosophy, psychology and economics papers. Switching between the two types of activity was hard because the skill sets were so radically different. The empirical work I did into happiness as part of the PhD did feed into the app, but nothing about start ups helped me write better philosophy. At the time I thought I could easily do both, but now I&#x2019;m spending all my time doing philosophy I can really see how much more effective I am compared to when I was splitting my concentration between two things.</span></p>\n<p><span>At the turn of 2016 we launched the first, extremely alpha version of the product to a few people. It wasn&#x2019;t an instant success, but some people did use it and find it useful, which astonished me. I did a whole new set of user interviews and my co-founder and I slowly worked on improving the product. We iterated through this several times. I found the uncertainty of trying to work out what was the best thing to do next terrifying. By the time we launched the alpha it was 9 months since we&#x2019;d had the expression of interest from the bank. We went back to them apologetically telling them &#x201C;hey, we&#x2019;ve built something&#x201D; but they never replied. Too slow, clearly. </span></p>\n<p><span>Around March that year started talked to a computer scientist from my college, who I&#x2019;ll call &#x2018;A&#x2019;, about building a machine learning algorithm. Basic premise: you tell us how you&#x2019;re feeling, we give you an evidence-based suggestions. You tell if it was good and it learns over time. Over the next couple of months, I designed a spreadsheet with all the inputs and outputs and an initial algorithm, which I handed it over to A who&#x2019;d agreed to implement it. He was pretty enthusiastic but basically nothing happened for months and months. I&#x2019;d get distracted with my work, then sometimes chase him and he&#x2019;d always promise it would be just around the corner. I didn&#x2019;t really have any bargaining power or other options, and I believed he would eventually produce something, so I chose to wait it out. In retrospect, there was no need to even try to use maching learning: we could have just randomly given people suggestions if they pressed a button; the suggestions were only text anyway. Ah, Captain Hindsight, the smartest man I know!</span></p>\n<p><span>Throughout 2016, and doubtless to the frustration of my then-supervisor, I&#x2019;d go through bursts of working on Hippo, then switching back to philosophy. The main problem with Hippo as a happiness tracker was that, fundamentally, it wasn&#x2019;t that useful to people. Sounds obvious now, but took us ages to work out that was the problem. People seemed to like the idea, but didn&#x2019;t find it useful and, where they said they found it useful, still didn&#x2019;t stick with it. We ran into some key technical issues &#x2013; it wouldn&#x2019;t randomly send the notifications asking you for your data - &#xA0;and never solved them, which meant Hippo never actually did what we wanted it to.</span></p>\n<p><span>Despite all this, and clearly in grip of self-delusion, I pitched Hippo to Y-combinator in Autumn 2016. It seemed like a big, crazy enough idea they might go for it. At the time, I thought Hippo had a higher expected value than my academic research (which wasn&#x2019;t going terribly well, in part because I was neglecting it to work on the app) and was contemplating the process of dropping out of university if we found funding to allow David to work full-time. I thought the gap in the market(s) and the solution was so obvious I was convinced that, if I didn&#x2019;t get there first, someone else would.</span></p>\n<p><span>A consistent problem, with a single developer working in his spare time, was that we constantly struggled with the amount of development we could do. Late 2016 onwards I increasingly focused on trying find additional developers who would come and work for Hippo. This was a really hard sell: we weren&#x2019;t growing, we didn&#x2019;t have any money. Probably the most psychologically painful part for me was having to try and convince other people of my idea, an idea I was still struggling to articulate, to get them to join the project I was constantly frustrated with myself. Around the same point I started entering a few pitch competitions and going to entrepreneurship courses. I thought it would be useful to get feedback on the product and maybe find some guidance on what I should be doing. As far as I could tell this was almost entirely a waste of time. I did meet a lot of people who were slightly enthusiastic about helping, but almost no one who was genuinely useful, i.e. shared my dream and could tell me something I didn&apos;t already know. I was approached by an angel investor in early 2017; he&#x2019;d heard about the project through someone I vaguely knew. This&#xA0;made the whole enterprise suddenly potentially serious: he was looking for a sort of HR-happiness-engagement product already but hadn&#x2019;t developed anything yet himself. In the end, we couldn&#x2019;t reach a deal. I wanted some investment so that David could work full time, whereas what the investor wanted was equity in Hippo in exchange for (what seemed to me) an extremely vague partnership arrangement and, possibly, some investment afterwards. To quote a current line from British politics, it seemed that &#x2018;no deal is better than a bad deal&#x2019; and I turned it down. </span></p>\n<p><span>We&#x2019;re now in Spring-Summer 2017 and the final few months of Hippo&#x2019;s life. A, the computer scientist, got conscripted into the Egyptian army, never ending up building the AI algorithm we&#x2019;d been discussing, and disappeared. This turned out to be good thing in one sense. With him gone, I decided I should manually test the smart-suggestion system: I got people to send me messages on facebook, I asked them some standard questions and then sent them a suggestion for what they should do now. It actually worked pretty well and caused a brief burst of enthusiasm. After a philosophy talk I&#x2019;d given, another developer, call him &#x2018;V&#x2019;, offered to work on the app and our fortunes suddenly looked up. But only briefly. We went our separate ways for summer, and when we came back V had found a job in San Francisco and was no longer interested. Around the same period, I saw CEA advertising a part-time role as Peter Singer&#x2019;s research assistant. He was planning to write a book on overpopulation, a topic I&#x2019;d accidentally ended up working on in my thesis. I applied, was offered and gleefully accepted the role (I know, odd twist for a start-up story...). I&#x2019;d also done about 2 years of my PhD and it looked like finishing was both in sight and worthwhile. This series of events were significant because, for the first time (in my eyes) it seemed I would have a higher expected value by sticking in philosophy than continuing with Hippo. V&#x2019;s departure or, rather, non-arrival, killed my enthusiasm for Hippo because I knew I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to summon the energy to try and convince someone else to join David and myself. By contrast, having had a pretty shaky first two years of the PhD, getting the RA job made me much more confident I might find a position in academic philosophy afterwards.</span></p>\n<p><span>I would, actually, have kept working on Hippo, even despite this. We were reasonably close to implementing the happiness-suggestions feature (&#x2018;instacheer&#x2019;), at which point the app might have started being useful. David, my co-founder, ending up getting a different job and losing interest for his own reasons. Disappointingly, I never got to test my underlying hypothesis, namely: if we create a moodtracking app and use that info to give people people nudges on what to do, it will be useful enough that people and companies will pay for it. </span></p>\n<p><span>And there I was, October 2017, two and half years later, the last one standing, and decided it was time to give up. So it ended. Not with a bang, but with a whimper.</span></p>\n<h1><span>What would I do differently?</span></h1>\n<p><span>As I see it, our failure was that we never built the thing we were trying to build. It&#x2019;s not that we built a rocketship, launched the rocketship and saw the rocketship accidentally explode into a million pieces. Rather, we had a blueprint for a rocketship and there are still a million pieces for it sitting on the launchpad awaiting assembly when we walked away.</span></p>\n<p><span> Why did we never get there? I think my particular mistake was probably being too optimistic about how much development work David and A would and could do. I should have been more critical of our development productivity and not given them so much of the benefit of the doubt. That might sound indulgent (&#x201C;my main flaw is that I believe in people&#x201D;), but I&apos;ve come to realise this is a genuine flaw of mine: you can be too distrustful and you can be too trusting. I am the latter. I don&apos;t think I was a very good manager.</span></p>\n<p><span>To explain, if I&#x2019;d realised H, the guy who agreed to build the machine learning algorithm behind the smart-suggestions feature, wasn&#x2019;t really doing anything, I would have tried much harder to find someone to replace him. Or, I would have done what I eventually did, which was test the prototype feature manually. Really, I should have run that test&#xA0;months earlier than I did. Equally, if I&#x2019;d realised how slowly David would be able to make progress - one guy working part-time sometimes - I&#x2019;d have done one or more of the following: (a) tried harder find an additional coder; (b) learnt to code myself - which I might have done if I&#x2019;d not found David; (c) looked harder for investment; (d) given up earlier. As it was, we sort of plodded along, making enough progress that it seemed better to continue the current course. If we&#x2019;d gone much slower we/I would have changed course. If&#xA0;we&apos;d had the development resources to produce our product, we&apos;d at least have tested the product we had in mind. We probably have failed later too, but that would be for a different reason requiring different explanation. A major problem was that, as a non-technical founder, I couldn&apos;t evaluate how much was happening. Of course, if we&apos;d been building a building, it would have been obvious...</span></p>\n<p><span>Saying the problem was misunderstanding how slowly development was occuring might also sound indolent (&quot;why didn&apos;t you just build it yourself?&quot;). Hardcore techies will probably be thinking I should have just dropped the PhD. I thought about that a lot, but as no point did that seem like the right choice. My objective was and is to increase worlwide happiness. Start a start up seemed like a means to achieving that end. But so did my PhD research, which is on the topic &apos;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/qeUOHOCFteM\">how do we maximise world happiness</a>?&apos;&#xA0;Given I had a technical co-founder but&#xA0;no programming skill myself, it never seemed like my comparative advantage would be to drop philosophy research in order to become an novice coder.</span></p>\n<h1><span>Potential lessons for aspirant altruistic entrepreneurs</span></h1>\n<p><span>This is a bit tricky, because I don&#x2019;t know how much I learnt that is also useful. My main reflection on Hippo was that I felt that I spent a huge amount of time to achieve not very much. I would consider that the cautionary tale. Here&#x2019;s my list:</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Startups do not necessarily teach you useful skills, particularly if your alternative option is to work in a different field</strong>. My expectation was that, whatever happened, I would learn loads to take to what I did next. As an aspirant philosopher, almost nothing I learnt from about entrepreneurship is directly applicable. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Failing unremarkably can happen and is something you should consider as a possibility</strong>. If I were to claim I had built career capital as a result of my 2.5 (mis)adventure, I would be deceiving myself. As it is I walk away with no cool story, no CV points. At least if I&#x2019;d blown some money (mine or someone else&apos;s) and failed spectacularly, then I would have a story and I&#x2019;d have felt that I&#x2019;d really tried and failed. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>You will likely learn things about yourself you didn&#x2019;t expect to learn</strong>. In my case, I think this was (a) I put too much trust that people will do the work they say they will(/I have no idea how to manage people); (b) I don&#x2019;t like working under great uncertainty; (c) I cannot stand trying to sell or &#x2018;pitch&#x2019; commercial ideas (pitching philosophical ideas are fine); (d) I&#x2019;m not very good at practical details (conceptual details are fine); (e) probably, most usefully of all, I improved my ability to be self-critical. Start up methodology (e.g. Lean Start-up, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_xjb7LB7VY\">the Mom test</a>) teaches you how to discover what people really think when they&#x2019;re being too nice to tell you your product sucks. (e) does have psychological downsides (see below).</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>It&#x2019;s not enough to try to build something you think the world needs.</strong> I started Hippo because I thought it might do an enormous amount of good. Yet, to make a successful product, you need to build something which is useful to people, not just something you think would to be useful to them. I potential danger with an EA start-up is that you might, as I did, find a hypothetical solution and try to retro-fit a business case.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>If you try to start something, loads of people try to help you; unfortunately, many of them will be useless</strong>. I was honestly impressed at the fact people (well, mostly 1 other person) were willing to spend their time working on my crazy project and do so for free. Loads of people offered to help out: they gave advice, were willing to let me interview them to talk about the app, etc. Admittedly, lots of the help isn&#x2019;t very useful, and a relevant challenge is to sift through all the different perspectives people give you and make your own decision. </span></p>\n<p><span><strong>The uncertainty can be terrifying.</strong> The constant experience of not knowing what to do in start-up life was, for me, anxiety-inducing and something that didn&#x2019;t seem to get much better over time (if only there was an app to help people with their moods, oh wait&#x2026;).&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>While failing is very common, it can still be psychologically very hard</strong>. In theory, I should feel glad that I dedicated a considerable amount of time to something I thought would have the highest expected value. As it happens, my abiding psychological response, when I think about Hippo, and which is probably irrational, is one of frustration and shame with only a glimmer of pride. Frustration that we never built what I wanted to test. Shame that I feel, in some sense, I wasted my time and should have known better. A glimmer of pride that I, at least, stuck with it for so long. The tragedy, as I feel it, is that I never found out if my hypothesis about an ideal piece of happiness-inducing tech was correct. I haven&#x2019;t seen anyone else build it (yet) and I feel sufficiently burnt out by my experience I lack the motivation to try again. </span></p>\n<h1><span>Conclusion</span></h1>\n<p><span>Although I billed this a something of cautionary tale of failure, to be clear, I&#x2019;m not suggesting EAs shouldn&#x2019;t try to start start-ups.

I will call these versions <strong>moral realism worthy of the name</strong>. Thus, I don\u2019t claim that all versions of moral realism discussed in the academic literature are mistaken.</p><p>The goal of this introductory post is threefold:</p><ol><li>to give a quick overview of metaethics<a href=\"#fn-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-1\"><sup>[1]</sup></a> and different versions of moral realism</li><li>to explain why I find many of these versions of moral realism only modestly relevant to ethical practice</li><li>to outline what I take to be <i>moral realism worthy of the name</i></li></ol><h1>Overview and summary</h1><p>Two definitions of moral realism</p><ul><li>Moral realism has two common definitions: the semantic definition and the ontological one. I contrast these to illustrate how moral claims can be discussed at a <i>linguistic</i> level (\u201cWhat do people mean when they make moral claims?\u201d and a <i>substantive</i> level (\u201cGiven the objectivist assumption that moral claims refer to a speaker-independent moral reality, are they sometimes true?\u201d).

I illustrate these positions with a few examples. I argue that naturalism is at risk of being too trivial (e.g., Peter Railton\u2019s moral realism does not seem to have action-guiding implications for people already interested in effective altruism), while non-naturalism is at risk of being too radically strange.</li></ul><p>Moral realism worthy of the name: Two proposals</p><ul><li>Inspired by the naturalism vs. non-naturalism distinction, I outline two versions of moral realism that <i>would have</i> important implications for effective altruism if they were true. One of them is moral non-naturalism in its essence of <i>irreducible normativity</i>, the other is a naturalism-inspired position I will call <i>One Compelling Axiology</i>. In upcoming articles, I will argue why I disagree with both those moral realism proposals.</li></ul><h1>Two definitions of moral realism</h1><p>Moral realism has been defined in different ways by different authors. I will start by discussing two different definitions, both of which are broad in that they allow for many different positions to count as \u2018moral realism.\u2019</p><h2>1. The semantic definition</h2><p>The first definition is from Geoffrey Sayre-McCord\u2019s <i>Essays on Moral Realism</i> (1988, p. 5). It is meant to serve as a definition for realism, not just about morality, but about any domain of claims under scrutiny.</p><blockquote><p>Wherever it is found, [...] realism involves embracing just two theses: (i) the claims in question, when literally construed, are literally true or false (cognitivism), and (ii) some are literally true. Nothing more.</p></blockquote><p>Sayre-McCord\u2019s definition illustrates a confusing feature of the debate between moral realists and moral anti-realists: the discussion can happen simultaneously on two levels. At the first level (I will call it the linguistic level), people disagree about the <i>nature</i> of first-order moral claims \u2013 about what competent speakers mean when they say things such as \u201cMurder is wrong.\u201d On the second, substantive level, people disagree about whether some moral claims (properly interpreted) are true, or whether all first-order moral claims are false. (Second-order moral claims, such as \u201call first-order moral claims are false,\u201d can still be true even if all first-order moral claims are false.)</p><p>We can now see that different positions on the linguistic level lead to different types of moral realism. Consider two moral realists. One thinks that moral claims such as \u201cX is wrong\u201d just mean the same thing as, e.g., \u201cX reduces net happiness,\u201d and she thinks that some of these claims are true. Another thinks that moral claims such as \u201cX is wrong\u201d refer to an irreducible property of <i>wrongness</i>, and he thinks that some of <i>these</i> claims are true. While these are both forms of moral realism, they are quite different.</p><p><strong>Merely semantic versions of moral realism</strong></p><p>The semantic definition allows for the situation that whether one endorses realismcan depend solely on one\u2019s views about language rather than one\u2019s views about morality. Specifically, some versions of moral realism are grounded in idiosyncratic or minimalist accounts of what it means for a claim to be true (see <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatism/\">pragmatism</a><a href=\"#fn-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a> or minimalism about talk of truth<a href=\"#fn-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a>). I won\u2019t address these views further both because they are rarely explicitly defended and because any moral realism endorsed on merely semantic grounds is going to be inconsequential: whether we consider it true or not only has consequences for how we would <i>speak</i> (i.e., whether to call something moral realism or not), not for how we would <i>act</i>.</p><p><strong>Non-cognitivism</strong></p><p>Some moral anti-realists hold that moral claims are <i>not</i> best interpreted as claims that can conceivably be true or false (that is, are not truth-apt). This position is called non-cognitivism (<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-cognitivism/\">as opposed to cognitivism</a>); it is the most radical form of anti-realism.</p><p>One non-cognitivist view is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressivism#Historical_development:_from_noncognitivism/emotivism_to_cognitivist_expressivism\"><i>expressivism</i></a>, which holds that moral claims are best interpreted as expressions of an evaluative attitude (veiled expressions of, e.g., the speaker\u2019s approval or disapproval). According to the expressivist view, when someone says \u201cMurder is wrong,\u201d the best interpretation of that statement is not something that can literally be true or false. Rather, the statement employs similar language to that used in truth-apt statements to express disapproval. \u201cMurder is wrong,\u201d that is to say, is just a non-cognitive expression of disapproval of murder; it can\u2019t be true or false any more than it can be true or false to say \u201cOuch!\u201d when you hit yourself with a hammer. \u201cMurder is wrong\u201d <i>looks</i> like a claim, but the appearance is deceptive.</p><p>Non-cognitivists have a great deal of explaining to do. They need to account for why moral discourse has the appearance of asserting truths, not just when we make emotionally loaded statements like \u201cWhat you\u2019re doing is just wrong!\u201d, but also in the context of carefully reasoned philosophical discussions. We readily <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expressivism#The_Frege%E2%80%93Geach_problem\">use logic</a> to analyze moral claims, or we talk about moral \u2018beliefs\u2019 and moral \u2018knowledge\u2019, and we have devoted an entire branch of philosophy (normative and applied ethics) to figuring out <i>which</i> moral claims are true.</p><p><strong>Linguistic-level disagreements are inconsequential</strong></p><p>Furthermore, it seems strange to deny that at least some people\u2019s moral statements are truth-apt. After all, some people are ardent moral realists who make moral claims themselves, and at least some of them will tell us explicitly that they give zero credence to the non-cognitivist interpretation of <i>their</i> moral claims. Whether their intended usage of moral claims is the same as typical usage feels like a secondary question to me. Indeed, I find it surprising that such a substantial portion of metaethics is centered around conceptual analysis on the linguistic level,<a href=\"#fn-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> debating what people might mean when they say things like \u201cX is wrong.\u201d Given that moral realists exist and given that they believe that their interpretations of moral discourse are intelligible and important, it seems like we should be able to address their claims on their merits (or lack thereof), regardless of what else moral discourse may sometimes be about.<a href=\"#fn-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-5\"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p><p>This makes debates about what moral claims mean in everyday language less relevant to my current project. An analogy: Suppose that I\u2019m discussing theology with some philosophers. The philosophers are trying to interpret the Bible, making claims like, \u201cIt's not true <i>within the Biblical storyline</i> that Noah was a woman but true that he was a man,\u201d or, \u201cReligious claims aren\u2019t truth-apt because the authors of those texts were telling parables to express thoughts on the human condition; they didn\u2019t intend to say things that can be true or false in a literal sense.\u201d And all I'm thinking is, \u201cWhy are we so focused on&nbsp;<i>interpreting</i> religious claims? Isn\u2019t the major question here whether there are things such as God, or life after death!?\u201d The question that is of utmost relevance to our lives is whether religion\u2019s <i>metaphysical claims</i>, interpreted in a straightforward and realist fashion, are true or not. An analysis of other claims can come later.</p><p>This is also how I look at the literature on moral realism: Some versions of moral realism would be rather inconsequential if true, while others would be vastly relevant to our lives. Whether the latter stem from a typical interpretation of moral discourse or not is not that important (although if no one took strong realism about morality seriously, that may indicate obvious flaws in the moral realism hypothesis). So given that some versions of moral realism would be vastly more relevant to people\u2019s lives than others, I want to primarily focus on assessing whether strong forms of moral realism are true. Correspondingly, this means I won\u2019t be satisfied with non-cognitivist accounts that brush aside the possibility that strong moral realism is intelligible and evaluable on its own merits, the meaning of ordinary moral discourse aside. (See Kahane, 2013, who argues that moral realism can be intelligible and defensible even if it doesn\u2019t reflect ordinary moral discourse).</p><h2>2. The ontological definition</h2><p>For the purposes of the present essay, I\u2019ll provide a definition of moral realism that works independently of the debate about the proper linguistic interpretation of moral claims. Stephen Finlay\u2019s (2007) definition of what he calls \u2018ontological moral realism\u2019 is just such a definition.</p><blockquote><p>[Ontological moral realism is the claim that] moral claims describe and are made true by some moral <i>facts</i> involving moral <i>entities</i> (e.g., reasons, obligations), <i>relations</i> (e.g., justification), or <i>properties</i> (e.g., goodness, rightness, virtue). [...] This form of realism takes as its objects the truth-makers of moral claims, holding that they include moral properties such as value (e.g., the <i>goodness</i> of charity) and moral entities such as practical reasons and obligations (e.g., <i>reasons</i> not to tell lies, <i>obligations</i> to keep promises).</p></blockquote><p>Ontological moral realism is correct if moral claims are sometimes true in virtue of correctly referring to a moral reality consisting of the \u201ctruth-makers\u201d for moral claims, the entities that make those claims true: moral entities, relations, properties, etc. These entities, further, must exist independently of anyone\u2019s beliefs. What this moral reality would consist of is explicitly left open. Ontological realism is therefore compatible with views according to which moral facts, such as facts about value or disvalue, can be identified with natural facts (e.g. facts about pleasure or suffering), and with non-naturalist views where the moral \u2018reality\u2019 consists of something more abstract (e.g. facts about reasons for action postulated by <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasons-internal-external/\">reasons externalism</a>).<a href=\"#fn-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-6\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> (If the difference between naturalism and non-naturalism seems too abstract now, I\u2019ll address it further later.)</p><p><strong>Different degrees of \u2018objective\u2019</strong></p><p>We can further distinguish three, increasingly \u2018objective\u2019, conceptions of moral reality. All versions of ontological moral realism have in common that they are objective in the sense of being about the existence of <i>moral facts</i>: Facts do not change depending on who we ask or how we look at something. Then there is a second sense of \u2018objective\u2019 that refers to whether those facts are about something that (in part) depends on one\u2019s personal desires/goals/preferences, or whether the facts remain the same even if one\u2019s own desires/goals/preferences are changed.</p><p><i>Subjectivism</i> is the view that moral claims are made true or false with respect to facts about one\u2019s own (i.e., subjective) desires/preferences/goals about the world.</p><p><i>Intersubjectivism</i> is the view that moral claims are made true or false with respect to facts about both one\u2019s own desires/goals/preferences and those of other people. For instance, according to some intersubjectivist views, morality is about rational actors pursuing their own ends while respecting an envisioned social contract.</p><p><i>Objectivism</i> (not to be confused with Ayn Rand\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objectivism_(Ayn_Rand)\">Objectivism</a>, which describes a subjectivist morality based on self-interest) is the view that morality is the same for everyone and independent from one\u2019s personal desires/preferences/goals. (Or that one\u2019s own desires at most count as \u201cone out of thousands\u201d e.g. in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preference_utilitarianism\">preference utilitarianism</a>.)</p><p>Arguably, it is only objectivism that captures the ways in which (at least some people\u2019s) moral intuitions make morality out to be something all-encompassing that every person is bound to.</p><h1>Sidenote: Subjectivism and intersubjectivism</h1><p>Nevertheless, there are subjectivist and intersubjectivist views that would be relevant to our lives if they were true. In this section, I will give two examples of views, one subjectivist and one intersubjectivist, that seem to me like correct and practically relevant ways of thinking about issues in moral philosophy, even though they would plausibly count as \u201cnot realist\u201d according to at least the semantic definition of moral realism.</p><h2>Subjectivism</h2><p><i>Subjectivism</i> holds that moral value is determined by an agent\u2019s personal desires. According to the subjectivist Michael Smith, for instance, what is good for an agent is what the agent would desire if they had perfect information and were perfectly rational. I\u2019m including the following quote from Finlay (2007) because the position sounds like some of the views that have been <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Metaethics_sequence\">discussed</a> prominently on LessWrong:</p><blockquote><p>[...] Smith bases each person\u2019s normative requirements on his or her own desires, subject only to rational enhancement (full information and coherence). Moral claims can be true, he maintains, provided that all rational persons would converge on a common set of desires with a distinctly moral content (Moral Problem 173, 187\u20139). Richard Joyce, who largely accepts Smith\u2019s subjectivist approach as an account of normativity, reasonably objects that this claim on behalf of morality is implausible. Rational selves\u2019 desires are reached by correction from actual selves\u2019 desires, and these starting points are too diverse to support the required kind of convergence (89\u201394).</p></blockquote><p>As a claim about about how moral discourse is to be interpreted, subjectivism holds that \u201cX is good\u201d should be treated as shorthand for \u201cX is good according to my desires\u201d (Sayre-McCord, 1988, p. 18). This seems like a somewhat implausible interpretation of moral discourse to me \u2013 but people\u2019s intuitions about what morality is about may differ. Under the assumption that moral discourse is usually objectivist, while objectivist moral realism is false, perhaps one could resort to subjectivist moral discourse as a way to salvage something useful from the debris. In that case, subjectivism would rather count as (a constructive proposal within) anti-realism rather than a version of realism.</p><p>In any case, I have a lot of thoughts on the merits of subjectivist accounts that specifically refer to what we would come to value after moral reflection under ideal conditions, but will reserve them for later parts of this sequence where I explore options within what I think of as moral <i>anti-realism</i>. So for our purposes here with respect to my upcoming posts on why I\u2019m not a moral realist, I\u2019ll treat subjectivism as one version of anti-realism. Not because this is the obvious way of categorizing it, but because I want to reserve the moral realism label for only the most consequential versions of moral realism.</p><h2>Intersubjectivism</h2><p>Another position located somewhere near the boundary between realist and anti-realist views is constructivism as a metaethical view,<a href=\"#fn-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-7\"><sup>[7]</sup></a> which holds that morality is about what rational actors would hypothetically agree to (under certain idealized conditions) with respect to how everyone, themselves included, should act. Different versions of constructivism give different accounts of how to think about this hypothetical agreement: Some are based on considerations about <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_contract\">social contracts</a>, others on Kantian universalization of one\u2019s decision maxims (\u201cacting as though one expects all other rational people to choose the same decision procedure\u201d). A specification of the conditions under which hypothetical agreement is to be derived is called a <i>constructive function</i> (as explained by Shafer-Landau, 2003, pos. 201).</p><p>Metaethical constructivism is an <i>intersubjectivist</i> position. It is not objectivist because constructive functions merely constrain what follows from people\u2019s desires, preferences, or goals \u2013&nbsp;they do not introduce anything that we ought to do (or is morally good or bad) that goes beyond those desires.</p><p>While I am unconvinced by constructivism as a <i>metaethical</i> position (because that would commit us to the claim that moral discourse is necessarily all about hypothetical contracts rather than also e.g. unconditional altruism or care), I am sympathetic to constructivism being important on pragmatic or prudential grounds. Is there a single, uniquely compelling way to choose a constructive function? I think that the answer is not obviously no. I find it noteworthy that central aspects of (mostly Kantian)<a href=\"#fn-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-8\"><sup>[8]</sup></a> constructivism are mirrored in <a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Decision_theory\">LessWrong-inspired</a> discussions about the <a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/reasons-to-be-nice-to-other-value-systems/#Superrationality\">implications of non-causal decision theories</a>. Perhaps these considerations could be thought of as plausible extensions of the concept \u201crationality as systematized winning,\u201d such that, by getting their implications right, one could increase one\u2019s all-things-considered degree of goal achievement. In any case, whether we want to <i>call</i> this moral realism or not, it is worth flagging constructivism as a moral view according to which morality is potentially action-relevant in a surprisingly non-trivial and yet rationally binding way.</p><p>One reason to perhaps not think of constructivism as moral realism is precisely because it seems to be more of an extension of what it means to be rational rather than what it means to be moral. At least according to some connotations of the word \u2018moral,\u2019 it is tied not only to notions of fairness or rational cooperation, but also to considerations of care or altruism. And while Kantianism or non-causal decision theories may imply that one should care substantially about the desires of other rational agents (in a perhaps power-weighted fashion), they do not imply anything about the content of one\u2019s own desires, including whether to care about the well-being of sentient beings that are not (or insufficiently) rational.<a href=\"#fn-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-9\"><sup>[9]</sup></a></p><h1>Objectivist moral realism</h1><p>If someone talks about moral realism without further elaboration, this person is probably<a href=\"#fn-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-10\"><sup>[10]</sup></a> talking about what I here call objectivist moral realism: The view that there are speaker-independent moral facts (ontological moral realism) that hold for each person independently of their personal desires/preferences/goals (objectivism). I also think that objectivism makes for the most straightforward linguistic interpretation of moral claims (although as I argued above, this should in itself not be our main criterion for selecting which positions to pay most attention to).</p><p><strong>Error theory: objectivism\u2019s anti-realist counterpart</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-anti-realism/index.html#ErrThe\"><i>Error theory</i></a> is the moral anti-realist counterpart to objectivist moral realism. (In theory it seems conceivable to me that one can be an error theorist believing that moral discourse is subjectivist or intersubjectivist in nature <i>and</i> is all false, but that would be unusual.) Unlike non-cognitivists, error theorists agree with realists that moral claims are best interpreted as saying things that can be true or false: as being truth-apt. Nevertheless, they deny the realist claim that first-order moral claims can be true. That is to say, error theorists hold that all first-order moral claims are, and must be, false.</p><h2>What brand of objectivism: Are moral facts natural or non-natural facts?</h2><p>There are broadly two types of objectivist realist positions: <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism-moral/\">moral naturalism</a> and <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-non-naturalism/\">moral non-naturalism</a>. They differ with respect to what they take to be the nature of moral facts. In the same way it is true that a bachelor is an unmarried man, moral naturalists believe that that moral terms such as \u2018morally good\u2019 just refer to some natural property or natural properties, such as for instance pleasure or desire fulfillment. By contrast, moral non-naturalists think we will never be able to identify moral terms with natural properties, i.e., they believe that moral terms are <i>basic</i> and mean more than what can be expressed in non-moral language. Moral non-naturalists believe that, at best, we could only discover how non-naturalist moral facts map onto (or \u2018<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/supervenience/\">supervene on</a>\u2019) natural facts.<a href=\"#fn-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-11\"><sup>[11]</sup></a> For instance, we could discover that situations where someone needlessly harms others always involve moral wrongness, but wrongness, thusly interpreted, is not synonymous with needlessly harming others.<a href=\"#fn-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-12\"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p><p>How to distinguish between naturalist and non-naturalist positions can be a subject of extensive debate.<a href=\"#fn-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-13\"><sup>[13]</sup></a> But perhaps the most salient difference between naturalism and non-naturalism is that the two positions tend to be susceptible to different types of challenges. In general, moral realism is backed by the \u2018moral appearances\u2019 (Finlay, 2007) \u2013 our realist intuitions about morality \u2013&nbsp;and challenged by external pressures about how to reconcile realism about morality with what we know about the world and about the mind. Moral naturalism solves this challenge by making concessions (so one could argue) that weaken moral appearances, while moral non-naturalism stays maximally close to these moral appearances.</p><p>But staying so close to the moral appearances creates difficulties in reconciling non-naturalism with the rest of what we know about the world. These difficulties were famously summarized by John Mackie in his <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-anti-realism/moral-error-theory.html\">Argument from Queerness</a>. Queerness is the charge that non-naturalist moral facts, should they exist, would be so different from all the other things we are used to in our conceptual repertoire that we had better think twice about incorporating them at all. The moral facts would be \u201cqueer\u201d because, depending on the (usually non-naturalist) moral realist account in question, they may be causally redundant or impotent, be epistemically inaccessible, or have an (allegedly) mysterious connection to human motivation (see <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/reasons-internal-external/#UndArg\">reasons externalism</a>).</p><p>By contrast, moral naturalism (at least in most versions)<a href=\"#fn-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-14\"><sup>[14]</sup></a> evades these accommodation charges because naturalists believe that moral facts are simply natural facts, and that we could express moral claims in non-moral terminology without necessarily altering the meaning. However, moral naturalists are faced with a different conundrum, summarized in G.E. Moore\u2019s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-question_argument\">Open Question Argument</a>: Simply arguing that moral and non-moral terms are synonymous (e.g. that \"goodness\" and \"desire satisfaction\" or \"happiness\" are synonymous) is dubious. This is because it seems perfectly coherent to ask: \"Sure, this is an example of desire satisfaction, but is it good?\" (Or: \"Sure, this is an example of happiness, but is it good?\" Etc.) For illustration, note that one <i>cannot</i> ask these questions coherently about pairs of terms that are truly synonymous. For example, one cannot say: \"Sure, John is an unmarried man, but is he really a bachelor?\" This question is not coherent because \"bachelor\" and \"unmarried man\" mean the same thing. Thus, moral naturalists have some explaining to do when they they hold that moral and non-moral terms are synonymous.<a href=\"#fn-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-15\"><sup>[15]</sup></a></p><h2>Moral naturalism</h2><p>There are many different versions of moral naturalism and I will focus specifically on just two versions. We will notice that moral naturalist accounts often share strong similarities with subjectivism, even though they are objectivist views. This makes sense because a main challenge for naturalists is to show that they have singled out the <i>right</i> natural facts in their analysis of what is morally good or bad. And one promising way of establishing that one has singled out the right natural facts is by appealing to natural facts that are already of concern to each person individually.</p><p><strong>Example1: \"Action-guiding concepts\"</strong></p><p>The first example of an approach to moral naturalism is exemplified by Aristotelian virtue ethics as endorsed by Philippa Foot (1958) and Paul Bloomfield (as described in Finlay, 2007). Here we are less interested in this position itself, and more in the methodology or approach that motivates the position. Foot and Bloomfield both appeal to biology in determining which natural facts are moral facts; they note that certain things are conducive to the attainment of our biological ends \u2013 e.g. health, well-being, survival \u2013 and others aren\u2019t; and conclude via conceptual analysis that \u2018good\u2019 (and other moral terms) refer to things conducive to the attainment of these ends.</p><p>For instance, in <i>Moral Beliefs</i> (1958), Philippa Foot argues against the idea that \u2018good\u2019 is a non-naturalist concept that solely expresses some kind of positive attitude. She points out that if we <i>did</i> use the term \u2018good\u2019 that way, nothing would prevent a \u201cmoral eccentric\u201d to say that a good man is someone who randomly claps his hands simply because he (the eccentric) approves when people randomly clap their hands. Instead, drawing an analogy to the concept \u2018injury,\u2019 Foot advocates for a specific, substantive understanding of the term \u2018good\u2019 informed by conceptual analysis:</p><blockquote><p>[It] may seem that the only way to make a necessary connexion between 'injury' and the things that are to be avoided, is to say that it is only used in an \"action-guiding sense\" when applied to something the speaker intends to avoid. But we should look carefully at the crucial move in that argument, and query the suggestion that someone might happen not to want anything for which he would need the use of hands or eyes. Hands and eyes, like ears and legs, play a part in so many operations that a man could only be said not to need them if he had no wants at all. That such people exist, in asylums, is not to the present purpose at all; the proper use of his limbs is something a man has reason to want if he wants anything. [...]</p></blockquote><p>It will be noticed that this account of the action-guiding force of 'injury' links it with reasons for acting rather than with actually doing something. Just like our concept for \u2018injury\u2019 has both speaker-independent and \"action-guiding\" features, Foot argues that the same holds for the cardinal virtues prudence, temperance, and courage, and perhaps also of justice. Her theory of moral discourse is that it is discourse about <i>virtues</i>:&nbsp;character traits and dispositions that are beneficial for one\u2019s natural ends. Interestingly enough, Foot notes that according to her view, justice only constitutes a virtue if it benefits the just person. After all, she equates goodness with what is conducive to one\u2019s natural ends, not with e.g. any notion of altruism or of benefiting others. Given that it is unclear whether justice is even a virtue on Foot\u2019s account (as she herself points out), anyone with the intuition that moral discourse is also about considerations of justice \u2013 or simply someone who <i>personally</i> values justice \u2013 might then question whether Foot\u2019s account really captures what is \u2018good,\u2019 and whether we should not rather want to seek justice for its own sake.</p><p><strong>Example2: Subjectivism, impartially extended</strong></p><p>For contrast, we will now consider another naturalist position: that of Peter Railton as outlined in his paper <a href=\"http://fas-philosophy.rutgers.edu/chang/Papers/Railton-MoralRealism.pdf\"><i>Moral Realism</i></a>. While Foot\u2019s account based on conceptual analysis of what we mean by \u2018good\u2019 may fail to be convincing for people with different intuitions, Railton instead tries to establish the meaning of \u2018good\u2019 analytically: What is good for a person is what they would desire if they had full information about all the relevant facts and moral arguments. The advantage of this approach is obvious: Such a reduction of the term \u2018good\u2019 is personally relevant to us by definition. Railton makes two claims:</p><ol><li>Desire fulfillment (assuming we are fully informed when choosing what to want) is what is <i>non-morally good</i> for a person.</li><li>Morality is about what would be non-morally good for everyone (from an \u201cimpartial perspective\u201d).</li></ol><p>With regards to (1), Railton\u2019s position resembles that of the subjectivist Michael Smith: What is good for us is the fulfilment of the desires we\u2019d have if we were fully informed about our situation. What makes Railton\u2019s position different from subjectivism is only that he further holds (2) that there is such a thing as objectivist morality, concerning what is non-morally good <i>for everyone</i>. He writes:</p><blockquote><p>[M]oral resolutions are thought to be determined by criteria of choice that are <i>non-indexical</i> and in some sense <i>comprehensive</i>. This has led a number of philosophers to seek to capture the special character of moral evaluation by identifying a <i>moral point of view</i> that is impartial, but equally concerned with all those potentially affected.</p></blockquote><p>Fixing the content of morality as something \u201cimpartial\u201d is what allows Railton to have objectivist moral facts about what is good (for everyone) even though his conception of what is valuable for any given person only depends on their personal desires. Interestingly enough, Railton\u2019s moral realism does not come with any rationally binding recommendations for how to act. His theory has an axiological component (axiology being the study of what is valuable), postulating objective value. But his theory has no deontic component (he does not believe in objective moral <i>obligations</i>).</p><p>Railton uses the slogan \u201crationality does go relative when it goes instrumental, but epistemology need not follow.\u201c In other words: While there is no direct reason to act morally for any one individual because rationality \u2013 <i>procedurally</i> interpreted<a href=\"#fn-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-16\"><sup>[16]</sup></a> \u2013 only concerns itself with drawing proper inferences from one\u2019s pre-existing desires, there are nevertheless facts about what <i>would</i> make society good or bad from a perspective of maximizing desire fulfillment for all individuals. Whether to act morally is optional and up to one\u2019s own desires, but reasoning <i>about</i> morality, on a purely epistemic level, can be done with an objective foundation.</p><h3>Moral naturalism is often vague. Is there a single correct notion of what is good for someone?</h3><p>The above may feel like a disappointing conclusion from a paper titled <i>Moral Realism</i>. Railton himself notes that people might object that his view \u201cmay not make morality serious enough.\u201d Having said that, personally I am happy to call positions that postulate only an axiology (and no moral obligations) moral realism \u2013 <i>provided</i> that there really is one uniquely correct, compelling axiology,&nbsp;as opposed to many different ways of determining what is \u201cgood for everyone\u201d depending on different specifications of what constitutes (moral or non-moral) goodness.</p><p>The problem I see with Railton\u2019s position specifically is that it is in several respects <i>under-defined</i>. For instance, it could turn out to be very difficult to formalize a uniquely compelling notion of \u201cdesires\u201d or \u201cdesires given full information\u201d that captures all our intuitions about when desire satisfaction is or is not valuable. Furthermore, Railton\u2019s account cannot easily be extended to taking a stance about <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/ARRFGA\">population ethics</a> and does not specify a precise notion of what it means to take an \u201cimpartial perspective.\"Railton considers this to be an advantage:</p><blockquote><p>By itself, the equation of moral rightness with rationality from a social point of view is not terribly restrictive, for, depending upon what one takes rationality to be, this equation could be made by a utilitarian, a Kantian, or even a non-cognitivist. That is as it should be, for if it is to capture what is distinctive about moral norms, it should be compatible with the broadest possible range of recognized moral theories.</p></blockquote><p>However, not committing to any specific perspective calls into question whether there even is, in theory, a correct answer. If there are many different and roughly equally plausible interpretations of \u201cimpartial perspective\u201d or \u201cdesire fulfillment\u201d (or more generally: of <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/well-being/#MooCha\"><i>well-being</i></a> defined as \u201cthat which is good for a person\u201d), then the question, \u201cWhich of these different accounts is <i>correct</i>?\u201d&nbsp;may not have an answer.</p><p>What Railton shows is that there is at least one (vague) view about what to call \u201cgood for everyone\u201d that is <i>plausible</i> or <i>defensible</i>. And we know there are some views about this that are obviously false. This is already a lot to show, as it counters a position of extreme moral skepticism saying that there is <i>no sense at all</i> in which we can reason objectively about morality.</p><p>Nevertheless, Railton\u2019s position is not quite what I would be inclined to call moral realism. It leaves too much open for interpretation because we can focus on widely different criteria when trying to systematize what doing good for others comes down to. What I am interested in is whether there is more to it: Can we show that there is a view that is not only defensible, but <i>uniquely correct</i>? In the last section, I will describe what conditions a Railton-like view would have to meet for me to count it as moral realism.</p><h2>Moral non-naturalism</h2><p>Whatever we think of non-naturalist moral realism, it is certainly ambitious. Finlay calls it the \u201c<i>normative</i> face of moral realism\u201d because it is committed to the existence of irreducibly normative moral facts. What is attractive about non-naturalism is that the other versions of moral realism appear to be somewhat watered down by contrast. Non-naturalism is arguably best able to capture the urgency attached to the sentiment that some things <i>really</i> are right or wrong.</p><p>Support for moral non-naturalism has been growing lately. Finlay (2007) writes:</p><blockquote><p>Although long considered an absurd Platonism, [non-naturalism] today enjoys a renaissance and boasts many and distinguished champions. [...] Besides Scanlon and Shafer-Landau, contemporary philosophers who defend non-naturalism (although not all under that label) include Thomas Nagel, Derek Parfit, Jonathan Dancy, Joseph Raz, Jean Hampton, Philip Stratton-Lake, Colin McGinn, Terence Cuneo, David Enoch, Michael Huemer, and William Fitzpatrick.</p></blockquote><p>The non-naturalist position about moral facts is often inspired by Moore\u2019s Open Question Argument. Shafer-Landau, for instance, believes that \u201cMoore was correct in thinking that we could always intelligibly question the propriety of any candidate naturalistic reduction [of moral terms]\u201d (Shafer-Landau, 2003, pos. 738). This leaves two options: Either we accept that there is no speaker-independent normativity, or we regard it as a separate realm not reducible to physical facts.<a href=\"#fn-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-17\"><sup>[17]</sup></a> Shafer-Landau and other non-naturalist philosophers have opted to go for the latter (although what this means exactly can differ from account to account, and sometimes the difference between non-naturalism and naturalism is subtle).</p><p>Next to the strong intuition that moral naturalism is inadequate to deal with the moral appearances, both Parfit and Shafer-Landau also defend moral realism by drawing analogies between morality and other domains about which (allegedly convincing) realist interpretations have been forwarded. For instance, Shafer-Landau points out \u201cpartners in crime\u201d within the philosophy of logic/mathematics, and philosophy itself (Shafer-Landau, 2007, pos. 646):</p><blockquote><p>[...] my kind of realism must seek out partners in crime. I would point to correct logical standards or physical laws (assuming a realist construal of such things), and claim that there isn't anything that makes such things true \u2013 they simply are true.</p></blockquote><p>And also from the philosophy of mind (Shafer-Landau, 2007, pos. 949):</p><blockquote><p>The sort of non-naturalism that I find appealing is one that bears a very close structural parallel to certain non-reductionist theories in the philosophy of mind. According to these latter views, mental properties are not identical to physical ones; mental facts are not physical facts; but mental properties are realized by instantiations of physical properties. At least in worlds relevantly close to ours, there would be no mental life without the physical stuff that constitutes it.</p></blockquote><p>We can however ask whether these partners in crime really function analogously, and whether realist accounts of them are even correct. As Hallvard Lillehammer notes in his <a href=\"https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/moral-realism-a-defense/\">review</a> of Shafer-Landau\u2019s <i>Moral Realism: A Defense</i>, \u201cPerhaps the most interesting thing about these alleged companions in guilt is that none of them are obviously innocent.\u201d</p><p>Another question is how we could come to know anything about the normative realm, since it is separate from everything else (cf. the <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism-mathematics/#EpiAcc\">Benacerraf-Field problem</a> in the philosophy of mathematics).</p><p>Finally, a third challenge is that, assuming for the moment that we grant the existence of non-naturalist moral facts, moral skeptics can challenge whether these facts are really action-relevant for them. In response, Shafer-Landau advocates moral rationalism, the view that \u201cmoral obligations are or entail reasons for action.\u201d On this account, moral beliefs are on their own capable of motivating someone, but may not always be decisive for motivation.</p><h1>Moral realism worthy of the name: Two proposals</h1><p>I am most interested in accounts of moral realism which, should they prove to be correct, will be highly relevant to people\u2019s lives and life projects: either directly because they are inherently compelling (they provide \u2018real\u2019 reasons to act), or because they are compelling at least for those people interested in pursuing goals motivated by altruism (\"doing good for others\"). With this in mind, I will now describe two different ways in which I could be convinced of moral realism.</p><h2>One Compelling Axiology</h2><p>Drawing from the above discussion, I would call myself a moral realist if I could be convinced that there is One Compelling Axiology in the form of a <i>more developed and ambitious</i> version of Railton\u2019s naturalist position.<a href=\"#fn-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-18\"><sup>[18]</sup></a> Such a view, as I envisage it, would combine a specific, complete theory about what is objectively in someone\u2019s own interest, or is good or bad for them, with a specific, complete theory of what it means to do good for others from a kind of \u201cimpartial perspective.\u201d (Which beings qualify as morally relevant \u201cothers\u201d is also something the One Compelling Axiology would have to tell us; as is whether to only count people who exist currently or will exist regardless of our actions or whether to also intrinsically count the creation of new beings.)</p><p>As a loose (and untestable, at least not with current-day technology) criterion for what makes this form of realism true, I stipulate that I would count&nbsp;something as&nbsp;the One Compelling Axiology if all philosophers or philosophically-inclined reasoners, after having engaged in philosophical reflection under ideal conditions,<a href=\"#fn-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-19\"><sup>[19]</sup></a> would deem the search for the One Compelling Axiology to be a sufficiently precise, non-ambiguous undertaking for them to have made up their minds rather than \u201crejected the question,\u201d and if these people would all come to largely the same conclusions. If the result was near-unanimous agreement about a highly specific view, I would count this as strong moral realism being true.</p><p>Note that this proposal makes no claims about the linguistic level: I\u2019m not saying that ordinary moral discourse let\u2019s us <i>define</i> morality as convergence in people\u2019s moral views after philosophical reflection under ideal conditions. (This would be a circular definition.) Instead, I am focusing on the aspect&nbsp;that such convergence&nbsp;would be practically relevant: If maximally well-equipped and well-informed people were all to come to the same conclusion of what it means to \u201cdo what is good for others\u201d no matter the idiosyncrasies they started out with, then \u2013 assuming I find the prospect of doing what is good for others appealing \u2013 I have little reason to assume that my current thoughts on the matter of morality are better than the current thoughts of someone who holds intuitions I find radically counterintuitive. This would be important to know!<a href=\"#fn-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-20\"><sup>[20]</sup></a> I place no constraints on the possible outcomes of moral convergence, whether what is deemed good or bad for a person or a sentient being involves experiences, desire satisfaction, an objective list of things (e.g. friendship, love, exploration, etc.), or something we haven\u2019t yet considered. The important point is that it needs to be a notion of well-being or \u201cgood for someone\u201d that is widely compelling, not just as one defensible way of how to use the words \u201cgood for someone,\u201d but as a compelling account of what is best for a person (or for a sentient being). A successful proposal has to give precise answers to questions such as which beings (or <a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/which-computations-do-i-care-about/\">computations</a>) matter morally (and how much?), or what the correct stance is on <a href=\"http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2%3A170236&amp;dswid=-7569\">population ethics</a> or <a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/ethics/infinite.pdf\">aggregation in an infinite universe</a>. For all these questions, the position would have to yield compelling arguments for why to take exactly one particular view as opposed to other plausible views. (This may sound overly demanding, but note that ideal conditions for philosophical reflection means having access to everything one can coherently ask for, including e.g. a well-intentioned, superintelligent oracle AI.)</p><p>The main challenge for moral realism in the form of a One Compelling Axiology is overcoming philosophical disagreement between sophisticated reasoners. There are several theories of well-being, and several notions of impartiality, that are internally coherent and highly intuitively appealing to at least some people. These theories are mutually contradictory.<a href=\"#fn-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-21\"><sup>[21]</sup></a></p><h2>Irreducible normativity</h2><p>The other way I could become convinced of moral realism in the sense that I mean it is if, inspired by moral non-naturalism, I became convinced that irreducible normativity is a meaningful and somehow rationally binding (on some conception of rationality I currently find strange to envision). This would roughly correspond to moral non-naturalism being true. (Some people distinguish moral reasons from prudential reasons, whereas I tend to use the adjective 'moral' in a broader sense that relates to all one\u2019s goals, both altruistic and non-altruistic, and generally to that which matters in one\u2019s life. Since irreducible normativity also covers egoistic goals, it is broader than&nbsp;narrow-sense morality.) The challenges I see for a convincing account of irreducible normativity are threefold:</p><ol><li>How to justify the existence of a realm of normative facts separate from the physical</li><li>How to reliably gain epistemic access to normative facts, should they indeed exist</li><li>Whether irreducible normativity is really a meaningful concept</li></ol><p>My next post will focus specifically on irreducible normativity, where I will explain the concept in much more detail (insofar as I can manage to understand others' views on it).</p><h1>Acknowledgments</h1><p>Many people helped me with this post, but I want to specifically&nbsp;thank&nbsp;Simon Knutsson for important advice on earlier drafts that&nbsp;greatly improved the direction I went for with this post.</p><p>My work on this post was funded by the <a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/\">Center on Long-Term Risk.</a></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://longtermrisk.org/files/logo-1.png\"></figure><h1>Sources</h1><p>Chalmers, D.

That is, they use \u2018metaethics\u2019 to refer to what I would call calling \u2018normative ethics\u2019 (or perhaps the best description would be \u201cfiguring out what humans value through philosophy and cognitive science\u201d). Within academic philosophy, metaethics is the study of moral claims: what moral claims do or don\u2019t assert and whether these assertions are sometimes true. The questions of whether e.g. utilitarianism is true, or whether human values are complex, are less likely to come up in a discussion about metaethics. Of course, metaethics is <i>indirectly</i> very relevant to all these questions and informs, for instance, whether inquiries into finding the \u2018right\u2019 human values or the \u2018right\u2019 version of consequentialism are well-posed questions. And it seems plausible to me that, according to some metaethical views, \u201cfiguring out what humans value through philosophy and cognitive science\u201d is indeed how we should be doing <i>normative</i> ethics. <a href=\"#fnref-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-1\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p><p><strong>[2]</strong> According to pragmatism, a brand of philosophy that emphasizes the practical nature of ethics/life/everything and thereby \u2013 so one might argue \u2013 blurs the distinction between what is the case and what is practically useful, moral claims are \u2018true\u2019 not when they describe speaker-independent moral facts, rules or values, but when they result from \u201ccorrect processes for solving practical problems\u201d (Finlay, 2007). <a href=\"#fnref-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-2\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p><p><strong>[3]</strong> Quoting from the SEP <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-realism/\">Moral realism entry</a>: <i>\"Yet, with the development of (what has come to be called) minimalism about talk of truth and fact, it might seem that this characterization makes being a moral realist easier than it should be. As minimalism would have it, saying that some claim is true is just a way of (re-)asserting the claim and carries no commitment beyond that expressed by the original claim. Thus, if one is willing to claim that \u201cmurdering innocent children for fun is wrong\u201d one can comfortably claim as well that that \u201cmurdering innocent children for fun is wrong is true\u201d without thereby taking on any additional metaphysical baggage.\"</i> <a href=\"#fnref-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-3\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p><p><strong>[4]</strong> This criticism applies to many instances where philosophers do <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/concepts/#AttConAna\">conceptual analysis</a>. See also Luke Muehlhauser\u2019s <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2YPbdHgcjt7g5ZaFN/conceptual-analysis-and-moral-theory\">post on conceptual analysis and metaethics</a>, or section 6 of <a href=\"http://consc.net/papers/verbal.pdf\">this paper</a> by David Chalmers. In short, the problems with using conceptual analysis to establish normative conclusions are threefold: Firstly, there may be no uniquely typical set of intuitions about the \u2018correct\u2019 usage of moral terminology. Secondly, ordinary usage may often be underspecified, because most people are not rigorously trained moral philosophers. Thirdly, even if the vast majority of people <i>did</i> use moral terminology a certain way, this would not necessarily mean that they would be using it the most useful or most \u2018right\u2019 way (provided the moral realist premise that there <i>is</i> a uniquely right way). As an antidote to approaches anchored in the tradition of conceptual analysis, Chalmers makes the following proposal (\u201cX\u201d refers to concepts such as \u2018knowledge,\u2019 \u2018moral,\u2019 and \u2018science\u2019 that are difficult to define):\u2019 <i>\"On the picture I favor, instead of asking \u201cWhat is X\u201d, one should focus on the roles one wants X to play, and see what can play that role. The roles in question here may in principle be properties of all sorts: so one focuses on the properties one wants X to have, and figures out what has those properties. But very frequently, they will be causal roles, normative roles, and especially explanatory roles.\"</i> <a href=\"#fnref-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-4\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p><p><strong>[5]</strong> See also Kahane (2013) for the same point argued for at length. <a href=\"#fnref-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-5\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p><p><strong>[6]</strong> It is important to note that Finlay uses the adjective \u2018ontological\u2019 in a weak sense. Derek Parfit (2011) defended a metaethical view he called Non-Ontological Cognitivism: Both mathematical talk and moral talk can be objectively true, but there are no mathematical or moral entities. Note that, according to Finlay\u2019s typology, this would still count as ontological moral realism because Finlay\u2019s definition liberally counts externalist reasons as (abstract) \u2018moral entities.\u2019 <a href=\"#fnref-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-6\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p><p><strong>[7]</strong> Constructivism as a metaethical view is different from constructivism as a position in normative ethics. Tim Scanlon (2012), for instance, is a constructivist as regards normative ethics; however, his <i>metaethical</i> position is objectivist moral non-naturalism. Scanlon believes, like Parfit and Shafer-Landau, that there are irreducibly normative reasons about what people ought to do. He further believes that constructivism as an approach to normative ethics helps us determine which reasons are correct. But the question to be answered in the end is which reasons are <i>really</i> correct, rather than which reasons are correctly the output of a well-specified constructive function. <a href=\"#fnref-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-7\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p><p><strong>[8]</strong> Especially the \u201ckingdom of ends\u201d formulation of Kant\u2019s categorical imperative suggests this interpretation. What follows is my own translation from German (Kant, 1986[1785]). Note that in producing this translation, I had to make several substantial judgment calls. <i>\"The idea that every rational being is compelled to regard itself as an arbiter of universalizable norms, in order to evaluate itself and its actions from this perspective, leads us to a related and extraordinarily fruitful concept, namely that of a realm of ends. Under a realm of ends, I understand the systematic connection between rational beings through collectively shared norms. Because ends are determined by the universal validity of these norms, it follows that, if one abstracts from the personal differences between rational beings and from the content of their personal ends, then we can think up a systematically connected whole that encompasses all ends (including both the rational beings as ends in themselves and the ends that any rational being may set for itself), i.e., a realm of ends, which we can conceive according to the aforementioned principles.\"</i><br>To be clear, I am not saying that Kantianism is best interpreted as making claims that are related to current discussions of non-causal decision theories. I think there are several aspects of Kantianism that go against this interpretation. I am only saying that there are interesting parallels, and that, if one wants to, one could make a case for such an interpretation (or extension) of Kantianism. <a href=\"#fnref-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-8\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p><p><strong>[9]</strong> Peter Carruthers, for instance, has argued on contractualist grounds against animals' having rights (<a href=\"http://faculty.philosophy.umd.edu/pcarruthers/Blurb-AI.htm\">Carruthers, 1992</a>). There are, however, <i>some</i> constructivists who endorse animals having rights, most notably Christine Korsgaard (<a href=\"http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~korsgaar/CMK.Animal.Rights.pdf\">2012</a>). <a href=\"#fnref-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-9\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p><p><strong>[10]</strong> Alternatively, someone may have in mind an even more restrictive definition of moral realism \u2013 what is sometimes called \u2018robust moral realism\u2019 \u2013 that only refers to a subtype of objectivism: moral non-naturalism. This definition focuses on whether there are facts that are <i>irreducibly normative</i>. (See the subsection on moral non-naturalism, as well as posts 2 through 4 in this sequence.) <a href=\"#fnref-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-10\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p><p><strong>[11]</strong> Note that some non-naturalists, such as Shafer-Landau, think that moral properties are realizable by many different \u2018constellations\u2019 of natural properties. Moral pluralism as a normative view is arguably more attractive for non-naturalists than it is for naturalists because naturalists seem to be committed to a one-to-one relationship between goodness and some other natural property (Shafer-Landau, 2003, pos. 1215). <a href=\"#fnref-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-11\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p><p><strong>[12] </strong>As an analogy: Displaying a particular <i>image</i> on a computer screen is not synonymous with displaying a specific <i>configuration of pixels</i> on the computer screen, because the image \u2013 at least when viewed subjectively at a macroscopic level with human-level vision \u2013 is realizable via many different pixel configurations. The picture \u201csupervenes\u201d on the pixel configurations. The analogy is imperfect because an image really is nothing more than the sum of its pixels, and a picture that is slightly but percievablly different from another picture is just that, <i>another</i> picture. With non-naturalist morality, going from a constellation of physical facts that does not form a moral category to a constellation that does form a moral category must make for a <i>sharp boundary</i> somehow. However, because we cannot articulate, with reference to physical facts alone, what this sharp boundary signifies, it seems strange or \u201cqueer\u201d to think that such a boundary even exists in a meaningful and action-relevant sense. <a href=\"#fnref-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-12\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p><p><strong>[13]</strong> The <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/moral-non-naturalism/\">SEP entry</a> on moral non-naturalism reads: \u201cThere may be as much philosophical controversy about how to distinguish naturalism from non-naturalism as there is about which view is correct. [...] Perhaps the most vexing problem for any general characterization of non-naturalism is the bewildering array of ways in which the distinction between natural and non-natural properties has been drawn.\u201d <a href=\"#fnref-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-13\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p><p><strong>[14]</strong> An exception is <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism-moral/#CorRea\">Cornell Realism</a>, a version of naturalism that holds that moral facts, although natural, cannot be reduced to other natural facts. Cornell realists claim that their position avoids the Open Question Argument that threatens other versions of naturalism. (See also endnote 16.) <a href=\"#fnref-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-14\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p><p><strong>[15]</strong> One might think that the Open Question Argument leaves open the option of moral facts and natural facts merely being <i>coextensional</i>, i.e., that they refer to the same thing but via different routes. However, some philosophers (and myself) believe that if two concepts are coextensional in every possible world, that just means that they are synonymous. <a href=\"#fnref-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-15\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p><p><strong>[16]</strong> Many moral realists reject the procedural account of rationality (which corresponds to the way \u2018rationality\u2019 is used on LessWrong: cognitive skills that help to achieve whatever goals one already endorses) in favor of what they call <i>substantive</i> rationality. On the substantive account, being rational may for instance entail having the right dispositions to apprehend or be motivated by externalist reasons for action. The belief in substantive rationality therefore tends to go together with reasons externalism. (And one may argue that this is circular: it defines substantive rationality with respect to externalist reasons, and externalist reasons with respect to substantive rationality.) <a href=\"#fnref-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-16\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p><p><strong>[17]</strong> As a third option, we may accept that normativity is nothing over and above the physical, but that it cannot be defined in terms of the physical easily, any more than a stock market can be defined in terms of the physical. This position describes non-reductionist moral naturalism, a view that is usually associated with Cornell Realism (cf. footnote 13), but not limited to it (see, Sinhababu, 2018). However, just like I think there is nothing of relevance that depends on whether we call ourselves \u201crealists\u201d about the stock market or not, I fail to see how such a position would be relevant to our lives if it were true. (I suppose it would be relevant insofar as it may come with metaphysical baggage of rejecting <a href=\"http://crucialconsiderations.org/philosophy/what-is-reductionism/\">reductionism</a> in general, which might change how we approach philosophical questions.) <a href=\"#fnref-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-17\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p><p><strong>[18]</strong> It need not be <i>exactly</i> like Railton\u2019s position. Railton endorses some notion of desire fulfillment as what is good for a person. Another version of moral realism, one that I would&nbsp;consider to be \u201cmoral realism worthy of the name\u201d in the One Compelling Axiology sense, is moral realism based on the idea that experiences&nbsp;can be intrinsically morally valuable or disvaluable. Proponents of such views (one example being &nbsp;<i>hedonism</i>) believe that phenomenological introspection can tell us about pleasure\u2019s (moral) goodness or pain\u2019s (moral) badness (see e.g.: Hewitt, 2008 &amp; Sinhababu, 2010). I will discuss moral realism based on phenomenological introspection in my seventh post in this sequence. <a href=\"#fnref-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-18\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p><p><strong>[19] </strong>By \u201cideal conditions\u201d, I am envisioning a scenario that is perfectly suited for making progress on questions of philosophy. Imagine a setup that covers everyone\u2019s needs and also provides access to all of the following: the world\u2019s best (and most usefully organized) library or online library;<br>revived versions of history\u2019s greatest moral philosophers;<br>contemporary philosophers eager to discuss their issues of expertise;<br>oracle artificial superintelligence intent on charitably (and <i>passively</i>) helping out by answering any well-posed questions;<br>life extension (in case one needs more than an ordinary lifetime to properly reflect);<br>advanced nootropics (so people could think faster or more accurately);<br>mind-altering technology (to e.g. experience what it is like to have different moral intuitions or experience yet-unknown states of mind);<br>etc., things <i>in that spirit.</i><br>Furthermore, there would be some mechanism in place to gently break up epistemically unhealthy group dynamics (for example, if charismatic people\u2019s influence on others\u2019 opinions was disproportionate). Alternatively, the journey could also be undertaken in solitude. In general, we could imagine a mechanism in place to prevent anything that radically alters the intuitions and goals of our would-be philosophers in ways that are not intended. Needless to say, there is no uniquely correct notion of \u201cideal conditions for philosophical reflection,\u201d and if different plausible setups lead to radically different results, that would just be an additional way in which moral realism via One Compelling Axiology could fail. <a href=\"#fnref-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-19\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p><p><strong>[20]</strong> Someone may object that it doesn\u2019t matter to them what the vast majority of people would conclude after philosophical reflection, because they have <i>their own</i> intuitions about what it means to do good for others, and because moral convergence is not necessarily the same as moral <i>truth</i>. I think&nbsp;this is a legitimate argument in a situation where people are pursuing different questions: If some people associate morality with words like \u2018excitement,\u2019 whereas other people associate it more with \u2018seriousness,\u2019 maybe that just means they are envisioning different things and are answering different questions when trying to systematize their moral intuitions. However, in the One Compelling Axiology scenario, I stipulate that there is agreement about what the question is, and that people who are relevantly similar to oneself with respect to how they approach existential questions <i>also</i> convergence on the same answer as everyone else. In <i>that</i> case, it would be weird to consider this fact irrelevant to one\u2019s personal thinking about what it means to do good for others. <a href=\"#fnref-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-20\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p><p><strong>[21]</strong> Note that just because there may not be a One Compelling Axiology does not mean that we should not expect ideal conditions for philosophical reflection to be useful, or that we should think that there is no difference between obviously silly views about what matters and views that are plausible or defensible.&nbsp;I think of the difference between&nbsp;well-done and poorly-done moral reasoning as a continuum with different peaks, representing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3zDX3f3QTepNeZHGc/pluralistic-moral-reductionism\">different questions being asked</a>. Rejecting&nbsp;One Compelling Axiology&nbsp;only means that we need to put in more legwork upfront in order to decide what types of questions we want to answer, but it does not mean that&nbsp;<i>everything</i>&nbsp;related to moral-philosophical practice is useless. <a href=\"#fnref-QPb6KEroyaYiKN6fq-21\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>", "user": {"username": "Lukas_Gloor"}}, {"_id": "x8yrkBqwAT468D4gK", "title": "Do Prof Eva Vivalt's results show 'evidence-based' development isn't all it's cut out to be?", "postedAt": "2018-05-21T16:28:27.239Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>I <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/eva-vivalt-social-science-generalizability/\">recently interviewed</a> a member of the EA community - Prof Eva Vivalt - at length about her research&#xA0;into&#xA0;the value of using trials in medical and social science to inform development work.

In this blog post I do so and demonstrate why we&#x2019;re like the <a href=\"https://www.smbc-comics.com/comic/elephant-in-the-room\">blind men touching different parts of the elephant</a>, and how if we put all of it together, we&#x2019;ll be able to make much better decisions.</p>\n<p><strong>Poverty</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Talent gap - Small (~10 people)</li>\n<li>Money gap - Large (~<a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2017/11/27/our-top-charities-for-giving-season-2017/\">$86 million</a> = ~1720 people doing E2G)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Animal rights</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Talent gap - Large (~100+ people)</li>\n<li>Money gap - Mixed (depends on agreement with <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/lewis-bollard\">Lewis Bollard</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Artificial intelligence</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Talent gap - Middle (~50 people)</li>\n<li>Money gap - Small (most projects are very well funded)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Meta organizations</strong> (that fall outside of one of the above areas.)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Talent gap - Small (~20 people)</li>\n<li>Money gap - Mixed (depends on agreement with <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/nick-beckstead\">Nick Beckstead</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I am not extremely confident on all these numbers (particularly the size of the AI talent gap), but I am confident of the broader claim that the gaps are different between cause areas, and we would all benefit from making that distinction in public discourse. I am happy to update these as people make good arguments for them in the comments. Below I&#x2019;ll go into further details of how I came to these estimates.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Poverty talent gap</strong></p>\n<p>In my experience, poverty organizations generally hire outside of the EA movement for many roles. There are still small gaps for some poverty organizations hiring management and leadership roles from the EA pool (~4). There are also some gaps in operational talent (~2). A part of this gap also comes from the possibility of founding more effective poverty charities (~4), such as a <a href=\"http://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/blog/tobacco-taxation\">tobacco taxation</a> or <a href=\"http://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/blog/conditional-cash-transfers\">conditional cash transfer</a> charity, like what has been done with <a href=\"http://charitysciencehealth.com/\">Charity Science Health</a> and <a href=\"http://www.fortifyhealth.global/\">Fortify Health</a>.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Poverty money gap</strong></p>\n<p>The gap for money in poverty is huge, even when only looking at charities significantly stronger than Give Directly, whose gap is very large and arguably virtually unlimited. The gap is close to $100 million after Good Ventures funds its portion. There is also reason to expect this gap to grow with recent changes in Good Venture&#x2019;s funding plans and a strong group of incubation charities in GiveWell&#x2019;s system. This gap only grows if you think there are strong opportunities in poverty outside of GiveWell&#x2019;s list. Assuming donating 50% of a $100,000 salary, it would easily take 1,720 people doing E2G to fill this gap. And that is not even including new Givewell incubated/recommended charities!</p>\n<p><strong>Animal rights talent gap</strong></p>\n<p>The talent gap for animal rights is very large. Many AR organizations are hiring and trying to grow as fast as possible. There is also considerable scope for entrepreneurship and founding new and effective animal rights organizations. The animal rights community as a whole is very small and the number of EAs in the movement is even more limited.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Animal rights money gap</strong></p>\n<p>Historically animal rights has been chronically hampered by insufficient funding across the movement. However the entrance of Open Phil to the area has created a very different situation. I now categorize the funding gaps as mixed. The funding is fairly centralized between Open Phil and the AR Funds being run by the same person (Lewis), which controls nearly 50% of all funding in AR. If you have strong agreement with Lewis about the priorities in the area, I would say the funding gap is small. However, if you have very different views, then the funding gap could be seen as large.</p>\n<p><strong>Artificial intelligence talent gap</strong></p>\n<p>The talent gap for Artificial intelligence is middling, with many organizations in the field in need of researchers as well as some gaps in meta-organizations focusing on meta-research. There are also significant gaps in operational talent to help the support structures of these organizations.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Artificial intelligence money gap</strong></p>\n<p>The money gap for AI organizations seems very small, with even large funders being turned away from many projects. Many organizations have very large amounts of funding, and given the recent changes in publicity, much like animal rights, AI went from being chronically underfunded to well funded in almost all areas. Furthermore, due to the fairly wide spread of funders, even people with more unique perspectives on AI will find it hard to find good gaps.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Meta organizations talent gap</strong></p>\n<p>Importantly in this section, I mostly consider meta organizations that do not fall under another cause area. For example, ACE would fall under animal rights, not under meta. The talent gap for these organizations generally seems small, with some posted roles in leadership (~7), operations (~3), research (~3) and other general roles (~3) across organizations. There seems to be some scope for founding new charities as well (~4).&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Meta organizations money gap</strong></p>\n<p>Much like animal rights, there&apos;s a lot of centralization of funding with a handful of funders controlling a very high percentage of total funding. Like in animal rights, there is one person who controls the EA funds on meta-organizations and is the lead investigator for Open Phil. Thus I think an EA&#x2019;s perspectives on funding gaps will largely depend on how well their views align with Nick Beckstead&#x2019;s. This gap can range from very small to moderate sized (low millions) depending on how broadly you define meta-organizations.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Overall, as you can see, the talent and money gaps vary largely depending on the cause. If you think poverty is the highest impact area, earning to give is a very good choice. On the other hand, if you think animal rights is the best, figuring out how to best give your talents might be a better way forward. If you agree with Lewis, that is. Regardless of what cause you think is highest priority and what you think the gaps truly are, breaking them down by cause area will help everybody make better decisions.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "katherinesavoie"}}, {"_id": "JoezRXNpNGrm8f8nP", "title": "Employee Giving incentives: A shared database... relevant for EA job-seekers and activists", "postedAt": "2018-05-19T09:37:01.877Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>At&#xA0;innovationsinfundraising.org we&apos;ve put together a <a href=\"http://innovationsinfundraising.org/doku.php?id=iifwiki:employee_giving_schemes\">database</a>&#xA0;of&#xA0;information on what each of the firms in the FTSE100 do to encourage and support employee charitable giving. &#xA0;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do they &apos;match&apos;&#xA0; employee donations,&#xA0; and if so what are the rules for this (caps, maximums, restrictions)?</li>\n<li>Do they have a &apos;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/payroll-giving\">Payroll Giving</a>&apos;&#xA0; scheme set up, and if so who administers it,&#xA0; and how do they promote it?</li>\n<li>Does the company endorse a particular charity or set of charities,&#xA0; and if so how do they choose this?</li>\n<li>What are the results... how much has been raised?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>As far as we can see this is the first time this information has been made publicly available in a single place.&#xA0; This is meant to be a collaborative, evolving resource, not a static one-time thing.

So, for instance, we could help a human for $1,000 and a chicken for $1 and then face the decision which one to prioritise.</p>\n<p>This comes down to questions of whether we value chickens, on what grounds we would value humans and not chickens, and how much exactly we should value chickens if we do value them. So, if you value chickens 10% as much as humans, you might want to decide in favour of chickens, and if you do not value chickens at all, helping the humans would be a much better decision.</p>\n<p>We can think of these two outlooks as two different &quot;worldviews&quot;. While I do not have a clear definition of that term (Holden himself says that the concept is &quot;a very fuzzy idea&quot;), relevant features of worldviews are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each yields particular outcomes (e.g. &quot;prioritise X&quot;) that are very different from those of other worldviews.</li>\n<li>These different outcomes might hinge on answering just one question differently (e.g. &quot;Do chickens have moral value?&quot;), or perhaps a few crucial questions.</li>\n<li>Worldviews are constituted by a combination of views and beliefs that are not only normative, but also empirical, which makes it <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/worldview-diversification\">difficult to disentangle</a> claims they make when we want to deal with uncertainty about worldviews (thanks to Max Daniel for pointing this out).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the next section, I will discuss moral uncertainty, that is, uncertainties between first-order normative theories (such as Virtue Ethics, Hedonistic Utilitarianism, or Kantianism). This does not mean that I think that worldviews and normative theories are the same thing, even though I think we can apply measures of uncertainty to them in similar ways. I will also use the more neutral term &quot;view&quot;, whenever I do not think it is important to distinguish the two terms.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h1>The worldview split problem on an individual basis</h1>\n<p>Let&apos;s assume the fictitious graduate mentioned above (let&apos;s call her Lisa) has to pick a single option, for example in deciding which cause to devote her career to. When making this choice, it seems reasonable to not go for the option she likes most, but to also take into account how certain she is that each of the worldviews she derives the options from is correct.</p>\n<p>This kind of thinking is what motivates the methods which Will uses in <a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MacAskill-Normative-Uncertainty.pdf\">his thesis on normative uncertainty</a>. He discusses examples in which agents have to weigh options which are ordered differently according to different normative theories, while being uncertain as to which of the theories is correct.</p>\n<p>These decision-situations include a decision-maker at a specific point in time, who has at her disposal</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a set of possible options (actions she can perform),</li>\n<li>a set of theories that give an ordering of the options in terms of their choice-worthiness (whether, and sometimes, how much an option is preferred),</li>\n<li>and a credence function that assigns each theory a subjective likelihood of being true.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This process is analogous to expected utility calculation, replacing &quot;expected utility&quot; with &quot;expected choice-worthiness&quot;.</p>\n<p>Below, I will apply these methods - ways of calculating and maximising expected choice-worthiness - to the case of different worldviews and see whether it is helpful in dealing with the kinds of &quot;worldview split problems&quot; discussed above.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h1>Finding theories behind the worldviews</h1>\n<p>One major difficulty in assigning credences to worldviews is that often it is not clear what exactly constitutes a worldview. In this section, I explain why in the comparison further down, I am using the distinction between person-affecting and impersonal views to rank options. Feel free to skip to the next section if you don&apos;t want to hear all the details!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nonidentity-problem/#Puz\">Person-affecting</a> views capture the intuition that an act can be bad only if it is bad for someone, while impersonal views aim to maximize total (net) wellbeing.</p>\n<p>The reason I searched for a different split in worldviews is that just attributing one worldview to each option made the whole prioritising framework uninformative: if our worldview is &quot;I should care most about humans alive today&quot; and one option is &quot;do whatever is best for humans alive today&quot;, the framework&apos;s results will always be aligned with the worldview we assign highest credence to. If we assign this credence mainly based on intuition, we end up with what we would do if we just went for whatever we like best.</p>\n<p>What I did to get around this was to note down some things someone might plausibly care about, and try to cluster them into more informative categories.</p>\n<h5>Things Lisa cares about:</h5>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Pursuing paths of action that produce <strong>good consequences</strong>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Trying to <strong>cultivate care</strong> for others. This works well for other humans, somewhat for animals, but breaks down when we think about alien minds.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Capability to suffer</strong> as a very important aspect in who we assign moral value to.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Self-improvement</strong>: this includes virtues of good conduct in interaction with others, virtues like wisdom aimed at improving the way one makes decisions, and a general striving to become a better person.&#xA0;</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition, a flourishing world in which beings are happy, satisfy their preferences, and realise a variety of values seems like something worth caring about.</p>\n<p>A lot of these values can be made use of in different worldviews: a commitment to bringing about the best possible consequences will vary according to which consequences are judged as best. A commitment to cultivating care will vary according to which beings we think of as ultimately &quot;care-worthy&quot; (other humans? animals? future beings?). For both, the person-affecting/impersonal distinction is relevant in deciding in which beings we should care about and which consequences we judge to be good. Capability to suffer seems like a less volatile criterion, which is uncertain still, but I&apos;m hoping that this uncertainty is mainly empirical.</p>\n<p>Looking at different virtues, there are some which which seem to favour a presentist perspective, centering around improving oneself and caring for others in the moment, and others which might favour long-termism (e.g. if we think that humanity as a whole is acting wisely by preventing its own extinction).</p>\n<p>I have tried to show that just caring about producing good consequences or being virtuous does not give us an informative ranking of options, but that distinguishing between person-affecting and impersonal views does. I will apply this idea in the next section.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h1>Applying this</h1>\n<h3>Borda Rule</h3>\n<p>I started by ranking the options according to the Borda Rule, which Will uses in his thesis for theories that give merely ordinal choice-worthiness (that is, they give a preferred ranking, but do not provide information as to how much better or worse an option is) and where choice-worthiness is not comparable across theories.</p>\n<div>\n<table><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Option</td>\n<td><strong>person-affecting views</strong> (40% credence)</td>\n<td><strong>impersonal views</strong> (60% credence)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>(A) humans today</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>0</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>(B) animals today</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>(C) long-term future</td>\n<td>0</td>\n<td>2</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The above table gives an ordering of preferences which seems roughly plausible to me, but might vary according to whether we take &quot;person-affecting&quot; to be about humans or including animals, and how we deal with the future. For example, we might think only about persons that already exist today, or additionally consider people who would have come into existence regardless of our intervention.</p>\n<p>Multiplying the Borda score with the credence Lisa assigns to person-affecting and impersonal views, we get the following:</p>\n<p>(A): 0.4*2+0.6*0= <strong>0.8</strong></p>\n<p>(B): 0.4*1+0.6*1= <strong>1</strong></p>\n<p>(C): 0.4*0+0.6*2= <strong>1.2</strong></p>\n<p>We see that under this calculation, Option (C) - prioritizing the long-term future - scores highest. If we are very uncertain about which view is best and assign a 50% credence to each, we get:</p>\n<p>(A): 0.5*2+0.5*0= <strong>1</strong></p>\n<p>(B): 0.5*1+0.5*1= <strong>1</strong></p>\n<p>(C): 0.5*0+0.5*2= <strong>1</strong></p>\n<p>This makes it seem like, in this case, a merely ordinal ranking is still not better than just going with a simple intuition. If we add the assumption that choice-worthiness can be compared across different theories, and we think we can say something about how much more desirable one outcome is over the other, we can try our luck with cardinal ordering and see whether that is more informative.</p>\n<h3>Cardinal Ordering</h3>\n<p>For example, we might assign the following choice-worthiness to the different options under the two theories we are considering:</p>\n<div>\n<table><colgroup><col><col><col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Option</td>\n<td><strong>person-affecting views</strong> (40% credence)</td>\n<td><strong>impersonal views</strong> (60% credence)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>(A) humans today</td>\n<td>0.7</td>\n<td>0.05</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>(B) animals today</td>\n<td>0.2</td>\n<td>0.05</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>(C) long-term future</td>\n<td>0.1</td>\n<td>0.9</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Credence-weighted, we get the following results across the two views:</p>\n<p>(A) = 0.4*0.7+0.6*0.05= <strong>0.31</strong></p>\n<p>(B) = 0.4*0.2+0.6*0.05= <strong>0.11</strong></p>\n<p>(C) = 0.4*0.1+0.6*0.9= <strong>0.58</strong></p>\n<p>Where do I get these numbers from? They are based on my intuition that under person-affecting views, humans alive today are considered as more important than either animals and the long-term future, while for impersonal views, the long-term future outweighs both current human and animal welfare by a lot. I was surprised to see such a low score assigned to animal welfare, since I intuitively think that animal welfare matters a lot. What the low score reflects is my (until now implicit!) assumption that person-affecting views really only deal with persons, excluding non-human animals. It also shows that I think person-affecting views only care about persons alive today, which is a strand of person-affecting views that differs from &quot;caring only about people who would have existed anyway&quot;.</p>\n<p>If we do think that there is some merit in the intuitive cardinal ordering I provided, this ordering still gives the same result for a 50-50 credence:</p>\n<p>(A) = 0.5*0.7+0.5*0.05= <strong>0.375</strong></p>\n<p>(B) = 0.5*0.2+0.5*0.05= <strong>0.125</strong></p>\n<p>(C) = 0.5*0.1+0.5*0.9= <strong>0.5</strong></p>\n<p>Option A would only be favoured if we assign 60% credence or more to person-affecting views being right (yielding a score of 0.44 versus option C scoring 0.42). This means that if Lisa gathered evidence that made her assign a credence of 60% or more to person-affecting views, she would have to not prioritise working on the long-term future, but on helping humans alive today.</p>\n<h1>Problems</h1>\n<p>I am aware of the assigned credences seeming somewhat random, in only reflecting the subjective likelihood that someone assigns to a certain view being true. I am also unsure about whether the orderings I ascribed to different views are correct interpretations of these views. However, I hope that having ascribed numbers to different orderings might facilitate discussion later on, making assumptions more tangible and thereby easier to challenge. The extent to which we should be bothered about this problem may also depend on what we would hope to use this method for.</p>\n<p>As I mentioned above, worldviews encompass lots of different claims which are hard to disentangle. I tried to get around this by turning this into a question about person-affecting versus impersonal views, but very likely lost something along the way. This is why I hope that someone else will find this a useful prompt to propose a better way of thinking about this question.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<h5>Was this useful? /What did I learn? / What will I do as a result?</h5>\n<p>I am probably biased in favour of thinking that writing this post was useful because I invested time in doing so. Other reasons why this felt like a useful pursuit are that it was much more productive than just spending time reading on my own, since setting myself a deadline increased the amount I read and having a question in mind made my reading more focused and engaging.</p>\n<p>As for other people, I hope this might <strong>provide a model that others can use</strong> to make explicit their thinking about their priorities and their uncertainties therein. Other benefits might lie in motivating people to engage with the question at large, or in prompting someone to see flaws in what I was doing and do it better in the future.</p>\n<p>I learnt what my intuitive models of different moral theories look like and now have a much clearer grasp of where they are not as clear as I would hope them to be. I also enjoyed understanding what information might change my personal cause prioritisation. One immediate result of writing this is that I have a much better sense of which things I want to learn more about because doing so might affect my future behaviour.</p>\n<p>If you have any answers to the questions and problems raised above, or anything else you would like to add, please do leave a comment!</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Ronja_Lutz"}}, {"_id": "d8Q3tFQsjG4iiXQgs", "title": "Why founding charities is one of the highest impact things one can do", "postedAt": "2018-05-13T20:13:10.400Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><strong><span>Track record and tractability</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>Historically, some of the highest impact individuals in the EA movement and across the broader world have been people who founded effective charities. The difference between an average charity and the top charities is likely very large. Estimates for how large this difference is range from 10 to 1,000 times more impactful. But even if we look at the </span><a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/giving101/Funding-the-Right-Program\"><span>estimated difference between GiveWell&#x2019;s</span></a><span> top charities or between ACE&#x2019;s top charities, we can see the range is extremely wide. The impact of the individuals who have founded the charities at the very top (e.g. THL and AMF) have been massive. This is not even mentioning the founding of more meta-organizations like GiveWell, who has directed millions of dollars to high impact organizations.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>There is a perception that founding high impact charities is near impossible or unlikely to happen without the founders having decades of experience and specifically related credentials. However, if we look at the historical evidence it seems this perception is misguided. The following charities were founded by people with less than 4 years experience in a closely related field but had an explicit focus on doing the most good. This is not a complete list, as I do not know the history of many of the other top charities in the EA movement:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><span>GiveWell</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>AMF</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>Giving What We Can</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>80,000 Hours</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>ACE</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>Charity Science Health</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>Good Food Institute</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>Fortify Health</span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>This is a fairly impressive list, especially since a good portion of them had absolutely zero experience in the field before starting it. </span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Although track record gives us a sense of some tractability, asking whether this can be deliberately replicated is still reasonable. However, I think the evidence weighs up favourably for this as well. If we look at the most recent three charities on this list (all founded within the last 2 years), Charity Science Health has gotten two GiveWell incubation grants and has signed up over 180,000 people to their program. Good Food Institute is both ACE recommended and funded by the Open Philanthropy Project and is seen as a leader in its field. Fortify Health was founded less than 6 months ago and is now doing very well and is on track to potentially becoming a top GiveWell charity. These need to be compared to the relatively few failed direct projects founded by EAs to get a sense of what the odds are of a new charity becoming high impact. </span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Another factor to consider with tractability is the relatively high levels of support the EA movement can give to young projects. Fortify Health for example was legally housed, funded, advised and supported by Charity Science. Similarly, Charity Science Health was given lots of support from other more established charities. Very few charity founders have the strength of community that EA charity founders have which allow them to research a project before founding it or get funding before establishing themselves fully.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><strong><span>Neglectedness</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>A big reason why the founding of so many effective organizations was and still is possible is to due with how the charity market works. Sadly, it&apos;s fairly rare for a charity to be established at the start with the explicit goal of being high impact from an EA perspective. A huge number of charities are started out of personal passion or being personally affected by a cause, and although these can end up being high impact, their average effects are much lower than a nonprofit started from a research and impact-focused mindset. This inefficiency makes it much easier to start a high impact charity than an equivalently successful for-profit endeavor. Many organizations that have done research into charitable areas, such as GiveWell and Charity Science, have found non-trivial gaps, even in fairly research-focused areas like global poverty.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>It&apos;s also worth noting that it can be high impact to start multiple charities in similar areas but with somewhat different focuses or country targets. GiveWell, for example, has recommended several deworming charities. Even more dramatically, it would be easy for someone to say, &#x201C;Charity Navigator already exists. Why do we need GiveWell?&#x201D; when clearly the quality and organizational focuses are sufficiently different that founding GiveWell is likely one of the highest impact charities ever started. Furthermore, Elie and Holden might have joined Charity Navigator and tried to change them from the inside. However, that would have been a lot less efficient than them starting their own organization. From what I have seen, people find it difficult to impossible to transform an existing institution, and this is all the more acute the larger it is. Unless you can get a position near the top, starting your own organization allows you to move much more resources towards more cost-effective or evidence-based methods. This will also true in many other areas.</span>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Although EAs have been fairly aggressive on founding meta-charities, relatively few direct charities have been founded by the EA movement, despite the relatively high success levels of the direct charities that have been founded by EA-minded individuals. Aside from the ones listed above, there&#x2019;s also Evidence Action, New Incentives, The Humane League, and MIRI.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong><span>Importance</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>Founding an organization is a powerful way of getting more resources into a high impact direction. As an individual, even a very high talent one, you are limited to 40-60 hours a week of work and generally have an earning potential of under $500,000. However, both these numbers pale in comparison to general organizational scales. Even a smaller organization with say 5 staff and a one million dollar budget, greatly increases your ability to make major progress on an issue. If you hire and fundraise exclusively from EAs, you have to compare your counterfactual to the other place they would have donated/worked at, which sometimes is very high impact and other times less so. This also leads to one of the major assets of charity entrepreneurship. If you succeed in founding a charity that&#x2019;s better than the current top, you can act as a multiplier to all of the donations going to the present best by shifting them to your newly enacted intervention. If somebody starts a charity that is 1.5 times better than AMF, that will multiply future would-be donations to AMF by 50%, which at tens of millions of dollars per year is huge. However, even if you don&#x2019;t manage to oust the prevailing org of your area, often within an organization you can have your funding and jobs filled by non-EAs, which greatly alleviates counterfactual concerns.</span>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>In addition to the general force multiplier and chance at being very high impact, charities have a chance of becoming very large. The impact of even a marginally better, but very high budget, charity can be extremely large. For example, if Oxfam was 1% more cost-effectiveness focused, it could save an enormous number of additional lives. Founding charities now gives EAs the opportunity to become the next generation of very large nonprofits. Particularly with initial funding sources such as the EA movement and Open Philanthropy Project, it&#x2019;s not impossible that a charity founded by EAs could grow to be a field leader, which would have immense impact on the world.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong><span>Flow through effects</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>In addition to the case for average impact (e.g. a 10% chance of founding a GiveWell recommended charity) and a case for potentially very large hits (e.g. a 0.001% chance of founding the next Oxfam), there is a strong case that founding direct charities has strong movement building effects. It gives EA a very concrete achievement it can point at as an example of EAs doing something clearly good and high impact. Appearing more action-focused can have major benefits and help offset the perception of EAs as exclusively being focused on philosophy and theoretical concerns. This can draw more people into the EA movement, particularly people that want to see actionable, counterfactually caused accomplishments before connecting to a movement.</span>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>There is also the inspirational effect on others to start a similar organization. Evidence Action was started with deliberate reference to evidence and cost-effectiveness and they got recommended by GiveWell, which inspired us to start Charity Science Health, which in turn inspired Fortify Health. I suspect that at a certain point there will be diminishing returns on this particular aspect, but at the moment it&#x2019;s still very high. The more people who succeed the more people will see that this wasn&#x2019;t a one-off fluke, but rather something that can be repeated.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>An additional effect is if you think </span><a href=\"/ea/1ne/empirical_data_on_value_drift/\"><span>value drift is a possible risk</span></a><span>, establishing career and social capital in the charity sector is a way to increase the odds of long term altruism. If your CV is in the social sector, even if you value drift, you&#x2019;re likely to stay in the area because it&#x2019;s easier to get jobs there.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong><span>Other writing</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>See previous writing on the </span><a href=\"/ea/pi/why_charity_entrepreneurship/\"><span>value of CE</span></a><span> and the </span><a href=\"/ea/151/what_is_the_expected_value_of_creating_a_givewell/\"><span>expected value of a top charity</span></a><span> for more reasons on the impact of charity entrepreneurship.

In geographic hubs like Oxford or Berkeley there are opportunities to volunteer at an effective altruism organization in person. However, worldwide, there are now thousands of effective altruists, and their spare time is an under-utilized resource by organizations in the effective altruism ecosystem. 80,000 Hours rightly point out using your spare time to upgrade your education or learn transferable skills to further your career. However, effective altruism is a community attractive to people from all walks of life. This leaves EA with a lot of community members whose time for a variety of reasons goes unused:</p><ul><li>Students seeking to build their skills through volunteering, or want to volunteer as an effective non-profit as an extra-curricular activity.</li><li>Individuals at later stages of specialization in their careers, when acquiring new skills is less valuable at the margin than leveraging the valuable skills they already have with high-impact volunteering opportunities.</li><li>Unskilled individuals who for whatever reason don&#x27;t have the opportunities for higher education or skills-building to lead a high-impact career available to them, but are nonetheless eager to volunteer their time for a high-impact cause.</li><li>Homemakers, stay-at home parents, retirees and other supporters of effective altruism who have time to spare but aren&#x27;t seeking to (re-)enter the workplace for the foreseeable future.</li></ul><p>There are also several organizations part of the effective altruism or allied movements focused on causes common to EA which primarily focus on research, outreach and advocacy, Often these organizations depend on volunteers to keep costs low, spread awareness, raise funds, and run their projects. The\u00a0EA community actively grows through word of mouth and on the internet to a degree many organizations may not notice, and there is consistent demand for volunteer opportunities. They&#x27;re out there, but they&#x27;re not written down all in one place. I&#x27;ve surveyed organizations in and around EA for volunteer opportunities, and I&#x27;ve compiled them below. For the purposes of this master list, &quot;volunteering&quot; is broadly defined as a designated activity or task an effective altruist can take up in their spare time.\u00a0</p><h3>How to Read This List</h3><h4>For Aspiring Volunteers</h4><p>On this list are volunteer opportunities in the following focus areas across 16 different projects and organizations:</p><ul><li>Global Poverty Alleviation</li><li>Farm Animal Welfare</li><li>Wild Animal Welfare</li><li>AI Safety &amp; Existential Risk</li><li>EA Community (Movement-Building, Education &amp; Outreach)</li><li>Anti-Ageing</li></ul><p>For students and other EA community members at the beginning of their careers, all these organizations provide the opportunity to learn new skills and gain experience and contacts with EA organizations and at non-profits working on high-impact causes. For volunteers without much non-profit experience or who are looking to build their skills, several of these organizations provide the opportunity to learn and develop skills which are not only invaluable in volunteering but can be transferred to professional work on any cause. In descending order of availability, these skills include:</p><ul><li>Writing, Editing, Proof-reading and Translation</li><li>Social Media Engagement/Management</li><li>Public Speaking &amp; Presentation</li><li>Event Planning &amp; Organization</li><li>Fundraising</li><li>In-Person and Online Advocacy &amp; Activism</li><li>Information Searches &amp; Research Assistance</li><li>Project Management</li></ul><p>Several of the organizations on this list are seeking volunteers with prior experience or expertise with the following skill sets. These include:</p><ul><li>Web Design &amp; Management (WordPress, Google AdWords management, SEO optimization)</li><li>Public Speaking &amp;\u00a0Presenting</li><li>Teaching &amp; Education</li><li>Professional Editing of Research Publications/Articles</li><li>Activism &amp; Advocacy</li><li>Social Science Research</li><li>Photo &amp; Video Editing</li><li>Graphic Design</li></ul><p>Feel free to search this list using these terms, or to browse the list until you find a volunteer opportunity fitting your skills and interests.</p><h4>For Meetup/Community Organizers</h4><p>One idea for a meetup is to have an EA volunteer opportunity presentation &amp; sign-up party. Another volunteer opportunity as a meetup organizer is to run events for effective altruists or other groups to raise awareness of effective altruism and related causes. The last section of this list is &#x27;Volunteer to Organize A Local Event&#x27;, including lists resources for EA meetups, and non-profits supporting the independent organization of advocacy, outreach, and fundraising events.\u00a0</p><h4>For Organizations</h4><p>If you know of a volunteer opportunity for effective altruists not on this list, please let me know so I may add it.

Improved forecasting has been discussed many times as a <a href=\"/ea/5g/a_longrun_perspective_on_strategic_cause/\">cause area for humanity</a>&#xA0;to&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/efforts-improve-accuracy-our-judgments-and-forecasts\">make better judgements</a> and generally <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/improving-institutional-decision-making/\">improve institutional decision making.</a>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>In this post, I will argue that prediction markets are overrated within EA, both in their function for high stakes forecasting, as well as in more casual environments.</p>\n<p>A prediction market is a market created for the purpose of trading on the outcome of events. The market prices are supposed to indicate what the probability of an event is, so a contract can trade between 0 and 100%. The idea behind the merit of prediction markets is that they are markets - and therefore should be efficient.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>I. Prediction markets didn&#x2019;t do best in Tetlock&#x2019;s experiments</h3>\n<p>Prof. Tetlock lead the Good Judgement Project, a research collaborative participating in the IARPA&#x2019;s (a US intelligence org) forecasting tournament. He experimented with various setups of people participating to see which would lead to be the best outcomes. The tournament focussed on geopolitical questions with a time frame of less than a couple of years.</p>\n<p>Tetlock then wrote up his findings in Superforecasting. His book is mostly about the individual people who did consistently exceptionally well at IARPA&#x2019;s tournament, whom he calls Superforecasters and what made them special.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>But Tetlock also writes about how well his various experiments did at the tournament - among the tried methods were prediction markets. Unfortunately, while prediction markets beat the &#x2018;wisdom of crowds&#x2019; (the average of people&#x2019;s guesses) as well as most individual participants and teams of participants, they were not the experiment that did best.</p>\n<p>They were individual superforecasters who did better than prediction markets and teams of superforecasters working together did reliably better than prediction markets. Also, teams of forecasters working together often did better than prediction markets if their results were extremized - that means taking the team&#x2019;s stated probability and nudging it either closer to zero or hundred percent. The reason for extremizing to work so well is that information in teams of normal forecasters is often shared incompletely. The idea is that if all participants shared their information more completely with each other, the guesses each individual has would become more confident and thereby their average judgement more extreme. Note that extremizing works much less well if people have similar information.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>However, Tetlock grants that the experiments with prediction markets could be improved (Superforecasting, page 207):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I can already hear the protests from my colleagues in finance that the only reason the superteams beat the prediction markets was that our markets lacked liquidity: real money wasn&#x2019;t at stake and we didn&#x2019;t have a critical mass of traders. They may be right. It is a testable idea, and worth testing. It&#x2019;s also important to recognize that while superteams beat prediction markets, prediction markets did a pretty good job of forecasting complex global events.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I&#x2019;d also be curious about a prediction market in which only superforecasters trade.</p>\n<p>This brings me to the second part of my argument - namely, that the suboptimal conditions for the prediction market in the Good Judgement Project would often also apply in the real world when prediction markets get tested.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>II. Prediction markets often won&#x2019;t be efficient (as so many other markets in the real world)</h3>\n<p>It is important to recap here what market efficiency actually means: a market is efficient, if at any given time, prices fully reflect all available information about a particular stock and/or market.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The idea behind the efficiency of markets is that if there&#x2019;s information that is not yet priced in, traders have an immediate financial incentive to correct market prices which will then lead to market prices incorporating this information.</p>\n<p>This mechanism working well rests on various conditions needing to be met. In the quote above, Tetlock mentions two of them: a market having to be large and liquid.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Your small office prediction market won&#x2019;t do so well because there isn&#x2019;t enough money and not enough people trading. Correcting prices isn&#x2019;t worth the opportunity cost.&#xA0;The more money you can make in your market by correcting prices, the more likely it is the opportunity cost will be worth it. If you run a prediction market on when Mark will finish project X and you think the current estimate is hopelessly optimistic, is it really worth the cost of aggravating Mark to earn a few bucks? Of course not.</p>\n<p>The same argument applies to transaction costs - they have to be low, otherwise correcting prices isn&#x2019;t worth the cost. Your office presumably has other priorities than making sure its workers can trade easily.</p>\n<p>That said, your office prediction market will still likely do better than taking the average of the guesses of your office workers.</p>\n<p>There&#x2019;s another problem peculiar to prediction markets, which run predictions for the more distant future. If you notice a future election prediction in 2021 is only a couple of percent off, it&#x2019;s not worth it for you to invest your savings in correcting the price. You&#x2019;re better off making money on index fonds which cash out a bit more than a couple of percent over three years!</p>\n<p>But what about other bigger markets to make actually relevant prediction about the future? Surely they will be more efficient?</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;m skeptical. How stringently the conditions for market efficiency need to be met for a market to actually be efficient is an empirical question. How efficient a prediction market needs to be to give better forecasts than the alternatives is another one.</p>\n<p>For example, despite high liquidity, political prediction markets aren&#x2019;t that efficient.&#xA0; In the 2012 US presidential election, there was a big arbitrage opportunity between Intrade (a former US prediction market) and other prediction markets <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/mitt-romney-intrade-bets-trader-millions-2013-9?IR=T\">betting on the outcome of the presidential election</a>. A single trader on Intrade lost millions by continuously betting on Romney. The most likely explanation for this trader&#x2019;s behaviour was that they were trying to distort published predictions to manipulate the election outcome, since published polls and prediction markets odds tend to influence actual voter outcomes.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>From this trader&#x2019;s perspective, investing millions to increase the chance of Romney winning the election may have been a good investment, but this example shows the problems that can result when decisions are going to be made based on the prediction market&#x2019;s prices.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Even markets like political betting not being that efficient shows us how difficult it is to fulfill necessary market efficiency conditions. I&#x2019;m still optimistic for sufficiently large stock market like prediction markets in the future. But all in all, I think the merit of prediction markets is overblown.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Denise_Melchin"}}]
