And I think <strong>looking at the systems within the relevant EA orgs or leadership is what investigations or accountability questions going forward should focus on</strong> - all individuals are fallible, and we should be looking at how we can build systems in place such that the community doesn't have to just trust that people who have power and who are steering the EA movement will get it right, and that there are ways for the community to hold them accountable to their ideals or stated goals if it appears to, or risks not playing out in practice.<br><br>i.e. if there are good processes and systems in place and documentation of these processes and decisions, it's more acceptable (because other organisations that probably have a very good due diligence process also missed it). But<strong> if there weren't good processes, or if these decisions weren't a careful + intentional decision, then that's comparatively more concerning</strong>, especially in context of specific criticisms that have been raised,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8ghol0838rg\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8ghol0838rg\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; or previous precedent. For example, I'd be especially curious about the events surrounding Ben Delo,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkwg3kzaexy\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkwg3kzaexy\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and processes that were implemented in response. I'd be curious about whether there are people in EA orgs involved in steering who keep track of potential risks and early warning signs to the EA movement, <strong>in the same way the EA community advocates </strong>for in the case of pandemics, AI, or even general ways of finding opportunities for impact. For example, SBF, who <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/stories/sam-bankman-fried/\">is listed as a EtG success story on 80k hours</a>, has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SBF_FTX/status/1337250704075833347\">publicly stated </a>he's willing to go 5x over the Kelly bet, and described yield farming in a way that <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-04-25/sam-bankman-fried-described-yield-farming-and-left-matt-levine-stunned#:~:text=And%20that%20was%20so%20much%20more%20cynical%20than%20how%20I%20would%27ve%20described%20farming.%20You%27re%20just%20like%2C%20well%2C%20I%27m%20in%20the%20Ponzi%20business%20and%20it%27s%20pretty%20good.\">Matt Levine interpreted as a Ponzi</a>. Again, I'm personally less interested in the object level decision (e.g. whether or not we agree with SBF's Kelly bet comments as serious, or whether Levine's interpretation as appropriate), but more about what the process was, how this was considered at the time with the information they had etc. I'd also be curious about the documentation of any <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xafpj3on76uRDoBja/the-ftx-future-fund-team-has-resigned-1?commentId=NbevNWixq3bJMEW7b\">SBF related concerns</a> that were raised by the community, if any, and how these concerns were managed and considered (as opposed to critiquing the final outcome).<br><br>Outside of due diligence and ways to facilitate whistleblowers<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"></span></span><style>.mjx-chtml {display: inline-block;

This makes FTT kind of like stock in FTX: The higher FTX\u2019s profits are, the higher the price of FTT will be. 8  It is not actually stock in FTX \u2014 in fact FTX is a company and has stock and venture capitalists bought it, etc. \u2014 but it is a lot like stock in FTX. FTT is a bet on FTX\u2019s future profits.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But it is also a crypto token, which means that a customer can come to you and post $100 worth of FTT as collateral and borrow $50 worth of Bitcoin, or dollars, or whatever, against that collateral, just as they would with any other token. Or something; you might set the margin requirements higher or lower, letting customers borrow 25% or 50% or 95% of the value of their FTT token collateral.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you think of the token as \u201cmore or less stock,\u201d and you think of a crypto exchange as a securities broker-dealer, this is completely insane. If you go to an investment bank and say \u201clend me $1 billion, and I will post $2 billion of your stock as collateral,\u201d you are messing with very dark magic and they will say no. 9  The problem with this is that it is wrong-way risk. (It is also, at least sometimes, illegal.) If people start to worry about the investment bank\u2019s financial health, its stock will go down, which means that its collateral will be less valuable, which means that its financial health will get worse, which means that its stock will go down, etc. It is a death spiral. In general it should not be possible to bankrupt an investment bank by shorting its stock. If one of the bank\u2019s main assets is its own stock \u2014 is a leveraged bet on its own stock \u2014 then it is easy to bankrupt it by shorting its stock.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "parentCommentId": "8CDKa3T3wBL4vgkdC", "user": {"username": "cole_haus"}}, {"_id": "aCPL2dunSXwERXycr", "postedAt": "2022-11-13T19:04:46.502Z", "postId": "HyHCkK3aDsfY95MoD", "htmlBody": "<p>I think the above points hold. No question that FTX transfering funds to Alameda is the crux of the moral &nbsp;issue at play here. But financially speaking, and to flush out the liquidity issue... for such significant holdings of FTT, those funds should have only been considered with a massive haircut, maybe even upwards of 90%. Alameda said they had billions worth of FTT (in USD terms), and sure that was the case at market prices prior to all of this this. But as we know from what precipatated everything, sell pressure in that range (as was about to happen from Binance), absolutely nuked the market's confidence and therefore value in &nbsp;FTT. So how much more so would this have been the case if FTX/Alameda ever had came along and said they needed to liquidate billions in FTT?</p><p>There was never going to be a way out.
