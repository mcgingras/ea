This is helpful for assessing whether the average is actually a good summary of the data (not to actually figure out the distribution in and of itself). In this case, it shows that the distribution of community satisfaction for Black or African American people in the EA community looks a bit unusual, with more observations on the lower and higher end. However, the total sample size for this category is only 34. This is quite low so I wouldn't be surprised if the distribution will end up looking differently if the sample size was greater.</p>", "parentCommentId": "sMump6pKLPgCDupr6", "user": {"username": "WillemSleegers"}}]
