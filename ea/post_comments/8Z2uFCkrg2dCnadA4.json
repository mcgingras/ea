Major props to you and the LIC team for stepping up and taking the fight directly to the big guys like Case Farms. It's really inspiring to see you using the legal system as a tool to protect animals.

I think we sometimes lose sight of the actual suffering behind the numbers and strategies we discuss on the EA Forum. So, I strongly recommend everyone here to take a few minutes to watch this video to remind ourselves of what suffering looks like on the ground.</p><p>For those who can't or choose not to watch it, here's a brief description of what it reveals:<br>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Newly-hatched chicks killed, mangled, maimed or trapped in equipment or machinery that was improperly operated or set up.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Some chicks were not mangled by machines but were deformed, hatched improperly, hatched early and died, etc.</li><li>Chicks being roughly handled, thrown, having plastic trays dragged across them and crushing their throats, and driven over with machinery.</li><li>Injured or deformed chicks in trays with dead ones left to languish for hours.&nbsp;</li><li>Gassing sick or injured birds before dumping them into a macerator to be sliced and rendered; in some instances, dumping fully conscious chicks into the macerator to be ground alive.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Alene, your work is reminding us of the urgency and significance of this cause. Please continue to keep us posted on your progress and victories.</p><p>Keep fighting the good fight!</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Constance Li"}}, {"_id": "QyRu5Af78aTPjBaDk", "postedAt": "2023-05-28T17:39:38.066Z", "postId": "8Z2uFCkrg2dCnadA4", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you so much Constance!</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "HDwuQe3HaK2yF5Bpm", "user": {"username": "alene"}}, {"_id": "gpiDyAANcceaDoaLN", "postedAt": "2023-05-28T17:40:02.039Z", "postId": "8Z2uFCkrg2dCnadA4", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you Fai!!!!</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "hGDh9iY42E9RBJFcF", "user": {"username": "alene"}}, {"_id": "nA2EgDSyz2XPwivHb", "postedAt": "2023-06-29T12:42:01.482Z", "postId": "8Z2uFCkrg2dCnadA4", "htmlBody": "<p>Oh no!
