Monte Carlo simulations are used.</li><li>Examples suggest research can often compare favorably to direct funding even with limited years of influence.</li><li>Shifting funders from low to moderate cost-effectiveness can be highly cost-effective.</li><li>Limitations include estimating influence, transition costs, alternate uses of money, declining returns, and uncertainty.</li><li>The model currently uses an expected value framework and doesn't account for risk aversion or moral uncertainty.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>This comment was auto-generated by the EA Forum Team.
