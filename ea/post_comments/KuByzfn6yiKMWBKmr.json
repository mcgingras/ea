At the same time, I feel like Rethink Priorities' moral weight <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/y5n47MfgrKvTLE3pw\">project</a> (funded by Open Phil) makes use of the best available empirical evidence (greatly illustrated <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/y5n47MfgrKvTLE3pw/p/tnSg6o7crcHFLc395\">here</a>), and it <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Qk3hd6PrFManj8K6o/rethink-priorities-welfare-range-estimates\">found</a> a median welfare range for chickens of 0.332 (i.e. having a chicken for 1 year in its best possible state, instead of its worst possible state, is 0.332 times as good as having a human for 1 year in its best possible state, instead of her/his worst possible state). This implies, under hedonism, that corporate campaigns for chicken welfare are way more cost-effective that GiveWell's top charities (in my mind, unsurprinsingly given Luke's guess, but really important to have an in-depth investigation like Rethink's to have a better sense of the difference).</p><blockquote><p>A moral parliaments view given uncertainty can lead to a lot of GiveWell looking much better.

For instance, I don't know how a Kantian would weigh wild animal welfare or even shrimp welfare (would neuron weights express a being willing something?).</p></blockquote><p>This is a bit of a tangent, but Korsgaard discusses wild animals a bit in <i>Fellow creatures</i>. Some excerpts follow ...</p><p>Korsgaard says work on animal ethics produces an \"antinomy\", where the same premise seemingly yields two opposite conclusions (\"creation ethics\" \u2013 we should do lots to reduce animal suffering \u2013 and \"abolitionism\" \u2013 we should do nothing except stay away):</p><blockquote><p>The natural world staunchly resists moral reorganization. As a result, we are unable to treat all animals in the way that morality demands, that is, as ends in themselves who have a claim to be treated in a way that is consistent with their good. Many people try to deal with the resulting problems by telling themselves that animals are so dimwitted that they cannot really suffer very much, or so unimportant that their suffering does not matter. The friends of animals, knowing that these things are not true, think that we have to try to reorganize the population of the natural world, so that all animals are either domestic and under our protection [\"creation ethicists\"], or wild animals with whom we do not interact at all [\"abolitionists\"].</p><p>[...] Morality teaches us how to construct a world that is, to a large extent anyway, good for all of us, governed by standards to which all of us can agree. But we cannot extend these benefits to all of the animals, in part because the system of predator and prey, and the competition for natural resources, sets them inevitably against each other.</p></blockquote><p>She also brings up invertebrate suffering as another problem for either of these views:</p><blockquote><p>Another problem is size. It is pretty hard to avoid harming things that are not somewhere in the same general size range as you are. But the world is teeming with organisms, most of them tiny by our standards. Some of these creatures may, for all we know, be sentient.</p></blockquote><p>She says we can resolve the antinomy by distinguishing between what we ought to do and what we can do, and advocates what she calls a \"preservation ethics\":</p><blockquote><p>Rather than trying to create new and more morally tractable species of animals, I think we should do what we can to interact with the existing animals and the ongoing animal communities that already exist, in a way that respects the absolute value of their good.</p><p>Abolitionists, like creationists, want to change the nature of animals in a way that they think would make it easier for us to treat them well, or rather, to stop mistreating them. [...] But in one way their position is stronger than that of the creationists. I argued before that although one world cannot be better than another if they have different inhabitants, the creator of a world has a duty to make things as good as possible for whoever she creates. As I have tried to emphasize, part of the problem with creation ethics is that it invites us to <i>take up</i> the position of the creator with respect to wild animals, and it is not clear why we should do that, or if we would have the right to even if we could. But we are <i>already</i> in the position of the creator towards domestic animals, so the claim that we might have a duty to stop creating them is more plausible.</p></blockquote><p>In practice, what Korsgaard recommends may not be that different from <i>current</i> EA wild animal welfare work, which I would guess Korsgaard would mostly endorse. But my sense is that EAs may support stronger interventions \u2013 even where humans are not involved in creating harms \u2013 in theory at least, and not pursue those right now simply because they are too uncertain/intractable, a thing that could change in the future.</p><p>Of course it's possible that Korsgaard's view is involves status quo bias. You could say that any interaction with animals &nbsp;\u2013 and even a decision <i>not</i> to assume the role of creator \u2013 does involve acting as creator of sorts, such that you are inevitably in that position.</p>", "parentCommentId": "t9GFRPk6YEkCmcRAA", "user": {"username": "Erich_Grunewald"}}, {"_id": "sCFdYspYneHp5Akao", "postedAt": "2023-10-08T23:15:30.827Z", "postId": "KuByzfn6yiKMWBKmr", "htmlBody": "<p>Good point, and I'll throw out The Humane League as one specific recipient of money.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Farmed animal welfare is politically controversial in a way that GiveWell is not.

I agree this has to be accounted for but trust OpenPhil, ACE, and e.g. The Humane League to account for this when deciding what to do and who to fund. Empirically, it seems to be the case that e.g. cage free advocacy has worked and laws like California's prop 12 have passed and been upheld.</p><blockquote><p>It's hard to be as confident in political interventions - humans and groups of humans are much less predictable than e.g. malaria</p></blockquote><p>First, at one level I agree but then would point to all the non-political animal welfare interventions like cage free advocacy without bans and Shrimp Welfare Project paying for farms to install stunners. At another I just disagree that e.g. AMF has high-confidence certain impact on the world. All the analyses explicitly don't even try to account for 3rd+ order effects (not sure about 2nd) which is plausibly where a ton of impact lies.</p><blockquote><p>- Farmed animal welfare sometimes seems overly-connected with dubious left-wing politics (e.g. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/5iCsbrSqLyrfP55ry/concerns-with-ace-s-recent-behavior-1)\">https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/5iCsbrSqLyrfP55ry/concerns-with-ace-s-recent-behavior-1)</a></p></blockquote><p>I've definitely seen first hand how much of especially veganism/vegan advocacy per se is very lefty and, more importantly, less clear eyed and epistemically rigorous than EA in general and certainly meta level EA orgs.
