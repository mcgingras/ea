However I don't think the evidence supports your narrow definition of the term 'social justice warrior'. I understand that some people define it this way, but it's use is definitely not limited to that narrow conception.\nFor example see the entry on wikipedia under 'social justice':</p>\n<p>&quot;The term &quot;social justice warrior&quot; has been used to describe people who work for social justice issues, often &quot;claiming a moral authority&quot; and &quot;questioning the motives and moral integrity of those they oppose&quot;. People given as examples of social justice warriors include Mahatma Gandhi and Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr..[43] In internet culture, the term has been used as a pejorative for someone advocating for social justice issues such as racism, sexism, or homophobia. Frequently initialized as &quot;SJW&quot;, it is used to accuse ideological opponents of sanctimony,[44] to insinuate pretense,[45][46] and as a general purpose negative.[47][48][49] Although most commonly used to cast negative implications, some have reappropriated the term as a neutral or positive source of identity.[50][51]</p>\n<p>Likewise, if you look at urban dictionary, the definition is strongly contested. The analogy to the phase 'politically correct' holds quite strong: its proponents might narrowly define it in to something most people would agree with (eg the reframing of language to avoid offence which ends up with people using unintelligible and unwieldy terms merely to demonstrate their credibility), but it's use is frequently pejorative and used to shut down criticism ('hey, it's just a joke, don't be so politically correct')</p>\n<p>I'd be happy to assume someone coming across the phrase for the first time might not be familiar with the way the term is actually used, but Dale implies that he is familiar with social justice dialogue, which is why I think it's fair to point out the problematic and exclusionary implications of it here. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "d9tLdBubpdgr8LLbt", "user": {"username": "Bernadette_Young"}}, {"_id": "ohwtJcoPppXbTyQLn", "postedAt": "2015-01-16T20:18:31.073Z", "postId": "DYr7kBpMpmbygBiEq", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>I understand that some people define it this way, but it's use is definitely not limited to that narrow conception.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yep, different people can use the same term in different ways.  In this case, a charitable reading might take the focus off of the ambiguous term &quot;social justice warrior&quot; and look for other clues as to what Dale is trying to communicate: Dale refers to people who &quot;give you a lot of flak for your race, gender, career success&quot;, are &quot;hostile&quot;, and participate in &quot;tweetstorms of hate&quot;.

Jeff presented an argument. You responded, saying something which sounded close to &quot;I understand why you've written this post, but you can do better.&quot; While this is supportive at a surface level, it also sounds like perhaps Jeff doesn't really understand why he wrote the post, and if he did understand, maybe he wouldn't agree with it. That was the chain which led me to say it looked like an ad hominem (I'm not sure whether the term exactly fits, but I don't know a better one).</p>\n<p>Note that none of these negative things were implied by what you said -- it was all <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Implicature\">implicature</a>. Because you wrote a reasonably long response which gave an alternative explanation for Jeff's post while not engaging with the object-level content, a salient explanation was that you disagreed with the argument and were trying to put it down. I think if you'd cancelled the implicature by adding a statement like &quot;I agree with the argument&quot; or &quot;I'm sure this isn't the only reason you've written this&quot; then you would have got rather less negative responses.</p>\n<p>Sorry again for the confusion that comes in these online discussions.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "29FsHtC4gd7pwEyWR", "user": {"username": "Owen_Cotton-Barratt"}}, {"_id": "HAknPg8HWytDr9tNc", "postedAt": "2015-01-18T21:47:55.326Z", "postId": "DYr7kBpMpmbygBiEq", "htmlBody": "<p>Nice anti-apology, Owen. Since you are super-intelligent, you know the meaning of what people say even when they don't know themselves, right? You still maintain that Dale implicated Jeff did something wrong. If that were the case then whenever anyone says to his friend, \u201cDon't let the haters you drag you to their level.\u201d or \u201cHe ain't worth it.\u201d he is in fact insulting his friend by implicating he has done something wrong. The response I see to this advice is usually \u201cThanks, man. You're a good friend.\u201d Are all these people too stupid to know they are being insulted? Instead, the proper response to this common supportive advice should be \u201cStop insulting me by insinuating I did something wrong.\u201d then?</p>\n<p>You state that because Dale wrote a possible explanation for Jeff's post without engaging the explicit statements Jeff made, he is showing his disapproval for Jeff's post. That is not logical. If Dale wanted to make a point, he would have made it. Don't put words in his mouth. If you told you're girlfriend you wanted to eat and she said, \u201cDon't let yourself to hungry, now.\u201d by your logic she is implicating that you did something wrong by allowing yourself to become hungry. Or if I told my friend, \u201cI really want to go out tonight.\u201d and he said, \u201cI hear you. Not good to stay in all the time.\u201d, he is implicating that I am doing something wrong by staying home too much? In both these example, as in Dale's reply to Jeff, they are being sympathetic, not disapproving in any way. Don't pass off your lack of understanding people as ignorance in someone else. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "7a5zQW4Ch9drBPQhu", "user": {"username": "Austen_Forrester"}}, {"_id": "daZFebomn4C6HByvD", "postedAt": "2015-01-19T08:55:10.036Z", "postId": "DYr7kBpMpmbygBiEq", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Austen,</p>\n<p>I was trying to draw a distinction between what Dale meant when writing it (which I don't claim any problem with), and what people reading it might think was meant.

You give one definition of the phrase that might be perfectly defensible, but the way it is actually used (in general, not only in your post) smuggles in extra meaning which can be dismissive or silencing. You may not intend that other meaning at all, but it's out there in common use, so we don't get to just ignore it.</p>\n<p>That extra meaning is smuggled in very easily. For example, in your own comment, you include a sentence which implies (as I understand it) that people on the internet are not genuine when they comment on issues of equality if they don't 'spend all their time campaigning about Rotherham or ISIS'. That strikes me as massively unfair. Like you, I work long hours earning to give and support SCI, partly because I think the best way to help marginalised groups is to fight poverty. (I do actually think we're on the same side). But I don't think that means I have to give up the right to express an opinion about how gender affects me systematically, or that I'm let off the hook for understanding how inequality affects other people in the world I inhabit. The term privilege is useful in such conversations, as Jeff has eloquently explained here.</p>\n<p>And yes, I do so on the internet (where lots of conversation happens), and I may be conversing with (or even criticise) a white man (since I know lots). It really isn't taking a leap to feel that your term and broad dismissal apply to me, even when you didn't intend it that way. </p>\n<p>Finally I am sorry, because I get the feeling you feel a bit piled on after writing a comment that was intended to support an ally. I can understand that, and I'm sorry for contributing to that feeling. I think we share the goal of this being a supportive community. To that end I hope I've been able to explain why other people who are part of this community might reasonably be alienated by the way you expressed your support. If I've failed, then I guess it's best to leave the conversation here. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "Zp9Zs8pYtFKGT7A7B", "user": {"username": "Bernadette_Young"}}, {"_id": "8NkdpoRofMSuiDTRA", "postedAt": "2015-01-30T09:28:55.560Z", "postId": "DYr7kBpMpmbygBiEq", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Jeff.</p>\n<p>You say that &quot;the best response to privilege is to turn it to fixing the situation that led you to having these major advantages over others&quot;.
