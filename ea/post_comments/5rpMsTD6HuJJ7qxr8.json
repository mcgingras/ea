Destiny has a similar Light vs. Darkness dichotomy.</li><li>Carlsmith discusses the challenge of instilling \"yin\" (gentleness, acceptance) in AI systems, which tend towards \"yang\" (imposing values, self-preservation, resource acquisition).</li><li>The antagonists of Destiny are tragic figures, given destructive power without the wisdom to wield it responsibly. The biggest \"Other\" in Imajica is Hapexamendios himself.</li><li>The post questions what it would take to accept an entity's offer to \"wipe the slate clean\" and start the world anew, as Hapexamendios proposes.</li><li>Coordination and competition are not necessarily opposites. Some competition keeps cooperation robust against defection. The Goddesses and Destiny's Light recognize the need for balance.</li><li>Yang is presented as dangerous in these works, but it also enables flourishing and justice. The true danger is in worshipping yang to the exclusion of yin.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>This comment was auto-generated by the EA Forum Team.
