A key principle is&nbsp;<i>impartiality</i>: suffering matters equally irrespective of&nbsp;<i>who</i> experiences it. In particular, I believe we should care about all sentient beings, including nonhuman animals. Similarly, I believe suffering matters equally regardless of&nbsp;<i>when</i> it is experienced. A future individual is no less (and no more) deserving of moral consideration than someone alive now. So the fact that a moral catastrophe takes place in the distant future does not reduce the urgency of preventing it, if we have the means to do so. I will assume that you broadly agree with these fundamental values, which form the starting point of the book.</p></blockquote><p>That is, I'm not dwelling on an argument for these fundamental values, as that can be found elsewhere.</p>", "parentCommentId": "Cfo27kJ6J46NSMFWJ", "user": {"username": "Tobias_Baumann"}}, {"_id": "WbQozRys5PrHcFRCa", "postedAt": "2022-10-27T10:13:09.251Z", "postId": "XyCLLYkBCPw44jpmQ", "htmlBody": "<p>The easiest way to download it as an epub is <a href=\"https://www.smashwords.com/books/view/1174866\">here</a>.</p>", "parentCommentId": "6djqR6uHCnksqRYot", "user": {"username": "Tobias_Baumann"}}, {"_id": "rhcmGokCfaWRdLBqv", "postedAt": "2022-10-27T10:18:22.360Z", "postId": "XyCLLYkBCPw44jpmQ", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks!&nbsp;</p><p>An audiobook is a good idea and I'll look into it, though I don't expect it to be done any time soon (i.e. it would at least take several months, I think).</p>", "parentCommentId": "ezetJKCHF7uLBF5Zp", "user": {"username": "Tobias_Baumann"}}, {"_id": "nNjQLZDoRFhuCxpBa", "postedAt": "2022-10-27T11:50:07.994Z", "postId": "XyCLLYkBCPw44jpmQ", "htmlBody": "<p>You might consider creating a text-to-speech version by using e.g. Amazon Polly.
