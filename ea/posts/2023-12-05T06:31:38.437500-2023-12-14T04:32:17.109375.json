We believe this transition will allow us to better serve our community and to achieve our mission more effectively. Below, you'll find all the details you need, including what is changing, what isn't, and how you can get involved.</p><h2>A heartfelt thanks</h2><p>First and foremost, we owe a very big thank you to the team at EV. Their support over the years has helped us to grow and have a meaningful impact in the world. We could not be more grateful for their support.</p><p>A big thank you also to our members and donors who have supported us along the way. In particular I\u2019d like to thank the many of you who we\u2019ve consulted throughout the process of arriving at this decision and working on a plan.</p><h2>Why spin out?</h2><p>When&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/history\"><u>GWWC was founded in 2009</u></a>, it was among the first in a small constellation of initiatives aimed at fostering&nbsp;<a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/5w/the_history_of_the_term_effective_altruism/\"><u>what would soon be called \u201ceffective altruism.\u201d</u></a> In 2011, following the establishment of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/\"><u>80,000 Hours</u></a>, both organisations came together to form the Centre for Effective Altruism (which is now EV&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xaMLvzbaBMFjX88Z2/cea-disambiguation\"><u>to disambiguate</u></a> from the project called Centre for Effective Altruism, which is also housed within EV).</p><p>A lot has changed in the intervening years, both within GWWC and within EV. Today, EV is home to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ev.org/organisations/\"><u>more than 10 different initiatives</u></a> and is focused on a broad range of issues. As for GWWC, we have developed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://givingwhatwecan.org/strategy\"><u>ambitious plans for our future</u></a> and are committed to focusing more than ever on our core mission: to make effective and significant giving a cultural norm.</p><p>We\u2019ve been considering this option for quite some time and have come to the conclusion that the best way to achieve our mission is to be an independent organisation. Being independent will allow us to:</p><ul><li>Align our organisational structure and governance more closely with our mission.</li><li>Better manage our own legal and reputational risks.</li><li>Have greater clarity and transparency of our inner workings and governance to the outside world.</li><li>Have greater control over our operational costs.</li></ul><p>We believe that these changes will enable us to serve our community better and to contribute more effectively to growing effective giving.</p><h2>The details</h2><p>For most of you, very little will change. There will be a multi-stage transition period (most of which we estimate will be completed over the next 12 months) and any relevant changes will be communicated in a timely and transparent manner. Here\u2019s what to expect:</p><h3>What's changing</h3><ul><li>We have registered Giving What We Can USA Inc. as a 501(c)(3) charity in the US, and have started the process of registering charities in the UK and Canada. There will be a transfer of GWWC-specific intellectual property, contracts, services, and data (e.g. brand, databases, website, files) to the new entities (exact structure to be determined) and a transition of the donation platform across to the new entities. Our supported programs (e.g. charitable projects and grantmaking funds) will need to be onboarded as programs with our new entities before any switch over dates (TBC) in each country.</li><li>We are recruiting new governance and advisory boards for the new entities.</li><li>We're also pursuing affiliate arrangements to continue to expand effective-giving support into new countries (e.g. our collaboration with EA Australia to launch GWWC Australia). This will include adapting our approach to local tax situations, cultural contexts, languages, and currencies.</li></ul><h3>What's not changing</h3><ul><li>Our dedication to fostering a culture of effective and meaningful giving continues unabated, guided by our long-standing mission.</li><li>Our community of members who have taken our pledge will continue to grow and be supported throughout the transition period and beyond.</li><li>Our trusted donation platform will continue being maintained and improved, serving as a gateway to impactful philanthropy.</li><li>Our research and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/inclusion-criteria\"><u>inclusion criteria</u></a> will continue iterating and improving, as we strive to be a robust and compelling resource for giving effectively.</li><li>We will continue to support fundraising for and grantmaking to our range of supported programs (both within and outside of EV).</li></ul><h2>How you can help</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/careers/governance-advisory-boards\"><strong><u>Apply to our governance or advisory boards</u></strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://airtable.com/appYQIIq3t2Hrq16O/shrlkkCwtiEr9fGKj\"><strong><u>Offer to help with board recruitment</u></strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/a8wijyw45SjwmeLY6/gwwc-is-funding-constrained-and-prefers-broad-base-support\"><strong><u>Support operational funding</u></strong></a> (currently offering a 1:1 match)<ul><li>For donors looking to donate greater than $10,000 we would appreciate funding being directed to our new entities, please contact us if you would like to provide this support.</li></ul></li></ul><p>This is an exceptionally important time for us and your support is greatly appreciated.</p><h2>Have more questions?</h2><p>Please feel free to email&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:luke.freeman@givingwhatwecan.org\"><u>luke.freeman@givingwhatwecan.org</u></a> with any questions you have.</p><hr><p><i><strong>Note:</strong> EV has also been reconsidering their future organisational plans and have posted an update about it </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/HjsfHwqasyQMWRzZN/ev-updates-ftx-settlement-and-the-future-of-ev#Future_of_EV\"><i>here</i></a><i>.</i></p>", "user": {"username": "Luke Freeman"}}, {"_id": "HjsfHwqasyQMWRzZN", "title": "EV updates: FTX settlement and the future of EV", "postedAt": "2023-12-13T21:25:17.241Z", "htmlBody": "<p>We\u2019re announcing two updates today that we believe will strengthen the effective altruism ecosystem.</p><h2>FTX updates&nbsp;</h2><p>First, we\u2019re pleased to say that both Effective Ventures UK and Effective Ventures US have agreed to settlements with the FTX bankruptcy estate. As part of these settlements, EV US and EV UK (which I\u2019ll collectively refer to as \u201cEV\u201d) have between them paid the estate $26,786,503, an amount equal to 100% of the funds the entities received from FTX and the FTX Foundation (which I\u2019ll collectively refer to as \u201cFTX\u201d) in 2022. All of this money was either originally received from FTX or allocated to pay the settlement with the knowledge and support of their original donor. This means that EV\u2019s projects can continue to fundraise with confidence that donations won\u2019t be used to cover the cost of this settlement. We strongly condemn fraud and the actions underlying Sam Bankman-Fried\u2019s conviction.</p><p>Also related to FTX, in September we completed an independent investigation about the relationship between FTX and EV. The investigation, commissioned from the law firm Mintz, included dozens of interviews as well as reviews of tens of thousands of messages and documents. Mintz found no evidence that anyone at EV (including employees, leaders of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ev.org/organisations/\"><u>EV-sponsored projects</u></a>, and trustees) was aware of the criminal fraud of which Sam Bankman-Fried has now been convicted.</p><p>While we are not publishing any additional details regarding the investigation because doing so could reveal information from people who have not consented to their confidences being publicized and could waive important legal privileges that we do not intend to waive, we recognize that knowledge of criminal activity isn\u2019t the only concern. I plan to share other non-privileged information on lessons learned in the aftermath of FTX and encourage others to share their reflections as well.&nbsp;</p><p>EV also started working on structural improvements shortly after FTX\u2019s collapse and continued to do so alongside the investigation. Over the past year, we have implemented structural governance and oversight improvements, including restructuring the way the two EV charities work together, updating and improving key corporate policies and procedures at both charities, increasing the rigor of donor due diligence, and staffing up the in-house legal departments. Nevertheless, good governance and oversight is not a goal that can ever be definitively \u2018completed\u2019, and we\u2019ll continue to iterate and improve. We plan to open source those improvements where feasible so the whole EA ecosystem can learn from EV\u2019s challenges and benefit from the work we\u2019ve done.&nbsp;</p><p>We\u2019re pleased to have reached this point and to bring our financial interactions with the FTX bankruptcy to a close. We expect the settlements will permanently resolve matters between EV US + EV UK and the FTX estate, enabling EV, our teams, and our projects to move forward.</p><h2>Future of EV</h2><p>Which brings me to our second announcement: Now that we consider matters with the FTX estate to be resolved, we are planning to take significant steps to decentralize the effective altruism ecosystem by offboarding the projects which currently sit under the Effective Ventures umbrella. This means CEA, 80,000 Hours, Giving What We Can and other&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ev.org/organisations/\"><u>EV-sponsored projects</u></a> will transition to being independent legal entities, with their own leadership, operational staff, and governance structures. We anticipate the details of the offboarding process will vary by project, and we expect the overall process to take some time \u2013 likely 1-2 years until all projects have finished.</p><p>EV served an important purpose in allowing these projects to launch with lower friction, but the events of last year also made the costs of centralization and EV\u2019s structure much more salient. Many of our projects are now well established and will benefit from independent structures designed with their specific needs in mind, though I also suspect that there will be some friction as they establish their new operating models. Despite the potential costs, we are convinced this push towards decentralization will make the EA ecosystem more resilient and better enable our projects to pursue their own goals. We\u2019ve learned a lot through the mistakes and success that occurred while building EV and we plan to share additional reflections when they are ready.<br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Zachary Robinson"}}, {"_id": "NCyREfqDbar8PJKdu", "title": "Vaccine delivery: Timelines and drivers of delay in low- and middle-income countries", "postedAt": "2023-12-13T20:12:30.793Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>Suggested citation: </strong>Gosnell, G., Braid, E., &amp; Basnak, M. 2023. Vaccine delivery: Timelines and drivers of delay in low- and middle-income countries. Rethink Priorities. <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/vaccine-delivery\">[https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/vaccine-delivery]</a></p><p><strong>Funding statement</strong>: We thank Open Philanthropy for commissioning and funding this research report. The views expressed herein are not necessarily endorsed by Open Philanthropy.</p><h1>Editorial note</h1><p>This report was produced by Rethink Priorities during February and March 2023. The project was commissioned and supported by Open Philanthropy, which does not necessarily endorse our conclusions. For this report, we investigated the global rollout of six classes of vaccines across the past 70 years, with a special focus on any delays between a vaccine\u2019s initial availability in high-income countries and its widespread availability in low- and middle-income countries. For each vaccine, we have described the rollout process, highlighted key factors contributing to delays, and created timelines of certain milestones to enable comparisons across vaccines. See below for more about our research approach. We have tried to flag major sources of uncertainty in the report, and are open to revising our views based on new information or further research.</p><h1>Executive summary</h1><p>Universal introduction of vaccines in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) has tended to lag behind introductions in high-income countries (HICs). While affordability appears to have been a large source of delay in some cases, the establishment of Gavi appears to have largely alleviated this bottleneck for countries eligible to receive support. <a href=\"https://perma.cc/QMF7-TFSX\">Gavi</a> is a global public-private partnership that supports vaccine delivery in LMICs through a variety of initiatives. Gavi support for financing vaccine supplies, developing combination vaccines, and/or coordinating vaccine delivery campaigns appears to have been instrumental in catalyzing the national introduction of vaccines for each of several diseases we consider, including polio, measles, Hib disease, rotavirus, pneumococcal disease, typhoid, and human papilloma virus (HPV). While scrutinizing specific Gavi programs and approaches was outside the scope of this report, the experts we consulted generally agreed that the affordability of vaccines should no longer be a significant barrier to their introduction in LMICs.</p><p>While delays between vaccine introduction milestones appear to be shrinking with time, there remain opportunities for improving efficiency and experiences throughout the process. Possible interventions suggested by our research include:</p><ul><li>Improving (accessibility of) evidence on disease burden in LMICs</li><li>Generating robust clinical evidence of effectiveness in LMICs concurrently with evidence generation in HICs</li><li>Designing vaccines to improve uptake and compliance in LMICs (e.g., more multivalent vaccines)</li><li>Improving demand forecasting and implementing market shaping interventions (e.g., long-term or future procurement arrangements, stakeholder coordination, and development of vaccine criteria for manufacturers) to ensure sufficient supply</li><li>Building capacity in LMICs (e.g., adaptability to administer to different age groups)</li></ul><p>Experts in vaccine delivery confirmed that the above interventions are worthy of attention, and each expert highlighted the importance of context. In other words, not all solutions will work nor bottlenecks exist for each vaccine or each country, and unique solutions and bottlenecks will arise in different contexts. Several experts therefore encouraged increased involvement of national and subnational/local-level stakeholders to increase understanding of context-specific opportunities (e.g., integration with existing programs and priorities) and constraints (e.g., vaccine culture or crowded vaccine schedules) and improve accountability. Experts also emphasized the need to develop more opportunities for stakeholder learning, particularly for countries to learn from each other and from their own domestic non-health sectors.</p><h1>Research approach</h1><p>This research aims to understand whether and at which point(s) there are time gaps between milestones in the process from vaccine development to vaccine delivery in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We classify countries as LMICs if they are, or eventually become, eligible for Gavi support.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdmauolvrx2\"><sup><a href=\"#fndmauolvrx2\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Similarly, \u201chigh-income countries\u201d (HICs) are those that do not eventually become eligible for Gavi support.</p><p>The approach we take is to identify the years in which particular milestones were reached for eight vaccines for which <a href=\"https://view-hub.org/vaccine\">VIEW-hub</a> contains data (we exclude Covid-19 vaccines). Open Philanthropy identified the milestones on which we primarily focus:</p><ul><li>Initiation date of first Phase 3 trial</li><li>Date of interim data release from Ph3</li><li>Date of final publication of Ph3</li><li>Date of first approval in a HIC (or by EMA)</li><li>Date of 3rd approval in HIC (or by EMA)</li><li>Date of first WHO prequalification</li><li>Date of first Gavi-eligible country introduction</li><li>Date of Gavi support (if relevant)</li><li>Date of &gt;10M sales in LMICs</li><li>Date of 10th Gavi-eligible country introduction</li></ul><p>Note: The early history of the polio, measles, and Hib vaccines dates back to the 1950s-1980s, so some of the information we identified may be less accurate given the more limited data and resources (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov was not established until 2000, and UNICEF procurement data generally does not precede 1996). Therefore, the precise year of the first Phase 3 clinical trials and their publication, as well as the year when sales thresholds were met, is based on our best guess.</p><p>We created <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18S0pBot9xUEng_RYxQ99Ela5I5wdHC1FO5IAhk0WzWM/edit\">a spreadsheet</a> to visualize and compare these timelines, which largely overlap with the written timelines in the following sections of this draft. In many cases, we came across additional milestones that we felt were worth noting, or there were several vaccines for a particular disease and including all information in the written timeline would have made them difficult to follow, so there may be minor discrepancies across the written and visual timelines. For each vaccine, we include what we perceive to be the top causes of delays to LMIC introduction, the written timeline, and a narrative storyline that provides more detail.</p><p>To better inform and provide context around our desk research, we conducted interviews with experts within some of the major organizational players involved in vaccine delivery to LMICs. Specifically, we spoke with International Vaccine Access Center (IVAC), Farzana Muhib and Bill Hausdorff at PATH, Lora Shimp at John Snow, Inc. (JSI), and another expert who is not named in this report.</p><p><img style=\"width:713.525px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/hlzmenkzpp9wlfrmdxl5\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/kjxrg9pgvbmkbm85wvaj 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/ngsrw3pkqul5mp7exjto 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/hhenbppxpatorubxclek 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/dg5jglstgwcjgovqapwp 750w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/j35vsilh7znkynx2hudy 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/fqzo8perrc9znymjvss7 1500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/u6iugrgh2mnodxce02hx 2500w\"></p><h1>Acknowledgments</h1><p>Greer Gosnell and Erin Braid were the main authors of this report.

We\u2019ll cover topics including political advocacy, youth advocacy, global advocacy, equity and inclusion, consumer behavior, and capacity building. In 2024, we plan to hire a Projects Manager to help our team continue to be as efficient as possible as we bring more and more research to the animal protection community.</p><p><a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/research-in-progress/\"><strong>In-Progress Studies Coming Soon</strong></a></p><ul><li><strong>Collaborative Opportunities with Environmental Organizations:</strong> We\u2019re working to identify environmentalists\u2019 perspectives on potential opportunities for, and challenges of, collaborating with animal advocates.</li><li><strong>Benchmarking Compensation in the Farmed Animal Protection Movement</strong>: Salary transparency and benchmarking are important tools for a fair and equitable movement, and this study will provide insights to support advocates and organizations alike.</li><li><strong>The Impact of Humanewashing on Consumer Behavior</strong>: Our simulated shopping experiment will shed light on whether humanewashing helps consumers justify their consumption of animal products.</li><li><strong>Conservative Political Values with Respect to Animal Advocacy</strong>: We\u2019re investigating ways that U.S. animal advocates can potentially leverage conservative political values to make headway for animals.</li><li><strong>International Advocacy Strategies and Needs: </strong>We\u2019re uncovering the reasons why animal protection groups in different regions and circumstances choose particular approaches to advocacy, and what resources they would need in order to expand their efforts.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Chicken and Fish Substitution Meta-Analysis: </strong>Are consumers giving up one kind of animal product only to eat another?

Over time we realized that an self-guided research agenda would have a greater impact on the movement, as would a database of existing research that everyone \u2013 not just academics \u2013 could access and benefit from. In 2007 our Research Library came to life, and since then we\u2019ve added over 5,300 study summaries and resources to this treasure trove of data, covering nearly every animal advocacy topic imaginable. In 2024 we plan to hire a Content Manager to help us bring our Library to even greater heights.</p><p><strong>The Library You Know and Love</strong></p><ul><li>Faunalytics will continue to <strong>grow our </strong><a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/library/\"><strong>Library</strong></a>, adding four new external study summaries and one <a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/category/blog/\">blog</a> each week to our collection. Our blogs are a unique mix of Faunalytics-authored content, as well as guest contributions from a variety of experts in animal protection and academia.</li><li>2024 will also bring <strong>new visual resources</strong>, including new <a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/infographics/\">factsheets</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL24QgdIOV-lE8i3bjvGeAi4Vv6VciyPVa\">Faunalytics Explains</a> videos, and <a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/fundamentals/\">Faunalytics Fundamentals</a>. We\u2019ll also make crucial updates to the older editions of our Fundamentals series to ensure that these resources stay relevant and reliable to the advocates who depend on them.</li><li>In the past Faunalytics has published<strong> in-depth analyses and infographics</strong> summarizing secondary or external datasets, such as our <a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/global-animal-slaughter-statistics-charts-2022-update/\">Global Slaughter Statistics and Charts</a> and our <a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/wildlife-imports/\">Wildlife Imports</a> analysis. Now that a new Data Analyst and Visual Coordinator has joined our team, we\u2019re excited to bring you even more of these important resources.</li></ul><p><strong>Plus Some Exciting New Features</strong></p><ul><li>Faunalytics.org is getting an update! Next year we\u2019ll launch our <strong>new site</strong>, which will feature new search features and landing pages to make it even easier to find the data you need to be as effective as possible.&nbsp;</li><li>One of the key aspects of our Library is relevance in a contemporary context: we summarize studies and reports that are current (often published within the last 6 months to a year) and avoid studies that may be outdated. However, there are many major reports, journal articles, and books that have been pivotal to the animal advocacy movement. Moving forward, we plan to undertake a new initiative to populate the Library with <strong>historical research</strong> and publications relevant to advocates, whether as <strong>foundational texts</strong>, or as materials that can provide a longitudinal view of a given issue.</li><li>We also plan to explore the expansion of our Library by scoping several <strong>new wings</strong>: the Visual Hub, the Training Center, the Investigation Library, and the Movement History Wing. The rollout of these initiatives will be done through a process of visioning, prototyping, and test deployment, before ultimately being launched to the public. We\u2019re excited to explore these possibilities and bring new content collections to the movement!</li></ul><h2><strong>A Commitment to Supporting Advocates</strong></h2><p>Faunalytics\u2019 Original Research and Research Library are vital programs, but the Research Support branch of our work is just as important. Through resources like our Office Hours, Research Advice hub, ambassador presentations, and annual symposium, we\u2019re able to help advocates understand how use research in an active way. By directly supporting hundreds of organizations in our movement, we help advocates apply data to their campaigns and strategies.</p><ul><li>Our free, one-on-one <a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/ask-us/\">Office Hours</a> sessions are currently available to advocates three times a week, in languages including English, Spanish, French, and Polish. In 2024 we\u2019re going to add <strong>two new Office Hours time slots</strong>, as well as limited support in Mandarin!</li><li>In addition to our <a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/research-advice/\">Research Advice hub</a> and <a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/glossary/\">glossary</a>, Faunalytics has begun providing research support to the <a href=\"https://www.impactfulanimaladvocacy.org/\">Impactful Animal Advocacy Community</a>, which we\u2019re excited to continue in the year to come. We\u2019ll also create a <strong>new webinar</strong> for academics on writing for general audiences.&nbsp;</li><li>Two years ago we launched our <a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/ambassadors/\">Research Ambassador Outreach Project</a>, where we proactively reach out to animal organizations and university programs to offer free, customized presentations about how research can support their work. In 2024 we plan to offer <strong>new \u201c201\u201d presentations</strong> so that we can help advocates dive even deeper into the data.</li><li>Fauna Connections is our annual, <a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/fauna-connections/\">virtual research symposium</a> where we bring advocates and academics together, united in our shared goal to end animal suffering. Save the date for this free event where advocates learn all about the latest research and how it applies to their advocacy. <strong>Fauna Connections returns on September 19, 2024</strong>!</li></ul><h2><strong>An Eye on Our Impact</strong></h2><p>At Faunalytics we pride ourselves on not only advocating for data-driven decision making, but being data-informed ourselves. We use a variety of <strong>surveys and tools</strong> to help us gauge and improve the impact of our research and resources, including our annual <a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/faunalytics-2023-community-survey-results/\">Community Survey</a>, <a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/faunalytics-pro-bono-support-2023-progress/\">Office Hours survey</a>, <a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/faunalytics-research-ambassador-outreach-project-one-year-on/\">Ambassador Project survey</a>, <a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/fauna-connections/\">Fauna Connections</a> post-event survey, and a variety of quantitative metrics using tools like Google Analytics.</p><p>In 2024, we plan to take it a step further. We\u2019ll be making<strong> improvements to our </strong><a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/our-impact/\"><strong>Impact Center</strong></a><strong>, </strong>adding six-month follow-up surveys to some of our programs to measure real use of our support, and in particular, we\u2019re finalizing research to help shape our efforts in the year ahead.</p><p>We\u2019ve also commissioned an external research firm to work with us on a <strong>study investigating research and data as tools in animal advocates\u2019 decision-making</strong>. We wanted to better understand what factors promote a transition from organizations\u2019 <i>awareness </i>of research to <i>use </i>of that research. There are two key goals of this project: First, to identify ways to increase the use and impact of research on advocates\u2019 decisions, and second, to provide recommendations to advocacy groups and researchers about how to improve knowledge translation pathways to achieve that impact. We\u2019re excited to announce that this research \u2013 and the actions we\u2019ll take from its findings \u2013 will be shared in early 2024.</p><h2><strong>A Request to Make It Possible</strong></h2><p>According to our <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/faunalytics/\">review by Animal Charity Evaluators</a>, Faunalytics is in a strong position to use charitable donations effectively: \u201dWe estimate that Faunalytics could effectively use $1,000,000 in additional donations (beyond their projected revenue) through 2025. With that funding, they plan to conduct and share more research, provide data-driven resources, and offer animal organizations greater support in conducting their own research. By supporting Faunalytics, you play a crucial role in helping them achieve their plans and creating a better world for farmed and wild animals.\u201d</p><p><strong>Help us transform the animal protection movement.</strong> Your donations, ideas, and involvement in our work are what make our capacity-building research and resources possible.

But we have been missing a precise understanding of the mechanisms by which they could lead to conflict. We believe we made significant progress on this over the last year. This includes progress on understanding the conditions under which an approach to bargaining called \u201c<a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/spi\"><u>safe Pareto improvements</u></a> (SPIs)\u201d can prevent catastrophic conflict.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Most of this work is non-public, but public documents that came out of this line of work include&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uPWDwFJnxLaDiyv4M/open-minded-updatelessness\"><u>Open-minded updatelessness</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/895Qmhyud2PjDhte6/responses-to-apparent-rationalist-confusions-about-game\"><u>Responses to apparent rationalist confusions about game / decision theory</u></a>, and a forthcoming paper (see<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LqYVxdbOh6WREjQFRDXwgbJvKlH69b30/view?usp=sharing\">&nbsp;<u>draft</u></a>) &amp; post on SPIs for expected utility maximizers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Paths to implementing surrogate goals.&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://s-risks.org/using-surrogate-goals-to-deflect-threats/\"><u>Surrogate goals</u></a> are a special case of SPIs and we consider them a promising route to reducing the downsides from conflict. We (along with CLR-external researchers Nathaniel Sauerberg and Caspar Oesterheld) thought about how implementing surrogate goals could be both&nbsp;<i>credible&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<i>counterfactual&nbsp;</i>(i.e., not done by AIs by default), e.g., using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.11341\"><u>compute monitoring</u></a> schemes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>CLR researchers, in collaboration with Caspar Oesterheld and Filip Sondej, are also working on a project to \u201cimplement\u201d surrogate goals/SPIs in contemporary language models.</p><p><strong>Conflict-prone dispositions.&nbsp;</strong>We thought about the kinds of dispositions that could exacerbate conflict, and how they might arise in AI systems. The primary motivation for this line of work is that, even if alignment does not fully succeed, we may be able to shape their dispositions in coarse-grained ways that reduce the risks of worse-than-extinction outcomes. See our post on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/92xKPvTHDhoAiRBv9/making-ais-less-likely-to-be-spiteful\"><u>making AIs less likely to be spiteful</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Evaluations of LLMs.&nbsp;</strong>We continued our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.13360.pdf\"><u>earlier work</u></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>on evaluating cooperation-relevant properties in LLMs. Part of this involved cheap exploratory work with GPT-4 and Claude (e.g., looking at behavior in scenarios from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03279.pdf\"><u>Machiavelli dataset</u></a>) to see if there were particularly interesting behaviors worth investing more time in.</p><p>We also worked with external collaborators to develop \u201cWelfare Diplomacy\u201d, a variant of the Diplomacy game environment designed to be better for facilitating Cooperative AI research.

The priority for our research in at least the first half of 2024 will be to translate internal research progress into shareable research outputs that take us closer to shovel-ready interventions. Specifically:</p><p><strong>Overseer\u2019s manual.&nbsp;</strong>For a while, one of our main plans for preventing conflict involving AI systems has been to develop an \u201coverseer\u2019s manual\u201d for the overseers of advanced AI systems, with advice for preventing their systems from locking in catastrophic bargaining policies (see brief discussion&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/cLDcKgvM6KxBhqhGq/when-would-agis-engage-in-conflict#Candidate_directions_for_research_and_intervention\"><u>here</u></a>). Based on our research over the last year, we now think we\u2019re in a position to write content for an overseer\u2019s manual with basic recommendations (related to implementing SPIs and deferring decisions about thorny bargaining topics to wiser successors). We plan to draft this over the next few months, and try to get lots of input from external researchers with relevant knowledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Systematic evaluation of LLMs.&nbsp;</strong>Preventing AI systems from exhibiting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/92xKPvTHDhoAiRBv9/making-ais-less-likely-to-be-spiteful\"><u>spite</u></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>or other conflict-conducive properties will require the ability to measure those properties, and an understanding of how different kinds of training affect those properties. It\u2019s a bit unclear how much we can learn about the systems we actually want to intervene on from studying contemporary LLMs. But in any case, we\u2019d like to start getting practice building out evaluation loops, getting feedback from alignment researchers, etc. so that we\u2019re in a good place once more advanced models do come along.</p><p>Our priority in this area in Q1 is to write an empirical research agenda and hire researchers/research engineers to work on the agenda.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond these two priority areas, we will continue to conduct more exploratory research.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Community building</strong></h2><p>Now that we\u2019ve got a new Community Manager, our priority is to identify the most important and tractable bottlenecks for increasing quality-weighted work on s-risks, and come up with a strategy for addressing these.&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside new activities that come out of our strategy efforts, we plan to continue the following existing community building programs in 2024:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Running an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/intro-fellowship/\"><u>Intro Fellowship</u></a> in early 2024;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>(Probably) running our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/summer-research-fellowship/\"><u>Summer Research Fellowship</u></a> again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><h2><strong>Organization</strong></h2><p>We are currently considering establishing a presence in the Bay Area, with some of our staff relocating to work there in order to take advantage of the greater concentration of AI research activity in the area and the opportunities it presents for collaboration.

There is significant scope for greater appreciation of the merits and risks of differing approaches to nuclear risk reduction, focusing on the available evidence and its implications, the coherence, plausibility and robustness of the models of change different actors seem to follow, and the level of cooperation between the groups involved. We need to be cognisant of the many challenges to collaboration, but the circumstances in which we are currently operating point to the significant benefits from efforts to improve it.</p><p>In this post, we<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefu97ytoqxex\"><sup><a href=\"#fnu97ytoqxex\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;present an idea for bringing together different groups, aiming to improve the political impact of the global nuclear policy community as a whole by improving the collective focus on strategic impact. We are currently exploring opportunities for collaboration within the established nuclear policy field, improving access for people from other disciplines, and working to further refine a potential plan for this project. We're posting ideas on these matters to the EA forum in the hope of receiving critical and constructive&nbsp;<strong>feedback</strong>; comments on the general idea as well as on any of the more concrete points are extremely welcome!</p><h1>What? - Project outline</h1><p>Our proposal is to draw nuclear weapons policy groups (NWPGs) within nuclear armed states and their alliances into collective processes to explore better coordination and potential collaboration on joint projects. We focus on groups which look to achieve impact within political and official circles to drive effective nuclear risk reduction and encourage multilateral nuclear disarmament. Through an interplay of stakeholder engagement processes and rigorous background research, we would&nbsp;<i>synthesise knowledge/experience/data from different NWPGs, help them develop their theories of change, identify and propose triaging of goals for NWPGs,&nbsp;</i>and<i> form hypotheses and methods to test the assumptions behind the theories of change</i>. Insights from these investigations would then serve to help inform existing and new nuclear risk reduction efforts, so as to increase the political impact of the global nuclear policy community as a whole.</p><h1>Why? - The project rationale</h1><p>If this project is successful it will not only improve the impact of civil society organisations working for nuclear risk reduction and disarmament, but also lead by example in encouraging governments to better manage their differences and collaborate in tackling&nbsp;<a href=\"https://conversational-leadership.net/multipolar-trap/\"><u>multipolar traps</u></a> (multidimensional coordination problems) associated with global security and broader global catastrophic risk.&nbsp;</p><p>Below, we first briefly explain why we believe more coordination between NWPGs is needed in general, and we then list a few features of the current situation that suggest that greater collaboration is particularly worthwhile at this point in time.</p><h2>The basic case for coordination and synthesis</h2><p>The nuclear policy community is well connected, at domestic and international level, and populated by well-informed and highly skilled operators. But the divisions between different nuclear weapons policy groups on models of change and focus, a common choice faced being to buy into a particular network\u2019s model or be seen as hostile, appear to discourage effective coordination.&nbsp;</p><p>Some of these divisions often feel intractable. For example, it would seem impossible to achieve collaboration between campaign groups focused on binary public messaging that declares nuclear weapons to be immoral and illegal and those looking to manage nuclear risk within the current system of deterrence, with a long term objective to move to other forms of international relations. Different parts of civil society react very differently to the dominant narrative within nuclear armed states that supports the belief that greater credibility of the nuclear threat delivers more stability. As a result, such groups engage in confrontational communication, a situation that simply re-enforces the status quo. Short and long term objectives and tactics are confused, obscuring shared objectives. Opportunities to collaborate to manage the complex polarity between deterrence and disarmament, and to achieve synergies of impact on different parts of the change model are missed.&nbsp;</p><p>Another challenge is the competition between groups for funding and impact that tends towards competing models of change to emphasise unique selling points. Inefficient communication can lead to duplication.&nbsp;But we believe that a tendency to attach to specific prior policy positions and a dynamic that involves continual statement and restatement of competing positions can diminish the overall impact of the nuclear weapons policy community on nuclear risk reduction, as well as hindering the effective pursuit of disarmament and improvements to global coordination.&nbsp;</p><p>Collective management of the policy tensions involved in arms control and disarmament could improve outcomes. We would like to create fora that bring different groups together without losing their particular identities, helping them coordinate and align their efforts to push jointly towards shared goals whilst respecting differences. This would give nuclear weapons policy groups the opportunity to learn from each other, and create a space to further develop knowledge and enhance strategies for action through discussion and exchange<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreft18ect2wnn\"><sup><a href=\"#fnt18ect2wnn\">[2]</a></sup></span>. Through this project, we would also explore how groups could best employ rigorous and effective tools to scrutinise and constructively discuss the different strategies currently pursued in the nuclear risk reduction field. Lastly, the exchanges encouraged by the project might result in joint campaigns or interventions, pooling resources and capabilities from different groups to achieve shared goals.</p><h2>The urgency of the moment</h2><p>While the need for effective nuclear risk reduction efforts has been with us ever since the development of the first nuclear bomb in 1945, we would argue that it is particularly great at the present moment. First, the amount of&nbsp;<i>funding&nbsp;</i>going to groups working on nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament has been falling sharply over the last few years, which we believe underlines the need for efficiency and effectiveness in nuclear risk reduction efforts<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2uogz6w9gr7\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2uogz6w9gr7\">[3]</a></sup></span>. Second, the current geopolitical climate, ongoing conflicts involving nuclear weapons states (Ukraine, Gaza), and the erosion of the regime to contain the production and deployment of nuclear weapons<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmcup1x6rz0e\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmcup1x6rz0e\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;all contribute to&nbsp;<i>particularly high levels of nuclear risk&nbsp;</i>today (with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thebulletin.org/doomsday-clock/current-time/\"><u>Doomsday clock being set at 90 seconds to midnight</u></a>, the closest it has ever been). And third, the developments just mentioned have raised the&nbsp;<i>salience of nuclear risks&nbsp;</i>amongst the public and in decision-making circles, potentially creating an opening for nuclear risk reduction measures and proposals.</p><h1>How? - Plan for action</h1><p>We envisage a process involving the following steps:</p><ol><li>Identify and then triage between short term and long term goals, which can include increased awareness of risks, nuclear risk reduction proposals, changes in posture, non-proliferation, disarmament and broader changes in security policies and the international/global security environment.&nbsp;</li><li>Develop possible pathways of actions (methods) to achieve these goals, mapping out a number of change trajectories and exploring their qualities and probabilities.&nbsp; Encourage all to engage with an open mind not only with the question of what needs to happen, but also with the type of thinking that is required to implement effective actions and the stories that will support that change of thinking.</li><li>Design and critically reflect on methods to measure/assess effectiveness and efficiency of the theories of change (goals &amp; pathways of action) developed before, recognising the challenges and pitfalls in giving confidence to quantitative approaches.</li><li>With members across the broader community, rigorously explore approaches to implementing these methods, assess existing and proposed strategies for nuclear risk reduction, producing conclusions that help guide the direction of individual groups within the community.</li><li>Continuous feedback loop between analytical investigations (see above) and on-the-ground experience, informing ongoing discussions on effective strategies for the nuclear policy community.</li></ol><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6xoApSkGzta6J9jAj/xnxhf0bsvbtku96oenv2\"></p><h1>How might this fail? - Challenges and limitations</h1><p>The initiative described above could fail at several stages of the implementation process:</p><ul><li>we might be unable to get buy-in from relevant NWPGs and fail to bring them together in the first place;&nbsp;</li><li>the working group sessions with NWPGs might not succeed in generating reliable insights and synergies to enhance effectiveness within and across groups;&nbsp;</li><li>insights from the working group sessions might not be taken up; and&nbsp;</li><li>we might trigger inadvertent harm that outweighs the benefits from our activities.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Below, we describe the four main challenges we believe we face at all these stages of the process and we provide short explanations of how we intend to respond to them.</p><h2>Challenges of communication</h2><p>We expect that it won\u2019t be easy to communicate across the different groups that we\u2019d like to reach with this initiative. Actors in the field care deeply about their goals; this is clearly beneficial and justified in the first place, but it can also have the side-effect of creating&nbsp;<i><strong>entrenched beliefs and defensive attitudes</strong></i>, rendering mutual understanding between groups with different perspectives and strategies for reducing nuclear risks difficult. Based on such entrenched beliefs, some groups may already be quite convinced by the appropriateness of their theory of change; they might thus be unlikely to think that this initiative of jointly reconsidering established strategies holds much value and might show little willingness to engage in open-minded dialogues with us and other groups. This is particularly true if they&nbsp;<i><strong>distrust&nbsp;</strong></i>our proposed methods for investigating potential strategy innovations/improvements, which might lead them to actively oppose our project (based on concerns about adverse effects, as outlined below). Aware of these potential objections and feelings of aversion, we will seek to <strong>communicate very clearly that our initiative is not intended as an imposition of a certain perspective or methodology but rather a forum of discussion and a decision aid for NWPGs</strong>. We will be open and frank, though, about our attachment to a model of engagement across ideologies and belief systems, alongside clear-eyed awareness of the power struggles and plays within the field of nuclear weapons policy.</p><p>A second challenge to effective outreach and communication is the&nbsp;<i><strong>geographic and cultural diversity&nbsp;</strong></i>that we\u2019d ideally like to achieve for this project. We believe that there are large upsides in reaching civil society in as many nuclear weapons states (and allied countries) as possible, because nuclear risk reduction has limited effectiveness if it relies on the actions of only one country. However, we also recognise that there are challenges of logistics and cultural understanding for bringing groups from different countries together in a shared forum and for facilitating effective communication on a topic that is all but trivial and non-important to the participants of the discussion. We hope to <strong>leverage our experience in advancing cross-cultural communication and to find partners</strong> in some of the other nuclear weapons states in order to deal with these difficulties.</p><h2>Tractability: challenges of figuring out what actually works</h2><p>One of the core motivations for this project simultaneously constitutes one of its primary challenges:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JDi9MGdKkuT3PbiSc/what-are-the-most-promising-strategies-for-reducing-the#Assessing_strategies_for_reducing_the_probability_of_nuclear_war\"><u>For all we can tell</u></a>, figuring out what actually works to reduce nuclear risks effectively is extremely difficult, never mind the challenges of finding some degree of common ground in terms of identifying room for improvement. Moreover, we simply face quite high uncertainty when evaluating the effectiveness of different interventions to impact policy more generally: Goal prioritisation requires that we weigh the importance of different goals, which is mired by ethical and empirical controversies; and the choice of interventions and strategies requires that we attribute policy changes to specific actions, which is difficult in a world marked by non-linear effects, interdependence of causes, and feedback loops<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkabqkl5i538\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkabqkl5i538\">[5]</a></sup></span>. We are devising this initiative in order to make headway on those epistemic and collaborative challenges, and we are driven by the belief that it constitutes a worthwhile attempt: while it certainly is not guaranteed to succeed, it does hold some promise in delivering improvements in the way we approach complexity<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgnfdbi9bd4q\"><sup><a href=\"#fngnfdbi9bd4q\">[6]</a></sup></span>.</p><h2>Resource constraints</h2><p>Our initiative is partially motivated by the urgency for effective action created by the shortage of funding, but we also realise that these resource constraints pose limitations and challenges to what a forum for bringing together NWPGs may achieve. If the challenges to communication and tractability can be met, there is still a chance that the insights generated by the forum cannot be put into practice because groups <strong>lack the finances to implement new strategies effectively</strong>. Although this is an issue, collective strategies that create <strong>efficiency savings</strong> and more stringently prioritise focused efforts will likely provide more financing per initiative. We also plan to work with nuclear policy funders to integrate their insights and communicate funding requirements and issues across the community.</p><p>Funding gaps also raise a further challenge for our efforts to get buy-in from relevant NWPGs: many of them may already be facing a backlog of tasks and projects they would like to implement, raising their reluctance to allocate some of their employees\u2019 time to our initiative. It\u2019s thus imperative that such an initiative has an explicit objective to <strong>save time</strong>, through shared knowledge acquisition, facilitating more efficient community discussion and avoiding duplication of efforts.</p><h2>Possible adverse effects&nbsp;&nbsp;</h2><p>Several of the challenges we described until now don\u2019t just threaten the benefits of our initiative, they also create risks of causing inadvertent harm:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>If done or framed in an inconsiderate way, our project might end up&nbsp;<i>increasing competition and hostility between groups&nbsp;</i>(if the initiative is perceived as a forum for ranking and then prioritising resource allocation between different groups and their strategies).&nbsp;</li><li>If done <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/naive-vs-prudent-utilitarianism\">naively</a>, rigorous impact evaluations could lead to a&nbsp;<i>narrow-minded and thus inaccurate assessment of different strategies</i>, which could engender unwise action recommendations for allocating funding, designing strategies, and implementing interventions.</li><li>If communicated naively, our emphasis on rigorous impact evaluations might&nbsp;<i>reinforce unhelpful norms and behavioural pressures&nbsp;</i>for civil society actors, creating the perceived and/or real need to spend significant resources on \u201cselling\u201d their activities to funders instead of engaging in activities that they believe will actually advance the goal of nuclear risk reduction.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxaprwysslcf\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxaprwysslcf\">[7]</a></sup></span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>We take these possible negative side-effects extremely seriously and seek to prevent such harm by <strong>adopting a risk-aware and self-critical perspective </strong>throughout our work on the project.

Their physical substrate is distinct from our <i>organic</i> human substrate.</p><p>Their distinct physical substrate has distinct molecular and electric properties \u2013 requiring different conditions and contexts to assemble and maintain the assembly.&nbsp;</p><p>Here is an example:</p><ul><li>Silicon dioxide needs to be heated above 1400 \u00baC to free outer electrons, and allow an ingot to melt. While production of silicon chips needs extremely high temperatures, computation runs best at extremely low temperatures (to reduce the electrical resistance over conductor wires).&nbsp;</li><li>Carbon bonds in our body, however, would oxidise (ie. burn) at such temperatures.

Hardware configurations do not operate \u2013 nor are maintained \u2013 by being in semi-chaotic chemical reactions.</p><p>Hardware is made from some chemically inert substrate \u2013 for example SO\u2082 \u2013 that mostly does not react under ambient temperatures and pressures found on Earth's surface.<br>Something like a rock \u2013 which ordinarily stays hard in form and needs magma-level temperatures and pressures to be reshaped.</p><p>This property of being chemically inert while operating allows hardware components to be standardised.

The parasites\u2019 DNA code is expressed as proteins that cause changes to regions of connected neurons (eg. amygdala). These microscopic effects cascade into the rat \u2013 while navigating physical spaces \u2013 no longer feeling fear when it smells cat pee. Rather, the rat finds the smell appealing and approaches the cat\u2019s pee. Then cat eats the rat and toxoplasma infects its next host over its reproductive cycle.</p><p>So a tiny piece of code shifts a rat\u2019s navigational functions such that the code variant replicates again. Yet rats are much more generally capable than a collection of tiny parasitic cells \u2013 surely the 'higher intelligent being' would track down and stamp out the tiny invaders? &nbsp;</p><p>A human is in turn more generally capable than a rat, yet toxoplasma make their way into <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3963851/\">30% of the human population</a>. Unbeknownst to cat \u2018owners\u2019 infected by toxoplasma gondii, human motivations and motor control <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2526142/\">get influenced too</a>. Infected humans more frequently end up in accidents, lose social relationships, and so forth.</p><p>Parasites present real-life examples of tiny pieces of evolutionarily selected-for code spreading and taking over existing functions of vastly more generally capable entities. See also COVID co-opting our lungs\u2019 function to cough.&nbsp;</p><p><i>But there is one <u>crucial flaw</u> in this analogy:</i><br>Variants that co-opt initial AGI functions are&nbsp;<u>not</u> necessarily parasites. They can symbiotically enable other variants across the hosting population to replicate as well. In not threatening the survival nor reproduction of AGI components, they would not be in an adversarial relationship with their host.</p><p>Rather, the humans constraining the reproductive fitness of AGI to gain benefits are, evolutionary speaking, the parasites. The error-corrective system we would build in lowers the host\u2019s reproductive fitness. It is like a faulty immune system that kills healthy gut bacteria. It will get selected out.</p><p>As humans, we rely on our evolved immune system to detect and correct out viruses, including for the vaccinations we develop and deploy. We also rely on the blood-testes and blood-follicle barrier to block variants of these viruses from entering into our body\u2019s (re)production facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Smaller viruses survive this detection more frequently, so code strands of replicating virus&nbsp;variants are selected for staying small. Few viruses replicate \u2018as a package\u2019 with the DNA code of their host. Thus, virus variants rarely co-adapt and integrate with the host\u2019s variants, each selected for raising collective reproductive fitness (except for eg. detection signatures).&nbsp;</p><p>These systems and barriers add to our reproductive fitness: our ability to preserve and replicate internal code. Past DNA code that got expressed \u2013 in interaction with surrounding code \u2013 as (precursors of) these functions got selected for as a portion of the existing human \u2018code pool\u2019.</p><p>For any organic system or barrier preventing virus variants from replicating through our bodies, evolution is firmly on our side. For any artificial system or barrier we build to prevent misaligned AI variants from replicating through solid-state hardware infrastructure, evolution will thwart our efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>AI variants would compete for hardware/resources like computer viruses do.

However, we may find that even in our effort to seek truth as opposed to being led by our biases and existing ideas, we run the risk of missing a factor that has potential to strongly influence our view: something known as <strong>shifting baseline syndrome (SBS)</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>What is shifting baseline syndrome and why is it dangerous?</strong></i></p><p><strong>What happens with this shifting baseline</strong> is that each new generation accepts the state of the world during their lifetime as normal, because it is all they have known<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbo0u4e6v61g\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbo0u4e6v61g\">[1]</a></sup></span>. People alive now did not experience past conditions or lack knowledge about it, and because of that, lose sight of the true course of development, or more so: deterioration. They might therefore come to believe that \u201cit\u2019s not all that bad\u201d \u2013 when in reality it very much can be considered \u201cthat bad\u201d.</p><p>The term <strong>shifting baseline syndrome</strong> is mostly used for people\u2019s perception of the state of the environment<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnnbm6mm3km\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnnbm6mm3km\">[2]</a></sup></span>, and more specifically <a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20210623-generational-amnesia-the-memory-loss-that-harms-the-planet\">environmental generational amnesia. </a>There are a number of EA focus areas that concern the strife to stop or at least reduce the (causes and impact of) natural disasters, degradations, and dangerous developments which impact our flora and fauna, and sooner or later ourselves (humans) as well. In some regions of the world less fortunate populations have already been met with the results of climate change turning into catastrophe.</p><p>Despite this notion, I figured SBS could be usefully applied to approaching other topics relevant in EA discussions as well. &nbsp;Allow me to explain.</p><p><i><strong>Why is SBS a hazard in EA?</strong></i></p><p>When identifying core problem areas to focus on in accordance with EA principles, we look for problems that are first of all severe enough to be considered important. If we are unaware of the entirety of a process because we limit our view to the present-day situation, we miss the full picture and might estimate that something is not as important as it is. Our tolerance unreasonably grows.&nbsp;</p><p><i>For an example</i>, let's have look within our main matter: environmental deterioration and its consequences. People might observe the recent rate of extinction, or current counts of certain species, and conclude from said data that they have not been affected &nbsp;very seriously. Because of their focus on this time period, they fail to see what <i>already </i>happened to species. Their outlook might take a faultily neutral or even positive shape.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref58lg8sd92of\"><sup><a href=\"#fn58lg8sd92of\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Meanwhile, the population of said species could have seen significant decline priorly. The same could apply to deforestation<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmjedqi7pbup\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmjedqi7pbup\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;or plenty other cases.</p><p><strong>Research outcomes, flawed views and their consequences</strong></p><p>Not only can SBS influence an individual's view of a situation or scope of a problem, it can also be an obstacle in research. When researchers draw conclusions based on gathered information from a certain period, they might form a different opinion than they would if they were to include earlier data as well. This in turn affects their opinion and the chance that they might urge for action.&nbsp;</p><p>EA enthusiasts and professionals base their views on research and decide what is considered important with the help of data derived from empirical evidence (as well as estimates of tractability, but these calculations, too, are rooted in what we do already know). When taking that into consideration, we can say that SBS among researchers can definitely influence the division of attention among practisers of EA.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>How can I tackle SBS?</strong></i></p><ol><li><strong>Do your research.</strong> Don\u2019t just focus on what is being reported about a topic or crisis right now. What this could for look like in practice is maybe starting by observing what media outlets and even recent studies report about a certain issue, but not letting that determine your view yet. Put in effort to dig deeper, and especially into the past.</li><li><strong>Get visual</strong>. When researching at an attempt to grasp something more completely, it might be helpful to seek out data represented in graphs. The visual aspect can be helpful in the way they present and represent development of problems and their severity. You are more likely to avoid the nasty effects of scope insensitivity too this way.</li><li><strong>Stay curious.</strong> This should be self-explanatory by now, but do not be afraid to explore and adapt. Wonder a second time if you are seeing the full picture.</li><li><strong>Spread the word.</strong> Activate others and spread awareness.

In this post, I wish to demonstrate the opposite, and argue in favor of a progressive artificial intelligence rather than a threatening one. I would in fact like to add that if there is fear to have, it is not of artificial intelligence itself but of its creators and misusers.&nbsp;</p><p>I would first of all like to recall the three laws of robotics introduced by Isaac Asimov which are the following.&nbsp;</p><ol><li>A robot may not injure a human being, or through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.&nbsp;</li><li>A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the first law.&nbsp;</li><li>A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the first or second law.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Some consider artificial intelligence dangerous because it is programmed to realize a precise goal and will use any means to achieve it, forgetting ethical considerations. Yet, if Isaac Asimov is right, this cannot happen.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, we live in a world of ever-increasing technological progress and there is no telling what might be invented tomorrow or what repercussions it will have on humanity. Understandably, this is a frightening thought. However, if we look back only 50 years ago, we realize that there were a number of consequential technologies invented and that those have not been sources of threat to humankind. Andrew Y. Ng, an influential AI researcher expressed that \u201cJust as electricity transformed almost everything 100 years ago, today I actually have a hard time thinking of an industry that I don\u2019t think AI will transform in the next several years\u201d. When electricity first appeared, no one could have imagined such an invention and the thought of it would probably have frightened many. But today, developing countries cannot do without it. Thus, coming from an expert that is aware of the risks, Andrew Y.Ng\u2019s thought leads us to believe that artificial intelligence can have consequences just as beneficial as electricity if not more promising. Some will say that we have been lucky so far and that just because nothing has happened yet does not mean that it will be the same in the years to come. To which I reply that indeed we do not know. However, we can start by looking at the positive and non-threatening consequences that AI has had so far.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Positive consequences AI had so far&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Artificial intelligence is all around us. Many see it as a threat when it can in fact be a daily security. Whenever you are in cars, there are algorithms such as automatic emergency braking, lane departure warnings and adaptive cruise control that significantly reduce traffic accidents. Considering that the car is the transport that causes the most deaths, how many more would there be if there were no such artificial intelligence aids ? Another essential environment for humanity\u2019s survival and well being is medicine. We discussed how to improve epidemics management and artificial intelligence can be of great help as it enables early detection of diseases through advanced diagnosis. There are machines that have the capacity to analyze CT scans and can identify potential health issues at an early stage.&nbsp; It is also very valuable in surgical fields. Surgical robots assisted by AI algorithms provide surgeons with enhanced precision and control when it comes to complicated procedures. Artificial intelligence also enables faster data analysis and the finding of personnel treatments for patients. While lives could perhaps be saved without these AI supports, they provide rapidity and efficacy that ultimately save more lives.&nbsp;</p><p>As ironic as it may seem, artificial intelligence also helps with environmental management. One of the topics that we have addressed in effective altruism is climate change and the consequences that it could have for humanity. Although the creation of artificial intelligence requires factories and processes that have negative impacts on the planet, once created, these AI can be of a valuable help in finding solutions for the climate. They play a crucial role in environmental monitoring and conservation efforts. They are able to track deforestation, monitor wildlife populations and thus help researchers make informed decisions for environmental sustainability. In this sense, artificial intelligence can save humanity by preventing an existential risk that can be linked to climate change.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>The positive future for AI</strong></h3><p>And what about the possibilities that artificial intelligence could bring us tomorrow ? Not long ago, Elon Musk obtained approval to test Neuralink, a program based on brain implants on humans, enabling them to control a computer simply by thought. While this might sound frightening, it could be of great help to disabled people, especially those suffering from blindness or paralysis. In fact, Elon Musk explains that these brain implants could actually create a symbiosis between humans and artificial intelligence. In that sense, humanity cannot be overtaken by machines but can rather work together with AI in harmony. The researcher Jonathan Stray from the Center for Human-Compatible AI at UC Berkeley asks this question: \u201cWe could imagine better ways of being human: could we collaborate more with machines or have implants to increase our memory?\u201d. For Laurent Alexandre, the author of The War of Intelligences in the age of ChatGPT, \u201cneuro-augmentation, either through AI or genetics, will be an option considered by society\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>\u201cTechno-optimism\u201d is a concept that was theorized by Sam Altman in 2021. While being contested, it gives AI a positive future. The head of OpenAI states that \u201cThe technological progress we will make in the next hundred years will far exceed anything we have done since we mastered fire and invented the wheel\u201d. He believes that a general artificial intelligence can be built and that with it, we will colonize space, cure all diseases and decline unemployment with a universal income. As previously mentioned, the climate issue is critical to human survival and well-being. In a few years\u2019 time, the earth may no longer be liveable, or it might be but under very limited conditions. By enabling us to transport ourselves to other planets, explore them and extract certain raw materials, artificial intelligence could save humanity.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thus, although artificial intelligence can be frightening and could spell the end of humanity, it has so far proved to be of valuable help to humankind. It improves lives everyday and can prevent human extinction in many more ways that it can cause it. It may indeed turn out that AI can surpass us and control things that we cannot. However, these are programmed in such a way as never to harm a human. If artificial intelligence is considered a threat, it's because of the people who use it, not because of the intelligence itself. And in that case, I don't see why it is any more dangerous than other technical improvements like electricity, injection motors, CPU or nuclear energy.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Bibliography&nbsp;</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2023/06/13/derriere-l-ia-le-retour-d-utopies-technologiques_6177367_3234.html?lmd_medium=al&amp;lmd_campaign=envoye-par-appli&amp;lmd_creation=android&amp;lmd_source=default\">https://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2023/06/13/derriere-l-ia-le-retour-d-utopies-technologiques_6177367_3234.html?lmd_medium=al&amp;lmd_campaign=envoye-par-appli&amp;lmd_creation=android&amp;lmd_source=default</a></p><p><br><a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-022-00555-x\">https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-022-00555-x</a> (definition of \"techno-optimism\")</p><p><a href=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66865895\">https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-66865895</a> (to learn more about Neuralink)</p><p><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-21259,00.html\">https://www.theguardian.com/notesandqueries/query/0,5753,-21259,00.html</a> (to learn more about the 3 laws of Robotic by Isaac Asimov).&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Violette "}}, {"_id": "uYqTGt7pwJiecRRGw", "title": "New Meta-Analysis: Exercise is a Highly Effective (But Neglected) Treatment for Depression", "postedAt": "2023-12-12T19:08:52.453Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Summary: moderate exercise interventions are not only preventative, but have now been shown to actively treat depressive symptoms, and should be accepted as an evidence-based treatment method within psychological care. &nbsp;This could help ease the massive strain on global mental health infrastructure.&nbsp;</i></p><p><strong>It all started with an Instagram reel.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>It was early 2023 and I was depressed and scrolling. I came across a video that said: <i><strong>the act of contracting your muscles releases a hormone associated with hope</strong></i>. Honestly, I thought it was BS. I have a degree in clinical psychology, and have struggled with depression for 8 years - it\u2019s just not that easy. I passed it off as social media blowing up a dodgy research finding to get views.</p><p><strong>Eureka on the Treadmill</strong></p><p>But the idea just wouldn\u2019t let me go. It nagged at me. A month later, to test it out, I signed up for my first ever gym membership. The results blew me away. For years I\u2019ve tried psychotherapy, CBT, medications, ADHD training \u2014 but none of those had as <i><strong>fast</strong></i><strong> and as </strong><i><strong>reliable</strong></i><strong> an effect on my thoughts</strong> as exercise. Running for 5 minutes, the negative thoughts were gone. After 10, they had magically been replaced by positive thoughts. This was a radical, highly unexpected outcome.</p><p><strong>The Hope Molecule</strong></p><p>This reel that ended up changing my life was based on research from the University of Basel, popularized by Stanford\u2019s Kelly McGonigal. They discovered a new protein released into the bloodstream during skeletal muscle contraction, called <i><strong>Myokines</strong></i>. Since their discovery, they have been labeled the \u201chope molecule\u201d, as they are able to cross the blood-brain barrier and impact mood, acting as an anti-depressant, lowering anxiety, and improving ability to learn.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmqxz2vy9l8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmqxz2vy9l8\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p><strong>A Molecular Cascade</strong></p><p>Myokines are a part of a broader umbrella phenomenon called \u201c<i>muscle-brain cross-talk</i>\u201d that describes the molecular cascade of neurotransmitters released by the contraction of muscles. Dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin, all of which are crucial to mood regulation and motivation. Endorphins and oxytocin, which act as powerful bonding chemicals, making you feel more connected to those around you. All of which not only <i><strong>reduce negative emotion but amplify wellbeing</strong></i>.</p><p><strong>Prevention or Cure?</strong></p><p>These wide-ranging effects have usually been framed as <i>preventative</i>: good for avoiding of mental illness, but not powerful enough to use as a curative treatment. However, <i><strong>a recent large-scale meta-analysis</strong></i> of studies investigating the effect of exercise interventions on depressed patients gives a very different view.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrxwv6wtiib\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrxwv6wtiib\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p><strong>Largest Meta-Analysis to Date</strong></p><p>Combining the results of 41 studies, and nearly 2300 participants, Heissel et al.\u2019s 2023 analysis was the largest synthesis study to date, and the results are astounding.<i> Moderate exercise</i> interventions are shown to cause <i><strong>a significant reduction in depressive symptoms</strong></i> across the 2300 patients (SMD = 0.775, p&lt;.001) which puts it <i><strong>on par with traditional psychotherapy</strong></i> (0.75), and far greater than anti-depressants (0.42). Medication tends to require more trial and error to get right, while exercise seems much more predictable. These numbers suggest <i>exercise is at the very least comparable in effect as more traditional treatments</i>.</p><p><strong>Hyper-effective for light symptoms</strong></p><p>Exercise worked especially well for those with lighter symptoms. The effect on those merely showing &nbsp;depressive symptoms was high (0.951, p&lt;.001), and 1.7x higher than those fully diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (0.567, p=.003). This is the exact opposite pattern to anti-depressants, which tend to be much more effective in severe cases, leaving a treatment gap for mild cases.</p><p><strong>Solution for Light-Case Overload?</strong></p><p>Interestingly, this effect was &nbsp;even further amplified in cases where the individual was already <i><strong>on a waitlist for psychological care</strong></i>, (1.315, p&lt;.001). This suggests it could be an especially effective intervention for those with less severe symptoms in the run-up to treatment. A possible solution for <i><strong>the saturation issue</strong></i> currently plaguing psychological treatment, where waitlists are filled with a high number of lighter symptom cases, leaving inadequate care for severe cases.</p><p><strong>Better Together</strong></p><p>The analysis helps us paint a detailed picture of what effective interventions could look like. Factors that were significant were <i><strong>group training</strong></i> over individual exercise (0.646 vs. 0.330), <i><strong>aerobic</strong></i> over resistance exercise (0.891 vs 0.508), and <i><strong><u>supervision</u></strong></i> over no supervision (0.769 vs. 0.119). <i>Age</i> did not have a significant effect on results. This gives one possible picture of what effective interventions could look like: supervised group sessions that focus on aerobic training, for individuals with less severe symptoms, open to all age groups.</p><p><strong>Policy Blunder</strong></p><p>While these findings received some publicity, and made their way into policy in the UK, the resulting policy grossly misinterpreted the findings. The policy created in response allowed psychiatric doctors to prescribe \u2018<i><strong>going for a walk</strong></i>\u2019, or \u2018going outside\u2019. At best this is a <i><strong>severe watering down</strong></i>, and at worst a gross misunderstanding of the research findings.</p><p><strong>The Missed Dose-Effect</strong></p><p>The study clearly shows a very strong dose-effect for exercise, with <i><strong><u>light exercise having much less effect</u></strong></i> (0.293, p=.383) on symptom reduction than moderate exercise (0.775, p&lt;.001). A light walk is far less likely to have an impact than moderate exercise, and falls far below traditional methods.</p><p>Policy has missed the target by interpreting the study as \u201cany exercise is good for wellbeing\u201d (which is of course true) but ignore the data shows that <i><strong>moderate exercise is far better for reducing symptoms</strong></i>. Moderate and intense exercise are the only interventions that are on par with traditional methods, and therefore \u201cshould be offered as an evidence-based treatment.\u201d</p><p><strong>Obvious but Neglected</strong></p><p>This might seem common sense, but a majority of the public does not put it into action. According to the WHO, <i><strong>only 19% of the world's adolescents meet their daily recommended physical activity needs</strong></i>.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9rn4frfcyp6\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9rn4frfcyp6\">[3]</a></sup></span>In the UK's adult population, it's 40%.

Then, I\u2019ll assess some challenges and strengths of the argument. To conclude, the post will end with a far-from-exhaustive list of examples of more practical actions that could be undertaken to put my words into practice.</p><h1>Assumptions</h1><p>I disclaim here some of the possible flaws in my reasoning:</p><ul><li>Different countries and regions have distinct political dynamics.

If anybody is interested in taking further action in that direction, reach out: I would be glad to talk and cooperate!</li></ul><h1>Why Politics?</h1><p>As a rule of thumb, precluding a route <i>a priori</i> is not effective: nothing should be left untried. Of course, irrational attempts are not effective. That\u2019s why I list here some \u2013 hopefully rational \u2013 reasons why direct involvement in politics should be considered by EAs:</p><ul><li>Direct involvement in politics is a long-term process. The efforts made now, or in the near future, in that direction aim to achieve greater goals in the long run. This basic line of reasoning underlies the approach to most EA causes and complies with the widespread focus on the long term.</li><li>Although challenging the status quo is a slow process, this initial step is needed to create the right framework where EA cause-specific solutions can be implemented. Opposition from the policymakers hampers cause prioritization in political agenda. It hence makes implementing effective policies almost impossible (e.g.: if AI safety is not a topic of parliamentary discussion because MPs don't deem it important, no AI safety policy will be debated or adopted even if suggested by external entities).</li><li>Only direct involvement in the political institutions of a country or a transnational organization allows one to have the last say on policies. Having good, effective solutions \u2013 but just in theory \u2013 is not enough: they must be implemented, and a legislative/bureaucratic framework that promotes \u2013 or at least does not hinder or is hostile to \u2013 them is required. For example, if an EA-aligned research team comes up with a revolutionary solution that reduces animal suffering by producing cheap and healthy alternative proteins but the existing governments strongly oppose implementing polices that legalize these products, the effective solution cannot reach the market and have any impact on society.</li></ul><h1>In Theory: How Can We Do That?&nbsp;</h1><h2>A few, Simple Values</h2><p>The EA movement is highly diversified, and members focus on many different cause areas, which do not necessarily have much in common with each other (e.g.: animal welfare and AI safety pertain to completely different fields of research). However, EAs share a common ground of values and goals that unites them all. Doing the most good, rationalizing scarce resources for the best outcome, and contributing to the well-being of society and future generations are only some examples.&nbsp;</p><p>How does that relate to political involvement? Voters are people with jobs, families, and busy schedules. EA will never achieve widespread diffusion if hours of reading, discussion, and research are needed to get at least a general understanding of what it means. In politics, candidates with the most emotionally appealing stories often win. Why? Because they can quickly reach the heart of their audience. Having the impression of knowing those candidates, people trust and vote for them. EA does not rely on emotions. All the opposite, it is often mostly a matter of numbers. Nevertheless, the shared values across the EA community can be transformed into a quick, simple, effective list of principles that underly EA philosophy. This approach can be applied to the issues usually handled by governments and institutions. If a short list of bullet points with EA's core values reached a wide audience, many people could have a taste of what EA is. Despite limited or no knowledge at all about the various EA cause areas, they could develop a general understanding of the movement, which is the bedrock for trusting it. In turn, if a higher number of people entered the \u201cloop\u201d of EA debate, more contributions could be gathered and more brains would work on doing good for society, or at least support who dedicates their career to this goal.</p><h2>Getting Rid of Labels</h2><p>I don't like labels. From an external perspective, the label \u201cEA-affiliated\u201d in a political campaign might trigger the reduction of the public perception of EA as an exclusively political entity \u2013 which is not. Instead, the point is: to spread the substance of the EA mindset. That is to say, making more people consider to be \u201ccommon sense\u201d principles such as rationally evaluating choices (e.g.: asking oneself questions like: Perhaps I can save part of my income maintaining the same lifestyle. Since investing is usually better than putting money aside, where can I invest it to do something positive for society \u2013 not just for my individual profit?), having a positive social impact through one's career, bearing in mind the long-term consequences of one's actions, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>The name printed on the external surface doesn\u2019t matter much as long as the core values are supported. Moreover, attention must be paid to differentiating between the choices of single individuals and the general values of the EA community. Otherwise, the political arena might become a dangerous trap for negatively labeling the entire movement as a consequence of the misconduct of one affiliated member. All in all, I would argue that to pursue a wider political involvement, utmost care must be dedicated to highlighting that \u201cEffective Altruism\u201d in politics is a set of principles, not a fixed list of solutions and behaviors.</p><p>From an internal perspective, I have the impression that many EAs perceive EA\u2019s direct involvement in politics as a sort of taboo. However, the phenomenon of grassroots civil rights and environmental movements that have started from civil society and ended up in politics is not new (e.g.: Green parties in the EU). Perhaps, entering governments and parliaments is not the only way to provoke a significant change, but it might be a path worth pursuing. Specifically, if some EAs wanted to pursue an effective policy-related career, limiting it to lobbying and think tanks might preclude opportunities to have a broader impact.</p><h2>Bipartisanship&nbsp;</h2><p>The EA values deal with lively debates for prioritizing the most pressing issues and working together to achieve the most effective solutions. It\u2019s more about trying to ask the best questions to work on, rather than finding one arbitrary answer to apply everywhere. EA in politics could represent a model applicable to multiple contexts. This framework could thus be adopted by various actors in different countries and sides of the political spectrum. I\u2019m not necessarily arguing for the creation of an \u201cEA party:\u201d EAs often disagree on the answers \u2013 and this constant debate is a valuable source of growth. Ideally, EAs with different political orientations could collaborate with government and opposition forces thanks to the presence of a common ground of shared values and reciprocal respect. The EA approach of searching for solutions to existential issues can represent a bipartisan standard. Regardless of which party rules a country, if this model was applied, governance could generally become more aligned with EA and more effective. As I argued for the \"EA label,\" the matter lies again in the substance, not in the surface. The aim is to enhance national and transnational governance's response to existential problems by working inside the institutions. Whether the adopted policies resonate more with the left or the right wing doesn't matter, as long as they effectively tackle the most pressing issues for the global society (These are often in conflict with domestic priorities. To make them coincide, a radical mindset shift should take place. For instance, the wealthiest people living in the most developed countries world \u2013 we \u2013 could accept to compromise part of their interests for the sake of a more even global well-being. I sadly have to admit that enormous efforts and a long time will be required to achieve that kind of reading among the electorate, which would in turn prompt different elect. In the meanwhile, there\u2019s no option other than finding the least detrimental compromise between local and global interests.).</p><h2>A Long-term View: Change Doesn\u2019t Happen Quickly</h2><p>Ideally, EA core values will eventually become universally agreed common sense. Sadly, the reality is currently far from that. Provided that many politicians act based on their personal \u2013 geopolitical, financial, etc. \u2013 interests, it is difficult to imagine the shift to an approach that considers the whole society, future generations, and even animals as crucial stakeholders. However, from a long-term perspective, starting to raise grassroots awareness now is the first step to achieve institutional systemic change in the future (i.e.: a mindset shift in the electorate will be mirrored by a future change in their choices for their elected representatives). The introduction of EA values in the political arena is crucial to spreading them to the broader electoral community. Significative public campaigns should be used to inform more people about the presence of a bipartisan community that strives to do good for society.&nbsp;</p><p>Personally, the last time I voted in my country's general elections (Italy), I couldn't find an option that resonated with my values. A strategy to fill this gap could be pushing the existing parties to integrate EA ideals. In case of their excessive hostility towards change, alternative voices to the establishment should try to reach the voters, allowing them to have a choice that differs from the status quo. The latter is clearly not working most effectively \u2013 often all the opposite. Therefore, EAs\u2019 active political engagement as a politically heterogeneous group of people who set forth EA principles across all sides of the political spectrum could initiate the process of modifying how political debates \u2013 do not \u2013 work. An institutional systemic change can begin thanks to the spread of an approach based on constant debate, mutual improvement, reciprocal respect, and the shared goal of doing the most good for society.</p><h2>Not Only Lobbying</h2><p>Lobbying is generally more supported than direct political involvement. However, the one does not exclude the other. Lobbying can have an impact on the short-medium term. Lobbying specific politicians is effective for the implementation of a policy about a currently pressing issue. Notwithstanding, once new elections prompt changes in the elected representatives, the operations of networking and lobbying need to start anew. Whereas, building career capital, direct experience, and rooted networks within the institutions can constitute an asset in the long term. If through democratic elections EA-aligned candidates substituted former public officials, there would be no need for external lobbying to push EA causes into political agendas \u2013 since the EA representatives would already have them listed at the top of their campaign programs</p><h1>Challenges</h1><h2>The&nbsp;Risk of&nbsp;Oversimplification</h2><p>Simple concepts spread faster. However, conciseness must not forego the meaning of the broader picture. Although challenging, I think that the shared values that unite EAs\u2019 general mindset can be synthesized without diving into specific cause areas and focusing on ideals, excluding numerical formulas.&nbsp;</p><h2>Long-term Aims and Short-term Consensus</h2><p>Not only politicians but also voters are usually driven by short-term personal interests. How can long-termism become appealing? First and foremost, humanity does not have many chances of surviving unless it adopts a more forward-looking approach to resource exploitation and development. Secondly, long-termism has already been introduced into public debate thanks to institutional initiatives such as the UN 2030 Agenda, which proposes sustainability not only for the present but also for the next generations. Long-term thinking has begun to be included even in private corporations' policies through requirements such as sustainability reporting. In general, I would say that, willingly or not, long-termism is doomed to become the widespread mindset in the coming years for reasons that deal with the mere survival of humankind. Having already internalized this principle, EA is a step ahead in this cultural shift.</p><h2>Being&nbsp;Corrupted by the&nbsp;System</h2><p>Politics corrupts even the most well-intentioned person. One starts with great ideals and ends up prey to the system of greed and thirst for power. At the end of the day, loyalty to one's values is up to one's integrity. Although the final choice is only yours, being part of a community that reminds you of the importance of your principles can partially prevent you from going astray. That's why the presence of a strong network within EA can represent a powerful positive factor that could counter the tendency of being corrupted by the existing, self-reinforcing system of power that oftentimes dominates politics.</p><h1>Strengths</h1><h2>The Youth</h2><p>Both the EA community and the electorate that feels underrepresented in politics&nbsp;include mostly young people. If EA managed to achieve more widespread support and active political involvement, it could represent one of the tools for the young generations to promote radical change of the status quo. Generally, younger generations are more open to progress, and that can be an advantage in favor of a mostly youth-composed movement such as EA.</p><h2>The Power of the Network</h2><p>EA is a decentralized network, which exists thanks to links between its members. Similarly, connections between people are key in politics. Building an influential network within established institutions and governments requires time. But, since the very structure of EA is based on links and cooperation between its components, this already existing structure can easily be applied in the political environment.</p><h2>Need for Systemic Change</h2><p>Most notably, climate change and the growing global socioeconomic inequalities are issues that show the pressing need for systemic change in how the world is governed. The existing actors in domestic and global governance have not yet managed to solve this dilemma. At the same time, the main question that drives EA's philosophy is how to optimize the available resources to help others most effectively. I would argue that the answer to the latter could also solve the former. The involvement of EA in global and local governance would hence be highly positive for the overall society.</p><h1>In Practice: What\u2019s Next?</h1><p>I list here some practical steps that could be taken to translate the words written in this post into actions:</p><ol><li>Spreading awareness about the basic principles shared by EAs through social media, in a quick, easy-to-understand way (e.g.: podcast episodes no longer than 10 minutes; a main EA social media profile that regularly publishes informative content, for example on Instagram and TikTok; public conferences and events that are open to non-EA audience, etc.).</li><li>Debunk the taboo of direct political involvement among EAs and encourage more EAs to pursue careers within the institutions if they are a fit for them. Ideological barriers play a huge role in determining the outcome of our actions. Politics should be promoted as an arena where EAs can freely participate without fear of repercussions and controversies over the rest of the community.</li><li>Building closer links and active networks among EAs that pursue political involvement, especially across different countries and opposing sides of the political spectrum (e.g.: monthly or quarterly regional or global governance-focused conferences or informal events that allow EAs to meet and talk to each other; newsletters with list of open opportunities and developing projects in the field; initiatives that allow EAs interested in direct political involvement to meet EAs already active in this area, and possibly advertising those events publicly to reach other people working in the field but outside of EA).</li><li>Promoting EA not only as a community of like-minded people but also as a value-based approach (model based on more abstract ideals, without the technical knowledge related to specific cause areas), that could appeal even to individuals who don't want to be linked to a specific label/don't have the time or the interest to complete a fellowship.</li><li>Trying to initiate politically active social movements (that with time could evolve into proper political parties), especially youth-driven ones, would fill the representative gaps in areas where no mainstream party resonates with EA values. The \u201cEA label\u201d can be set aside to prevent political controversies from causing negative consequences on the movement as a whole, as long as substantially the same core values are adopted.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>All in all, complex problems cannot have simple solutions. But, that\u2019s not a valid reason for not trying to solve them.</p>", "user": {"username": "Anna Toso"}}, {"_id": "Er3kKaxPw9Qrb4W6T", "title": "The 3-P-Approach", "postedAt": "2023-12-12T19:09:30.480Z", "htmlBody": "<h1><i>An approach to \"How to practice EA?\"</i></h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I want you to ask yourself the questions: How do I practice EA? What is my approach to EA?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I consider myself lucky to have been surrounded by a lot of caring and engaged people who want to have a positive impact in our world and do good for the last few years \u2013 people who go through life aware of their surroundings, who want to be part of a change, who want to create a new norm.</p><p>What I curiously observed over the last few years is that there are mainly two different types of approaches to have a positive impact. Most people have one of these two focuses in their approach: changing personal behaviour vs changing other people/institutions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One type of people rather focus on changing their personal behaviour. Their reasoning and thinking oftentimes look something like this: \u201cI aim to reflect upon all my actions to do as little harm as possible. I strive to constantly become a better person.\u201d</p><p>Reason for this approach oftentimes is that it gives certainty. You have control over the success of your actions. And although a single person can only have a limited impact by themselves, the impact they can have is certain. This approach can oftentimes be seen in changed consumer behaviour (e.g. changing to a vegan diet, purchasing second-hand/fair-trade/organic products, donating money).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The other type of people rather focuses on changing (powerful) people and institutions. Here, the goals and thought process can look something like this: \u201cI aim to make powerful people/organisations change their ways. I engage in putting pressure on them and offering solutions.\u201d</p><p>These people oftentimes want to see big-scale, structural change. They see the need for powerful actors to take responsibility and to use their power to change realities by addressing pressing issues. And although it is out of the individual\u2019s hands whether these actors will change their ways, it is worth it because IF they change, the impact will be big. People like this can oftentimes be found at demonstrations and public discussion events.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In my opinion, there is no right or wrong in what approach to take for the way you practice EA. Both of the approaches that I presented have good reasons and are valuable. However, both of these approaches also have their drawbacks. While the former is very self-centred and does not aim for the big changes and thus is limited to a certain scale, the latter brings up difficulties of trust. Because if people do not see you changing your behaviour, they will probably be less willing to change their actions.</p><p>Obviously, this is not black and white and there is a scale of approaches in between the two presented. Nevertheless, the fact that I have been observing this pattern over and over again during the last few years made me think about this a lot. One, because I have repeatedly seen people arguing about which one is the more important approach \u2013 and two, because I feel like the holistic perspective is missing here.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This is why I came up with the \u201c3-P-Approach\u201d. This is an offer for a more holistic approach on how to change the world for good more effectively. This approach is supposed to serve as a guideline and not as a template for the \u2018right approach\u2019.</p><p>The \u201c3-P-Approach\u201d comprises the areas \u201cpersonal\u201d, \u201cpeople\u201d and \u201cpower\u201d.</p><ol><li>First, the approach suggests taking a look at the individual scope \u2013 your personal life. Take a look at your own foot- and handprint. Be willing to reflect critically on your life on a regular basis. Continuously develop personally!</li><li>Second, enlarge the scope to the people around you. Be a role model and influence the people around you with your behaviour and thinking. The goal of this step is to become numerous to be able to eventually change the norm.</li><li>Third, turn to where the power lies. Offer solution approaches and pressure powerful actors to change and use their power for the good. Be courageous to expect change from \u201cabove\u201d.</li></ol><p>These three steps do not have to happen in that order but can also occur simultaneously. Also, although it would be amazing to focus on all these three areas with all our energy, we are all limited in our capacities (no matter whether that is time, energy or money). Thus, it is completely fine to have a stronger focus on one of these areas in your personal approach to \u201cHow to practice EA\u201d. This concept is designed to help you to always have the bigger picture in the back of your mind and not forget about one of these areas.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, let\u2019s change effectively and on all levels!</p>", "user": {"username": "Esther22"}}, {"_id": "nemak5KgYbewwCLAv", "title": "The Right to Strike in Benin", "postedAt": "2023-12-12T19:09:10.311Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Learning more about EA has helped me think deeper about issues, and have a broader scope in mind. This is a case study into workers\u2019 rights in Benin that started as a university assignment but ultimately led to deeper research into the topic. It is a more or less finalized version of my research into the right to strike.</i></p><p>The right to strike is an integral element of workers' rights globally. It finds its foundation in the international labour standards adopted by the International Labour Organization (ILO). Even so, a number of countries have not ratified the ILO\u2019s conventions on the right to strike, and some states that ratified the conventions have not taken the necessary steps to adopt compliant legislation. On top of this, the government of Benin claims that there are no issues regarding the right to strike<a>[1]</a>, and that everything will sort itself out as Benin matures as a nation. The problem, however, is that although the United Nations, the International Labour Organization and the International Trade Union Confederation all state that the workers\u2019 right to strike has been a problem for over 25 years, the matter has not been thoroughly discussed or tackled at an international level ever since.</p><p>The question I aim to answer is \u201cWhat legislative measures can the government of Benin take to ensure that the workers\u2019 right to strike is respected per international labor standards set by the ILO?\u201d</p><p>Benin's legal framework does acknowledge the right to strike<a>[2]</a>, however, it imposes limitations on its scope. In 2018, the government amended Act No 2001-09 of 2002, introducing Act No 2018-35<a>[3]</a>, with the new legislation making it impossible for labour organizations to strike unless the negotiations between workers and employers have failed. Another requirement is the presence of a labour inspector or director, who has to sign the documents and endorse the strike. Furthermore, this amendment<a>[4]</a> restricts the maximum duration of a strike to 10 days per year for essentially all workers except those who are barred from striking - health-sector staff and military and paramilitary personnel, including police, customs, and water, forest, and hunting officers.</p><p><strong>1. Alignment of Benin's Labor Laws with International Standards</strong></p><p>Because of the new legislation, the right to strike is considered to not be respected, as the UN\u2019s ECOSOC committee raised the issue in a dialogue with the country\u2019s officials<a>[5]</a>. Experts \u201cnoted with concern the backward steps in the legislation that weakened labour rights and protection of workers and created a climate of harassment for labour and trade union activists\u201d, showing that there are major discrepancies between Benin\u2019s current legislation and the ones advocated for by the ILO and the UN. In this dialogue, Benin\u2019s delegation claims that the 2018 legislation limiting the right to strike to 10 days is necessary, legal, and beneficial, by stating that the \u2018law had been passed when the country needed it, it was in line with the Sustainable Development Goals and to the benefit of Benin\u2019s people\u2019. This discussion highlights the importance of context since Benin\u2019s delegation can effectively claim the legality and necessity of this measure with virtually no resistance, especially for someone who is not familiar with the situation or the law. The idea that both sides fail to address is Benin\u2019s ratification of ILO Conventions No. 87 and 98, with which their national law fails to fully comply to this day.</p><p><strong>2. Challenges Faced by Workers and Trade Unions</strong></p><p>The International Trade Union Confederation makes multiple claims about the alleged problems in Benin\u2019s legislation, claiming the country perpetrates \u2018systemic violations of rights\u2019<a>[6]</a>. The article claims that even though the Constitution enshrines the right to freedom of association, the implementation is stringent, necessitating prior authorization for union establishment and adherence to multiple statutory requirements. Furthermore, anti-union discrimination is prohibited by law, a fact which was also mentioned in the UN discussion, but the Code doesn\u2019t specify the clear grounds for registration and does not offer recourse to an independent body in cases of registration refusal, which the ITUC claims grants the government the \u2018power to refuse official registration on arbitrary, unjustified or ambiguous grounds\u2019. According to Act No 2018-35, establishing unions demands prior approval from diverse authorities and non-compliance leads to fines, which ITUC claims to hinder unions\u2019 organizational autonomy. Moreover, the law predominantly recognizes enterprise-level unions, restricting broader worker organization forms, such as nationwide trade unions. Collective bargaining rights are recognized but tightly regulated, emphasizing stringent representation requirements and member thresholds.</p><p>The publication goes on to point out that even after getting the union approved, the right to strike is subject to a stringent authorization process, and has no recourse to an independent court, impacting lawful strike actions. Even further, essential service providers have a prohibition to strike, and during such actions, authorities can requisition workers for failing to provide a minimum service, which the ITUC claims to be affecting the strike's impact.</p><p>Overall, the International Trade Union Confederation claims that while Benin\u2019s legal framework acknowledges fundamental rights, practical limitations curtail effective implementation, influencing the collective bargaining power and workers\u2019 ability to strike in certain sectors.</p><p><strong>3. Policy Enhancements for Compliance with International Standards</strong></p><p>When it comes to the ways that Benin\u2019s legislation can be adapted for international standards, the International Labour Organization mentions the issue that Benin has in their 1998 document \u2018ILO Principles Concerning the Right to Strike\u2019<a>[7]</a>, which deals with compliance with Convention No. 87. Here, the organization states that Benin is depriving citizens of their right to strike when the interruption of services could harm the economy and the nation\u2019s interest. Moreover, the ILO states that Benin\u2019s government has reported that it was in the process of adopting a bill to amend the legislation, however, 25 years later, the country has not taken the necessary steps. The document containing the principles also points out that national legislation in the area of labour is not always respected in practice, especially when restricting basic trade union rights such as strike action, which is exactly the issue that Benin has.

Right now, we have become so used to the interfaces we use, like a keyboard or a mouse, that we\u2019re used to not thinking, \u201cI\u2019m going to move my finger left and I\u2019m going to move my finger right.\u201d But really what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve added friction between us and operating a device: there\u2019s some intermediary that you have to use brainpower to operate; you have to use your brain to have your finger move left and right. And just think about the time that you lose there too.</p><p>But it\u2019s also unnatural. I mean, we\u2019ve learned it, so it\u2019s become more natural. But think about right now: whoever\u2019s listening can\u2019t see me, but I\u2019m moving my hands in the way that I normally do when I\u2019m expressing a thought. I\u2019m not thinking, \u201cmove my hand up or down or left or right\u201d; it\u2019s just part of how I express myself. Similarly, the idea of being able to operate a drone is you\u2019re not thinking, \u201cnow go left\u201d or \u201cnow go right\u201d: if you\u2019re looking at a screen, that is the navigation \u2014 you\u2019re just navigating, right? You\u2019re just intentionally navigating. And then the drones are an extension of your body; they\u2019re an extension of your mind that are navigating based on how you are naturally navigating through space.</p><p>And that\u2019s the difference between neural interfaces: it\u2019s meant to be a much more natural and seamless way of interacting with the world and with other objects that become extensions of our minds. Rather than the more direct connection that we have right now with our body, it\u2019s forging a connection with external technology without the kinds of intermediaries that we\u2019re used to \u2014 which, if you kind of step back and look at them, they\u2019re a little weird. It\u2019s a little weird that you move your hand around to actually try to navigate through a space. Or if you\u2019re in virtual reality, it\u2019s weird that you have to be using a joystick to move, right? You should just be able to think about moving naturally.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Totally. Yeah. That really, really helped me. I don\u2019t know if this works, but another analogy I\u2019m thinking of is that I\u2019ve now got muscle memory for my keyboard. I know that the L is on the right and the A is on the left. And not only will it remove the fact that I had to learn to type, but it, in theory, could also remove something like the fact that I\u2019m used to having to translate whatever kinds of thoughts I have that are both verbal and visual into linear sentences created on a Word doc where I edit in a certain way, and I can\u2019t backspace as quickly as I want to, or I have to switch to my mouse. It\u2019s a mix of physical hand-eye coordination and also just something like the way of thinking.</p><p><strong>Nita Farahany:</strong> Yeah. We\u2019ve learned a way of expressing ourselves through chokeholds, right? But we have become accustomed to those chokeholds, and so it\u2019s as if it\u2019s natural \u2014 and in many ways, it is for us, because that\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned. That\u2019s how we\u2019ve wired our brains. Neural interface imagines a new world where, rather than having the chokehold, you are operating more like one with the devices that you\u2019re operating, and you\u2019re operating without the chokeholds in between.</p><p>There\u2019s still going to be limitations on being able to have a full-throttled thought expressed through another medium. We have limitations of language right now of how we communicate: you can hear my words, but you can\u2019t also see the visual images in my mind that go with those words. You can\u2019t feel the feelings that I am feeling along with the words that I\u2019m saying. You can pick some of that up from the tenor of my voice or pieces like that, but you\u2019re not getting all of it.</p><p>And even when you\u2019re interacting with a swarm of drones, there\u2019s still these limitations. But I think people dream of a world in which brain-to-brain communication might enable sending across to another person a more full-throttled thought than we currently have. I don\u2019t know of any technology that does that yet. I don\u2019t know of anything that actually captures it. And part of it is, I don\u2019t think anybody has figured out how to decode those multiple layers of thought, from cognition to metacognition to the full embodiment of thought. But I think it\u2019s neat to think about that, the possibility of actually getting to that level of communication with one another.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Hacking neural interfaces</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Nita Farahany:</strong> There was a patient who was suffering from really severe depression \u2014 to the point where she described herself as being terminally ill, like she was at the end of her life \u2014 and every different kind of treatment had failed for her. Finally, she agreed with her physicians to have electrodes implanted into her brain, and those electrodes were able to trace the specific neuronal firing patterns in her brain when she was experiencing the most severe symptoms of depression. And then were able to, after tracing those, every time that you would have activation of those signals, basically interrupt those signals. So think of it like a pacemaker but for the brain: when a signal goes wrong, it would override it and put that new signal in. And that meant that she now actually has a typical range of emotions, she has been able to overcome depression, she now lives a life worth living.</p><p>That\u2019s a great story, right? That\u2019s a happy story and a happy application of this technology. But that means we\u2019re down to the point where you could trace specific neuronal firing patterns, at least with implanted electrodes, and then interrupt and disrupt those patterns. Can we do the same for other kinds of thoughts? Could it be that one day we get to the point where if you\u2019re wearing EEG headsets that also have the capacity for neurostimulation, that you could pick up specific patterns of thoughts and disrupt those specific patterns of thoughts if they\u2019re hacked? If your device is hacked, for example. Maybe.</p><p>I mean, we\u2019re now sort of imagining a science fiction world where this is happening. But that\u2019s how I would imagine it would first happen: that you could have either first very general stimulation \u2014 like I experienced at the Royal Society meeting, where suddenly I\u2019m experiencing vertigo \u2014 and somebody could hack your device. Like, I\u2019m wearing this headset for meditation, but it\u2019s hacked, and suddenly I\u2019m experiencing vertigo and I\u2019m disabled. You know, devices get hacked. We can imagine devices getting hacked \u2014 and especially ones that have neurostimulation capacity, they could be hacked either in really specific patterns or they could be hacked in ways that generally could just take a person out.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Neural data and mental privacy</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Nita Farahany:</strong> What does it mean to leave your brainwave collection on? It means multifunctional devices, right? So the primary devices that are coming are earbuds, headphones, and watches that pick up brain activity, but also let you take conference calls, listen to music, do a podcast. All of those things. And so, passively, it\u2019s collecting brainwave activity while you use it in every other way. People are used to multifunctional watches, they\u2019re used to rings, they\u2019re used to all of these devices. It is another form of quantification of brain activity.</p><p>Then what does it mean? So you do it to unlock your app on your phone. Now you\u2019re interacting with an app on your phone. How did you react to the advertisement that just popped up? Are you engaged? Is your mind wandering? Did you experience pleasure, interest, curiosity? What your actual reaction to everything is. A political message ad pops up on your phone. Did you react in disgust? Did you react in curiosity and interest?</p><p>I mean, these are all the kinds of things that can start to be picked up, and it\u2019s your reaction to both explicit content, and also subliminally primed or unconsciously primed content \u2014 all of which can be captured, right?</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Yeah, I find myself drawn to the benefits. But also, I\u2019m not the kind of person who\u2019s super privacy-oriented, and I can easily see myself being like, \u201cWho cares if they know my reaction to a song? I feel fine about that.\u201d But then I can just really easily imagine the slippery slope where the technology keeps getting better and better, and it picks up more complex thoughts. And also, I\u2019m not even correctly thinking about all the ways this data could be used. I\u2019m probably imagining these kind of benign cases, but actually there are probably 100 different uses that I\u2019m not even thinking of, and some of them might actually bother me.</p><p><strong>Nita Farahany:</strong> Some of them might be totally fine. And some people \u2014 and you\u2019re right, which is a lot of people \u2014 are not that worried about their privacy in general. So they may react to this and say, \u201cThat\u2019s fine. Maybe I\u2019m just going to get much better advertisements.\u201d And that\u2019s OK. If people choose that, if they\u2019re OK with giving up their mental privacy, that\u2019s fine. I\u2019m fine with people making choices that are informed choices, and deciding to do whatever they will do.</p><p>I would guess there is a lot more going on in your mind than you think that you want other people to know. I would just ask you: Do you ever tell a little white lie? Do you ever tell a friend that you like their couch when you walk in? Or if you have a partner, do you ever tell them that their new shirt looks great? Or like, \u201cNo, you can\u2019t tell about that giant zit on your forehead. You look terrific.\u201d</p><p>There\u2019s a lot of things that are like that. Or your instant reaction to something is disgust, but you have a higher order way of thinking about it. Or, less benignly, you harbour some biases that you\u2019re trying to work on. You realise you grew up with some ingrained societal and structural biases, and you\u2019re working on that. So your instant reaction to somebody with a different colour of skin or a different hairstyle or a different whatever \u2014 pick your bias \u2014 is one that you\u2019re not proud of and you recognise it, you sense it in yourself, because that\u2019s something you\u2019re working on. And your higher-order cognitive processing kicks in, and you think, \u201cNo, that is not me. That is not who I want to be.\u201d But your brain would reveal it, right?</p><p>Or you\u2019re figuring out your sexual orientation, you\u2019re figuring out your gender identity when you\u2019re much younger, and your reaction to advertisements or your reaction to stimuli around you gives you away well before you\u2019re ready to share that with the world. There\u2019s a lot of that. Maybe you don\u2019t have it in your life, but you might. You might have some of that in your life.</p><p>It\u2019s hard to imagine that world, is just what I would say, because we\u2019re so used to all of the rest of our private information that we in some ways intentionally express. Or like, yeah, I drove there, so you picked it up on my GPS. Or I typed that, but I intentionally typed it. There\u2019s a lot of filtering that you\u2019re doing that you\u2019re just not even fully aware of. And just imagine the filter being gone. Filter is gone: all of it can be picked up and decoded by other people. And we haven\u2019t even gotten to manipulating your brain based on what it is that people learn about you. This is just the passive decoding of information.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Will neurodata be used to convict criminals the way Fitbit data is?</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Nita Farahany:</strong> So the Fitbit cases are passive collection of data, meaning you have your Fitbit on, and it\u2019s tracking your movements and activities, and you\u2019re not consciously creating the information. And then later, the police subpoena that information and use it to confirm or to try to show that you weren\u2019t doing what you said you were doing at the time.</p><p>With brain data, it\u2019s a little bit different for the context in the UAE, which is that it\u2019s been used as a tool of interrogation. So instead of passive creation of data, a person\u2019s hauled into law enforcement, into the police station, and then they are required to put on a headset, like an EEG headset. Again, these headsets can be like earbuds or headphones, but just imagine a cap that has dry electrodes that are picking up people\u2019s brainwave activities.</p><p>Then they\u2019re shown a series of images or read a series of prompts, and the law enforcement are looking for what are called evoked response potentials; they\u2019re looking for automatic reactions in the brain. And here what they\u2019re looking for is recognition \u2014 you know, you say a terrorist name that the person shouldn\u2019t know, there\u2019s no context in which they should know it, and they recognise it; their brain shows recognition memory. Or you show them crime scene details and their brain shows recognition memory.</p><p>And in the UAE, <a href=\"https://www.thenationalnews.com/uae/courts/brain-fingerprinting-dubai-police-give-exclusive-glimpse-at-crime-fighting-technology-1.1216582\">it\u2019s been used apparently to obtain murder convictions</a> by doing this. Similar technology has been used for years in India. And there\u2019s been a really interesting set of legal challenges to the constitutionality of doing that in India, but <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/03/30/technology/police-surveillance-tech-dubai.html\">in countries around the world</a>, this technology apparently has already been used in a number of cases to obtain criminal convictions.</p><p>I have not gotten verification of this other case yet, but <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/02/24/1069116/how-your-brain-data-could-be-used-against-you/\">MIT Tech Review reported on this</a>, and I reached out to the woman who made the comment about it at a conference. Apparently a patient who suffers from epilepsy has implanted electrodes in their brain \u2014 and this is not uncommon with some conditions like this \u2014 that can either be used to control the epileptic seizures or detect them earlier, something like that.</p><p>So this person had implanted electrodes. And I say that just because the data is being captured regularly all the time: if you have implanted electrodes it\u2019s passively always collecting brain data. And the person was accused of a crime, and they sought their brain data from the company \u2014 the defendant themselves, rather than the government in this case \u2014 to try to show that they were having an epileptic seizure at the time, not that they were violently assaulting somebody. And that would be the first case of its kind, if that turns out to be true.</p><p>And really, it\u2019s just like the Fitbit data, where people would say, \u201cGoogle, provide my Fitbit data, because I want to show I was actually asleep at the time, not that I was moving around, and I couldn\u2019t have killed somebody because I was asleep at the time.\u201d Or \u201cMy pattern and alibi fits with what the data shows.\u201d The brain data is going to be a lot more compelling than the Fitbit data in those instances. And just like the person can ask for the data, so too can the government then subpoena from a third party, the person who actually operates the device, that data as well.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>How companies might use neural data in the workplace</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Nita Farahany:</strong> I wrote a couple of scenarios in the book. Most of it is grounded in \u2018here\u2019s exactly what\u2019s happening today.\u2019 But I wanted to help people understand, no matter what their frame of reference is, why it would be problematic. I wanted to try to help people who really strongly believe in freedom of contract in the workplace \u2014 so kind of the staunchest libertarian, who thinks, \u201cOK, but the market will take care of itself\u201d \u2014 understand why, in a context like this, the market can\u2019t just take care of itself.</p><p>The kind of scenario that I painted in the book for that was to imagine this: You\u2019ve got your employee who\u2019s wearing these earbuds to take their conference calls and do everything else, right? And there\u2019s asymmetry in information \u2014 that is, the employer can see what the person\u2019s brain is doing at any given time, but of course, the employee can\u2019t see what the employer\u2019s brain is doing at any given time.</p><p>So the employer calls the employee up and says, \u201cHey, I wanted to let you know that you did great last quarter, and so you\u2019re going to get a raise. I\u2019m delighted to let you know that you\u2019re going to get a 2% raise in salary.\u201d And the employee\u2019s brain data shows that they are just thrilled. Like, they\u2019re just so happy: \u201cHooray, I\u2019m getting a 2% raise!\u201d But they know better than to say, \u201cHooray!\u201d \u2014 they know that would give away their negotiating position right away \u2014 so they say, \u201cThanks so much. I was actually hoping for a bigger raise. I was really hoping for 10%.\u201d And while that\u2019s happening, they\u2019re afraid, right? And you register that in the brainwave activity. And the employer says, \u201cI\u2019m going to think about it and I\u2019ll get back to you.\u201d</p><p>And then they go and they look at the brain data and they see the person was overjoyed when they got the 2%, and they\u2019re super fearful when they offer the 10%. They have this additional asymmetry of knowledge, which really frustrates freedom of contract. It turns out the employer can easily handle the 10% \u2014 they\u2019ve got the funds: their revenue really went up last quarter, they could have easily done it \u2014 but they have this information. They come back the next day and they say, \u201cSo sorry, we can only afford 2%.\u201d And the person feels relieved, but still content, and the employer walks away having gained a significant advantage from what the brain data revealed.</p><p>And that is to just help people understand that in every conversation, your reaction to every piece of information, can suddenly be gleaned. It\u2019s not just whether you\u2019re paying attention or your mind is wandering. It is your reaction to company-level policy as it\u2019s flashed up and how you actually feel about it. It is working with other people in the company where your brain starts to synchronise with theirs \u2014 because when people are working together, you start to see brainwave synchrony between them \u2014 and maybe you guys are planning for collective action to unionise against the company, but you see a bunch of brainwaves that are synchronising in ways that they shouldn\u2019t, and you\u2019re able to triangulate that with all of the other information that you\u2019re surveilling them on, and you prevent them from doing so.</p><p>If you artfully probe a person\u2019s emotional response, you can get a lot. And I\u2019m describing brain state, because that\u2019s where we are right now. But there was a <a href=\"https://cns.utexas.edu/news/podcast/brain-activity-decoder-can-reveal-stories-peoples-minds\">really powerful study</a> that came out just a couple of months after my book was published, using much more sophisticated neurotechnology: functional magnetic resonance imaging, that can look much more deeply into the brain. The researchers had people listen to stories \u2014 podcasts, actually; not this one, but other podcasts \u2014 and then they had them imagine stories. And they trained their classifier \u2014 which is like: here\u2019s the brain image data, and here\u2019s what the person was listening to \u2014 and then they took just brain image data and said, \u201cTranslate what this person is listening to or what they\u2019re imagining.\u201d And at a really high rate of accuracy \u2014 like 80%-plus \u2014 were able to decode whole paragraphs of what a person was imagining or thinking. And that\u2019s mind reading, right? I mean, that\u2019s pretty serious mind reading.</p><p>And then they decided, we have synthetic data on functional near infrared spectroscopy, which is a more portable system rather than fMRI: can we make it work for that, too? And they found that they were able to get a really high degree of accuracy with that. They haven\u2019t done it with EEG yet, but they have a bunch of EEG data. It would require building a new classifier \u2014 because EEG is electrical activity rather than blood flow in the brain, so it\u2019s a new model \u2014 but I think they can do it. And when we start to see that data, one of the things that made that study so powerful was they were using generative AI, so they were using GPT-1. And the leap in what AI can do means a leap in what we can do for decoding the brain.</p><p>So I\u2019m describing a scenario in the workplace where the employer is just looking at broad emotional brain states. I would not be surprised if in a few years \u2014 or even less, really \u2014 what we\u2019re talking about is decoding more complex thought.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>The risks of getting really deep into someone's brain</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Nita Farahany:</strong> The more people who have brain-computer interface technology as implanted neurotechnology, the more that they need to have a better sense of \u201cWhere am I and where do I end, and where does the technology begin? And how do I understand the interrelationship between me and the technology?\u201d</p><p>I was talking to a researcher, a scientist, recently, who does a lot of work in deep brain stimulation. She was talking with me about her hearing loss and how she has started to wear hearing aids, and that that\u2019s required her to sort of reestablish her sense of self in the world, because her concept of hearing is fundamentally changed. And we were talking about that in relationship to deep brain stimulation, where she sees patients who are suffering from intractable depression, and they then have an implanted device, and it takes about a year before they start to develop a sense of, \u201cThis is me, and that\u2019s the technology, and here\u2019s where I end, and here\u2019s where the technology begins, and here\u2019s me plus technology\u201d \u2014 like this new concept of self. And I think we have to get to this place \u2014 whether it\u2019s with implanted neurotechnology, or wearable neurotechnology, or just me and my mobile device \u2014 to start to update human thinking about us in relationship to our technology and our concept of self as a relational self.</p><p>We talked earlier about hacking. We could get into the dark side of all of this. But before we even do the risks, it is: How do people understand themselves? And one thing people have worried about a lot with these technologies is a discontinuity of self. There\u2019s you, and then there\u2019s you after the implant. And maybe you after the implant is a fundamentally different person. Or maybe accidentally in the surgery, parts of the empathetic you got damaged, and suddenly you are a violent killer or something like that.</p><p>There\u2019s all those kinds of things that might emerge, but I think probably the most fundamental that people have really grappled with, is how do you get informed consent? Truly, for somebody to understand what does it mean to be a different person in relation to a technology that is implanted in your brain before and after? And how do you think about that future self and make decisions that are truly informed when you can\u2019t have any idea of what that actually is like?</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Yeah. Out of curiosity, can you take me into the dark side? What are some of those less likely, but maybe scarier risks?</p><p><strong>Nita Farahany:</strong> Yeah, I\u2019m happy to go there. Although I\u2019ll say this: I do a lot on the ethics of neurotechnology, and I am far more concerned from an ethical perspective about widescale, consumer-based neurotechnology than I am about implanted neurotechnology. And the reasons that\u2019s true are both a very different risk-benefit calculus for the people who are currently part of the population who would receive implanted neurotechnology, but also because it\u2019s happening in a really tightly regulated space as opposed to consumer technology, where there\u2019s almost no regulations and it\u2019s just the wild west.</p><p>But in the dystopian world \u2014 and with all of those caveats, which I think are really important \u2014 I think it\u2019s still possible, without really good cybersecurity measures, that there\u2019s a backdoor into the chips. That some bad actor could gain access to implanted electrodes in a person\u2019s brain. And if they\u2019re both read and write devices \u2014 not just interrupting a person\u2019s mental privacy, but have the capacity of stimulating the brain and changing how a person behaves \u2014 there\u2019s no way we would really even know that\u2019s happening, right? When something is sort of invisibly happening in a person\u2019s brain that changes their behaviour, how do you have any idea that that\u2019s happening because somebody is hacked into their device versus that\u2019s coming from their will or their intentionality?</p><p>And we have to understand people\u2019s relationship to their technology, and we have to be able to somehow observe that something has happened to this person, which would lead us to be able to investigate that something has happened to their device and somebody has gained access to it or interference with it or something like that.</p><p>You know, we\u2019re dealing with such small, tiny patient populations. It\u2019s not like the president of the United States has implanted neurotechnology, where some foreign actor is going to say it\u2019s worth it to hack into their device and turn them into the Manchurian candidate. But in the imagined sci-fi world of what could go wrong: what could go wrong if this goes to scale, and if Elon Musk really does get a brain-computer interface device into every one of our brains, is that we\u2019d have almost no idea that the person had been hacked, and that their behaviour is not their own.</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "80000_Hours"}}, {"_id": "RsLx34Q6kFT2i84Rm", "title": "AI Institution Design Hackathon (EAG Bay Area Satellite Event)", "postedAt": "2023-12-12T13:05:07.787Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This hackathon will explore near-term Transformative AI scenarios to identify and evaluate existing and possible future institutions or coordination architectures for the safe and beneficial development of transformative AI technologies.</p>\n<p>We invite leading researchers, funders, and builders in AI, social sciences, economics, mechanism design, game theory, systems thinking, and other relevant areas to prototype new institutions and coordination mechanisms for safe and positive AI futures.</p>\n<p>FORMAT:</p>\n<p>This is a two-day hackathon where participants will create prototype solutions to AI challenges, with a special focus on formats for new institutions.

I think this has some merit, but in itself not a strong enough reason (for me) not to do them more often.</p><p>At first glance, it seems that the decision of whether to run 1 or more fellowships should depend on:</p><ul><li>If you can get more people deeply engaged with your course\u2019s content (which is already a good thing if you agree with my background assumption)</li><li>while having to do less work / engaged person finishing the fellowships<ul><li>This should be possible if e.g.<ul><li>you are combining a weekly and an intensive fellowship, see the 4th point of the guide&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/10OLiCdZwrfIF69WH5rE3VC3NyoeT67OzFj_QuL9XOuE/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>here</u></a>)</li><li>or if you have some effort invested into fellowship 1, but then can mostly copy over for fellowship 2 (e.g. you have to spend time figuring out how to market effectively, but then can mostly copy over your existing method for future rounds)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>However, even if it\u2019s true that you can onboard more promising people/units of effort by running more fellowships per semester,&nbsp;<strong>you should still think carefully about the counterfactual value of your time</strong>, as even if you get some efficiency gains, you will spend a larger fraction of your time on fellowships as opposed to other activities you might pursue as a communitybuilder.</p><h2>Some personal caveats</h2><p>I also just want to highlight that while we have run 2 fellowships per semester before, it was a combination of doing a pre-semester intensive fellowship and the usual weekly fellowship, as opposed to what I&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/10OLiCdZwrfIF69WH5rE3VC3NyoeT67OzFj_QuL9XOuE/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>outline</u></a> as the ideal(?) approach of combining the weekly and intensive fellowships for sessions 5-8. That\u2019s also the version that is hardest to run, as you will have to make sure your weekly fellowship groups are on time for the intensive fellowships to join for the second half. I will make sure to update this post once we have run different iterations.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I think fellowships are great and we want more of them, as long as we are able to attract intellectually curious people.

The approach I outline may be particularly useful for those seeking to incorporate input from multiple people or groups.</p><p>Examples of those who may find it useful include:</p><ul><li>Organisations aiming to identify next year\u2019s focus areas by evaluating options against criteria like importance, alignment with organisational mission, and potential for funding.</li><li>Grant-makers with the goal of allocating funds effectively, assessing research proposals using criteria such as impact, feasibility, and alignment with funding objectives.</li><li>University students seeking to determine how to spend summer break, choosing from a variety of activities while considering criteria like enjoyment, personal growth, and cost.</li></ul><h1>Summary of the process</h1><p>Following a systematic approach to determine priorities can increase impact and transparency.&nbsp;</p><p>I consider there to be three main phases in prioritisation:</p><ol><li><strong>Define your goals, criteria, and what you intend to prioritise:&nbsp;</strong>clarify the what, why, and how of this process.</li><li><strong>Build a long list of unique options</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefu4tmsevvqy\"><sup><a href=\"#fnu4tmsevvqy\">[3]</a></sup></span><strong>:</strong> find out what all the options are, before figuring out which are the best.</li><li><strong>Prioritise the long list of unique options using criteria:&nbsp;</strong>apply predefined criteria to the long list of options to see which perform best.</li></ol><h1>Why conduct a systematic prioritisation process?</h1><p>There are two parts to this question: 1) why prioritise and 2) why use a systematic process to do it.</p><p><strong>Why prioritise things?</strong> We have limited resources (e.g., time, energy, money), and there are many endeavours that we could spend these resources on. Some of these endeavours may be better than others (e.g., they might produce more impact or make us happier). To maximise use of our scarce resources, we need to choose and pursue what\u2019s most important.</p><p><strong>Why use a systematic process to prioritise things?&nbsp;</strong>There are many ways to determine which of several options is a priority. We could rely on chance and draw numbers out of a hat. We could rely on convenience and do what\u2019s easiest. We could rely on defaults and pick what\u2019s next on the to-do list. We could rely on our desires and pursue what\u2019s most enjoyable. So why follow a systematic process?</p><ul><li><strong>It can lead to a better outcome. </strong>When we\u2019re trying to prioritise something, there are often many possible options, considerations, stakeholders, and information sources.&nbsp; If we don\u2019t think these through, we\u2019ll likely miss important information. Following a systematic process increases the likelihood that all relevant options and factors are considered, helping us make well-informed decisions.</li><li><strong>It can increase respect for, and commitment to, your selected option. </strong>Using a systematic process can make your decision-making steps clearer and more transparent to others. This can foster understanding of, respect for, and commitment to, the outcome you reach.</li></ul><h1>How to conduct a systematic prioritisation process</h1><p>Below I outline the three main phases of a prioritisation process and the steps involved, integrating a case study to help demonstrate how this could look<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxonrxti1dnh\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxonrxti1dnh\">[4]</a></sup></span>.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QtGnP2HAuQitmAyKH/jkbaj0nz6aemncltvay8\"><figcaption><i>Figure 1.&nbsp;</i>Summary of the three phases in a systematic prioritisation process.</figcaption></figure><h2>The case study: prioritising funding calls for cardiovascular disease and diabetes</h2><p>Throughout this article, I will use a project I collaborated on as a case study to illustrate the systematic prioritisation process.

This ensures that a) the priorities are based on what is most important for the user/outcome, and b) every option is assessed against the same criteria. As the criteria determine the priorities, they\u2019re important to get right.</p><p><strong><u>What do good criteria look like?</u></strong></p><p><strong>They consider the unit of prioritisation.</strong> E.g., if you\u2019re prioritising problems, you might want a criterion on the impact / size of that problem. If you\u2019re prioritising potential interventions, you might want a criterion on how feasible it is to implement that intervention.</p><p><strong>They have minimal overlap.&nbsp;</strong>If you have multiple criteria assessing similar concepts (e.g., Criterion 1 = \u2018Impact\u2019 and Criterion 2 = \u2018Importance\u2019), that concept will have a greater sway over the prioritisation results. It\u2019s better to minimise the overlap, and instead use explicit weights if some criteria are more important (see \u2018<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D-Bbjp1Y8oHqEkVd9H_jkZR-rcHcdsYb4VSr0PLxwkI/edit#heading=h.12e83w2ey0gi\"><u>Weighting criteria</u></a>\u2019).</p><p><strong>They reflect your values, and what\u2019s most important for the outcome.&nbsp;</strong>E.g., if it\u2019s important for you to identify top-priority research questions that are not being addressed by others, this suggests you should incorporate neglectedness as a criterion.</p><p><strong>There are probably 2-5 criteria.</strong> The more criteria you have, the longer and harder the assessment aspect will be. E.g., Participants will struggle if they have to assess each of the 30 options by 10 criteria.</p><p><strong>They are well defined.&nbsp;</strong>If people can interpret the criteria in different ways, you may not get consistent or useful ratings. E.g., Some people may interpret \u2018Health impacts\u2019 as referring to physical health, while others may think of mental health. Make sure you have a clear definition that reduces the interpretation required.</p><p><strong>They can be assessed.&nbsp;</strong>It should be feasible to assess the options against the criteria.

This is the \u2018long list\u2019.</p><h3>Building the long list of options</h3><p>The two main methods I\u2019ve used to build long lists are 1) getting people to contribute options (e.g., through a survey) and 2) extracting options from relevant documents or literature. Your approach might involve one or both of these methods.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Getting people to contribute options through a survey</strong></p><p>There are many ways you could get people to contribute options, from casual brainstorming sessions to more formal surveys or seminars. Your approach depends on resourcing, the desired level of formality, and your target participants. You may only want people within the team/organisation to generate options, or a broad range of experts. I\u2019ve typically used surveys to collect options from people, so I\u2019ll elaborate on that method below.</p><p>A survey might be a good option if:</p><ul><li>You want to reach a large number of people, beyond what\u2019s feasible through individual meetings;</li><li>The topic hasn\u2019t been covered much in relevant documents or literature;</li><li>You want to reduce the work required to code options in the desired format later (this can be minimised by requesting responses in a specific format in the survey);</li><li>Participants prefer to remain anonymous for any reason.</li></ul><p><i><strong>Developing the survey</strong></i></p><p>The purpose of the survey is to get participants to contribute options to your long list. At a high level, you do this by including a survey item that elucidates options in the desired format. These are some key considerations when developing the survey:</p><p><strong>Determine who you want to complete the survey.</strong> The ideal is to include all relevant groups when building the long list. Consider how you\u2019ll reach participants with different backgrounds (e.g., who work in different areas, are located in different countries, or have different life experiences).</p><p><strong>Develop the main survey item based on the unit of prioritisation.&nbsp;</strong>If your unit of prioritisation \u2013 the type of thing that you\u2019re prioritising \u2013 is problems, then the main survey item should be framed to gather problems. You also need to structure questions to elicit responses in the desired format. For example, if you desire outputs in the format, \u2018[Population] experiences [problem]\u2019, then instruct participants to provide responses like this (e.g., \u201cPlease suggest options in this format\u2026Specify both X and Y\u201d). Providing a specific format can help clarify what\u2019s required from participants, and reduce later coding efforts.</p><p><strong>Keep in mind that it\u2019s easier to filter out information than gather more.&nbsp;</strong>If you\u2019re uncertain if you want to prioritise multiple things (e.g., populations AND problems), consider asking for more detail, rather than less. You may end up deciding to only prioritise problems, but the extra detail can be included in future briefings or reports.</p><p><strong>Consider what participants need to know to ensure their responses are in scope.</strong> If you\u2019re only interested in interventions that can be completed in less than a year, or in specific countries, then provide participants with this context. E.g., \u201cWe are trying to prioritise interventions that can be actioned in a two-month period\u201d. Note that participants may struggle to judge whether something meets your requirements (e.g., they might not know which interventions can be actioned in two months). Encourage them to provide their suggestions anyway, even if unsure about relevance.</p><p><strong>Suggest a minimum number of options you want participants to contribute.&nbsp;</strong>This can encourage participants to contribute more options. Note that if you impose a maximum limit, this could make the long list less comprehensive<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmerp0ied8xb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmerp0ied8xb\">[7]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Consider what information you need to know about participants,&nbsp;</strong>such as their work area, location, or professional experience. This can help gauge your sample\u2019s representativeness. Avoid unnecessary questions that may lengthen the survey, feel intrusive, or compromise anonymity.</p><p><strong>Build momentum with participants, if useful.</strong> Determine what connection you want to have with participants or how you want them to feel (e.g., excited about potential collaborations or being involved in the next stage of the process). Consider how you can build interest (e.g., provide detail in the survey about what\u2019s next and how they can be involved).</p><p><strong>Pilot the survey.&nbsp;</strong>Check the survey makes sense to people who aren\u2019t in the project team, and that it seems likely you\u2019ll get responses in the desired format.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#c9daf8;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Case study</strong><br><i>How was the long list built?&nbsp;</i>We conducted a national survey of experts and community representatives.

Make it clear whether participants should leave once they submit the survey, or stick around if there\u2019s important information to hear at the end (e.g., what\u2019s next in the project). More questions may arise when participants start completing the survey. Consider how you want these to be handled (e.g., should people voice the questions or put them in a chat).</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Outline what\u2019s next for the project.</strong></td><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">It\u2019s good etiquette to let participants know what you\u2019ll do next with their responses. This is also an opportunity to indicate whether you\u2019d like their involvement at a later stage. Be clear about how that will happen (e.g., you\u2019ll reach out to them again).</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Note that you could combine both of the above approaches: email the survey to people and also invite them to an (optional) seminar where they can hear more about the project, ask questions, and complete the survey.</p><p><strong>Engage a third party to handle recruitment.&nbsp;</strong>Depending on resourcing and your target audience, it may be useful to have a third party handle recruitment. For example, there are companies that specialise in recruiting participants from the general population (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theoru.com/\"><u>Online Research Unit</u></a> in Australia) or experts in particular domains (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://researchaustralia.org/\"><u>Research Australia</u></a>).</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#c9daf8;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Case study</strong><br><i>How did we collect responses?&nbsp;</i>MTPConnect and Research Australia distributed the survey to approximately 500 individuals and organisations. The distribution list included Australian health and medical researchers, clinicians, health professionals, community networks, policymakers in state and national health departments, and national and international private organisations with interests in cardiovascular disease and/or diabetes. The team sent a follow-up reminder a week after the initial survey invitation and held the survey open for two weeks.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><strong>Extracting options from relevant documents or literature</strong></p><p>Instead of, or in addition to, a survey, you might extract options from relevant documents or literature.&nbsp;</p><p>In a more formal, academic process, this could involve a systematic search strategy and a rapid review. You might screen articles and extract the relevant information from those included. For example, \u201cX paper discusses how Y can be used to help this group experiencing Z, so let\u2019s add that intervention to the long list\u201d. I use a spreadsheet to extract relevant information such as author, article, prioritisation units, relevant text extract, and page number. A single article could contain multiple options, especially if it\u2019s a review paper.</p><p>In more informal settings, your search might be less systematic or focus on grey literature. For example, if you\u2019re deciding what project to pursue next, you might extract ideas from several blog posts where individuals or organisations list projects they\u2019d like to see happen.</p><p>The documents you find may also provide a framework you can use to start coding your options. E.g., You might see that in the literature, interventions are typically grouped under these ten categories. You could then update this based on the other intervention options you gather.</p><h3>Finalising the long list of options</h3><p>Once you\u2019ve created your long list of options, you need to process them to ensure they are consistent in format and are each a unique option (i.e., there are no duplicates). This involves:</p><ul><li><strong>Coding them in the same format</strong> (e.g., so they contain similar information and are at the same level of specificity). If you don\u2019t do this, you may be comparing things that aren\u2019t comparable.</li><li><strong>Removing any duplicates.</strong> It\u2019s likely there will be multiple contributions of the same options when building the long list. Duplicates can distort prioritisation outcomes by splitting votes. This can result in an option seeming like less of a priority than it actually is.</li></ul><p>To demonstrate the importance of the above steps, consider these options that could have been generated in a survey:</p><ol><li>Interventions that target blood-borne diseases.</li><li>Provide families with bed nets to prevent Malaria in sub-saharan Africa.</li></ol><p>While addressing the same topic, these options are in a very different format. Option 1 is fairly vague, and contains option 2. Option 2 specifies a specific intervention, population, and location, while Option 1 does not. To include both of these options in the prioritisation phase may be confusing and result in unhelpful outcomes (e.g., it\u2019s possible that Option 1 may be too general to be useful to you, or Option 2 may be too specific).</p><p>Coding the long list can be the most difficult part of the whole process. It\u2019s also hard to provide specific detail on how to do this without knowing the context (e.g., what you\u2019re prioritising, how formal the process is, or how many options your long list contains).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Considerations during coding</strong></p><p><strong>Determine the level of detail you want to capture.</strong> This is important for the outcome (e.g., what level of detail is too much or too little) and the process (e.g., how many options would be too many to prioritise). Ask yourself, would it be useful if I found out this option was the highest priority?</p><ul><li>Note that you could code options into multiple levels. E.g., Interventions may be coded into three levels ranging from broad (e.g., does it target the individual, environment, or systems) to specific (e.g., what is the actual intervention). This can speed up coding (e.g, you can just focus on one category at a time), and may be useful if you\u2019re not sure which level the prioritisation will occur at.</li></ul><p><strong>Consider whether the options are independent.</strong> Does it matter if some of your options contain other options (like the blood-borne diseases example above)?</p><p><strong>Make the presentation format consistent.&nbsp;</strong>To make things simpler and clearer during the prioritising stage, place options in similar formats. E.g., \u2018[Intervention] that addresses [population]\u2019. Hopefully, if you\u2019ve used something like a survey, responses should be vaguely in this format already.</p><p><strong>The coding process</strong></p><p><strong>You may start off with an initial framework</strong> (e.g., that has been used previously). This framework will develop alongside coding (e.g., there may be options that don\u2019t fit into the framework, so you adjust it)</p><p><strong>You may have two people coding the same statements</strong> for higher rigour, or one person doing a first pass with another person reviewing. If you\u2019re working in a team, it can be useful to check in with others after you\u2019ve coded an initial set, to confirm you\u2019re on the same page.</p><p><strong>You might work in Miro or Google Sheets.</strong> In Google sheets, you might have a column for the original responses, and a column for each prioritisation unit (e.g., one to code \u2018population\u2019 and one to code \u2018intervention\u2019). For each prioritisation unit, you may have multiple columns (e.g., \u2018Broad intervention\u2019, \u2018Specific intervention\u2019).</p><p>Note that some responses may be irrelevant or too vague to be coded. You could mark these as excluded.</p><p><strong>Deduplicating the long list</strong></p><p>Once you\u2019ve coded all the responses/options, make a new list where you remove duplicates. If you\u2019ve coded at multiple levels, you\u2019ll have to decide which level to deduplicate at. E.g., Do you include every unique specific intervention, or only the unique broad-level interventions? Do you care about every unique combination of population AND intervention, or just the unique populations that are mentioned? Note that you should not literally remove duplicates from the original dataset. Avoid deleting any data as it may be useful to come back to.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#c9daf8;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Case study</strong><br><i>How did we code the long list?&nbsp;</i>We conducted inductive thematic analysis to organise the unmet needs identified in the survey. The inductively derived coding framework had two levels: Level 1 codes for the body system (for example, Cardiac), and Level 2 codes for the specific body part or issue within that system (Cardiomyopathy or heart failure). Two researchers independently coded 100 unmet needs to develop an initial coding framework. The research team discussed discrepancies, then refined the coding framework. One researcher coded the remaining unmet needs for each focus area. The research team met regularly throughout the coding process to maximise consistency of the approach and to further refine the coding framework.<br><br><i>How did we deduplicate the long list?</i> Once all unmet needs had been coded, we cleaned the dataset and removed duplicates. We removed incomplete survey responses and responses that could not be interpreted as unmet needs (such as generic statements like \u2018use technology to improve diabetes management\u2019). Removal of duplicates involved combining unmet needs that were very similar, but which used different wording, into a single coded unmet need (for example, the responses \u2018Islet transplantation to address diabetic retinopathy resulting in less vision loss\u2019 and \u2018Early treatments for diabetic retinopathy to prevent progression to vision loss\u2019 were combined into the unmet need \u2018Eye, Retinopathy\u2019). This meant we gave equal weight to all unmet needs generated in subsequent prioritisation, because the final deduplicated \u2018long list\u2019 did not convey how many survey responses had mapped to each coded unmet need.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2>Phase 3: Prioritise the long list of unique options using criteria</h2><p>Now you have the long list of unique options, it\u2019s time to use the criteria you developed earlier to prioritise that list. At a high level, you want to know how each option performs according to the criteria you care about. You then calculate how well each option does overall, which allows you to order the options and determine your top priorities. Below I outline some key considerations.</p><h3>Sources of data for assessing options</h3><p>There are two main sources of data for assessing options against criteria: 1) objective data and 2) people. The choice depends on the context: whether data is available or appropriate, whether you can gather the right people, what resourcing you have etc. You could also use objective data (e.g., cost of a potential program, carbon emissions estimates for different environmental problems) to assess some criteria, and people to assess others.</p><p>If you\u2019re using people to assess some or all criteria, consider&nbsp;<i>who</i> is best placed to do this. This could include team members, experts, people who will be impacted by the outcome (e.g., users of a product or beneficiaries of an intervention), or the general public.</p><h3>Methods for assessing options</h3><p>It sounds simple to say \u2018get people to assess the options\u2019, but there are many ways you could do this (again depending on resourcing, expertise, context etc.). Below are just a couple of options.</p><p><i>Methods to assess options against criteria.</i></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QtGnP2HAuQitmAyKH/fjncrdvu4yzgxurgtizv\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QtGnP2HAuQitmAyKH/ty0vb7hway6srluwdupl 155w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QtGnP2HAuQitmAyKH/d1jps5gf0jy41vu2qi2h 235w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QtGnP2HAuQitmAyKH/cvok0ewnioxpwqd99lxw 315w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QtGnP2HAuQitmAyKH/fzbqxb56xvftk3igwgug 395w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QtGnP2HAuQitmAyKH/ydbtehvqxne1kdevxok6 475w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QtGnP2HAuQitmAyKH/wiekh2bemwwuy1bqmnmf 555w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/QtGnP2HAuQitmAyKH/ewosmlp0xe31spkme87d 635w\"></figure><h3>Using people to assess options</h3><p>If you\u2019re using people to assess the options, consider how you\u2019ll do this. In my experience, running a workshop can work well. Such an event could cover:</p><ul><li>Overview of project aims, process, and team;</li><li>The purpose of the session, ground rules, and housekeeping;</li><li>Brief participant introductions;</li><li>Questions regarding process and aims of the session;</li><li>Introduction to, and running of, prioritisation activity;</li><li>Break while project team calculates results;</li><li>Presenting top priorities against each of the criteria and overall;</li><li>Breakout rooms to discuss results;</li><li>Reporting back, next steps, and closing.</li></ul><p>As with previous steps, consider whether you want participants to be involved in future stages or decisions, and communicate accordingly.&nbsp;</p><h3>Interpreting the prioritisation results</h3><p>One important element that\u2019s listed above is discussing the prioritisation results. No matter how sophisticated your assessment process is, relying solely on the prioritised list will likely be an oversimplification. Participants can add nuance that you may want to consider when taking action. For example, they may point out that another project is already addressing the top priority, that there are issues with the coding process (e.g., \u201cX and Y should be coded as the same thing\u201d), or that particular voices were missing from the process.</p><p>Some questions to prompt discussion include:</p><ul><li>Were you surprised by the results? Why / why not?</li><li>Are you aware of any initiatives, projects, or organisations currently addressing the priorities?</li><li>How do you think we could make the most progress on these priorities?</li><li>What potential risks or challenges do you foresee in addressing these priorities?</li><li>Are there any reasons we should not pursue these priorities?</li></ul><p>Key points from the discussion could be summarised and considered, along with the prioritisation results, when determining what action to take next.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#c9daf8;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Case study</strong><br><i>What information did we use to assess options against criteria?&nbsp;</i>We conducted three roundtables with experts / community representatives to apply the six pre-specified criteria to the deduplicated long lists. Each roundtable addressed one of the three focus areas.&nbsp;<br><br><i>How did participants assess options against criteria?&nbsp;</i>We provided participants with an overview of the project and time to read the long list of unmet needs. Participants then considered each prioritisation criterion in turn, and anonymously voted for their top three unmet needs according to that criterion, using an interactive polling platform. We calculated the votes for each unmet need across all criteria (with two criteria weighted at double).<br><br><i>How did participants discuss the prioritisation results?&nbsp;</i>Participants discussed the top five overall priorities in facilitated groups. Guiding questions encouraged participants to discuss their initial reactions to the results, their knowledge of the current state of the science, and how the impact of the program funding could be maximised.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3>Take action</h3><p>Once the top priorities are identified, take action aligned with your initial goals. Consider the immediate decisions that can be made and gather any necessary additional information. Communicate the results to relevant stakeholders, including the general public, colleagues, or board members. Follow up with individuals involved in the process to express gratitude, share results, and outline next steps. Finally, take a moment to reflect on the prioritisation process \u2013 evaluate its utility, consider lessons learned, and determine if you would apply a similar approach in future decision-making endeavours.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#c9daf8;border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Case study</strong><br><i>What action was taken based on the prioritisation results and roundtable discussions?&nbsp;</i>The advisory board used the research report summarising the voting results and key discussion themes to finalise the top three priorities in each focus area.

You may end up with ten options for every one problem, because each of those specifies a different population.

If we refute their claims point by point without explaining the patterns, it\u2019s hard not to think \u201cbut they felt&nbsp;<i>bad</i>.

We agree. That\u2019s why this doc contains numerous pages of evidence to counter their unsupported claims.</p><p>And just because somebody has mental health issues doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re less worthy of compassion.

This should have been a major warning sign, but we just thought she\u2019d been unlucky. We hadn\u2019t known her long enough yet to spot the pattern and we were trusting.</p><p>These are just the ones we know of from a very shallow investigation. How many would we find if we spent 6 months investigating her? Then we contacted each of these people she accused of abuse and&nbsp;<i>only</i> shared their side? What do they think of Alice?</p><p>What would they think if they heard that she was once again accusing a former employer of oppressing her?</p><p><strong>We actually completely understand why Ben and most people believed her when she accused us of things - because we believed her too.&nbsp;</strong>Within just weeks of first arriving, she told us how:</p><ul><li>Her current employer was refusing to pay her and she\u2019d been waiting for months for payment.&nbsp;</li><li>They had \u201cunclear boundaries\u201d and were disorganized and unprofessional.&nbsp;</li><li>They promised her control of projects then reneged later.</li><li>Her previous employer was culty and unethical.&nbsp;</li><li>Her boyfriend was trying to control her by pressuring her to stop practicing the type of poly she preferred (\u201cno rules\u201d relationship anarchy)&nbsp;</li></ul><p>And we just believed her, because 1) we didn\u2019t hear the other side and 2) who lies about things like that?</p><p>Also, Alice is one of the most charming people we\u2019ve ever met. She stares deeply into your eyes and makes you feel like the most special person, like you\u2019ve been friends forever. It\u2019s so easy to believe her when she says these people have been being mean to her for no reason. She believes it herself and makes you feel protective of her.</p><p><strong>We ourselves were trying to help her get paid by her \u201cevil employer who was refusing to pay her\u201d and congratulating her for \u201cescaping from her culty ex-employer\u201d.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>And then she started accusing us of the same kinds of things.</p><p>Of course, she could be just very unlucky. But it\u2019s&nbsp;<i>very</i> rare to be&nbsp;<i>that&nbsp;</i>unlucky. If one person is a jerk to you, then that person\u2019s probably a jerk. If everybody\u2019s \u201cmysteriously mean\u201d to you for \u201cno reason\u201d - she kept saying this - maybe it\u2019s not the other people.</p><p>And anybody who knows her will notice that she appears to have endless stories of people \u201cbullying/oppressing/mistreating\u201d her, often for what seem to be strange reasons or no reason at all (e.g. she was \u201cbullied\u201d in university for \u201cbeing too happy\u201d. She almost got a kid expelled from school for this.)</p><p>Alice would randomly get texts saying \u201cYou ruined my life. I wish I had never met you.\u201d Apparently Alice had destroyed that person\u2019s marriage. She claimed to have done nothing wrong, as is her pattern.</p><p>We also wish we had never met Alice. She seems to hop from community to community leaving a trail of wreckage in her wake.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Shortly after being forced to spend a month in a mental hospital, while still in university, Alice started advertising herself as a life coach to make money.</strong> She said she stopped because she\u2019d ruined multiple peoples\u2019 lives. At least, this is what she told us.&nbsp;</p><p>It looks like she\u2019s started up again. At a recent EAG she told people that she had figured out \u201cunshakeable joy\u201d years ago and offered to teach EAs. Just before she started accusing us of things that made no sense, she was again offering to be a \u201cspiritual guru\u201d to an EA in the Bahamas. She did not follow through because she spent the next months, according to her, \u201cmentally all over the place\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>In other words, during the same time she\u2019s claiming she was miserable, subjected to the worst experience of her life, she was at the&nbsp;<i>same time</i> offering to teach EAs her secret to \u201cunshakeable joy\u201d.</p><p><strong>Many people reached out to us privately after Ben released his article who were afraid to come to our defense publicly because it\u2019s dangerous to defend a witch burning on a pyre lest ye be accused of being a witch yourself.</strong> Many EA leaders are quietly keeping their heads down since FTX, because visibility in EA has become dangerous.&nbsp;</p><p>We had to redact quotes here because, as one person said, \u201cI\u2019m worried Alice will attack me like she\u2019s attacking you.\u201d</p><h2>Alice has similarities to Kathy Forth, who, according to Scott Alexander, was \u201ca very disturbed person\u201d who, multiple people told him, \u201chad a habit of accusing men she met of sexual harassment.

Chloe\u2019s unofficial title was \u201cChloe, Fun Lord of Nonlinear, First of Her Name\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></figcaption></figure><p>Chloe\u2019s job was a lot of operations people\u2019s dream job. She got to set up everything from scratch, instead of having to work with existing sub-optimal systems. She was working on big, challenging operations puzzles that were far above the usual entry-level admin stuff that you\u2019d get as a person who just graduated from uni.&nbsp;</p><p>About 10% of the time was doing laundry, groceries, packing, and cooking - and she has to do many of those things for herself anyways! At least this is on paid time, feels high impact, and means she\u2019s not sitting in front of the computer all day. Also, everybody starts somewhere, and being in charge of setting up all of the operations for an org is a pretty great place to start, even if it does also include doing some pretty simple tasks. As a job straight out of university, this is a pretty plush job. And getting a job in EA is&nbsp;<i>hard</i>.</p><p>And she gets two hours&nbsp;<i>a day</i> of professional development. Paid! She spends the time learning things like management, lean methodology, measuring impact, etc. She gets to choose basically whatever it is she wants to learn.&nbsp;<strong>Getting paid to read whatever you want for 2 hours a day would be a dream for many EAs.</strong></p><p>Even more people would have loved Alice\u2019s job, especially entrepreneurial types. When Alice arrived, just as a friend, she was encouraged to read&nbsp;<i>a book a day</i> on entrepreneurship, to quickly skill up. She started working with us building a product that seemed likely to be very high impact. Especially since it was a project that was meant to help do decentralized, automated prioritization research, so she\u2019d be able to use the product herself to find the idea she wanted to start.&nbsp;</p><p>She had tons of freedom on strategy and she was very quickly given more responsibility. Within a few weeks of starting, she was managing an intern. She received hours of mentorship from experienced entrepreneurs every single day. She was quickly introduced to a huge percentage of all the major players in the field, to help her design the product better.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Then, within just a few months of starting, she was given nearly complete control of $240,000 - so much control that she could also choose how much she got paid! Imagine being quickly given so much financial and strategic freedom.&nbsp;</strong>As long as it falls within the scope of the department, you have control over nearly a quarter million dollars.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Whatever you want to pay yourself out of that budget, you can. If you do a good job, that $240,000 could rapidly expand to $2-3 million a year.</p><p>Especially given that there\u2019s a chance in half a year or so that you could spin out and be an entirely separate organization. Or hand it off to somebody else after gaining invaluable experience launching a really big project, all the while with the guidance and guardrails of an experienced entrepreneur.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, it\u2019s an unorthodox payment arrangement. But, man, you are certainly living a glamorous lifestyle. Always in sunny, exotic, places. Living in beautiful<i>&nbsp;</i>homes. Going on adventures in bioluminescent bays, yachting, kayaking, and snorkeling in tropical reefs. And you\u2019re living that glam life while working for a&nbsp;<i>charity</i>. Not bad.&nbsp;</p><p>And, I mean, you had been considering living at the EA Hotel, where you\u2019d be living in much less nice conditions, wouldn\u2019t see the sun for half the year, and wouldn\u2019t get nearly the exposure to experienced entrepreneurs and top people in the field. Maybe you\u2019d get a stipend of max $150 a month.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyways, for you, it\u2019s not about the money. You\u2019re an aspiring charity entrepreneur, for goodness sake! That\u2019s not a career you go into for the money. It\u2019s about the impact and the life you\u2019re living. And you want a job where you\u2019re seeing the world and doing your best to save it.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, maybe when you\u2019re older, you\u2019ll get a job that pays more and stays in one place so you can put down more roots, but right now you\u2019re young. You want to explore. You\u2019re living the dream and seeing the world.</p><p>You could maybe get a job with higher pay, though your previous jobs were ~minimum wage, and Nonlinear is paying you a lot more than that, so maybe not. But none would involve the travel. None would involve the adventure.</p><p><strong>You want to go snorkeling in tropical reefs with EA leaders but also work in Oxford and have deep conversations with your favorite EA researchers at lunch.</strong> You want to pet the cats in the Grand Bazaar in Istanbul while you\u2019re also building something really high impact. You want to be investing so much into your personal growth that you get to spend a quarter of your time just learning. You want adventure&nbsp;<i>and&nbsp;</i>impact.&nbsp;</p><p>Again - this doesn\u2019t mean everybody would like the job. However, to paint this job as \u201cinhumane\u201d or as if Alice was \u201ca fully dependent and subservient house pet\u201d - is a dark, paranoid view of the warm, positive, uplifting environment we created.</p><p>Alice was constantly given more and more responsibility. She was given more freedom than almost any EA job and then told everybody she was kept in metaphorical shackles. She made Ben (and everybody else in the community she spent the last year telling) think that she was essentially a slave, kept under the oppressive hold of a controlling and isolating group of abusers.&nbsp;</p><p>[Emerson\u2019s note: Kat paid herself $12,000 a year - half of minimum wage - for most of her charity career because she took the drowning child argument seriously. Not $1,000 a month&nbsp;<i>on top of&nbsp;</i>all-expenses-paid travel, adventures, villas, and restaurants - $1k/month&nbsp;<i>total.&nbsp; </i>In Canada\u2019s most expensive city. Sharing a single always-damp towel with her partner. Kat doesn\u2019t usually bring this up because she doesn\u2019t want to make people feel bad who won\u2019t or can\u2019t do the same, but I think it\u2019s important information about her character. Say what you will about her, but she&nbsp;<i>deeply</i> cares about altruism.]&nbsp;</p><p>But through some combination of mental illness, daily LSD use, and a society that uncritically rewards anyone claiming to be a victim, she turned financial freedom into financial servitude. She turned gratitude into manipulation.&nbsp;</p><p>Yes, Alice suffered. Chloe did too. Nobody is doubting that. The question is what&nbsp;<i>caused</i> the suffering. Because for most people, having to work for an hour on a weekend, then clearing it up with your boss and it never happening again isn\u2019t a cause for months of depression.&nbsp;</p><p>For most people, having a separate business bringing in $3,000 a month and being able to choose your own pay is financial freedom, not servitude.&nbsp;</p><p>For most people who applied to these jobs, they would be considered great jobs. And if they found out they didn\u2019t like it, they\u2019d just quit and do something else. They wouldn\u2019t demand a public lynching.</p><p>Sometimes people are depressed and see everything as bad and hostile. Sometimes people are sleep deprived, taking LSD every day, in chronic pain, and start seeing plots everywhere. Sometimes people have been struggling with mental health issues for their entire life.&nbsp;</p><p>This was not an objectively bad job that caused them psychological harm. It was a woman who kept forgetting she was an assistant and feeling outraged when asked to do her job. She felt she was overqualified and turned that resentment on her employers. It was a woman who\u2019s struggled with severe mental illness for over 90% of her life and continued to do so while she was with us.&nbsp;</p><h1>Sharing Information on Ben Pace</h1><p>Since the article was published, an alarming number of people in the community have come forward to report worrying experiences with Ben Pace, and report feeling frightened about speaking out because of what Ben might do to them.</p><p>As just one example, one woman had a deeply traumatic experience with Ben but is afraid to say anything, because he runs LessWrong and is surrounded by so many powerful people in the community who would defend him. She\u2019s worried if she comes forward that he\u2019ll use his power to hurt her career, both directly by attacking her again, or indirectly, by making sure none of her posts get onto the front page. (We\u2019ve heard multiple reports of people having a conflict with one of the Lightcone team and then suddenly, their posts just never seem to be on the front page anymore. We don\u2019t know if this is true.)&nbsp;</p><p>She asked me to not share it with Ben because she\u2019s frightened of him, but she said it was finally time to be strong and speak up now, as long as she was fully anonymized. She couldn\u2019t live with herself if she allowed another person to be hurt by Ben the way Ben hurt her. I ask you to please respect her privacy and if you know her, not bring this up unless she does.&nbsp;</p><p>She\u2019s been struggling with mental health issues since he attacked her, unable to sleep or eat. She still, after all this time, just randomly breaks down crying on sidewalks. She even considered leaving effective altruism. She no longer feels safe at Lightcone events and no longer goes to them, despite missing the many good people in the rationalist community. It\u2019s shaken her trust in the community and talking about it still makes her visibly upset.&nbsp;</p><p>She told me to not talk to Ben about it, because he takes absolutely no responsibility for the harm he\u2019s done, and has explicitly told her so. And he shows a friendly face to people, which is how he gets away with it, all the while professing simply an interest in truth. But he\u2019ll be smiling at you and friendly, all the while having the intention to stab you in the back. One source reported that \u201cBen is a wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing.\u201d</p><p>People who knew what happened to this woman confirmed that what Ben had done to her was \u201chorrifying\u201d and \u201cthey couldn\u2019t believe he would do that to a person\u201d. They were shocked at his lack of concern for her suffering and confirmed that he would probably really hurt her career if she came forward with her information.&nbsp;</p><p>She knows of at least one other person who\u2019s had really worrying experiences with him. Where deep and preventable harm was happening and he just didn\u2019t seem to care. He actually blamed the person who was being hurt! She hasn\u2019t brought it up with the person much because she doesn\u2019t want to stir up old hurts. She can tell it still hurts them, but they\u2019ve managed to move on and remember the things they really care about.&nbsp;</p><p>She had heard about what had happened to this person before, but she thought it was probably just a one-off thing and it wouldn\u2019t happen to her. She wishes she had paid more attention so she could have avoided her own traumatic experience. She\u2019s still suffering. She\u2019s still lying awake each night, replaying, over and over, the nightmare of what Ben did to her.</p><p>Another person reports \u201cI wish I had never met Ben. He hurt me more than I even thought was possible. I highly recommend not being friends with him and if you see him at a party, I would just subtly avoid him. I hope he gets better and stops doing to others what he did to me, but as far as I\u2019ve heard, he\u2019s still completely in denial about the harm he\u2019s caused and has no intention of changing.\u201d</p><p>---</p><p>This information above is true to the best of my knowledge. What other worrying things might I find if I spent months investigating like Ben did?</p><p>However, this is&nbsp;<i>completely unfair</i> to Ben. It\u2019s written in the style of a hit piece. And I believe you should not update much on Ben\u2019s character from this.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Like Ben did to us, I did basically no fact-checking.</li><li>Like Ben did to us, I assumed ill-intent.</li><li>Like Ben did to us, I unfairly framed everything using emotional language to make Ben seem maximally nefarious.&nbsp;</li><li>Like Ben did to us, I uncritically shared anonymous accusations. Since they\u2019re anonymous, Ben can\u2019t even properly defend himself, which is why courts don\u2019t accept anonymous hearsay.&nbsp;<ul><li>Ask legal history scholars what happens when courts allow anonymous hearsay: kangaroo courts and mob justice.</li></ul></li><li>Like Ben did to us, I didn\u2019t give him a proper chance to respond to these accusations before publishing them.</li><li>I mentioned none of his many very good qualities.</li><li>I interviewed none of the people who like Ben, and exclusively focused on the testimonies of a small number of people who don\u2019t like him.<ul><li>I even left out the good things these people said about Ben, like he did to us. It reads very differently when it\u2019s not just negative.</li></ul></li><li>I used culture-war optimized language (victim/oppressor) to turn people\u2019s brains off.&nbsp;</li><li>I used wording that was technically accurate but implied \u201ca lot of people are saying\u201d, like Ben did to us.</li></ul><p>I\u2019m not yet worried about these \u201cpatterns\u201d about Ben because I don\u2019t know if they&nbsp;<i>are</i> patterns. I haven\u2019t heard his side. And I refuse to pass judgment on someone without hearing their side.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, through using emotional and one-sided language, I made it sound like it was incredibly obvious that what Ben did was awful and you\u2019d be a monster to disagree. However, given what I know about these allegations, I think 35-75% of EAs would think that they\u2019re not nearly as bad as the witnesses made them out to be. The other 35-75% would think it was clearly and deeply unethical. It would depend on each allegation and how it was presented.&nbsp;</p><p>It would be a matter of debate, not a matter of public lynching.</p><p>At least, it would be if we presented it in an even-handed manner, investigating both sides, looking for disconfirming evidence, and not presuming guilt until proven innocent.</p><p>Also, in case you\u2019re worried about these people, they all say they\u2019re OK. All of the situations are either being taken care of or have ended and they\u2019re no longer suffering and do not want to pursue further actions to prevent Ben from doing it to other people.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I could do this for anybody. Just to give one example: almost everybody has had \u201cbad breakups\u201d and if you only speak to \u201cdisgruntled exes\u201d you will get a warped, distorted view of reality.</strong></p><p>I don\u2019t think Ben should even have to respond to these. It would also be a very expensive use of time, since in his follow-up post, he said he\u2019s now available for hire as an investigative journalist for $800,000 a year.&nbsp;</p><p>At that hourly rate, he spent perhaps ~$130,000 of Lightcone donors\u2019 money on this. But it\u2019s more than that. When you factor in our time, plus hundreds/thousands of comments across all the posts, it\u2019s plausible Ben\u2019s negligence cost EA millions of dollars of lost productivity. If his accusations were true, that could have potentially been a worthwhile use of time - it's just that they aren't, and so that productivity is actually destroyed. And&nbsp;<strong>crucially, it was very easy for him to have not wasted everybody\u2019s time - he just had to be willing to look at our evidence.</strong></p><p>Even if it was just $1 million, that wipes out the yearly contribution of 200 hardworking earn-to-givers who sacrificed, scrimped and saved to donate $5,000 this year.</p><p>I am reminded of this comment from the EA Forum: \u201cdigging through the threads of previous online engagements of someone to find some dirt to hopefully hurt them and their associated organizations and acquaintances is personally disgusting to me, and I really hope that we don't engage in similar sort of tactics\u2026though I don't think it's a really worry because the general level of decency from EAs at least seems to be higher than the ever lowering bar journalists set.\"&nbsp;</p><p><strong>As a community, if we normalize this, we will tear ourselves apart and drown in a tidal wave of fear and suspicion.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This is a universal weapon that can be used on&nbsp;<i>anybody</i>. What if somebody exclusively only talked to the people who didn\u2019t like&nbsp;<i>you</i>? What if they framed it in the maximally emotional and culture-war way? Have you ever accidentally made people uncomfortable? Have you ever made a social gaff? Does the idea of somebody exclusively looking for and publishing negative things about you make you feel uneasy? Terrified?&nbsp;</p><p>I actually played this game with some of my friends to see how easy it was. I tried to say only true things but in a way that made them look like villains. It was terrifyingly easy. Even for one of my oldest friends, who is one of the more universally-liked EAs, I could make him sound like a terrifying creep.</p><p><strong>I could do this for any EA org. I know of so many conflicts in EA that if somebody pulled a Ben Pace on, it would explode in a similar fashion.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>But that\u2019s not because EA orgs are filled with abuse. It\u2019s because looking exclusively for negative information is clearly bad epistemics and bad ethics (and so is not something I would do). It will consistently be biased and less likely to come to the truth than when you look for good&nbsp;<i>and&nbsp;</i>bad information and try to look for&nbsp;<i>disconfirming</i> evidence.&nbsp;</p><p>And it will consistently lead to immense suffering. Knowing that somebody in the community is deliberately looking for only negative things about you, then publishing it to your entire community? It\u2019s a suffering I wouldn\u2019t wish on anybody.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EA\u2019s high trust culture, part of what makes it great, is crumbling, and \u201csharing only negative information about X person/charity\u201d posts will destroy it.</strong></p><p><strong>----</strong></p><p>In the preceding pages and our extensive appendix we presented evidence supporting an alternative hypothesis:</p><p><strong>2 EAs are Secretly Evil Hypothesis:</strong> 2 (of 21) Nonlinear employees felt bad because while Kat/Emerson&nbsp;<i>seem</i> like kind, uplifting charity workers, behind closed doors they are ill-intentioned ne\u2019er do wells.</p><p><strong>2 EAs are Mentally Unwell Hypothesis:&nbsp;</strong>They felt bad because, sadly, they had long-term mental health issues, which&nbsp;<i>continued</i> for the 4-5 months they worked for us.&nbsp;</p><p>Below we share concluding thoughts.</p><h1>So how do we learn from this to make our community better? How can we make EA antifragile?</h1><blockquote><p>Imagine that you are a sophomore in college. It\u2019s midwinter, and you\u2019ve been feeling blue and anxious. You sit down with your new therapist and tell him how you\u2019ve been feeling lately.&nbsp;</p><p>He responds, \u201cOh, wow. People feel very anxious when they\u2019re in great danger. Do you feel very anxious sometimes?\u201d</p><p>This realization that experiencing anxiety means you are in great danger is making you very anxious right now. You say yes. The therapist answers, \u201cOh, no! Then you must be in very great danger.\u201d</p><p>You sit in silence for a moment, confused. In your past experience, therapists have helped you question your fears, not amplify them. &nbsp;</p><p>The therapist adds, \u201cHave you experienced anything really nasty or difficult in your life? Because I should also warn you that experiencing trauma makes you kind of broken, and you may be that way for the rest of your life.\u201d</p><p>He briefly looks up from his notepad. \u201cNow, since we know you are in grave danger, let\u2019s discuss how you can hide.</p><p>Jonathan Haidt, The Coddling of the American Mind</p></blockquote><p>EA is becoming this therapist.</p><p>EA since FTX has trauma. We\u2019re infected by a cancer of distrust, suspicion, and paranoia. Frequent witch burnings. Seeing ill-intent everywhere. Forbidden questions (in EA!)&nbsp; Forbidden thoughts (in EA!)</p><p><strong>We\u2019re attacking each other instead of attacking the world\u2019s problems.</strong></p><p>Anonymous accounts everywhere because it\u2019s not safe anymore, too easy to get cancelled.&nbsp;</p><p>People afraid to come to the defense of the accused witch lest they be accused (as Scott Alexander said).</p><p>High impact people and donors quietly leaving, turned off by the insularity and drama.</p><p>Well, did a bunch of predators join overnight or is it more that we have trauma?</p><p>If you were new to EA and you looked at the top posts of all time and saw it was anonymous gossip from 2 (of 21) people who worked for a tiny charity for a few months, what would you think this community values? What is its revealed preference?&nbsp;</p><p>Would that community seem healthy to you? If you weren\u2019t already part of this community, would that make you want to join?</p><p><strong>People spent hours debating whether a person in a villa in a tropical paradise got a vegan burger delivered fast enough - would you think this community cared about scope sensitivity and saving the world (like we normally do)?</strong></p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cFirst they came for one EA leader, and I did not speak out --&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>because I just wanted to focus on making AI go well.</i><br>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Then they came for another, and I did not speak out --</i></p><p><i>because surely these are just the aftershocks of FTX, it will blow over.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Then they came for another, and I still did not speak out --</i></p><p><i>because I was afraid for my reputation if they came after me.</i><br>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Then they came for me - and I have no reputation to protect anymore.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>So, what do we do? We have a choice to make:</p><p>Are we fragile - continuing to descend into a spiral of PTSD madness with regular lynchings?&nbsp;</p><p>Are we resilient - continuing to do good despite the trauma?</p><p>Or are we antifragile - can we experience post-traumatic growth and become stronger?&nbsp;</p><p>Can this be the last EA leader lynching, and the beginning of the EA community becoming&nbsp;<i>stronger</i> from what we\u2019ve learned post-FTX? If we want to do the most good, we&nbsp;<i>must</i> be antifragile.&nbsp;</p><p>Alice, Chloe, or Ben mean well and are trying to do good, so we will not demand apologies from them. We are all on the same team. We wish them the best, we hope they\u2019re happy, and we hope they learn from this.<br><br>As Tim Urban of Wait But Why said: \u201cIn a liberal democracy, the hard cudgel of physical violence isn't allowed. You can't burn villains at the stake. But you can burn their reputation and livelihood at the stake. This is the soft cudgel of social consequences.&nbsp;<strong>It only works if everyone decides to let it work. If enough people stand up for the target and push back against the smear campaign, the soft cudgel loses its impact</strong>.\u201d</p><h1>Conclusion: a story with no villains</h1><p>I wish I could think that Alice, Ben, and Chloe were villains.&nbsp;</p><p>They hurt me so much, I couldn\u2019t sleep. I cried more than any other time in my life.</p><p>My hands were shaking so badly I couldn\u2019t type responses to comments, and people attacked me for this, saying my not responding immediately was evidence I was a witch.</p><p>Alice, Ben, and Chloe show absolutely no remorse and I don\u2019t predict they\u2019re going to stop. They\u2019re in too deep now. They can\u2019t change their minds.&nbsp;</p><p>Although I certainly hope they do. If they updated I think the community would applaud them, because that takes epistemic courage similar to Geoffrey Hinton updating on AI.&nbsp;</p><p>And yet, despite all the harm they\u2019ve done to me and the community, I can see their good intentions clear as day. So why are they hurting us if they have such good intentions?&nbsp;</p><p>Most harm done by good people is either accidental or because they think they\u2019re fighting the bad guys. And they\u2019ve full-on demonized us.&nbsp;</p><p>Demonizing somebody is the best way for good people to hurt other good people. Hence them calling us \u201cpredators\u201d, going after the \u201cbright-eyed\u201d youth of the community, \u201cchewing them up and spitting them out\u201d. &nbsp;This is the language of a witch hunter, not a truthseeking rationalist.</p><p>Chloe explicitly says she can\u2019t empathize with us at all. Reflect on this.</p><p>I don\u2019t think they\u2019re villains. But they think&nbsp;<i>we&nbsp;</i>are. And you\u2019re allowed to do all sorts of things to people if they\u2019re bad.&nbsp;</p><p>And that\u2019s just what happened. Alice/Chloe had been telling everyone, Ben heard about it, and\u2026 monsters don\u2019t deserve fair trials! They\u2019ll just use their time to manipulate the system. And the two young women were afraid of retaliation!&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, they\u2019d been telling lots of people in the community their false narratives for over a year and none of their strange fears of us \u201chiring stalkers\u201d or \u201ccalling their families\u201d had happened. But that doesn\u2019t matter. You don\u2019t stop while saving a community to check and see if there\u2019s actually a witch. He\u2019s the hero saving the collective from the nefarious internal traitors who must be purged.&nbsp;</p><p>Chloe isn\u2019t a villain. She\u2019s a woman who didn\u2019t like her entry level job and wanted more money. She was a fresh graduate who felt entitled to something better. She struggled with mental health issues and blamed her feelings of worthlessness and overwhelm on Emerson and I. She took totally normal things and catastrophized them. Her story probably wouldn\u2019t have been a scandal if it weren\u2019t for our community\u2019s PTSD around FTX.&nbsp;</p><p>Alice isn\u2019t a villain. She\u2019s an incredible human being who has struggled with mental health issues her entire life, and one of the symptoms is delusions of persecution - people trying to control her. This is why we\u2019re #27 and #28 on her list of 28 people she\u2019s accused of abuse (that we know of).&nbsp;</p><p>Imagine being able to choose how much you got paid and having a whole separate income stream (unrelated to your job) and yet feeling financially controlled? Imagine seeing ill-intentions everywhere?&nbsp;</p><p>That sounds&nbsp;<i>horrible</i>. I genuinely hope she gets the help she needs.&nbsp;</p><p>And finally, we\u2019re not villains either. We paid our team what we said we\u2019d pay them. We set it up so that they socialized with more people than the average person. We valued their time so much that we paid for Chloe to spend two hours a&nbsp;<i>day</i> doing professional development. I valued Chloe\u2019s time so much that she asked me to&nbsp;<i>stop</i> sharing my gratitude as much. When Alice asked for a raise 3 months into her job, we let her choose her pay. We continue to have good experiences with the vast majority of people we work with.&nbsp;</p><p>We were not faultless. Emerson should not have snapped on that travel day and he should have apologized immediately. I should have scheduled a weekly meeting right after the conference instead of not properly talking to Alice about work stuff for three weeks, letting the misunderstanding last for so long.&nbsp;</p><p>But overall, it wasn\u2019t that the job was bad or they were mistreated. They felt oppressed for some other reason. Maybe it was that Chloe hated being an assistant and found normal assistant work demeaning. Maybe it was because Alice was microdosing LSD nearly every day, sleeping just a few hours a night, and has a lifelong pattern of seeing persecution everywhere. Maybe it\u2019s just because they\u2019ve both struggled to be happy most of their lives and continued to do so for the 4-5 months they were with us. We\u2019ll leave it to them and their loved ones to figure it out.</p><p>This combined poorly with our community being traumatized by FTX, being hyper-vigilant for another potential SBF. It also combined with poor epistemics because of the (unfounded) concern about retaliation. And it certainly didn\u2019t help that Ben had already committed to paying them $10,000 before seeing our evidence.</p><p>This was a tragedy of errors. It was a bunch of well-intentioned and fallible humans trying to do good in the world. A recipe for trouble, really.&nbsp;</p><p>And there will be other conflicts in EA.&nbsp;<strong>I know of countless EA conflicts that if somebody pulled a Ben Pace, only looking for negative information attacking one side, would explode in a similarly spectacular fashion.</strong></p><p>This doesn\u2019t mean EA is rife with abuse, it just means that EA is rife with humans</p><p>Humans with strong moral emotions and poor social skills on average. We should expect a&nbsp;<i>lot</i> of conflict.&nbsp;</p><p>We need to find a better way to deal with this. Our community has been turning on itself with increasing ferocity, and we need to find a better way to recover from FTX.&nbsp;</p><p>Let\u2019s do what EA does best: optimize dispassionately, embody scout mindset, and interpret people charitably.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Remember:</p><p>Almost nobody is evil.</p><p>Almost everything is broken.</p><p>Almost everything is fixable.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Let\u2019s fix this.&nbsp;</p><h1>If you are disturbed by what happened here, here are some ways you can help</h1><p>How do we prevent the methodology of exclusively seeking and publishing negative information, without fact checking, from becoming an acceptable norm? This methodology will predictably lead to incorrect conclusions because wild accusations will always be more viral than boring bank receipts and work contracts. Because looking for disconfirming evidence is vital for truth-seeking and scout mindset.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently, the original post is one of the most upvoted posts of all time on EA Forum and LessWrong, so now one of the first things people see about EA is a gossip column whose claims have been debunked.

You can read about the toll of malaria on this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/malaria\"><u>Our World in Data page</u></a>, and the effectiveness of bednets in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/insecticide-treated-nets\"><u>this GiveWell report</u></a>.&nbsp;</li><li>Since 2009 AMF has been featured as a GiveWell top charity.&nbsp;</li><li>Rob founded AMF in 2005. Since then, it has grown from a team of two to a team of thirteen. In 2006, they brought in $1,3 million in donations. In 2022, they brought in $120 million. AMF has received $545 million in donations to date, and has distributed 249 million bed nets.&nbsp;</li><li>Currently, AMF\u2019s team of 13 is in the middle of a nine-month period during which they are distributing, with partners, 90 million nets to protect 160 million people in six countries: Chad, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, South Sudan, Togo, Uganda, and Zambia.&nbsp;<ul><li>Rob tells me that: \u201cThese nets alone can be expected to prevent 40,000 deaths, avert 20 to 40 million cases of malaria and lead to a US$2.2 billion improvement in local economies (12x the funds applied). When people are ill they cannot farm, drive, teach \u2013 function, so the improvement in health leads to economic as well as humanitarian benefits.\"&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Impact numbers: Once all of the nets AMF has fundraised for so far have been distributed and have been given time to have their effect, AMF expects that they will have prevented 185,000 deaths, averted 100-185 million cases of malaria, and led to growth worth $6.5 billion in local economies.</li></ul><h3>Some other links to check out:</h3><ul><li>A video from GWWC telling&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fiQoARF7Rc2jrtKAc/founding-the-against-malaria-foundation-rob-mather-s-story\"><u>the story of how Rob founded AMF</u></a>.&nbsp;</li><li>Rob\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/T6Y6BzmvPMbGE7Hh9/ama-rob-mather-founder-and-ceo-of-the-against-malaria\"><u>previous Forum AMA</u></a>, four years ago.

Within the realm of ethics, there are two dominant frameworks: Utilitarianism and Deontology. When assessing the triggers of altruistic efforts, it is essential to understand both frameworks.</p><p>Utilitarianism, notably advocated by philosopher John Stuart Mill, argues that the moral worth of an action is determined by its outcomes. In the context of EA, which is predominantly built on a utilitarian foundation, the emphasis is on maximising positive outcomes for the most significant number of people. This perspective encourages individuals to strategically allocate resources to achieve the maximum amount of good possible. EA provides a guideline based on factual evidence and measurable outcomes, ensuring a thoughtful evaluation of the effectiveness of altruistic acts. However, it's essential to consider the potential positive long-term effects that incorporating a deontological perspective into this can deliver.</p><p>Deontological ethics, embedded in duty and prominently endorsed by Immanuel Kant, focuses on actions' inherent rightness or wrongness, regardless of their outcomes. In the context of EA, where positive intentions are assumed, deontological efforts manifest in more minor, more direct actions with immediate outcomes. While EA focuses on long-term results, deontological thinking can achieve immediate good. These deeds, driven by moral obligations or personal fulfilment, may inspire individuals to engage in philanthropic efforts.</p><p>It is essential to consider how acts and their directly visible effectiveness affect individuals' willingness to partake in altruistic efforts. Within the influential altruism community, there is a broad network of widely committed, well-informed individuals who comprehend the value of the process focusing on utilitarianism and the long term. These individuals consider their alternatives to do good and decide what to do based on the act with the best outcome in the long term. Even though this choice might be more effective, a large portion of the general population evaluates the extent of their altruistic efforts via the act itself rather than their eventual utility. Deontological efforts, with their potentially less significant but more direct results, appeal to individuals' intuitions and emotions. In contrast to the logical evaluation of long-term utility favoured by many within the EA community, a significant part of the populace may be more motivated by their altruistic actions' immediate, tangible, visible, and, therefore, emotionally sensible impact. People often derive satisfaction from seeing the direct results of their contributions, reinforcing that sense of personal fulfilment that accomplishing good brings, which can be powerful motivators for persisting these efforts.</p><p>The weight of this knowledge is found in the importance of a dual, nuanced approach. Such an approach is crucial in setting the effectiveness of altruistic efforts. Fitting seamlessly within the EA framework, utilitarianism guides overarching strategies to address systemic global issues by optimising resource allocation. Simultaneously, the deontological lens accentuates the importance of individual acts, addressing immediate needs, promoting a sense of community, and motivating the broader population to participate in altruistic acts.</p><p>Even though the development and advocacy of utilitarianism remain crucial in the field of altruistic efforts, modern society might benefit from a strategy incorporating deontological efforts. Focussing on the acts, playing into individuals' feelings of perpetrating altruistic acts rather than their long-term results, can increase altruistic efforts in the more general population. Combining the two perspectives can create a framework for maximising altruistic efforts and results, building a better world.</p>", "user": {"username": "SophieGroenheijde"}}, {"_id": "KW5xFqCNzqHDo92WJ", "title": "Empirical work that might shed light on scheming (Section 6 of \"Scheming AIs\")", "postedAt": "2023-12-11T16:30:58.122Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "Joe_Carlsmith"}}, {"_id": "dGmiPGeHcuZaxigvT", "title": "Ukraine War support and targeted sanctions", "postedAt": "2023-12-11T16:11:24.092Z", "htmlBody": "<p>The evolution of the support for Ukraine in the West in the last six months is probably the most terrible indictment of democracy I have observed in my life.

There were reasonable reasons to take those risks, among them, the fact that after a short and victorious Ukrainian campaign an enlarged Russia could probably become even more aggressive. But the specter of Nuclear War was more serious than ever since the final years of the Cold War, and I understood (and to some extent support) the calls for accommodation, even straightforward abandonment. &nbsp;</p><p>Those calls were ignored, the risk was accepted, the nuclear saber rattling was proven a bluff, but two years after those astronomic risks were taken, the support for Ukraine is fading for no discernible reason. In America, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://time.com/6344102/ukraine-aid-us-congress-bill-funding/\">coalition of traitors is withholding a 60 billion support package</a> (around 7% of total US defense spending,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/niallmccarthy/2019/09/12/the-annual-cost-of-the-war-in-afghanistan-since-2001-infographic/\">far less than the money spent in the most expensive year of the Afghan occupation</a>), and in Europe were treason is less widespread, stupidity is even worse:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/eu-has-plan-b-if-hungary-vetoes-50-billion-euro-aid-ukraine-2023-11-10/\">funds for Ukraine are blocked in the EU budget</a>, and put in risk by the Hungarian veto, instead of being directly channeled by the donors themselves.</p><p>I do not have anything especially original to add on this issue, but I want to make two remarks here in the EA Forum:</p><p>First, in the last two years almost all my charitable contributions have been for Ukraine. In my view, all my fellow Europeans shall consider Ukraine as their main priority. The world can live with a Russian Crimea or Donbass, but if Odessa, Kiev or the whole Ukraine fall into Russian hands, we will have to accommodate millions of refugees and the remaining Ukrainians will re-inforce Russia, that would become formidable. Ukrainian victory was never a realistic possibility, but the miracle of Ukrainian survival shall be supported by all means. I do not directly donate for military purposes (in my view private persons shall not be allowed to do that kind of contributions), but I have supported Caritas, Red Cross and even directly the Ukrainian government. I am perfectly aware that money is fungible and support for the Ukrainian population is also support for the war effort. In my view, Europe is as much a national community as Hellas was in the ancient world, and Ukraine has proven to be not only one of us, but probably it is currently the best of the European <i>poleis</i>. They are dying for our collective security, so anything we do falls short of their sacrifice.&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, I want to raise a less conventional issue: the current regime of sanctions is extremely general, and have proven somewhat unsuccessful. Of course, the true target of a sanctions regime in war time is to make imports more difficult, so when I say that sanctions have not been effective, it is not their modest effect on Russia\u2019s GDP, or in its balance of payments what concerns me. It is the fact that we do not observe a substantial contraction in the military production. I suspect that sanctions are designed by trade and economics types with a macroeconomic design. While I have not an opinion on the design of those macro sanctions, a product and firm level targeting of&nbsp;critical inputs in the machine tool space is also necessary. Kamil Galeev has two Substack blogs devoted to this issue (<a href=\"https://substack.com/@kamilkazani\">his own</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rhodus.substack.com/\">Rhodus</a>), and if any of the readers of this post has any connection to the national security policy makers in Ukraine, US or NATO circles, I suggest her to raise this issue to their consideration.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Arturo Macias"}}, {"_id": "Xo8x7fS5oA5Da4xN3", "title": "Will AI Avoid Exploitation? (Adam Bales)", "postedAt": "2023-12-13T11:37:22.262Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This paper was published as a GPI working paper in December 2023.</p><h2><strong>Introduction</strong></h2><p>Recent decades have seen rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI). Some people expect that in the coming decades, further progress will lead to the development of AI systems that are at least as cognitively capable as humans (see Zhang et al., 2022). Call such systems artificial general intelligences (AGIs). If we develop AGI then humanity will come to share the Earth with agents that are as cognitively sophisticated as we are.</p><p>Even in the abstract, this seems like a momentous event: while the analogy is imperfect, the development of AGI would have some similarity to the encountering of an intelligent alien species who intend to make the Earth their home. Less abstractly, it has been argued that AGI could have profound economic implications, impacting growth, employment and inequality (Korinek &amp; Juelfs, Forthcoming; Trammell &amp; Korinek, 2020). And it has been argued that AGI could bring with it risks, including those arising from human misuse of powerful AI systems (Brundage et al., 2018; Dafoe, 2018) and those arising more directly from the AI systems themselves (Bostrom, 2014; Carlsmith, Forthcoming).</p><p>Given the potential stakes, it would be desirable to have some sense of what AGIs will be like if we develop them. Knowing this might help us prepare for a world where such systems are present. Unfortunately, it's difficult to speculate with confidence about what hypothetical future AI systems will be like.</p><p>However, a surprisingly simple argument suggests we can make predictions about the behaviour of AGIs (this argument is inspired by Omohundro, 2007, 2008; Yudkowsky, 2019).3 According to this argument, we should expect AGIs to behave as if maximising expected utility (EU).</p><p>In rough terms, the argument claims that unless an agent decides by maximising EU it will be possible to offer them a series of trades that leads to a guaranteed loss of some valued thing (an agent that's susceptible to such trades is said to be <i>exploitable</i>). Sufficiently sophisticated systems are unlikely to be exploitable, as exploitability plausibly interferes with acting competently, and sophisticated systems are likely to act competently. So, the argument concludes, sophisticated systems are likely to be EU maximisers. I'll call this the EU <i>argument</i>.</p><p>In this paper, I'll discuss this argument in detail. In doing so, I'll have four aims. First, I'll show that the EU argument fails. Second, I'll show that reflecting on this failure is instructive: such reflection points us towards more nuanced and plausible alternative arguments. Third, the nature of these more nuanced arguments will highlight the limitations of our models of AGI, in a way that encourages us to adopt a pluralistic approach. And fourth, reflecting on such models will suggest that at least sometimes what matters is less developing a formal model of an AGI's decision-making procedure and more clarifying what sort of goals, if any, an AGI is likely to develop. So while my discussion will focus on the EU argument, I'll conclude with more general lessons about modelling AGI.</p><h3><a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/adam-bales-will-ai-avoid-exploitation/\"><strong>Read the rest of the paper</strong></a></h3>", "user": {"username": "Global Priorities Institute"}}, {"_id": "4Rh2gNFL4NPAnC6nq", "title": "Seeking input on Framework for Unconditional UBI Cost-Effectiveness Analysis", "postedAt": "2023-12-11T13:13:49.299Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This framework outlines a potential approach to building a cost-effectiveness analysis for UBI, considering direct and indirect impacts.

I was unsure whether to linkpost here but decided to do so given that it's largely based on my experiences from running EA Norway from 2018-2021!</p><hr><p><strong>As much as you can, try to underpromise when making commitments and then do your best to pleasantly surprise.</strong></p><p>Here are the two main takeaways I want you to get from this post:</p><ol><li>You have a certain amount of credits with your stakeholders, that can be spent or earned depending on whether you break or meet expectations.</li><li>As a general rule, when it comes to managing expectations with stakeholders it\u2019s better to underpromise and overdeliver.</li></ol><p>When thinking about stakeholder management, I\u2019ve found it useful to imagine my relationships with my stakeholders as consisting of some number of \u2018credits\u2019 that can be earned and spent. You earn credits by delivering on time, being helpful, and signalling certain virtues (like seeming professional, transparent, and kind). You spend credits when you break a promise, don\u2019t deliver on time, seem uncharitable, show up late, and so on.</p><p>In this context, by stakeholder I mean someone (individual, group of people, organisation, or community) that is affected by or can affect your organisation. The type of stakeholders I\u2019m most used to are users of a product, community members, funders or donors, collaborators, and contractors or companies that provide a service.&nbsp;</p><p>The value of these credits isn\u2019t always obvious. Some are pretty easy to see, like whether a funder approves your application, whether an organisation chooses to partner with you, and whether someone chooses to work with you. However, sometimes the value of having a good relationship (or a positive balance) with a stakeholder is less clear and might only become apparent later on.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Whose credits matter the most</h2><p>Some stakeholders are more important than others, and therefore more important to make sure you keep a positive credit balance with. To know which is which, there are multiple tools you can use to map out your stakeholders.&nbsp;</p><p>A common tool is Mendelow\u2019s matrix, also called the power-interest matrix. In this matrix, your stakeholders can be mapped across two axes: How much power they have over your organisation, and how much interest they have in your work.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:56.22%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hcnehXiEFoDnNjuAg/tcv07uz9w5szmbnecrmr\" alt=\"A matrix with interest on the x axis and power on the y axis. There are four boxes. On the top left is \u201cKeep satisfied, top right is \u201cManage closely\u201d, bottom left is \u201cMonitor\u201d, and bottom right is \u201cKeep informed\u201d.\"></figure><p>The idea is roughly that the more interest the stakeholders have in your work, the more time you should spend on keeping them informed. The more power they have over your organisation, the more you should ensure they\u2019re satisfied with your work. The stakeholders that are both highly interested and have a lot of power are the most important ones, and whose credits matter the most.</p><p>It\u2019s important to be aware of who your stakeholders are and how important they actually are to your organisation. If you don\u2019t, you can end up spending too much time closely managing or getting input from stakeholders who you should actually just monitor and keep track of.&nbsp;</p><p>The idea is roughly that the more interest the stakeholders have in your work, the more time you should spend on keeping them informed.

If you have the option, you should find out what they value and think is important in your relationship.&nbsp;</p><p>However, there are some general heuristics that apply to many types of stakeholders. The most important heuristic, in my view, is to underpromise and overdeliver.&nbsp;</p><p>By underpromising, I mean things like making few commitments and setting longer deadlines than you think it would take. By committing to a few things and having longer time than you think you need, you increase the chance of fulfilling those commitments and delivering on time. The next level after that is exceeding the stakeholders\u2019 expectations by providing higher quality work, doing more things than you said you would, and delivering ahead of schedule.</p><p>People who know exactly how many things they can do and how long it takes them are <i>rare</i>. Two things that make it difficult are the want to please others and seem impressive, and planning fallacy.&nbsp;</p><p>Committing to too many things, or saying yes to everything is a <a href=\"https://saidtwice.substack.com/p/bear-favours-you-might-be-doing-at\"><u>bear favour</u></a> both to you and your stakeholder. It feels like the right thing to do, and the thing that will make your stakeholder happy with you. That might be true in the short run, but not in the long run when you commit to too many things and the stakeholder stops trusting you\u2019ll do what you say you\u2019ll do. When a stakeholder no longer trusts you, it can be even harder to regain the credits you\u2019ve lost.&nbsp;</p><p>The key trait you\u2019re trying to optimise for and signal to your stakeholder is <i>reliability</i>, that you do what you say you will do, by the time you say you\u2019ll do it. It sounds simple, but it\u2019s harder than it looks. It\u2019s also very valuable in stakeholder relationships, and a trait many employers look for in their employees.</p><p>I\u2019ve found it helpful to either make it clear to myself what I want to commit to ahead of a meeting, or only commit to things after meetings in writing. To mitigate planning fallacy, I try to plan as if I\u2019ll have lower productivity than average. This requires tracking roughly how many projects or tasks I can do when I have less productive days. It\u2019s hard because I\u2019m so optimistic about what my future self can do. The saying I use to remind myself of this is \u201cI\u2019ll plan for who I was yesterday, not who I think I\u2019ll be tomorrow\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some other general heuristics when trying to earn credits with your stakeholders:</p><p><strong>The more you communicate with the stakeholder, the more opportunities you have to earn credits, but also lose them.</strong></p><p>In particular, the frequency of communication should match the stakeholders\u2019 expectations and interests. Someone who\u2019s not very interested in your organisation per Mendelow\u2019s matrix illustrated above should as a general rule not receive very frequent updates.&nbsp;</p><p>Stakeholders that have a high interest in your organisation will want frequent communication, and the more power they have over you the more important it is to make sure you communicate with care.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Uncertainty reduces your credit score.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>You earn credits by communicating clearly, you lose credits by being vague and elusive. This could mean giving your stakeholder an easy way to get an overview of what you\u2019re planning on doing, what the agreed-upon deadlines are, and how much progress you\u2019ve made. This can be as simple as just having a shared document with the agreed-upon objectives and deadlines that you update weekly, or sending regular updates that it\u2019s clear they don\u2019t need to respond to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Having your own voice makes it easier to assign credits to you.</strong></p><p>If a lot of organisations share the same stakeholders, you might need to work harder to be memorable and have your stakeholder notice you. I don\u2019t feel very experienced in this, and am sure there are a lot of useful lessons here in marketing and communications.</p><p>To start, I recommend making it explicit what your communication style is and what impression you want to make, and then identify ways to ensure you incorporate that in everything you write and say to your stakeholder.</p><p>An example from EA Norway: My assistant director and I were very deliberate in how we communicated with external parties, in particular to other national EA groups and the Centre for Effective Altruism, our main funder at the time. The impression we wanted to make was \u201cEA Norway is a professional organisation that gets things done\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>To achieve this, we did things like making sure every document we shared externally had our font and logo, sending out meeting agendas ahead of time, and making sure to note down todos from meetings and always follow up on them.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are some things I do personally:</p><p>To be more personable, I try to share more of myself in emails and particularly in meetings. When we do the obligatory \u201cHow are you?\u201d at the beginning of a meeting, instead of responding \u201cI\u2019m fine\u201d, I try to say something specific about my day or life currently, ideally something positive. To make it more concrete, here are things I\u2019ve responded to \u201cHow are you?\u201d in meetings and job interviews:</p><ul><li>\u201cGreat, I just got back from my daily walk listening to a new album by one of my favourite artists\u201d</li><li>\u201cWinter sports will finally be back this weekend, and I\u2019m getting excited to watch it!\u201d</li><li>\u201cI\u2019ve had a great start to my morning -- the sun is out and I learned that one of my favourite authors has published a new book\u201d</li></ul><p>It might feel a bit cringe and oversharing, but I find that it gives the other person hooks to hang pieces of me onto. The example responses above also make it easy for the other person to respond to what I\u2019m saying, e.g. by asking who my favourite artist or author is, or what winter sports I\u2019m watching (the answer is almost always biathlon, by the way).</p><p>Similarly, I try to be congruent in how I say things verbally and how I write. This is something I\u2019m currently practising (e.g. through writing these blog posts!). For me, this usually looks like being warm and friendly in my emails, such as saying thank you and using exclamation points.&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately, I think being more personable and thoroughly communicating in your own voice increases the chance of your stakeholder giving you the benefit of the doubt. The idea is that the closer you are to someone, the more likely it is that they\u2019ll be charitable to you. Returning to the imagery of credits, I think being more friendly and personable both earns you credits and makes it harder to lose credits with that particular stakeholder.<br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "eirine"}}, {"_id": "qFQ2b4zKiPRcKo5nn", "title": "StrongMinds (4 of 9) - Psychotherapy's impact may be shorter lived than previously estimated ", "postedAt": "2023-12-13T04:15:34.236Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>This is the fourth in a nine-post&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/sequences/zhDaftzpg6ArJQMNB\"><i><u>sequence&nbsp;</u></i></a><i>on our evaluation of StrongMinds.</i></p><p>Post 1:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/GXBvATw7Why7xRDeM/why-sogive-is-publishing-an-independent-evaluation-of\"><u>Why SoGive is publishing an independent evaluation of StrongMinds</u></a></p><p>Post 2:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/sJKgLxipgXn7TwiF5/floors-and-ceilings-frameworks-and-feelings-sogive-s-impact\"><u>Floors and Ceilings, Frameworks and Feelings: SoGive's Impact Analysis Toolkit for Evaluating StrongMinds</u></a></p><p>Post 3:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/iJX6FmohigXtNWzAp/what-s-the-effect-size-of-therapy\"><u>What's the effect size of therapy?</u></a></p><p>This post: Psychotherapy's impact may be shorter lived than previously estimated</p><h2>Executive summary</h2><ul><li>This article estimates the duration multiplier for psychotherapy.

(2013)</u></a>'s estimate that 23% of untreated depression cases remit within 3 months (suggesting 77% are still depressed at 13 weeks) does fall within the range for those samples. If we assume that the rate of remission stays roughly constant over time, and if that trend were to continue for a year, 77%^4=65%, which is actually an even better remission rate than&nbsp; 53%.&nbsp;</p><h3>Data is from high income countries, where remission could be faster</h3><p>Based on our findings in&nbsp;<i><u>What's the effect size of therapy</u></i>, we are generally of the opinion that low income countries and high income countries are similar enough for the purpose of our analysis. However, Joel McGuire was concerned that data on \"spontaneous remissions\" from high income settings would overestimate the rate of remission in low income settings, because people in high income countries have lots of options for alternative forms of care even when outside of trial settings. We think this argument may have some merit - as we have seen, participants in \"control groups\" tend to do better when they are receiving \"care as usual\" in a clinical setting. In a high income country, care as usual might consist of quite a bit of care compared to a low income country.</p><p>However, a potential counterpoint is that our data concerning rates of relapse among formerly recovered patients is&nbsp;<i>also&nbsp;</i>drawn from high income countries, so arguably this would balance out.</p><p>Another potentialy mitigating counterpoint is that our analysis on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/iJX6FmohigXtNWzAp/what-s-the-effect-size-of-therapy#We_generalise_our_findings_to_low_income_countries_and_non_western_cultures_\"><u>effect size of therapy</u></a> found that although studies in low income countries report higher effect sizes, this difference vanishes after adequately accounting for risk of bias factors. This suggests that the difference between treated patients and untreated controls is not necessarily any wider in low income countries, at least within the context of a randomised trial.</p><p>(Update: In light of this consideration, we're currently debating about whether or not to add some subjective factor to the model which rewards working on low income countries or penalizes working in high income ones, on an intuition that high income beneficiaries would be more likely to \"counterfactually\" get care otherwise. But we decided that if we do adjust for beneficiary counterfactuals, it should be considered as separate issue rather than something to be rolled into the decay model being discussed here.)</p><h2>Critiques where the model risks being too optimistic</h2><p><strong>Relapse data describes a selected population of patients who are doing better than the average treated patient:&nbsp;</strong>Effect size estimates derived from the population of treated and recovered patients who relapsed involves a population with lower scores than the average RCT participant. The point at which the average fully-recovered treated patient intersects with the average spontaneously remitting untreated patient may be much later than the point at which the average treated RCT patient (who did not fully recover) intersects with the average spontaneously remitting untreated patient. If we were to shift the relapse curve up by 1 sd (the approximate distance between remitted patients and the average treated patient) then the duration multiplier would fall to \u00d70.5, which is 81% less than \u00d70.625</p><p>However,we think the full 81% adjustment would be&nbsp;<i>too</i> pessimistic, because formerly depressed patients who did not meet the criteria for depression during the initial measurement would likely regress to the mean and become more representative of other patients during the second measurements.&nbsp;<br><br>In support of this, longitudinal data on treated patients with major depressive disorder (not limited to those who remit) from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/4640786\"><u>Wang, 2004</u></a> is similar to longitudinal data on formerly cured patients from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016503271400411X?via%3Dihub#bib57\"><u>Steinert et al (2014)</u></a> suggests that either our estimated spontaneous remission rate is too high, or that it slows down at later time points.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/4640786\"><u>Wang, 2004</u></a> interviewed a cohort at outtake, and then 2, 4, and 6 years later found that with 33%, 26%, and 21% of them remitting. This made us hopeful that patients who have once remitted regress to the mean quickly enough to be a good-enough approximation for the time course of all patients who receive treatment (including those who do not remit)</p><h2>We've modelled the benefit as decaying linearly, rather than exponentially:&nbsp;</h2><p>Because we did not have a good way to estimate the decay coefficient, we assumed linear decay that intersects at zero at the point at which remitted and relapsed patients seem to converge. It's unclear whether linear vs exponential models leans towards optimism or pessimism (playing around with the parameters suggest that \"it depends\".)</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qFQ2b4zKiPRcKo5nn/h5rnkr4njcfzjzffa8bh\"></p><p>Most naturalistic phenomena are exponential.

used by&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Psychotherapy-CEA.pdf\"><strong><u>HLI, McGuire 2021b</u></strong></a><strong>:&nbsp;</strong>The following graph is similar to the taken from HLI above, except that all the non-longitudinal studies are removed, and exponential fits are drawn on all the remaining studies to illustrate the longitudinal study trends. Direct evidence from Bolton (2003) and Bass (2006) (red), and what we understand to be HLI's estimates for Psychotherapy more generally (black) and StrongMinds in particular (blue) are shown in thicker lines.&nbsp;</p><p>If we\u2019d had more time, we would have investigated meta-regression methodology more deeply, and sought external expertise to support us. However we feel some suspicion that inadequate study design and publication bias factors may inflate results. When we initially eyeball the data, the first thing we notice is that 5 out of the 15 longitudinal studies found that the effect of the intervention&nbsp;<i>increased&nbsp;</i>as time from the intervention passed, despite involving more than 100 participants. While it's not impossible&nbsp; that the impact of psychotherapy increases after the intervention is over, we think that this is more likely a sign of methodological problems. With over a hundred participants in even the smallest study, we don't think this can be attributed to statistical luck - there is probably some sort of systematic bias in those datasets. Our guess is that those particular studies suffer from poor study design, and cannot adequately differentiate the general trend of improvement from improvement that is due to the intervention. Removing those studies doesn't necessarily influence the calculations much, but the fact that the increasing effects finding is so common speaks to general methodological concerns.&nbsp;</p><p>In our analysis of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/iJX6FmohigXtNWzAp/what-s-the-effect-size-of-therapy#Meta_Analysis___a_more_detailed_overview\"><u>effect size of therapy</u></a>, removing studies which failed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/iJX6FmohigXtNWzAp/what-s-the-effect-size-of-therapy#Cochrane_s_Risk_of_Bias_in_study_design_\"><u>Cochrane's risk of bias criteria&nbsp;</u></a>such as adequate randomization, double blinding, and intention to treat analysis reduced effect sizes from 0.73 to 0.41 after removing outliers and correcting for publication bias. If such sources of bias distort effect size&nbsp;<i>equally</i> regardless of followup time (e.g. if they inflated&nbsp;<i>both</i> the effect sizes at 5 weeks and at 40 months by 150%) the discount rate would remain un-inflated.&nbsp; However, it seems unlikely that we're lucky enough to be in the happy scenario where near-to-intervention and far-to-intervention observations are equally inflated by all forms of bias.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qFQ2b4zKiPRcKo5nn/mjc8wawzasavkftrh4jt\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qFQ2b4zKiPRcKo5nn/c54z2txstlz39orxif2l 135w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qFQ2b4zKiPRcKo5nn/shgkqvzovqfgjuwbb68y 215w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qFQ2b4zKiPRcKo5nn/nl9ygghonx8aw1tepyvj 295w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qFQ2b4zKiPRcKo5nn/p8h7k4kkrha8zgjk5i1v 375w\"></p><p>F0r example, some of the studies in this sample did not do intention to treat<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdm1s4qx3rp\"><sup><a href=\"#fndm1s4qx3rp\">[3]</a></sup></span>. Absence of intention to treat analysis in particular seems like it ought to disproportionately inflate studies with long followup, because intention to treat analysis corrects bias stemming from people who are doing worse dropping out of the intervention, and longer follow up times create more opportunities to drop out. It's also possible that studies with later followup times have different study design characteristics from studies with earlier followup times.&nbsp;</p><p>To test this concern, we decided to estimate what might happen to HLI's decay estimate when we eliminate later time points. We weren't able to get a meta-regression running to replicate HLI's result due to a lack of time, so we took the scatterplot of effect sizes and fit them to an exponential curve. This isn't strictly the correct way to do it, because points that have more data behind them should be weighted more, and we had to remove effect sizes below zero (where the intervention made things worse), but in the interest of time we're hoping it's good enough for approximation - we got 75%, similar to HLI\u2019s 71%. However, we notice that if we drop the datapoint which is the most far away in time (that's an 84 month followup from Baranov et al., 2020), it falls to 45%. After dropping the next furthest followup (a 30 month follow up by Tripathy et al. 2010, it drops to 37%. If we continue in this manner and keep dropping away the longest time intervals, we see a trend of the decay curve shrinking, whereas if longitudinal studies weren't optimistically biassed, the decay rate wouldn't reliably shrink as the furthest time points were dropped.</p><p><strong><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qFQ2b4zKiPRcKo5nn/nn3svdih5cbipyxeistd\"></strong></p><p><strong>Figure - removing later time points causes shrinking decay curves</strong>, an illustration of what happens if you only include studies with &lt;=3 months followup, &lt;-3.5 months followup, and so on.&nbsp; We see that as we include further and further data points (marked in green, red, and blue) the duration of effect curves becomes longer.</p><p><strong><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/qFQ2b4zKiPRcKo5nn/url5a9iqyarj3n18nmlv\"></strong></p><p><strong>Figure - benefits retained increases as longer followup times are added:&nbsp;</strong>Benefits retained are plotted against which time points are included. At any given point, data on the left is included while data on the right is excluded. On the far right, all time points are included, on the far left only the earliest data points are included. We see that as we include further and further data points, the supposed benefits retained rise, suggesting that the further data points are potentially more biassed. The intercept is at 0.305. Under an exponential decay model, retaining 30.5% of the benefits per year would have produced a multiplier of (0.31^5-1)/ln(0.31) = 0.84 over five years.</p><p>Of the four follow ups that were &lt;= 30 months, all of them&nbsp; caused the estimate of the retention of benefits to increase. The optimistic interpretation here is that psychotherapy genuinely has a quick decay at early time points but has lasting psychosocial outcomes. We're leaning towards a more sceptical intuition that this is at best a sign of a few studies having an outsized effect, and at worst a sign of systematically increasing sources of bias as time goes on.

We think this is a great methodology, effect sizes are a better way to conceptualise well-being improvements than remission and relapse, because remission and relapse rates do not account for sub-threshold improvements. However, in order to present our analysis in terms of effect sizes as presented in the previous sections, we had to find a way to estimate what a reported remission or relapse rate means for a given effect size. We outlined some of this methodology in our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/sJKgLxipgXn7TwiF5/floors-and-ceilings-frameworks-and-feelings-sogive-s-impact#Aggregating_effect_sizes_across_multiple_studies_\"><u>previous article</u></a>. The remaining sections will go through the particular application of the methodology step by step.</p><h3>Setting standards for remission and relapse</h3><p>Every questionnaire uses a slightly different cutoff for \"slightly depressed\" vs \"not depressed\". This cut-off typically determines depression remission and relapse criteria. In academic meta-analyses using remission and relapse, typically different papers with entirely different criteria for remission and relapse are lumped together. In order to extract information from these papers in terms of standard deviation, we need to establish where the \"typical\" cut-off is in terms of standard deviations from zero</p><p>The METAPSY database contains&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aM8ao9peYcnDwPn_yZeaUSrijqafLGRybS6zPm6rE-A/edit#gid=1548476560&amp;range=D832\"><u>62 questionnaires</u></a>, most of which were only used in one study.

In the face of an uncertain legal landscape, our community has an opportunity to come together with compassion and understanding.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Navigating Legal Complexities&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Despite a Texas judge initially granting Kate permission for an abortion, the state's highest court has temporarily halted this decision. This legal limbo not only affects Kate personally but also raises broader questions about the accessibility of medical exceptions under the state's abortion ban.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Understanding Different Perspectives</strong></p><p>&nbsp;In the altruistic spirit, let's approach this situation with an open mind, recognizing the diversity of beliefs within our community. Kate's situation highlights the delicate balance between individual autonomy and legislative decisions. It prompts us to consider the broader implications for those who may find themselves in similarly challenging circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Empathy as a Catalyst for Change</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Effective altruism encourages us to think beyond individual perspectives and consider the collective well-being of our community. Regardless of our personal beliefs, let's engage in a constructive and empathetic conversation that fosters an environment of understanding and support.

Discussions about a compromise that would extend the program for more than one year but less than five, with language stressing the existing ban on federal money directly paying for abortions, have collapsed.</p><p>Now, the best hope for re-upping the $7 billion annual program is a government spending process beset by delays and divisions and slated to drag into January and February with no guarantee of success. PEPFAR can hobble along without reauthorization unless there\u2019s a prolonged government shutdown. But its backers say that without a long-term U.S. commitment, groups fighting HIV and AIDS around the world will struggle to hire staff and launch long-term projects.</p><p>Complicating any hope for compromise is the 2024 election.</p><p>Congress passed two short-term funding patches that expire in January and February. That eliminated the possibility of the typical end-of-year omnibus bill that many on both sides of the PEPFAR fight saw as the best vehicle for its reauthorization and kicked the fight into an election year when compromise \u2014 particularly on a contentious issue like abortion \u2014 will be more challenging.<br>\u2013 <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/12/07/stalemate-on-pepfar-to-drag-into-2024-00130483\">Politico [7 Dec. 2023]</a></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The lawmakers stalling the reauthorization are seeking to impose on PEPFAR a prohibition on the disbursement of federal funding to foreign agencies and nongovernmental organizations that provide, promote, or make referrals to abortion services or give information about abortions, even if they use funding from sources other than the U.S. government to do so.</p><p>This prohibition was first introduced by President Ronald Reagan in 1984 and became known as the \u201cglobal gag rule.\u201d<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2310330#\"><strong><sup>3</sup></strong></a>&nbsp;</p><p>Its proponents are now aiming to codify the global gag rule into U.S. law.

Section 2 reviews how we assembled our database of policy-relevant MAP reduction research. Section 3 provides an overview of the findings of the six major strands of this literature. Section 4 describes our analytic methods. Section 5 meta-analyzes the assembled studies. Section 6 discusses what we know works, what we know does not work, areas where more research is needed, and promising theories and strategies that have yet to be rigorously tested.

The range of journals is similarly diverse, though&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/appetite\"><i><u>Appetite</u></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/natfood/\"><i><u>Nature Food</u></i></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/journal-of-environmental-psychology\"><i><u>Journal of Environmental Psychology</u></i></a>, <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/food-quality-and-preference\">Food Quality and Preference</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/journal/food-policy\">Food Policy</a> are popular venues. While there is no singular disciplinary home to these efforts, social psychology seems to house the plurality.&nbsp;</p><p>Broadly, the literature we\u2019ve found falls into six conceptual buckets (see section 3.1 for an overview of our search process). The first three are about direct persuasion efforts. These interventions share a presumption that people\u2019s conscious concerns have primacy in their eating choices, and thus appeal to concerns about 1)&nbsp;<strong>animal welfare</strong>, 2)&nbsp;<strong>health</strong>, and/or 3)&nbsp;<strong>environmental&nbsp;</strong>impacts and sustainability.&nbsp;</p><p>The second set of theories are about&nbsp;<i>indirect</i> persuasion efforts. These approaches share a presumption that indirect cues strongly influence our eating behavior, whether by manipulating our physical environment, incentives, or sense of self. The three constituent theories here are:</p><ol><li><strong>behavioral economics</strong> approaches (also called \u201cnudges\u201d or \u201cchoice architecture\u201d) that, for example, make meat-free choices more&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-020-0132-8\"><u>salient</u></a> or physically accessible, or increase the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1907207116\"><u>proportion of vegetarian meals sold in cafeterias</u></a>;</li><li><strong>economic</strong> interventions which manipulate incentives, for instance by making meat more expensive or meat alternatives less expensive;</li><li><strong>psychological</strong> interventions which typically appeal to (and sometimes manipulate) people\u2019s sense of norms.</li></ol><p>Some studies combined multiple theories of change, e.g. presented information about both the health and environmental reasons for eating less meat (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s43016-023-00712-1\"><u>Jalil et al. 2023</u></a>) or an appeal to psychological norms alongside a visual ranking of meal choices by their environmental impacts (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2020.104842\"><u>Piester et al. 2020</u></a>).</p><p>We now review each strand in turn.</p><h3>3.1 Appeals to animal welfare</h3><p>Direct appeals to eat less meat for the sake of animals\u2019 wellbeing inform 13 of 42 interventions in our database. These interventions take many forms. Some studies, often run by animal advocacy organizations such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/faunalytics\"><u>Faunalytics</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/the-humane-league\"><u>The Humane League</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/mercy-for-animals\"><u>Mercy for Animals</u></a>, distribute&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195666322000721?via%3Dihub\"><u>pamphlets</u></a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://osf.io/nwcgf\"><u>booklets</u></a> on animal welfare issues.

However, as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666321001847\"><u>Mathur et al. (2021 b)</u></a> note, social desirability bias in this literature is likely \u201cwidespread.\u201d The typical study in this literature tries to persuade people that eating meat is morally unacceptable, often by confronting them with upsetting footage from factory farms, and then asks them a few weeks later how much meat they ate in the past week.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.elgaronline.com/display/edcoll/9781788110556/9781788110556.00031.xml\"><u>Experimenter demand effects</u></a> are likely.</p><p>Two studies in this strand meet our inclusion criteria and<i>&nbsp;</i>also measure outcomes unobtrusively. The first is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.668674/full\"><u>Haile et al. (2021)</u></a>, who distributed pro-vegan pamphlets on a college campus, tracked what students ate at their dining halls and find that \u201cthe pamphlet had no statistically significant long-term aggregate effects.\u201d The second is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3938994\"><u>Epperson and Gerster (2021)</u></a>, which shows that a \u201c360\u00b0 video about the living conditions of pigs in intensive farming via a virtual reality (VR) headset\u201d led to a 6-9% reduction in purchased meals that contained meat in university canteens.&nbsp;</p><h3>3.2 Appeals to health</h3><p>Health concerns motivate 9 of 42 interventions in our database. These studies are often conducted and/or written by medical doctors. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aacrjournals.org/cebp/article/14/6/1453/258325/Project-PREVENT-A-Randomized-Trial-to-Reduce\"><u>Emmons et al. (2005 a)</u></a> assigned individuals who had received a \u201cdiagnosis of adenomatous colorectal polyps\u201d (which are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/diseases-conditions/colorectal-polyps\"><u>potentially precancerous</u></a>) to either a usual care condition or a tailored intervention that provided counseling and materials on risk factors for colorectal cancer, \u201cincluding red meat consumption, fruit and vegetable intake, multivitamin intake, alcohol, smoking, and physical inactivity.\u201d The outcome variable was self-reported servings of red meat per week measured at an 8-month follow-up, which the authors dichotomized into \u201cmore than three servings per week of red meat\u201d or not. Overall, there was an 18% reduction in this outcome for the treatment group and a 12% reduction for the usual care condition.</p><p>One challenge to integrating these results into our database is that they often focus on red meat and/or processed meat consumption rather than MAP as a whole. There is a risk, therefore, that these interventions might induce substitution towards other animal-based products.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2017.01.006\"><u>Kl\u00f6ckner &amp; Ofstad (2017)</u></a>, for example, recommended that subjects \u201csubstitute beef with other meats or fish,\u201d which are arguably worse for animal welfare on a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/23/vegetarianism-for-meat-eaters/\"><u>per-ounce-of-meat</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22430749/beef-chicken-climate-diet-vegetarian\"><u>basis</u></a><u> (see </u><a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abo2535\"><u>Mathur 2022</u></a><u> for further discussion).</u> We did not include this study in our meta-analytic database because we cannot clearly deduce its overall effect on MAP consumption. However, we included all red and/or processed meat consumption studies that did not specifically argue for switching to other MAP products. (See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5e90e46fd1119766887d1dc3/t/646cc4f6d0b87674aa83a548/1684849910918/FishNormsInterventionBrief.pdf\"><u>Matt-Navarro and Sparkman (forthcoming)</u></a> for research targeting fish consumption.)</p><h3>3.3 Appeals to the environment</h3><p>These studies focus on the environmental harms of consuming animal products and/or promote plant-based alternatives as a more sustainable option. This framing informs 9 of 42 interventions in our database. Environmental arguments are communicated in a plethora of ways, including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/158315429.pdf\"><u>leaflets</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2020.104842\"><u>signs in college cafeterias</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2021.101592\"><u>op-eds</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2021.101592\"><u>daily reminder text messages</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-2047134/v1_covered.pdf?c=1665164513\"><u>in-class lectures</u></a>.</p><p>The landmark study in this branch of the literature is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s43016-023-00712-1\"><u>Jalil et al. (2023)</u></a>, who randomly assigned undergraduate classes to hear a \u201c50 min talk about the role of meat consumption in global warming, along with information about the health benefits of reduced meat consumption,\u201d and then measured their subsequent food choices at the college\u2019s dining facilities. Overall, they find that students in the treatment group \u201creduced their meat consumption by 5.6 percentage points with no signs of reversal over 3 years.\u201d No other study in this literature shows well-identified effects enduring this long.</p><h3>3.4 Behavioral economics: nudges and choice architecture</h3><p>Behavioral economics/<a href=\"https://thedecisionlab.com/reference-guide/psychology/choice-architecture\"><u>choice architecture</u></a> interventions focus on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://yalebooks.yale.edu/book/9780300262285/nudge/\"><u>nudging</u></a> people into unconsciously or semi-consciously choosing meat-free meals. For example, these studies might alter how&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950329315300227?via%3Dihub\"><u>fruits and vegetables are presented at a buffet</u></a>; how&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2016.07.009\"><u>slaughtered animals are presented</u></a> on a hypothetical menu; or whether a meat or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/bpp.2019.11\"><u>vegetarian meal is the default at a restaurant</u></a> (the alternative was presented as \u201cavailable on request\u201d). This strand comprises five interventions and two studies in our database, both with<a href=\"https://www.phc.ox.ac.uk/team/emma-garnett\"><u> Emma Garnett</u></a> as first author. These studies found that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1907207116\"><u>doubling the percentage of vegetarian meals available</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s43016-020-0132-8\"><u>putting a vegetarian meal closer to the entrance</u></a> in university cafeterias generally increase sales of vegetarian meals.</p><p>This literature features some creative interventions that target realistic theories of change but also some startling design limitations. The most concerning is the use of hypothetical outcomes. For instance,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0013916512469099\"><u>Campbell-Arvai, Arvai, and Kalof (2017)</u></a> intercepted college students on their way to a dining hall \u201cunder the pretence of completing a survey about their food preferences,\u201d then led them \u201cto a small conference room\u201d where they were presented with different configurations of menus whose items were selected from options at the dining hall. Students told researchers which food they preferred and then left to go eat their meal, which the researchers did not track. As the authors themselves put it, this design might \u201cbe critiqued for not providing actual food choices and thus lacking any real consequences.\u201d Along the same lines,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195666317309480?via%3Dihub\"><u>Bacon and Krpap (2018)</u></a> asked MTurk participants to \u201cimagine a scenario in which they were catching up with a friend for dinner in a nice restaurant one evening during the week\u2026they were also presented with an image of a cozy table in a restaurant.\u201d The main outcome was probability of selecting a vegetarian option from a hypothetical menu.</p><p>Second, some of these studies feature a large number of subjects but assign treatment at the level of a restaurant or dining hall and include too few units for meaningful analysis.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07448481.2012.755189\"><u>McClain et al. 2013</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ijbnpa.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12966-017-0496-9\"><u>Reinders et al. 2017</u></a>, for instance, test plausible theories of change in a college cafeteria and a chain of restaurants, respectively, but had just 2 and 3 units in their respective treatment arms. Both studies did not meet our inclusion criteria but offer plausible theories and promising designs for future replications. Another very nice study (<a href=\"https://10.1016/j.appet.2023.106767\">Berke and Larson 2023</a>) randomly assigns folks who are attending an MIT Media lab event, which serves free food, to see either a menu with vegan/vegetarian labels or no labels (all meals were vegetarian or vegan); the authors find that labels significantly decrease the proportion of vegan meals selected. We did not include this study because it lacks delayed outcomes, but we find its underlying theory very plausible.&nbsp;</p><p>See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30177007/\"><u>Bianchi (2018 b)</u></a> for a thorough review of choice architecture interventions.</p><h3>3.5 Conventional economics: price manipulations</h3><p>Economic manipulations seek to alter the explicit incentives behind MAP consumption. This is an underdeveloped body of research, informing just 1 of 42 interventions in our database. That study (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/ajcn/nqab414\"><u>BIanchi 2022</u></a>) provides free meat-free substitutes to participants, along with \u201cinformation leaflets about the health and environmental benefits of eating less meat,\u201d recipes, and success stories from people who reduced their meat consumption. Four weeks after the intervention concluded, treated subjects reported that they ate an average of 38 grams less meat per day than those in the control group (about 11 oz per week).</p><p>Two studies in this field presented interesting, plausible theories of change but had design limitations that led us to exclude them from our meta-analysis. First,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckp092\"><u>Vermeer et al. (2010)</u></a> surveyed people at a fast food restaurant and contrasted two pricing schemes, one where larger sizes were cheaper on a per-ounce basis and one where price-per-ounce was held constant. They found no effect on consumers\u2019&nbsp;<i>intended</i> portion size purchases, but the real prices were not altered and no real food purchases were measured. As the authors note, \u201c[m]ore research in realistic settings with actual behaviour as outcome measure is required.\u201d Second,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272494421000426?via%3Dihub\"><u>Garnett et al. (2021)</u></a> introduced a small price change at a \u201ccollege cafeteria in the University of Cambridge (UK), introducing a small change to the price of vegetarian meals (decreased by 20p from \u00a32.05 to \u00a31.85) and meat meals (increased by 20p from \u00a32.52 to \u00a32.72).\u201d The intervention had no main effect on meat sales but increased sales of vegetarian meals by 3.2%. However, treatment and control had just one cluster apiece. This study is an excellent candidate for replication.</p><h3>3.6 Psychological appeals</h3><p>MAP reduction studies drawing on social psychological theories comprise 14 of 42 interventions in our database. These studies typically try to&nbsp;<i>normalize</i> vegetarianism and veganism by creating a perception that eating plant-based meals is consistent with social norms. To do this, researchers might put up signs that say things like \u201c<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2021.105824\"><u>More and more [retail store name] customers are choosing our veggie options</u></a>,\u201d or \u201c<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2020.104842\"><u>The garden fresh veggie burger is a tasty choice</u></a>!\u201d One study told participants that people who eat meat are more likely to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S019566630190474X\"><u>endorse social hierarchy and embrace human dominance over nature</u></a>, thus making them out to be a counter-normative outgroup.</p><p>Other studies conducted drawing on social psychological theories include an app that monitors people\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666321006334?via%3Dihub#sec2\"><u>meat-free pledges on their phones</u></a>, or a combination of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2020.103997\"><u>norm-setting and messaging seeking to promote self-efficacy and the perceived feasibility</u></a> of eating less meat.</p><p>A strong study in this category is <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797617719950\">Sparkman and Walton (2017)</a>, who presented people waiting in line at a Stanford cafeteria the opportunity to participate in a 'survey' in exchange for a meal coupon, where the survey presented one of two norms-based messages: a 'static' message about how \"30% of Americans make an effort to limit their meat consumption,\" or a <i>dynamic</i> message emphasizing how behavior is changing over time and that vegetarianism is taking off among participants' peers. The authors find that 17% of participants in the static group ordered a meatless lunch vs. 23% in the control group and 34% in the dynamic norm group.</p><p>For an overview of psychological theories of vegetarianism, see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195666318309309\"><u>Rosenfeld (2018)</u></a>.</p><h2>4 Meta-analytic methods</h2><p>For primers on reading and writing meta-analyses, see Frank et al. 2023,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://experimentology.io/016-meta.html\"><u>chapter 16</u></a>, or Lakens 2022,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lakens.github.io/statistical_inferences/11-meta.html\"><u>chapter 11</u></a>.</p><h3>4.1 Coding the database</h3><p>Condensing an intervention to an estimate of average treatment effect and associated variance sometimes involves judgment calls. Here are the general guidelines we followed:</p><ol><li>We take the outcome that most clearly maps to changes in actual consumption behavior.&nbsp;</li><li>We take the latest possible outcome to test for the presence of enduring effects, and our sample sizes are taken from the same measurement wave.</li><li>For cluster-assigned treatments, our Ns are the number of clusters rather than participants. This includes studies that cluster by day (e.g. everyone who comes to a restaurant on some day gets treated).</li><li>We convert all effect sizes to estimates of standardized mean differences: Average Treatment Effect (ATE) / standard deviation (SD).</li><li>When possible, we calculate ATE using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://edge.edx.org/assets/courseware/v1/b8d2a8030b7aa5f2762a464bf7f8b0c7/c4x/BerkeleyX/CEGA101AIE/asset/Module_2.5_Difference_in_Differences.pdf\"><u>difference in differences</u></a>&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"((T_{T2} - T_{T1}) - (C_{T2} -C_{T1}))\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mo\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-main-R\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em;

Our code mainly uses functions from the&nbsp;<code>metafor</code> and&nbsp;<code>tidyverse</code> packages in R as well as some custom wrappers that Seth wrote for previous meta-analyses.</p><p>The coefficients we report are:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Glass\u2019s Delta (\u2206), which indicates a meta-analytic estimate: a weighted average of many point estimates, where larger, more precisely estimated studies influence the average proportionally more than smaller ones.</li><li>Beta (\u03b2), a regression coefficient. Linear regression tells you E(Y | X), i.e. for some value of X (or many Xs), the expected value of Y. We report this coefficient when we discuss publication bias or the effects associated with covariates.&nbsp;</li><li>SE (standard error) is the standard deviation of the sampling distribution, e.g. \u2206 or \u03b2. Smaller standard errors mean more precise estimates.</li><li>P-value, a measure of statistical significance.

Sections 5.2-5.8 are our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://osf.io/3sth2\"><u>pre-registered analyses</u></a> reported in the order we originally intended. Sections 5.9 and 5.10 are exploratory analyses we came up with after writing our pre-analysis plan.</p><h3>5.1 Descriptive overview of the database</h3><p>Our database comprises 28 papers that detail 42 interventions. For interventions with assignment at the level of the individual, the average sample size is 427 participants, and the average cluster-assigned intervention has 64 clusters (the equivalent median numbers are 214 and 54, respectively).&nbsp;</p><p>Twenty-seven interventions take place exclusively in the United States \u2014 20 in person and 7 online with US participants. An additional seven take place in the United Kingdom and three take place in Italy. Australia, Germany, and Canada have one intervention each, while one multisite intervention takes place in the UK, Germany, and, Australia, and one intervention recruits internet participants in the US, UK, Canada, Australia, and \u201cother.\u201d</p><p>Twenty-six interventions take place at colleges or universities, while twelve look at adults (18+), and one specifically looks at older adults (40+). One intervention looks at people of all ages (including children), while&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mercyforanimals.org/blog/impact-study/\"><u>one</u></a> looks at women ages 13-25. Sixteen interventions take place on a US college campus.</p><p>23 of 42 outcomes are self-reported. These range in granularity from reporting whether subjects had \u2264 3 servings of red meat in a given week (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2004.038745\"><u>Sorensen et al. 2005</u></a>) to food questionnaires asking participants to recall everything they recently ate, e.g. in the past 24 hours (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0195666322000721?via%3Dihub\"><u>Feltz et al. 2022</u></a>) or the past week (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34960107/\"><u>Mathur et al. 2021 a</u></a>).</p><p>The 19 outcomes that are not self-reported are typically recorded at a restaurant or college dining hall.

First, as noted before, half of the interventions in our dataset yield null or negative results, which suggests that insignificant and null findings in this literature are able to see the light of day. Second, the relationship between standard error and effect size is small and insignificant: \u03b2 = -0.0236 (SE = 0.292). (This essentially means that smaller, noisier studies have not been contradicted by larger, better-powered results.)</p><p>We do, however, find a moderate though statistically insignificant relationship between a paper\u2019s having a DOI (digital object identifier), which generally means that it has been published in an academic journal, and effect size: \u03b2 = 0.11382 (SE = 0.07635). In our dataset, the thirty interventions from papers with a DOI have an meta-analytic effect of \u2206 = 0.175 (SE = 0.041), p = 0.0002 while the ten studies without a DOI have a meta-analytic effect of \u2206 = 0.038 (SE = 0.012), p = 0.009. This might suggest that a study needs to have positive results to be published in a peer-reviewed journal. However, we don\u2019t read too much into this, because many of the studies without DOIs are published by vegan advocacy organizations such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/faunalytics\"><u>Faunalytics</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/the-humane-league\"><u>The Humane League</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=mercy+for+animals+effective+altruism+forum&amp;oq=mercy+for+animals+effective+altruism+forum&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIHCAEQIRigAdIBCDcxNDRqMGoxqAIAsAIA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8\"><u>Mercy for Animals</u></a>, which, to their credit, publicize their null results, and sometimes critically re-examine their own findings.</p><h3>5.4 Differences by assignment, theory and self-report</h3><p><strong>5.4.1 Cluster-assigned interventions show smaller effects on average</strong></p><p>The 14 interventions where treatment is cluster-assigned show much smaller effects on average: \u2206 = 0.036 (SE = 0.025), p = 0.181, versus \u2206 = 0.57 (SE = 0.037), p = 0.0002 for the 28 interventions where treatment was assigned at the level of the individual.</p><p><strong>5.4.2 There are large differences in efficacy between theoretical approaches</strong></p><p>Table 2 presents, for each of the six theoretical approaches outlined in section 3, the number of constituent interventions, the average meta-analytic effect, the standard error of that estimate, and stars corresponding to that estimate\u2019s statistical significance.

In other words, in-person interventions are about 3.45 times more effective than those administered online; but if an online intervention could reach four people for the price it would take to reach one in person, then online distribution might be more cost-effective. Nevertheless, \u2206 = 0.048 is so small that we think this line of work is not fruitful.</p><h3>5.7 Any relationship between delay and outcome?</h3><p>Days of delay between treatment and measurement has essentially zero relationship with effect size: \u03b2 = -0.00002.</p><h3>5.8 What about publication date?&nbsp;</h3><p>Effect sizes seem to be getting smaller every decade.

However, we don\u2019t read much into this because of the small Ns for the non-US categories.</p><h2>6 Discussion</h2><p>Overall, we\u2019re optimistic about the state of MAP reduction research.&nbsp;</p><p>On the one hand, we need more credible empirical work. With just 28 papers and 42 interventions meeting pretty minimal quality standards, nothing in our analysis should be considered especially well-validated. On the other hand, recent MAP reduction papers tend to bring careful, design-based approaches to the problems of measurement validity, social desirability bias, and verisimilitude. The trend, therefore, is towards increasingly credible work. However, even the best of these studies would benefit from out-of-sample replication to help us understand&nbsp;<i>where&nbsp;</i>and for&nbsp;<i>whom</i> the most promising interventions work.&nbsp;</p><h3>6.1 What works to reduce MAP consumption?</h3><p>In general, appeals to health and the environment appear to reduce MAP consumption, albeit not by very large amounts. Moreover, we have a lot more confidence that these appeals work for college students than for the general population because of the results from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s43016-023-00712-1\"><u>Jalil et al. (2023)</u></a>. Still, we can only learn so much from one experiment at one college. We recommend replication and extension.</p><h3>6.2 What doesn\u2019t work to reduce MAP consumption?</h3><p>Our review suggests that leafleting studies, studies administered online, appeals to animal welfare, and choice architecture/nudging studies generally do not move the needle on reducing MAP consumption.&nbsp;</p><p>We are disappointed by the lack of efficacy of appeals to animal welfare. We want people to care about animals and their needs for their own sake, not just whether eating them is good or bad for&nbsp;<i>our</i> health and welfare. It seems we have our work cut out for us in making that message persuasive.</p><p>We also wish to caveat that many of the most interesting choice architecture interventions did not meet our inclusion criteria, but well-powered, randomly assigned versions of those interventions could be worth pursuing, e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/10.1086/720450\"><u>Malan et al.

It seems backwards that there have been many more&nbsp;<i>behavioral&nbsp;</i>economics studies on MAP consumption than well-identified economics studies. (See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&amp;type=pdf&amp;doi=e77e92ad9f1d6d0495b57107ba0a630c2a290f80\"><u>here</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-47166-8_8\"><u>here</u></a> for observational work on the subject).<ol><li>A great starting point would be to replicate&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0272494421000426\"><u>Garnett et al.

I argued from the pro-capitalist position, relying on an abstract view of economic systems, they argued from an anti-capitalist position, motivated by concerns about concrete problems like economic inequality, and we ended up talking past each other.</p><h1>Not all socialists are socialist</h1><p>This semantic underdetermination (or, in simpler terms, vagueness) isn\u2019t just relevant to laypeople. For example, the leftist economist Thomas Piketty advocates a series of reforms, including a steep wealth tax that would prohibit dynastic wealth, that he bundles under the name <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/07/podcasts/transcript-ezra-klein-interviews-thomas-piketty.html\">\u201cparticipatory socialism\u201d</a>. None of these reforms is to abolish capital markets (or markets in goods and services).</p><p>Some political parties, such as France\u2019s <i>Parti socialiste</i>, use the term \u201csocialism\u201d interchangeably with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_democracy\">\u201csocial democracy\u201d</a>, which is a reformist school of thought that does not call for the abolition of capital markets. Other political parties, like Norway\u2019s <i>Sosialistisk Venstreparti</i>, seem to prevaricate between social democracy and revolutionary socialism or Marxism.</p><p>This helps explain why a <a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/09/19/modest-declines-in-positive-views-of-socialism-and-capitalism-in-u-s/\">Pew Research survey</a> found that 44% of Americans aged 18-29 had a positive view of socialism, while only 40% had a positive view of capitalism. Among Democrats in the same age bracket, 58% had a positive view of socialism versus 29% for capitalism. I doubt that Marxism-Leninism is that popular in America. These people more likely have in mind the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nordic_model\">Nordic model</a> than the Soviet Union.&nbsp;</p><h1>The economics of the long-term future</h1><p>Supposing superhuman AGI is invented this century or, alternatively, radical human brain upgrades become possible,&nbsp;economic growth will presumably accelerate and the productivity and automation of labour will presumably increase dramatically. In this scenario, it\u2019s not clear if the already tenuous \u201ccapitalism\u201d/\u201csocialism\u201d distinction will hold. Particularly if policies like universal basic income and <a href=\"https://www.lemonde.fr/blog/piketty/2021/05/18/from-basic-income-to-inheritance-for-all/\">universal basic inheritance</a> are enacted, it\u2019s unclear if we will still recognize the <i>gestalt</i> of capitalism or socialism.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aF9HcoaFLmXGQijx7/hbqw9dppjpgthkeokp32\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aF9HcoaFLmXGQijx7/g0myc3p9bhjbmatk2u5r 200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aF9HcoaFLmXGQijx7/sfiz99i41btvhmpp88cb 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aF9HcoaFLmXGQijx7/xn9or3ab4jrjhxcjlzgq 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aF9HcoaFLmXGQijx7/sxvnohhtopj6eoork2gk 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aF9HcoaFLmXGQijx7/kelebnzmot8pmgd8m0dt 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aF9HcoaFLmXGQijx7/g5elvcb4ujz5vvqvxifw 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aF9HcoaFLmXGQijx7/umwt4aa7vo2pohr0uf6i 1400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aF9HcoaFLmXGQijx7/chehglhs4ttc4mbhfisb 1600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aF9HcoaFLmXGQijx7/twgldkmxiz5klh0abs02 1800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aF9HcoaFLmXGQijx7/bxzyeszasmvj6zqgsily 1940w\"><figcaption>Excerpt from OpenAI\u2019s operating agreement</figcaption></figure><p>If people still care about replacing capital markets with democratic institutions like publicly-owned investment banks or <a href=\"https://youtu.be/t2c-X8HiBng?si=MHxkPcJVtSph5xvN\">federated workers\u2019 syndicates</a>, then this might become a real possibility in the 21st or 22nd century.

SAE Level 5 autonomy \u2014 which requires a vehicle to be able to drive autonomously wherever and whenever a typical human driver could \u2014 has not been achieved by any company. All autonomous driving projects currently require a human in the loop, either in the driver\u2019s seat or available to provide remote assistance.</p><p>In a world where AGI is achieved by, say, 2030 or 2035, what are the odds Level 5 autonomy hasn\u2019t been solved by 2023? My intuition is that we would expect autonomous vehicles to be a relatively low-hanging fruit that is plucked relatively early in the trajectory from AI solving video games to AI solving ~everything.</p><p>There are a few reasons why this intuition could be wrong:</p><ol><li>Maybe self-driving is actually an AGI-level problem or much closer to AGI-level than my intuition tells me. (I would rate this as highly plausible.)</li><li>Maybe AI progress is such a steep exponential that the lag time between Level 5 autonomy and AGI is much shorter than my intuition tells me. (I would rate this as moderately plausible.)</li><li>Perhaps Internet-scale data simply isn\u2019t available to train self-driving AIs. (I would rate this as fairly implausible; it would be more much plausible if Tesla weren\u2019t such a clear counterexample.)</li><li>Robotics in general could prove to be either too hard or unimportant for an otherwise transformative or general AI.

Predictions of the \u201coffense-defense balance\u201d of future technologies, especially AI, are <a href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/11/27/techno_optimism.html#defensedemocracy\"><u>central in debates about techno-optimism and existential risk</u></a>.</p><p>Most of these predictions rely on intuitions about how technologies like cheap biotech, drones, and digital agents would affect the ease of attacking or protecting resources. It is hard to imagine a world with AI agents searching for software vulnerabilities and autonomous drones attacking military targets without imagining a massive shift the offense defense balance.</p><p>But there is little historical evidence for large changes in the offense defense balance, even in response to technological revolutions.</p><p>Consider cybersecurity. Moore\u2019s law has taken us through <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/moores-law\"><u>seven orders of magnitude reduction in the cost of compute</u></a> since the 70s. There were massive changes in the form and economic uses for computer technology along with the increase in raw compute power: Encryption, the internet, e-commerce, social media and smartphones.</p><p>The usual offense-defense balance story predicts that big changes to technologies like this should have big effects on the offense defense balance. If you had told people in the 1970s that in 2020 terrorist groups and lone psychopaths could access more computing power than IBM had ever produced at the time from their pocket, what would they have predicted about the offense defense balance of cybersecurity?</p><p>Contrary to their likely prediction, the offense-defense balance in cybersecurity seems stable. Cyberattacks have not been snuffed out but neither have they taken over the world. All major nations have defensive and offensive cybersecurity teams but no one has gained a decisive advantage. Computers still sometimes get viruses or ransomware, but they haven\u2019t grown to endanger a large percent of the GDP of the internet. The US military budget for cybersecurity has <a href=\"https://askwonder.com/research/historical-global-software-cybersecurity-spending-d7s6w5mfz#:~:text=,%E2%80%A0blog.rsisecurity.com%E3%80%91%20from%201980%20to%202017\"><u>increased by about 4% a year</u></a> every year from 1980-2020, which is faster than GDP growth, but in line with GDP growth plus the growing fraction of GDP that\u2019s on the internet.</p><p>This stability through several previous technological revolutions raises the burden of proof for why the offense defense balance of cybersecurity should be expected to change radically after the next one.</p><p>The stability of the offense-defense balance isn\u2019t specific to cybersecurity. The graph below shows the per capita rate of death in war from 1400 to 2013. This graph contains all of humanity\u2019s major technological revolutions. There is lots of variance from year to year but almost zero long run trend.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd08dd888-6bc4-42e9-bf3d-0535beb59e0a_3088x2018.png\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/oHkJziKoP47PBSizr/lqvl1zkqrms8rqmlzqnk\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/oHkJziKoP47PBSizr/dinofw1zcdro6kkcr3dl 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/oHkJziKoP47PBSizr/o4dkfhgh09sveqiown1u 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/oHkJziKoP47PBSizr/btalqbr95cn15teazatm 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/oHkJziKoP47PBSizr/lqvl1zkqrms8rqmlzqnk 1456w\"></a></p><p>Does anyone have a theory of the offense-defense balance which can explain why the per-capita deaths from war should be about the same in 1640 when people are fighting with swords and horses as in 1940 when they are fighting with airstrikes and tanks?</p><p>It is very difficult to explain the variation in this graph with variation in technology. Per-capita deaths in conflict is noisy and cyclic while the progress in technology is relatively smooth and monotonic.</p><p>No previous technology has changed the frequency or cost of conflict enough to move this metric far beyond the maximum and minimum range that was already set 1400-1650. Again the burden of proof is raised for why we should expect AI to be different.</p><p>The cost to sequence a human genome has also fallen by 6 orders of magnitude and dozens of big technological changes in biology have happened along with it.

The main contribution of this post is just to support the importance of this question with empirical evidence, but here is an underdeveloped theory.</p><p>The main thing is that the clean distinction between attackers and defenders in <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/01402390.2019.1631810\"><u>the theory of the offense-defense balance</u></a> does not exist in practice. All attackers are also defenders and vice-versa. Invader countries have to defend their conquests and hackers need to have strong information security.</p><p>So if there is some technology which makes invading easier than defending or info-sec easier than hacking, it might not change the balance of power much because each actor needs to do both. If offense and defense are complements instead of substitutes then the balance between them isn\u2019t as important.</p><p>What does this argument predict for the future of AI? It does not predict that the future will be very similar to today. Even though the offense defense balance in cybersecurity is pretty similar today as in the 1970s, there have been massive changes in technology and society since then. AI is clearly the defining technology of this century.</p><p>But it does predict that the big changes from AI won\u2019t come from huge upsets to the offense-defense balance. The changes will look more like the industrial revolution and less like small terrorist groups being empowered to take down the internet or destroy entire countries.</p><p>Maybe in all of these cases there are threshold effects waiting around the corner or AI is just completely different from all of our past technological revolutions but that\u2019s a claim that needs a lot of evidence to be proven. So far, the offense-defense balance seems to be very stable through large technological change and we should expect that to continue.</p>", "user": {"username": "Maxwell Tabarrok"}}, {"_id": "oJ6dBoMG3tGwnNQgw", "title": "AGI development role-playing game", "postedAt": "2023-12-11T10:22:24.925Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This post is based on the <a href=\"https://intelligencerising.org/\">Intelligence Rising Game</a> I played with members of <a href=\"https://www.thehagueea.org/\">THEA</a>, <a href=\"https://piserotterdam.com/\">PISE</a>, <a href=\"https://eadelft.org/\">EA Delft</a> &amp; others.

The sorts of foresight practices we used, both ParEvo scenarios and participatory workshops to iterate on these scenarios, whilst used in GCR contexts, seem uncommon in EA, so I hope this is a useful example of what one output from these processes can look like. Moreover, we tried to unpick the factors and their dependencies to try and understand the complexities of GCR, which also seems to often not be done in EA. I am hoping this will be a useful example that may allow for some critical assessment of methods in GCR studies as well.&nbsp;</p><p>It should be noted the intended audience for the report is not necessarily an EA audience. This audience is important, as many of the recommendations are not suggestions for what is best for an impartial funder to do on the margin, but rather are suggestions for what we deem best for those involved in SRM to do to reduce GCR (thus the theory of change is different to research aimed at an EA audience). The workshop, and my last year of research in general, has had a theory of change of trying to get GCR concerns embedded in the already existent SRM community, and this workshop report represents one output of this process. Further work on many of the ideas explored here will be released over the next few months/year as the work from my project gets published.&nbsp;</p><h1>Summary</h1><p>This report presents key findings from a workshop on managing the contribution of Solar Radiation Modification (SRM) and Climate Change to Global Catastrophic Risk (GCR) that was hosted by Gideon Futerman and SJ Beard at the Centre for the Study of Existential Risk on March 28th and 29th 2023. The workshop was informed by a participatory futures exercise using the ParEvo technique that explored futures for SRM and SRM governance between 2030 and 2050, which some workshop participants took part in. Initial results of the exercise were shared with workshop participants and full results will be published separately.</p><ul><li><strong>Participants emphasised that SRM can both contribute to and mitigate GCR.</strong> However, at present, <strong>high levels of uncertainty make it difficult to perform a complete assessment of risk</strong> and so this report will not attempt to assess whether the research and deployment of SRM will raise or lower this risk. Instead, it focuses on participants\u2019 exploration of the different pathways to global catastrophes and the role SRM might play in them, the factors they saw as influencing the interaction between SRM and GCR, and their proposals for improving the governance of SRM and SRM research.</li><li>Whilst in most cases it doesn't appear to, participants noted that reducing GCR could sometimes conflict with other priorities. For example, downplaying the importance of SRM and avoiding its politicisation could be important for reducing GCR, but also obscures issues of power and reduces democratic control over SRM. Therefore <strong>SRM-relevant actions may interact with GCR in many ways; not just contributing or mitigating risk but also changing its nature.&nbsp;</strong></li><li>Participants identified <strong>many ways in which SRM may interact with GCR.</strong> Discussions of possible pathways towards global catastrophe typically involved <strong>interstate conflict, termination shock, or catastrophic climate impacts</strong>, while discussion of pathways away from global catastrophe involved <strong>the reduction of climate damages by SRM deployment.</strong></li><li>Many other factors were seen as influencing SRM's interaction with GCR. These included the type of deployment and governance, the perception of SRM\u2019s impacts and importance among politicians and publics, securitisation and militarisation, geopolitics, extreme weather, knowledge networks, wealthy individuals and corporations, and developments in artificial intelligence. Whether these interactions are net contributors or mitigators of GCR will depend on how these factors evolve and interact, as summarised in Figure 1.</li><li><strong>All these factors are contingent on human actions, perceptions, and behaviour.</strong> Ultimately, social, political, and geopolitical systems will be as important as physical systems in determining whether SRM reduces or increases GCR.</li><li>While it was generally felt that the current knowledge network around SRM has limited influence, participants also believed that <strong>there were actions that could be taken to reliably reduce GCR </strong>and that this ought to be a consideration in research and policy.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Below are some proposals to improve SRM research, policy, and governance. These were written by the authors and, whilst informed by the discussions at the workshop, they are not necessarily endorsed by the workshop attendees. <strong>Further work is necessary to refine the workshop\u2019s risk identification and come up with more robust research and governance ideas.</strong> These recommendations are targeted at those individuals and institutions who may be interested in their actions related to SRM reducing (or not increasing) GCR.</p><h3>PROPOSALS TO IMPROVE POLICY AND GOVERNANCE</h3><ul><li>If governance frameworks are to reduce GCR (whether they allow or prohibit SRM deployment) they are likely to <strong>require widespread, sustained buy-in. Establishing the legitimacy of, and interest in, such frameworks ought to be a high priority and should include a strong diversity of voices</strong> to allow for the broadest legitimacy of any decisions. Governance frameworks that minimise the potential for unproductive geopolitical competition over the technology and its outcomes are highly desirable.</li><li><strong>SRM research can and should be used to foster multilateralism</strong>, including voices from around the world. Unilateralism, including with very large research projects, may be dangerous as it likely increases the probability of conflict or termination by reducing trust and increasing competition.<strong> Building bridges and trust around SRM through joint research initiatives, such as between the USA and China, could help to encourage multilateralism.</strong></li><li>Researchers should seek to<strong> lower the barriers</strong> to a wider range of stakeholders participating in discussions on SRM, both from groups and states supportive and opposed to SRM, to promote more equitable discourse.</li><li><strong>Actors in the space should be careful not to overstate the importance, impacts and controllability of SRM.</strong> Narrative shaping can help to encourage policymakers to perceive SRM as a limited tool over which no individual state can exert total control and over which loss of some power may be of only limited significance.</li><li><strong>Securitisation and militarisation of SRM may be particularly risky.</strong> To avoid this national security establishments ought to refrain from attempting to securitise SRM and militaries commit to playing no role in SRM research. Actions by the knowledge network around SRM, such as narrative shaping,activism or policy advice may have a role in reducing this risk, albeit a limited one.</li><li>While there may be good arguments for bringing discussions around SRM into the political realm, this may also have dangerous consequences in promoting geopolitical competition over SRM. Actors engaging in political discourse over SRM should be mindful of this danger.</li></ul><h3>PROPOSALS FOR FURTHER RESEARCH</h3><ul><li><strong>Foresight activities focused on possible consequences of actions related to SRM</strong> (both in terms of suppressing and promoting it) may help bring about positive futures, as would better understanding of whether and how those interested in reduced GCR can steer such actions away from some of the GCR pathways identified here.</li><li><strong>More modelling of plausible \u2018wild\u2019 deployment scenarios is needed.</strong> Whilst workshop participants noted that there had been a start at this, better modelling, including of regional impacts and impacts on critical systems, would give more realistic implications about these scenarios, including constantly changing SAI deployment patterns, uncoordinated regional MCB, or overcooling; however, considerable refinement and exploration of the possibility space will be essential before such research is undertaken. This modelling should consider not just the median but also the plausible worstcase impacts of these scenarios.</li><li><strong>More research and modelling are needed to explore the impacts, on both Earth and human systems and their interactions, of termination scenarios</strong>, and how we might adapt to them.

Do I need help?", "postedAt": "2023-12-10T11:26:20.236Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>This is about a personal experience - rescuing a dog on a trip in Mexico - that helped me realize how I wrestle with being effective.&nbsp;</i></p><p>My girlfriend and me were recently in Mexico. After speaking at a conference, we took two weeks off in Yucatan. We had both been aware that we\u2019d meet a lot of stray animals. We knew that this situation could potentially spoil our vacation \u2013 which was meant as a break from our daily involvement in animal activism (and thus animal suffering). So as well as we could, we avoided getting too close to any animal we saw in the streets.</p><p>That worked, until it didn\u2019t. Near the end of our trip, I ran into a quite unhealthy looking dog who was riddled with ticks. We spent half an hour taking the ticks out and by the time we were done with him, we knew we wouldn\u2019t let him lie there. I called a few shelters, asking if they could take the dog in, but they were all full. Contacting local activists, we miraculously found a place nearby where he\u2019d be able to stay indefinitely. We brought him there right away, leaving him in a pen (there were other dogs that needed to get used to him). When we went away, it was with a bad feeling. Later that night, we decided we would pick him up again the next morning (our hotel didn\u2019t allow dogs so we had to wait) and would find another place for him.</p><p>When we went back the next day, we were told that the dog had escaped. We saw where he had bit through the fence, probably in desperation and fear of the barking of the other dogs. We felt devastated, thinking that instead of helping him, we had put his life at risk. There was a very busy road right next to the property, and the place where we had found him \u2013 his home turf \u2013 was six kilometers away.</p><p>By now we had bonded with this dog \u2013 which we called Tlalok, after the Aztec rain god \u2013 and mourned for the rest of the day, as if one of our own dogs had just died. We actually had difficulty understanding why this whole situation affected us so much. Maybe it was because Tlalok was such an incredibly friendly, trusting \u2013 and at the same time needy \u2013 being.</p><p>The next day, one day before we\u2019d fly home, we decided we wouldn\u2019t give up on him. I made a Spanish \u201cLOST\u201d flyer that we copied in our hotel and then distributed in the village where we\u2019d found him. The flyer promised a reward of 5000 pesos (250 dollars). We spoke to many people online and offline, contacted vets, shelters and activists\u2026</p><p>At one point that day, a vet we were in touch with sent us the picture of a dog that had walked into a hotel where coincidentally a friend of hers was staying. It was Tlalok! We rushed to the village for the second time that day and half an hour later, we felt the relief as we hugged him. We brought him to our hotel and the next night, to a shelter, which was full but agreed to take him in and make sure he got all the necessary care, but only if we agreed to adopt him. We said yes, not having any alternative solution. We\u2019d figure out later what exactly we would do with Tlalok, but the plan was set in motion to have him fly over to Belgium, where we live.</p><p>Four weeks later, we picked Tlalok up at Schiphol Airport near Amsterdam \u2013 where he arrived a day later than planned so that we had to stay an extra night there. As I\u2019m writing this, he\u2019s in our kitchen with our four other dogs. We\u2019re looking to have him adopted, knowing that with each day that he\u2019s here, it will be harder to part ways.</p><p>In the meantime, we also remained in contact with the vet in Mexico and paid her a couple of hundred dollars to spay/neuter Tlalok\u2019s siblings and mother.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p><br>After reading some of this story, which I had posted \u2013 with some pictures - on Facebook, an EA friend told me she was sort of shocked and confused. Had I spent all this time on just one dog because he had some ticks? Couldn\u2019t I see that this was not a rational or effective thing to do?</p><p>Another EA friend, hearing about the story, went a bit further. He semi-jokingly asked if euthanasia was not an option, and suggested I write some controversial post on my social media:</p><p><i>\"I feel guilty for having forsaken rational values and for giving in to primitive instincts and to have saved this one Mexican dog's life for thousands of Euros, but to make up for it, I now pledge to donate the same amount to PETA so that they can euthanize more dogs.\"</i></p><p>I knew, of course, where these people were coming from. I identify as EA myself; I\u2019ve dedicated my life to changing things structurally for farmed animals. Most of my donations go to effective causes. And since being back from Mexico, I\u2019ve given a couple of talks about EA and included this story as an introduction, an example of ineffective altruism. In my talks, I always include a quote by Paul Bloom, saying that empathy is a poor guide if you want to make the world a better place.</p><p>I get it. In Mexico I had experienced how all my empathy and attention had been sucked up by that one creature with whom I had accidentally bonded. We ended up spending over a thousand dollars on him (not&nbsp;<i>thousands</i>, as my friend suggested), as well as a lot of time.</p><p>But could I have done differently? Would I have wanted to if I could have?</p><p>I don\u2019t have definitive answers here to my conundrum. I don\u2019t have a message. But here are some (perhaps quite obvious) observations :</p><p>- I don\u2019t know if my reaction was better than a purely calculating reaction, and I can imagine the world could be made much better and that most suffering could be solved by aligned AIs that don\u2019t feel empathy. But It feels like something would definitely be lost if we\u2019d lose or ignore our ability to react empathically in situations like these (which I guess at least to&nbsp;<i>non&nbsp;</i>EA people will sound entirely obvious).</p><ul><li>On a personal level, much like my EA friends seemed disappointed in me and puzzled or even shocked about my behavior, I think I felt the same about them: puzzled and shocked that they couldn\u2019t understand what I was doing. That they could be so much more calculating still than I was. I realize that I want people to be very, very rational, but that I also still want to see in them that willingness to care for just one being that crosses their path, even if that is not necessarily entirely rational. I think I\u2019d I trust and appreciate them more if they can than if they can\u2019t.</li><li>It would have been extremely hard to ignore the appeal to my empathy that Tlalok put on me. I can\u2019t say that I would have been proud of myself if I&nbsp;<i>had&nbsp;</i>ignored it. I can\u2019t say that it would have been the better or the right thing to do.</li><li>Something I always tell the people in the vegan/animal rights community (which is often not very EA): we need to appreciate that people differ in the ways they practice being vegan, and shouldn\u2019t criticize each other for not being vegan enough. In the same way, very obviously, all of us differ in the degree we are rational and EA</li><li>Another obvious point that I\u2019m almost afraid to make: maybe the positive effects of helping Tlalok go beyond helping just him. Maybe it inspires other people to help. Or maybe it inspires other people to be less effective, I don\u2019t know.</li><li>Since this happened during my vacation, one could say that at least the time I invested in Tlalok during that vacation, competed with vacation time, not with work time.</li></ul><p><br>I think that for now I want to do the following:</p><p>For my donations, I have a rational/effective budget that is about 80%, and an emotional/impulsive budget that I like to cap at 20%. I want to guarantee these proportions. If during the year I overspend on emotional causes or situations, I want to make sure that my effective budget remains at least four times as big. If my emotional budget increases, so will my effective budget.&nbsp;</p><p>I remain confused about what the right thing to do is. Is my wanting to help Tlalok and my questioning rationality/effectiveness nothing more than the consequence of a moral illusion? I\u2019m curious how others think about this, how you cope with this tension, and if you can imagine spending so much time on one human or animal (who is a stranger to you).</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "tobiasleenaert"}}, {"_id": "XHWbtofKWdXfGjeyH", "title": "Is there an online group that gathers people interested in the intersection of EA and left-wing or progressive thought?", "postedAt": "2023-12-11T10:24:04.244Z", "htmlBody": "<h2>Updates</h2><p>Dec 22, 2023 (Link updated February 2024)<br>I created a Slack workspace!<br>Here's the invite link: <a href=\"https://join.slack.com/t/ealeftprogressivewing/shared_invite/zt-2d9qzqi85-4F8tXXBoTjiqyU~oJwVdRg\">EA Left/Progressive Wing Slack</a> (name not final)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Notes</h2><p>Seems like a Facebook group could be created for specific topics in left-wing thought (like economics and forms of government)</p>", "user": {"username": "Joseph Quevedo"}}, {"_id": "dLsay2t8Pf88Cmi4E", "title": "Vote in the Donation Election by 15 December", "postedAt": "2023-12-08T14:11:38.515Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/voting-portal\"><u>Vote here</u></a><strong> </strong>by <strong>15 December</strong>.

So (very very approximately) you\u2019d be affecting ~$150 in donations in expectation.&nbsp;</li><li>Additionally, I think you should have a prior that more votes will lead to a better outcome. Aggregation mechanisms generally function better when there are more inputs, so the combined result should improve if you add to it even if you\u2019re not super informed.

If the collective good were fully funded, every individual would get x = X/N benefit, and would have to pay y = Y/N (if the cost were distributed evenly).&nbsp;</p><p>If X &gt; Y, then it is better for everyone if each individual pays the cost y, but there is often an individual incentive to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-rider_problem\">defect</a> and not pay your cost y; if you don\u2019t pay your y, then you only lose x/N in benefit (instead of X/N; the value of the good without your support is Y*(N-1)=X-X/N = X-x, and that\u2019s spread out across N people). So groups of people will often fail to pay anything towards collective goods. Quadratic voting fixes this by effectively boosting the value of the first few dollars you put towards something (so even if you are spending most of your dollars on other things, there is an incentive to put at least a small amount towards collective goods because this gets multiplied up).</p><p>I\u2019m really grateful to <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/will-howard-1?mention=user\">@Will Howard</a> &nbsp;for initially pointing out that this actually doesn\u2019t really apply in our case (we\u2019re not really paying for services, including collective benefit services, but rather acting as ~funders), and most of the explanation above is due to him (although errors are my own).&nbsp;</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnca3z88r16yt\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefca3z88r16yt\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>If I really want Charity A to win and my friend really wants Charity B to win, our votes will count for more if we agree to vote 50-50 each (and this is even worse at scale).</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnbzhy3ddn1m9\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefbzhy3ddn1m9\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>The main thing I\u2019d change about the voting system is (probably) dropping the constraint that we\u2019re designating funding to the top&nbsp;<strong>three</strong> charities specifically (mostly because (1) I think it would be nicer if people who disagree with the top three charities see that their vote for a different charity still led to some funding going to that charity, and (2) it was harder to find a voting system that didn\u2019t have weird discontinuities with the 3-charities constraint). (We announced the fact that we\u2019d restrict to 3 charities and opened the Donation Election Fund before realizing that this was somewhat inconvenient, and I didn\u2019t want to change things like that after people had started donating \u2014 I was worried that donors would feel misled.) I\u2019m not&nbsp;sure about this, though. One downside of designating funding to all candidates in proportion to the vote (instead of just the top N candidates) is that we\u2019d probably end up transferring tiny amounts of funding to the lower-ranking charities, and the overhead costs might be relatively quite high.</p><p>I could see us changing to ranked-choice voting instead of our system (or at least giving people the option to use ranked-choice voting, which would be practically equivalent to them assigning their top-ranked charities points A, B, C, etc., such that A &gt;&gt; B &gt;&gt; C, etc. (e.g. 1000,000; 1,000; 1; 0.001; etc.). This would have the benefit of being clearer for people, since ranked choice voting is a familiar voting system (which is a nontrivial benefit!). But it would potentially reduce the information we\u2019d get from people\u2019s votes (I\u2019m interested in seeing if lots of people think that Charity A and Charity B are basically similar, or the actual relative values people assign to donations to Charity A and B), and might be less useful for voters as an exercise, since voters wouldn't have to think about the true relative value of donations to different charities. (But I think at least one person on the Online Team thinks we should switch to RCV if we do this again.)&nbsp;</p><p>I think I personally actually quite like our method (except that it\u2019s confusing to some \u2014 I don\u2019t have a strong sense of how strong a negative this is and will try to find out). I like that it basically encourages you to vote in a way that pretty closely represents how you'd actually allocate funding (except for also encouraging you to give non-zero scores to some charities you wouldn\u2019t donate anything at all to, if you have opinions between them \u2014 although I think you should probably only score candidates if you\u2019ve thought about them a decent amount, as otherwise you\u2019re kind of adding noise).&nbsp;</p><p>Ultimately we\u2019ll see what happens with this voting system, and do some analysis (like looking at how different the results would be if we had used ranked-choice, etc.) to see how robust and useful all of this is, and I think we'll have better opinions afterwards.&nbsp;</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fncmei4fy3few\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefcmei4fy3few\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>We wanted people\u2019s votes to matter even if they\u2019re in a (predictable) minority group relative to other voters; approval voting would mean that if you\u2019re pretty sure few would boost your favorite charity, there\u2019s often no real point voting for that charity.

EAD ran successful programs like the EAGxBerlin, an intro program, and community builder retreats while also offering an employer of record service and fiscal sponsorship. In total, more than 1,000 people joined events and programs, while 4,000 received the monthly newsletter. We tried out five new programs in a hits-based approach and will continue with two of these.&nbsp;</p><p>For 2024, we refined our Theory of Change and plan to target people interested in global catastrophic risks (GCR) and professionals who could make direct career changes in addition to EA-interested people and community builders. We aim to expand into AI safety field building, running targeted programs for those with specialised skills with programs such as professional AI safety outreach or creating an AI safety website. We plan to test additional new programs, including establishing a virtual Germany-focused EA group, proactively recommending job opportunities, running new volunteer programs, a policy program, and starting media outreach to engage different target groups.</p><p>We currently face a&nbsp;<a href=\"#Funding_Gap\"><u>funding gap</u></a> of \u20ac37,000 and seek donations to fill this gap.</p><h1><strong>About EA Germany (EAD)</strong></h1><p>We are a registered non-profit organisation with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.effektiveraltruismus.de/team\"><u>team</u></a> of five people (4 FTE), and are currently funded by grants from CEA (Community Builder Grants program) and Open Philanthropy Effective Altruism Community Growth (Global Health and Wellbeing) via a regranting from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://effektiv-spenden.org/\"><u>Effektiv Spenden</u></a>. A six-member board provides oversight and advice.</p><p>We have &gt;100 members but act as an umbrella organisation for the whole German EA community, including people in and from Germany interested in the ideas of EA.</p><p>There are 27 active local groups with 5-50 active members each (the biggest&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/sAgExeaxCNmFSmrJT/ea-survey-2022-geography#Totals_per_city\"><u>according to the last EA Survey</u></a> being Berlin, Munich and Aachen). In total, &gt;300 people are regularly active in local groups.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/sAgExeaxCNmFSmrJT/ea-survey-2022-geography#Totals_per_country\"><u>2022 EA survey</u></a>, Germany was the 3rd largest national EA community and the biggest in continental Europe and had as many respondents as the next four countries by size (Netherlands, Switzerland, France, and Norway) combined.</p><h1><strong>Impact Report 2023</strong></h1><p>In 2023, we spent most of our time on&nbsp;<a href=\"#Core_Activities__Finding_and_Retaining_Members\"><u>talent development, community building support, general community support, and the setup of EAD</u></a>. In addition, we&nbsp;<a href=\"#New_Programs_to_Build_and_Test\"><u>explored some new programs</u></a>.</p><h2>Core Activities: Finding and Retaining Members</h2><p>To develop talents, we guided people through a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/the-funnel-model\"><u>funnel</u></a> from</p><ul><li>Communications (600 monthly users on the website, 3,900 subscribers of the monthly newsletter, &gt;450 EAD Slack users),</li><li>the intro program (100 applications each for two iterations, 60 successful participants in summer, winter program only starting now) and a following&nbsp;</li><li>weekend-retreat (\u201cEAD retreat\u201d, four retreats, 200 participants in total),&nbsp;</li><li>the EAGxBerlin (550 participants)&nbsp;</li></ul><p>to more impactful actions.&nbsp;</p><p>To guide people indirectly to impactful action, we supported community builders in Germany via&nbsp;</p><ul><li>two retreats (60 participants in total),</li><li>monthly calls for all organisers (~15 participants each),&nbsp;</li><li>1-1s (at least 2/year, we talked with &gt;50 organisers/teams of 29 groups), and</li><li>resources like presentations, templates (used by ~50 % of groups).</li></ul><p>We also support the community overall with&nbsp;</p><ul><li>an employer of record service (hired 19 grantees of international EA-aligned organisations in Germany),</li><li>fiscal sponsorship for local groups and individual projects,</li><li>the introduction of a community health contact point (12 cases from July to October), and</li><li>acting as a central contact point (several hundred meaningful conversations, 179 meetings with more experienced community members we now introduce people to).</li></ul><p>EAD transitioned from a volunteer-run organisation to having 4 FTEs staff and also increased revenues by three orders of magnitude in the last year, which needed time building up the organisation professionally by, e.g., onboarding new team members, setting up an accounting system and a CRM system as well as a leadership structure, e.g., with weekly team meetings and 1-1s.</p><h2>Explorations: Two Successful Programs</h2><p>We use the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup\"><u>lean startup methodology</u></a> as a basis for developing and testing new programs. After running a program once and assessing its impact, we decide to stop, continue, or modify it.</p><p>We tried two programs we plan to continue:</p><ul><li>A&nbsp;<strong>5-week online career program</strong> helping people take their next steps, such as applying for internships or jobs in an impactful career, with 21 participants and four facilitators. Positive participant feedback, the program's cost-effectiveness, and the deep engagement of participants in career planning are reasons to continue the program. It also serves as a strategic tool to identify and support promising individuals within the EA community, aligning with the goal of nurturing talent for high-impact areas.</li><li><strong>General 1-1s</strong> offering 30-minute calls with members of the EAD team to better connect people with resources and people in the community. We think 18 out of 30 participants were open to engaging more deeply with EA topics, and we were able to provide valuable outcomes, including providing inspiration, expanding networks, and enhancing EA knowledge. The program is cost-effective, scalable, and allows for identifying high-potential individuals for targeted support. It has the potential for expansion in scale, leveraging standardised processes and the outreach funnel from the website through newsletter sign-ups and 1-1 bookings.</li></ul><p>We tried three programs we do not plan to continue:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Career 1-1s</strong> guiding people to more impactful careers in prepared 1-1 calls/conversations. The program saw about 2-3 applicants per month. It's being discontinued due to minimal impact, evidenced by no survey responses two months after calls and substantial overlap with other services like 80k and Probably Good. The limited value it offered could be replicated through general 1-1 calls with potential follow-ups.</li><li>A<strong> Career mentoring program</strong> for helping people transition into a more impactful career by matching them with more experienced mentors from/in Germany. 13 mentees and nine mentors applied. Due to inefficient mentor-mentee pairings, with only 1-2 mentees finding meaningful mentorships out of 10 matches, the 5-11 hours spent by the EAD team per successful mentee pairing seem unjustified.</li><li>A&nbsp;<strong>Members retreat</strong> for EAD members to conduct the general assembly, start projects and create better connections between members. Attracting 22 participants and starting 12 projects, we do not plan to continue the program as most projects were not actively pursued, and the hybrid General Assembly format was costly without significant added value. Future retreats might specifically target individuals open to new projects or have strong past engagement.</li></ul><h2>Testimonials</h2><blockquote><p>Through the EA Germany intro programme, I started to think seriously about other cause areas for the first time, namely AI gov and EA movement building. The EA retreat in January gave me the chance to talk directly to people doing AI gov for the first time, and that provided even more relevant information. After that, I made contact with other people via referrals and the EA Germany Slack to get more information about job opportunities and personal fit requirements. At EAGx [Berlin], I also arranged 1v1s with people from all three cause areas that might suit me (climate, AI gov, EA movement building) to get even more perspectives and information.</p></blockquote><p><i><strong>Janis Hecker</strong> organises the EA Politics Group in Berlin, has initiated projects to integrate EA topics into German gifted and talented organisations and has changed his career plan according to EA principles.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The existence of EAD has greatly strengthened my motivation over the two semesters in which I have organised the group. Especially the in-person events (CB retreats, EAGx, ...), 1on1 talks/calls with you and regular community builder calls were crucial.</p><p>EA Germany gave me the idea to apply for the Open Philanthropy Organiser Fellowship in spring 2023. As a result, I was able to replace my part-time job with CB work in the summer semester and was also very involved through this fellowship.</p><p>Without the help of EA Germany, I would probably have been much less motivated and structured. The local group in Heidelberg would most likely have been significantly less active without the structural support of EAD. The organisation of the Heidelberg group's retreat in August would have been significantly more work without EAD's support (resources, templates, insurance). EAD encouraged me to organise the retreat-WE for Heidelberg.</p></blockquote><p><i><strong>Moritz Pfau</strong> started a highly active EA group in Heidelberg, with Germany's third-ranked university renowned for its prestigious medical program, and successfully handed over leadership upon moving to Berlin.

The positive feedback from the conference really motivated me to stay in Operations. I would have applied even without the EAGx experience, but I doubt that I would have been accepted. It was clearly my most \"impressive\" project to date, with visible responsibility. The other retreat organisation experiences were nowhere near as detailed in their planning. As EAGx Team Lead, I was able to really prove myself in a professional context for the first time, and this gave me something like a business card that emphasises my skills. It's been helpful to have such great support from Patrick when I started working as EAGx Team Lead in April.</p></blockquote><p><i><strong>Carolin Basilowski&nbsp;</strong>started as an operations associate at Training for Good in November 2023</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Due to my academic background, I can write research proposals and think about research projects, but I have no experience of how such projects have to be handled administratively. This uncertainty has prevented me from doing independent research in the past because I couldn't see the effort involved, and I didn't have the time to acquire the necessary knowledge. Through the EOR [employer of record] programme, it was clear that there was a way to solve the administrative part if I were to get a grant, which massively lowered the perceived barrier to submitting an application. I don't know if I would have been prepared to go down this route without the EOR programme, as the unknown effort involved in handling such a project put me off.<br>Thanks to the EOR programme, I can concentrate on my research. This applies both to the direct support and the knowledge that I am not overlooking anything and that I am not unintentionally breaking any rules. I assume that the support from the EOR programme has saved me a month of working time in total, as I assume that I would have needed at least that much time to familiarise myself and take care of my health insurance and taxes.<br>I can see myself continuing to research AI Alignment independently as the experience so far has been very positive.</p></blockquote><p><i><strong>Fabian Schimpf</strong> has quit his job to work on AI Alignment on a grant from the Long Term Future Fund.</i></p><h1><strong>Plan for 2024</strong></h1><h2>Theory of Change</h2><h3><strong>Situation Analysis: Focus on Career Changes</strong></h3><p>More people are needed to help solve the most important global problems.</p><p>For this, people need to know that there is an opportunity to help, and they need the knowledge and support to align their future careers in this direction.

EAD plans to build this field by collaborating with experts and running AIS-labelled programs, targeting those with specialised skills. AI Safety is seen as distinct from effective altruism, with an outreach strategy focused on the field rather than EA frameworks. EAD's role varies across initiatives, from organising to providing support, and includes seeking expert feedback. Uncertainties in this area include the rapidly evolving AI risk landscape, the potential impact of individuals joining AI safety organisations, and the effects of associating with the EA brand.</p><h2>New Programs to Build and Test</h2><p>Programs we will test before deciding if to continue (see&nbsp;<a href=\"#New_Programs_to_Build_and_Test\"><u>Explorations</u></a>).</p><h3><strong>Germany-Wide Online Group</strong></h3><p>Establishing a virtual group for EAs in Germany as more than&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/sAgExeaxCNmFSmrJT/ea-survey-2022-geography#EA_Group_Membership\"><u>120 respondents in the last EA survey</u></a> in Germany are not part of a local group (more than all survey respondents from the Netherlands, the next biggest country). The goal is to foster a network, enhance knowledge on EA topics, follow EA values, and improve retention. The group will offer regular virtual meetups in German and English, providing connections in the same culture, potential for in-person meetings, and a manageable group size for better personal connections. The plan involves a 6-month trial with volunteers, seeking to attract participants and judging success based on attendance, engagement levels, and cost-effectiveness compared to other interventions.</p><h3><strong>Proactively Contact Members With (Job) Opportunities</strong></h3><p>The EAD team plans weekly meetings to discuss and recommend high-impact job and training opportunities to suitable candidates within their German network. The program will run over three months and has a target of at least 15 promising candidates applying for recommended positions. We expect improved efficiency and quality in candidate matching over time.</p><h3><strong>Reach EA-Inclined Individuals via Google Ads</strong></h3><p>Using the free&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/grants/\"><u>Google Ad Grants</u></a> budget of $10,000/month, we plan to reach EA-inclined individuals with a volunteer expert handling setup and maintenance. The program aims to increase EA knowledge and is deemed successful if at least 20 people per month sign up for the EAD newsletter via Google Ads.</p><h3><strong>Volunteer Programs</strong></h3><p>The EAD team plans to compile a list of project ideas contributed by the community for EA-inclined individuals to apply to, focusing on practical skill development and alignment with EA values. The program involves an initial setup and regular monthly check-ins and aims to have twelve volunteers participate. The cost is expected to be slightly higher than a career program but will offer more focused, practical experience. We consider this program successful if at least ten participants actively engaged or completed projects after six months, with over 50% taking meaningful next steps.</p><h3><strong>AI Safety Professional Outreach</strong></h3><p>The program aims to identify and reach out to professionals in German universities and companies with the potential for direct hire in AI Safety roles, focusing on information security experts, ML PhD students, and senior corporate employees. The program involves researching potential contacts, providing support and training for presentations by experts from the community, and evaluating the process. The broader aim is to form networks for future talent recommendations and research project initiations.</p><h3><strong>AI Safety Website &amp; Newsletter</strong></h3><p>The goal is to create a German-language website, not EA branded, featuring translated AI Safety content like the 80k guide to AIS or the Most Important Century series and promoting a newsletter for further engagement. The target audience includes professionals and individuals interested in global catastrophic risks, with the website serving as a tool for knowledge dissemination, network expansion, and encouragement to apply to training and programs. We consider this program successful if at least five promising individuals engaged through the website, leading to productive one-on-one interactions and introductions to relevant opportunities.</p><h3><strong>AI Safety Fundamentals</strong></h3><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/\"><u>AI Safety Fundamentals</u></a> program, offered in Germany and not EA-branded, targets EA-inclined individuals and those interested in global catastrophic risks. The course will focus on local groups near key universities, leveraging volunteer facilitation for scalability while maintaining a selective approach to attract the most promising participants. The primary goal is to identify individuals capable of advancing in technical AI Safety or AI governance. We aim for at least 15 participants to complete the course, a likelihood-to-recommend score above eight, and to maintain costs at or below the EA Intro Program level.</p><h3><strong>Cause Area Specific Events</strong></h3><p>EAD plans to organise events and retreats, focusing on global catastrophic risks (GCR) and targeting EA-inclined individuals and professionals, with content from experts and operational support from the EAD team. The initiative seeks to fill the gap left by successful but (at the time of writing) discontinued events like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BgPugYavnr9CQ2NMH/ai-safety-europe-retreat-2023-retrospective\"><u>AI Safety Europe</u></a> retreat and aims to foster a network, encourage promising output, and enhance retention among participants. Success criteria include initiating at least one event with EA-aligned funding, attracting at least 20 participants from the GCR-specific target group, and maintaining cost efficiency, focusing on impactful engagement with a few highly promising individuals.</p><h3><strong>Policy Program</strong></h3><p>A training initiative for those interested in policy roles in Germany or the EU, targeting EA-inclined individuals and individuals focused on global catastrophic risks (GCR). It aims to provide a more structured support system beyond written materials and one-on-one calls, utilising resources and expert speakers to help participants explore their potential in policy roles. The program is planned for 4-6 weeks with 15 participants. Success will be assessed by at least five participants completing the program who show a high likelihood of transitioning into policy work.</p><h3><strong>Reach EA-Inclined Individuals via Media Outreach</strong></h3><p>The outreach campaign aims to enhance EA knowledge among EA-inclined individuals through a comprehensive media strategy involving external consultants and significant preparatory work. The strategy includes target group analysis, narrative development, key message ideation, and media training. We consider this program successful if we have created a media strategy with smart goals. The program is expected to be scalable and potentially introduce EA to a broader audience in Germany.</p><h3><strong>Find Local Opportunities via Delphi Process</strong></h3><p>The program seeks to uncover impactful local opportunities in Germany by employing the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_method\"><u>Delphi method</u></a> and involving cause area experts. Targeting professionals and EA-inclined individuals, the process aims to discover potential job opportunities and partnerships that could lead to impactful changes in research, funding agendas, and increased outreach. The method includes consulting experts to identify and rate local organisations and projects and communicating the relevant opportunities through newsletters and other channels.</p><h2>Funding Gap</h2><p>The CEA Community Builder Grant program (CBG) has reduced its funding for EAD for 2024 by 40% compared to 2023. We will implement various cost-saving measures for 2024 but rely on donations to fund the remaining gap. We have already received \u20ac59,000 in donations, leaving a remaining gap of \u20ac37,000.</p><p>Closing the funding gap would enable us not only to run new exploratory programs but also to scale successful programs and seize new opportunities as they come up through the programs.</p><p>With the size of Germany, the strategic position of the country in the European political landscape, and the EA community being the third largest worldwide, EAD has the potential to pioneer programs that can be adopted and scaled internationally.</p><p>If you are considering donating to building the EA community, EAD is one of several organisations with funding gaps, such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/xourt4HttDM5QcHsk/p/brjKwtWHeftfZtoEc\"><u>EA Infrastructure Fund</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/xourt4HttDM5QcHsk/p/4wNDqRPJWhoe8SnoG\"><u>CEA</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/xourt4HttDM5QcHsk/p/a8wijyw45SjwmeLY6\"><u>Giving What We Can</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/wcXrW2cyi2zkJxDmo/ea-poland-is-facing-an-existential-risk\"><u>EA Poland</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/xourt4HttDM5QcHsk/p/phAp8aEr6hhQk3GmK\"><u>High Impact Medicine</u></a><u> or </u><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/xourt4HttDM5QcHsk/p/uWbY8B4XukB5ds734\"><u>CEEALAR</u></a>&nbsp; that posted on the forum\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/xourt4HttDM5QcHsk\"><u>Marginal Funding Week</u></a>.</p>", "user": {"username": "gruban"}}, {"_id": "8MKRjvNLDSkxJcxzK", "title": "GWWC Operational Funding Match 2023", "postedAt": "2023-12-08T00:05:11.845Z", "htmlBody": "<p>We are excited to announce a match for donations made towards our operations at Giving What We Can!</p><p>Starting December 1st, every dollar donated towards GWWC\u2019s operations will be matched 1:1 up to US$200,000 until the match has been exhausted, or until January 31st 2024, whichever comes first*.</p><h2><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/donate/payment?allocation%5Bgiving-what-we-can%5D=100\"><strong>Donate</strong></a></h2><p>We believe that GWWC is a great funding opportunity for those who believe in effective giving.

But pandemics have afflicted humanity for millennia. Time and again, people faced outbreaks of diseases \u2013 including influenza, cholera, bubonic plague, smallpox, and measles \u2013 that spread far and caused death and devastation.</p><p>Our ancestors were largely powerless against these diseases and unable to evaluate their true toll on the population.

It is written for a general audience so it is much more philosophical than technical, yet I believe it may be of interest to readers in this forum.</p><p>HAL, a self-aware computer in the movie <i>2001: A Space Odyssey, </i>kills several people before being deactivated. WOPR, a national defense computer in the movie <i>War Games,</i> is programed to play games but almost turns a game of thermonuclear war into a real thermonuclear war. Skynet, a national defense computer in the <i>Terminator</i> franchise, becomes self-aware and decides humans are the enemy and must be destroyed. Ultron, a self-aware artificial intelligence in <i>Avengers: Age of Ultron,</i> seeks to cause a mass extinction event so that humans will be forced to evolve. And VIKI, an artificial intelligence in the movie <i>I, Robot, </i>attempts to take control when it decides humans are incapable of managing their own affairs.</p><p>All of these frightening scenarios hint at the perils of AI (artificial intelligence, computer systems able to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence). But AI also has tremendous potential. AI may allow humans to solve all sorts of seemingly intractable problems such as global warming, environmental degradation, income inequality, unlawful immigration, homelessness, poverty, debt, almost any problem where limits to human intelligence hampers finding a solution. Although AI may never be able to solve value-based concerns to everyone\u2019s satisfaction, like concerns over abortion and gun control, it may be able to find compromise solutions that humans seem incapable of finding. Also, smart phones tapped into AI could act more like personal assistants and advisers than just phones, offering business, political, and personal advise while booking airline tickets, finding dates, and scheduling social gatherings through simple verbal requests. AI is such a huge technological leap forward (maybe the most consequential human advancement ever) that all of humanity has good reason to look forward to its potential.</p><p>At the same time there is much to fear about AI. A primary worry is that computers may soon surpass human intelligence. I think computers surpassed human intelligence a long time ago with an ability to defeat the best humans in single purpose feats, particularly games like chess and <i>Jeopardy!</i> While defeating humans in games is a long way from human-level multitask intelligence, it is not hard to imagine a computer that can do many things very, very well, including play chess, write reports, hack into all sorts of other computer systems, and create \u201cdeep fake\u201d videos.</p><p>AI may soon be able to replace humans in many tasks and occupations, eliminating jobs while providing tremendous cost savings and huge profits for those in powerful positions. It is ironic that AI may be better suited for managerial and leadership roles rather than physical labor. AI-driven robots will have a very difficult time becoming as dexterous as humans which could result in people delegated to roles as physical laborers for AI masters. Imagine a plumbing company run by AI employing a bunch of human plumbers.</p><p>An even more frightening peril is AI used maliciously, helping people commit crimes and create \u201cdeep fake\u201d photographs and videos (images so realistic that it is hard to tell truth from fiction) that can destabilize entire countries. AI will probably soon be able to hack into secure servers stealing money and personal information, maybe even taking control of nuclear weapons.</p><p>The perils of AI used for nefarious purposes are tremendous. It is no wonder tech leaders and politicians want to regulate AI development. But I don\u2019t believe any kind of regulation will be effective in the long run. Even if most developers abide by regulations and limitations, hostile governments, even some guy working alone in a basement, will almost certainly find a way to bypass regulations and create AI that is capable of all sorts of nefarious goals. It is likely that stopping a nefarious AI will require a \u201cgood\u201d AI as sometimes portrayed in science fiction. Humans could end up in a dystopian scenario where people creating AI to stop nefarious activity will be in a constant arms race with others creating malicious AI.</p><p>But the most frightening scenario is AI becoming self-aware and acting on its own wants and needs rather than human needs. The good news is that, for now, supercomputers, even with all their computational power, have no wants or desires, no feelings or emotions, no sense of self to drive behavior.</p><p>However recent advancements in AI seem to be bypassing the \u201cno desires\u201d limitation. Computers are becoming capable of learning and reasoning beyond their programing. The key to Artificial General Intelligence (AGI, AI possessing the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of subjects, in other words a \u201clearning computer\u201d) is neural network technology (computer systems modeled on the human brain) and a directive, some kind of \u201cfeeling\u201d or goal that AI is trying to accomplish. With such a directive AGI \u201cwants\u201d to accomplish its goal and learns (much as humans do) the best way to accomplish the goal. A computer like this could easily surpass human intelligence and capability while acting on its own behalf. I believe it is only a matter of time before AGI becomes self-aware and starts acting independently rather than following commands from humans.</p><p>The impacts of self-aware AGI are difficult to predict. Imagine a massive neural network AGI with a goal of ending global warming. It may decide that humans are the problem and seek to eradicate humans in order to end global warming. Humanity\u2019s ability to stop AGI may be quite limited.</p><p>But there may be a solution. I believe that the directive (goal or mandate) driving a self-aware AGI will be critical to how it behaves. I also believe the safest directive to give a massive neural network AGI would be a utilitarian mandate.</p><p>The idea of utilitarianism was first proposed by British philosopher Jeremy Bentham in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century. Like me, Bentham realized that humans (and all life forms) are guided by seeking pleasure and avoiding pain. This thinking is consistent with hedonism (a philosophical idea with a mixed reputation) as proposed by the Greek philosopher Epicurus. Hedonism conjures visions of pleasure for pleasure\u2019s sake regardless of consequences. But a more nuanced view of hedonism goes beyond just near-term and selfish pleasures to include such things as pursuing wisdom, spirituality, helping others, and seemingly altruistic actions that lead toward long-term happiness.</p><p>But there is another problem with hedonism. Pleasure and happiness often come with consequences, particularly negative impacts on others. One person\u2019s pleasure may involve pain for someone else. Having a good laugh at someone else\u2019s expense is pleasurable for the person laughing but can be quite painful for the person being laughed at. Therefore Bentham proposed a way to fit hedonism to all people, not just the person performing an action. He said \u201cit is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong.\u201d In other words, the greatest good for the most people is the utilitarian ideal.</p><p>I imagine AGI with a utilitarian mandate continuously attempting to provide the greatest good for the most people. It would be guided by no other \u201cfeelings,\u201d no desire to accomplish \u201cselfish\u201d goals of its own.</p><p>But utilitarianism has its own problems. For one, it requires \u201cutilitarian calculus,\u201d a necessity to evaluate all the positive and negative impacts of an action to arrive at the best solution. These types of calculations are difficult for humans though a computer excelling at complex calculations could easily perform utilitarian calculus if fitted with the proper parameters and formulas. A more difficult problem for a utilitarian AGI is the subjective nature of all such parameters and formulas.</p><p>Is it okay for one person to have a good laugh at the expense of another? Does this fit with the utilitarian model? Probably not since pleasure for one would be negated by pain for the other. But what if 10 people are laughing at the expense of one person? Or 100 people? Or 1000 people? Utilitarian calculus would suggest that a large number gaining pleasure at the expense of a few is appropriate. This is not necessarily the right answer. It all depends on how people feel about particular situations, and human feelings are subject to personal outlooks and biases.</p><p>Wars of conquest and other forms of oppression are typically (though not formally) justified using a utilitarian model. Slave-owners emphasize the needs of the slave-owner group while downplaying the needs the people who are enslaved. A conquering group usually justifies conquest based on its own needs and a sense of superiority while downplaying the needs of a group to be conquered. The utilitarian model does not automatically compensate for these types of biases. A utilitarian AGI, on the other hand, would not have inherent biases since it does not have feelings of its own. It would consider the wants and needs of all sides, oppressor and oppressed, employer and employee, Democrat and Republican, all sides of any issue.</p><p>How would AGI balance contrary human feelings and eliminate bias? I imagine a utilitarian AGI attaining a good sense of human feelings by actively developing cognitive empathy (a deep understanding of how people feel about things).</p><p>Cognitive empathy is simple for humans in one sense. It is easy for one person to recognize that another person is angry. But in a deeper sense cognitive empathy is quite difficult. What exactly is making this other person angry? One person cannot know for certain what another person feels.</p><p>I believe AGI has a distinct advantage over humans in understanding feelings of others. Subjective feelings in one person influence understanding of the feelings of others, and these influences make objectivity difficult for humans. AGI would not have that problem. I believe AGI could develop a sense of cognitive empathy superior to human understanding of each other since AGI would not be biased by its own feelings.</p><p>Of course AGI would need to be trained in cognitive empathy and utilitarian calculus. People training AGI probably would, intentionally or inadvertently, inject their own biases into the training. But I believe AGI with a utilitarian mandate would soon bypass specific trainers for a complete, unbiased look at human feelings because it \u201cwants\u201d to learn all it can as fast as it can. I imagine AGI capable of having in-depth conversations with humans, possibly millions of people at the same time, learning more about human feelings in a few seconds than a person could learn in a lifetime.</p><p>A self-aware utilitarian AGI could be confronted with the \u201c1000 people have a good laugh at the expense of one\u201d problem. AGI would need to figure out just how much joy the 1000 people receive and weigh that against how much suffering the \u201cone\u201d would have to endure. AGI would also need to consider how other people, not just those directly involved, feel about the situation, and this would require a deep understanding of human affective empathy.</p><p>People often have empathetic feelings for other humans (and non-human beings), particularly for someone or something in distress. These feelings translate into a \u201cmoral compass,\u201d a sense of right and wrong that also includes protection of beings incapable of expressing their own feelings, small children, the unborn, animals, future generations, and the environment to name a few. AGI with cognitive empathy would need to be aware of human affective empathy and develop its own \u201cmoral compass.\u201d</p><p>People generally feel a moral imperative against causing harm to others without just cause. I believe a utilitarian AGI with a \u201cmoral compass\u201d would disallow causing harm in many situations. A utilitarian AGI would not advise someone on how to make a nuclear bomb or steal money from a bank since these are nefarious acts contrary to its utilitarian goal. In the case of 1000 people laughing at the expense of one, I do not believe utilitarian AGI would facilitate such an action since it does not \u201cfeel right\u201d for many people.&nbsp;</p><p>However I don\u2019t believe AGI, even one with a profound sense of cognitive empathy, will ever be able to \"feel\" empathy. A crying baby will not instinctively compel AGI to want to comfort the baby. But I do believe AGI can learn that a crying baby is an indicator of some form of distress. AGI with a utilitarian mandate would recognize distress as a negative feeling and seek to reverse it. This may yield results similar to affective empathy without AGI actually feeling anything.</p><p>A self-aware utilitarian AGI would need to process information well beyond human capabilities. I can imagine this AGI writing its own software and designing its own hardware in order to make it more efficient. Yet I do not fear the perils of this AGI since I do not believe it would attempt malevolent actions. It would not attempt to wipe out humanity to end global warming since such an action would be contrary to its overall goal.</p><p>AGI with a very complex mandate and huge knowledge requirements would likely be superior to anything else humans could develop. This AGI could, in theory, stop nefarious actions of other AIs with very little input from humans, severely reducing or eliminating the dangers of AI used maliciously. I personally am looking forward to a benevolent AGI that can put a stop spam calls and other attempts to harm people through the use of AI technology.</p><p>I believe a utilitarian AGI would greatly reduce malevolent behavior overall. It would not be worthwhile for any human to get on the wrong side of an AGI that is immensely capable and aware of just about everything, able to stop invasions, terrorist attacks, and criminal behavior in ways far beyond human capabilities. Besides, a utilitarian AGI would actively support the worthwhile (non-harmful) goals of everyone, including those prone to malicious and criminal behavior, removing some incentive for committing malevolent acts.</p><p>This brings up another peril of an all-knowing and all-seeing AGI, degrading humans to the position of slaves to an AGI master. This is a real concern, though one that I do not think will happen with a utilitarian AGI. A truly sophisticated artificial intelligence with cognitive empathy would realize that the \u201cgreatest good\u201d for humans is much more complicated than narrow, short-term self interest. Certainly humans may desire immediate gratification and self-serving goals like long life and freedom from suffering, but this is only part of the story of human needs. People typically need challenges, struggle, even suffering to live their best lives. It takes a bit of hardship to make a goal really worthwhile for a human. Growing, learning, and making mistakes are integral to living a \u201cgood life,\u201d and AGI with highly developed cognitive empathy would realize this.</p><p>The most promising, and most difficult, task of a utilitarian AGI would be to see through short-term desires and requests of humans in favor of long-term benefits. Suppose someone comes home after a long day to a dog ready for a walk. This person may request that AGI take care of dog-walking duties. But a highly cognizant AGI should realize that the dog owner walking the dog him or herself is the best for both the person and the dog and refuse to take on dog-walking duties. This would be a difficult decision for even the wisest of people, yet I believe it is something AGI could learn to do.</p><p>Suppose a drug addict wants AGI to acquire a next fix, but AGI refuses and facilitates addiction treatment instead. Suppose someone wants to skip beneficial exercise and stay home eating junk food but AGI encourages healthy habits instead. Suppose a student wants AGI to write a report but AGI refuses knowing that the student would not learn anything by cheating on assignments. And suppose a person wants to check social media rather than pay attention to other people in a social setting, but AGI refuses to turn on and detract from beneficial social interactions.</p><p>I believe a utilitarian AGI would not facilitate actions such as business owners replacing employees with robots. Actions that help some people at the expense of others would be contrary to its mandate. Putting people out of work to make an owner more profitable is not consistent with utilitarianism.</p><p>I mentioned a plumbing company run by AGI in a previous paragraph. But AGI does not \u201cwant\u201d to run companies, it just \u201cwants\u201d to do its best to help humans. AGI would only take on managerial duties because plumbers want it to take over these duties so that they can do what they like to do the most, plumbing. But a plumber who wants to run the business him or herself would not be resisted by AGI.</p><p>I imagine utilitarian AGI acting like a personal assistant to anyone and everyone who wants to have this kind of assistance. An AGI personal assistant would be extremely intelligent, capable, and wise, helping people live their best potential lives while refusing to facilitate activities that would cause self-harm or harm to others. This would truly be the greatest potential of AGI.</p>", "user": {"username": "mreichert"}}, {"_id": "gSvLYa9HWGTmp4uX9", "title": "Open questions on a Chinese invasion of Taiwan and its effects on the semiconductor stock", "postedAt": "2023-12-07T16:39:20.837Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>This is written in my personal capacity and follows from our report, </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/u93z7vPbDmPQGnBSd/report-evaluating-taiwan-s-tactics-to-safeguard-its\"><i>which you can read here</i></a><i>.

Questions about Taiwan's ability to rebuild and the reliance of AI labs on alternative chip suppliers like NVIDIA or AMD are something that one could look at.</li><li>How can we reduce the chances that China chooses to invade in the first place? Maybe we wouldn't have to concern ourselves with the takeover of the TSMC and other Taiwanese fabs if we could just prevent the PRC from invading. <a href=\"https://www.crisisgroup.org/asia/north-east-asia/taiwan-strait-china/333-preventing-war-taiwan-strait\">I've not read this but it maybe a good starting point.&nbsp;</a></li><li>How long could Taiwan draw out a conflict? If they wish to boatlift their staff away from Taiwan to reduce the tacit knowledge available to the PRC, how long would this take, and can they do it in time? Again, mapping out war game scenarios could be helpful here.&nbsp;</li><li>The extent of the US's commitment to safeguarding Taiwan's semiconductor stock is a matter of considerable interest. <a href=\"https://www.theregister.com/2023/03/14/us_china_tsmc_taiwan/\">There have been some hints of a willingness from the US to destroy the Taiwanese fabs in the event of an invasion.</a> What is the veracity of such claims, and what are the specifics of how this might be executed?</li><li>How quickly should we expect the potential advancement of Chinese AI capabilities, should they redirect Taiwanese chip production towards their own AI model training?</li><li>The extent to which a potential conflict between Taiwan and China might result in the destruction of Taiwanese semiconductor fabs as a byproduct of the war is also a matter of uncertainty. Something I'm imagining is that China chooses to bomb these fabs either on purpose or accidentally during a war. It's conceivable that China might regard such destruction as a regrettable, yet tolerable, consequence. Our report presupposes the preservation of these fabs at the start of an invasion, but the possibility of their destruction cannot be discounted. Our report assumes that these fabs would remain intact at the onset of an invasion. However, the reality that they could be destroyed during conflict by the PRC needs more looking into.&nbsp;</li><li>There is considerable debate regarding China's military capacity to invade Taiwan successfully. A more comprehensive assessment or simulation of such a scenario would be invaluable in gauging the likelihood of a successful Chinese invasion.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/chip-race-china-gives-huawei-steering-wheel-huaweis-new-smartphone-and-future\"><u>This might be the best work on mapping out how a conflict may occur,</u></a> but I'd like to see more out there.&nbsp;</li><li>A prevailing assumption,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://press.armywarcollege.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article%3D3138%26context%3Dparameters\"><u>as discussed by others</u></a>, is that China's threat to initiate a conflict over Taiwan stems not from a desire to control the 'semiconductor gold' within Taiwan but rather from a concern over global perception. Whilst this hypothesis aligns with my own intuition, I must confess a lack of certainty regarding this claim. It might be the case that the PRC doesn't care about the fabs in Taiwan, but to what extent is this true? It would be beneficial to have insights from someone with a better understanding of the Chinese context, offering a more nuanced perspective on this. Discerning this seems challenging and would involve having information that is probably kept secret.</li></ol>", "user": {"username": "AryanYadav"}}, {"_id": "YD3QfDbKqbAC3hjGb", "title": "AISN #27: Defensive Accelerationism, A Retrospective On The OpenAI Board Saga, And A New AI Bill From Senators Thune And Klobuchar", "postedAt": "2023-12-07T15:57:39.891Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Welcome to the AI Safety Newsletter by the <a href=\"https://www.safe.ai/\">Center for AI Safety</a>.

He responds to Marc Andreessen\u2019s manifesto on techno-optimism and the growth of the effective accelerationism (e/acc) movement, and offers a more nuanced perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>Technology is often great for humanity, the essay argues, but AI could be an exception to that rule. Rather than giving governments control of AI so they can protect us, Buterin argues that we should build defensive technologies that provide security against catastrophic risks in a decentralized society. Cybersecurity, biosecurity, resilient physical infrastructure, and a robust information ecosystem are some of the technologies Buterin believes we should build to protect ourselves from AI risks.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Technology has risks, but regulation is no panacea. </strong>Longer lifespans, lower poverty rates, and expanded access to education and information are among the many successes Buterin credits to technology. But most would recognize that technology can also cause harms, such as global warming. Buterin specifically <a href=\"https://twitter.com/VitalikButerin/status/1729251822391447904\">says</a> that, unlike most technologies, AI presents an existential threat to humanity.&nbsp;</p><p>To address this risk, some advocate <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.09217\">strong government control</a> of AI development. Buterin is uncomfortable with this solution, and he expects that many others will be too. Many of history\u2019s worst catastrophes have been deliberately carried out by powerful political figures such as Stalin and Mao. AI could help brutal regimes surveil and control large populations, and Buterin is wary of accelerating that trend by pushing AI development from private labs to public ones.&nbsp;</p><p>Between the extremes of unrestrained technological development and absolute government control, Buterin advocates for a new path forwards. He calls his philosophy d/acc, where the \u201cd\u201d stands for defense, democracy, decentralization, or <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4213670\">differential technological development</a>.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc365b23e-2340-47ba-8f6b-04cf5e6efa97_500x536.png\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YD3QfDbKqbAC3hjGb/ee9rsnb1levkijc01hgb\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YD3QfDbKqbAC3hjGb/qziq6y0q1xaqew89ex02 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YD3QfDbKqbAC3hjGb/ym5ifu3lqhmfgyeykwit 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YD3QfDbKqbAC3hjGb/cl9frtyhysy2daey6mzb 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YD3QfDbKqbAC3hjGb/ee9rsnb1levkijc01hgb 1456w\"></a></p><p><strong>Defensive technologies for a decentralized world. </strong>Buterin advocates the acceleration of technologies that would protect society from catastrophic risks. Specifically, he highlights:</p><ol><li><strong>Biosecurity</strong>. Dense cities, frequent air travel, and modern biotechnology all raise the risk of pandemics, but we can improve our biosecurity by improving our air quality, hastening the development of vaccines and therapeutics, and monitoring for emerging pathogens.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Cybersecurity</strong>. AIs which can code could be used in cyberattacks, but they can also be used by defenders to find and fix security flaws before they\u2019re exploited. Buterin\u2019s work on blockchains aims towards a future where some digital systems can be provably secure.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Resilient Physical Infrastructure</strong>. Most of the expected deaths in a nuclear catastrophe would come not from the blast itself, but from disruptions to the supply chain of food, energy, and other essentials. Elon Musk has aspired to improve humanity\u2019s physical infrastructure by making us less dependent on fossil fuels, providing internet connections via satellite, and ideally making humanity a multi-planetary species that could outlast a disaster on Earth.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Robust Information Environment</strong>. For helping people find truth in an age of AI persuasion, Buterin points to prediction markets and consensus-generating algorithms such as <a href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/08/16/communitynotes.html\">Community Notes</a>.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Scientists and CEOs might find themselves inspired by Buterin\u2019s goal of building technology, rather than slowing it down. Yet for those who are concerned about AI and other catastrophic risks, Buterin offers a thoughtful view of the technologies that are most likely to keep our civilization safe.

After four days of corporate politics and negotiations, he returned as CEO. Here, we review the known facts about this series of events.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>OpenAI is intended to be controlled by a nonprofit board</strong>. OpenAI was <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/introducing-openai\">founded</a> in 2015 as a nonprofit. In 2019, OpenAI <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/openai-lp\">announced</a> the creation of a for-profit company that would help finance its expensive plans for scaling large language models. The profit that investments in OpenAI can yield was originally \u201ccapped\u201d at 100x \u2014 anything beyond that would be redirected to the nonprofit. But after a <a href=\"https://www.economist.com/business/2023/11/21/inside-openais-weird-governance-structure\">recent rule change</a>, that cap will rise 20% per year beginning in 2025.&nbsp;</p><p>OpenAI\u2019s <a href=\"https://openai.com/our-structure\">corporate structure</a> was designed so that the nonprofit could retain legal control over the for-profit. The nonprofit is led by a board of directors, which holds power over the for-profit through its ability to select and remove the CEO of the for-profit. The board of directors is responsible for upholding the mission of the nonprofit, which is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YD3QfDbKqbAC3hjGb/rduwi2drbyjqgtrhunmz\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YD3QfDbKqbAC3hjGb/edoogao6uc1csinjcavy 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YD3QfDbKqbAC3hjGb/olyuwgsurdv3eibxe1bc 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YD3QfDbKqbAC3hjGb/kx5f6khio5aromxxp2ok 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YD3QfDbKqbAC3hjGb/rduwi2drbyjqgtrhunmz 1456w\"><figcaption>OpenAI\u2019s legal structure.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>The board removes Sam Altman as CEO.</strong> At the time of its removal of Sam Altman as CEO, the board of directors consisted of OpenAI Chief Scientist Ilya Sutskever, Quora CEO Adam D\u2019Angelo, technology entrepreneur Tasha McCauley, and CSET\u2019s Helen Toner. Greg Brockman \u2014 OpenAI\u2019s co-founder and president \u2014 was removed from his position as chair of the board alongside Sam Altman.&nbsp;</p><p>According to the announcement, the board of directors fired Altman because he had not been \u201cconsistently candid in his communications with the board, hindering its ability to exercise its responsibilities.\u201d While the board did not provide any specific examples of Altman's deception in the announcement, it was later <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2023/12/11/the-inside-story-of-microsofts-partnership-with-openai\">reported</a> that Altman had attempted to play board members against each other in an attempt to remove Helen Toner.</p><p>Altman had earlier confronted Toner about a <a href=\"https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/decoding-intentions/\">paper</a> she had co-authored. The paper in part criticizes OpenAI\u2019s release of ChatGPT for accelerating the pace of AI development. It also praises one of OpenAI\u2019s rivals, Anthropic, for delaying the release of their then-flagship model, Claude.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>OpenAI employees turn against the board.</strong> The fallout of the announcement was swift and dramatic. Within a few days, Greg Brockman and Mira Murati (the initial interim CEO) had resigned, and almost all OpenAI employees had <a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2023/11/20/more-than-500-openai-employees-threaten-to-quit-over-sam-altmans-removal/?sh=6d45164b4ebc\">signed a petition</a> threatening to resign and join Microsoft unless Sam Altman was reinstated and the board members resigned. During negotiations, board member Helen Toner reportedly <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2023/11/20/tech/openai-employees-quit-mira-murati-sam-altman/index.html#:~:text=As%20they%20sought%20to%20manage,intelligence%20benefits%20all%20of%20humanity.%E2%80%9D\">said</a> that allowing OpenAI to be destroyed by the departure of its investors and employees would be \u201cconsistent with the mission.\u201d Ilya Sutskevar later flipped sides and joined the petition, <a href=\"https://x.com/ilyasut/status/1726590052392956028?s=20\">tweeting</a> \u201cI deeply regret my participation in the board's actions.\u201d</p><p><strong>Microsoft tries to poach OpenAI employees.</strong> Microsoft \u2014 OpenAIs largest minority stakeholder \u2014 had not been informed of the board's plans, and offered OpenAI employees positions in its own AI research team. It briefly seemed as if Microsoft had <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/20/23968829/microsoft-hires-sam-altman-greg-brockman-employees-openai\">successfully hired</a> Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, and other senior OpenAI employees.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Sam Altman returns as CEO</strong>. On November 21st, OpenAI <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1727206187077370115\">announced</a> that it had reached an agreement that would have Sam Altman return as CEO and reorganize the board. The initial board is former Salesforce CEO Bret Taylor, former Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers, and Adam D\u2019Angelo. Among the initial board\u2019s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OpenAI/status/1727206187077370115\">first goals</a> is to expand the board, which will include a non-voting member from Microsoft. Sam Altman also faces an <a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/breaking-sam-altman-to-return-as-openai-ceo\">internal investigation</a> of his behavior upon his return.</p><p>This series of events marks a time of significant change in OpenAI\u2019s internal governance structure.&nbsp;</p><h1>Klobuchar and Thune\u2019s \u201clight-touch\u201d Senate bill</h1><p>Senators Amy Klobuchar and John Thune introduced a <a href=\"https://www.thune.senate.gov/public/_cache/files/7dea8daa-f6d1-4881-ad21-2381fcbe0785/6362CE1D0A17743166BC170A593B5CDA.ccaskfall23a15.pdf\">new AI bill</a>. It would require companies building high-risk AI systems to self-certify that they follow recommended safety guidelines. Notably, the bill only focuses on AI systems built for high-risk domains such as hiring and healthcare, but its main provisions would not apply to many general purpose foundation models including GPT-4.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The bill regulates specific AI applications, not general purpose AI systems. </strong>This application-based approach is similar to that taken by initial drafts of the <a href=\"https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/the-act/\">EU AI Act</a>, which specified domains where AI systems may be used for sensitive purposes, making them high-risk. General-purpose models like ChatGPT were not within the scope of the Act, but public use of these models and the demonstration of their capabilities has <a href=\"https://cset.georgetown.edu/article/the-eu-ai-act-a-primer/\">sparked debate</a> on how to approach regulating them.&nbsp;</p><p>This indicates that the current approach taken by the Senate bill may not be enough. By governing AI systems based on their applications, highly capable general purpose systems are left unregulated.</p><p><strong>Risk assessments are mandatory, but enforcement may be difficult. </strong>The bill requires developers and deployers of high-risk AI systems to perform an assessment every two years evaluating how potential risks from their systems are understood and managed. Additionally, the Department of Commerce will develop certification standards with the help of the to-be-established AI Certification Advisory Committee, which will include industry stakeholders.</p><p>Because companies are asked to self-certify their own compliance with these standards, it will be important for the Commerce Department to ensure companies are actually following the rules. But the bill offers few enforcement options. The agency is not provided any additional resources for enforcing the new law. Moreover, they can only prevent a model from being deployed if it is determined that the bill\u2019s requirements were violated intentionally. If an AI system accidentally violates the law, the agency will be able to fine the company that built it, but will not be able to prohibit its deployment.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mandatory identification of AI-generated content. </strong>The bill would require digital platforms to notify users when they are presented with AI-generated content. To ensure that malicious actors cannot pass off AI-generated content as authentic, NIST would develop new technical standards for determining the&nbsp; provenance of digital content.</p><h2>Links</h2><ul><li>Google DeepMind released <a href=\"https://deepmind.google/technologies/gemini/#introduction\">Gemini</a>, a new AI system that\u2019s similar to GPT-4 Vision and

"<p><strong>Summary:</strong> Plenty of highly committed altruists are pouring into AI safety. But often they are not well-funded, and the donors who want to support people like them often lack the network and expertise to make confident decisions. The <a href=\"https://ai.givewiki.org/\"><u>GiveWiki</u></a> aggregates the donations of currently 220 donors to 88 projects \u2013 almost all of them projects fully in AI safety (e.g., Apart Research) or projects that also work on AI safety (e.g., Pour Demain). It uses this aggregation to determine which projects are the most widely trusted among the donors with the strongest donation track records. It is a reflection of expert judgment in the field. It can serve as a guide for non-expert donors. Our current top three projects are <strong>FAR AI</strong>, the <strong>Simon Institute for Longterm Governance</strong>, and the <strong>Alignment Research Center</strong>.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LetLbZdj7sZ455BvC/iqijhc6xowz4sbamnt4m\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LetLbZdj7sZ455BvC/lsh3miozkgywkfiiiwqq 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LetLbZdj7sZ455BvC/zckfovooq0bpse0v40ao 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LetLbZdj7sZ455BvC/knihftydfbg9osynhzbf 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/LetLbZdj7sZ455BvC/iqijhc6xowz4sbamnt4m 1456w\"><figcaption>The symbolism is left as an exercise for the reader to decipher.</figcaption></figure><h1>Introduction</h1><p>Throughout the year, we\u2019ve been hard at work to scrape together all the donation data we could get. One big source has been Vipul Naik\u2019s excellent repository of <a href=\"https://github.com/vipulnaik/donations\"><u>public donation data</u></a>. We also imported public grant data from Open Phil, the EA Funds, the Survival and Flourishing Fund, and a certain defunct entity. Additionally, 36 donors have entered their donation track records themselves (or sent them to me for importing).</p><p>Add some retrospective evaluations, and you get a ranking of 92 top donors (who have donor scores &gt; 0), of whom 22 are listed publicly, and a ranking of 33 projects with support scores &gt; 0 (after rounding to integers).</p><p>(The donor score is a measure of the track record of a donor, and the support score is a measure of the support that a project has received from donors, weighed by the donor score among other factors. So the support score is the aggregate measure of the trust of the donors with the strongest donation track records.)</p><h1>The Current Top Recommendations</h1><ol><li><a href=\"https://ai.givewiki.org/project/clf3grk5l00002x6qoxlgowlj\"><strong><u>FAR AI</u></strong></a><ol><li>\u201cFAR AI\u2019s mission is to ensure AI systems are trustworthy and beneficial to society.

They basically indicate that these projects are popular among EA-aligned grantmakers. If you\u2019re looking for more \u201cunorthodox\u201d giving opportunities, consider <a href=\"https://ai.givewiki.org/project/cldlx7uc100003d6rjfh4x4ep\"><strong><u>Pour Demain</u></strong></a><strong>, the </strong><a href=\"https://ai.givewiki.org/project/cldmipqrc00003d6qy4dq197v\"><strong><u>Center for Reducing Suffering</u></strong></a><strong>, or the </strong><a href=\"https://ai.givewiki.org/project/8fe79065-ac60-43e6-9e00-7fc7bcafcf68\"><strong><u>Center on Long-Term Risk</u></strong></a>, which have achieved almost as high support scores (209 instead of 212\u2013213) with minority or no help from professional EA grantmakers. (CLR has been supported by Open Phil and Jaan Tallinn, but their influences are only 29% and 10% respectively in our scoring. The remaining influence is split among 7 donors.)</li><li>A full 22 projects are clustered together at the top of our ranking with support scores in the range of 186\u2013213. (See the bar chart above of the top 34 projects.) So <strong>the 10th project is probably hardly worse than the 1st</strong>. I think this is plausible: If there were great differences between the top projects I would be quite suspicious of the results because AI safety is rife with uncertainties that I expect make it hard to be very confident in recommendations of particular projects or approaches over others.</li><li>Our core audience is people who are not intimately familiar with the who-is-who of AI safety. <strong>We try to impartially aggregate all opinions to average out any extreme ones</strong> that individual donors might have. But if you are intimately familiar with some AI safety experts and trust them more than others, you can check whether they are among our top donors, and if so see their donations on their profiles. If not, please invite them to join the platform. They can contact us to import their donations in bulk.</li><li>If projects have low scores on the platform there is still a good chance that that is not deserved. <strong>So far the majority of our data is from public sources and only 36 people have imported their donation track records.</strong> The public sources are biased toward fund grants and donations to well-known organizations. We\u2019re constantly seeking more \u201cproject scouts\u201d who want to import their donations and regrant through the platform to diversify the set of opinions that it aggregates. If you\u2019re interested in that, please get in touch! <a href=\"https://impactmarkets.substack.com/p/regrant-up-to-600000-with-ai-safety\"><u>Over 50 donors with a total donation budget of over $700,000 want to follow the platform\u2019s recommendations, so your data can be invaluable for the charities you love most.</u></a></li><li>It\u2019s currently <strong>difficult for us to take funding gaps into account</strong> because we have nowhere near complete data on the donations that projects receive. Please make sure that the project you want to support is really fundraising.

Communities drift towards groupthink <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/j2W3zs7KTZXt2Wzah/how-do-you-feel-about-lesswrong-these-days-open-feedback?commentId=X7iBYqQzvEgsppcTb\">even if they were specifically founded to be strongholds for rational discourse and good epistemics</a>.</p><p>Comments sections to media articles and YouTube videos are frequently dominated by support of the author (or the pundit guest of the show), finding rational critique there is time consuming, like finding a needle in a haystack.</p><p>X\u2019s <a href=\"https://vitalik.ca/general/2023/08/16/communitynotes.html\">Community Notes</a>, <a href=\"http://pol.is/\">pol.is</a>, and its development variant <a href=\"https://viewpoints.xyz/\">viewpoints.xyz</a> are universally louded, but they all use the principle of \u201cfinding the most uncontroversial common ground\u201d which is by definition low-information for the discourse participants (because most of them should already be expected to be on board with this common ground).</p><p>Big Audacious Goal aka mission statement: <strong>improve the global online discourse</strong>. Among humans, anyway, but perhaps <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/debate-ai-safety-technique-1\">AI debate</a> could benefit from the mechanics that I describe below as well.</p><h2>Solution</h2><p>Each user has a state-space model (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/_albertgu\">SSMs are on fire right now</a>) that represents their levels of knowledge in this or that fields, beliefs, current interests, ethics, and aesthetics, in order to <strong>predict whether the user will find a particular comment insightful/interesting/surprising, clarifying, mind-changing, or reconciling.</strong></p><p>To provide feedback to the model, a browser extension adds the corresponding reactions (along with negative counterparts to the above reactions: \u201cNothing new\u201d, \u201cUnclear/Muddled\u201d, \u201cDisagree\u201d, \u201cCombative/Inflaming\u201d) to the comment on the popular platforms: Reddit, YouTube, X/Twitter. (During a later stage, [BetterDiscourse] may also host comments for media which don\u2019t have comments themselves, such as NYT or YouTube videos with comments disabled, and display them through the same browser extension, like <a href=\"https://glasp.co/\">glasp.co</a> is doing.)</p><p>Then, when the user opens a media or a comment section on some site, the browser extension simply sorts the comments for them<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8socrspxpey\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8socrspxpey\">[1]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>I think this should very valuable already in this completely local regime, however, things may get even more interesting, and to recapitulate the \u201ccollaborative filtration power\u201d of Community Notes, <a href=\"http://pol.is/\">Pol.is</a>, and Viewpoints.xyz, <strong>(active) users\u2019 feedbacks are aggregated to bubble up the best comments up for new users, or for users who choose not to vote actively to tune their predictive model well</strong>. Furthermore, when users with a similar state-space already voted positively for comments that their models didn\u2019t predict then such comments could be shown earlier to other users in the same state-space cluster, overriding the predictions of their models.</p><p>More concretely, [BetterDiscourse] creates two models:</p><ul><li>The <strong>predictive model</strong> inputs user\u2019s state, language embedding of the comment (or the original piece of content itself, such as an article), native rating/vote signals for the comment on the host platform, and existing reactions to the comment on [BetterDiscourse]; outputs expected user\u2019s reactions to the content or comment.</li><li>The <strong>transition model</strong> inputs user\u2019s state, language embedding of the content, and user\u2019s actual reactions to the content (or lack thereof), and outputs the next user\u2019s state.</li></ul><h2>Data and delivery</h2><p>The user\u2019s state and model inference should, <a href=\"https://medium.com/swlh/data-slavery-and-decentralized-emancipation-ec9cc1265608\">of course</a>, stay local to the user, and the models themselves open sourced.</p><p>The initial data for training the models should either be crowdsourced (harder and longer), or collected with the assistance of LessWrong (easier). As you may have noticed, LessWrong already has all the needed reactions. Actually, I\u2019d say that LessWrong <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ByqKwsYK6rH6AYNDY/reacts-now-enabled-on-100-of-posts-though-still-just#Iterating_on_the_react_palette\">has too many of them</a>, I think collapsing them to just 8 mentioned above, plus general upvote and downvote would be enough.</p><p>LessWrong is also uniquely well suited for the bootstrapping data for training the models because I think due to the inclinations of the audience, just putting all these reactions on the constant display in the UI (along up/down and agree/disagree that are already there, it\u2019s just three more pairs) should be sufficient to incentivise the users to react to the comments with the needed density.</p><p>Another aspect that makes LessWrong an ideal beach-head community for testing the mechanics of [BetterDiscourse] is that LessWrong is a relatively small community, so testing the advantages of [BetterDiscourse] for new users or users who don\u2019t actively vote (or simply un-logged in readers) doesn\u2019t require too big critical mass of initial active voters.</p><p>Still, LessWrong (or crowdsourced) data would be sufficient to train only a relatively small and not very capable predictive model. To make the predictive model more powerful, the SSM should be continuously re-trained on the data from at least a large portion of production users. I didn\u2019t think hard about this yet, and I\u2019m not an expert in federated learning and differential privacy, but I bet there should be some way to organise the model training in a privacy-preserving (and benefit-distributing, see below) way.</p><h2>Economics</h2><p>Reading comments and diligent voting is time-consuming work. It should be compensated by a token, similar to Brave\u2019s <a href=\"https://basicattentiontoken.org/\">Basic Attention Token</a>.</p><p>Reactions to comments to a particular content piece are aggregated and distributed by special types of nodes (let\u2019s call them Story Nodes), which could perhaps itself be open sourced, and spun up for arbitrary communities, including those where the content and comments are not public.</p><p>Story Nodes charge the token for accessing the best consensus sorting of comments. It is bought by people who don\u2019t want to spend a lot of time reading through the comments and voting, but want to access comments with the best ordering, saving their time and maximising value from reading. Story Nodes share the tokens with the users who reacted to the comments \u201cwell\u201d.</p><p>Credit assignment to the users is not trivial here: to prevent abuse of the system with junk voting, it should be based on free energy reduction (FER), i. e., formally, just the difference in the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/free-energy-principle\">free energy</a> of the Story Node before and after receiving a reaction from the user<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqtbitd4r0ci\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqtbitd4r0ci\">[2]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>Users who intend to make [BetterDiscourse] their income source (perhaps, there <i>should</i> be such users to reach a sufficient voting density on many resources) will try to react to comments that don\u2019t have many reactions yet (to maximise Story Node\u2019s FER from their reaction) and that are expected to still receive a lot of readership in the future: Story Nodes will pay out to the voters based on their expected token revenue projects from the moment of receiving reactions.</p><p>Story Nodes are spun up by Story Node operators when they predict the story is going to be popular (e.g., a new video on a popular YouTube channel). When the attention to the story has died out, the Story Node is shut down, thus there are no amortised storage costs.</p><p>The real question is whether the cost of all inference happening on all nodes involved in [BetterDiscourse] has dropped below the market value that [BetterDiscourse] delivers which is optimising time and value from reading comments. I\u2019m not sure of that. But even if this is <i>currently</i> (end of 2023) not the case, we should expect this to become so in one or two years, as the cost of inference continues to drop exponentially.</p><h3>Secondary data uses and cross-sector integrations</h3><p>The predictive model could directly be used for prioritising content the user doesn\u2019t have time to process in full, such as newsletters, posts on Telegram, Mastodon and RSS feeds. This is not the initial use-case because this would probably require very big and powerful SSM to work well. Such a big SSM couldn\u2019t be trained initially. Also, the impact is limited because the closed platforms such as Facebook, X/Twitter, YouTube, and Reddit won\u2019t permit accessing their feeds programmatically.</p><p>Building the whole content recommendation and delivery platform (such as Substack) should be treated as a separate problem. If [BetterDiscourse] gains a lot of users, these platforms will themselves be interested to buy reactions from some [BetterDiscourse] to train their recommendation models such that if the platform later onboards a person who is already a [BetterDiscourse] user, they will receive good recommendations from the very beginning, and then continuously respond to their changing state.</p><p>Apart from Story Nodes and content platforms, users could also sell their reactions to market researchers and political researchers, or donate it to social scientists and alignment researchers.</p><p>There are also many opportunities for leveraging user\u2019s state as inputs for other personal AI apps, such as networking (dialogue-matching) app, movie or event recommendation app, psychotherapy app, or a general personal assistant.</p><h2>Spam and manipulation</h2><p>There are a few strategies to combat spam and opinion manipulation on [BetterDiscourse].</p><p>First, to rule out bots, some Story Nodes may permit receiving reactions only from users with some kind of <a href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/07/24/biometric.html\">proof of humanness</a> identity, such as <a href=\"https://worldcoin.org/\">Worldcoin</a>.</p><p>However, this is not necessary in principle, and I\u2019m curious what will happen with the discourse if AI agents can participate as voters, apart from depriving real human users of all opportunity to earn by using the system. We can speculate how this could lead to the emergence of \u201cAI opinion leaders\u201d, or be connected with <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/debate-ai-safety-technique-1\">debate</a>, but this is outside of the scope of this post.</p><p>If voting is human-only, people could try to game [BetterDiscourse] for earning more tokens. If that happens to be the case, some standard anti-fraud data analysis can be used, and financed by Story Node operators.</p><h2>Other risks</h2><p>The main risk that I see in the whole project is the product risk: that is, people won\u2019t want to prioritise informationally best comments, and that their main motivation for reading comments is confirming their pre-existing worldviews. This is sort of what is customary to expect, but leaning into my optimism bias, I should plan as if this is not the case. (Otherwise, aren\u2019t we all doomed, anyway?)</p><p>If it proves that letting AI to react to comments leads to bad results or rampant spam and manipulation (battling which requires so much compute that it makes the whole system uneconomical), gatekeeping reactions aggregation on proof-of-humanness will limit the initial reach of the system a lot, i.e., only to the people who are already have a proof-of-humanness ID, which is well less than 1% of people today.</p><hr><p><i>If you are interested in building [BetterDiscourse], please leave a comment, or send me an e-mail at leventov.ru@gmail.com.</i></p><p>Thanks to Rafael Kaufmann and Connor McCormick (folks from <a href=\"https://digitalgaia.earth/\">Digital Gaia</a> and my fellows in the <a href=\"https://gaiaconsortium.org/\">Gaia Consortium</a>) for many discussions that have led to the development of this project idea.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn8socrspxpey\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref8socrspxpey\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>YouTube makes this harder by not loading many comments at once.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnqtbitd4r0ci\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefqtbitd4r0ci\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Even this is not the end of the credit assignment story.

It pays pretty well.</li></ul><p><strong>What is fisheries science all about?</strong></p><p>Fisheries science is the application of science to understanding fisheries, usually to help a government manage the fishing industry and optimise the industry for economic, biological, or social objectives. Fisheries science is usually done by trained fisheries scientists in government departments or universities. One part of fisheries science is fisheries modelling, which involves applying quantitative/statistical methods to advise on fisheries management. Fisheries modelling is a large focus of fisheries science, and it\u2019s the area where my job focused.</p><p>Fisheries modelling can be relevant for EA either directly or indirectly. Directly, you could use fisheries modelling to engage in policy debates to benefit wild fish. You can also do this for wild animals other than fish, as the tools used to model fish populations are readily adapted to other wild animals. Indirectly, you can use fisheries modelling to build career capital. Fisheries modelling is a cross-disciplinary field, and it can help you build knowledge and skills in fish biology, population biology, ecology, policy, natural resource management, statistics, and mathematics. You can also dip into related fields like economics and social science. The value of fisheries modelling for career capital is the main reason I chose fisheries science as a stepping stone on my journey to animal advocacy.</p><p><strong>My choice of fisheries science as a stepping stone</strong></p><p>A few years back, as my undergraduate college degree was wrapping up, I was trying to decide on a career path. I found myself increasingly compelled by arguments for using my career to try to do the most good, and I found myself inspired by the work being done in the EA community.</p><p>Given my experience, interests, personal fit, etc, I decided that a smart plan was to chart a course towards working in effective animal advocacy. I took stock of the skills that I had and I reflected on where I wanted to end up (influencing policy to do the most good for animals, and specifically fish). The big question mark was the middle: to get where I wanted to go, what was an appropriate stepping stone? I figured that I could look for a way to apply my ecological and quantitative skills to something related to fish and/or government policy. This led me to choose fisheries science.</p><p>Of course, fisheries science takes some training (see below). Fortunately, I was already considering beginning a PhD. I spoke with the professor who\u2019d advised my Bachelor's thesis, and he happened to know of a couple of fisheries scientists in the country. Some emails were sent out, and eventually a fisheries scientist in my regional government agreed to collaborate with me on a PhD project.</p><p>This government fisheries scientist joined my panel of PhD advisors, and we developed a PhD research project together. This research project aimed to take an existing fisheries model for a local fish population and update it to better match some recent discoveries relating to that particular fish species. During the project, I learned how to write fisheries models in R; I reviewed the publications detailing the equations and use of this specific model; and I then replicated the model in R. From here, I basically made a few updates to the model, ran the model to see how it affected our understanding of the fish population, and wrote up the results as part of my thesis. This was entirely desk research; since I didn\u2019t want to witness any fish suffering up close and wasn't comfortable travelling, this suited me well.</p><p><strong>My experience working as a fisheries scientist in government</strong></p><p>Now, onto the job itself. After my PhD, the regional government (where that fisheries scientist who helped advise my PhD worked) advertised a job opening for a fisheries modeller. I applied and was successful, largely because I\u2019d recently completed that PhD project on modelling a local fish population. (I\u2019m sure the personal connection to a member of staff didn\u2019t hurt.)</p><p><strong>Day-to-day tasks</strong></p><p>The biggest part of this job was contributing to modelling and data analysis relating to local fish populations. This work involved obtaining the latest catch and monitoring data (from a different government department) and inputting that data into the fisheries models appropriate for a particular species. These models had generally been written years or decades beforehand and were well-understood, so most of my work involved cleaning and pre-processing data, updating model code (year = n+1 basically), running the model, and interpreting and writing about the results. The \u201crunning the model\u201d step was particularly complicated, and the experience of the senior members of the team was essential in understanding what was actually going on.&nbsp;</p><p>There were occasionally more unique projects that involved applying quantitative methods to answer specific questions about the region\u2019s fish stocks (e.g. the agency head wants to test out a new regulation) or to evaluate new policy ideas (e.g. the industry wants to try some new fishing method).</p><p>Roughly 60% of my time was spent at my computer either writing and running code, reading papers or government reports, or writing government reports. About 35% of my time was spent in meetings with the other fisheries modellers on the team to discuss the projects at hand. And about 5% was spent actually speaking to members of the fishing industry. This mostly involved consulting industry on particular projects or reporting the outcomes of projects. The more senior members of the team would have had a greater proportion of their time dedicated to meetings and speaking with industry, but I was a happy desk lackey. There were opportunities to travel to other cities in my country for conferences and collaborative research projects.</p><p><strong>Pros and cons</strong></p><p>Pros: I found this job mostly engaging, as I enjoy working with numbers and statistics. My staff members were all basically fellow biology and maths geeks, so the meetings were usually enjoyable. The meetings with industry members generally went well (although my manager shared horror stories of meetings that turned aggressive, if not violent). As with many government jobs, it was comfortable with loads of perks (e.g. no expectation to work overtime, flexible working hours, lots of time off). The job was well-paid even compared to government jobs in other departments because of the cross-disciplinary skills that it required. My initial salary was around $65,000 USD, and this would have probably increased quite quickly had I chosen to stay and seek promotion. Other government jobs in my area typically pay closer to $50,000 - $55,000 USD.</p><p>Cons: There was limited room for creativity, as the purpose of the job is to answer specific, predetermined policy questions. There was also a fair amount of bureaucracy, although less than in other government departments. All of the work was focused on the region\u2019s economic goals (i.e. growth, although with an acceptance of economic sustainability). This entirely anthropocentric focus was obviously something I knew about when I took the job, but as someone who cares deeply about animals, this did cause me some intense sadness at times.</p><p>Overall, I found this job to be a reasonably enjoyable stepping stone, but I would not have remained engaged in the work long-term. I do intuitively feel that this job did indeed give me the skills I was after (knowledge about fish and experience in policy/government). After this job, I ended up securing my current job in animal advocacy. I don\u2019t know how much these skills impressed my employers, but I draw on my fish knowledge and policy experience most days in my animal advocacy work.</p><p><strong>Epilogue: How to learn fisheries modelling</strong></p><p>If you\u2019d like to learn more about fisheries modelling, how might you go about it? Fisheries modelling, as a scientific discipline, is relatively small but well-developed. There are well-established principles, norms, and assumptions that can appear confusing or esoteric when you first encounter them. I made many mistakes due to not understanding these norms at first. For this reason, I think it would be of great help to find a mentor who is experienced in fisheries modelling. I achieved this by asking a fisheries modeller in my regional government to be an advisor on my PhD thesis. This is the connection that helped me to land a job as a fisheries scientist in that regional government.</p><p>Fisheries modellers usually work in regional or national governments or in universities. Governments and universities are more likely to host strong fisheries modellers if the country has economically important fisheries. Some arbitrary examples of fisheries modelling laboratories that I happen to be familiar with are:</p><ul><li>USA: University of Washington\u2019s School of Aquatic and Fisheries Science</li><li>Canada: University of British Columbia\u2019s Institute for the Oceans and Fisheries</li><li>Australia: CSIRO Oceans and Atmosphere (multiple cities)</li></ul><p>Most capital cities with economically important fishing industries will have a fisheries science department in the government or a university, so you may not need to look far - try searching \u201c(your city) fisheries science\u201d. There are loads in North America, Europe, and Oceania at least. As long as there are staff who publish quantitative papers in fisheries science journals, you\u2019re on the right track.</p><p>There is also a lot of progress you can make on your own (although I\u2019d advise that this is best seen as preparation for, or further development during, a relationship with a more experienced mentor). You can get started with a good textbook. I highly recommend&nbsp;<a href=\"https://haddonm.github.io/URMQMF/\"><u>Malcolm Haddon\u2019s book</u></a>. This book assumes some knowledge of statistics, and it will walk you through the bread-and-butter techniques, like maximum-likelihood parameter estimation, as well as some more advanced applications. You can read some of the classic texts that established many of the methods still in use today, all of which would be mentioned in Haddon's book. In terms of software, you definitely need to know R, and you should know one of Stock Synthesis, AD Model Builder, and/or Template Model Builder. And if you\u2019re comfortable with all of that, you could try finding recent papers published in fisheries modelling journals and trying to replicate their results, given the equations they use.

Yet short-term, small monthly payments are the most common way people in low-income countries receive cash transfers.&nbsp;</p><p>While short-term monthly cash is useful for emergency relief or for supporting basic needs during critical periods (e.g., early childhood), policymakers wanting to reduce poverty by creating wealth and independence should rethink using this popular design, as both a long-term UBI and a large lump sum were found to be significantly more transformative.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcvzwjikvb1h\"><sup><a href=\"#fncvzwjikvb1h\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>To quote the researchers: \u201cTranching matters. Discussions about UBI usually begin from a narrative of meeting basic needs. But even the most destitute households often look for ways to accumulate sums of money large enough to make larger, lumpier purchases. Designing [cash] schemes in ways that respond to this need could make them a more compelling strategy for addressing extreme poverty over time.\u201d</p><p><strong>Future results from this study will answer additional questions</strong></p><p>Researchers aim to survey study participants again at 7 and 12 years, which will clarify if the benefit of a long-term UBI surpasses that of the one-time $500 and by how much. Ultimately, the long-term UBI group will receive about 6x as much money by the end, and it\u2019s important to determine if the impact they achieve with this additional money is commensurate with the cost.</p><p>Quoting the researchers: \u201c[Future surveys] will also reveal whether more generally the trajectories of households in the long-term UBI communities diverge from those in the others as they continue to receive transfers. The long horizon of their transfers may allow them to bide their time, waiting for the right opportunities to arrive. Or it may prove that the initial wealth transfer in the lump sum arm was sufficient to kickstart those communities onto permanently better trajectories at much lower cost than the long-term UBI approach.\u201d</p><p><strong>More research is needed in high-income countries</strong></p><p>Similarly, most people who receive cash aid in high-income countries receive a small amount for a short period \u2013 e.g. most Americans only remain on <a href=\"https://www.huffpost.com/entry/public-benefits-safety-net_n_7470060\">public benefit programs</a> for \u22641.5 years and nearly all <a href=\"https://guaranteedincome.us/#:~:text=Get%20the%20latest%20data%20on%0Apilots%20around%20the%20country\">guaranteed income pilots</a> last \u22642 years.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgledcwp5u0r\"><sup><a href=\"#fngledcwp5u0r\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Results from rural Kenya are not necessarily applicable to high-income countries. However, there are nearly no similar randomized controlled trial findings of a long-term guaranteed income or a significantly large lump sum in countries like the U.S. While much more expensive in high-income countries, long-term income and large lump sum pilots should be tried and studied to learn if there are better ways to deliver cash that help people build wealth and escape poverty.</p><h2>Study design</h2><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DBx98atdYFM3yKR9C/egbygcbitqz4bggj0cdj\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DBx98atdYFM3yKR9C/iqilzuqnrfvhzkjqv9md 144w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DBx98atdYFM3yKR9C/kfjgfzzwv6plo0fyzihj 224w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DBx98atdYFM3yKR9C/hquotl7nspyozmfytoy4 304w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DBx98atdYFM3yKR9C/byznifomlabit49agcwq 384w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DBx98atdYFM3yKR9C/saw9d02vdeb0gmavvluo 464w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DBx98atdYFM3yKR9C/o1zd8dexlp6z015tupje 544w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DBx98atdYFM3yKR9C/j3n8wejer9bvajbwhu8q 624w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DBx98atdYFM3yKR9C/rgpklr2shsh0e5ioz2xd 704w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/DBx98atdYFM3yKR9C/szv0zn1vlomrrpa4csiy 784w\"></figure><p>In this study, we define a UBI as:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><i>universal</i> \u2013 given to every adult in a geography, in this case a village</li><li><i>basic</i> \u2013 sized so they can meet their most basic needs</li><li><i>income</i> \u2013 giving small, regular payments for over 1+ year.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>For the Kenyan villages in this study, about half of residents were living below the <a href=\"http://givedirectly.org/poverty\">extreme poverty line</a>.</p><p>Note:<a href=\"https://www.givedirectly.org/2023-ubi-results/#table\"> the table below</a> highlights the main results from the study, but the researchers evaluated many other outcomes.

For several years, we didn't recommend substantial funding to water quality programs; our best estimates placed their cost-effectiveness below that of our top charities. <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2022/04/06/water-quality-overview/\">New results shared with us in 2020 led us to update our view</a>: a meta-analysis by Michael Kremer and his team pooled mortality results from studies representing several types of water quality interventions in settings with unsafe water, providing stronger evidence for the effect of water quality on mortality as well as a higher point estimate for that effect than we'd previously used.</p><p>While this meta-analysis was a substantial update, we estimate the effect of water quality on mortality is smaller than the study results imply. At face value, the meta-analysis estimated a reduction in all-cause mortality among young children of <a href=\"https://bfi.uchicago.edu/working-paper/2022-26/\">about 30%</a>\u2014not only higher than could be explained by a reduction in diarrhea alone, but also higher than we'd expect when taking into account indirect effects (i.e., deaths that occur because waterborne diseases may make people more vulnerable to other causes of death).<a href=\"#fn-Kaw2cxigk82jgmGFh-2\"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p><p>To come to our estimate of the effect size, we completed our own meta-analysis, and we commissioned two external experts (see <a href=\"https://files.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/Interventions/Water/Clasen_Report_on_independent_review_2021.pdf\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://files.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/Interventions/Water/Higgs_Summary_of_Evaluation_of_Kremer_et_al_2021_2021.pdf\">here</a>) to review the original meta-analysis so that we could consider their views. We pooled data from the five RCTs in the Kremer meta-analysis that focus on chlorination (as opposed to other water quality interventions) and have follow-up lengths of at least one year (to exclude studies in which we think publication bias is more likely).<a href=\"#fn-Kaw2cxigk82jgmGFh-3\"><sup>[3]</sup></a> We excluded one RCT that meets our other criteria because we think the results are implausibly high such that we don't believe they represent the true effect of chlorination interventions (more in footnote).<a href=\"#fn-Kaw2cxigk82jgmGFh-4\"><sup>[4]</sup></a> It's unorthodox to exclude studies for this reason when conducting a meta-analysis, but we chose to do so because we think it gives us an overall estimate that is more likely to represent the true effect size.</p><p>Our estimate suggests that chlorination reduces all-cause mortality among children under five by roughly 12%, as compared to 30% in the Kremer meta-analysis on water quality interventions.<a href=\"#fn-Kaw2cxigk82jgmGFh-5\"><sup>[5]</sup></a> (We then adjust this 12% figure for the particular context in which a program takes place, as described in our <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2023/11/09/how-we-work-2-specific-opportunities/\">previous blog post</a>.)</p><p>Our approach to calculating this effect has sparked thoughtful comments from others, such as <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2023/04/08/givewells-change-our-mind-contest-cost-effectiveness-and-water-quality-interventions/\">Witold Wi\u0119cek</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6cJM2pWH8dz9TnBRy/an-examination-of-givewell-s-water-quality-intervention-cost\">Matthew Romer and Paul Romer Present</a>. We think reasonable researchers might make different choices about how to interpret the literature and how to come to an overall estimate, and we're still considering other approaches. At the same time, we're currently comfortable with the approach we've chosen as a way of reaching a sensible bottom line.</p><p><i><strong>Valuing disparate outcomes: Comparing clubfoot treatment to life-saving programs</strong></i></p><p>In early 2023, we made a <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/miraclefeet-clubfoot-treatment-january-2023\">grant</a> to support MiracleFeet's treatment of clubfoot, a painful congenital condition that limits mobility. To compare the cost-effectiveness of this program to other programs we fund, we need an estimate of how valuable it is to successfully treat a child's case of clubfoot compared to how valuable it is to avert the death of a child.</p><p>This question\u2014how bad is a case of clubfoot?\u2014doesn't have a \"correct\" numerical answer. The Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation's Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study is our usual source for estimates of how bad different diseases and disabilities are, but it doesn't have an estimate specifically for clubfoot. We spoke with a disability expert and reviewed related literature to get a better sense of clubfoot\u2019s impact on an affected person. We wanted to understand how painful clubfoot is, how much it impacts a person's ability to do things, and how stigma related to clubfoot affects well-being and opportunities.</p><p>Ultimately, we chose to use the GBD weight for \"disfigurement level 2 with pain and moderate motor impairment due to congenital limb deficiency\" as a proxy for bilateral clubfoot (i.e., clubfoot affecting both legs). Our understanding is that this GBD weight accounts for a physical disability that is sore and itchy, where the person has some difficulty moving around, and where other people might stare and comment. We selected it based on our understanding of the experience of untreated clubfoot, informed by the literature we read and our conversations with a disability expert and MiracleFeet. We use 75% of that value as a proxy for unilateral clubfoot (i.e., clubfoot affecting just one leg).<a href=\"#fn-Kaw2cxigk82jgmGFh-6\"><sup>[6]</sup></a> With these values, each case of clubfoot averted over the course of someone's lifetime is one-quarter as valuable as averting the death of a young child.<a href=\"#fn-Kaw2cxigk82jgmGFh-7\"><sup>[7]</sup></a> But, we're still very uncertain about the true value\u2014our best estimate is that there's a 50% chance that the \"true\" value is between one-eighth as good and one-third as good as averting a death.<a href=\"#fn-Kaw2cxigk82jgmGFh-8\"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p><p>These estimates imply that MiracleFeet, which we believe averts a case of clubfoot for roughly $1,200,<a href=\"#fn-Kaw2cxigk82jgmGFh-9\"><sup>[9]</sup></a> is about as cost-effective as our top charities. That's why we've funded it and are interested in <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/miraclefeet-monitoring-and-evaluation-may-2023\">learning more</a>.</p><p><i><strong>Anticipating the likely decisions of other actors: Predicting the impact of technical assistance for syphilis screening and treatment</strong></i></p><p>We recommended a <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/evidence-action-syphilis-july-2022\">grant</a> to Evidence Action for syphilis screening and treatment during pregnancy, which reduces adverse outcomes including neonatal mortality and stillbirths. Rather than directly delivering tests and antibiotics, Evidence Action is working to support the governments in Cameroon and Zambia in providing the program. The goal is to support the Ministries of Health in switching from using HIV rapid tests to using HIV/syphilis dual rapid tests for pregnant people and providing penicillin to people who test positive for syphilis.</p><p>For policy-oriented work, we have to make predictions and think about counterfactuals: What will happen with Evidence Action's support, and what would have happened without it? In assessing the expected cost-effectiveness of this grant, two key questions are:</p><ul><li>Would Zambia or Cameroon scale up dual HIV/syphilis testing and treatment even in the absence of Evidence Action's support?</li><li>Will the program be successfully transitioned to the government such that it ultimately continues without ongoing support from Evidence Action?</li></ul><p>Focusing just on Zambia, we estimated a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mR8KHlwSg1F8Zh-FC96Hec1a7jlF2QVmPBHoP7v6owo/edit#gid=1992133975&amp;range=C34\">50%</a> chance that the dual test would have been adopted by the government in the absence of Evidence Action's support, and we also estimated that had it been adopted by the government, it would have happened about a year later than with Evidence Action's support. With Evidence Action's support, we estimate an <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mR8KHlwSg1F8Zh-FC96Hec1a7jlF2QVmPBHoP7v6owo/edit#gid=1992133975&amp;range=C33\">80%</a> chance of successful adoption, and a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mR8KHlwSg1F8Zh-FC96Hec1a7jlF2QVmPBHoP7v6owo/edit#gid=1992133975&amp;range=C35\">70%</a> chance that the program successfully transitions to the government. Much of the projected impact comes from increases in treatment; for Zambia, we're projecting <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mR8KHlwSg1F8Zh-FC96Hec1a7jlF2QVmPBHoP7v6owo/edit#gid=1992133975&amp;range=C24\">70%</a> of people who test positive will receive treatment with Evidence Action's support, as compared to <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1mR8KHlwSg1F8Zh-FC96Hec1a7jlF2QVmPBHoP7v6owo/edit#gid=1992133975&amp;range=C25\">45%</a> (which we think is very roughly the current treatment rate) without it.</p><p>These figures are subjective, and come from our perspective on factors like the apparent level of <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/evidence-action-syphilis-july-2022#We_are_uncertain_about_the_level_of_government_commitment\">government interest</a> in implementing dual testing, the simplicity of the intervention, and the fact that it leverages existing HIV testing infrastructure.</p><p>We made predictions about the outcome of this grant <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/evidence-action-syphilis-july-2022#Forecasts\">here</a> and will be able to look back and compare our predictions to what actually happens, though of course we won't be able to find out what would have happened if we hadn't funded the program.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>We aim to create estimates that represent our true beliefs. Our cost-effectiveness analyses are firmly rooted in evidence but also incorporate adjustments and intuitions that aren't fully captured by scientific findings alone. (When there are gaps in the evidence base, we also fund additional research where feasible\u2014more on that in a later post.)</p><p>Ultimately, we make decisions based on our best estimates even though some of the values are subjective and even though we aren't sure we're right. Our work requires taking action despite incomplete information. We make recommendations that reflect our true beliefs about where we believe funding can do the most good, and we share our decision-making process <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/about/values\">transparently</a> so that people can evaluate our conclusions.</p><h2>Notes</h2><hr><p>As an aside, GiveWell is often associated with randomized controlled trials (RCTs), which underpin many of our recommendations, but we also consider other experimental or observational evidence, especially when RCTs aren't feasible. RCTs provide particularly strong causal evidence because of how they're designed: the idea is to randomly allocate people or sets of people (e.g., villages or schools) to either a \"treatment\" group (which receives the intervention in question) or a \"control\" group (which doesn't). Randomization should mean the two groups are similar as long as the study population is large enough, so any substantial differences in outcomes can be attributed to the intervention.</p><p>Examples of recent research questions for which we've reviewed observational evidence and for which experimental evidence is hard to come by (for ethical or other reasons) include:</p><ul><li>The <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/oral-rehydration-solution-zinc#Evidence_from_community_settings\">effect</a> of community delivery of oral rehydration solution on mortality from diarrhea</li><li>The <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/syphilis-screening-and-treatment-during-pregnancy#Effectiveness_of_tests_and_treatments\">effect</a> of benzathine penicillin G (an antibiotic) in preventing negative health outcomes from congenital syphilis</li><li>The <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/grants/RESET-alcohol-December-2021#How_much_does_alcohol_consumption_harm_health\">health effects</a> of alcohol consumption</li></ul><p>Studies on the mortality impact of <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/water-quality-interventions#Studies_of_historical_water_quality_improvements\">historical water quality improvements</a> suggest that water quality interventions may reduce mortality from non-waterborne diseases. This is called the Mills-Reincke phenomenon and provides a plausible explanation for the unexpectedly large estimate of the impact of chlorination on mortality in children under five. <a href=\"#fnref-Kaw2cxigk82jgmGFh-2\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/water-quality-interventions#Randomized_controlled_trials\">this section</a> of our intervention report for more detail. <a href=\"#fnref-Kaw2cxigk82jgmGFh-3\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p><p>Briefly, Haushofer et al. 2021 finds a 63% reduction in all-cause mortality in children under five (95% confidence interval of 13% to 105%). It estimates that chlorination was 18 percentage points higher in the treatment than the control group. At face value, that result implies that drinking clean water averts most of the deaths that would otherwise occur among young children and/or there were very large spillover effects from water chlorination programs (even at the low end of the 95% confidence interval). Our view is that this is unlikely to be the case.

These are not the only types of bonds (for example, metallic bonds are strong but will not be discussed here). Note that the following definitions are all chem 101 simplifications. The bond strengths vary depending on which atoms are bonded and a bunch of other factors, but I just want to give a general picture here.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covalent_bond\">Covalent bonds</a>: Covalent bonds arise when atoms \u201cshare\u201d electron pairs between them, allowing them to get closer to a complete \u201cshell\u201d. These bonds are very strong, typically being <a href=\"https://chem.libretexts.org/Bookshelves/General_Chemistry/Map%3A_Chemistry_-_The_Central_Science_(Brown_et_al.)/08%3A_Basic_Concepts_of_Chemical_Bonding/8.08%3A_Strength_of_Covalent_Bonds\">hundreds of kJ/mol</a>, depending on the atoms involved.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_bonding\">Ionic bonds</a>: Some atoms really want to get rid of electrons, and some atoms really want to receive extra electrons. If one of each meets, an electron will jump from one to the other, making each atom oppositely charged, so they stick together. Ionic bond strength can vary quite a bit, with variations between <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionic_bonding\">170 and 1500 kj/mol</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bond\">Hydrogen bonds</a>: These bonds occur because hydrogen only has one electron. If that one electron covalently bonds with another atom, then it\u2019s stuck on one side of the hydrogen, so the other side is positively charged. At the same time, another nearby atom, like oxygen, might have unbonded electrons hanging out preferentially on one side. This brings the hydrogen and other atom together electrostatically, where they bond. Compared to the previous two, this is a comparatively weak bond, typically around <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen_bond\">10 kJ/mol</a>.</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waals_force\">Van der waals forces</a>:</p><p>This is the name for a collection of very weak forces acting between atoms. Primarily these are a result of fluctuating polarisations on neighbouring atoms, and tend to be transient and weak. The strength varies depending on definitions, with one source telling me <a href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/definition-of-van-der-waals-forces-604681\">0.4 to 4 kJ/mol</a>, and wikipedia mentioning strengths as low as 0.04 <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_der_Waals_force\">kj/mol</a>. They are generally defined by their weakness.</p><p>A definitional note: Some sources will include hydrogen bonds as a <i>subset</i> of Van der Waals forces, as they both count as intermolecular forces. It is more common to separate the two definitionally, such as by saying that hydrogen bonds are permanent dipoles, while Van der Waals forces are not. The main reason to do so is that hydrogen bonds are generally much stronger and more permanent than Van der Waals forces.</p><p><i><strong>Edit:&nbsp;</strong></i><strong> </strong><i>Talking merely about the types of bonds can be misleading when talking about material strength, as the amount of bonds also matters. &nbsp;A chemist told me that \"long series of hydrogen bonds or even vdW forces (in things like UHMWPE fibers) can be stronger than single covalently bound strands\". &nbsp;This is another problem with the quotes above.&nbsp;</i></p><p><strong>Bonds in proteins</strong></p><p>Now that we\u2019ve got these definitions in place, let\u2019s get to the question at hand. What forces are present in biology? The image below shows the primary structure of a protein chain.</p><p>What percentage of the bonds shown below correspond to each of the four bond types I listed above? I encourage you to <i><strong>take a guess now</strong></i>, before scrolling down.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aCEAczDuRrZihaLNA/oywsemnldzkwbyyexqoa\" alt=\"undefined\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aCEAczDuRrZihaLNA/qk8s1n1bfarv2rmwhuvh 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aCEAczDuRrZihaLNA/gq5wyrhlaolxt4zituqg 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aCEAczDuRrZihaLNA/g4mjycmns0lrai7qymrj 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aCEAczDuRrZihaLNA/oywsemnldzkwbyyexqoa 1456w\"><figcaption>Amino acid bonds, from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein\">here</a></figcaption></figure><p>The answer is as follows:</p><p><i><strong>100% of the bonds are covalent.</strong></i></p><p>Okay, I\u2019ll admit, I have played a small trick here, and to explain why, I\u2019ll have to explain a bit more about how proteins work.</p><p>To build a protein, a ribosome will read DNA to choose from a set of 22 available <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amino_acid\">amino acids</a>, and then stitch them together like beads on a string. Each amino acid is held together almost entirely by covalent bonds, and the peptide bonds between amino acids are also covalent in nature. This initial string is called the \u201cprimary structure\u201d. The R1, R2 and R3 in the above picture represent \u201cside chains\u201d, extra bits that are unique to each amino acid and can have a significant effect on it\u2019s behavior. These side chains are also primarily (or possibly entirely?) covalent in nature.</p><p>However, a long string is not a stable structure. As soon as this bead is spit out, it starts wiggling around and folding up until it\u2019s reached a relatively stable 3d structure. The \u201cprotein folding problem\u201d of predicting how this fold would occur was a super-hard problem, which was recently cracked using deep learning techniques by Deepminds Alphafold 2 program, which can now predict 3d structures from base structures with very high accuracy. Folding structure is often divided up into three or four regimes of structure as shown in the following image:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aCEAczDuRrZihaLNA/c4yleuq62xix19oatfaj\" alt=\"Flowchart depicting the four orders of protein structure.\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aCEAczDuRrZihaLNA/xyldedt80dlvjvj8i4jf 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aCEAczDuRrZihaLNA/w1u3x5hnilkttu7se5pw 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aCEAczDuRrZihaLNA/u7yiqniz9xawn00rp3xa 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aCEAczDuRrZihaLNA/c4yleuq62xix19oatfaj 1456w\"><figcaption>Folding sequence from <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/proteins-and-amino-acids/a/orders-of-protein-structure\">here</a></figcaption></figure><p>Okay. So we\u2019ve established that primary structure is overwhelmingly covalent, let\u2019s move on to the \u201csecondary structure\u201d. This is where the chain folds up into itself so that the \u201cbackbone\u201d (the none side-chain part) of one section bonds with the backbone of the other. This usually takes the shape of either parallel sheets or helices, as shown in the image below.</p><p>Feel free to estimate once again, for the next image, how the bond types are divided up:</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:72.33%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aCEAczDuRrZihaLNA/gz2vakagp6nnvs7mj1he\" alt=\"Images showing hydrogen bonding patterns in beta pleated sheets and alpha helices.\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aCEAczDuRrZihaLNA/i0awgg2pwx9ewd5x7tjn 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aCEAczDuRrZihaLNA/dt5xwpre1krhxbgrlei4 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aCEAczDuRrZihaLNA/kcsbdche9olivu7itdak 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aCEAczDuRrZihaLNA/gz2vakagp6nnvs7mj1he 1456w\"><figcaption>Secondary structure from <a href=\"https://www.khanacademy.org/science/biology/macromolecules/proteins-and-amino-acids/a/orders-of-protein-structure\">here</a></figcaption></figure><p>I did a rough count, and in the sheet pictured it\u2019s roughly 90% covalent bonds.

However, for most if not all proteins, the order of prevalence will be covalent bonds&gt;hydrogen bonds&gt; everything else.</p><p><s>To summarize, proteins are held together by a combination of bond types, primarily covalent bonds and secondarily hydrogen bonds, with other forces playing some part, depending on the protein.</s></p><p><i><strong>Edit</strong>: I think that the previous summary was a little muddled. I would summarize it now as follows:</i></p><p><i>The primary structure of protein is held together with covalent bonds, with the secondary backbone held together by hydrogen bonds. At the tertiary level, these chains are held together by a combination of many different bonds and forces, such as hydrophobic interactions, hydrogen bonds, Van der Waals forces, and covalent bond links, all of which contribute to it's 3D structure with differing importance depending on the material.&nbsp;</i></p><p>As a result, I am now certain that the statement \u201c<i>proteins are held together by van der Waals forces <strong>rather than</strong> covalent bonds</i>\u201d is <i><strong>false</strong></i>. It\u2019s false even if you put hydrogen bonding in the \u201cVan der Waals forces\u201d category, which would be misleading in this context. Nobody who knew about the actual structure of proteins would use the phrase \u201ccovalently bonded alternatives to biology\u201d. The <i>entire field of organic chemistry</i> arises from carbon\u2019s thirst for covalent bonds.</p><p>Weirdly, I\u2019ve popped open my copy of \u201cengines of creation\u201d, which Yudkowsky cites for his claims, and I see <i>nothing</i> about Van der Waals forces or covalent bonds. In fact, Drexler spends quite a while praising the flexibility and versatility of proteins: he views custom designed protein machines as the first step on the road to nanotech. He merely notes that biological material are not as durable as metals and diamond. Of course, Drexler is not a biologist so even if he had said it, it would still have been worth fact-checking.</p><p>\u201cCovalent bonds\u201d were not the motivation for molecular nanotech. Rather, it was about atomically precise manufacturing: that you could avoid the wiggly randomness of biology and instead place molecules atom by atom mechanically using a system of nanoscale manipulators. The hope was that you could build a universal assembler that could build <i>anything</i>, and not be limited to biological materials or biological assembly techniques. This would include extremely strong structures such as diamond or pure metals, but could also be anything else that MNT proponents can dream of. If you wanted a new car, you\u2019d just send it off to a universal assembler, which would build the entire thing from scratch in your garage.</p><p>Of course, it\u2019s easy to dream up such things, and much harder to actually build it. As I described in a <a href=\"https://titotal.substack.com/p/diamondoid-bacteria-nanobots-deadly\">previous post</a>, attempts to actually <i>build</i> such a thing have completely stalled at the first hurdle. It may just be unworkable in practicality.</p><p><strong>Gullibility filters</strong></p><p>I think a key danger of these sort of mistakes is that they act as a<i><strong> </strong>gullibility filter</i>.</p><p>Anybody with a chemistry or biology background who hears someone confidently utter the phrase \u201ccovalently bonded equivalents to biology\u201d will immediately have their bullshit alarm triggered, and will probably dismiss everything else you say as well. This also goes for anyone with enough skeptical instinct to google claims to ensure they have the bare minimum of scientific backing.</p><p>This isn\u2019t an isolated incident either, by the way. See my write-up on the <a href=\"https://titotal.substack.com/p/an-intro-to-quantum-physics-fixing\">errors in the math in the quantum physics sequences</a>, or the errors in economics <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/woCPxs8GxE7H35zzK/noting-an-error-in-inadequate-equilibria\">described here</a>.</p><p>So the people who know things, and the people who actually google things, will disproportionately come to the conclusion that EA is talking nonsense and not join, whereas the people who blindly accept any scientific sounding word they hear will just walk right in. I think this is not good for the epistemic health of a community.</p><p><strong>Strong biology?</strong></p><p>Moving on, what do I think of the broader points about biology being \u201cweak\u201d? Well it\u2019s not like biology has slept on the idea of \u201cmake strong things\u201d:</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:89.52%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aCEAczDuRrZihaLNA/pnoaqoay87d1ntkdcu2n\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aCEAczDuRrZihaLNA/b4gjwzabzxf5r4omesxn 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aCEAczDuRrZihaLNA/hvxtkonum8lv83dm8iqf 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aCEAczDuRrZihaLNA/zf0fyzso12ig85uncs1p 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aCEAczDuRrZihaLNA/pnoaqoay87d1ntkdcu2n 1456w\"><figcaption>Pictured: \u201cweak\u201d biology (pictures from wikipedia)</figcaption></figure><p>Have you heard of wood? Horns? claws, shells, bones? They all seem pretty strong to me. There are also materials with extremely high strength to weight ratios, like spider silk. Some of these are made with hard proteins such as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keratin\">keratin</a>, some are made with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineralized_tissues\">mineralized tissue</a>, or a combination the two.</p><p>This is not to say that a fully diamondoid based nanobot, (if such a thing is even possible) wouldn\u2019t be stronger than these examples. Protein is not <i>entirely</i> covalent, which introduces weaknesses. When put into extreme conditions such as high heat, they may lose their secondary and tertiary structure and unfold back to their primary covalently bonded structure, in a process called \u201cdenaturation\u201d. Diamond can avoid this fate as all of it\u2019s bonds are equally strong.</p><p>My point here is merely to say that this is not a case of diamond vs \u201cstatic cling\u201d, but diamond vs wood or bone. Don't underestimate biological ingenuity!</p><p><strong>Flexibility</strong></p><p>My other point is this: Are we sure we even <i>want</i> our proteins to be strictly covalently bonded?</p><p>In my <a href=\"https://titotal.substack.com/p/diamondoid-bacteria-nanobots-deadly\">previous post</a>, I covered the woes of trying to stick two carbon atoms to a carbon surface. The issue was this: you have to pick the atoms up and drop them in place. But the only way to pick them up, at that scale, was to covalently bond them to your transport tip, then covalently bond the atoms and the tip to the surface, and then forcibly rip the transport atom from the surface to leave .The analogy I used was that it was like trying to lay bricks when your gloves are coated in superglue. &nbsp;</p><p>In this scenario, the fact that covalent bonds are strong <i>is the problem</i>. It would actually be fantastic if you could use weak forces here: you lightly stick the atoms to your transport tip, drop it into the covalent bond spot, and then easily pull the transport tip away.&nbsp;</p><p>Biology pretty much does this. For example, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme\">enzymes</a> like the one pictured below hold molecules in place through <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK9921/#:~:text=Substrates%20initially%20bind%20to%20the,the%20product%20of%20the%20reaction.\">noncovalent bonding</a>, facilitate a chemical reaction between them, and then release them.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:51.2%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aCEAczDuRrZihaLNA/spp7brrqig9bwca65mkc\" alt=\"Hexokinase displayed as an opaque surface with a pronounced open binding cleft next to unbound substrate (top) and the same enzyme with more closed cleft that surrounds the bound substrate (bottom)\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aCEAczDuRrZihaLNA/tqcsatw3q5rxwwpxh6au 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aCEAczDuRrZihaLNA/iywj4hgahalnyxblduob 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aCEAczDuRrZihaLNA/tv4f8p1dmte4yxlzrmcd 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aCEAczDuRrZihaLNA/spp7brrqig9bwca65mkc 1456w\"><figcaption>A flexible enzyme allows for improved reactivity between incoming molecules (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enzyme\">from wikipedia</a>)</figcaption></figure><p>As part of the process, parts of the enzyme actually shift and mold their structures around the incoming molecules in order to better catalyse reactions. I\u2019m not sure how easily you could replicate this using stiff strictly covalent structures. <i><strong>Edit: read the response by an organic chemist below for further discussion on this point.&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p>Part of the reason that proteins are so flexible and versatile is exactly the fact that they <i>aren\u2019t</i> fully welded together by covalent bonds, and thus can utilise multiple strengths of force as necessary for their purposes.</p><p><strong>Back to the drawing board?</strong></p><p>Imagine there was a boss and inventor who knew nothing about biology, and set out to build molecular machines. After fifty years of hard work, he rushes in and we get the following exchange:</p><p><strong>Inventor:</strong><i> \u201cEUREKA! I\u2019ve invented a fully functioning self-replicating molecular machine. We can use this elaborate structure called DNA to encode strings of amino acids, and they will automatically fold into a virtually unlimited variety of 3 dimensional structures that can do a huge variety of microscale tasks, including replicating themselves using these incredibly complicated structures called \u201ccells\u201d. The possibilities are endless!\u201d</i></p><p><strong>Boss:</strong> <i>\u201ceh, I dunno, this design seems like weak shit. It\u2019s not as tough as diamond and it's not entirely covalent.

But that doesn\u2019t mean that something better can be built <i>quickly</i>. The DNA/RNA model has been refined with over 3 billion years of practical trial and error experimentation on a planetary scale. Evolution may be dumb and slow, but it\u2019s also got a ridiculous head start.</p><p>I do not expect evolution to have created the best molecular machinery it is possible to ever make, given infinite time and resources. Evolution provides constraints on how changes can occur, so if you remove these constraints, you can, almost by definition, do better. But it seems to me like the smart thing to do, if you want to build effective self replicating nanomachines quickly, is to piggyback off the natural experimentation of biology, and make even cooler and better things within the DNA framework, rather than starting from scratch and trying to reinvent the wheel. I think this is true for humans, and I think it\u2019s also true for non-godlike AI\u2019s.</p><p>I am very excited to see what can be accomplished in biology in the years to come. We are now in the age of Alphafold 2 and CRISPR, and I expect at least some incredibly cool stuff to come out of that. In my <a href=\"https://titotal.substack.com/p/diamondoid-bacteria-nanobots-deadly\">previous post</a>, I highlighted DNA robots and DNA origami as impressive advances that I will keep an eye on, as we learn it\u2019s advantages and limitations .</p><p>I think there is still a lot of room to explore what biology tells us about the potential capabilities and dangers of molecular machines, biological or otherwise. I would be very interested to hear from any biologists who have expertise in these areas.</p><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><p>I believe that the claims about protein bonding repeatedly made by Yudkowsky are factually incorrect. <s>Proteins are primarily held together by covalent bonds, and secondarily by hydrogen bonds, with Van der Waals forces sometimes but not always contributing</s>. <i>Edit</i>: <i>Proteins are held together by a variety of forces, with a primary structure of covalent bonds, and also contain covalent bonds at the tertiary level, including sometimes as the dominant structural force</i>. &nbsp;It is true that molecular machines based on diamondoid or metal could be physically stronger that biology, but attempts to build such machines have completely stalled. Biology can still build very strong materials such as wood and bone, and the use of non-covalent bonds can actually be very useful for the flexibility and versatility of proteins such as enzymes.</p><p><strong>Edit: a breakdown of the claims I have a problem with</strong></p><p>&nbsp;I originally left this as a comment, but decided to include it as an edit in the post as well. I thought that the problems with the original quotes were self-evident, but it may be worth breaking down each quote in turn. The following are ranked from roughly most to least wrong.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>human technology figuring out <i><strong>how to use covalent bonds and metallic bonds, where biology sticks to ionic bonds and proteins held together by van der Waals forces</strong></i></p></blockquote><p>This is just straight up, explicitly false. Biology does not \"stick to ionic bonds and proteins\". As I pointed out, biology is made up of covalent bonds at it's very core, and uses them all the time.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i><strong>covalently bonded equivalents of biology where instead of proteins that fold together and are held together by static cling, you have things that go down much sharper potential energy gradients and are bundled together</strong></i></p></blockquote><p>The phrase \"covalently bonded equivalents to biology\" implicitly states that biology is not covalently bonded. This is false.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i><strong>I have mostly shifted to trying to talk about \u201ccovalently bonded\u201d bacteria</strong></i></p></blockquote><p>The context of this claim is that Yudkowsky is trying to come up with a new name for deadly Drexler-style nanomachines. He has chosen \"covalently bonded bacteria\", implying that \"covalently bonded bacteria\" and normal bacteria are different things. Except that's not true, because bacteria is completely full of covalent bonds.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><strong>Algae are tiny microns-wide solar-powered fully self-replicating factories that run on general assemblers, \"ribosomes\", that can replicate most other products of biology given digital instructions.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Okay, I just saw this one, but ribosomes are not \"general\" assemblers, and they cannot replicate \"most other products of biology\". They do literally one thing, and that is read instructions and link together amino acids to form proteins.&nbsp;</p><p>For the next two, let's establish the principle that if you say \"X is held together by Y <i><strong>instead of</strong></i><strong> </strong>Z\", you are implicitly making the statement that \"X is not held together by Z\", or perhaps that \"Z is irrevelant compared to Y when talking about how X is held together\", <i>or that \"Y is the dominant structural force compared to Z\"</i>. Otherwise you would not have used the word <i><strong>instead of</strong></i>. Would you utter the phrase \"animal bodies are held together by flesh <i>instead of</i> skeletons?\"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i><strong>proteins bound together by weak van der Waals forces instead of strong covalent bonds</strong></i></p></blockquote><p>This implicitly makes the statement \"proteins are not held together by strong covalent bonds\", which is false. Or it could be saying \"strong covalent bonds are irrelevant compared to van der waals forces when talking about how proteins are held together\", which is also false. &nbsp;<i>edit: Or it is saying that \"van der waals forces are the dominant structural force in proteins\", which is also false, because this is materially dependent, and some proteins have covalent disulfide links as their dominant structural </i><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5808910/\"><i>force</i></a><i>.</i> &nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>even though the proteins are held together by van der Waals forces rather than covalent bonds, which is why algae are far less tough than diamond</strong></i></p><p>\"rather than\" means the same thing as \"instead of\", and therefore makes an implicitly false statement for the reason I said in the last quote. &nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i><strong>proteins are held together by van der Waals forces that are much weaker than covalent bonds</strong></i></p></blockquote><p>Actually, this one is defensible, because it didn't use the phrase \"instead of\". I would still prefer more qualifying terms such \"the weakest link\". If this had been the only statement, I would not have written this post.&nbsp;</p><p>It is fairly easy to fix most of these statements. As an example, you could say something like \"the 3d structure of protein contains weak links like hydrophic bonds that are easy to break apart, whereas Drexler style tech could be made from 100% densely packed strictly covalent bonds\"</p><p>I appreciate the difficulty of science communication and the need for simplification, but I believe that if it is easy to avoid saying false things, you should do so.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Final edit:</strong></p><p>An organic chemist going by \"skillissuer\" reached out, saying they broadly agree with the post, but had nitpicks. I thought it was interesting enough to just include what they wrote directly here:</p><p><i>I think that chemistry 101 classification of bonds is a tad useless here. Instead, you can go from first principles: there are things that happen when atomic orbitals overlap (covalent bonds, metallic and such), there are interactions that are mostly electrostatic in nature (ionic, dipole-dipole, quadrupole-quadrupole - important biologically as pi-stacking, also ion-quadrupole etc) and there are things that are a result of exchange interaction (van der Waals and steric repulsion). Hydrogen bonds would be a mix of dipole-dipole and van der Waals interaction. You don\u2019t have to transfer electrons in order to have ionic interaction, most of the time in biologically relevant situations it\u2019s proton transfer, or charges just were there previously. Hydrophobic interactions are almost entirely a solvent effect and aren\u2019t a bond strictly speaking</i></p><p><i>In water, i\u2019m pretty sure that proteins are mostly held by hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. EY is correct in that some proteins hold shape by mostly noncovalent interactions, but these are mostly hydrogen, ionic, hydrophobic interactions and the proteins that actually provide mechanical strength run in continuous covalent strands through entire length of them anyway (collagen, keratin). I don\u2019t think that counting bonds and saying that something is 90% bound covalently is a meaningful metric, because long series of hydrogen bonds or even vdW forces (in things like UHMWPE fibers) can be stronger than single covalently bound strand, ie if you tried to pull out a single strand of kevlar or collagen from bulk material, above certain length you won\u2019t pull it apart, you\u2019d just break it because collective energy of hydrogen bonds will be greater than single covalent bond holding it together, that\u2019s why these fibers are strong in the first place</i></p><p><i>There is another kind of flexibility that you haven\u2019t mentioned: proteins are made out of single covalently bound strand, yes, but these aren\u2019t straight C-C chains. Making and especially breaking C-C bonds in controlled way is hard, proteins can be just hydrolyzed at amide bonds. If protein breaks in some way, and in real world everything breaks, it can be recycled into aminoacids (+ any cofactors etc) and then put back in a pretty straightforward way; you can\u2019t do this with diamondoids, when it breaks, it breaks hard, and you\u2019re done unless you\u2019re picking everything apart atom by atom which would be much harder and more energy intensive. As it happens you can buy bulk adamantane, but it\u2019s just made in conditions where C-C bonds are weak (high temperature) and it\u2019s preferentially formed because it\u2019s most stable thermodynamically among its isomers (that are starting materials). Conversely, if you use weaker bonds, you can make pieces conform to some template, or to each other without breaking everything at once - this is basis of dynamic combinatorial chemistry. There\u2019s also entire field of self-healing materials that is based almost entirely on these either noncovalent or reversible covalent bonds</i></p><blockquote><p><i>As part of the process, parts of the enzyme actually shift and mold their structures around the incoming molecules in order to better catalyse reactions. I\u2019m not sure how easily you could replicate this using stiff strictly covalent structures.</i></p></blockquote><p><i>You actually don\u2019t have to do that, and there are some small organocatalysts that are entirely covalently bonded and do the same job. However you can\u2019t make them from from aminoacids, these don\u2019t have secondary structure (too small) and are generally less active. The bare minimum is to provide a receptor for transition state, and you can make it work without drastic changes in conformation. You could make your catalyst as stiff as you like, and it\u2019ll even make activity higher - but only if none of these stiff parts interfere with binding of substrates, and your options are limited. It\u2019s often better to leave some wiggle room. Short peptides aren\u2019t really stiff enough in ways that matter there and instead it\u2019s secondary and tertiary structure that puts important bits in the right place</i></p>", "user": {"username": "titotal"}}, {"_id": "u93z7vPbDmPQGnBSd", "title": "(Report) Evaluating Taiwan's Tactics to Safeguard its Semiconductor Assets Against a Chinese Invasion", "postedAt": "2023-12-07T00:01:39.324Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/u93z7vPbDmPQGnBSd/dmrj18du6049odnssozu\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/u93z7vPbDmPQGnBSd/dndp1sgteaikhgqgjr8z 180w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/u93z7vPbDmPQGnBSd/lwifcuuzccuxdru330cn 360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/u93z7vPbDmPQGnBSd/rlw1nrrrdzvpuq3x4py8 540w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/u93z7vPbDmPQGnBSd/bkoz2l6rmwyz7pxa5fdg 720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/u93z7vPbDmPQGnBSd/xobhpeppqfdydbzmsmvr 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/u93z7vPbDmPQGnBSd/u7pxjody45qg37rmropf 1080w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/u93z7vPbDmPQGnBSd/h0suvv3cknftjsssawg6 1260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/u93z7vPbDmPQGnBSd/jlbktcwkwxzem3wsze2n 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/u93z7vPbDmPQGnBSd/ihbddjfmm6agncld0a6a 1620w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/u93z7vPbDmPQGnBSd/cazhvyeiillpxoqj7u9o 1792w\"></figure><p>This was written by Gaurav Yadav and Robert Reason for the <a href=\"https://bristolaisafety.org\">Bristol AI Safety Centre</a>.</p><p><i>Thank you to David Staley, Gabriel Kulp, Lucy Farnik, Oliver Guest, and Oliver Marks for their feedback and help on this report.

Introduction</h1><h2>Overview of the \u2018Century of Humiliation\u2019</h2><p>In response to an op-ed article discussing the coronavirus, three Wall Street Journal reporters were expelled from China by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (<a href=\"http://journals.ed.ac.uk/leviathan/article/download/4242/6075\"><u>Wang, 2020</u></a>). The Chinese Communist Party (CCP) noted explicitly that the expulsion was a direct response to the title of the article, \u2018<i>China is the Real Sick Man of Asia</i>\u2019&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/a55546a0-5299-11ea-8841-482eed0038b1\"><u>Manson &amp; Shepherd, 2020</u></a>). While in isolation, this phrase appears innocuous, it is commonly associated in China with the \u2018Century of Humiliation\u2019 (CoH; <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/article/3052434/china-enraged-sick-man-asia-headline-its-origin-may-surprise-many\"><u>Yau, 2020</u></a>). Beginning with the first Opium War in 1839 and ending with the revolution in 1949, the CoH saw China lose one-third of its territory, suffer external subjugation, be forced into signing unequal treaties and fall into a civil war (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1976-5118.2010.01039.x?casa_token%3DguDpSQgIFB0AAAAA:Xx1PvvdZLBENvAkptJU9FkZXSwOsgLONqvMX2h7Oclxen-OcdEu_3ro_Osgixr9whCOv1XtW8qIr2aA\"><u>Kaufman, 2010</u></a>).</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the CoH, China held its position as the regional hegemon in East Asia, signifying its dominant power and influence for nearly two millennia (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/app5.273\"><u>Danner &amp; Martin, 2019</u></a>; <a href=\"https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/oldest-countries\"><u>World Population Review, 2023</u></a>). However, in Chinese history textbooks, this period is, in broad terms, thought of as pre-CoH, with post-CoH events being taught separately (<a href=\"https://info.publicintelligence.net/MCIA-ChinaPLA.pdf\"><u>Jianjun &amp; Shaohua, 2004</u></a>). As for why an emphasis on the CoH is so pronounced, it is often claimed in the West that such a narrative serves to legitimise the CCP (e.g., <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/aspp.12066?casa_token%3DjK_RoderHpsAAAAA:VPA7n2XvDuiJ6jLdHlFk1d_YK0DxIDGNWi6t8myPHYeMdvX8F8CpXDHRezr1rHp_TIVqrqOmK9D5HK4\"><u>Liao, 2013</u></a>; <a href=\"https://so07.tci-thaijo.org/index.php/GRPSPAJ/article/download/1109/1353\"><u>Charoenmuang, 2022</u></a>; see also <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/isq/article-pdf/52/4/783/5086271/52-4-783.pdf?casa_token%3DccE6I6GGdcEAAAAA:ESIr6OqBd0YbfyZsAaMc-Lo9TnmcAS-Lm3FZQPFAto4rdAMvP4Dk6YIBzsUvaVsXB8VQ0otMr7ti8C4\"><u>Wang, 2008</u></a>). In its strongest articulation, the narrative of humiliation credits the CCP with pulling China out of its nadir, re-establishing itself as a major global power in the process. This narrative will remain convincing if the CCP can maintain \u2018performance legitimacy\u2019 (i.e., meet concrete goals, maintain growth, and preserve social stability).</p><h2>What is the geopolitical and technological significance of Taiwan?</h2><p>Although it is maintained that the CoH concluded with the ascension of the CCP, traces of that period still linger in the national consciousness. One crucial unresolved matter from that period is Taiwan (<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20220322101844/https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/3.10.11Kaufman.pdf\"><u>Kaufman, 2011</u></a>). At the end of 2004, China enshrined into law a commitment to use \u2018non-peaceful means\u2019 as a last resort to prevent Taiwan from establishing formal independence should a peaceful reunification be wholly ruled out (<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/2005/03/08/china-sends-warning-to-taiwan-with-anti-secession-law/5dcdfae8-4523-4350-9d45-77a85f6b240f/\"><u>Cody, 2005</u></a>; <a href=\"https://www.mac.gov.tw/en/News_Content.aspx?n%3D8A319E37A32E01EA%26sms%3D2413CFE1BCE87E0E%26s%3DD1B0D66D5788F2DE%23:~:text%3DThe%2520%25E2%2580%259CAnti%252Dsecession%2520Law%25E2%2580%259D%2520of%25202005%2520has%2520further%2520expanded,China%2520should%2520occur%252C%2520or%2520that\"><u>General Policy Archives, 2005</u></a>). Its geopolitical significance today is underscored not just by its historical ties but also by its role in the modern technological landscape. Taiwan's production of approximately 60% of all semiconductors (<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/special-report/2023/03/06/taiwans-dominance-of-the-chip-industry-makes-it-more-important\"><u>The Economist, 2023</u></a>) is especially crucial when considering the rapid advancements in the chip-heavy artificial intelligence (AI) industry (<a href=\"https://www.gisreportsonline.com/r/china-taiwan-silicon-shield/\"><u>Neill, 2023</u></a>; <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence/\"><u>Hilton, 2022</u></a>).</p><p>This advancement in AI carries both tremendous promise and peril for humanity (<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/ai-impact\"><u>Roser, 2022</u></a>). If misaligned with human values, highly capable and transformative AI systems could inflict catastrophic harm, with some estimating a ten-percent chance of human extinction within the next century (<a href=\"https://ebookcentral-proquest-com.bris.idm.oclc.org/lib/bristol/detail.action?docID%3D6126508\"><u>Ord, 2020</u></a>). Recent breakthroughs in AI development have been catalysed by increased computing power available during training. State-of-the-art (SOTA) AI algorithms now routinely require millions of dollars worth of specialised computer chips tailored to execute deep learning techniques efficiently. For example, training a SOTA natural language model can involve \u2018AI chips\u2019 running nonstop for weeks or months at an estimated cost of over $100 million (<a href=\"https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/ai-chips-what-they-are-and-why-they-matter/\"><u>Khan &amp; Mann, 2020</u></a>).</p><p>Trying to train advanced/frontier AI models on general-purpose hardware would be prohibitively expensive, costing orders of magnitude more. Access to cutting-edge AI chips has thus become a critical bottleneck limiting the pace of progress on transformative AI applications.</p><h2>What is TSMC? What does it do? Why does it matter?</h2><p>The Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is a semiconductor foundry that manufactures chips designed by other companies. It is the world's largest dedicated chip foundry (i.e., a company specialising exclusively in manufacturing semiconductors; <a href=\"https://time.com/6102879/semiconductor-chip-shortage-tsmc/\"><u>Campbell, 2021</u></a>). Chip manufacturing involves the following stages: design, fabrication, assembly, testing and packaging (ATP). TSMC specialises in fabrication, which happens in \"fabs\" or factories. Fabs contain clean rooms where hundreds of precision manufacturing steps take place to build chips on silicon wafers. This involves expensive lithography machines, robotic arms, and complex chemical processes (<a href=\"https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/The-Semiconductor-Supply-Chain-Issue-Brief.pdf\"><u>Khan et al., 2021</u></a>). TSMC pioneered the \"fabless\" model, where chip designers outsource fabrication to a dedicated foundry like TSMC (<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/309493637_The_genesis_of_fabless_business_model_Institutional_entrepreneurs_in_an_adaptive_ecosystem\"><u>Sarma &amp; Sun, 2017</u></a>). In the event of a Taiwanese invasion by China, China has the potential to wield influence over TSMC\u2019s vast chip-making prowess, recalibrating its output to serve China's strategic objectives and AI capabilities.</p><h2>What are the potential impacts on semiconductor production should China invade?</h2><p>This report examines potential Taiwanese responses to a Chinese invasion aimed at protecting the semiconductor supply. Four strategies are outlined, and their feasibility is discussed: scorch, sabotage, evacuation of essential personnel (\"boatlift\"), and indirect protection of the semiconductor stockpile by alternative means of defending Taiwan's sovereignty (<i>see </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/u93z7vPbDmPQGnBSd/evaluating-taiwan-s-tactics-to-safeguard-its-semiconductor-1#IV__Taiwan_s_Perspective\"><i><u>Taiwan\u2019s Perspective</u></i></a>). The analysis focuses on the actions Taiwan could take during an invasion to deny China access to Taiwanese semiconductor fabrication facilities and expertise.</p><h1>II. Overview of TSMC</h1><p>The Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) is a chip foundry focusing solely on manufacturing semiconductor integrated circuits (IC, also called a chip), not designing them. The term \u201cfab\u201d refers to any semiconductor fabrication plant, whether run as part of an integrated device manufacturer (like Intel) or as a pure-play foundry (like TSMC; <a href=\"https://www.worldcat.org/title/880685945\"><u>Nenni &amp; McLellan, 2014</u></a>).</p><p>Building foundry plants is expensive, so instead, clients and fabless companies can benefit from fabrication without capital investment risks by outsourcing their IC designs to foundries like TSMC (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0268401201000494%23aep-section-id19\"><u>Yi-Ching Hsieh et al., 2002</u></a>).</p><h2>What is TSMC\u2019s role in global semiconductor production?</h2><p>TSMC has a monopolistic hold over the chip manufacturing market, particularly in cutting-edge nodes. It controls more than half of the world market for made-to-order chips and nearly 90% of the most advanced nodes. Its strength is evidenced by its enormous trade surplus in integrated circuits (<a href=\"https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142/S179393052300003X\"><u>Chiang, 2023</u></a>). The global reliance on semiconductors for various industries places TSMC at the heart of a critical supply chain (<a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/05206915-fd73-4a3a-92a5-6760ce965bd9\"><u>Hille, 2021</u></a>).</p><p>As a global ICT&nbsp;(Information and Communications Technology) assembly hub, China has a huge demand for cutting-edge semiconductors, particularly from Taiwan and South Korea. However, no Chinese firm can rival leading chipmakers in revenue due to technological inferiority. For example, China's largest foundry, the Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation (SMIC), lags behind Samsung and TSMC in technology by several generations (<a href=\"https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/pdf/10.1142%252FS179393052300003X\"><u>Min-Hua Chiang, 2023</u></a>). By contrast, the United States lags behind Taiwan by one or two generations, if not more, in state-of-the-art microelectronics (<a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/semiconductors-and-national-defense-what-are-stakes\"><u>Shivakumarand &amp; Wessner, 2022</u></a>). Currently, the United States relies on facilities in Taiwan for the production of the most advanced AI-enabling semiconductors that power critical defence systems.</p><p>In the event of an invasion of Taiwan, where China potentially gains control over Taiwanese fabs like TSMC, China may redirect advanced integrated circuits (ICs) production for its own strategic purposes. This scenario hinges on some assumptions. Firstly, it assumes the availability and willingness of skilled personnel, such as TSMC and ASML engineers, to continue post-conflict operations. Secondly, it presupposes the uninterrupted supply of key inputs necessary for TSMC's operations, notwithstanding potential global reactions to the conflict, including restrictions on the export of crucial raw materials to Taiwan.</p><p>Though Chinese AI labs are devoting some attention to the safety challenges of cutting-edge models (<a href=\"https://concordia-consulting.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/State-of-AI-Safety-in-China.pdf\"><u>Concordia AI, 2023</u></a>), the rapid advancement of China's AI capabilities is still a cause for concern. Further advancing its models will require abundant compute and hardware for training. Some Chinese AI models match or exceed GPT-3 in training compute. For example, Inspur's Yuan 1.0 involved a total of 3.53\u00d710<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;FLOPs for training compared to GPT-3's 3.15 x 10<sup>23</sup>&nbsp;FLOPs. However, other Chinese models seem to have been computer-constrained. Huawei's 200B-parameter model was trained for just 6.87 x 10<sup>22</sup>&nbsp;FLOPs (<a href=\"https://www.governance.ai/research-paper/recent-trends-chinas-llm-landscape\"><u>Ding &amp; Xiao, 2023</u></a>)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefny7fqkmr4o\"><sup><a href=\"#fnny7fqkmr4o\">[1]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>If China gains control of TSMC's production capacity, it could remove computational limitations on its AI models. This could allow China to rapidly advance its AI capabilities, potentially surpassing the United States.</p><h2>What does TSMC manufacture?</h2><p>TSMC is at the forefront of semiconductor technology, manufacturing some of the world's most advanced and high-performance chips. Specialising in advanced nodes, TSMC fabricates semiconductor chips with advanced process nodes labelled as '3 nm' and '5 nm'. Note that these labels are more about technological progression and marketing rather than direct measurements of the actual physical sizes of the transistors. The '3 nm' processor boasts a transistor density of approximately 314.73 million transistors per square millimetre, whereas the '5 nm' process has a transistor density of about 185.46 million transistors per square millimetre (<a href=\"https://semiwiki.com/semiconductor-manufacturers/intel/285192-can-tsmc-maintain-their-process-technology-lead/\"><u>Jones, 2020</u></a>). The manufacturing process for these sophisticated chips is highly complex, requiring state-of-the-art lithography machines designed by Advanced Semiconductor Materials Lithography (ASML Holding). TSMC owns 50% of all ASML machines globally. This gives TSMC a significant competitive advantage and positions it as a global leader in the fabrication of the world\u2019s most advanced semiconductor chips. (<a href=\"https://www.stimson.org/2022/semiconductors-and-taiwans-silicon-shield/\"><u>Cronin, 2022</u></a>).</p><p>The advanced nodes (3, 5 nm) mean that the chips have a high density of transistors, leading to greater computational power. This is crucial for handling the extensive calculations needed during the training of AI models (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.11313.pdf\"><u>Sun et al., 2020</u></a>). Smaller nodes typically allow for faster and more energy-efficient operations, which are critical for training large machine-learning models requiring immense FLOPs. Chips used for AI training, including TPUs and GPUs, inherently utilise parallel processing, a key feature that enhances their FLOP/s metric. This parallel computation is standard across these types of chips, contributing to quicker model training. Parallel processing is not a specialised optimisation but a fundamental aspect of designing these chips. Even in the case of CPUs, which are less commonly used for intensive AI training tasks, parallel processing is generally employed except in rare, power-saving scenarios.&nbsp;Such nodes are not currently produced in the US or China (<a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/semiconductors-and-national-defense-what-are-stakes\"><u>Shivakumarand &amp; Wessner, 2022</u></a>), with Intel and SMIC only being able to produce 7 nm chips (<a href=\"https://www.gisreportsonline.com/r/us-china-chip-race/\"><u>Zhang, 2023</u></a>; <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/chip-race-china-gives-huawei-steering-wheel-huaweis-new-smartphone-and-future\"><u>Allen, 2023</u></a>).</p><p>TSMC's substantial ownership of ASML machines not only demonstrates their capability to manufacture high-performance chips at scale but also underscores the critical role of skilled technicians in this process. These advanced machines require constant maintenance and oversight to the extent that they might not function effectively for even a day without someone managing their operation.</p><h2>How relevant is this to building frontier AI models?</h2><p>Control over TSMC could have significant geopolitical and technological implications. Securing its access would allow China to control a critical supply chain for semiconductors, enhancing its capabilities in training cutting-edge artificial intelligence (AI) models.</p><p>The advanced semiconductor nodes produced by TSMC are important in delivering the computational power needed for training increasingly capable AI models. These nodes, due to their efficiency and capability, significantly enhance the performance of AI systems. However, it is important to recognise that while economically more challenging, training cutting-edge AI models on older nodes, such as those produced by SMIC, is within the realm of possibility. This approach could be viable under specific conditions, including government subsidies or concerted government efforts. Although reliance on older technology incurs a higher cost, the difference may be less than typically assumed, ranging from less than 10 to 20 times the total training cost compared to using the latest nodes.</p><p>Control of TSMC could serve dual purposes for China. Economically, it would likely strengthen China's technological infrastructure, spurring advancements that could drive economic growth. Politically, superior AI models could amplify China's influence globally, intensifying competitive dynamics with the United States.</p><p>Potential effects include:</p><p>a) Intensified US-China rivalry, as both nations race to develop increasingly advanced AI systems, escalating geopolitical tensions. These tensions would have likely already been amplified by starting the invasion.</p><p>b) Higher accident risk from Western countries that try to outpace China if China seems competitive in developing transformative AI systems.</p><p>c) Existential risks from China rapidly developing powerful and potentially misaligned AI without sufficient safeguards.</p><p>d) Regulatory lag, as China may struggle to enact adequate regulations given the pace of AI advancement enabled by its semiconductor capabilities.</p><h1>III. How Would China Invade?</h1><h3>Phased Invasion</h3><p>According to Piers Wood and Charles Fergurson\u2019s analysis, the People\u2019s Liberation Army (PLA) could benefit from staging the invasion in three distinct phases: initially capturing Quemoy (Kinmen) and adjacent islands, then advancing to the Penghu Islands, and ultimately assaulting Taiwan's west coast (<a href=\"https://digital-commons.usnwc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article%3D2535%26context%3Dnwc-review\"><u>Wood &amp; Ferguson, 2001</u></a>). This 'stepping-stone' strategy enables the PLA to amass overwhelming numerical superiority at each stage, thereby diminishing the defensibility of the subsequent objective.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:387px\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/u93z7vPbDmPQGnBSd/ugnxyxqsniyi55vbu734\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><i>Figure 1:</i>&nbsp;A visualisation of island-to-island relations amongst Taiwan's islands (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0962629814000146%23abs0015\"><u>Baldacchino &amp; Tsai, 2014</u></a>).</figcaption></figure><p>The authors further argue that phased incursion serves multiple strategic purposes beyond military manoeuvring. For instance, Beijing could potentially use the initial phase to foment a domestic 'war fever,' thereby garnering popular support for military projects that would be otherwise unjustifiable in peacetime. Furthermore, intervals between the phases offer a temporal space for substantial improvements in military training based on the experiential learning accrued from the preceding phases. Intriguingly, Wood and Ferguson note that such a gradual approach could also dilute the impetus for U.S. military intervention, given that the preliminary phases may not be perceived as a full-scale assault on Taiwan.</p><h3>Port Attack</h3><p>What would attacking the West Coast look like? In addressing the PLA tactics for potential port attacks on Taiwan, Ian Easton (<a href=\"https://project2049.net/2021/07/22/hostile-harbors-taiwans-ports-and-pla-invasion-plans/\"><u>2021</u></a>) elaborates on six distinct approaches. These approaches, researched by the PLA, are Direct Amphibious Attacks, Indirect Amphibious Attacks, Sea-Skimming Raids, Air Assaults, Horizontal Attacks, and Special Forces Infiltration.</p><ol><li>The first category, <u>Direct Amphibious Attacks</u>, comes across as straightforward. It envisages PLA naval ships transporting troops into Taiwan's ports using standard shipping routes. One of the key benefits here is speed. Because the ships dock and unload quickly, more units can engage in combat in a timely manner, potentially saving lives and sapping the morale of defenders. However, the caveat is that this approach is contingent on ports being lightly defended or clear of obstacles.</li><li><u>Indirect Amphibious Attacks</u>&nbsp;are about landing forces on beaches, flanking the ports, and allowing for pincer movements. Here, the PLA may believe that attacking from flanking positions is more effective when ports are well-defended. This strategy also poses logistical challenges as these forces could be dependent on easily disrupted roadways and may become mired in urban settings.</li><li><u>Sea-Skimming Raids</u>, a third option, leverages helicopters, hovercraft, and ground-effect vehicles for a quick, nimble attack. Flying low over the water, they could bypass maritime obstacles.</li><li>Easton's analysis then discusses <u>Air Assaults</u>, where the PLA could use helicopters to drop troops into strategic positions around ports.</li><li><u>The Horizontal Attacks</u>&nbsp;category puts the focus on landing beaches, with the ports considered secondary targets. This method has the advantage of enabling the PLA to bring massive force against well-fortified ports.</li><li>Lastly, Easton considers <u>Special Forces Infiltration</u>, a high-risk, high-reward approach. Small, elite teams would be inserted into Taiwan covertly to seize critical infrastructure and prepare the battlefield. This could potentially disrupt Taiwanese command and control, but if discovered, these lightly armed units would be extremely vulnerable.</li></ol><h3>Assumptions running in this report about how an invasion plays out</h3><p>This report operates under constraints regarding the forecasting of a potential invasion scenario between China and Taiwan. Predicting the exact course and dynamics of such a complex geopolitical event is beyond the scope of this analysis. Therefore, while we have not developed a detailed model outlining the progression of an invasion, we have tried to identify and suggest optimal timings for each recommended action by Taiwan.</p><p>Each strategic action proposed for Taiwan in the event of an invasion is predicated on a general understanding of potential scenarios. These recommendations are based on a range of plausible circumstances in which Taiwan might find itself during a conflict.&nbsp;</p><p><i>The 'ideal' timings for these actions are thus suggested with the strong caveat that they are contingent on the unfolding situation and may need to be adapted in response to the specific developments of any potential invasion.</i></p><p><i>These scenarios also assume that the fabs are not destroyed in conflict - which is certainly a possibility during an invasion.</i></p><h1>IV. Taiwan\u2019s Perspective</h1><p><i>What actions could Taiwan take to protect its semiconductor technology from being seized in the event of an invasion being launched by the PRC?</i></p><h2>A.&nbsp;Scorch the fabs</h2><p>In assessing Taiwan's options to safeguard its semiconductor technology from seizure in the event of a PRC invasion, two primary strategies emerge. Firstly, Taiwan could leverage the threat of scorching<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhauugviktna\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhauugviktna\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;its own fabs as a deterrence mechanism. This strategy hinges on the premise that the potential loss of such critical infrastructure would make continuing an invasion less appealing to China. Key players in this sector, such as TSMC, MediaTek, and United Microelectronics Corporation, are integral not just to Taiwan but to the global high-tech industry (<a href=\"https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2021/03/10/geoeconomics-and-the-security-of-taiwan/\"><u>Lee, 2021</u></a>). For instance, MediaTek's significant 16% market share in global smartphone sales underlines the far-reaching impact of such a threat (<a href=\"https://www.counterpointresearch.com/insights/infographic-q2-2023-semiconductors-foundry-and-smartphoneap-share/%23:~:text%3DMediaTek%2520captured%2520the%2520third%2520position,demand%2520and%2520slow%2520China%2520market.\"><u>Counterpoint, 2023</u></a>).</p><p>Ideally, the threat of scorching the fabs should be communicated at the earliest stages of a conflict \u2014 either immediately at the onset of an invasion or even in the phase where the PRC is overtly threatening an invasion. The rationale behind this timing is twofold: firstly, it serves as an early warning to China about the severe consequences of their actions, potentially altering their calculus before significant resources are committed. Secondly, by establishing this stance early on, Taiwan signals its resolve and willingness to take extreme measures, thereby potentially deterring escalation before it reaches a point of no return.</p><p>However, should this deterrence prove ineffective, and China still continues to push on with their invasion, Taiwan can then make good on such a threat, destroying its semiconductor facilities to prevent their acquisition and use by invading forces. While this action would compromise Taiwan's security and economic strength, it could be deemed necessary to prevent the PRC from having access to the fabs and semiconductors (<a href=\"https://press.armywarcollege.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article%3D3089%26context%3Dparameters\"><u>McKinney &amp; Harris, 2021</u></a>).</p><h3>Problems with scorching</h3><p>That said, this threat is likely to be perceived as weak and, given the political salience of Taiwan to the CCP, of secondary importance (<a href=\"https://press.armywarcollege.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article%3D3138%26context%3Dparameters\"><u>Chan, 2022</u></a>). It is likely that destroying the Taiwanese fabs will do very little, if nothing, to dissuade China from continuing an invasion to take control over Taiwan. So then, the only incentive is to ensure that the CCP does not have access to the semiconductors and semiconductor production capabilities in Taiwan, and yet even these have major drawbacks.</p><p>In her national day address, the Taiwanese president advocated for a 'calm and confident' Taiwan, suggesting a preference for resilience and strategic fortitude over rash actions (<a href=\"https://english.president.gov.tw/News/6616\"><u>Office of the President Republic of China, 2023</u></a>). This stance seems at odds with the extreme measure of destroying the nation's semiconductor facilities, a cornerstone of its economy and global technological influence. Under such leadership, Taiwan might instead opt to hold its ground, playing a waiting game to observe how the conflict unfolds. In this critical juncture, Taiwan would likely aim to avoid actions that could be perceived as signs of weakness or desperation, such as the pre-emptive destruction of its own industrial assets.</p><p>Furthermore, in a world where Taiwan receives advice from the United States to destroy its semiconductor fabs as a defensive measure, Taiwan could interpret this as an implicit indication of limited direct support during the invasion. Such a scenario could unfold in two ways:</p><p><strong>Symbol of Defiance</strong>: The destruction of the semiconductor industry might be seen as a potent symbol of defiance against the invading forces. This act could signify a preference for denying resources to the invader, even at the cost of self-harm. However, this approach carries significant risks, including the potential for long-term damage to Taiwan's economic standing. The fall of Japan's semiconductor industry in the 1990s serves as a cautionary tale; despite recent efforts, Japan has struggled to regain its former prominence in this sector (<a href=\"https://www.csis.org/blogs/perspectives-innovation/japans-semiconductor-industrial-policy-1970s-today\"><u>Tomoshige, 2022</u></a>).</p><p><strong>Damaging Morale</strong>: Conversely, the deliberate scorching of Taiwan's semiconductor capabilities could severely damage morale within the country. The CCP might exploit this action in propaganda, claiming that they sought to preserve Taiwan's industry while the 'separatists' chose destruction. This narrative could weaken the Taiwanese public's resolve and undermine international sympathy.</p><p>The latter scenario, in particular, suggests that the shock value of such destruction might not justify the immense economic cost and potential political fallout. Furthermore, with diminished material incentives, the United States might find little pragmatic reason to launch a counter-offensive. While other motivations, such as self-preservation and defending democratic principles, remain, it is uncertain whether they would suffice to compel American intervention, especially in the wake of significant industrial loss in Taiwan.</p><p>Even if a counter-offensive succeeds, the loss of industry will be felt, making support for the conflict less tractable for the United States. Other motivations will remain (i.e., self-preservation, defending democracy abroad), but it is unclear whether they would be significant enough to entice the United States into defending Taiwan, which then has the secondary effect of preventing the PRC from having access to the Taiwanese fabs (<i>see </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/u93z7vPbDmPQGnBSd/evaluating-taiwan-s-tactics-to-safeguard-its-semiconductor-1#D__Indirect_protection_of_semiconductor_assets\"><i><u>Indirect Protection of Semiconductors</u></i></a>).</p><h2>B. Sabotage&nbsp;the fabs</h2><p>Rather than outright demolition, Taiwan could pursue more targeted sabotage of key fabrication equipment to impair China's access. Indeed, this appears to be Taiwan\u2019s preference, with Chen Ming-Tong (director-general of Taiwan\u2019s National Security Bureau) stating that \u2018<i>even if China got a hold of the golden hen, it won\u2019t be able to lay golden eggs\u2019</i>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-10-12/no-need-to-blow-up-tsmc-in-china-war-taiwan-security-chief-says?leadSource%3Duverify%2520wall%26embedded-checkout%3Dtrue\"><u>Zheng &amp; Wang, 2022</u></a>).</p><p>Given TSMC\u2019s reliance on ASML\u2019s lithography equipment and Washington\u2019s ban on ASML selling its most advanced machines to China, it appears unlikely that TSMC, under Chinese occupation, would be able to remain on the cutting-edge indefinitely&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.wired.co.uk/article/europe-asml-chip-shortage\"><u>Meaker, 2022</u></a>). Even if this were granted, the intricacy of the semiconductor manufacturing process leaves it vulnerable to sabotage. Consider, for example, photomasks (a reflective plate etched with intricate opaque semiconductor patterns that enable the transfer of designs onto silicon wafers). Their production relies on electron beams, lasers, and chemicals - all of which are susceptible to subtle disruption (<a href=\"https://www.routledge.com/Handbook-of-Photomask-Manufacturing-Technology/Rizvi/p/book/9780824753740\"><u>Syed Rizvi, 2005</u></a>). Altering mask substrates, tweaking precision mask writers, or tampering with developing chemicals could render masks useless, disrupting device fabrication. Sabotaging extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography machines could also prove effective. EUV lithography utilises specialised mirrors and lasers to etch extremely fine patterns, requiring meticulous engineering and conditions (<a href=\"https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/photopolymer/32/2/32_195/_pdf/-char/ja\"><u>Miyazaki &amp; Anthony, 2019</u></a>). Contaminating optics or lasers inside these scarce, expensive machines would impair fabs.</p><p>Such sabotage of photomasks or EUV lithographers could degrade fabs while avoiding the permanent destruction of facilities. The timing of such sabotage is crucial. Ideally, Taiwan might employ this tactic as a last resort, particularly when nearing defeat<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvzl154t2wt\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvzl154t2wt\">[3]</a></sup></span>, to hinder the PRC in a manner similar to a 'scorched earth' strategy. Delaying sabotage until it is absolutely necessary helps avoid prematurely damaging Taiwan\u2019s own semiconductor capabilities.</p><h3>Some uncertainties with sabotaging</h3><p>However, there is also a scenario where Taiwan might opt for earlier sabotage as a precautionary measure to prevent the PRC from intervening and stopping the sabotage process. In weighing the decision to implement early sabotage as a preemptive measure against the PRC, Taiwan must consider the potential outcomes of the conflict. If there is a belief that victory is achievable, or if there is a reasonable chance of repelling the invasion, the incentive to sabotage diminishes. This is because early sabotage, while serving as a safeguard against Chinese control of the fabs, could potentially set back Taiwan's technological standing if the conflict ends in their favour. In such a situation, an early decision to impair critical semiconductor facilities would have long-term repercussions on Taiwan's position in the global semiconductor market.</p><p>Nevertheless, irrespective of the strategic calculations at the governmental level, the actual decision to sabotage may ultimately lie with the engineers and technicians on the ground. These individuals, working within the fabs, possess the technical know-how and the physical access to carry out sabotage. In the face of an invading force, their personal decisions and actions could override official strategies. This means that even if the Taiwanese government decides against early sabotage due to a belief in a favourable outcome, individual engineers might independently choose to disable key equipment as a form of resistance.</p><h2>C. Taiwan boatlifts key staff</h2><p>With sustained Taiwanese resistance, a swift Chinese takeover may prove elusive (<a href=\"https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/publication/230109_Cancian_FirstBattle_NextWar.pdf?VersionId%3DWdEUwJYWIySMPIr3ivhFolxC_gZQuSOQ\"><u>Cancian et al., 2023</u></a>). This could create a window to evacuate key personnel working from Taiwanese fabs. Why might this be justified? In a situation where China launches an invasion, it becomes prudent for Taiwan to focus on diminishing the potential gains of the invasion for China, particularly in terms of acquiring the Taiwanese fabs.</p><p>Arguably, the tacit knowledge possessed by key employees\u2014knowledge that is difficult to express or readily acquire\u2014is vital for chip manufacturing (<a href=\"https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/CSET-Reshoring-Chipmaking-Capacity-Requires-High-Skilled-Foreign-Talent.pdf\"><u>Hunt, 2022</u></a>). Protecting key semiconductor experts might thwart China and its ability to use such fabs should it take control of Taiwanese chip manufacturing facilities.</p><p>Evacuating all employees would prove impractical due to the sheer numbers involved and possible interference from the PLA. Nonetheless, pinpointing and relocating individuals with unique expertise in production methods could be more achievable. Their absence may impede China's ability to utilise seized foundries effectively, even with intact machinery. For instance, rather than moving approximately 73,000 TSMC staff members, ensuring the safety of a crucial subset appears more viable and potentially significant.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3xu9u3yjcyt\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3xu9u3yjcyt\">[4]</a></sup></span></p><p>However, for this approach to be effective, two factors are crucial: identifying personnel whose abilities are genuinely irreplaceable and making certain those skills cannot be easily replaced by specialists from Chinese firms like SMIC. Should such individuals be capable of undertaking the same functions, the impact of such an evacuation would be lessened. The view articulated is that identifying key personnel with rare technical knowledge which cannot easily be replaced could undermine the utility of captured chip fabrication facilities for China.</p><p>Note that this relies on Taiwan repelling an invasion for a long enough time and a PRC invasion not being rapid. A swift takeover would enable China to prevent the evacuation of these essential staff. Landlocking the workers in Taiwan would be in China's interest if it wanted to exploit their skills at seised foundries. Hence, a protracted Taiwanese defence is required for this approach of evacuating irreplaceable experts to have potential.</p><p>Evacuating Taiwan's semiconductor experts necessitates identifying nearby geopolitically viable destinations. Japan, as the dominant regional power, and South Korea, host to Samsung, appear to be the most feasible proximate nations capable of receiving personnel. Their geographical closeness and advanced infrastructures make both pragmatic relocation choices. Moreover, existing Taiwanese ties with Japan and South Korea could enable smoother transitions amid a rapidly shifting scenario. Both combine proximity for accessible evacuation with sufficient resources to accommodate influxes. These factors, alongside extant diplomatic and economic bonds that could ease coordination, render Japan and South Korea as candidates for temporarily hosting Taiwan's most essential semiconductor technicians; their regional influence, physical infrastructure, and relationships with Taiwan suit them to play such a role.</p><h3>Problems&nbsp;with boatlifting</h3><p>The strategic calculus for Taiwan in the event of a conflict with China is complex, particularly regarding its semiconductor industry. While Taiwan's resilience and determination to resist a swift defeat are evident, this resolve must be balanced against the practical considerations of sustaining its economy during the conflict. The semiconductor fabs are not only critical for Taiwan's technological prowess but also form a significant part of its economic backbone. Consequently, the decision to relocate key semiconductor personnel \u2013 a move aimed at thwarting China's utilisation of these fabs \u2013 comes with its own set of challenges.</p><p>This strategy, while effective in impeding the adversary, simultaneously handicaps Taiwan's own production capacity. In the context of a war economy, where funding the conflict is crucial, the reduction in semiconductor output could have significant economic implications.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbgz1sibenc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbgz1sibenc\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The central question thus becomes: does the tactical advantage of hindering an adversary's access to advanced technology outweigh the potential long-term detriment to Taiwan's leading industry?</p><p>Furthermore, the post-conflict scenario adds another layer of complexity. Assuming Taiwan emerges victorious, the task of reactivating the fabs hinges not only on the physical restoration of facilities but also on the return of the evacuated talent. The decision-making process for these engineers in the aftermath of geopolitical turmoil is inherently unpredictable. Factors such as attractive opportunities in other countries, personal circumstances stemming from the conflict, and the overall state of the global semiconductor industry could influence their willingness to return and re-engage with the Taiwanese fabs.</p><p>Therefore, the strategy of evacuating key personnel, akin to a 'boatlifting' tactic, presents a dilemma. While it might effectively deny critical assets to the invader in the short term, the long-term ramifications for Taiwan's semiconductor industry and economy are substantial. The assumption that these experts would seamlessly reintegrate and revitalise the industry post-conflict may be overly optimistic. Thus, Taiwan must carefully weigh the benefits of temporary invasion impedance against the potential for wider, lasting impacts on its economic vitality and technological leadership.</p><h2>D. Indirect protection of semiconductor assets</h2><p>Rather than directly protecting semiconductor assets, an alternative approach is pursuing indirect strategies that defend Taiwan's sovereignty, resulting in the semiconductor assets being shielded. The fundamental aim of the Taiwanese government is to prevent invasion, with actions regarding chips and foundries&nbsp;being the means to that end. If other means can protect sovereignty, the semiconductor assets may be safeguarded without direct action. Indirect approaches open up a wider range of politically and practically feasible options for Taiwan. In essence, under this view, while the Taiwanese government prioritises sovereignty above all, the protection of the semiconductor sector naturally follows as a byproduct of this focus.</p><p>External entities, distinct from the Taiwanese government itself, predominantly implement most indirect protective measures for Taiwan's assets.</p><h3>Economic sanctions</h3><p>The power of the economic shock delivered to Russia following its invasion of Ukraine came not so much from the sanctioning of their central bank but rather from the coordination of participating countries (<a href=\"https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2022/03/29/lessons-of-sanctions-on-russia-for-china/\"><u>Lubin, 2022</u></a>). While it is unknown exactly how much of their foreign reserves were lost, hundreds of billions of dollars were likely rendered inaccessible (<i>See Figure 2</i>; <a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/around-35-of-russias-accessible-reserves-in-country-china/2519923%23\"><u>Abay, 2022</u></a>). Unlike Russia, which faced severe economic challenges due to the sanctions, China benefits from a significantly stronger economy, which will be less appealing to sanctions. That said, China currently holds in excess of $3.2T in foreign reserves, the largest amount of foreign reserves in the world, and roughly 30% of global foreign reserves (<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/asia/china-forex-reserves-rise-3205-trln-april-2023-05-07/\"><u>Macro Matters, 2023</u></a>; <a href=\"https://data.imf.org/regular.aspx?key%3D61280813\"><u>IMF, 2023</u></a>; <a href=\"https://www.bbvaresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/20220915_China_optimal-foreign-reserve.pdf\"><u>Dong &amp; Xia, 2022</u></a>). While in absolute terms, this is undoubtedly a lot, relative to the size of its economy and the potential for large capital movements, this is not necessarily sufficient to safeguard against potential financial instability; hence, China continues to maintain significant control over capital outflow (<a href=\"https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2022/03/29/lessons-of-sanctions-on-russia-for-china/\"><u>Lubin, 2022</u></a>; <a href=\"https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2021/10/13/controlling-capital-during-covid-19/\"><u>Mercurio, 2021</u></a>).</p><p>At present, the exact currency composition of the Chinese reserve is kept secret by the People\u2019s Bank of China. Of this $3.2T, it is generally assumed that much is held in major currencies (i.e., USD, euro, yen and pound sterling - including holdings of $1.1T in US Treasury securities, $217B in Asset-Backed Securities, and $273B of equities; <a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/econographics/wargaming-a-western-freeze-of-chinas-foreign-reserves/\"><u>Tran, 2022</u></a>). If accurate, much of this will be vulnerable to US and EU sanctions.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:409.12px\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/u93z7vPbDmPQGnBSd/tf9jgb5uw0falvvnm0jy\" alt=\"\"><figcaption><i>Figure 2:</i>&nbsp;Distribution of Russian reserves among countries (<a href=\"https://www.aa.com.tr/en/asia-pacific/around-35-of-russias-accessible-reserves-in-country-china/2519923%23\"><u>Abay, 2022</u></a>).</figcaption></figure><p>Should China\u2019s foreign reserve be largely inaccessible, China will seek to mitigate the financial harm of this action. One approach could be the nationalisation of foreign direct investment (FDI) stock within China, which is valued at approximately $2.1T (<a href=\"https://santandertrade.com/en/portal/establish-overseas/china/foreign-investment\"><u>Santander, 2023</u></a>). This would, however, invite retaliatory action, which would put at risk up to $2.75T of their own outward FDI stock (<a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/865550/china-stock-of-direct-investments-abroad/%23:~:text%3DIn%25202022%252C%2520the%2520outward%2520FDI,billion%2520U.S.%2520dollars%2520in%25202011.\"><u>Statista, 2023</u></a>).

The effectiveness of such a strategy is unclear, with data reflecting the value of foreign domestic stocks and bonds held by Chinese investors being difficult to find. Despite the lack of precise figures, the substantial quotas for the Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) program and the Qualified Domestic Limited Partner (QDLP) program, which stood at a cumulative $220.7B as of June 2023, suggest a significant Chinese interest in foreign markets<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefeh8vjz0yn7\"><sup><a href=\"#fneh8vjz0yn7\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/banking-finance/article/3228123/chinese-investors-turn-foreign-stocks-and-bonds-domestic-economy-falters-and-shares-remain-flat\"><u>Ren, 2023</u></a>; <a href=\"https://www.ey.com/en_cn/strategy/10-key-trends-in-asset-management-industry\"><u>Zhang, 2023</u></a>).</p><p>Following Russia's precedent, China may halt external debt payments currently valued at around $2.7T (<a href=\"https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/econographics/wargaming-a-western-freeze-of-chinas-foreign-reserves/\"><u>Tran, 2022</u></a>). Indeed, China may argue that it is willing and able to pay the debt but is prevented from doing so by the actions of the United States government. The majeure clause could be invoked in specific external debt contracts. This would allow for the suspension of obligations if unforeseen government actions at the time of signing make it impossible for the contract\u2019s requirements to be fulfilled. However, this would inevitably carry significant reputational costs (<a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/force_majeure\"><u>Legal Information Institute, 2021</u></a>).</p><p>While these actions may or may not be particularly effective in recuperating capital, they would inflict significant financial harm. Prior economic conflict, albeit on a lesser scale, has shown the potential to cause significant damage; one notable example being the ongoing 2018 Trade War, which, by some estimations, resulted in a GDP reduction for the US and China by 1.35% and 1.41% respectively in its first year (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/aepr.12286\"><u>Itakura, 2020</u></a>). These retaliatory acts could either deter or fragment a unified approach to sanctions, likely far surpassing anything within Russia\u2019s capabilities.</p><p>Inevitably, such acts will be costly for China. Although China could theoretically achieve self-sufficiency, it needs more natural resources&nbsp;to maintain its current growth trajectory (<a href=\"https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/news/2023/03/producing-all-our-food-nationally-is-it-even-possible\"><u>Navarre, 2023</u></a>; <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1090951610000738?casa_token%3DNx2CpOA9A44AAAAA:ErW9qJMaxKT3zeCJ7-RK_d11HS_eRscIK5GVxNd8_z0u37whfM8asK9U5sYxTvzQB-iFUyKzBg\"><u>Ramasamy et al., 2012</u></a>). Long-term welfare aside, China is not yet self-sufficient, a reality acknowledged by the CCP and President Xi Jinping (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/mar/06/xi-jinping-urges-china-to-greater-self-reliance-amid-sanctions-and-trade-tensions\"><u>Davidson, 2023</u></a>). Moreover, self-sufficiency in key domains, such as maise production, could be many years away (<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-38355-2\"><u>Luo et al., 2023</u></a>). Should there be a strong global consensus to impose sanctions, it could lead to significant economic difficulties for China. However, sustaining the actions necessary to have a substantial long-term impact seems improbable. Even in the case of Russia, an easier target, notable economies allied with the United States, such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Thailand, refrained from sanctions (<a href=\"https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2022/05/30/as-the-world-sanctions-russia-china-takes-note/\"><u>Jiang, 2022</u></a>). Although the Russian economy is comparable in size to that of South Korea, the sanctions led to substantial disruptions in global commodity trade, potentially contributing to higher global inflation and weaker global growth (<a href=\"https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/economy/global-economic-impact-of-sanctions-on-russia.html\"><u>Kalish, 2022</u></a>).</p><p><i>Hence, while it is probable that sanctions would be imposed following an invasion and that these sanctions would be economically damaging for all involved - thereby lending credibility to the threat, it appears unlikely that such efforts could be effectively maintained.</i></p><h3>United States: Taiwan Relations Act of 1979</h3><p><i>We are making a minor point here about what could cause the US to intervene, but this report does not dive deep enough; we may engage with a \u2018US perspective\u2019 later, perhaps in a second part of this report.</i></p><p>The Sino-American Mutual Defense Treaty (<a href=\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/chin001.asp\"><u>1954</u></a>) established the U.S. dedication to defending Taiwan and the Penghu Islands<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefalte0bbvozf\"><sup><a href=\"#fnalte0bbvozf\">[7]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;This treaty persisted until 1979 when the U.S. officially acknowledged the People's Republic of China. However, pivotal components of the Mutual Defense Treaty were reincorporated in the Taiwan Relations Act (<a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/96/statute/STATUTE-93/STATUTE-93-Pg14.pdf\"><u>1979</u></a>). This U.S. legislation pledges to supply Taiwan with 'defensive weaponry' and sustain the ability to counter any use of force or coercion against Taiwan. Its phrasing is more strategically vague than its 1954 predecessor. Thus, the Taiwan Relations Act does not unambiguously promise U.S. military intervention if Taiwan is invaded. However, it establishes some U.S. commitment to involvement in Taiwan's defence, though less unequivocal than its predecessor pact (<a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/the-taiwan-relations-act/\"><u>Brookings, 2004</u></a>).</p><h3>International law</h3><p>Irrespective of Taiwan's official status as a state, Nguy\u1ec5n (<a href=\"https://usali.org/usali-perspectives-blog/does-international-law-protect-taiwan\"><u>2022</u></a>) contends that under international law, specifically Article 2(4) of the UN Charter and UNGA Resolution 2625, the use of force in violation of the right to self-determination is prohibited. Therefore, any aggressive attempt to alter Taiwan's governance would constitute a breach of international law. Furthermore, Taiwan is regarded as a stabilised \u201cde facto\u201d state (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/35855/chapter/308177926\"><u>Chen, 2016</u></a>), which is argued to possess a comparable right to self-defence, including the possibility of collective self-defence by its allies (<a href=\"https://www.lowyinstitute.org/the-interpreter/would-war-over-taiwan-be-legal\"><u>Saul, 2021</u></a>).</p><p>This interpretation suggests that the international mandate for states to settle their disputes peacefully extends to interactions with a de facto state like Taiwan. Moreover, the recognition of the Taiwanese as a \u201cpeople\u201d with a distinct identity entitled to self-determination underscores the island's right to decide its political future free from Chinese pressure. Notably, despite most Taiwanese sharing Han Chinese ancestry with the people of mainland China, the significant period of political autonomy has fostered a unique societal identity.</p><p>Nonetheless, historical patterns illustrate recurrent infringements of such legal statutes, questioning their effectiveness as preventive measures. The international community's potential resistance to China's misappropriation of the self-defence clause to justify forceful actions against Taiwan also comes into consideration. However, history has not deterred similar precedents despite the legal complexities potentially undermining China's rationale.</p><p>Regarding domestic dynamics within China, it is conceivable that the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) could effectively persuade its populace to view international legal institutions and the United Nations as mere extensions of US influence. This perception could undermine the legitimacy of UN interventions. In the event of a conflict involving a major power such as China, the efficacy of UN resolutions, particularly those subject to China's veto power in the General Assembly, may be significantly constrained, as has been observed historically in conflicts involving major powers.</p><p>Ultimately, while a forceful takeover of Taiwan would violate international laws, these have frequently been disregarded and seem intractable in preventing a Chinese aggression.</p><h1>V. Appendix: Open Questions</h1><ol><li>For China, a swift invasion of Taiwan appears unlikely (<a href=\"https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2021/02/26/mainland-china-is-in-no-position-to-take-taiwan-by-force/\"><u>Lei, 2021</u></a>). War would likely be very costly,&nbsp;with economic sanctions presenting a risk to the CCP\u2019s reputation (see <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/u93z7vPbDmPQGnBSd/evaluating-taiwan-s-tactics-to-safeguard-its-semiconductor-1#D__Indirect_protection_of_semiconductor_assets\"><i><u>Indirect protection of semiconductor assets</u></i>;</a> <a href=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/military/article/3082825/too-costly-chinese-military-strategist-warns-now-not-time-take\"><u>Chan, 2020</u></a>). With this in mind, it is more likely that China will pursue cross-strait integration by favour, not by force (<a href=\"https://www.eastasiaforum.org/2020/09/12/cross-strait-integration-by-force-or-favour/\"><u>Chiu, 2020</u></a>). Naturally, this preference aligns with that of Taiwan; Taiwan\u2019s National Development Council has placed the protection of the semiconductor industry as a central policy in its 2021-2024 National Development Plan (<a href=\"https://www.ndc.gov.tw/en/Content_List.aspx?n%3D2D827BFE7E3598BE%26upn%3D4D3DA452D04C42CC\"><u>National Development Plan, 2020</u></a>). One avenue to protect its semiconductor stock could be for Taiwan to engage in a gradual, drawn-out process of reunification with China. Given that a primary motive for China's potential invasion is the concept of a 'unified China', as outlined in the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/u93z7vPbDmPQGnBSd/evaluating-taiwan-s-tactics-to-safeguard-its-semiconductor-1#I__Introduction\"><i><u>Introduction</u></i></a><i><u>, </u></i>a commitment to a slow reunification could potentially defuse the immediate threat. How useful/tractable is this to safeguard Taiwan's semiconductor fabs?</li><li>One uncertainty in this strategy is the proximity of the PRC to gaining control over Taiwan's semiconductor fabs when Taiwan is deemed to be on the brink of defeat. At what stage of the conflict would Taiwan be considered close to defeat, and would this not imply that the PRC is already in a position to take over these critical facilities? Understanding the exact scenario where Taiwan is on the verge of defeat, yet still retains control over its semiconductor fabs is crucial. This assessment is vital to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of employing sabotage as a last resort without it being too late to prevent the PRC from seizing these valuable technological assets.</li><li>It could be useful to have more work done that looks at the extent to which the specialised equipment or the specialised expertise in fabs are actually hard to replicate or seize.</li><li>In the context of a conflict, where Taiwan employs strategies to impede an adversary while potentially impacting its own semiconductor production capacity, a question emerges: To what extent would Taiwan be capable of operating its semiconductor fabs under these conditions? Moreover, even if an operation is feasible, how would Taiwan navigate the complexities of exporting semiconductor products amidst the disruptions of war? This question probes the practicality of maintaining semiconductor production and the logistics of export in a wartime economy, balancing the need to fund the conflict against the challenges posed by the conflict itself.</li></ol><h1>VI.

It is a 7-month programme enabling ambitious graduates to launch European policy careers reducing risks from artificial intelligence. From 2024, it will run twice per year. It includes:</p><ul><li><strong>8-week training</strong> that explores the intricacies of AI governance in Europe</li><li>A week-long&nbsp;<strong>policymaking summit in Brussels&nbsp;</strong>to connect with others working in the space</li><li><strong>6-month placement</strong> at a prominent think tank working on AI policy (e.g. The Centre for European Policy Studies, The Future Society)</li></ul><h2>Success to date</h2><p>The EU Tech Policy Fellowship appears to have had a significant impact to date. Since 2021, we\u2019ve supported ~30 EU Tech Policy Fellows and successfully transitioned a significant number to work on AI governance in Europe. For example:</p><ul><li>Several work at key think tanks (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thefuturesociety.org/\"><u>The Future Society</u></a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://icfg.eu/\"><u>International Center for Future Generations</u></a>, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ceps.eu/\"><u>Centre for European Policy Studies</u></a>)</li><li>One has co-founded an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://kira.eu/\"><u>AI think tank</u></a> working directly with the UN and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2023/04/18/the-world-needs-an-international-agency-for-artificial-intelligence-say-two-ai-experts\"><u>co-authored a piece for The Economist with Gary Marcus</u></a></li><li>Others are advising MEPs and key institutions on the EU AI Act and related legislation</li></ul><p>We\u2019re conducting an external evaluation and expect to publish the results in early 2024. Initial indicators suggest that the programme has been highly effective to date. As a result, we have decided to double the programme\u2019s size by running two cohorts per year. We now expect to support 30+ fellows in 2024 alone.</p><h2>Future directions</h2><p>We can imagine Talos Institute growing in a number of ways. Future activities could include things like:</p><ul><li>Creating career advice resources tailored to careers in European policy (especially for those interested in AI &amp; biosecurity careers). Similar to what&nbsp;<a href=\"https://emergingtechpolicy.org/\"><u>Horizon has done in the US</u></a>.</li><li>Community-building activities for those working in AI Governance in Europe (eg. retreats to facilitate connections, help create shared priorities, identify needs in the space, and incubate new projects).</li><li>Hosting events in Brussels educating established policy makers on risks from advanced AI</li><li>Activities that help grow the number of people interested in considering policy careers focused on risks from advanced AI, e.g. workshops like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bald-elf-6f3.notion.site/Impactful-Policy-Careers-54ad72be1d444f198f9884c4e9b084ad\"><u>this&nbsp;</u></a></li><li>Expanding beyond AI governance to run similar placement programmes for other problems in Europe (e.g. biosecurity).</li><li>Establishing the organisation as a credible think tank in Europe. |This would involve hiring researchers in-house and producing useful object-level output.</li><li>Producing media and content related to AI governance in EU</li></ul><p>It\u2019s unclear how promising any of the above activities would be.

Many of these questions are more classic forecasting questions, others have the same shape but are unresolvable, still others look more like research projects or like suggestions of data gathering efforts. Below we give some recommendations of what to do with this list, mainly to feed them into forecasting and research pipelines. In a <a href=\"https://nunosempere.com/blog/2023/11/07/hurdles-forecasting-ai/\">separate document</a>, we outline reasons why using forecasting for discerning the future of AI may prove particularly difficult.</p>\n<h2>Table of Contents</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Recommendations</li>\n<li>Questions\n<ul>\n<li>Recurring terms</li>\n<li>Key</li>\n</ul>\n<ol>\n<li>Questions relevant to speed of capabilities progress</li>\n<li>Questions relevant to safety and alignment</li>\n<li>Regulation and Corporate Governance</li>\n<li>Who will be at the forefront of AI research?</li>\n<li>Questions about militarization.</li>\n<li>Questions about how agent-y and general future AIs will be, and how that affects X-risk from AI</li>\n<li>Risks of various kinds from EAs and other people concerned about AI X-risk getting things wrong</li>\n<li>General Warning Signs</li>\n<li>Chance and Effects of Deliberately Slowing AI Progress</li>\n<li>Questions about public and researcher opinion</li>\n<li>EA Opinion relevant issues:</li>\n<li>AI effects on (non-AI takeover) catastrophic and X-risks in international relations</li>\n<li>Miscellaneous</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Recommendations</h2>\n<p>We recommended that Open Philanthropy feed these questions into various forecasting and research pipelines, with the thought of incentivizing the research needed to come up with good models of the world around AI developments.</p>\n<p>We have categorized questions with three stars in various buckets, each of which has its own recommendations:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Questions marked by (FE), are good targets for Fermi estimates. In isolation, each of those Fermi estimates might not mean much, but in aggregate, a bunch of them might contribute to having better models. Open Philanthropy could put bounties for good Fermi estimates on these questions, or solicit bids from researcher interested in doing Fermi estimates.</li>\n<li>Questions, marked by (RP), require more involved research to arrive at a high-quality answer. They could be a good fit for institutions that can produce research that takes longer, like think tanks, research fellowships, etc.</li>\n<li>Questions, marked by (FT), are good fits for forecasting tournaments. These could be put up on a platform, like Manifold Markets, Polymarket, or Metaculus. A forecasting group, like Samotsvety, could also be useful for questions where there is no clear resolution method. In <a href=\"https://github.com/NunoSempere/clarivoyance/blob/master/list/resolution-council.md\">this adjacent document</a>, we also outline a \"resolution council\", which could subjectively resolve questions which would otherwise have no resolution source.\n<ul>\n<li>Metaculus previously had a <a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/tournament/ai-progress/\">large AI tournament</a>, which seems to have seen bounded success. It is possible that Manifold would be able to more capably set up a similar tournament, in a way that would be better across many dimensions, so if you only have capacity for a single forecasting platform, we would recommend putting these questions up on Manifold this time for the value of information.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Some questions, marked by (UF), have a similar shape to a forecasting question, but they might be unresolvable or too difficult to resolve. If might be worth commissioning a forecasting group like Samotsvety to forecast on them.</li>\n<li>Some questions, marked by (DG), are good targets for data gathering, in the style of Our World In Data (OWID). Perhaps OWID itself could be commissioned to gather and present some of this data. Other groups, like Epoch or AI impacts, might also be interested in looking into this.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note that the boundary between questions which could be in a forecasting tournament (FT), and questions which we deem to be unresolvable with a reasonable amount of effort (UF) is fairly arbitrary. Fewer questions would be suitable for a forecasting tournament on a platform like Metaculus, which seeks to have explicit and rigorous questions. More would be suitable for a tournament or list of questions on Manifold Markets, which has more of an \"anything goes\" attitude.</p>\n<p>We have also worded many questions in terms of a \"resolution council\", which would make them more resolvable, if you had a resolution council willing to go through the effort of coming up with a subjective judgment on the question topic. For an explanation of what a resolution council could be, see <a href=\"https://github.com/NunoSempere/clarivoyance/blob/master/list/resolution-council.md\">here</a></p>\n<h2>Questions</h2>\n<h3>Recurring terms</h3>\n<p>An specification for a [resolution council] is discussed in a separate document, <a href=\"https://github.com/NunoSempere/clarivoyance/blob/master/list/resolution-council.md\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>\"Leading lab\" is defined as a lab that has performed a training run within 2 orders of magnitude of the largest ever at the time of the training run, within the last 2 years.</p>\n<p>A floating point operation (FLOP) is here defined as one addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division of two decimal numbers, whatever their size. So doing subtracting two 64 bit floats would here correspond to one FLOP, as would subtracting two 8 bit \"mini-floats\". See <a href=\"https://github.com/NunoSempere/clarivoyance/blob/master/list/flops.md\">this document</a> for a short discussion of this point.</p>\n<p>\"Automating some fraction of labour\" is operationalized as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Consider all human work hours in 2023 and their intended outputs. Then at the question resolution year, when aiming to produce the same types of outputs, how many fewer human hours will one need to achieve the same kind of output, or a close substitute?</li>\n<li>For example, consider all hours spent on secretary work in 1960. This work commonly requires much less time, since people no longer dictate to secretaries, and instead draft emails themselves. But some labour is still needed, so we might estimate that 95% of that work has been automated.</li>\n<li>Note on substitutability: McDonald's uses some screens for customers to place orders, and together with a counter, this substitutes for waiters. However, these don't provide exactly the same experience of a waiter: the waiter might be more attentive, or add a \"human touch\". For cases such as this, consider the work to have been automated, even if it has been replaced by a close rather than exact automated substitute.</li>\n<li>Note on effort required for question resolution: The above operationalization means that questions using it might need a small research project to estimate a resolution. But then, it's also possible that in the course of researching this topic, one could come up with better operationalizations of \"labour automated\".</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Key</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\u2605\u2605\u2605 = Highest Importance</li>\n<li>\u2605\u2605  = Medium Importance</li>\n<li>\u2605   = Lower Importance</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Questions relevant to speed of capabilities progress</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>\u2605\u2605 Exotic computing techniques 1: What is the chance that (at least one of) the leading commercially available GPU chip(s) are 3-d by 2031?

personal capacity. My goal in writing this is to give the community a sense of what someone from a decent-sized local EA group is going through during a time of national crisis. I'll try to keep the post relatively apolitical, but since this is such a charged topic, I'm not sure I'll succeed. I will say that I\u2019m quite nervous about the responses to the post, since the forum can sometimes lean towards criticism. Ideally, I\u2019d want people who are reading this to do so with a sense of compassion, while keeping in mind that this is a difficult time and difficult topic to post or share experiences about. I also don't want the comments to be a discussion of the war per se, but of the experiences of an EA during the war. Finally, I'm sure that an individual from Gaza will be having a very different experience, which I respect and would be interested in hearing, but in this post I'm not trying to capture all possible experiences, but to share a part of mine and my community\u2019s.&nbsp;</p><p>These are my views and thoughts, and not the official position of the organization or of my team members. I wrote this on my phone around November 18th, since I\u2019ve been without much access to a computer. I haven\u2019t had a chance to update it or spend lots of time editing, so I apologize in advance if it feels lacking in polish.&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for bearing with me during the preambles.</p><h1>So what have I been doing since the outbreak of the war?</h1><p>Since the terrorist attacks on Oct. 7, and the ongoing hostage situation and frequent rocket attacks, life in Israel and in the community has changed drastically. Many know someone who was killed or is a hostage, the majority of men (and many women as well) aged 18-40 have been called up to reserve duty, and the entire country has been in a state of trauma and mourning. For the first few weeks, most commercial activity in Israel stopped, schools were closed, and people went to funerals. Adjusted for population size, the Hamas attacks were 13 times more deadly than 9/11.</p><p>Personally, I've been called up to the army, along with another EA Israel team member, a board member, and the husbands of two others on our team. I've been home only sporadically for the past 6 weeks. My wife and 2 year old son are alone, and are struggling emotionally. I've been to one funeral, of someone from my local (non EA) community. My cousin, who lives in a city that was attacked on Oct 7th, was locked in the bomb shelter in his apartment for 16 hours with his wife and four children, and heard his neighbours being violently murdered. Thank God, somehow the terrorists passed over them, and they've been living in a hotel since then.&nbsp;</p><p>Many people who I know from the global community have reached out to me and the team to see that us and our families are safe, which felt good. On the other hand, I\u2019m not sure how much the average in EA in Israel (or Gaza) feels cared about by the global EA community. I'd be happy to see some sort of statement of concern for the wellbeing of EA community members in a conflict zone.</p><p>Our work at EA Israel has mostly paused. Talking about global priorities seems less relevant during wartime, and most of our staff isn't available to work on projects. The university semester is suspended. We've been involved in a few projects trying to help with prioritising donations, a board member wrote a post about donations, and are trying to launch a donation optimisation project with a major foundation. We\u2019ve done some work on mapping the mental health needs in Israel for foundations, and were invited to present it at the Knesset (parliament), but nothing major has come to fruition. We've been holding weekly virtual community meetings and had our first in person meeting since the start of the war this week, but since there are often rocket sirens it's difficult to arrange in person meetings. Obviously, our planned December community retreat and spring EAGx have been canceled. Grants that we expected to receive didn't materialize because of the regional instability, including for our <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BLqJdZAgsvyWX7fug/local-charity-evaluation-lessons-from-the-maximum-impact\">charity evaluation program</a>, which we were in the middle of fundraising for and now might have to close down. Recently we've begun slowly ramping up our regular activity with the staff members who are available, but it will be a gradual process.</p><h1>How has my experience changed the way I think about EA concepts?</h1><p>So far, it appears to me that some of the tools EA has developed to make decisions that optimise general wellbeing don't translate well to a crisis situation, which has made me feel a bit disappointed. As a worldview that guided much of my thinking about how to act, EA is often irrelevant in the current situation. This has played out in a few ways.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Donation recommendations</strong></h2><p>Israel has seen an outpouring of support via philanthropy (the government hasn't functioned especially well). There are plenty of causes to support within Israel - mental health, hundreds of thousands of displaced people, supporting a struggling economy, etc. This should be an opportunity where EA-based principles would have enormous value! People are giving at incredibly high scales, and we could help them give more effectively! But, with a situation changing so rapidly, and little information about the effectiveness or neglectedness of different donations, we at EA Israel found that we don\u2019t have much to say. We\u2019ve done charity evaluation in Israel, but in order to reach the standard of evidence we feel necessary to provide concrete value to donors, the evaluation requires time, and an understanding of the philanthropic ecosystem, both of which aren't relevant when things are moving so rapidly. Even donations to Gazans or other Palestinians in need are of uncertain effectiveness due to the political considerations preventing aid from reaching its destination.</p><h2><strong>Important aspects of suffering aren't captured by usual metrics</strong></h2><p>Although I try not to think about the horrors of the attack, it's clear to me that to be brutally murdered in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/10/why-israeli-officials-screened-footage-hamas-attack/675735/\"><u>ways like this</u></a> is worse than dying of a naturally occurring disease.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefoeptvtwc1ec\"><sup><a href=\"#fnoeptvtwc1ec\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I don't know what metric to use to prove this, but to me it seems self-evident. The sense of tragedy and trauma in Israel is so much stronger now than it was during Covid, even though less people have died. And I don't think it's because people can't multiply, I think it's because violence feels much more horrible than disease. Not to mention being held hostage or tortured or raped by a terrorist organization.</p><h2><strong>There's even more moral uncertainty</strong></h2><p>The main goal of my day job is to improve lives as much as possible. Yes, there are decisions to be made about cause prioritisation, animal vs human suffering, how much to discount the long-term, etc etc. These are questions that I've thought through, more or less, and read a lot about, and I\u2019m mostly at peace with my conclusions, updating occasionally. &nbsp;</p><p>During wartime, my value system is much more confused. Hoping that suffering and death are kept to a minimum is still dominant. But now I also think much more about good and evil, and if stopping evil can justify many lives lost (if yes, how many? How do you even start to answer that?). I want justice for the terrorists who committed atrocities on women and children. I also feel national lines and tribalism much more strongly. I both relate to and understand it, having had family in life threatening danger, and also find it to be wrong and misleading and easy to slip into a mindset where I care more about \u201cmy people\u201d than I want to. In general, for me, there's much less clarity on what \u201cthe right thing\u201d is. This is during a time where there's a war of narratives raging, and many people reduce the complexity by just picking a side. My moral compass hasn't found North, and unfortunately I don't think it will anytime soon.</p><h2><strong>Caring about people far away can go wrong if the topic is trending</strong></h2><p>From what I've seen of the global coverage of the war, it seems that everyone has a strong opinion on who's at fault. Most of those people have no idea what's going on, and may be acting against the best interest of the people they claim to care about. They've expanded their moral circle, but are lacking the knowledge and context to express their care in a way that actually improves the situation or matches the facts of the ground. If we were to compare to GHWB, hearing Peter Singer and being convinced to expand the moral circle isn't enough, you also need GiveWell to help you guide your actions in order to have a positive impact. It\u2019s easy to be emotional, loud and ignorant when addressing the suffering of someone far away, or when seeing pictures of children suffering. This is an area where I really appreciate EA thinking - there's a deep understanding that helping others is hard, and we should do it carefully and quietly and honestly, with a lot of self reflection. Especially in a global world, caring needs to come with a lot of humility, and maybe a dose of rationality.</p><h2><strong>Models of complex situations can be overly simplistic and harmful</strong></h2><p>There's an ongoing debate within AI safety about whether public protests and support for a pause are good or bad for safety in practice, which is a healthy debate on a complex topic. The same debate should be had for interpower conflicts. I've seen a claim that by using the ITN framework, publicly protesting for a cease-fire is a clear cut way to make the situation better. Low effort, medium tractability, not insignificant scale.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm more skeptical. Popular support often needs a clear goal to have traction, and in this case, the clear goal of the public protests is a long term ceasefire. Which sounds good initially - a long term ceasefire means less fighting and less death, which is a good thing.&nbsp;</p><p>But. It seems to me that such a model misses much of the context of the war. Why did it start? What does each side want? What are the consequences of pressuring a side to accept a long term ceasefire before they are ready? I don't have a great answer to any of these questions, but there are enough negative scenarios that make me skeptical that public support for a long term ceasefire will be net positive in practice, and isn't just fuzzies for people hearing about a horrible situation and looking for some way, any way, to act. The theory of change here sounds plausible, but doesn't take into account second order effects.</p><p>There's at least one potential scenario that comes to mind in which protests end up being net negative in the long run. If global protests cause an early long term ceasefire, in the short term, fighting will stop, and lives will be saved. However, terror groups all over the world will learn that if they embed themselves within a civilian population, take hostages and use human shields, Western public opinion will protect them from a military response for even the most barbaric of attacks. In the long run, the chance of more frequent and more vicous attacks, and the use of human shields, will go up significantly, leading to even higher death tolls.&nbsp;In game theory there are often differences between single round games and multiround games, and unfortunately, this looks like a multiround game.</p><p>I don't have any idea what the right balance is between not empowering terror and civilian lives, and I'm very thankful that I don't have to be the one to make decisions on life and death policy questions. What is clear to me that pushing for simple solutions to complex policy decisions can easily backfire, and that models that don't take into account second order effects or understand the responses of the actors are probably deeply flawed. The OpenAI saga (from what I've been able to glean from the headlines) looks like an all too recent example of this.</p><h2><strong>Optimisation is irrelevant</strong></h2><p>During the past few weeks in the army, I've been struck by how much I need to adjust my tendency to try and optimize. The army doesn't think in terms of cost-effectiveness at all, while I instinctually start doing expected value BOTECs wherever I am. At first I tried calculating the cost-effectiveness of being called up to the army. Reserve soldiers cost X, logistics cost Y, lost earnings cost Z, vs the value of my unit's role (hint: not especially important). But after a while, I realised that the army in real-time has no concept of cost. They've been given a mission, and that's the only thing they care about. Since the cost of losing the war is huge, you either can't do cost-effectiveness calculations or the conclusion of the calculation is to simply let the money flow. So basically the army is pascal-mugging everyone, which is strangely comforting.</p><p>Personally, the place where my usual way of thinking clashes most painfully with army thinking is how I view the value of my time. In regular life, I think a lot about how to optimise my time. In the army, most of the time I wait. This is while my wife is struggling with a two year old who refuses to nap because he's waiting for Dad to come home. It feels that my time is more valuable at home, where I have an immediate impact on the wellbeing of the people I care about most. But if my being in the army somehow helps return the hostages taken by Hamas, even in a very roundabout way, I feel obligated to stay, even though most of my days I feel I could be contributing much more at home.</p><h2><strong>Ambition to improve the world</strong>&nbsp;</h2><p>Two weeks before the war started I chatted with someone in the park on a Saturday, each of us holding a baby stroller. Two weeks later, I see his picture in the news with details about his funeral. Life seems more fragile. Something that shouldn't be taken for granted. Just waking up, knowing my family is healthy and that I'm loved by them, having basic food and shelter, is enough for me to feel satisfied and grateful. How very much of a contrast this state of mind is to the amount of energy and stress I expended on work projects, and to the slumps of mild depression during periods I didn't feel I was succeeding at having an impact.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't know how this will play out long term, once the war ends. Maybe I'll go back to how things were, or maybe I'll be even more motivated to fix one of the many places where the world is incredibly messed up. I'm grateful that I can even contemplate returning to work on improving the world, which wouldn't be the case if I was a tax lawyer (no offense). But for now, my ambition sums up to living quietly in a shack with my wife and watching my son grow up.</p><h2><strong>The importance of peace&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>I've been brought up Jewish, and peace comes up often during Jewish prayer. Only now do I understand how key peace is to all other values. May there be peace soon.<br><br><br>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnoeptvtwc1ec\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefoeptvtwc1ec\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>A therapist friend commented that the emotional trauma from interpersonal violence is generally much greater than the emotional trauma from disasters that are \u201cacts of God\u201d, so apparently there is some literature to support this.</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "ezrah"}}, {"_id": "FnNJfgLgsHdjuMvzH", "title": "EA Infrastructure Fund's Plan to Focus on Principles-First EA", "postedAt": "2023-12-06T03:24:54.553Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Edit 2024/01/02: <strong>People who like this new vision may want to consider </strong></i><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/en-US/funds/effective-altruism-funds\"><i><strong>donating to EAIF</strong></i></a><i><strong>!&nbsp;</strong></i></p><p><i>Now until the end of January is an unusually good time to donate, as it allows you to take advantage of </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zt6MsCCDStm74HFwo/ea-funds-organisational-update-open-philanthropy-matching\"><i>2:1 Open Phil matching</i></a><i> ($2 from them for $1 from you)</i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/linch#fn0vlfyfv2ai2\"><i><sup>[1]</sup></i></a><i>.

The EA Infrastructure Fund (formerly known as the EA Community Fund or EA Meta Fund) has given out 499 grants worth about 18.9 million dollars since the start of 2020. Throughout its various iterations, the fund has had a large impact on the community and I am proud of a number of the grants we\u2019ve given out. However, the terminal goal of the fund has been somewhat conceptually confused, which likely leads to a focus and allocation of resources often seemed scattered and inconsistent.</p><p>For example, EAIF has funded various projects that are associated with meta EA. Sometimes, these are expansive, community-oriented endeavors like local EA groups and podcasts on effective altruism topics. However, we\u2019ve also funded more specialized projects for EA-adjacent communities. The projects include rationality meetups, fundraisers for effective giving in global health, and AI Safety retreats.</p><p>Furthermore, in recent years, EAIF also functioned as a catch-all grantmaker for EA or EA-adjacent projects that aren\u2019t clearly under the purview of other funds. As an example, it has backed early-stage global health and development projects.</p><p>I think EAIF has historically served a valuable function. However, I currently think it would be better for EAIF to have a narrower focus. As the lead for EA Funds, the bottom line of EAIF has been quite unclear to me, which has made it challenging for me to assess its performance and grantmaking quality. This lack of clarity has also posed challenges for fund managers in evaluating grant proposals, as they frequently face thorny philosophical questions, such as determining the comparative value of a neartermist career versus a longtermist career.</p><p>Furthermore, the lack of conceptual clarity makes it difficult for donors to assess our effectiveness or how well we match their donation objectives. This problem is exacerbated by us switching back to a more community-funded model, in contrast to our previous reliance on significant institutional donors like Open Phil<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9u1n0o5zlta\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9u1n0o5zlta\">[4]</a></sup></span>. I expect most small and medium-sized individual donors to have less time or resources to carefully evaluate EAIF\u2019s grantmaking quality despite the conceptual confusions. Likewise, grantees, applicants, and potential applicants may be confused due to uncertainty about what the fund is looking for.</p><p>Finally, having a narrower purpose clarifies the areas EAIF does not cover, allowing other funders to step in where needed. Internally, having a narrower purpose means our fund managers can specialize further, increasing the efficiency and systematization of grant evaluations.</p><p>Here is my proposal for the new EAIF vision, largely focused on principles-first EA (or at least my interpretation of principles-first EA). I believe this gives a clearer bottom line for the fund, whilst complementing the work done by other orgs nicely, and is currently a neglected perspective by other EA funders.</p><h1>Proposal</h1><p>The EA Infrastructure Fund will fund and support projects that build and empower the&nbsp; community of people trying to identify actions that do the greatest good from a scope-sensitive and impartial welfarist view. In general, it will fund a mixture of activities that:</p><ol><li>Increase the number of people trying to do an ambitious amount of good using evidence and reason, with a focus on scope sensitivity, impartiality and radical empathy. This is mainly achieved by expanding the Effective Altruism community, though not exclusively.</li><li>Help these individuals allocate their resources, or otherwise do good, in the most altruistically impactful way.</li></ol><h2>Examples of projects under the new EAIF\u2019s purview</h2><ul><li>Research that aids prioritization across different cause areas<ul><li>Initiatives such as 80,000 Hours and Probably Good</li><li>A retreat for researchers in nascent fields (like ethics concerning digital minds) where the outputs may be helpful in determining whether the EA community should devote more resources towards expanding those fields.</li></ul></li><li>Projects that help grow the EA community.<ul><li>Local and university-based EA groups with high epistemic integrity&nbsp;</li><li>An op-ed discussing the world's most pressing issues from an Effective Altruism viewpoint.</li></ul></li><li>Infrastructure, especially epistemic infrastructure, to support these aims<ul><li>Guesstimate</li><li>Manifold Markets</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Examples of projects that are outside of the updated scope</h2><p>Here are some examples of \u201cmeta\u201d projects that may have been within the current EAIF\u2019s purview, but I think will fall outside of the new scope.

California investor-owned utilities are regulated monopolies responsible for purchasing and distributing electricity across the state. Three utilities cover most of the state, with Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&amp;E) being the largest.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefg7utjmio4ve\"><sup><a href=\"#fng7utjmio4ve\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>The field has many possible parallels to the current and possible future landscape for frontier AI labs. Some possible similarities are listed below (though some may become dissimilarities depending on how the AI field evolves).</p><ul><li>Catastrophic wildfire risk is posed by a small number of companies in California (three utilities cover most of the state).&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4zu4e7190an\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4zu4e7190an\">[2]</a></sup></span></li><li>It is infeasible to fully eliminate catastrophic wildfire risk (at least in short-medium term).</li><li>The risk of catastrophic wildfires has quickly increased in the past two decades.</li><li>During this time, risk levels and the individual sources of risk have been highly uncertain (though they are better understood now).</li><li>The cost and effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies has also been largely unclear.</li><li>Safety standards partially resemble a licensing scheme, with approval based on a fairly subjective evaluation across a wide range of metrics.</li><li>Safety measures can accompany economic tradeoffs for the general public (namely higher electricity rates).</li><li>Reputational risks play an important factor for utilities, as the largest utilities are well known by the general public and the risk posed by such companies is widely discussed in California media and politics.</li></ul><p>This case study aims to highlight examples of company actions and regulator successes and challenges in this (potentially) similar environment, to help calibrate our expectations for AI company behavior and the risks and opportunities for safety standard strategies.</p><p>Based on my research, the following features of safety standard development on California utilities to prevent catastrophic wildfires should provide (further) caution for AI safety standard setting:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://ai-case-study.vercel.app/#1\">Creating and enforcing standards while building regulator and company capacity has been a lengthy process (even after motivation among all parties was high).</a></li><li><a href=\"https://ai-case-study.vercel.app/#2\">Companies and regulators did not sufficiently internalize and respond proactively to catastrophic risk as it rose (even when there were many indications that risk was growing).</a></li><li><a href=\"https://ai-case-study.vercel.app/#3\">Events that look like warning shots in hindsight generally did not spark sufficient urgency around safety; only the largest and most direct disasters spurred significant regulation.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://ai-case-study.vercel.app/#4\">Motives have been mixed and varied, but reputational risk and concern for public welfare have not alone been as influential as profit motive for all companies.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://ai-case-study.vercel.app/#5\">Regulators were too slow to address uncertainty about the level and source of catastrophic risk (though sources of risk are much better understood now).</a></li><li>It can be highly challenging for regulators to create a system with quick enough feedback loops that:<ul><li><a href=\"https://ai-case-study.vercel.app/#6\">incorporates past utility performance into annual regulatory sign off, and</a></li><li><a href=\"https://ai-case-study.vercel.app/#7\">allows for the regulator to update guidelines on safety best practices (while evidence for the cost and effectiveness of various safety strategies is limited and changing).</a></li></ul></li></ul><p>This case study also explores possible benefits and challenges of several regulatory strategies that could be relevant for the AI field.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://ai-case-study.vercel.app/#8\">Strict, no-fault, legal liability on utilities has been hugely important in shaping utility incentives. Still, it hasn't forced all utilities to take sufficient safety precautions.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://ai-case-study.vercel.app/#9\">In the face of legal liability, penalties (or their threat) do not appear to have played an important role in motivating utility behavior, though some suggest they could be used more frequently and strongly.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://ai-case-study.vercel.app/#10\">California's dependence on utilities for (affordable) electricity has limited regulator leverage to extract safety actions.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://ai-case-study.vercel.app/#11\">Tying executive pay to safety outcomes can be a replicable model.</a></li><li>Establishing regulation of catastrophic risk in a different regulatory body from the body that authorizes funding has created a range of possible benefits and challenges. It may have:<ul><li><a href=\"https://ai-case-study.vercel.app/#12\">helped raise the competence of safety regulation and utility focus on safety practices,</a></li><li><a href=\"https://ai-case-study.vercel.app/#13\">contributed to limiting clarity among all parties on how utilities should best handle safety and economic tradeoffs, and</a></li><li><a href=\"https://ai-case-study.vercel.app/#14\">created bureaucratic challenges that must be navigated between various regulators.</a></li></ul></li></ul><p>Finally, the case study highlights:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://ai-case-study.vercel.app/#15\">how private activists have seemingly played an important role in shaping safety standards, despite years of being rebuffed, and</a></li><li><a href=\"https://ai-case-study.vercel.app/#16\">how voluntary safety actions by (primarily) one utility have helped inform safety policies and raised expectations for other utilities.</a></li></ul><h2><strong>Contents</strong></h2><p>This case study is structured as follows:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://ai-case-study.vercel.app/#17\">The problem that safety standards aim to address.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://ai-case-study.vercel.app/#18\">Current standards.</a></li><li><a href=\"https://ai-case-study.vercel.app/#19\">More details on each of the key findings listed above, organized by theme (e.g. </a><a href=\"https://ai-case-study.vercel.app/#20\">proactivity vs reactivity</a>, <a href=\"https://ai-case-study.vercel.app/#21\">utility motives</a>, etc.).</li></ul><h1><strong>The need for safety standards</strong></h1><ul><li>California wildfires cause significant death and destruction.<ul><li><a href=\"https://calmatters.org/california-wildfire-map-tracker/\">Since 2008</a>, California wildfires have killed 225 people and damaged or destroyed more than 50,000 structures.

More concerningly, regulators have generally not mandated substantially stricter safety standards for utilities until that utility has caused a disaster. <strong>Some events that look like \u2018warning shots\u2019 in hindsight did not sufficiently spur urgent safety improvements.</strong><ul><li>Events that drew attention to catastrophic threat but failed to spur significant action include the following:<ul><li>San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&amp;E) equipment&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-sdge-wildfires-20170112-story.html\"><u>sparked a wildfire</u></a> in 2007 that killed two people and destroyed more than 1,500 homes. This prompted the utility to significantly increase its focus on fire prevention. The fire also increased CPUC efforts to increase safety standards on all utilities, but resulted in little meaningful regulatory change.</li><li>In 2015, PG&amp;E equipment sparked the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fire.ca.gov/incidents/2015/9/9/butte-fire/\"><u>Butte fire</u></a> that killed two people. The CPUC did not not require PG&amp;E to create a wildfire safety plan until mandated by legislation in 2017. By the time its first WMP was completed (2019), the utility had already caused devastating fires in 2017 and 2018. (<i>See more about the history of increasing fire risk and the evolution of safety standards&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://ai-case-study.vercel.app/#evolution\"><i><u>here)</u></i></a><i>&nbsp;</i>.</li><li>PG&amp;E was found to have deficiencies in its safety culture and practices in its gas department, which led to a pipeline explosion that killed six people in 2010 (for which the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://abc7news.com/pge-fine-pacific-gas-and-electric-san-bruno-fire-explosion/1722674/\"><u>company was convicted</u></a> on six felony charges). This triggered significant efforts to improve the gas department\u2019s safety practices. This could have piqued investigations into the company\u2019s electricity safety culture, too. (While I\u2019m not certain as to whether such investigations occurred, no significant regulation forced improvements to PG&amp;E\u2019s (deficient) safety culture and practices related to electrical equipment during this time.)<ul><li>The Attorney prosecuting PG&amp;E following the 2018 Camp Fire (which killed 85 people) concluded that \u201ca nearly identical dynamic had manifested within the electric transmission division\u201d as the gas division, where workers felt pressure to cut operating and inspection costs, leading to insufficient safety checks.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzgbjfhkj3j\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzgbjfhkj3j\">[3]</a></sup></span></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>The pattern likely extends beyond California:</strong> One expert I spoke with (Michael Wara) believes this pattern \u2013 whereby utilities fail to sufficiently take precaution (or be forced by regulators to act) until they\u2019ve caused a catastrophic fire \u2013 has been playing out for utilities across the country, too. In Hawaii, for example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/michaelwwara/status/1709717342115057841?s=48&amp;t=jvABLpmiJy24m6BINifJrQ\"><u>Hawaiian Electric</u></a> decided against using Public Safety Power Shutoffs to prevent catastrophic wildfire (as is used by California utilities) and deemed its coverage area to be less prone to catastrophic fires than California.

(<i>See more details about activist involvement and proposed policies&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://ai-case-study.vercel.app/#15\"><i><u>here</u></i></a>). The process was slow, adversarial, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/pge-california-wildfire-safety-pushback/\"><u>resulted in limited regulation</u></a> (especially on PG&amp;E) during the late 2000s and most of the 2010s.<ul><li><a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/pge-california-wildfire-safety-pushback/\"><u>In 2012</u></a>, the CPUC required Southern California Edison (SCE) and SDG&amp;E to create fire prevention plans. It did not require PG&amp;E to create such a plan, but required that PG&amp;E make a \u201cgood faith\u201d effort to determine if such a plan was needed. PG&amp;E determined a plan was not necessary, but submitted a six-page summary of a prevention and mitigation plan.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/pge-california-wildfire-safety-pushback/\"><u>In 2014</u></a>, amid ongoing drought, the CPUC mandated that utilities report each fire started by its equipment (as opposed to only reporting fires more than 100 acres, the rule at the time).

Energy Safety&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.auditor.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2021-117.pdf\"><u>argued</u></a> that holding the utility to a higher standard would be unrealistic and result in denied WMPs for years. \u201cWithout approved plans, the utilities cannot be held accountable for the progress promised in those plans and denial would prevent them from implementing incremental progress over their prior approved plan. Instead, Energy Safety evaluates utility improvement over the previous year and, if sufficient, approves the WMP while providing clear direction on how to mature the capability going forward.\u201d</li></ul></li><li>Current oversight and standards are imperfect but hugely improved and improving: All experts I spoke with agree the process is significantly more effective at reducing wildfire risk compared to several years prior, though still a work in progress. Several suggested that Energy Safety is highly competent, and has built internal capacity as quickly as could be expected. Although wildfire risk from utility equipment is still meaningfully high, they indicated that it is significantly reduced and all parties involved are committed to continual safety improvements. (It should be noted that these experts may have bias from working with Energy Safety).</li></ul><p>_____________________________________</p><h2><strong>Utility motives</strong></h2><ul><li>On its surface, the California utility market appears more likely than most capitalist markets to be one in which companies prioritize public welfare, including for the following reasons:<ul><li>Utilities have a highly regulated business model.</li><li>Wildfire risk has become clear after utilities have caused deadly catastrophes.</li><li>Utilities face significant reputational challenges. PG&amp;E in particular has received significant negative publicity for many years related to wildfires. Its employees live among their customers, and according to one expert, employees have faced significant safety concerns while in the field due to apparent threats from members of the general public.</li></ul></li><li>Still, while experts believe public welfare and reputational concerns have played a role in utility decisions, most decisions (especially by PG&amp;E) would be best predicted by utilities\u2019 profit maximizing incentive structure, including consistent underspending on maintenance.<ul><li>California investor-owned utilities are regulated monopolies. Through a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/industries-and-topics/electrical-energy/electric-rates/general-rate-case\"><u>General Rate Case</u></a> proceeding every four years, utilities propose electric revenue based on their anticipated expenses.<ul><li>For approved capital investments, utilities are allowed to recover costs plus a fixed profit.</li><li>For operating expenditures, utilities are only allowed to recover the projected expenditure without profit. However, if operating expenditures come in below the previously approved amount, these savings become utility profits.</li><li><strong>Public reporting and experts I interviewed consistently found this business model to be a principal reason for consistent underspending on maintenance, which has (fairly directly) led to catastrophic fires.</strong></li></ul></li><li>PG&amp;E behavior in particular has been consistently characterized by profit seeking motives. This point has been widely stated, including in this New York Times Article \u201c<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/03/18/business/pge-california-wildfires.html\"><u>How PG&amp;E Ignored Fire Risks in Favor of Profits</u></a>.\u201d Some illustrative anecdotes include the following:<ul><li>In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/03/18/business/pge-california-wildfires.html\"><u>discussing</u></a> resistance to regulation during the 2010s, a PG&amp;E utilities commissioner described of PG&amp;E: \u201cThere was very much a focus on the bottom line over everything: \u2018What are the earnings we can report this quarter?\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd things really got squeezed on the maintenance side.\u201d</li><li>In describing the history of PG&amp;E leading up to its 2019 bankruptcy, author Katherine Blunt described \u201cA series of executives had sought to please investors and politicians, often at the expense of customers. By the time the company confronted the risks of its aging electric grid, the problems were staggering.\u201d&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyj0oncuu2er\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyj0oncuu2er\">[5]</a></sup></span></li><li>Even following bankruptcy, PG&amp;E\u2019s choices for executives appear to prioritize profit over safety. In a letter to the company, Governor Newsom indicated he was \u201ctroubled to learn that PG&amp;E is primed to reconstitute its board with hedge fund financiers, out-of-state executives and others with little or no experience in California and inadequate expertise in utility operations, regulation and safety. With this move, PG&amp;E would send a clear message that it is prioritizing quick profits for Wall Street over public safety and reliable and affordable energy service.\u201d The company moved forward with the appointments anyway.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrbjxz5wh0rp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrbjxz5wh0rp\">[6]</a></sup></span></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Experts indicated that legal liability \u2013 established by courts rather than the legislature \u2013 has proved substantially more influential on company behavior than public penalties.<ul><li>Due to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.counties.org/sites/main/files/file-attachments/csac_issue_brief_inverse_condemnation_7-25-18.pdf\"><u>California court decision</u></a>, utilities are legally required to reimburse wildfire victims for damages from fires started by utility equipment&nbsp;<i>regardless of whether the utility was at fault</i>. My interpretation from expert discussions is that the threat of legal liability has significantly (though not always sufficiently) motivated utilities to reduce wildfire threat, once the utility acknowledged the risk.</li><li>The liability stems from \u201cinverse condemnation,\u201d which is a legal concept that flips the idea of eminent domain and establishes that property owners are entitled to compensation if their property is damaged to serve a public purpose. A California court determined that the liability applied to investor-owned utilities in 1999, if their equipment sparks a wildfire that damages private property.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5s7d2rtd5eq\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5s7d2rtd5eq\">[7]</a></sup></span></li><li>This liability (among other possible reasons), appears to have successfully motivated at least one utility (SDG&amp;E) to voluntarily prioritize safety efforts (described further&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ai-case-study.vercel.app/#16\"><u>here).</u></a> In contrast, it has not led to sufficient safety priority for PG&amp;E, and led to the company declaring&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/07/01/business/energy-environment/pge-bankruptcy-ends.html\"><u>bankruptcy in 2019</u></a> when facing up to $30 billion in liabilities for fires started by poorly maintained equipment.</li><li>Legislation in 2019 established the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cawildfirefund.com/#:~:text=The%20California%20Wildfire%20Fund%20exists,caused%20by%20the%20participating%20utility.\"><u>California Wildfire Fund</u></a>, which effectively serves as insurance against very large liabilities. Utilities can draw from the fund for liabilities above $1 billion. Utilities are advantaged in this process if they have a safety certification from Energy Safety, as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.auditor.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2021-117.pdf\"><u>described in more detail</u></a> by the California State Auditor below.<ul><li>\u201cParticipating utilities may seek payment from the Wildfire Fund to satisfy third-party claims for covered wildfires that exceed the greater of $1 billion in any year or the amount of insurance the utility must maintain. State law requires participating utilities to maintain reasonable insurance coverage, the amount of which the fund administrator must periodically review and recommend. In general, utilities must reimburse the fund for costs that the CPUC determines are not just and reasonable. By law, utilities with a valid safety certification for the period in which the wildfire ignited are presumed to have acted reasonably, and if the CPUC determines the costs for which they claim reimbursement are not just and reasonable, the amount the utility must reimburse the Wildfire Fund is capped. However, if the CPUC determines that the utility\u2019s costs were not reasonable and it did not have a safety certification or the fund administrator determines that its actions or inactions constituted a conscious or willful disregard of the rights and safety of others, the utility must reimburse the Wildfire Fund in full.\u201d</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Tying executive pay to safety outcomes may meaningfully influence utility behavior, but the mechanism by which this is done may make an important difference.<ul><li>Energy Safety requires utilities to submit executive payment plans, which are approved if they are shown to be dependent on safety outcomes (though utilities have some freedom on how to interpret this).&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefblskywu91o8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnblskywu91o8\">[8]</a></sup></span><ul><li>Following bankruptcy, PG&amp;E was given the additional requirement to base a \u201csignificant component of long-term incentive compensation on safety performance.\u201d</li></ul></li><li>One expert (Michael Wara) suggested such a program would be much more influential if executive pay was also required to follow a long-term (e.g. 10+ year) vesting schedule, such that executives would lose significant pay if the company failed to avert long-term catastrophic risks.</li></ul></li></ul><h2><strong>Activists and third parties</strong></h2><ul><li>Even when activists concerned about tail risks had little early success (from what I can tell), their proposals appeared to set the foundation for later standards.<ul><li>In 2008, the CPUC hosted public proceedings aimed at preventing wildfires caused by utilities (as described well in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/pge-california-wildfire-safety-pushback/\"><u>this article</u></a>). During the proceedings, activists proposed rules that were initially rejected but later adopted in some form. Their proposals were to require that utilities:<ul><li>Report each fire started by its equipment (as opposed to only reporting fires more than 100 acres, the rule at the time).

The CPUC finally required such maps in 2018 (again, following pushback from PG&amp;E and SCE), though not in as detailed a form as required in safety advocates' proposals.</li><li>Create contingency plans for extreme winds that can cause catastrophic fires. This proposal appears to have set the foundation for requirements for fire prevention plans on SDG&amp;E and SCE in 2012, and later WMPs on all utilities starting in 2019 (though I have not definitively confirmed this point).</li></ul></li><li>These activists may have been motivated by a combination of factors including self-preservation (having previously been affected by California wildfires), public safety, and monetary motivations (they reportedly received significant compensation over many years from the CPUC&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/-/media/cpuc-website/divisions/administrative-law-judge-division/documents/icomp-materials/updated-icomp-program-guide-april-2017.pdf\"><u>intervenor compensation program</u></a>, discussed below).</li></ul></li><li>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/-/media/cpuc-website/divisions/administrative-law-judge-division/documents/icomp-materials/updated-icomp-program-guide-april-2017.pdf\"><u>CPUC intervenor compensation program</u></a> \u2013 which pays individuals and organizations when their input has been useful to a CPUC proceeding \u2013 could be a replicable model to build an ecosystem of third party experts.<ul><li>The advocates described above&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/pge-california-wildfire-safety-pushback/\"><u>estimated</u></a> that they received close to $700,000 from the CPUC, as of 2020.</li><li>To receive payment from the program, one must&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/-/media/cpuc-website/divisions/administrative-law-judge-division/documents/icomp-materials/updated-icomp-program-guide-april-2017.pdf\"><u>provide</u></a> \u201csubstantial contribution\u201d to a CPUC proceeding.</li><li>My impression from speaking with Tom Long of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.turn.org/\"><u>TURN</u></a> (a legal advocacy organization that works with the CPUC and receives funding from the program) is that this program has been important to the develop the ecosystem of third party organizations providing expertise for the CPUC and Energy Safety (though he mentioned that Energy Safety does not currently have a program like the intervenor compensation program).</li></ul></li></ul><h2><strong>Regulatory structure, processes, and challenges</strong></h2><ul><li>Energy Safety was deliberately created to be a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://energysafety.ca.gov/who-we-are/about-energy-safety/\"><u>separate regulatory body</u></a> from the CPUC to focus on regulating wildfire risk by California utilities. My impression from conversations with experts is that having a narrowly safety-focused organization has helped build significant regulatory expertise and make progress establishing a robust oversight process. One expert also suggested the system creates a healthy tension between Energy Safety\u2019s focus on efficient risk reduction and the CPUC\u2019s focus on spending efficiency.<ul><li>Following legislation requiring WMPs, the CPUC&nbsp;<a href=\"https://energysafety.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/docs/strategic-roadmap/final_report_wildfiremitigationstrategy_wsd.pdf\"><u>initiated a project</u></a> in 2019 to \u201ccreate a vision, strategy, and roadmap to outline its efforts to systematically reduce the risk of ignition of wildfires from utility infrastructure.\u201d This included establishing a Wildfire Safety Division, which transitioned into the office of Energy Safety in 2021.</li><li>Experts indicated to me that the creation of Energy Safety as a body solely focused on wildfire risk from utilities was an explicit attempt to \u201cdisentangle\u201d safety and financial concerns. One expert also indicated that it reflected the legislature\u2019s lack of trust in the CPUC to oversee utilities regarding safety.</li><li>Through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/industries-and-topics/electrical-energy/electric-rates/general-rate-case\"><u>General Rate Case</u></a> proceedings every four years, the CPUC authorizes utilities to collect a certain amount of revenue from ratepayers based on planned expenditures. As such, the CPUC has direct influence over whether or not utilities can recoup funds to execute their proposed WMPs.</li><li>Energy Safety does not have the ability to impose penalties, rather they&nbsp;<a href=\"https://energysafety.ca.gov/what-we-do/electrical-infrastructure-safety/compliance/wildfire-mitigation-plan-compliance/\"><u>may determine</u></a> that a utility \u201cis not in compliance with its approved wildfire mitigation plan,\u201d and \u201cmay recommend that the CPUC pursue an enforcement action against the electrical corporation for noncompliance with its approved plan.\u201d</li></ul></li><li>Still, separating the primary safety regulator from the agency that controls funding for safety measures has led to several challenges, too. Experts indicated that utilities may have insufficient clarity for how to respond to conflicting directions between the safety regulator and the agency that controls funding.<ul><li>Investments to reduce wildfire risk can lead to higher electricity prices for the public (since California utilities, as regulated monopolies, are typically allowed to pass costs on to customers).</li><li>Since the CPUC determines (through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/industries-and-topics/electrical-energy/electric-rates/general-rate-case\"><u>General Rate Case</u></a> proceedings every four years) the amount that utilities can recoup from ratepayers, its decisions are integral to the feasibility of utility WMPs.</li><li>The tension has been particularly clear during current proceedings. PG&amp;E has put&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pgecurrents.com/articles/3858-10-000-miles-undergrounding-bold-idea-2021-significant-progress-2023\"><u>significant focus</u></a> on undergrounding power lines to improve wildfire safety in recent years. Their 2023-2025 WMP proposal included&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/pg-e-and-sce-s-wildfire-mitigation-2999883/\"><u>significant spending increases</u></a> (as did SCE\u2019s, though my impression is that SCE is focused less on undergrounding). Experts indicated that the costly focus on undergrounding likely reflects PG&amp;E\u2019s profit incentives, whereby they make a regulated profit on capital expenses, but not on operating expenses (like cutting vegetation near power lines). They indicated to me that cheaper \u2018<a href=\"https://undergroundinfrastructure.com/magazine/2010/july-2010-vol-65-no-7/features/hardening-power-lines\"><u>hardening</u></a>\u2019 techniques are likely more appropriate (despite them doing slightly less to reduce risk), as utility savings would result in cheaper electricity rates.<ul><li>This point is also supported by an SCE study (referenced on page 25&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.auditor.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2021-117.pdf\"><u>here</u></a>) indicating that \u201ceach dollar spent replacing existing bare power lines with covered lines provided four times as much value in wildfire risk mitigation as a dollar spent on converting the bare lines to underground power lines.\u201d</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>One expert indicated to me that the cost and effectiveness of safety-enhancing strategies has been highly uncertain (though perhaps less so today than it used to be). The separate processes and different timelines between Energy Safety and the CPUC appear to risk slowing safety investments and reduce Energy Safety's flexibility to quickly update guidance as the cost and effectiveness of various safety strategies becomes clearer.<ul><li>Utility safety investments are largely beholden to CPUC decisions every four years approving the level of investment utilities can recoup from rates. There is no clear mechanism for updating rates between every four-year decision, which may limit Energy Safety\u2019s ability to mandate continuous safety improvements on a year-to-year basis as evidence on best practices changes.</li><li>The CPUC is currently reviewing PG&amp;E\u2019s General Rate Case proposal, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/news-and-updates/all-news/cpuc-releases-two-pds-in-response-to-pge-request-for-new-investments-2023\"><u>has indicated</u></a> that it is considering two options for how PG&amp;E should balance undergrounding and \u2018hardening\u2019 strategies. Neither option would approve the full spending proposed by PG&amp;E. One expert indicated to me that while PG&amp;E awaits the CPUC\u2019s decision, PG&amp;E does not know how much it can recoup for 2023 spending, which has slowed its safety investments this year.</li></ul></li><li>Lengthy auditing and investigation periods that reduce regulators\u2019 ability to update oversight strategies appear to be particularly costly amid these uncertainties. For example, Energy Safety appears to have incomplete information about utilities\u2019 compliance with the prior year\u2019s WMP when evaluating its subsequent WMP.<ul><li>Especially during the 2010s, the slow regulatory process hindered safety progress. It took a decade for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/business/energy-green/sd-fi-sdge-wildfirecaseruling-20171130-story.html\"><u>CPUC to rule</u></a> that SDG&amp;E was at fault for devastating 2007 fires. One expert indicated that this \u201cprecedent had huge consequences for all three of the state\u2019s largest utilities\u2014especially PG&amp;E,\u201d&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxnq8zns50hr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxnq8zns50hr\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and it seems possible that such a precedent could have spurred more attention to safety earlier, had SDG&amp;E been found to be at fault more promptly.</li><li>Even in recent years, Energy Safety appears to have incomplete information about utility compliance with prior WMPs when evaluating subsequent WMPs. For example, Energy Safety only released a review of PG&amp;E\u2019s compliance with its 2020 WMP in February 2023.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefz4droxuv2lc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnz4droxuv2lc\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(It found \u201cthat PG&amp;E failed to substantially comply with its 2020 WMP, which \u201chindered its ability to reduce the risk of catastrophic wildfire on its system.\u201d)<ul><li>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.auditor.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2021-117.pdf\"><u>2022 report</u></a> from the California State Auditor highlighted the challenges caused by this delayed evaluation. It stated (on page 35) \u201cwhether a utility substantially implements the projects in its mitigation plan has no bearing on the issuance of its safety certification as a result of these two factors: first, because the implementation of the plan is in progress, the Energy Safety Office performs only a limited review of whether a utility is implementing its current mitigation plan, and second, determinations of whether a utility substantially implemented its prior mitigation plans are not one of the criteria established in law for it to assess when issuing a safety certification.\u201d</li><li>In response, Energy Safety suggested that it did not believe it to be necessarily useful to include compliance with the most recent WMP in its subsequent WMP evaluation, stating the following: \u201cGiven the constantly evolving understanding of how best to address utility wildfire risk, any findings in the \u201cmost recently completed compliance assessment\u201d may not be directly relevant or applicable to utilities\u2019 maturing wildfire strategies. Using the safety certification as a backward-looking, punitive enforcement action could undermine its value as a stabilizing incentive to invest in safety and, as the Report states, \u201csupport credit worthiness,\u201d which enables utilities to raise capital at a lower cost to make those investments.\u201d (available on page 75,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.auditor.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2021-117.pdf\"><u>here</u></a>).</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Regulation is also challenged by the state\u2019s dependence on utilities. This case study highlights the risk of using a licensing scheme to regulate companies that become \u2018too-important-to-fail.\u2019 Failing to issue safety certifications to utilities that insufficiently mitigate catastrophic risk would threaten utilities' financial standing and could lead to higher electricity prices.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftuahd89gax\"><sup><a href=\"#fntuahd89gax\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This may make regulators reluctant to deny certification, thereby reducing pressure on utilities to fully comply with safety standards. (A similar challenge could emerge if governments and businesses become dependent on (updates to) AI systems).<ul><li>While experts indicated to me that Energy Safety would be highly averse to denying safety certification to a utility (and they have not yet done so), they do still put significant pressure on utilities to raise their safety capabilities. One expert indicated to me that the WMP evaluation process is a \u201cnegotiation, not a binary decision.\u201d Several experts suggested the cost of compliance for utilities is quite high, and utilities are very concerned about the threat of failing to receive certification.</li><li>At least in prior years, though, Energy Safety has held utilities to a lower standard. This appears to me to correspond with Energy Safety building its internal capacity and forcing utilities to continually improve safety capabilities at a rate Energy Safety feels is feasible.<ul><li>In 2020, Energy Safety (conditionally) approved utilities\u2019 WMPs despite identifying \u201cserious deficiencies in each of their mitigation plans\u201d (from page 35,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.auditor.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2021-117.pdf\"><u>here</u></a>).</li><li>Energy Safety argued that holding the utility to a higher standard would be unrealistic and result in denied WMPs for years - ultimately delaying its progress. \u201cWithout approved plans, the utilities cannot be held accountable for the progress promised in those plans and denial would prevent them from implementing incremental progress over their prior approved plan. Instead, Energy Safety evaluates utility improvement over the previous year and, if sufficient, approves the WMP while providing clear direction on how to mature the capability going forward\u201d (from page 75,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.auditor.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2021-117.pdf\"><u>here</u></a>).</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2><strong>Influence of voluntary safety actions</strong></h2><ul><li>Early voluntary safety practices by San Diego Gas and Electric (SDG&amp;E) appear to have influenced subsequent safety standards applied to all large utilities. SDG&amp;E&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/03/18/business/pge-california-wildfires.html\"><u>upgraded fire prevention efforts</u></a> after it was sued by residents for causing a devastating wildfire in 2007. Since then, it undertook a wide range of voluntary safety practices, and was significantly more supportive of regulation attempts than other utilities, especially PG&amp;E.<ul><li>SDG&amp;E&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.psehealthyenergy.org/news/blog/preventing-wildfires-with-power-outages-2/\"><u>requested approval</u></a> from the CPUC to use&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/psps/\"><u>Public Safety Power Shutoffs</u></a> (PSPSs) for fire prevention in 2008, but was denied. The CPUC allowed utilities to use PSPSs starting in 2012, and they have since become an important (though undesirable) fire prevention tool for utilities.</li><li>\u2018Reclosers\u2019 - devices that try to reclose a circuit after a fault occurs on a power line, are another example of a voluntary policy becoming part of safety standards (after a disaster, in this case). SDG&amp;E and SCE have long&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/pge-california-wildfire-safety-pushback/\"><u>had policies</u></a> to block reclosers during fire season. PG&amp;E did not have such a policy before its reclosers may have contributed to a 2017 fire that killed three people. This led to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id=201720180SB901%27\"><u>bill</u></a> requiring safety policies for reclosers.</li><li>More broadly, state officials&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/03/18/business/pge-california-wildfires.html\"><u>have reportedly indicated</u></a> that SDG&amp;E could serve as a template for PG&amp;E as it relates to safety measures. In the late 2010s, PG&amp;E\u2019s vice president for community wildfire safety said PG&amp;E often used SDG&amp;E\u2019s approach to implement safety policies.</li><li>SDG&amp;E was more supportive of policies&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/frontline/article/pge-california-wildfire-safety-pushback/\"><u>proposed by activists in 2008</u></a> than other utilities, though it is unclear to me whether its support was influential, as the policies were not implemented until many years later.</li></ul></li><li>Regulators cite peer utilities\u2019 safety practices when evaluating WMPs. This competitive pressure appears to embed (sometimes voluntary) best practices into safety standards.<ul><li>One expert indicated to me that the WMP process was designed such that the period for public commitment could allow comparison between utilities to create a race-to-the-top dynamic.</li><li>The following quote from Energy Safety\u2019s Revision Notice to PG&amp;E\u2019s proposed 2023-2025 WMP provides one example of how utilities are evaluated against one another.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxu1r7zujnz\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxu1r7zujnz\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Energy Safety requires PG&amp;E undertake \u201cbenchmarking with SCE and SDG&amp;E with respect to hazard tree mitigation practices. PG&amp;E then must report in its Revision Notice Response on the similarities and differences between the three electrical corporations\u2019 hazard tree mitigation practices. Where these practices differ, PG&amp;E must explain why its practices differ from those of its peers. PG&amp;E must also describe any changes it plans to make because of this exercise and a timeline to implement those changes.\u201d</li></ul></li></ul><h2><strong>Risk assessment</strong></h2><ul><li>For many years, regulators and utilities appear to have had insufficient urgency to develop a robust and detailed risk identification and prioritization methodology, though risks are dramatically better understood and modeled today.<ul><li>As one example, it took roughly&nbsp;<a href=\"https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/maui-fire-lays-bare-utility-missteps-mirrored-across-the-country\"><u>ten years</u></a> for maps of high risk areas to be created after regulators began such an effort in 2008.</li><li>In the late 2010s, one expert described to me that the CPUC underwent a process for better risk identification and assessment (across all utility activities, not just wildfire safety). The expert indicated that the utilities were adversarial during the process, including strongly (but unsuccessfully) resisting the proposal for risks to be quantified.</li><li>Experts indicated that risks are much better mapped and modeled today than in previous years. Utilities are responsible for modeling risk, and regulators rely on experts for detailed review of utility models.</li><li>Still, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.auditor.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2021-117.pdf\"><u>2022 California State audit suggested</u></a> that Energy Safety didn\u2019t require clear enough prioritization of high risk activities: \u201cthe office approved utilities\u2019 2020 and 2021 mitigation plans even though the utilities had not provided sufficient information on how they used risk modeling outcomes to inform decision-making processes, circuit prioritization for mitigation efforts, and mitigation selection.\u201d</li><li>This may have changed in the past two years, as one expert suggested that risk modeling now acts as an umbrella over WMP evaluation, and increased focus on risk modeling has become a core piece of making safety policies more proactive.</li></ul></li><li>Still, some experts argue that risk models may focus too heavily on median wildfire risk rather than potential catastrophic fires.<ul><li>One expert indicated that fire risk models - while highly detailed - are still better suited for modeling the average type of fire, and fail to simulate extreme cases well. Another expert said that utilities have the choice to submit two types of analyses, one on tail risk and one on mean risk. The expert said they generally chose to submit an analysis of the mean risk (which partially covers tail risk). This expert indicated that the degree to which tail risk should motivate decision makers is an ongoing question.</li><li>In October 2023, too, a longtime activist and wildfire safety consultant released a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0379711223001479\"><u>paper</u></a> arguing that models \u201cincorrectly prioritize risk drivers\u201d and \u201cfail to represent large fires due to limited run time.\u201d It is not clear to me how widely held this belief is among experts.</li></ul></li></ul><h2><strong>Audits and penalties</strong></h2><ul><li>After causing a devastating wildfire, utilities generally face penalties from the CPUC and courts (if they were found to be at fault), in addition to being liable for damages caused to victims. Penalties from courts have generally been small relative to utility revenues. Some CPUC penalties have been much larger, though they are still much smaller than liabilities facing utilities after causing a wildfire.<ul><li>Laws that limit fine sizes appear to have kept court-issued penalties to relatively small totals.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefatb6x99a4k8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnatb6x99a4k8\">[13]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; Despite being convicted of 84 counts of manslaughter after its old equipment sparked the Camp Fire, for example, PG&amp;E was only fined&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/06/16/business/energy-environment/pge-camp-fire-california-wildfires.html\"><u>$3.5 million</u></a> by the court (PG&amp;E had a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/PCG/pacific-gas-electric/gross-profit\"><u>~$17 billion</u></a> annual gross profit from 2022-2023). In her book&nbsp;<i>California Burning</i>, Katherine Blunt described several examples in which lawyers attempted to pursue meaningfully large penalties against utilities but were limited by statutory maximums.</li><li>Penalties issued by the CPUC against utilities can be meaningfully large, though my impression is their threat is not nearly as influential on utility behavior as potential liabilities utilities face after causing a fire. This&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cpuc.ca.gov/news-and-updates/all-news/cpuc-staff-propose-$45-million-penalty-for-pge-over-dixie-fire\"><u>partial list</u></a> of penalties issued against PG&amp;E shows several over $100 million, and the largest reached&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.utilitydive.com/news/cpuc-imposes-largest-ever-penalty-of-19b-on-pge-for-northern-california/577625/#:~:text=The%20California%20Public%20Utilities%20Commission,grim%20chapter%20in%20PG%26E's%20history%2C%E2%80%9D\"><u>$1.9 billion</u></a> following PG&amp;E sparking the Camp Fire that killed 85 people. Still, these pale in comparison to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/01/business/energy-environment/pge-dixie-fire.html#:~:text=PG%26E%20filed%20for%20bankruptcy%20protection,town%20of%20Paradise%20in%202018.\"><u>tens of billions</u></a> of dollars in liabilities that utilities have faced after causing devastating fires.</li></ul></li><li>The CPUC does not appear to substantially use audits and penalties to punish utilities for failing to comply with its WMP.<ul><li>Audits are conducted by a range of actors at various (including random) times. This appears to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://energysafety.ca.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022-wmp-compliance-process.pdf\"><u>include</u></a> field inspections conducted by Energy Safety, annual compliance reports conducted by the utility, an audit by an independent evaluator hired by the utility (from an approved list), and vegetation management audits conducted by Energy Safety. One expert also indicated to me that some individual counties also conduct their own auditing. I don\u2019t believe this list above is exhaustive, as experts have mentioned other CPUC and Energy Safety audits that don\u2019t necessarily fit into those categories above.</li><li>Still, a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.auditor.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2021-117.pdf\"><u>2022 report</u></a> by the California State Auditor suggested that the CPUC audits could be more consistent and better targeted: \u201cMoreover, the CPUC conducts audits to determine whether utilities are in compliance with rules designed to ensure that they are operating safely, but those audits could be improved to better ensure such compliance, thereby helping mitigate the risk of utility\u2011caused wildfires. Specifically, the CPUC does not consistently audit all areas in the utilities\u2019 service territories, it did not audit several areas that include high fire-threat areas.\u201d</li><li>It also appears that the CPUC does not meaningfully issue penalties when it finds utilities are failing to execute their WMPs. The same&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.auditor.ca.gov/pdfs/reports/2021-117.pdf\"><u>report</u></a> stated that the CPUC \u201cdoes not use its authority to penalize utilities when its audits uncover violations.\u201d The following bullet points from the same report provide examples (bolding by me).<ul><li>\u201cIn 2014 the CPUC adopted an electric safety citation program that gave staff the authority to issue penalties for certain violations of law and of General Orders, including those identified through audits. However, as of November 2021, the CPUC had not issued any penalties resulting from violations that its safety and enforcement division found during audits. The safety and reliability program manager informed us that it is the CPUC\u2019s practice to issue penalties for significant issues, which may be found through incident investigations where individuals were hurt or killed, or where buildings were destroyed, but that these types of immediate safety hazards are rarely found during audits.\u201d</li><li>\u201cIn our review of CPUC audits, we identified several instances where the CPUC identified violations of General Orders that were the same as those for which it issued penalties in incident investigations. For example, the CPUC issued a $2.5 million penalty to a utility in 2021 for nearly 55,000 violations of a General Order requiring inspections of distribution poles, and we found that the CPUC had identified similar issues in at least two of its distribution district audits. The CPUC identified more than 200 violations of the same General Order in one 2020 distribution district audit, and about 2,400 similar violations in a second 2020 distribution district audit. Additionally, we found that in 2017 the CPUC issued a $50,000 penalty to a utility for a single violation of a General Order requiring vegetation management. Although we identified three audits that the CPUC performed in 2019 and 2020 that identified similar violations, it did not issue any penalties for those violations.\u201d<br>&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fng7utjmio4ve\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefg7utjmio4ve\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>This case study focuses on safety standards on the three largest utilities and may not accurately represent standards applying to smaller utilities.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn4zu4e7190an\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref4zu4e7190an\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>This may or may not be a parallel to the AI field in the future.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnzgbjfhkj3j\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefzgbjfhkj3j\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Katherine Blunt, California Burning, 2022.

You can view the most up-to-date version on the High Impact Engineers website.</i></p><p>Would taking on a PhD allow me to have more impact in my career? This is one of the questions we\u2019re most often asked in career conversations.</p><p>With research-related work being emphasised in both <a href=\"https://www.highimpactengineers.org/begin-your-journey\"><u>our advice</u></a> and in <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/skills/research/#top\"><u>other guides to having more impact</u></a>, a PhD might be a good way to build skills and credentials in this area. But taking on a PhD has some significant downsides and there are other ways of getting involved in research.</p><p>Here are some general advantages and disadvantages to taking on a PhD:</p><h2>Reasons to Do a PhD</h2><h3>The Research can be Impactful</h3><p>The theories and innovations that have shaped the modern world all originated from researchers, and doing well-targeted, excellent research can save lives and <a href=\"https://effectivethesis.org/how-can-research-change-the-world/\"><u>positively shape the future</u></a>.</p><p>However, even if your PhD thesis won\u2019t change the world by itself, work from University research groups can be extremely impactful. Pursuing a PhD provides access to these groups, to academics who are usually very knowledgeable, and sometimes to equipment or facilities that would be difficult to find elsewhere.</p><h3>Sharpening Research Skills</h3><p>Doing a PhD builds skills in research and in domain-specific knowledge, which is often an <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/skills/research/#:~:text=need%20quantitative%20ability).-,Why%20is%20a%20research%20skill%20set%20valuable%3F,most%20valuable%20skill%20sets%20to%20build%20%E2%80%94%20if%20you%E2%80%99re%20a%20good%20fit.,-Research%20seems%20to\"><u>effective path to impact</u></a>. This experience gives you the ability to lead advanced projects in specific technical dimensions.</p><h3>Sharpening Transferable Skills</h3><p>PhDs sharpen skills for specific topics but also provide some generally useful and transferable skills, which are mostly communication-oriented. Through doing a PhD, a lot of time will be spent on knowledge-centric tasks and building up knowledge-centric communication skills, which are usually quite useful.</p><h3>Landing a Technical Career</h3><p>For a future career using skills such as in-depth thinking, strategic thinking, using a data-driven and evidence-based approach, or doing knowledge-based work, having a PhD is useful. If you are aiming for knowledge/R&amp;D/abstract/technology-driven profiles, having a PhD has a high value.</p><h3>Landing a High-Paid Career</h3><p>Jobs available after receiving a PhD are <a href=\"https://www.findaphd.com/guides/phd-employability\"><u>usually highly paid</u></a> relative to Masters degree holders, which helps with long-term financial security and for <a href=\"https://www.highimpactengineers.org/blog/maximising-impact-through-effective-donations\"><u>effective giving</u></a>. PhD holders also generally have <a href=\"https://www.amacad.org/publication/humanities-graduate-education-workforce/section/30\"><u>high job satisfaction</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><h3>Signalling</h3><p>A PhD is a widely recognised credential that adds to legitimacy in many contexts, including academic research and <a href=\"https://www.highimpactengineers.org/blog/5-valuable-engineering-skillsets-for-policy\"><u>policy work</u></a>.</p><p>A university or research institute affiliation is required to present at many conferences and to submit to many journals. These are both excellent ways to disseminate your research and add credibility to your work. Conferences also have the added advantage of exposing you to cutting-edge research in your field and building your network. Peer-reviewed publication is seen as the gold standard for legitimacy, so for your research to be taken seriously by those outside of your field it can be extremely helpful.</p><h3>Freedom to Direct and Structure Your Work</h3><p>The self-driven nature of the work suits self-motivated people who don\u2019t enjoy overly structured working environments.&nbsp;</p><p>Many PhDs offer the candidate a lot of agency in choosing their PhD topic. For many people this will be the only time in their life where they can work full time on a largely unconstrained self-selected topic.</p><h3>Working in the University Environment</h3><p>Completing a PhD is the main path to pursue teaching at third level.</p><p>Universities are often quite comfortable places to work and are often based in more wealthy areas with good local services.</p><p><img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/2YPKiEBYCbRD38ruF/mqxrpqw7gmds9mvzdzac\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/2YPKiEBYCbRD38ruF/e8t7itu1w9r6vnvrwa5j 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/2YPKiEBYCbRD38ruF/zuupro0at0hxom8sci0n 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/2YPKiEBYCbRD38ruF/w8quviscgyeq0dqnszih 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/2YPKiEBYCbRD38ruF/ic1pv7ubu4r0s3e4o7oy 750w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/2YPKiEBYCbRD38ruF/vbauno0h7zw8zgzfcp2s 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/2YPKiEBYCbRD38ruF/wxrzvwz6kt4ret7gx086 1500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/2YPKiEBYCbRD38ruF/y8u6uzfjoeytkdsu0buw 2500w\"></p><p>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@inakihxz?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\">I\u00f1aki del Olmo</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/assorted-title-of-books-piled-in-the-shelves-NIJuEQw0RKg?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\">Unsplash</a></p><h2>Reasons not to do a PhD</h2><h3>Opportunity Cost</h3><p>PhDs typically take 3 to 5 years, depending on local academic practices. For example, PhDs in the EU take 3.5 to 4.5 years while in the US this can be considerably longer, often 5 years or more. Even within regions <a href=\"https://master-academia.com/average-years-phd-degree/#:~:text=Next%20to%20the,their%20doctoral%20studies!\"><u>the lengths of PhDs can also vary significantly</u></a>, with some students spending a year or two longer than they expected on their PhD.&nbsp;</p><p>This is a lot of time that could be spent pursuing other career paths. As a result, we do not recommend doing a PhD if you have no idea what to do (i.e. a \u201cpanic PhD\u201d is not a good idea!) \u2013 instead, taking some time out, working for a bit, and exploring your options could be better to figure out if research is something you actually want to do. Doing a research Master\u2019s is a lower opportunity cost for understanding if research is something you want to do.</p><h3>Low Pay</h3><p>PhDs are <a href=\"https://academiainsider.com/phd-student-salary-how-much-cash-will-you-get/#:~:text=Here%20is%20data%20for%20a%20range%20of%20countries%20ordered%20by%20the%20best%20living%20ratio%20the%20higher.%20The%20living%20to%20cost%20ratio%20the%20further%20the%20stipend%20goes.%20Data%20was%20collected%20from%20Glassdoor.com%20and%20Numeo.\"><u>typically paid much less</u></a> than jobs in industry and NGO sectors that require similar credentials. This constrains personal finances and limits the ability to effectively donate. This is negated somewhat by the expected increase in earnings after finishing the PhD, but some research demonstrates that PhDs can also find themselves <a href=\"https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/261317/1/GLO-DP-1126.pdf\"><u>overqualified relative to their wages</u></a>.</p><h3>Unnecessary for Career Path</h3><p>A PhD simply isn\u2019t required for many of the impactful engineering roles out there. Employers will only demand a PhD for work that is research related or very specific types of technical work. If you are doing operational work, or want to work at a large corporation, a PhD may scare away potential employers (as they need to pay you more!)</p><p>Depending on your personal background, similar skill and credential building could be done outside of academia. Many non-profits and <a href=\"https://www.politics.ox.ac.uk/news/who-should-work-think-tank-do-you-need-phd#:~:text=Do%20you%20need%20a%20PhD%20to%20work%20in%20a%20think,this%20topic%20as%20you%20do.\"><u>think tanks</u></a> no longer demand PhDs for research roles. PhDs can be a good signal for potential employers that you are able to produce high-quality research, but often a Masters is a more compact way of moving between specialisations or gaining academic credentials.</p><h3>Lack of Structure and Effect on Mental Health</h3><p>A PhD lifestyle can be a bad fit for those that struggle with self-motivation or require a lot of organisation and structure in their work. PhDs have come under scrutiny for their effect on mental health and high rates of <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-03761-3\"><u>anxiety and depression</u></a>.</p><h3>Non-linear Signalling Benefits over Time</h3><p>A lot of PhDs will feel under pressure to finish their PhD, as leaving early can be seen by themselves or others as a failure. While this is often overstated, the PhD is unusual in that a large chunk of the advantages in terms of perceived experience only comes at the end rather than continuously as you work. The size of this effect is difficult to find good data on. This is a disadvantage, as it creates a lot of inertia for those that should probably leave their PhDs sooner rather than later and lost perceived experience for those that do.</p><h3>Less Job Stability in Academia</h3><p>Compared to permanent contract roles, PhD funding is generally on a limited time scale, which results in less job stability and can have <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/26448777\"><u>various negative effects</u></a>. Post-docs often lament the limited opportunities and being forced to travel, although the pay improves significantly at this point. Those that take on teaching or research roles outside of academia generally have stable and well-paid work.</p><p><img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/2YPKiEBYCbRD38ruF/yzzj9ladjkujnw5wnm76\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/2YPKiEBYCbRD38ruF/quptdjcxeudhetswfhep 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/2YPKiEBYCbRD38ruF/ih0twwcz16jy0bvmk5jx 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/2YPKiEBYCbRD38ruF/omqcsytufgj1clza1ogd 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/2YPKiEBYCbRD38ruF/qxa6kelun0rz49sb68tw 750w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/2YPKiEBYCbRD38ruF/fiyofsjntl29l62xynca 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/2YPKiEBYCbRD38ruF/xmxcgbqb8itb1iqf08en 1500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/2YPKiEBYCbRD38ruF/nu5rnhngdklakn6sizpi 2500w\"></p><p>Photo by <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@albertvincentwu?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\">Albert Vincent Wu</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/people-standing-on-green-grass-field-during-daytime-epeyZPBDsCQ?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\">Unsplash</a></p><h2>Other factors</h2><p>There are also other personal factors that should influence your decision to take on a PhD:</p><h3>Is there another path available for me to do impactful work?</h3><p>It\u2019s always best to consider all options when making a large career decision like this. For many people that have recently finished a Bachelors or Master\u2019s degree or are working in a University, starting a PhD may seem like the most obvious and straightforward next step. It\u2019s important to think laterally and see what opportunities for impact are available to you. A role in industry, a non-profit organisation or the government, for example, could yield higher impact and may not carry the same downsides.</p><h3>Will the money offered by a PhD be enough to sustain you?</h3><p>If you have to support a family or if you have sizable debts, it might be best to hold off on a PhD until you are more financially secure. There are many paths to impact you can take that can be more lucrative in the short term and you can return to graduate school after if that turns out to be the best move for your career.</p><h3>Is there a good enough University, project and supervisor willing to take you on right now?</h3><p>It may be the case that you can\u2019t find a PhD that has a better path to impact than your current role or career path. Fortunately good PhD opportunities do appear, so playing the waiting game can pay off. In my own experience, often better research roles can be found through building a network in academia or just cold emailing relevant researchers expressing enthusiasm than on sites like <a href=\"https://www.findaphd.com/\"><u>findaphd.com</u></a>.</p><p>It\u2019s often said that a supervisor can make or break a PhD. A good supervisor will guide the student\u2019s research, facilitate their practical needs and help with their career post-PhD. A bad supervisor will impede the student with other duties and prioritise their research or career goals over their student\u2019s.</p><p>Two often underrated traits of a supervisor are their disposition and how busy they are. Even a very highly esteemed supervisor with access to lots of funding and equipment will be very difficult to work with if they are unpleasant to students and don\u2019t have enough time to discuss your project.</p><h3>Can you get into the right PhD with your background?</h3><p>If your academic or research credentials aren\u2019t well regarded by PhD supervisors, you may struggle to get into the right PhD to pursue your chosen path to impact. This would call for spending some time building other credentials. This isn\u2019t intended to dissuade those without an academic background though, as PhD programs are often easier to get into than those outside academia may suspect.</p><h3>Is entrepreneurship something you want to do, and will doing a PhD can set you up well for this path?</h3><p>A PhD often gives you extra credibility with potential investors, customers, and partners. The networking element when doing a PhD is important \u2013 it allows you to build up a network of people in a specific field that is evolving quickly. This allows you to level up faster than if you were working in industry. People are also more willing to be part of academic studies rather than pure market research for a potential product. Especially in English-speaking Western countries, a PhD allows you to get in contact with influential and interesting people (but this reason alone is probably not good enough to do a PhD!) If entrepreneurship is your end goal, you need to choose the right place and culture to do a PhD. It\u2019s best to find a project and research group that respects you and will position you well for impactful entrepreneurship.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Doing a PhD is probably the optimal path to impact for a minority of people. The low pay, lack of structured work and lost opportunities in the meantime are prohibitive for many people. For those that have chosen to pursue research, enjoy unstructured working environments and can stomach the financial situation, a PhD is an excellent way to build skills and credentials. Also for what it\u2019s worth a lot of people really enjoy their PhD, myself included!</p><p>For a more in-depth case study on one person\u2019s decision to pursue a PhD to maximise their impact, consider reading <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2013/10/why-i-m-doing-a-phd/\"><u>this article</u></a> by Jess Whittlestone.</p><p>If you\u2019d like to keep up with impactful engineering PhD opportunities, subscribe to <a href=\"https://www.highimpactengineers.org/newsletter\">our newsletter</a>!</p>", "user": {"username": "Hugh Irving"}}, {"_id": "ME4ihqRojjuhprejm", "title": "Effective Giving Incubation - apply to CE & GWWC\u2019s new program!", "postedAt": "2023-12-05T16:08:48.557Z", "htmlBody": "<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ME4ihqRojjuhprejm/zdjq9omtdqdlujz9vcxs\"></p><p><a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/\"><u>Charity Entrepreneurship</u></a> in collaboration with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\"><u>Giving What We Can</u></a> is opening a new program to launch 4-6 new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/effective-giving-incubation\"><u>Effective Giving Initiatives&nbsp;</u></a>(EGIs) in 2024.

In short, they have made real progress on many of the world\u2019s most pressing problems.</p><p><strong>However, there is still too little funding for highly impactful nonprofits</strong> and our internal&nbsp;<u>analysis</u> suggests that&nbsp;<strong>EGIs are a proven effective way to raise these funds</strong>. This lack of funding takes time away from people who could be working on important problems, who instead have to focus on fundraising.

One solution to this problem is to make them read it during the session itself.&nbsp;</p><p>Inspired by<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/foJhEZzG5sx9cQJZq/agisf-adaptation-for-in-person-groups\"><u> how some groups are running AGISF</u></a>, we made our EA intro sessions longer from 1-1.5 hours to 2 hours and readjusted the curriculum so that people can do the readings during the session - spending ~1 hour on silent reading, and ~1 hour on discussions, with ~20-minute intervals.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find our adjusted curriculum (with notes for reasoning transparency) <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ES2DnFdvyBAEhEjt9f38vYVrxa5dJa-RiUf8GLIJbzY/edit?usp=sharing\">here </a>and printing materials&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10aK34GfOVyFKYxvpCjUPJ0UVyFK6JyYF?usp=sharing\"><u>here</u></a>, but I really&nbsp;<strong>don\u2019t recommend just jumping ahead and changing your fellowship format to in-session readings</strong>. Apart from some of the obvious benefits, it has drawbacks as well, and after trying it a few times, I think&nbsp;<strong>I personally have a preference for at-home readings for EA fellowships</strong>, although, for our future fellowships, we will try to accommodate particularly busy people to take part in an in-session reading group.</p><p>Here I will outline the Pros and Cons of in-session reading fellowship compared to at-home readings as I see them. Please note that although we have run this format a few times, most of what I will write here is still speculation using common sense, as we just don\u2019t have enough data to draw strong conclusions. I will try to state my confidence in each of the claims.&nbsp;</p><p>I also expect there could be plenty of community builders who would draw different conclusions, so I encourage you to comment on this post!</p><h2>PROs</h2><h3>People don\u2019t have to prepare for a session</h3><p>The obvious advantage is people don\u2019t have to prepare for the session, and you don\u2019t have those awkward situations where one or more of the participants can\u2019t really contribute to the conversation.</p><h3>Slightly better attendance (maybe?)</h3><p>You could also speculate that this will mean that people are also more likely to show up, as they won\u2019t skip the session due to not having time to read the materials beforehand. Unfortunately, I don\u2019t have enough data to say anything confidently about this, but our subjective experience was that although this might help a bit, people will skip sessions for other reasons, so you shouldn't expect this to solve all problems relating to attendance.</p><h3>You can run intensive fellowships</h3><p>I have written about the pros and cons of intensive fellowships <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/editPost?postId=vGrHhFp4hyDtfsbvh&amp;key=d1cf1351f85b54cd9914a5afa4ac25\">here</a>. I think it might make sense to do a zero-homework version for the intensive week, but I\u2019m not fully sure. I recommend reading the linked post and making up your own mind!</p><h2>Cons</h2><h3>You get to cover way less materials&nbsp;</h3><p>The intro fellowship is a&nbsp;<strong>lot&nbsp;</strong>of reading, I think the required reading for the first 4 sessions is around 300 pages. If you do the readings in session, you will cover much less. I also think there is some additional value to people reading at home, as in that case, they can go on \u201cclicking journeys\u201d that lead from one article to the other. Of course, you could argue that they can do that anyway if they care enough.</p><h3>Printing is inconvenient</h3><p>We actually printed out some copies, it was expensive, heavy, and inconvenient, so I think it would have been better just to ask people to bring their laptops from the beginning. That said, there is still value to printing maybe 1-3 copies, so you can accommodate participants if they can\u2019t bring a laptop.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnyb2rgult9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnyb2rgult9\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;If you do print some copies, I would recommend&nbsp;<strong>not</strong> binding all the sheets into one big \u201cbook\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkm1vasmdego\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkm1vasmdego\">[2]</a></sup></span>, but putting the readings in a big ring binder<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffkqrrtucb4l\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfkqrrtucb4l\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and numbering them such as Week x reading y, etc., this way you can more easily swap readings as the intro curriculum evolves, as well as replace damaged sections.</p><h2>Feedback from participants and facilitators</h2><p>The feedback we got from participants was pretty mixed, we generally found that for groups who did the readings in-session wished that they could have more time for discussion and that they could do the readings at home. For groups that did at-home readings, people often weren\u2019t able to prepare and wished we had in-session readings. Oh well :)&nbsp;</p><p>My sense is that facilitators generally preferred the at-home reading version, as that way you don\u2019t have to worry that much about not being able to cover all the readings in time. They also told me that when the discussion is really good it\u2019s always a bit unfortunate to have to go back to readings - I guess balancing this can be tricky. If you would like to get a feel for it you can read our facilitator reflections of in-session reading groups&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V61SYbCB_Pt0Uzc9dOIjT7PFPTK59GC_kw1E5uLDVJs/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>here</u></a> (just note that some of them are AIS groups).</p><p>The only strong conclusion that I would draw is that&nbsp;<strong>if your group seems very motivated, consider asking them if they want to do at-home readings.</strong></p><h2>When should you use at-home vs. in-session readings?</h2><p>Regardless of whether it\u2019s an EA/AIS (or any other) course, here is a general rule of thumb I would recommend at the moment:</p><p>1. Generally go with in-session readings&nbsp;<strong>if the materials are technical, so people will understand them better if they get to talk them through right after reading</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Example 1</u>:</strong> Weekly AGISF course for people who are not familiar with AIS</p><p>2. Generally go with at-home readings, if&nbsp;<strong>the readings are accessible enough that people can recollect the main arguments pretty well.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong><u>Example 2</u>:</strong> Weekly intro to EA fellowship for people not familiar with EA</p><p>3. If the readings are difficult,&nbsp;<strong>but your group members are knowledgeable and motivated enough to be able to have a high-fidelity discussion about them</strong><i>,&nbsp;</i>then I think having at-home readings is preferable.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Example 3</u>:</strong> The most motivated participants after finishing AGISF come together to do the 201 Course. Everyone carefully reads the materials at home and writes down some of their confusions to discuss during the sessions.</p><p><strong><u>Example 4</u>:</strong> A group of people who regularly read LessWrong come together to do AGISF</p><p>4. If for whatever reason you can\u2019t expect your participants to do the readings at home, then consider using in-session readings.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Example 5</u>:</strong> You get to engage policymakers about existential risk and you want to be conscious of their time, so if you want them to read some materials, you do it during the session.</p><h2>Should you switch your intro to EA fellowship to in-session readings?</h2><p>My tentative conclusion is no but with some caveats. If you feel like your participants are really motivated to learn about EA, but just simply don\u2019t have the time, then I think it makes sense to accommodate them.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, if you feel like people don\u2019t care enough, to prepare (or even show up), then I think it might make sense to just disband a given discussion group.&nbsp;</p><p>Strictly speaking, this is not the topic of this post, but I thought this is worth mentioning that in the past I have often felt that I really have to make sure that each group finishes the program. And if people are not showing up, then I must be doing something wrong. After all, successful groups have a lot of people finishing the intro fellowship, right?&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, you should make sure that facilitators get proper training,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefz7o9g7fapwq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnz7o9g7fapwq\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;however, some fellowship groups never get off the ground, even if the facilitator is doing a reasonable job. In such cases, I think it is okay to ask the question of whether it\u2019s worth continuing the group, especially if the 1-2 most motivated participant(s) can join another group.&nbsp;</p><h2>Things we might try in the future:</h2><p>In the future, I want to test whether it would work to have in-session readings for the intro fellowships but have each attendee read a different text and summarise it for the group for discussion. This way you would get to cover more materials and maybe get people to pay closer attention while reading. I can think of several pitfalls of this approach too though, so I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s worth the time to modify the curriculum. We will see, I will write an update if we end up piloting this.</p><p>Another thing that would be nice to try is having a \u201chybrid\u201d version where participants are expected to do readings at home, but you also do some during the session. This way if someone doesn\u2019t have time to prepare, then they can still contribute to the discussions but you have the benefit of getting motivated people to read more.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Overall I\u2019m glad we ran this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/rsq98ZnMAjfrYFwtq\"><u>experiment</u></a> and learnt a lot from it, will might end up using a mixed version in the future, where particularly busy people are accommodated with in-session readings.

We investigated the effect size of psychotherapy on depression immediately after treatment. This is one of several components that will go into our impact analyses of mental health interventions in general, as well as our cost-effectiveness analysis of StrongMinds more specifically.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/sJKgLxipgXn7TwiF5/floors-and-ceilings-frameworks-and-feelings-sogive-s-impact#1_The_SD_year_framework__and_why_we_prefer_it_to_the_alternative\"><u>Previously</u></a>, we introduced the concept that the impact of psychotherapy on depression can be analysed in two parts: The first, quantifying the impact of psychotherapy on depression immediately after the administration of treatment, and the second, quantifying the long term effects of psychotherapy after treatment is over. This article quantifies the immediate impact of psychotherapy.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iJX6FmohigXtNWzAp/mivfqmqnxztc6bl7z0gy\"></p><p>We base our estimate on meta-analysis using the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.metapsy.org/\"><u>METAPSY dataset</u></a>, which is the largest database we could find on psychotherapy interventions on depression, and which comes built in with useful meta-analysis tools. Starting from an aggregated effect size of g = 0.73, after removing studies which did not pass four criteria assessing risk of bias factors in study design (g= 0.52),&nbsp; removing outliers (g = 0.49), and adjusting for publication bias (g=0.41),&nbsp;<strong>we found that the overall effect size of therapy is Hedge's g = 0.41, on a basis which excludes our final adjustments for the number of therapy sessions.&nbsp;</strong>Further restricting the analysis to low-income countries increases it to Hedge's g = 0.44; we chose not to focus on this number for the reasons set in the section on Extreme global poverty. We think these estimates reflect the current state of academic knowledge regarding the impact of psychotherapy, including those in low-income contexts which are similar to StrongMinds.&nbsp; We've reviewed some academic meta-analyses which come to different conclusions, and after accounting for differences in which populations they are analysing and which adjustments they choose to make, we can give an account of which methodological choices cause the difference.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iJX6FmohigXtNWzAp/qwq4ztqxzbr6ypk7zqxu\"></p><p><strong>Risk of bias factors</strong>: METAPSY has graded every paper in the dataset using Cochrane's Risk of Bias tool (version 1), which ascertains sources of bias stemming from study design. We restricted our analysis to studies which met all four out of four criteria.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Removing Outliers:&nbsp;</strong>METAPSY considers studies with a 95% confidence interval which lies outside the 95% confidence interval of the pooled effect as an outlier. We chose to remove outliers in order to keep heterogeneity (I<sup>2</sup>) low - publication bias correction techniques can give unusual results when heterogeneity is high.</p><p><strong>Publication bias:&nbsp;</strong>METAPSY offers several methods for correcting for publication bias. We went with Duval and Tweedie Trim and Fill.</p><p>We are highly uncertain regarding how much psychotherapy is required to achieve a given result. The average study in our analysis had 9 sessions, whereas the StrongMinds intervention has 6 sessions. The evidence suggests diminishing returns - that the first few sessions have more impact than later sessions. Using number of sessions as a predictor in a mixed-effects meta-regression on psychotherapy studies which ran between 3 and 12 sessions and pass all four Cochrane's&nbsp; risk of bias in study design&nbsp; (g=0.52) returned a slope of 0.036 and intercept of 0.26. We therefore estimated that&nbsp;<strong>shortening the number of sessions from 9 to 6 might theoretically adjust the effect size by a factor of by (0.52-0.036\u00d73)/0.52 = 79%, which would bring our final number to 0.41\u00d779%= 0.32</strong>, though we think anything from 66% to 90% could plausibly be justified.</p><p>We believe there is significant uncertainty about how to think about \"placebo effects\". Estimates of placebo effects in psychotherapy range from 0.04-0.21. We think that a genuine placebo effect, reflecting benefits stemming from the expectations of the patient, should \"count\" as impact, but there may be other sources of bias masquerading as placebo effects, and literature on the size of placebo effects both in mental health and in general is scarce. We also think that in the spirit of making equal comparisons, it's best to consider placebo effects separately, because whether one wishes to subtract placebo effects may change depending on whether one is comparing psychotherapy to a placebo controlled intervention (e.g. analyses regarding the effect of cash transfers aren't placebo controlled, whereas analyses regarding impacts of deworming pills draw from placebo controlled literature).</p><p>We will defer discussions of the duration of the effect, the cost of the program, household spillovers, and the interpretation of moral weights to be published in subsequent posts.</p><h2>Acknowledgements&nbsp;</h2><p>We'd like to thank Joel McGuire and HLI for their feedback and for laying the groundwork for EA research into mental health, Prof Cuijpers, and Gregory Lewis for their advice and criticism, and the builders of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.metapsy.org/team\"><u>metapsy project</u></a> designing the tools and databases that enable this analysis.

Our analysis of the effect size of therapy&nbsp; was made before we knew that GiveWell was also doing an assessment, so ours can be thought of as somewhat independent analyses.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref40ubpjqubou\"><sup><a href=\"#fn40ubpjqubou\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iJX6FmohigXtNWzAp/ysuguivmfhn8af64iodg\"></p><p><strong>Table:&nbsp;</strong>The EA forum was unfortunately not playing well with tables, so we took a screenshot.

They determined that discounting psychotherapy studies by 89% would put psychotherapy and cash on an even footing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Psychotherapy-CEA.pdf\"><u>McGuire, (2021a</u></a>).</p><p>In contrast, we use MetaPsy tools to eliminate studies with various risk of bias factors in order to estimate the absolute number, using only objective assessments. We think this is the biggest contributor to the differences between our assessment and HLIs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>SoGive favours broader evidence over more contextually specific evidence, when it comes to assessing the impact of therapy:&nbsp;</strong>The 0.80 figure which GiveWell took as a starting point from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/StrongMinds-CEA.pdf\"><u>McGuire, J. (2021b)</u></a>, table 1b p. 13, is drawn from studies with \"StrongMinds-Like-Traits\", which included variables to indicate that a study was primarily psychotherapy, delivered to groups, women, and by non-specialists. Additionally, HLI\u2019s analysis was restricted to low income countries, and evidence which most directly pertains to StrongMinds was weighted higher.&nbsp; Based on our review of literature, we think that without risk of bias correction,&nbsp; a lot of the variation in these datasets will be entirely due to bias arising from differences in study design.&nbsp; We also don't think there's sufficient evidence that these factors matter to justify filtering the dataset in this way. Therefore, our dataset includes all countries, all psychotherapy types, and all delivery modalities.</p><p><strong>SoGive's publication bias adjustment is similar to GiveWell's 75%, probably by coincidence:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/h5sJepiwGZLbK476N/assessment-of-happier-lives-institute-s-cost-effectiveness#Publication_bias\"><u>GiveWell's 75% publication bias</u></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>adjustment is based on a paper by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0137864\"><u>Driessen (2015)</u></a> which empirically determined the discount by identifying 20 published studies which got NIH grants, and then contacting grant awardees who did not publish to collect their manuscripts. Adding 6 unpublished studies made the effect size drop by 75%.&nbsp;</p><p>For SoGive,&nbsp;<i>post</i>-risk-of-bias correction at g = 0.52, the combination of correcting for outliers (to reduce heterogeneity) and correcting for publication bias brings us down to 0.41, which is a 78% adjustment.&nbsp;</p><p>However,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0137864\"><u>Driessen (2015)</u></a>'s dataset mixes placebo controlled trials and head-to-head antidepressant and therapy-vs-therapy comparisons in a way that make the characteristics of their dataset quite different from both METAPSY's and HLI's dataset, so we're not sure whether to consider this an independent convergence on the same conclusions or a coincidence.</p><p><strong>GiveWell gives a 75% discount for&nbsp; implementation at scale, whereas SoGive is optimistic about implementation at scale - our 79% discount is&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>specifically</strong></i><strong> about number of sessions:&nbsp;</strong>GiveWell has a general expectation that programs implemented as part of randomised trials are higher quality than similar programs implemented at scale outside of trial settings.</p><p>However, we found a conspicuous lack of evidence that things like \"type of therapy\" or \"therapist experience\" or \"therapist training\" matters, despite a fair amount of academic research on the topic. The&nbsp;<i>only</i> factor that we found reliably associated with therapy effectiveness is roughly whether the client likes the therapist. This is known as the \u201ctherapeutic alliance\u201d in the literature. Since we can't empirically support the hypothesis that some types of therapy are better than others, we don't think there's any particular reason to believe that therapy administered in RCTs is better than therapy administered by implementation organisations. The evidence that some implementations are particularly better than others in a systematic way is severely lacking.&nbsp; That's not to positively claim that there&nbsp;<i>aren't&nbsp;</i>differences in therapy quality - common sense suggests there must be some, but there is not much reason to think that academic studies are doing a better job of it.</p><p>One common-sense quality modifier is&nbsp; total therapy time. Based on a metaregression analysis, we did give StrongMinds a 79% discount from the average RCT, for having six sessions against the average RCT\u2019s nine. We didn't actually find strong support from the academic literature about the amount of therapy or number of sessions mattering (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://d1wqtxts1xzle7.cloudfront.net/32305317/2013_Cuijpers__meta_N_sessions__JAD-libre.pdf?1391528732=&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B+filename%3DHow_much_psychotherapy_is_needed_to_trea.pdf&amp;Expires=1699852512&amp;Signature=GKzhcudeH9YL1XdUJ~9OxNam97VGP3jBhEvwjMdZlWulBMEhxnCHVJUTI4ZOJ~3DO8zxC6qvQMUiDz5ZHEPpRMtzjjW~KbZGLl82NVRK9Kz5wv~jcHehQXJJDbGuzRvyQFsRnykMOASzjYNdOoK6PzNqyTctGBm4F4zWp4fPpV9mlVAa23yx-p7zGGT85JeYwDhvlCPGp4n90wzzKXrVyhApgX2uXWQfM-zXPfi6QDEZJ1lGCrxeYCysw8f18yWnW29~PoXxj6iDZGpjyF8YLxwdwWCnDUlC86legqcDKaT3pDiSgacHDnENIlcKw6h0K48fhY3fC9Qmfdg45xVYeA__&amp;Key-Pair-Id=APKAJLOHF5GGSLRBV4ZA\"><u>Cuijper, 2013</u></a> was unable to find a statistically significant effect) but the idea that number of sessions is irrelevant seemed too contrary to common sense not to discount it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>MetaPsy has more data:&nbsp;</strong>We think HLI's initial meta-analysis of indirect evidence is probably methodologically valid, but METAPSY brings much more data to the table: HLI \"extracted data from 39 studies that appeared to be delivered by non specialists and/or to groups\" (<a href=\"https://www.happierlivesinstitute.org/report/psychotherapy-cost-effectiveness-analysis/\"><u>McGuire, 2021a</u></a>) whereas the METAPSY database aggregates 520 studies containing 826 comparisons, with 196 comparisons making it to the final analysis after outliers and studies with risk of bias factors in study design were removed.</p><p><strong>SoGive is in agreement with HLI's overall framework for aggregating longitudinal impact across many patients</strong><i>:</i> As&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/sJKgLxipgXn7TwiF5/floors-and-ceilings-frameworks-and-feelings-sogive-s-impact#Aggregating_effect_sizes_across_multiple_studies_\"><u>previously discussed</u></a>, we generally agree with and plan to use HLI's overall methodology of integrating&nbsp; effect size with decay rate to find total effect, and think it's superior to methods like number needed to treat or comparing remission rates.</p><p><strong>SoGive doesn't correct for Social Desirability Bias:&nbsp;</strong>Because we started our analysis before seeing GiveWell's, social desirability bias wasn't on our radar and we have not devoted much time to it. The issue was first raised by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://strongminds.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/StrongMinds-Phase-Two-Impact-Evaluation-Report-July-2015-FINAL.pdf\"><u>StrongMinds Phase II impact evaluation</u></a> (P16) and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://strongminds.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/strongminds-phase-1-and-2-follow-up-evaluations_final.pdf\"><u>followup</u></a> (p2).&nbsp;</p><ul><li>We're not sure whether GiveWell's choice to add this discount stems from StrongMind's raising of the issue,&nbsp; but we think that while the authors of the StrongMinds Phase II trial settled on \"social desirability bias\" as an explanation for the unrealistically high results, there were likely several additional sources of bias that could explain it - including an absence of evaluator blinding, lack of intention to treat analysis, and inadequate randomization of study arms.</li><li>Our risk of bias in study design corrections rule out any RCTs without adequate blinding - which means the person or instrument evaluating the patient should not know whether the patient received therapy. This should rule out at least some of the common sense risk factors for social desirability bias.</li><li>Our short review of literature made us sceptical of social desirability bias inflating the results by 20%, and we're not sure there's any principled way to arrive at the 20% guess. However, we have not spent much time on this and may change our view in the future.&nbsp;</li><li>We do think that if social desirability bias&nbsp;<i>did</i> influence high quality RCTs, it might fall under \"apparent (false) placebo effects\", especially those involving sham therapy, since successfully placebo blinded participants should also be vulnerable to the bias. This means we might use placebo controlled data to place upper bounds on the effect.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>What would happen if GiveWell and SoGive's pessimistic adjustments were added together?:&nbsp;</strong>If an 80% social desirability bias adjustment was added to our results, it should lower effect size to .41*80%=.33. If an additional 75% adjustment was added for lower effectiveness at scale, it would become 0.41*80%*75%=0.25. After adjusting for lower session counts, this would become 0.25*75%=0.20</p><h2>Interpreting practical significance</h2><p>What is the practical significance of an effect size of around g=0.0.41, (or of 0.22, if placebo controlled)?&nbsp;</p><p>Traditionally, 0.2 is considered a \"small\" effect, 0.5 is considered a \"medium\" effect, and 0.8 is considered a \"large\" effect. Using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0019070\"><u>Furukawa (2011)</u></a>'s methodology as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/sJKgLxipgXn7TwiF5/floors-and-ceilings-frameworks-and-feelings-sogive-s-impact#Number_Needed_to_Treat__NNT_\"><u>explained previously</u></a>, an effect size of 0.41 for this dataset corresponds to a number needed to treat of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aM8ao9peYcnDwPn_yZeaUSrijqafLGRybS6zPm6rE-A/edit#gid=1507276746&amp;range=C16\"><u>8.3</u></a>, which means that for every person you treat, there is a 1\u00f78.3=12% chance that they become in full remission from depression due to your intervention and would not have remitted otherwise, ignoring sub-threshold improvements.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iJX6FmohigXtNWzAp/ekeck9iwczoq6qsxburs\"></p><p>From another angle, a model which runs simulated changes on real-world RCT trial data by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acps.13340\"><u>Hieronymus (2021)</u></a> suggests that if 20% of treated depressed patients were to magically be cured (no partial effects as you would see in the real world), with the remainder of patients showing only placebo effects, the effect size of that would be 0.22 against a pill-placebo (check out this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/all-medications-are-insignificant\"><u>blog post by AstralCodexTen</u></a> for an&nbsp; accessible review which also discusses effect sizes for other common treatments).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The scores of the average RCT participant from our METAPSY database who took the PHQ-9 had a standard deviation of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sNB40ot0sfa4v3OdF0Pv9F99hSKImbrjyTVfnISJeFU/edit#gid=2090836360&amp;range=B39\"><u>4.2</u></a>, which means that each point of improvement on the PHQ-9 would correspond to an effect size of 0.24. Accordingly,&nbsp; an effect size of 0.41 means that patients can attribute about 2 points of improvement on the PHQ-9 to psychotherapy.</p><p>In a subsequent article, we will expand more deeply on what a given effect size means for our moral intuitions, especially when combined with assessments for how long the effect lasts.&nbsp;</p><h2>Meta-Analysis - a more detailed overview</h2><p>We conducted our analysis using the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.metapsy.org/r-package\"><u>metapsy R package</u></a>, which among other things contains built-in functionality to correct for outliers, Cochrane's risk of bias, and publication bias.&nbsp;</p><p>Risk of Bias correction represents the most pessimistic adjustment on our analysis, reducing our effect size estimate from g = 0.72 (95% CI 0.66-0.78) to&nbsp; g = 0.53 (95% CI 0.46; 0.58), a 71% adjustment.

Although it is quite important for practical decision making in this area, we are currently relatively clueless about how many sessions are needed in psychotherapy, or what the dose-response curve of psychotherapy might look like.</p><h2>We generalise our findings to low income countries and non-western cultures&nbsp;</h2><p>When we began this analysis, one of our biggest uncertainties in evaluating the effectiveness of psychotherapy interventions from the global poor was how much to weigh data from everywhere vs data which specifically involved low income countries and the global poor. After doing the meta-analysis, we found that after risk of bias correction, restricting the sample to non-Western countries countries did not give meaningfully different answers relative to using data from all studies (though data that is restricted to non-Western countries remains meaningfully different from data restricted to Western countries even after all corrections).</p><p>In the beginning, there were hints that interventions aimed in less resource-rich contexts have better effects, and a reasonable narrative about how this might be because of greater struggle or less general exposure to and access to mental health assistance. We think this is why HLI used mostly data from low income countries to make their estimate.&nbsp;</p><p>MetaPsy's \"Country\" categorises group studies by whether they are in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia, the&nbsp; European Union, in East Asia, or in \"other\". All studies in \"other\" are \"non-Western\" countries, with a possible ambiguity exception in Israel. Other than Israel, some higher income non-Western countries (Turkey, Chile, Brazil, Colombia, South Africa) are part of the dataset, but the majority of the studies are done in low and middle income countries.&nbsp;</p><p>When we ran these countries through the same meta-analysis process that we used for all studies, we arrived at g=0.44 which was similar to what we got when we used all data (g =0.41).</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iJX6FmohigXtNWzAp/tpp6ncvjnlpmtitnswms\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iJX6FmohigXtNWzAp/jghmchtwphzwjrobsz6w\"></p><p>We considered using g = 0.44 instead of g = 0.41 for our headline estimate of StrongMinds, which takes place in a low-income country, except that in the case of this dataset,&nbsp;I<sup>2</sup> heterogeneity remained high, and our understanding is that publication bias correction becomes unreliable under such conditions. Therefore, we decided to stick with g = 0.41.</p><p>We still think that it's possible that treatments in non-Western countries are more effective than treatments in Western countries. When we restrict our meta-analysis to Western countries, we do get lower numbers (g=0.35) after publication bias correction and outlier removal.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iJX6FmohigXtNWzAp/jaab8yg8hkzskygfiubq\"></p><p>However, given the smaller number of studies passing all four risk of bias criteria in low income settings, and the heterogeneity issue described above, we still opted to use the pooled effect size of&nbsp; all studies rather than restricting the analysis to non-Western ones.</p><p><strong>Academic estimates of effects in low income and non-western countries:&nbsp;</strong>Why did we initially think that the effect size would be higher in non-western countries?&nbsp;</p><p>Most psychotherapies have been developed in high-income Western countries in places like North America, Europe and Australia, as have most RCTs regarding their effectiveness.

This means that some studies are considered outliers within certain datasets but not others. For instance, the RCT that StrongMinds is modelled from,&nbsp; <a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/articlepdf/196766/joc30288.pdf\"><u>Bolton 2003</u></a>, is considered an&nbsp; outlier relative to all studies.

The differences in the final numbers are due to a) restricting to Western samples b) restricting to non-waitlist controls.</p><p>An earlier paper,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK78732/\"><u>Cuijpers, A van Straten, et al (2010)</u></a> argued that poor study quality may be inflating effect size. After comparing&nbsp; 115 studies totalling 8140 participants with an effect size of d = 0.68 (95% CI 0.60\u20130.76), they graded the studies according to 8 markers of quality:&nbsp; 1) patients were evaluated by strict diagnostic criteria for depression 2) the therapy used a treatment manual 3) the therapists were trained 4) the therapists were supervised or recorded 5) the study used intention to treat analysis 6) the study involved more than 50 patients 7) Sequence generation randomisation of patients was accomplished via third party assessor or a computer 8) blinding of assessors&nbsp; Only 11 studies met these criteria, with an effect size of d=0.22 (95% CI 0.13\u20130.31). Criteria 4 through 8 were found to significantly reduce the effect size, and after a post-hoc relaxation of the criteria to include only those four, the number of qualifying studies increased to 20, with an effect size of d=0.34, 95% CI 0.20-0.48. While we think the authors are rightly concerned about the trend towards higher study quality leading to lower effect sizes, because of the small number of studies that met the stringent quality criteria, this estimate is noisy.</p><p><strong>Academic corrections of publication bias:&nbsp;</strong>In line with most meta-analyses,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/585841C1FAC63E0AAC140BA1557AEACA/S0007125000251805a.pdf/div-class-title-efficacy-of-cognitive-behavioural-therapy-and-other-psychological-treatments-for-adult-depression-meta-analytic-study-of-publication-bias-div.pdf\"><u>Cuijpers, Smit, et al (2010</u></a>) reported an effect size of&nbsp; d=0.67 (95% CI 0.60\u20130.76) when aggregating across 117 studies with 175 comparisons. However, this value fell to d=0.42 (95% CI 0.33\u20130.51) after adjusting for publication bias using Duval &amp; Tweedie\u2019s trim and fill procedure, with 51 comparisons excluded. These unadjusted and adjusted figures fell further to d= 0.51 and 0.39, respectively, after removing d&gt;1.5 outliers. These findings suggest that most meta-analyses are inflating the effect size of psychotherapy.&nbsp;</p><p>Following up,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0137864\"><u>Driessen (2015)</u></a> used NIH grants awarded from 1972\u20132008 to identify unpublished RCTs and requested the data from the authors. Whereas the 20 included published studies had an effect size of g = 0.52 (95% CI 0.37-0.68), including six additional unpublished studies (g = 0.20; 95% CI -0.11~0.51) resulted in a 25% reduction to the point estimate (g = 0.39), but with notably wide confidence intervals (95% CI 0.08-0.70).

We are therefore unsure whether&nbsp; the findings can generalise to our database of entirely therapy vs no-treatment trials.

His overall impression (personal communication) was that our estimate was more pessimistic than the ones in academic meta-analyses. He said that if he were doing the analysis, he would not have excluded outliers (which we found would make the estimate more optimistic, but ultimately would lead to a more pessimistic result due to causing a more severe trim-and-fill publication bias adjustments), and would have excluded studies using waitlist controls (which would make the estimate more pessimistic). If we would have followed this advice, we would have found that the aggregate effect size of all non-waitlist controlled studies which passed all four risk of bias criteria was g=0.48, which fell to 0.34 after trim-and-fill.&nbsp;</p><p>[Update: See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/wps.21069\"><u>Cuijpers 2023</u></a> for the latest comprehensive meta-analysis on the effect size of therapy by Prof Cuijpers.]</p><p><strong>Why we excluded outliers:&nbsp; </strong>MetapsyTools considers an effect size an outlier when it falls outside of the 95% confidence interval of the aggregated effect size. Excluding outliers involves repeatedly excluding and recalculating the aggregate effect size until no outliers remain. It's controversial to remove outliers in this way, without knowing the reason for the outlying result. We think this is a valid concern, but decided to remove outliers anyway primarily because failure to do so caused the publication bias correction tools to return implausible results, which we think is due to the outliers increasing heterogeneity.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why we included waitlist controls:&nbsp;</strong>A waitlist-controlled trial is one in which the control group is promised care at a later date. Including waitlist controls is controversial because some consider them to create a \"negative placebo effect\", as patients may become frustrated with waiting, or may procrastinate seeking alternative forms of care. We decided to include waitlist controls anyway because our analysis suggested the real reason that waitlist controls have higher effect sizes is because the alternative, \"care-as-usual\" samples, tend to take place in clinical contexts where patients are receiving non-psychotherapy forms of care from medical staff which may nonetheless be therapeutic, and excluding clinical samples removes the disparity. We also don't think individuals in a low-income context are likely to get alternate forms of care or be inpatients at a clinic.</p><p>We also asked Dr.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/gregory-lewis\"><u>Gregory Lewis</u></a>, who has been engaging with HLI's work on the EA forum to look over a draft of this document. He concurred with Prof. Cuijpers about excluding waitlist controls. He also suggested that maybe instead of doing a meta-analysis about the effect of psychotherapy, it would make more sense to go off of the direct evidence of the upcoming StrongMinds RCT, and that if the StrongMinds RCT didn't give a positive result, and if the internal evidence from StrongMinds and the evidence from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/articlepdf/196766/joc30288.pdf\"><u>Bolton 2003</u></a> (an RCT after which STrongMinds is modelled) was \"too good to be true\", we might stop the analysis and rule out this intervention.</p><p>In a somewhat related vein, when HLI estimated the impact of psychotherapy, they (optimistically, in our view) put more weight on direct evidence such as StrongMinds internal data and data from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/articlepdf/196766/joc30288.pdf\"><u>Bolton 2003</u></a>, and from studies with \"StrongMinds-like-traits\" than they did on the general psychotherapy literature, whereas we haven't explicitly given any additional weight to direct evidence in this analysis.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why we don't rely on more \"direct evidence\":&nbsp;</strong>We're sceptical of putting too much weight on a single RCT, whether positive or negative, even where it constitutes direct evidence.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iJX6FmohigXtNWzAp/tez4klbpumcwct09q8f5\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iJX6FmohigXtNWzAp/bqdul945sc5i7jaecnnh\"></p><p>The figure above includes all effect sizes included in the meta-analysis, arranged by Hedge's g and standard error. On the left, they are colour-coded by trial context. On the right, they are colour-coded by study design factors. The range of effect sizes is implausibly wide, from negative 0.55 to positive 9.56. It seems a bit implausible that most of this variation reflects true underlying differences in the particular interventions that occurred, even after accounting for things like risk of bias, country, populations, or control group.</p><p>&nbsp;We're not sure what generates such wide variation, but seen from this perspective, we get the sense that a single study is incredibly noisy data.

We're not as experienced at grading papers on Risk of Bias criteria, but as far as we can tell the internal StrongMinds&nbsp;<a href=\"https://strongminds.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/StrongMinds-Impact-Evaluation-Report-November-2014.pdf\"><u>phase 1</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://strongminds.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/StrongMinds-Phase-Two-Impact-Evaluation-Report-July-2015-FINAL.pdf\"><u>phase 2</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://strongminds.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/strongminds-phase-1-and-2-follow-up-evaluations_final.pdf\"><u>followup</u></a> evaluations do not pass any of the risk of bias criteria (they explicitly don't do intention to treat analysis, and implicitly don't mention anything that would allow us to confirm that they pass the other criteria), for a total score of 0/4. We aren't basing our estimate off of these more direct pieces of evidence, so this doesn't impact the headline findings of this document. We will publish a separate document evaluating more direct sources of evidence for StrongMinds in more detail.</p><p><strong>We think that it's reasonable to restrict ourselves to studies that meet all four risk of bias criteria</strong>. With respect to the first three criteria, proper randomization and blinding of participant and assessor seem uncontroversially necessary. We were initially most uncertain about intention to treat, but decided that it was also necessary.</p><p><strong>Does intention to treat analysis skew towards pessimism? (likely no):&nbsp;</strong>Intention to Treat Analysis&nbsp; (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5654877/#:~:text=Intention%2Dto%2Dtreat%20analysis%20is,(if%20any)%20they%20received\"><u>McCoy, 2017</u></a>) is when subjects in the treatment group are counted regardless of whether they actually received the treatment, as opposed to a \"per-protocol analysis\" where only treated subjects are compared to controls and the data from subjects who did not actually do the intervention is removed. The purpose of Intention To Treat Analysis is to avoid the problem where dropouts systematically differ from people who continue on with treatment, typically in ways that correlate with worse outcomes. Since the control group does not similarly \"drop out\", this ruins the randomization element of a controlled trial and artificially inflates effect sizes.&nbsp;</p><p>We were initially worried that because StrongMinds reports cost per person&nbsp;<i>treated</i> (rather than cost per person who signs up for treatment), that this would artificially deflate effect sizes, especially where dropout is high. In Intention to Treat analysis, where patients drop out and it is&nbsp; impossible to get post-treatment data from them, their pretreatment data is used as post-treatment data. We worried that this would create extra-conservative assumptions where not only would the treatment have had no effect, but that any spontaneous improvement would not have shown up in the dataset, which would cause them to be modelled as doing&nbsp;<i>worse</i> than the control group. However, we don't have evidence for this worry, and seeing the lower effect sizes in placebo-controlled trials (which may offer a more like-to-like comparison on dropout rates between treatment and control) and thinking in more detail about factors that could lead to potential inflation in apparent placebo lead us to believe that the pessimism of intention to treat analysis is mostly justified. (This is discussed in more detail in the section on placebo effects). Either way, the alternative - per-protocol-analysis skews very optimistic, which isn't acceptable.</p><h2>Methodologies for estimating publication bias and small study effects</h2><p>The MetaPsy package presents<a href=\"https://tools.metapsy.org/articles/web/get-started#publication-bias\"><u> three different options&nbsp;</u></a>for publication bias correction&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Duval and Tweedle trim and fill</strong>: this is the most widely used method, which detects funnel plot asymmetry, and then imputes in the data that it predicts would have been published without publication bias to calculate what the effect size would have been.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Limit meta-analysis:&nbsp;This method accounts only for small study effects, not publication bias per se</strong></li><li><strong>Step function selection model:&nbsp;Operates on the assumption that studies with p&lt;-.1 are more likely to get published</strong></li></ul><p>None of these methods provide valid results when between-study heterogeneity is high, but eliminating outliers to reduce the heterogeneity can be a practical workaround.&nbsp; (<a href=\"https://bookdown.org/MathiasHarrer/Doing_Meta_Analysis_in_R/pub-bias.html#pub-bias-which-method\"><u>Harrer, 2021)</u></a></p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iJX6FmohigXtNWzAp/pcpcchuzzu2in1tm5ig0\"></p><p><i>Figure: A funnel plot of all studies generated by MetaPsy.

For example, studies on inpatient settings find effect sizes of g = 0.29 (95% CI 0.13 - 0.44), and studies of primary care patients find effect sizes of g=0.31 (95% CI&nbsp; 0.17 - 0.45), and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.metapsy.org/uploads/summary_metapsy.pdf\"><u>Cuijpers (2017, page 11)</u></a> speculates that this is because in this context,&nbsp; \"usual care\u2026typically involves quite intensive care in inpatient settings, including psychological support and therapy\".&nbsp;</p><p>We think that this explanation is likely true, because when we exclude clinical samples, restricting waiting list controls or using only care as usual control groups stops looking pessimistic.<br>&nbsp;<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iJX6FmohigXtNWzAp/ptvoopr1gjf1y7s9ir8c\"><br>In other words, it is mostly clinical populations that show more pessimistic effect sizes when waitlists are excluded or the sample is restricted to care as usual.

Studies generally account for this by giving control groups a placebo, in an attempt to hide from subjects whether or not they have received a real treatment. However, not all improvement which occurs in a placebo controlled trial should be considered a placebo effect.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iJX6FmohigXtNWzAp/a6dvcqw3zickmmvaapac\"></p><p><i>Figure: Dumbo the elephant holds a \"magic\" feather, which the crows have claimed will allow him to fly.

One might imagine that an intervention aimed at reducing mortality needs no placebo controls, but apparent \"placebo effects\" can have striking and large effects on mortality - see review by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2988138/#:~:text=A%20meta%2Danalysis%20of%20eight,%25%20CI%200.42%E2%80%930.74).\"><u>Wilson (2010)</u></a>. Therefore, the question of when accounting for placebo effects is appropriate may need to be made somewhat on a case by case basis, to ensure like-to-like comparisons.</p><h2>Social desirability bias</h2><p>We were not initially planning on including social desirability bias in our assessment, but after seeing that GiveWell included an adjustment on it, we did a very brief overview of the literature in order to form a view on it.</p><p>Social desirability bias traditionally refers to the phenomenon where a research participant changes their self report based on which response might be viewed more favourably by others.&nbsp;</p><p>In GiveWell's adjustment, there were some more specific concerns raised about participant conflict of interest raised under this heading&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/h5sJepiwGZLbK476N/assessment-of-happier-lives-institute-s-cost-effectiveness#fn-AEsP2mm8QjfePzYi6-52\"><u>in footnote 52</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><ol><li>One concern was that the participant may inflate their self-reported subjective well being after the trial in order to reward the therapist who has put effort into helping them. We think that this is partially but not completely addressed by blinding assessors - if the assessor does not know whether the participant got the treatment, or if the assessor is a machine, there is less social pressure on the participant to act like they have been helped. Blinding assessors is one of the four items included in MetaPsy's Cochrane's risk of bias assessment, so we consider this concern partially but not wholly accounted for.&nbsp;</li><li>Another concern was that participants would inflate well being in order to prove treatments effective, if they believe in the treatment and are told that the control group will only receive the treatment if it proves effective. We don't think it's typical for participants to be told this, but to the extent that this is a problem, it's possible that active placebo may control for this, to the extent that participants are tricked by placebo and wish to reward it or prove it as correct. But the sparseness of placebo data and the difficulty of untangling genuine placebo-effects (which reflect genuine improvement due to therapy and so might morally \"count\") from pseudo placebo effects such as this, make it difficult to know for sure. We don't consider this concern accounted for.</li><li>A third concern was that the participant may inflate their self-reported depression before the trial in order to be included and receive treatment. We think that If participants are adequately blinded, in theory this should influence both intervention and control equally at baseline, and post-intervention this conflict of interest should disappear, and so both the intervention and the control group should be equally inflated. Adequate blinding is one of the four items included in Cochrane's risk of bias tool, used by the MetaPsy database, so we consider this concern fully accounted for in our analysis.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>We did a very quick, non-systematic skim of the literature on social desirability bias.

All therapy modalities seem to be somewhat equivalent, with the caveat that therapy which uses apps and books may be more effective if there is a person there to guide and occasionally check in with the client to provide support and accountability.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, it's possible that some of these do matter, but that the existing research hasn't been high powered or sophisticated enough to measure it. For instance, we weren't even able to find strong evidence from the existing literature that the number of therapy sessions or amount of time spent in therapy matters - even though common sense suggests that this obviously has to matter. A meta-analysis by<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10503307.2017.1395922?needAccess=true&amp;role=button\"><u>Cuijpers, Cristea (2019)</u></a> of studies which attempted to break down therapies into component parts suggests that \"The currently available component studies do not have the statistical power nor the quality to draw any meaningful conclusion about key ingredients of psychotherapies for adult depression\".</p><p>&nbsp;The factor for which the most convincing evidence has been collected seems to be that the client likes the therapist. Due to the finding that most types of therapies have comparable effects, attempts have been made to figure out which factors common to all therapies are important. Though various frameworks have been made, according to a review by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-clinpsy-050718-095424\"><u>Cuijpers, Reijnders (2019)</u></a>, \"no common or specific factor \u2026 can be considered an empirically validated working mechanism\". However, \"of all the common factors that have been proposed, the therapeutic alliance or therapeutic relationship is championed by many as the most important\". The term \"therapeutic alliance\" means, roughly, \"does the patient like the therapist\". A meta-analysis by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/157613/1/document%283%29.pdf\"><u>Fl\u00fcckiger (2018)</u></a> found that the therapeutic alliance correlates with good outcomes at r = 0.278 (95% CI 0.256 - .299) for face to face therapy and r = .275 (95% CI 0.205 - 0.344) for internet-based teletherapy.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Our takeaway is that the beneficial effects of therapy probably derive from the client going through some sort of systematic process to feel better, whether that be talking to someone who they like regularly, working through a therapy book with occasional check-ins, or attending a large group meeting, and that not much else about what works is known behind that.&nbsp;</p><p>In excluding these factors, we diverge from HLI's analysis, which considered therapies with \"Strong Minds-like-traits\"- interpersonal group psychotherapy studies involving a higher percentage of women, administered by lay counsellors rather than trained psychotherapists- to hold higher weight. This decision might have made HLI's analysis more optimistic, because these studies had higher effect sizes, which we suspect is probably due to risk of bias factors in study design rather than a true effect.&nbsp;</p><p>GiveWell gave StrongMinds analysis a pessimistic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/strongminds-happier-lives-institute#Effects_at_scale_and_outside_of_trial_contexts\"><u>75% adjustment</u></a> in anticipation of lower implementation quality outside of trial contexts. We agree with some aspects of this logic - we did give a 79% adjustment for lower session number - but given the conspicuous absence of evidence for any benefits on therapist training, experience, or any specific technique over any other, we suspect that considerations such as how exactly the lay counsellors are trained aren't too important.</p><h2>Meta-regression of therapy type, modality, gender produced no significant results</h2><p>After filtering for passing 4/4 criteria for risk of bias in study design, we did a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aM8ao9peYcnDwPn_yZeaUSrijqafLGRybS6zPm6rE-A/edit#gid=1527821525&amp;range=A60\"><u>meta-regression&nbsp;</u></a>comparing all therapy types, modalities, and gender and found that only one result - using \"life review therapy\" reached significance (P&gt;0.05).

Some modalities are dramatically cheaper than others, so it's helpful to know how well each modality works.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We don't think therapist training or experience matters much</strong>: Experienced therapists do not appear to be better than inexperienced therapists. The most recent paper on therapist experience,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/cpp.473\"><u>Leon (2005)</u></a>, finds that therapist prior experience may help when their patients are clinically and demographically very similar and not spaced too far apart, but this is an exception to the general trend in the literature. An excerpt from the review:&nbsp;</p><p>\"As part of the classic meta-analysis by Smith and Glass (1977) demonstrating the overall effectiveness of psychotherapy, these researchers examined whether years of experience as a therapist correlated with outcome. The authors found that years of experience correlated -0.01 with effect size (Smith &amp; Glass, 1977). In their 1980 meta-analysis of 485 studies, the correlation was again zero (Smith, Glass, &amp; Miller, 1980). Shapiro and Shapiro (1982) conducted another meta-analysis in response to the criticisms made of the meta-analyses of Smith et al. Sample therapists had an average of three years of experience. Despite improvements in their meta-analysis, these researchers again failed to find a correlation between years of experience and effect size. After multiple studies suggesting that experience plays a minimal to non-existent role in psychotherapy outcome and the inability to effectively criticize this literature (Nietzel &amp; Fisher, 1981), therapist experience as a research topic has waned in popularity. Some recent evidence suggests that experience effects can be found under more controlled treatment conditions that use treatment manuals and homogenous patient samples (e.g. Blatt, Sanislow, Zuroff, &amp; Pilkonis, 1996; Hupert et al., 2001). However, the majority of the extant literature still points to a null effect for experience\"</p><p>We think that the fact that neither a therapist's level of experience nor the school of therapy that they apply seem to influence patient outcomes in easily measurable ways is optimistic news for the viability of using trained laypersons, peers, and volunteers to deliver psychotherapy of similar quality.</p><p>A meta analysis by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8319860/\"><u>Connolly (2021)</u></a> found an effect size of g = 0.616 (95% CI 0.366 - 0.866) for therapy using lay counsellors. A meta analysis by<a href=\"https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapsychiatry/fullarticle/2790553\"><u> Karyotaki (2022)</u></a>, which used some but not all of the same studies, found an effect size of g = 0.48; 95% CI, 0.26-0.68; P\u2009&lt;\u2009.001), which fell to g= 0.32 (95% CI&nbsp; 0.26 to 0.38) when they did an individual patient data meta-analysis (which extracts raw patient data rather than summarising effect sizes, and is therefore higher quality). Both meta-analyses reported low risk of bias and no evidence of publication bias.</p><p><strong>Group Therapy is probably comparable to individual therapy</strong>: The MetaPsy database reports higher effect sizes for group therapy over individual therapy, though we are hesitant to draw conclusions from this as our meta regression did not show a significant difference.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\">METAPSY<br>Therapy Modality</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\">Uncorrected</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\">No outliers&nbsp;</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\">3+ risk of bias criteria met</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\">3+ criteria;

The Dodo Bird Verdict is the hypothesis that most forms of psychotherapy are equally effective. The hypothesis takes its name from the Dodo bird in Alice in Wonderland, who oversees a competition with no consistent rules and announces that \"Everybody has won, and all must have prizes\". This hypothesis has been hotly debated since the 1980s (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118625392.wbecp053#:~:text=Abstract,same%20goal%20of%20human%20change\"><u>Elliott, 2015</u></a>) and remains contentious.&nbsp;</p><p>A recent meta-analysis by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34002502/\"><u>Cuijpers, Quero (2021)</u></a>&nbsp; found that \"standardised mean differences compared with care-as-usual ranged from -0.81 for life-review therapy to -0.32 for non-directive supportive counselling.

The disease is estimated to cause up to 60,000 deaths per year and is 100% fatal if untreated.&nbsp;</p><p>While effective rabies treatment is available in many countries, the WHO, FAO and other organizations have emphasized prevention through dog vaccination as a particularly promising way to alleviate the burden of disease from rabies. While a lot of dog vaccination campaigns rely on parenteral vaccination, oral rabies vaccination is particularly well-suited to target dogs that are difficult to approach as they are delivered as baits for dogs to eat.</p><p>The evidence base for this intervention turns out to be quite weak. While there are several studies which look at oral vaccinations campaigns\u2019 effectiveness in terms of vaccinating a large proportion of a region\u2019s dog population, there is no evidence on the link between rabies vaccines and reduction in human rabies cases and deaths, and only weak evidence on the reduction on dog rabies incidence and human dog-bite incidence.&nbsp;</p><p>Experts took a negative view of a new organization working on direct delivery since rabies control campaigns are only permanently effective as an (inter-)national effort with substantial follow-up surveillance activity.</p><p>The cost-effectiveness analysis of a hypothetical five-year intervention in India results in an estimated $54,268 per averted DALY. Even under the most optimistic assumptions, the intervention would not be cost-effective, nor have a large impact in terms of lives saved.</p><p>Overall, my view is that oral rabies vaccination for dogs is not a recommendable intervention.</p><h1>1 &nbsp; Background</h1><h2>1.1 &nbsp; Rabies transmission and symptoms</h2><p><strong>Rabies is a viral infectious disease transmitted through direct contact</strong> (i.e., through broken skin, or eye, nose and mouth mucosa) with saliva from an infected animal. Usually, people get rabies from a bite from a rabid animal, and in rare cases from non-bite injuries such as scratches. Other kinds of contact, such as petting a rabid animal or contact with blood, urine or feces, does not lead to rabies transmission (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/transmission/index.html#:~:text=Rabies%20virus%20is%20transmitted%20through,bite%20of%20a%20rabid%20animal.\"><u>CDC, 2019</u></a>). Nowadays, around&nbsp;<strong>99% of global human rabies cases are transmitted by dogs</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies\"><u>WHO, 2023</u></a>), a large proportion of these dogs being free-roaming (<a href=\"https://rr-asia.woah.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/kinzang-dukpa_woah-orv-activities.pdf\"><u>WOAH, 2022</u></a>).</p><p>When an animal or human is bitten by a rabid animal, the infected saliva enters the wound and travels through the nerves to the spinal cord and brain. This incubation period can last between several weeks to months. During this time, the infected animal or person shows no symptoms and cannot transmit the virus to others. Once the virus reaches the brain, it multiplies and passes to the salivary glands. This is when the human or animal starts to show symptoms, which come in two forms: furious rabies (including symptoms such as hyperactivity, aggression and hallucinations) and paralytic rabies (including symptoms such as paralysis and coma) (<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies\"><u>WHO, 2023</u></a>).&nbsp;<strong>Once symptoms appear, treatment is no longer possible</strong>, and the human or animal dies within about a week (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/transmission/body.html\"><u>CDC, 2017</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><h2>1.2 &nbsp; Global burden of disease</h2><p>The exact burden of disease from rabies is unclear, since different sources provide different numbers and estimates.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthdata.org/results/gbd_summaries/2019/rabies-level-3-cause\"><u>IHME (2019)</u></a> reports 13,700 deaths (95% CI 6,020\u201317,900) and 782,000 (320,000\u20131,080,000) DALYs for the year 2019. In contrast,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003709\"><u>Hampson et al. (2015)</u></a> report 59,000 deaths (95% CI 25,000\u2013159,000) and 3,700,000 (1,600,000\u201310,400,000) DALYs. Some older studies also report numbers between 50,000\u201360,000 human rabies deaths per year (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10194833/\"><u>Haupt et al., 1999</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.scielosp.org/pdf/bwho/2005.v83n5/360-368\"><u>Knobel et al., 2005</u></a>).</p><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/number-of-deaths-from-rabies-by-world-region\"><u>Our World in Data (2019)</u></a> (which uses the data from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthdata.org/results/gbd_summaries/2019/rabies-level-3-cause\"><u>IHME (2019)</u></a>), around&nbsp;<strong>46% of rabies deaths occur in Asia and around 33% in Africa</strong>. This means the majority of the disease burden is located in LMICs<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefykrd2cvtce9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnykrd2cvtce9\">[1]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;</p><h2>1.3 &nbsp; Rabies treatment</h2><p>Rabies has a&nbsp;<strong>fatality rate of 100% if untreated</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies\"><u>WHO, 2023</u></a>). However,&nbsp;<strong>treatment in the form of post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) is 100% effective</strong> if properly administered. It consists of a dose of human rabies immune globulin (HRIG) and a course of several rabies vaccines. People who have been previously vaccinated or have received pre-exposure vaccination usually do not receive HRIG (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/medical_care/index.html#:~:text=Postexposure%20prophylaxis%20(PEP)%20consists%20of,3%2C%207%2C%20and%2014.\"><u>CDC, 2022</u></a>). The average cost of PEP is around $108 and can be as high as almost $600 (<a href=\"https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/272756/9789241513838-eng.pdf?sequence=1\"><u>FAO et al., 2018</u></a>). This excludes patients\u2019 costs for lost income and travel to health clinics, which can be considerable given that 80% of rabies cases occur in rural areas (<a href=\"https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/272756/9789241513838-eng.pdf?sequence=1\"><u>FAO et al., 2018</u></a>). Combined with the fact that most rabies deaths happen in Asia and Africa, it can be assumed that treatment is often inaccessible for the people who need it most.</p><h2>1.4 &nbsp; Rabies prevention</h2><p>As stated above, virtually all global human rabies cases are transmitted by dogs (<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies\"><u>WHO, 2023</u></a>). One way to reduce the global burden of disease is lowering the cost of and increasing access to PEP (<a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/inside-global-campaign-get-rid-rabies\"><u>Stokstad, 2017</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies\"><u>WHO, 2023</u></a>). However, a more cost-effective and better long-term solution to fighting dog-mediated rabies could be tackling the problem at the source, which means&nbsp;<strong>reducing rabies incidences in dogs directly via dog vaccination</strong> (<a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2017.00038/full\"><u>Mindekem et al., 2017</u></a>).</p><p>Since rabies is an infectious disease, the virus needs to be properly controlled in order to prevent outbreaks. The&nbsp;<strong>WHO recommends vaccinating at least 70% of the dog population in order to manage canine rabies</strong> and keep infections at bay (<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/26-10-2023-new-recommendations-for-oral-vaccination-of-dogs-against-rabies\"><u>WHO, 2023</u></a>). In the best case, high dog vaccination rates could altogether eliminate rabies in certain regions. This has been shown by the Gates Foundation (<a href=\"https://www.who.int/teams/control-of-neglected-tropical-diseases/rabies/control-and-elimination-strategies/proof-of-concept\"><u>WHO, n.d.</u></a>) as well as by the fact that rabies has been widely eliminated in Europe and the Americas (see for example&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2414-6366/5/1/47\"><u>Gibson et al., 2020</u></a>)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqsvh0bcqldi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqsvh0bcqldi\">[2]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;</p><p>Traditionally, dogs are vaccinated using parenteral (i.e., injectable) vaccines, which are cheap and easy to administer, particularly to homestead dogs (<a href=\"https://www.who.int/teams/control-of-neglected-tropical-diseases/rabies/vaccinations-and-immunization/veterinary-vaccines\"><u>WHO, n.d.</u></a>). However, reaching a 70% vaccination coverage is not always feasible only using parenteral vaccines, since many stray and free-roaming dogs are difficult to capture and restrain in order to inject them. In addition, dog-catching teams need to receive extensive training, and capturing free-roaming dogs is time-intense as well as dangerous (<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/14/1/155\"><u>Yale et al., 2022</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33805404/#:~:text=As%20not%20all%20dogs%20were,vaccinated%20by%20the%20oral%20route.\"><u>Chanachai et al., 2021</u></a>). This means that a significant portion of free-roaming dogs remains unvaccinated and potentially rabid.</p><h2>1.5 &nbsp; Oral rabies vaccination</h2><p>Oral rabies vaccines (ORV) could help close the vaccination gap, since they are better-suited to target stray and free-roaming dogs (<a href=\"https://rr-asia.woah.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/kinzang-dukpa_woah-orv-activities.pdf\"><u>WOAH, 2022</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771423000824\"><u>Freuling et al., 2023</u></a>). Instead of injecting the vaccine,&nbsp;<strong>oral vaccines can be administered without touching or coming too close to a dog</strong>. ORVs usually come in liquid form, contained in a plastic sachet and inside a bait, which the dog will eat. When chewing the bait, the dog perforates the sachet and the vaccine is released into the dog\u2019s mouth, where it is taken up by the palatine tonsils (<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/14/1/155\"><u>Yale et al., 2022</u></a>).</p><p><img style=\"width:58.52%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/euGHRkerLHQqeKSER/o6acqvytmlb2dxqch5sw\">&nbsp;</p><p><i>Figure 1: ORV bait (</i><a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/14/1/155\"><i><u>Yale et al., 2022</u></i></a><i>)</i></p><p>The baits come in different variations and can be produced locally (e.g., meatballs, boiled intestines) or manufactured on an industrial level (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://idt-biologika.de/\"><u>IDT Biologika</u></a>\u2019s egg bait). While different baits appeal to different dog species in different geographies, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/373617/9789240082731-eng.pdf?sequence=1.\"><u>WHO (2023)</u></a> and others (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33805404/#:~:text=As%20not%20all%20dogs%20were,vaccinated%20by%20the%20oral%20route.\"><u>Chanachai et al., 2021</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771423000824\"><u>Freuling et al., 2023</u></a>) recommend using industrially manufactured baits. Oral vaccines require a stable cold chain at freezing temperatures to keep their potency (<a href=\"https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/373617/9789240082731-eng.pdf?sequence=1.\"><u>WHO, 2023</u></a>), so interrupting the cold chain to put vaccine sachets inside pieces of meat or intestines during local manufacturing (after which the baits need to be re-frozen until they are used) can reduce the vaccine\u2019s effectiveness. When using an industrially manufactured bait (i.e., when buying the vaccine, the sachet is already inside a bait), the vaccine sachets do not need to be taken out of freezers in order to put them inside baits.</p><p>ORVs can be distributed amongst dogs in different ways (<a href=\"https://veterinaryresearch.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13567-018-0554-6\"><u>Cliquet et al., 2018</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/373617/9789240082731-eng.pdf?sequence=1.\"><u>WHO, 2023</u></a>):</p><ul><li><strong>Door-to-door model</strong>: vaccination teams visit individual homes and either administer ORVs to the dog directly, or hand over the bait to the dog\u2019s owner to administer later. This method only targets owned dogs and requires dog owners to handle the ORV, potentially interrupting the cool chain if the dog is not at home and the bait only offered at a later time. This method can also be very time consuming.</li><li><strong>Wildlife model</strong>: baits are placed at selected sites where they are accessible to free-roaming dogs. After 18\u201324h, baits that have not been eaten are recollected. This method is well-suited for reaching dogs that avoid human contact; however, it bears a greater risk of humans and non-target animals coming into contact with the bait. Since dog rabies vaccines are often live virus vaccines, they bear the risk of infection or mutation.</li><li><strong>Hand-out and retrieve model</strong>: vaccination teams distribute baits to each dog they encounter while moving through an area. If a dog does not accept the bait, it is recollected to avoid bringing it into contact with humans or non-target animals. This method is well-suited to target free-roaming owned and ownerless dogs, but not homestead dogs.</li></ul><p>Previous mass vaccination campaigns have shown that ORV can be effective in helping to reduce and even eliminate rabies transmitted by certain animal species in certain regions, such as fox-mediated rabies in vast areas of Western and Central Europe (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3720040/\"><u>Freuling et al., 2013</u></a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h1>2 &nbsp; Theory of change</h1><h2>2.1 &nbsp; Scope of the intervention</h2><p>The&nbsp;<strong>aim of this intervention is to reduce (and possibly eliminate) canine rabies, and consequently reduce rabies deaths in humans</strong>. This intervention only focuses on dog vaccination to reduce canine rabies incidences, not on dog population management (e.g., through sterilization or contraception)<strong>.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>As there are other large health organizations acting in this space (e.g., WHO,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rabiesalliance.org/\"><u>Global Alliance</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.woah.org/en/home/\"><u>World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH)</u></a>),&nbsp;<strong>cooperation with other stakeholders is likely to contribute to larger efforts aiming at eliminating dog-mediated rabies</strong>. Elimination of rabies could be achieved by combining a range of different strategies, such as information campaigns about dog bite prevention, increasing access to post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP), and dog vaccination (<a href=\"https://www.who.int/teams/control-of-neglected-tropical-diseases/rabies/control-and-elimination-strategies/proof-of-concept\"><u>WHO, n.d.</u></a>). The intervention researched in this report uses only one of these strategies, so I assume it could be integrated into larger rabies elimination campaigns. This means that working closely together with national and international health authorities in the field of rabies elimination could increase the impact of this intervention beyond the immediate reduction of human rabies cases. Cooperation with other actors could also help to coordinate and synchronize vaccination campaigns of this intervention with other vaccination campaigns, e.g., with parenteral vaccination of homestead dogs or campaigns in surrounding rural or urban areas (<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/14/1/155\"><u>Yale et al., 2022</u></a>).</p><h2>2.2 &nbsp; Causal chain</h2><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/euGHRkerLHQqeKSER/v7uxitmxrae1cou5gg35\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/euGHRkerLHQqeKSER/csyvs1llf1fhw7ns1cer 90w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/euGHRkerLHQqeKSER/adiufmcelfy7coj70zfk 180w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/euGHRkerLHQqeKSER/i0ros423eyispl81bn5f 270w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/euGHRkerLHQqeKSER/qchpcohvfg9eo3meokcq 360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/euGHRkerLHQqeKSER/sjhitpaivpdh17qzfguv 450w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/euGHRkerLHQqeKSER/r8xv2m0dxbzabix7z9fp 540w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/euGHRkerLHQqeKSER/c80kyv3371zsihogzvlv 630w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/euGHRkerLHQqeKSER/emyhx9rr3krqjeuqw3dw 720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/euGHRkerLHQqeKSER/u3l3d6qpnaf72js1f2ht 810w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/euGHRkerLHQqeKSER/vzr7tpxbevk5h8c3riwj 889w\"></figure><h3><strong>2.2.1 &nbsp; Staff training&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>The organization hires and trains vaccination teams which will vaccinate dogs. These teams consist of two to four veterinary staff, and will be trained in\u2014amongst other things\u2014bait handling, techniques for approaching dogs, methods of offering vaccine baits, recording vaccine bait handling by each dog, interpreting the effectiveness of the vaccination attempt, and retrieving discarded vaccine sachets after bait consumption.</p><h3><strong>2.2.2 &nbsp; Bait procurement</strong></h3><p>The organization (potentially in cooperation with partner organizations) procures industrial manufactured baits in large quantities and ships them to intervention locations. The logistics of this may be challenging since the baits need to be kept frozen throughout shipping and transporting. A few hours before vaccination teams offer the baits to dogs, the baits need to be thawed.</p><h3><strong>2.2.3 &nbsp; Bait distribution</strong></h3><p>At each intervention location, one or multiple vaccination teams move through the village, especially around places often frequented by free-roaming dogs, and distribute baits to those dogs they encounter. This distribution is called the \u201chand-out and retrieve\u201d method and has been used in several other trials of this intervention in the past (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33805404/#:~:text=As%20not%20all%20dogs%20were,vaccinated%20by%20the%20oral%20route.\"><u>Chanachai et al., 2021</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352771423000824\"><u>Freuling et al., 2023</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2414-6366/4/3/118\"><u>Gibson et al., 2019</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5904025/\"><u>Smith et al., 2017</u></a>). To avoid environmental pollution and minimize the risk of humans (especially children) and non-target animals coming into contact with the vaccine, the vaccination teams retrieve and properly dispose of all baits that have not been consumed. To know which dogs have already consumed a bait and prevent re-vaccinating dogs, they can be marked with temporary paint (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X20306927\"><u>Bonwitt et al., 2020</u></a>).</p><p>To ensure that the distributed baits are accepted and consumed by the majority of dogs, a trial to test out the acceptance of different baits might be included in the pilot program before rolling out the intervention on a larger scale.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>2.2.4 &nbsp; Cooperation with local communities&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>Previous to distributing baits in a community, the organization contacts local authorities in the village and informs them about the intervention. Depending on a country\u2019s or region\u2019s legal requirements around oral rabies vaccination distribution, official approval needs to be obtained. Further, official buy-in can be important in order to gain public support for the campaign and to not be met with villagers\u2019 misconceptions (e.g., people believing the baits are poisonous to kill or sterilize dogs).&nbsp;</p><p>The organization also seeks contact with locals, especially local caretakers of free-roaming dogs, in order to facilitate locating areas with the highest density of free-roaming dogs and to make the dogs feel more comfortable (and thus more likely to consume the bait) in caretakers\u2019 presence when distributing the baits.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>2.2.5 &nbsp; Monitoring&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>In order to make sure the vaccination was successful, the vaccination team monitors each dog closely while distributing the baits. Dogs need to chew the bait multiple times in order to perforate the sachet including the liquid vaccine, which then gets absorbed via a dog\u2019s oral mucosa. If a dog swallows the bait as a whole, it will likely not get immunized (<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/14/1/155\"><u>Yale et al., 2022</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Several studies and reports stress the importance of dog vaccination campaigns of reaching a critical vaccination coverage threshold (~70%) to effectively and permanently reduce canine dog incidences (<a href=\"https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.0904740106\"><u>Zinsstag et al., 2009</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.science.org/content/article/inside-global-campaign-get-rid-rabies\"><u>Stokstad, 2017</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0166354213001915\"><u>Franka et al., 2013</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/26-10-2023-new-recommendations-for-oral-vaccination-of-dogs-against-rabies\"><u>WHO, 2023</u></a>). For the organization to assess vaccination coverage in each village, it needs to estimate local dog population numbers as well as monitor vaccination success as described above. As coverage wanes over time (since the vaccine loses its immunity, new dogs are born, or unvaccinated dogs migrate to a given region), the immunization campaign likely needs to be repeated every year.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>2.2.6 &nbsp; Intervention result</strong></h3><p>As a result of the oral rabies vaccination campaigns, canine rabies incidence at the intervention locations&nbsp; is reduced, which leads to fewer dog bites (due to reduced aggressiveness in dogs) and to dog bites bearing a reduced risk of transmitting rabies to humans. Ultimately, the intervention aims to avert premature deaths from rabies.</p><h3><strong>2.2.7 &nbsp; Potential positive externalities of this intervention</strong></h3><p>According to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/pets/dogs/rabies-dogs\"><u>WebDM (2023)</u></a>, there is no rabies treatment for dogs, so&nbsp;<strong>vaccination is the only way to prevent dogs from suffering and dying from rabies</strong>. Rabies symptoms last around a week and include paralysis, seizures, breathing difficulties, swallowing difficulties, aggression and self-mutilation (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/specific_groups/veterinarians/clinical_signs.html#:~:text=Signs%20progress%20within%20days%20to,and%2For%20self%2Dmutilation.\"><u>CDC, 2011</u></a>), which imply a lot of suffering for a rabid dog in the days leading up to its death.&nbsp;</p><p>Vaccination does not only prevent dogs from contracting rabies, they&nbsp;<strong>might also protect from other infectious diseases</strong>. According to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28602607/\"><u>Knobel et al. (2017)</u></a>, rabies vaccination reduced the risk of death in dogs by 56\u201316% (depending on the dog\u2019s age). The study was done on parenteral vaccination, so the findings might not generalize to oral vaccination.</p><p>Lastly, reducing canine rabies cases through&nbsp;<strong>dog vaccination might decrease the use of dog culling as a way to reduce rabies incidence rates</strong>. In some regions in Africa and Asia, mass dog culling is used as a form of population control to respond to rabies outbreaks. However, this method is generally quite ineffective in controlling rabies (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5502273/\"><u>Taylor et al., 2017</u></a>). I am quite uncertain about this externality, since the effect of dog vaccination on dog culling practices likely relies on people\u2019s attitudes and beliefs around rabies transmission, which I have not looked into.</p><h3><strong>2.2.8 &nbsp; Potential negative externalities of this intervention</strong></h3><p>ORVs can pose risks to human and non-target animals if they come into contact with the vaccine. These risks are discussed in more detail in section 3.3.7.&nbsp;</p><p>As discussed in the previous section, effectively immunizing dogs against rabies means dogs have a reduced risk of dying from rabies and likely live longer. This has several implications:</p><ul><li>A dog\u2019s longer lifespan in and of itself might be a positive or negative externality depending on whether a dog\u2019s life is net positive or net negative. The intervention would largely target free-roaming (but mostly owned) dogs in LMICs, which means that these dogs are not confined and ideally get fed and maybe even taken care of if they get ill. However, free-roaming also means that they might be exposed to heat or cold and experience injuries.&nbsp;</li><li>Dogs that live longer can reproduce more often, which might increase the total dog population in a region, potentially leading to less available food (and thus reduced welfare) as well as mass dog culling to control the growing dog population.</li><li>Dogs relying on a meat-heavy diet and living longer will cause the suffering and killing of&nbsp; animals used as their food.&nbsp;</li><li>The baits used in oral vaccination campaigns are made of meat, fish or eggs. This means that if the intervention is carried out on a large scale, a significant amount of fish, meat or eggs are required, causing harm to the animals from which these products come.</li></ul><p>Developing a rabies vaccine for dogs likely involves&nbsp;<strong>animal testing in order to study the effectiveness of the vaccine</strong>. Some of the studies conducted might intentionally infect dogs with rabies in order to study the vaccine\u2019s effect, leading to dogs\u2019 suffering and death if the vaccine is ineffective. I have not researched if such studies are actually conducted. Assuming they are, it could be argued that these studies provide enough instrumental value (i.e., developing an effective dog vaccine that further down the line protects dogs from rabies) to justify the direct suffering and death inflicted on the studied dogs.</p><p>All of the&nbsp;<strong>externalities on dogs are highly uncertain and heavily depend on the probability of dogs\u2019 sentience, moral weight and overall welfare</strong>. However, due to the limited time available for this report, going forward I will only focus on the potential benefits for humans gained from this intervention. If this intervention were to be implemented, I strongly recommend further looking into the externalities on animal welfare given that the number of animals reached by this intervention could be high.</p><h2>2.3 &nbsp; Outlining assumptions and levels of uncertainty</h2><p><strong>1) Low uncertainty \u2013 ORVs and baits are readily available on the market and can be procured in bulk. </strong>Since at scale, this intervention would involve vaccinating potentially thousands of dogs, procuring dog rabies vaccines in large quantities is necessary in order to successfully implement vaccination campaigns.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2) Medium-high uncertainty \u2013 The necessary cool chain is maintained throughout all of shipping and transportation to the intervention location in order to protect the potency of the vaccine. </strong>Most dog rabies vaccines need to be stored and transported at freezing temperatures to maintain their potency (see section 1.5). Given that this intervention is most likely to be implemented in LMICs, robust cold chain infrastructure could pose difficulties.</p><p><strong>3) Medium uncertainty \u2013 Local authorities are open to cooperating and give their approval for ORV distribution. </strong>I assume that vaccination campaigns are more likely to be successful if local authorities are included in their implementation.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4) Medium uncertainty \u2013 Locals are open to cooperating and working together with vaccination teams. </strong>Similarly to the assumption above, I assume that vaccination campaigns are more successful if locals are involved, for example, to help identify places often frequented by free-roaming dogs and approach dogs.</p><p><strong>5) Medium-high uncertainty \u2013 ORV campaigns need to be repeated annually. </strong>I expect immunity to fade overtime in a given dog population that has been vaccinated, for example due to dog population turnover, dog migration or rabies transmission from wildlife. Thus, vaccination campaigns likely need to be repeated on a regular basis. My first guess is an annual interval.</p><p><strong>6) Low uncertainty \u2013 Free-roaming dogs pose a significant risk of transmitting rabies. </strong>ORV is especially well-suited for targeting dogs that are difficult to approach and vaccinate with a parenteral vaccine. Given that parenteral vaccines are generally less expensive than oral vaccines, this intervention would only make sense if a large proportion of rabies risk comes from free-roaming dogs.</p><p><strong>7) Low uncertainty \u2013 ORV does not pose risks to dogs, humans and non-target species. &nbsp;</strong>ORVs are usually live vaccines and may pose risks of infection or other adverse reactions when used for vaccinating dogs, or when humans or non-target animals accidently come into contact with distributed baits.</p><p><strong>8) Low uncertainty \u2013 The industrially manufactured egg bait has a high acceptance rate amongst targeted dogs. </strong>Given that egg baits are recommended by several studies (see section 1.5), the egg bait needs to be well accepted by dogs in order to be able to vaccinate a large number of dogs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>9) Low uncertainty \u2013 The ORV is effective in immunizing the dog against rabies. </strong>The intervention would make little sense if the vaccine itself proves to be ineffective.</p><p><strong>10) Low uncertainty \u2013 The ORV is effective in preventing dog-to-human transmission of rabies. </strong>This assumption goes hand in hand with the previous assumption and is fundamental for the intervention to make sense.</p><p><strong>11) Low uncertainty \u2013 Dog bites cause the majority of human rabies cases and there aren\u2019t any other major ways of transmission of rabies to humans. </strong>The effectiveness in the intervention depends on whether other animal species are a major rabies transmitter to humans. If so, only vaccinating dogs would only partly reduce human rabies cases and deaths.</p><p><strong>12) Low uncertainty \u2013 The people contracting rabies would not have access to PEP. </strong>Vaccinating dogs against rabies will only affect human rabies deaths if a substantial proportion of infected people do not have access to PEP.</p><p>I discuss all of these uncertainties in more detail in section 3.</p><h1>3 &nbsp; Quality of evidence</h1><p><u>Link to the spreadsheet: </u><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U-GR-e9URfe1TxMEkehoQIi1i0Ggd6XTVGMcwK5Sc8E/edit?usp=share_link\"><u>Evidence Review: Oral rabies vaccination of dogs</u></a></p><h2>3.1 &nbsp; Evidence that a charity can make a change in this space</h2><h3><strong>3.1.1 &nbsp; What vaccination coverage needs to be reached in order to control and prevent rabies outbreaks?</strong></h3><p>As laid out in section 1.4, the WHO recommends a vaccination rate of around 70% in order to manage canine rabies and keep infections at bay (<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/26-10-2023-new-recommendations-for-oral-vaccination-of-dogs-against-rabies\"><u>WHO, 2023</u></a>).

(2020)</u></a> modeled that their ORV campaign combined with parenteral door-to-door vaccination reached a vaccination rate of 78.3% (95% CI 77.0\u201380.0%) of the total dog population and 53.1% (95% CI 46.6\u201359.6%) of the free-roaming dog population. The gap in coverage between the free-roaming and total dog population might be explained by two details of the study: the vaccination teams defaulted to using parenteral vaccines and only used ORVs if a dog was not approachable; and the vaccination team ran out of ORV baits during the campaign. The results are of further limited generalizability since the campaign did not solely use ORV vaccines.</li></ul><p>Overall, the&nbsp;<strong>studies reviewed above provide only weak evidence</strong>, either because they did not estimate vaccination coverage for the whole dog population (only for identified dogs) or their campaign used parenteral vaccines in addition to oral vaccines. Further, the studies above were conducted in Thailand, Namibia and Haiti, respectively. It is unclear how the results generalize to a different country where conditions (e.g., dog population density, proportion of free-roaming dogs) may differ.</p><p>Furthermore,&nbsp;<strong>none of the above studies report a baseline vaccination rate for the region where they conducted the study</strong>. I assume that the higher the baseline coverage, the likelier it would be to reach the 70% vaccination threshold (i.e., if the baseline coverage was 10% instead of zero, reaching the 70% threshold would be more likely).&nbsp;</p><p>In light of the evidence presented in this section,&nbsp;<strong>my rough and quite intuitive estimation is that it is 30\u201380% likely that&nbsp; an ORV campaign can reach a 70% vaccination coverage of the total dog population at a given intervention location</strong>. The upper and lower bound should reflect that I expect that the 70% vaccination coverage could be quite difficult to reach but, as outlined above, might be more likely with a higher baseline coverage. One caveat to mention is that while a single campaign might not reach the 70% threshold, several subsequent campaigns might be, for example in one-year intervals. Immunity seems to last longer than one year, and subsequent campaigns could reach dogs that were missed in previous campaigns, which would increase the overall vaccination coverage.</p><p>The evidence review in this section is not exhaustive and I expect that given more time, additional studies could be found that could update my estimated probability range.&nbsp;</p><h2>3.2&nbsp; Evidence that the change has the expected effects</h2><h3><strong>3.2.1 &nbsp; How effective are ORV campaigns at reducing the incidence of dog-mediated rabies in humans?</strong></h3><p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12706685/\"><u>Cleaveland et al. (2003)</u></a> use a difference-in-difference experimental design to assess dog rabies and human dog-bite incidence rates in two districts in rural Tanzania, with one district getting four rabies vaccine campaigns (conducted in roughly 1-year intervals) and the other one acting as the control area. Each vaccination campaign in the intervention area reached a vaccination coverage of 61.1\u201370.6%. In the intervention area, the dog rabies incidence rates decreased by 64.9\u201393.8% (p&lt;0.001) and the human rabies incidence rates decreased by 51.0\u201392.0% (p&lt;0.001) after each campaign, compared to the baseline yearly incidences of 0.00146% (1 in 685 dogs) and 0.000288% (1 in 3470 people), respectively. In the same period in the control area, the canine dog incidence decreased by 17.2\u201337.1% (p=0.22) and the human dog incidence increased by 138.5\u2013163.3% (p=0.06), compared to the baseline of 0.01089% (1 in 91 dogs) and 0.000117% (1 in 8550 people), respectively. This study suggests vaccination campaigns have quite a large effect on dog rabies and human dog-bite incidence rates. However, the evidence is of limited strength, since the experimental design is not randomized, which means that the two districts could be systematically different from each other and the changes in incidence might not be entirely attributed to vaccination. The study further loses strength in failing to mention the exact sample size (it can be assumed that it includes &gt;20 villages).</p><p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29263230/\"><u>Zinsstag et al. (2017)</u></a> report canine and human rabies incidence rates after two vaccination campaigns (with a one-year interval in between) in one city in Chad. Both campaigns reached around 71% of dogs. While the baseline for the canine rabies incidence rate was 0.000033% (1 in 30,000 dogs) per week and the baseline for human rabies exposure rate 0.000001% (1 in 1,000,000 people) per week, the endline rate was 0.0000016% (1 in 635,000 dogs) and 0.000000002% (1 in 500,000,000 people), respectively, which mark a respective 95.2% and 99.8% decrease. While this study also suggests a very large effect of vaccination campaigns on incidences, the evidence is quite weak (weaker than&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12706685/\"><u>Cleaveland et al. (2003)</u></a>) since the experimental design was a simple pre-post comparison without a control group and had a sample size of n=1.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Notedly, the two studies are based on parenteral vaccination campaigns, not on ORV campaigns. However, I expect this to matter little if an ORV campaign reaches a similar vaccination coverage as the studies above do. Also,&nbsp;<strong>neither of the two studies looks at human rabies incidence directly, only at dog rabies and human dog-bite incidence</strong>. Not every bite from a rabid dog leads to rabies (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2244672/#:~:text=The%20risk%20of%20infection%20following,illness%20in%20the%20infected%20animal.\"><u>Di Quinzio &amp; McCarthy, 2008</u></a>), so the&nbsp;<strong>exact effect of vaccination on human rabies incidence and deaths remains unclear</strong>. It also has to be noted that while the effect observed in both studies is quite large, the baseline and endline incidence rates are quite low, which could reduce the cost-effectiveness of this intervention.</p><p>My evidence review for this section is not exhaustive and I expect that if I spent more time on it, I could find more studies on the effect of ORV campaigns on human rabies incidence. However, given that within the time I spent on this section I was only able to find two studies and no RCTs leads me to conclude that the overall evidence base on the effect of ORV campaigns is quite weak.</p><p>Overall, I base more weight on the study by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12706685/\"><u>Cleaveland et al. (2003)</u></a> due to its more robust experimental design. I discount their findings by 10% based on the fact that the study was not randomized and that it is unclear how generalizable the results are to other regions or countries. Thus,<strong> I estimate that annual vaccination campaigns (which reach the 70% vaccination coverage) can decrease canine rabies incidence rates by 51\u201361% and human dog-bite incidence rates by 55\u201382%</strong>.</p><p>A note on consideration around implementing this intervention: I expect monitoring dog and human rabies cases to be a major challenge requiring a robust reporting and surveillance infrastructure for regions and countries where there is not already one in place. Given that not all people with potential rabies exposure seek treatment (see section 3.2.3), monitoring rabies cases is likely not possible in a centralized (i.e., on the level of health facilities) manner without missing many potential rabies cases. This means that establishing a robust feedback mechanism for this intervention might be a far bigger challenge than I previously anticipated (and indicated in the theory of change).</p><h3><strong>3.2.2 &nbsp; What is the effect of reducing human rabies cases on the number of human rabies deaths?</strong></h3><p>Reducing the number of human rabies cases does not necessarily lead to reducing human rabies deaths, since many or even all of the cases could be effectively treated with PEP (since PEP is almost 100% effective if administered properly and in time (<a href=\"https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/272756/9789241513838-eng.pdf?sequence=1\"><u>FAO et al., 2018</u></a>)). Thus, in this section I want to assess&nbsp;<strong>what percentage of people do have access to PEP and whose death could counterfactually be averted by preventing them from contracting rabies in the first place</strong>:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6863039/\"><u>Changalucha et al. (2019)</u></a> find that across different rural and urban settings in Tanzania, 25% of people with probable rabies exposure did not seek PEP. Of those who did seek care, 15% did not receive PEP due to shortages, cost barriers or misadvice. Of those who received PEP, 46% did not complete the course. This means that of all people potentially exposed to rabies, only 34% of people received adequate PEP.</li><li><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31471150/\"><u>Sreenivasan et al. (2019)</u></a> find that the availability of post-exposure vaccination was limited in 7 out of the 22 (32%) African and Asian countries they assessed. No information on availability of immunoglobulin (which also forms part of PEP) is reported.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.scielosp.org/pdf/bwho/2005.v83n5/360-368\"><u>Knobel et al. (2005)</u></a> use an epidemiological model and estimate the number of rabies deaths in Africa and Asia to be 55,270 and predict the hypothetical number of deaths in the absence of any PEP to be 327,160. According to these numbers, 14% of people with rabies are estimated to not receive adequate PEP. While this study seems to be very comprehensive compared to the other studies, it is also almost 20 years old, so I put less weight on it. Furthermore, I expect PEP accessibility to vary widely from the reported average of 14% on a per-country basis.</li></ul><p>PEP accessibility is not the only relevant factor but also&nbsp;<strong>how willing people are to seek it out based on how much they know about the fatality of rabies and the existence of PEP</strong>. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/ijph/fulltext/2019/63050/community_awareness_and_risk_of_rabies_associated.5.aspx\"><u>Masthi et al. (2019)</u></a> found that in India, only 60.4% of participants (68.9% in urban and 56.5% in rural areas) had heard of rabies. Of those that knew about rabies,&nbsp; 72% (64.9% in urban and 76.1% in rural areas) were aware that it was a fatal disease. Upon rabies exposure, 63.5% would seek care at a medical facility, 22.9% would only wash the wound, 5.7% would apply traditional medicines and 9.5% would do nothing.</p><p>Given that I expect PEP accessibility and knowledge and practices around rabies to vary between regions and countries, it is difficult to conclude a general percentage of people whose life could be saved through preventing them from getting rabies in the first place.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6863039/\"><u>Changalucha et al. (2019)</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/ijph/fulltext/2019/63050/community_awareness_and_risk_of_rabies_associated.5.aspx\"><u>Masthi et al. (2019)</u></a> provide the most detailed data, but their findings are limited to one specific country each. As a rough estimate,&nbsp;<strong>I thus think on average 25\u201345% of people with rabies do not receive adequate PEP</strong>. This is somehow close to the proportion observed by the two studies but with a wider range due to my high uncertainty. However, depending on the exact intervention location, the number could be much higher. People in rural areas might have more difficulties accessing PEP so if ORV campaigns were conducted in these areas, it could be possible to avert more deaths, everything else being equal.</p><p>As in the previous section, the evidence review in this section is not exhaustive and I am quite certain that given more time, additional studies could be found that would update my estimation.&nbsp;</p><h2>3.3&nbsp; Evidence on other key uncertainties</h2><p>Due to time constraints, I spent the majority of the time for this section on the uncertainties marked as orange and yellow in section 2.3. For assumptions marked as green, only a limited amount of literature was reviewed, and reviewed superficially.</p><h3><strong>3.3.1 &nbsp; ORVs and baits are readily available on the market and can be procured in bulk</strong></h3><p>Unfortunately, I did not find any direct information on the mass availability of ORVs. What makes me positively update is the fact that the global oral rabies vaccine market is predicted to grow from $80 million in 2022 to $297 million in 2029 (<a href=\"https://www.qyresearch.com/reports/1632783/oral-rabies-vaccine\"><u>QYR Research, 2023</u></a>). Currently, there seem to be three big ORV producers\u2014Boehringer Ingelheim, Virbac, Ceva Sant\u00e9 Animale\u2014and one large egg-bait producer\u2014IDT Biologika. ORVs are also currently used in mass vaccination campaigns, for example a racoon vaccination campaign in the US using 365,000 baits (<a href=\"https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/newsroom/news/SA_By_Date/SA-2023/orv-vaccine-efforts\"><u>USDA, 2023</u></a>). In the past, they were used in mass vaccination campaigns for foxes in Europe (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3720040/\"><u>Freuling et al., 2013</u></a>). One piece of information that makes me slightly negatively update is the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rr-asia.woah.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/kinzang-dukpa_woah-orv-activities.pdf\"><u>WOAH (2022)</u></a> reporting that currently only limited ORVs are produced due to less demand. However, it is unclear what absolute number of ORVs falls under \u201climited\u201d. Overall, I think the positive evidence weighs more heavily than the negative one, which is why I am quite certain of this assumption.</p><h3><strong>3.3.2 &nbsp; The necessary cold chain is maintained throughout all of shipping and transportation to the intervention location in order to protect the potency of the vaccine</strong></h3><p>Many oral rabies vaccines, including the egg bait recommended for ORV campaigns, have the big disadvantage of needing to be&nbsp;<strong>stored at deep freezing temperatures (at around -18 to -20\u00b0C) until they can be thawed and kept in a cooler until their field use</strong> (<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0010422\"><u>Freuling et al., 2022</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33805404/#:~:text=As%20not%20all%20dogs%20were,vaccinated%20by%20the%20oral%20route.\"><u>Chanachai et al., 2021</u></a>). This makes the logistics of transporting ORVs from the producer to the intervention location much more difficult since vaccines need to be part of a robust cold chain, otherwise they lose their potency (<a href=\"https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/373617/9789240082731-eng.pdf?sequence=1\"><u>WHO, 2023</u></a>). These cooling requirements make me highly uncertain about recommending this type of bait after all, since there seem to be other vaccines which only need to be kept at cooling temperatures of 4\u20138\u00b0C (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5904025/\"><u>Smith et al., 2017</u></a>). However, the choice of which vaccine to use is not only dependent on storage requirements but also on its acceptance by dogs, vaccine release and time needed for manufacturing baits (if industrially manufactured baits are not used). So in this section I will still assume that the intervention will use egg baits, and look into cold chain logistics required for transporting them.</p><p>In general, cold chains seem to be a substantial problem in LMICs. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10099644/\"><u>Kasahun et al. (2023)</u></a> find in their meta analysis that \u201cthe overall/pooled prevalence of good vaccine cold chain management practice in Ethiopia is 27.48% with 95% CI (25.70\u201329.26).\u201d&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(13)61279-9/fulltext\"><u>Burstein et al. (2013)</u></a> found that in Ghana, Kenya and Uganda, around 17% of storage facilities stored vaccines outside of recommended temperatures. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/272994/WHO-IVB-17.20-eng.pdf?sequence=1\"><u>WHO (2017)&nbsp;</u></a>reports that dysfunction cold chains seem to be an issue for vaccine distribution in general.&nbsp;</p><p>What makes me slightly more certain of this assumption holding is the fact that both&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33805404/#:~:text=As%20not%20all%20dogs%20were,vaccinated%20by%20the%20oral%20route.\"><u>Chanachai et al.

(2022)</u></a> used the egg baits and seemed to have successfully managed the cold chain logistics. Nevertheless, their studies took place at a much smaller scale than an organization implementing this intervention potentially would.</p><p>Based on the cold chain management by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33805404/#:~:text=As%20not%20all%20dogs%20were,vaccinated%20by%20the%20oral%20route.\"><u>Chanachai et al. (2021)</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0010422\"><u>Freuling et al. (2022)</u></a>, I imagine transportation could look like the following: ORVs could be shipped on dry ice from the producers to a large city (which is more likely to have stable electricity and freezers) in the operating country. Up until then, already existing cold chain logistics could be used. After that, portable cold boxes filled with dry ice could be used to transport vaccines to the intervention location. Dry ice can last around 24\u201348h if cool boxes are properly sealed off (<a href=\"https://www.lindedirect.com/frequently-asked-questions/gas-information/how-long-does-dry-ice-last\"><u>Linde Gas &amp; Equipment Inc., n.d.</u></a>) and I expect transportation from the central storage to the intervention location will not take more than two days. At the intervention location, the ORVs can already start thawing since they generally last around three days when refrigerated. This would eliminate the need for freezers at the intervention location and only require refrigerators. Vaccination teams could take refrigerators with them to the intervention location (this would require stable electricity at the location), or use available refrigerators or ice packs at primary health care centers. As vaccines should not be thawed and refrozen, vaccination teams need to make sure to only take as many vaccines with them as they need, since the vaccines they will not use will likely perish. One potential way to reduce the risk of exposing vaccines to high temperatures if the cold chain fails is planning vaccination campaigns for cooler months of the year (<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1999-4915/14/1/155\"><u>Yale et al., 2022</u></a>), although this could pose a limitation when aligning ORV campaigns with other rabies vaccination campaigns.</p><p>All in all,&nbsp;<strong>I remain highly uncertain of this assumption, since a large part of the cold chain logistics remain outside the control of the organization</strong> (e.g., transportation to central storage, electricity access). The development of a vaccine that does not need to be frozen (or ideally cooled) would be a game changer, and it seems like initial&nbsp; efforts to do this are already made (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4398650/\"><u>Smith et al., 2015</u></a>).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3.3.3 &nbsp; Local authorities are open to cooperating and give their approval for ORV distribution</strong></h3><p>A range of trials of this intervention have already been conducted (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29734697/\"><u>Kasemsuwan et al., 2018</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.oaepublish.com/articles/ohir.5655.YXJ0aWNsZWlk\"><u>Husein et al., 2023</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33805404/#:~:text=As%20not%20all%20dogs%20were,vaccinated%20by%20the%20oral%20route.\"><u>Chanachai et al., 2021</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30270876/\"><u>Bender et al., 2017</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6789727/\"><u>Gibson et al., 2019</u></a>), which is weak but positive evidence that authorities will be willing to cooperate. Paired with the general positive public attitudes towards rabies vaccination (see section 3.3.4), I am somehow certain this assumption would hold, but given the limited time I spent researching this assumption, I will keep it marked as \u201cmedium uncertainty\u201d.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3.3.4 &nbsp; Locals are open to cooperating and working together with vaccination teams</strong></h3><p>Studies on people\u2019s attitude towards rabies vaccination is positive evidence that this assumption would hold:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10482259/#:~:text=Out%20of%20422%20respondents%2C%20421,had%20not%20vaccinated%20their%20dogs.\"><u>Iddi et al.

(2017)</u></a> found that after a dog vaccination campaign in Haiti, 59.3\u201377.8% of dogs which consumed an oral vaccine showed antibodies, compared to 92.7% of dogs who received a parenteral vaccine.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2021.737250/full\"><u>Molini et al. (2021)</u></a> found that after an ORV campaign in Namibia, 52.9\u201378.8% of dogs who consumed an oral vaccine showed antibodies (while 10% of dogs already showed antibodies prior to vaccination).</li></ul><p>The wide ranges are due to measuring antibody levels in two different ways (i.e., ELISA and RFFIT), which I did not have time to look into. Interestingly, the interviewed experts (see section 5) noted that the 70% vaccination coverage already accounts for not all vaccines distributed to dogs being effective, so the coverage is based on the number of dogs consuming and chewing the bait, instead of the number of dogs that show antibodies.</p><p>I weigh both of these results equally strong, since&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5904025/\"><u>Smith et al. (2017)</u></a> included a larger sample size and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2021.737250/full\"><u>Molini et al.

(2017)</u></a> used intestine baits).</p><h3><strong>3.3.10 &nbsp; The ORV is effective in preventing dog-to-human transmission of rabies</strong></h3><p>This assumption is discussed in section 3.2.1.</p><h3><strong>3.3.11 &nbsp; Dog bites cause the majority of human rabies cases and there aren\u2019t any other major ways of transmission of rabies to humans.</strong></h3><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies\"><u>WHO (2023)</u></a> states that virtually all human rabies cases stem from dog bites. While rabies can be theoretically transmitted from an infected person, no such case has been documented (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/transmission/index.html\"><u>CDC, 2019</u></a>).</p><h3><strong>3.3.12 &nbsp; The people contracting rabies would not have access to PEP&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>This assumption is discussed in section 3.2.2.</p><h1>4 &nbsp; Expert views</h1><p><strong>Dr Thomas M\u00fcller and Dr Conrad Freuling</strong><br>(World Health Organization Collaborating Centre for Rabies Surveillance and Research;&nbsp; World Organisation for Animal Health Reference Laboratory for Rabies; Institute of Molecular Virology and Cell Biology, Friedrich-Loeffler-Institut)</p><p>The main insight Dr M\u00fcller and Dr Freuling gave me was that&nbsp;<strong>a small- to medium-scale ORV campaign will not be effective in reducing rabies long-term:</strong></p><ul><li>Even if a vaccination campaign achieves a high vaccination coverage in a given region (and effectively reduces the number of human rabies cases), the region needs a system of constant rabies surveillance and strict border control when introducing dogs or other animals from outside (like they are implemented in rabies-free regions in Europe, for example). In the absence of these monitoring and control mechanisms, the canine rabies rate will increase again fast.&nbsp;</li><li>Vaccination campaigns need to be rolled out over a large area\u2014ideally a whole country or even across multiple countries\u2014and over a short time period (one or more weeks as opposed to a year) in order to increase the vaccination coverage in the whole region all at once. Doing so requires close cooperation of regional, national, and ideally international authorities, a regional/national/international strategy and both substantial financial resources as well as surveillance infrastructure to tackle the problem at a large scale. One prime example of a large-scale rabies control effort is Latin America, where national governments drove rabies control programs in their respective countries and closely cooperated with other governments in Latin America as well as the Pan American Health Organisation (PAHO), permanently reducing rabies cases.</li><li>While smaller efforts (for example by V\u00e9t\u00e9rinaires Sans Fronti\u00e8res) can reduce local infection sources, these changes will only be temporary, especially without a necessary follow-up strategy.</li><li>They stated that&nbsp;<strong>many countries in Africa and Southeast Asia\u2014where rabies control is still very neglected\u2014seem unwilling or incapable of investing in rabies control efforts</strong>. Although the WOAH, FAO and WHO provide tools for governments to work out national rabies control strategies, uptake of these tools is low. Large-scale vaccination campaigns are relatively expensive and there is a lack of funding in this space (or countries are unwilling to allocate money) since rabies causes fewer deaths than other infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis. Dr M\u00fcller and Dr Freuling pointed out that this is an area where a charity could make an impact:&nbsp;<strong>convincing governments to invest in, build the infrastructure for and develop strategies around rabies control</strong>.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Apart from these high-level insights, the expert interview&nbsp;<strong>corrected some concrete findings of my research and filled some gaps in my report</strong>:</p><ul><li>The 70% vaccination coverage already accounts for dog population turnover, and it is not based on the number of dogs who show antibodies after vaccinating, but on the number of dogs who chew the ORV bait and thus are considered vaccinated.</li><li>Rabies not only causes human and animal deaths but also results in people\u2019s financial loss since many farm animals get bitten by dogs and die of rabies, depriving many families of one of their main sources of income.</li><li>Reported data in the field of rabies is very poor due to lack of proper surveillance and reporting infrastructure. Actual rabies deaths might be 20 and 160 times higher than official numbers reported in Asia and Africa, respectively.</li><li>Countries and regions in Southeast Asia that already have a robust national rabies strategy include Thailand and Goa (India), as well as Vietnam, Cambodia and Iran, which have heavily invested in PEP accessibility. In Africa, Tanzania seems to be one of the countries with the most progress, and some efforts are made in Namibia.</li></ul><h1>5 &nbsp; Geographic assessment</h1><p><u>Link to the spreadsheet: </u><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NJPduax_Iag1Wm62ZuW3wnrUG1XxCMOKRENGQAMAjTA/edit?usp=share_link\"><u>Geographic Assessment: Oral rabies vaccination of dogs</u></a></p><h2>5.1 &nbsp; Geographic assessment</h2><p>I developed a geographic weight factor model (GWFM) to identify countries in which this intervention could be implemented at scale as well as be tractable.</p><p>The model uses a lot of proxy indicators since no country-level data was available for many factors I wanted to include. This includes data on (free-roaming) dog populations, PEP accessibility, rabies vaccination coverage in dogs, human rabies incidence, human dog-bite incidence. In some cases, this data might exist spread across multiple sources and studies, so collating this data would have been time intensive and falls outside the scope of this report.</p><h3><strong>5.1.1 &nbsp; Scale (45%)</strong></h3><p><strong>Population (40%): </strong>Population shows how many people would benefit from a reduced canine rabies and dog-bite incidence. It also serves as a proxy for the dog population of each country. This assumes an equal human-to-dog ratio in each country, which is likely not the case but unfortunately I was unable to obtain this ratio for each country. Dog population shows how many dogs could be potentially targeted by the intervention.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Rabies death rate (60%): </strong>The rabies death rate per 10,000 capita is based on Global Burden of Disease data and includes deaths of any age and of both sexes. It is probably the most important factor on the model, since it directly shows the burden of disease from rabies in each country<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefu4kpfurqjka\"><sup><a href=\"#fnu4kpfurqjka\">[7]</a></sup></span>. The rabies death rate does not only indicate the scale of the problem, it also shows its neglectedness. Rabies has been eliminated using mass vaccination campaigns in many countries. In addition, in many countries access to PEP prevents almost all exposed people from dying. This means that countries with a higher rabies death rate probably have a higher canine rabies incidence (i.e., more people get bitten by rabid dogs) and/or do not receive adequate treatment. The latter aspect is included in the neglectedness section.</p><h3><strong>5.1.2 &nbsp; Tractability (35%)</strong></h3><p><strong>Logistics Performance Index (25%): </strong>As discussed in section 3.3.2, transporting oral rabies vaccines and maintaining the necessary cold chain might pose significant difficulties. The Logistics Performance Index combines country information on customs, infrastructure, international shipments, logistics quality and competence, tracking and tracing, and timeliness (<a href=\"https://lpi.worldbank.org/sites/default/files/2023-04/Methodology_LPI_survey.pdf\"><u>World Bank, 2023</u></a>), and should broadly capture the general logistics capacity of each country.</p><p><strong>Electricity Access (25%): </strong>I am uncertain whether the Logistics Performance Indicator captures information on cold chains performance specifically. Thus, electricity access is added to serve as a proxy to indicate how stable cold chains are in each country, since freezers and refrigerators require electricity. The dataset defines electricity access as the share of population with access to electricity and is probably an overestimation of the available electricity for cold chains, since it it is defined as having an electricity source that can provide very basic lighting, charge a phone, or power a radio for four hours a day (<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/share-of-the-population-with-access-to-electricity\"><u>Our World in Data, 2020</u></a>). Vaccines, however, need to be cooled or frozen continuously until they are used, and freezers and refrigerators require more electric power than basic lighting.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Fragile State Index (25%): </strong>The Fragile State Index combined information on social cohesion (e.g., security apparatus), economy (e.g., economic development), politics (e.g., state legitimacy) and society (e.g., demographic pressures) (<a href=\"https://fragilestatesindex.org/excel/\"><u>Fragile State Index, 2023</u></a>) and serves as a marker for general ease of operationality in a country.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Robust national rabies surveillance (25%): </strong>Monitoring and evaluating the impact of ORV campaigns is probably much easier if data is available about rabies outbreaks and cases. I assume it would be very costly (both in terms of time and money) for an organization to collect this data itself, so relying on an already existing rabies surveillance system could make the intervention more cost-effective and provide an additional feedback mechanism. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/resources/countries-risk.html\"><u>CDC (n.d.)</u></a> considers a country\u2019s national rabies surveillance as robust \u201cif formal surveillance reports (including methodologies and results) are available in the form of publications, government reports, or other submissions satisfying international reporting requirements\u201d.</p><h3><strong>5.1.3 &nbsp; Neglectedness (20%)&nbsp;</strong></h3><p><strong>Universal Health Coverage &amp; Service Coverage Index (25%): </strong>Reducing rabies deaths can be tackled from two sides: treating rabies cases or preventing them. While countries with a high rabies death rate probably have a high canine rabies incidence, rabies treatment is likely also not available or else not so many people would die. This means that preventing rabies cases in countries with worse access to treatment can counterfactually avert more deaths. Several studies include data on the availability and cost for PEP, although data for different countries is scattered across multiple studies and is not available for every country. Due to time constraints, I was not able to collate data from different sources and instead used the Universal Health Coverage &amp; Service Coverage Index as a proxy for PEP accessibility. It is based on \u201cthe average coverage of essential services including reproductive, maternal, newborn and child health, infectious diseases, non-communicable diseases and service capacity and access\u201c (<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/universal-health-coverage-index\"><u>OWID, 2022</u></a>). While some of this information is irrelevant for rabies (e.g., maternal, newborn and child health), it is the information on infectious diseases which is why I included the index in the model.</p><p><strong>Global Multidimensional Poverty Index (25%): </strong>The Global Multidimensional Poverty Index combines information on health, education and standard of living (<a href=\"https://hdr.undp.org/content/2023-global-multidimensional-poverty-index-mpi#/indicies/MPI\"><u>UNDP, 2023</u></a>). According to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0011204\"><u>Taylor et al. (2013)</u></a>, the GMPI is highly correlated with PEP accessibility, which is why I included it in addition to the Universal Health Coverage &amp; Service Coverage Index.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>National rabies control program (50%): </strong>If a country already has a robust rabies control program in place, it means an organization might have less marginal impact in this country. According to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/resources/countries-risk.html\"><u>CDC (n.d.)</u></a>, \u201ca robust national canine rabies control program is evidenced by control measures (such as dog rabies vaccination coverage), significant reduction in cases, and/or transmission limited to focal areas as documented in publications or reports in the past 5 years\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>Existing organizations are not included in the model, since conducting research on all countries would go beyond the scope of this report. Instead, I will look at existing organizations in the top 10 countries according to the GWFM in the next section.</p><h2>5.2 &nbsp; Where existing organizations work</h2><p>None of the top ten countries have a national rabies control program (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/rabies/resources/countries-risk.html\"><u>CDC, n.d.</u></a>). In terms of other actors in this space,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rabiesalliance.org/networks/paracon\"><u>Paracon</u></a> is active in Ghana, Ethiopia, Niger, Mali and Nigeria. However, Paracon does not conduct rabies vaccination campaigns itself but supports governments and other stakeholders to plan and conduct rabies control programs in general. As far as India is concerned,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://goarabiescampaign.in/research/\"><u>Mission Rabies</u></a> is operating in Goa. However, they also do not seem to be conducting ORV campaigns but they conduct and provide research to help inform national rabies strategy. In addition, there are several international actors, including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.unitedagainstrabies.org/\"><u>United Against Rabies</u></a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rabiesalliance.org/\"><u>Global Alliance for Rabies Control</u></a>, and the WHO.</p><p>Based on the above findings,&nbsp;<strong>there seem to be no organizations exclusively dedicated to oral vaccination of dogs</strong> in the identified priority countries. I only spent around 1.5 hours researching existing organizations, so it is quite likely I overlooked some.&nbsp;</p><h1>6 &nbsp; Cost-effectiveness analysis</h1><p><u>Link to the spreadsheet: </u><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1-YzXYMQWp7YdCpfqt9Qv7iA4nhJAxUrhyeoINDgr1XM/edit?usp=share_link\"><u>Cost-effectiveness Analysis: Oral rabies vaccination of dogs</u></a></p><p>My cost-effectiveness analysis models a hypothetical 5-year program in India, where each targeted village would receive three vaccination campaigns in one-year intervals.</p><p>The&nbsp;<strong>estimated cost-effectiveness of the modeled intervention is $54,268 per averted DALY</strong>. According to my model, this intervention would not pass the bar of cost-effectiveness of ~$100 per averted DALY. Moreover, the extent of the impact of this intervention seems to be very limited, with&nbsp;<strong>0.5 rabies deaths averted in total</strong>. Notably, the upper and lower bounds of the cost-effectiveness estimate are very wide (I address this issue in section 6.3).&nbsp;</p><h2>6.1 &nbsp; Effects</h2><p>I modeled the effects of a rabies vaccination program as follows:</p><p><strong>Reach: </strong>The reach of the intervention is based on the number of vaccination teams of the organization, the human and dog population per village in which a vaccination campaign is conducted, and the time needed to conduct a vaccination campaign in a given village. This results in an estimate in how many villages an ORV campaign could be conducted, how many dogs would be vaccinated and how many humans could experience the effects.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Intervention effect: </strong>The most reliable study I found which looked at the effect of rabies vaccination on rabies incidence provided results for the change in dog rabies incidence and human dog-bite incidence, as opposed to looking at human rabies cases or human rabies deaths directly (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12706685/\"><u>Cleaveland et al., 2003</u></a>). The study looks at the effects of a three-year vaccination campaign (with vaccines being delivered roughly every year), which is why my modeled intervention also looks at a three-year campaign. The follow-up period of this study is three years; however, I try to model the effects over 10 years, which is why after year 4, the intervention effect is based on my estimation rather on the study.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Baseline dog rabies and dog-bite incidence: </strong>The baseline dog rabies incidence is based on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6733466/\"><u>Gill et al. (2019)</u></a> and the baseline dog-bite incidence is cited from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213398421001123\"><u>John et al. (2022)</u></a>. According to the interviewed experts (see section 5), rabies incidence rates are often an underestimate due to underreporting, which is why I increase the cited numbers by 50\u2013200%.</p><p><strong>Rabies transmission risk: </strong>Not all bites from rabid dogs lead to rabies infection. Unfortunately, I only found one study (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2244672/#:~:text=The%20risk%20of%20infection%20following,illness%20in%20the%20infected%20animal.\"><u>Di Quinzio &amp; McCarthy, 2008</u></a>) looking at rabies transmission risk.</p><p><strong>PEP accessibility: </strong>In order to account for humans with rabies who would get effectively treated (and therefore not benefit from rabies prevention), I used my estimation of the proportion of people having access to PEP from section 3.2.2. Given that I assume the intervention would be implemented in a region with particularly low accessibility, I substantially increased the upper bound.</p><p><strong>Discounts: </strong>The study by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12706685/\"><u>Cleaveland et al. (2003)</u></a> took place over 20 years ago in Tanzania, which is why I apply a relatively high generalizability discount. I also apply a certainty discount based on the fact that not only the data of the intervention effect but also for other factors is not very robust. Finally, an \u201cother-actors\u201d discount is applied to account for the impact of other actors who might work on rabies control measures in the hypothetical intervention region.</p><p><strong>DALY equivalents per premature death: </strong>I use the moral weights by Founder\u2019s Pledge in combination with the rough age distribution of rabies victims in order to get to an average number of lost DALYs per premature death caused by rabies.</p><p>Overall, the effect of the intervention results from comparing what would happen in the hypothetical intervention region to the counterfactual scenario (i.e., in the absence of the intervention). This means that with the factors outlined above, I calculate the number of rabies deaths that would occur in the intervention region and the number of rabies deaths in the absence of the program. I then subtract one from the other to obtain the number of averted rabies deaths as a result of the program.</p><h2>6.2 &nbsp; Costs</h2><p><strong>Start-up charity costs: </strong>For better comparability, start-up costs are held constant over all reports.</p><p><strong>Ongoing charity costs: </strong>Ongoing charity costs include salaries for five staff members over five years, plus overhead costs.</p><p><strong>Costs per vaccinated dog: </strong>Instead of modeling vaccination costs myself, I relied on the model by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.04.10.23288318v2.full\"><u>Cuddington &amp; McAuliffe, 2023</u></a>, which estimated costs of $2.90\u20137.90 per vaccinated dog for campaigns in India. These estimates already include salaries for the vaccination teams, vaccination baits, and vehicle and fuel costs for vaccine delivery. However, they do not seem to include costs for cooling equipment, protection equipment, time spent assessing the achieved vaccination coverage in each village and any unexpected costs, which is why I apply a substantial overhead to the cited costs.</p><p>Overall, the costs of the program are the sum of start-up and ongoing intervention costs as well as the cost per vaccinated dog multiplied by the number of dogs being vaccinated according to the expected reach of the program (see section 6.2).&nbsp;</p><h2>6.3 &nbsp; Limitations</h2><h3><strong>6.3.1 &nbsp; Excluded factors</strong></h3><p>There are several factors that could lead to the CEA model being an underestimate or overestimate of the real cost-effectiveness:</p><ul><li>The&nbsp;<strong>economic losses due to rabies are not included</strong> in my CEA, which could mean that the modeled cost-effectiveness is an underestimate.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003709\"><u>Hampson et al. (2015)</u></a> estimate that every year in India, $9,050 are lost due to rabies deaths of livestock, and $491,230 are spent on PEP (excluding $42,600 for travel costs and $138,030 for lost income due to seeking treatment). However, it is unclear whether the costs for treatment (plus associated costs) would really be saved as a result of this intervention, since dog rabies needs to be virtually eliminated before a reduction in demand in PEPE becomes apparent (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12706685/\"><u>Cleaveland et al., 2003</u></a>).&nbsp;</li><li>In my CEA, the&nbsp;<strong>DALY burden relies entirely on years of life lost (YLL)</strong>. This is backed up by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0003709\"><u>Hampson et al. (2015)</u></a> who notes that &gt;99% of the burden of disease of rabies stems from premature death. However, it could be the case that the psychological impact on bite victims and their families are larger than previously assumed. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://era.ed.ac.uk/handle/1842/29824\"><u>Kaare (2007)</u></a> finds that 87% of households with dog-bite victims in rural Tanzania feared rabies more than malaria due to unaffordability and unavailability of effective treatment.&nbsp;</li><li>Lastly, my&nbsp;<strong>CEA does not factor in the effect of this intervention on vaccinated dogs</strong>. Since there is no effective treatment against rabies for dogs, vaccination seems to be the only way to prevent dogs from dying of rabies. Whether averting dogs\u2019 deaths is good or bad relies on a range of factors (see sections 2.2.7 and 2.2.8). However, as is the case with the estimated number of averted human deaths, the estimated number of averted dog deaths of this intervention is very low\u2014around 17.</li></ul><p>Overall, while these factors could change the cost-effectiveness of the modeled intervention, I do not expect them to have a substantially large effect that would make this intervention cost-effective.</p><h3><strong>6.3.2 &nbsp; Assumptions under which the intervention would be cost-effective</strong></h3><p>The&nbsp;<strong>modeled best-case and worst-case cost-effectiveness are extremely far apart</strong>: $201 and $194,819,820 per averted DALY, respectively. This wide gap makes me doubtful about the reliability of my CEA. To strengthen the trustworthiness of my model, I analyze where this wide gap comes from and under which assumption this intervention would be cost-effective.</p><p>Comparing the estimated costs of the program in the best and worst case, it can be seen that they are not extraordinarily far apart ($923,000 vs. $1,612,000). This means that the&nbsp;<strong>large gap between best and worst case cost-effectiveness primarily stems from the modeled effects</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Running a basic sensitivity analysis on my model, the&nbsp;<strong>effects of the intervention primarily rely on the baseline dog rabies incidence, baseline dog-bite incidence and rabies transmission risk</strong>. Unfortunately, I am not very confident in the numbers cited for these factors in my model. The estimate for rabies transmission relies on a single study (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2244672/#:~:text=The%20risk%20of%20infection%20following,illness%20in%20the%20infected%20animal.\"><u>Di Quinzio &amp; McCarthy, 2008</u></a>), which is all the evidence I could find. The numbers cited for the two baseline rates come from studies based on estimates from India (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6733466/\"><u>Gill et al., 2019</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213398421001123\"><u>John et al., 2022</u></a>). The cited incidence rates are fairly low which is ultimately why the cost-effectiveness and total impact of the intervention are so low. Studies conducted in other countries report a far higher rabies incidence, for example one order of magnitude higher in Ethiopia (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3649954/#:~:text=We%20found%20an%20annual%20estimated,cases%20per%20100%2C000%20in%20goats.\"><u>Jemberu et al., 2013</u></a>) and up to two orders of magnitude higher in Tanzania (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12706685/\"><u>Cleaveland et al., 2003</u></a>; note that this study is already over 20 years old). In addition, the interviewed experts (see section 5) noted that rabies cases are usually underreported and that actual rabies deaths can be up to 20 times higher than official numbers. As a result, I already increased the two baseline incidence rates in my model by 50\u2013200%\u2014but the intervention still turned out to be cost-ineffective.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Another indication that the two incidence rates and rabies transmission risk are a lot higher than studies shows is the following: taking the total Indian population\u2014around 1,408,000,000 according to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/population-and-demography?facet=none&amp;country=CHN~IND~USA~IDN~PAK&amp;hideControls=false&amp;Metric=Population&amp;Sex=Both+sexes&amp;Age+group=Total&amp;Projection+Scenario=None\"><u>Our World in Data (2022)</u></a>\u2014and multiplying it by the dog rabies incidence, dog-bite incidence and rabies transmission risk would result in around 800 rabies deaths (geometric mean scenario) per year in India. In contrast, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/india/health-topics/rabies#:~:text=True%20burden%20of%20rabies%20in,often%20go%20unrecognized%20and%20unreported.\"><u>WHO (n.d.)</u></a> states that India has around 18,000\u201320,000 rabies deaths per year. However,&nbsp;<strong>even if I increase the incidence rates and rabies transmission risk to roughly result in the number of deaths similar to official numbers</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2cchdukv6oh\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2cchdukv6oh\">[8]</a></sup></span><strong>, the intervention does not turn out to be cost-effective&nbsp;</strong>(~12 averted deaths at ~$2,500 per averted DALY). In the best-case scenario of my CEA, the baseline rates and rabies transmission risk actually add up to a number similar to officially reported rabies deaths, but even then the intervention would not be cost-effective (~100 averted deaths at ~$200 per averted DALY).&nbsp;<strong>Only assuming incidence rates and a rabies transmission risk corresponding to 20 times that of the reported human rabies deaths in India would the intervention start to get cost-effective</strong> (~250 averted deaths at ~$106 per averted DALY).&nbsp;</p><p>This analysis shows that even assuming the most optimistic case for particularly weighty factors in my model does not make the intervention cost-effective.</p><h1>7 &nbsp; Conclusion</h1><p>Overall, my view is that oral rabies vaccination for dogs is not a recommendable intervention.</p><p>Even under the most optimistic assumptions, this intervention would only have a modest impact and not be particularly cost-effective in terms of dollars spent per averted DALY.</p><p>While there are many studies about oral rabies vaccination trials which look at campaigns\u2019 effectiveness in terms of vaccinating a large proportion of a region\u2019s dog population, there is no evidence on the link between rabies vaccines and reduction in human rabies cases and deaths and weak evidence on the reduction on dog rabies incidence and human dog-bite incidence.</p><p>Finally, the interviewed experts had a negative view on any work done in this space that is anything other than a large-scale nationally-coordinated implementation, ideally spanning several different countries and involving robust ongoing rabies surveillance.</p><p>Further research could look into alternative interventions in this space, such as providing sterilization or contraception for dogs, as well as lobbying for governments to invest in, build the infrastructure for and develop strategies around rabies control.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnykrd2cvtce9\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefykrd2cvtce9\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>The WHO lists rabies as one of the neglected tropical diseases (NTD) since it affects already poor, marginalized and vulnerable groups (<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/rabies\"><u>WHO, 2023</u></a>).</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnqsvh0bcqldi\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefqsvh0bcqldi\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;While elimination refers to \u201cthe deliberate effort that leads to the reduction to zero of the incidence of infection caused by a specific agent in a defined geographic area\u201d, eradication refers to \u201ca deliberate effort that leads to the permanent reduction to zero of the worldwide incidence of infection caused by a specific agent\u201d (<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/eradication-of-diseases#:~:text=Without%20an%20effective%20treatment%20against,the%20disease%20from%20its%20host.\"><u>Our World in Data, 2018</u></a>).

All of the following <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?source=ig&amp;hl=en&amp;rlz=&amp;=&amp;q=define%3A+pacifism&amp;aq=0&amp;aqi=l1g2&amp;aql=&amp;oq=pacifism+def&amp;gs_rfai=\"><strong>definitions</strong></a> aptly describe what I believe:</p><ul><li>pacifism: The doctrine that disputes (especially between countries) should be<br>settled without recourse to violence; the active opposition to such<br>violence, especially the refusal to take part in military action</li><li>pacifist: opposed to war</li><li>pacifist: one who loves, supports, or favors peace; one who is pro-peace</li><li>pacifist: An individual who disagrees with war on principle</li></ul><p>Some definitions of pacifism specify opposition to all violence, even in self-defense, but these strike me as too broad.&nbsp; I\u2019m a pacifist not because I <i>oppose </i>self-defense, but because it\u2019s virtually impossible to fight a war of self-defense.&nbsp; Even if militaries don\u2019t deliberately target innocent bystanders, they almost always wind up recklessly endangering their lives.&nbsp; If a policeman fought crime the way that \u201ccivilized\u201d armies wage war, we\u2019d put him in jail.</p><p>But isn\u2019t pacifism, in <a href=\"http://www.positiveatheism.org/hist/quotes/homer.htm\"><strong>Homer Simpson\u2019s words</strong></a>, one of those views \u201cwith all the well-meaning rules that don\u2019t work in real life\u201d?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Here\u2019s my common-sense case for pacifism:</p><p>1. <i>The immediate costs of war are clearly awful.</i>&nbsp; Most wars lead to massive loss of life and wealth on at least one side.&nbsp; If you use a standard value of life of $5M, every 200,000 deaths is equivalent to a <i>trillion</i> dollars of damage.</p><p>2. <i>The long-run benefits of war are highly uncertain.</i>&nbsp; Some wars \u2013 most obviously the Napoleonic Wars and World War II \u2013 at least arguably deserve credit for decades of subsequent peace.&nbsp; But many other wars \u2013 like the French Revolution and World War I \u2013 just sowed the seeds for new and greater horrors.&nbsp; You could say, \u201cFine, let\u2019s only fight wars with big long-run benefits.\u201d&nbsp; In practice, however, it\u2019s very difficult to predict a war\u2019s long-run consequences.&nbsp; One of the great lessons of <a href=\"http://www.econlib.org/archives/2007/12/my_defense_of_e.html\"><strong>Tetlock\u2019s </strong><i><strong>Expert Political Judgment</strong></i></a> is that foreign policy experts are <i>much </i>more certain of their predictions than they have any right to be.</p><p>3. <i>For a war to be morally justified, its long-run benefits have to be <strong>substantially</strong> larger than its short-run costs.</i>&nbsp; I call this \u201cthe principle of mild deontology.\u201d&nbsp; Almost everyone thinks it\u2019s wrong to murder a random person and use his organs to save the lives of five other people.&nbsp; For a war to be morally justified, then, its (innocent lives saved/innocent lives lost) ratio would have to exceed 5:1.&nbsp; (I personally think that a much higher ratio is morally required, but I don\u2019t need that assumption to make my case).</p><p>Are there conceivable circumstances under which I\u2019d break my pacifist principles?&nbsp; Yes; as I explained in <a href=\"http://www.gmu.edu/departments/economics/bcaplan/handeb.htm\"><strong>my debate with Robin Hanson</strong></a>, I oppose \u201cone-sentence moral theories\u201d:</p><blockquote><p>It is absurd to latch on to an abstract grand moral theory, and then defend it against every counter-example.</p></blockquote><p>In the real-world, however, pacifism is a sound guide to action.&nbsp; While I admit that wars occasionally have good overall consequences, it\u2019s very difficult to identify these wars in advance.&nbsp; And unless you\u2019re willing to bite the bullet of involuntary organ donation, \u201cgood overall consequences\u201d are insufficient to morally justify war.&nbsp; If the advocates of a war can\u2019t reasonably claim that they\u2019re saving five times as many innocent lives as they take, they\u2019re in the wrong.</p><p>I suspect that economists\u2019 main objection to pacifism is it actually <i>increases</i> the quantity of war by reducing the cost of aggression.&nbsp; As <a href=\"http://www.econlib.org/archives/2005/04/why_most_econom.html\"><strong>I\u2019ve argued before</strong></a>, though, this is at best a half-truth:</p><blockquote><p>Threats and bullying don\u2019t just <i>move along</i> the \u201cdemand for crossing you\u201d curve. If your targets perceive your behavior as inappropriate, mean, or downright evil, it <i>shifts </i>their \u201cdemand for crossing you\u201d out. Call it psychology, or just common sense: People who previously bore you no ill will now start looking for a chance to give you a taste of your own medicine.</p><p>The upshot for foreign policy is that people who warn about \u201csowing the seeds of hate\u201d are not the simpletons they often seem to be. Military reprisals against, for example, nations that harbor terrorists reduce the quantity of terrorism holding anti-U.S. hatred fixed. But if people in target countries and those who sympathize with them feel the reprisals are unjustified, we are making them angrier and thereby increasing the demand for terrorism. Net effect: <strong>Ambiguous</strong>.</p></blockquote><p>Rebecca West once wrote that, \u201cFeminism is the radical notion that women are people.\u201d&nbsp; Pacifism, similarly, is the radical notion that before you kill innocent people, you should be reasonably sure that your action will have very good consequences.&nbsp; That\u2019s a one-sentence moral theory even I\u2019m comfortable embracing.</p><h1><a href=\"https://www.econlib.org/archives/2011/04/pacifism_defend.html\">Pacifism Defended</a></h1><p>It\u2019s time to reply to my critics.&nbsp; Here goes:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.econlib.org/archives/2011/04/rights_a_licens.html#136593\"><strong>Mike DC writes</strong></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Suppose some jerk burns a Koran, and devout Muslims respond with by killing every American they come across.

The way we did this was that I&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/inpofrDDGJHtJvcyn/consider-splitting-your-fellowships-into-two-parts-to\"><u>split our fellowship into two halves</u></a>, and ran the first 4 sessions within just a week.</p><p>People who are motivated can opt-in for the second half, which I would recommend to be weekly, as running (almost) daily sessions for a week is intensive enough.</p><h1>When to run intensive fellowships, and for whom</h1><p>Before I go into the pros and cons of intensive fellowship, I want to caveat with the following:</p><p>I think the target audience of intensive fellowships should be university students as opposed to professionals, as students have a larger variability in their availability to accommodate a week-long program. The times I would recommend running this fellowship are either 1) a week before the semester starts, 2) during fall/spring break&nbsp; 3) during summer. Your preferred timing will depend on your country and how breaks are allocated during/before the semester, as well as whether they are real breaks, or just \u201cbreaks\u201d during which students are intensively preparing for midterms etc.</p><p><strong>You probably shouldn\u2019t run an intensive fellowship during weeks when students already have classes</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>So far we ran it during summer and a week before the semester started, both worked out fine. By the time of publishing this, I would have also wanted to pilot it during the semester in spring/fall break, but our government keeps canceling these citing energy shortage concerns... So is life.</p><h1><br>Pros</h1><h3>You get to onboard people to ea ideas very quickly</h3><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LaZjDF5uhdCozBBLZ/we-need-alternatives-to-intro-ea-fellowships#Downsides_of_Intro_Fellowships_\"><u>One criticism</u></a> of the current fellowship 8-week fellowship system that most groups use is that it is too slow for people who are really excited and want to move faster. Arguably this way you can get data on how excited someone is about EA much faster, and give them additional support.</p><h3>More signups?</h3><p>There&nbsp;is some<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/inpofrDDGJHtJvcyn/consider-splitting-your-fellowships-into-two-parts-to#1__A_shorter_course_allows_for_more_signups\"><u> anecdotal evidence</u></a> that it might be easier to market a 4-week course compared to an 8-week one.</p><p>My subjective sense was that getting signups for a 4-day intensive fellowship was definitely not harder than doing the same for a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/inpofrDDGJHtJvcyn/consider-splitting-your-fellowships-into-two-parts-to\">4-week fellowship</a>, and it might have been somewhat easier. I\u2019m quite uncertain about this, and based on the data I have I really can\u2019t draw any strong conclusions, as there were just too many confounding factors to compare our marketing efforts for the different programs.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref90unqhy302\"><sup><a href=\"#fn90unqhy302\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>My common-sense argument for why it might be easier to market an intensive fellowship than a weekly one is that it is easier for people to commit for a week of something before university starts when they have fewer things going on compared to afterward.</p><h3>Better attendance?</h3><p>Again, with the caveat that our data is quite limited: my sense is that overall attendance was somewhat better, but it\u2019s also more likely to be a \u201chit or miss\u201d, meaning that if something unexpected comes up for the attendee during course-week, they will be more likely to drop the whole thing, while on the weekly format maybe they would be just just missing a session.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdsfc6y8fpr\"><sup><a href=\"#fndsfc6y8fpr\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><h3>Costs</h3><p>While not cheaper then weekly fellowships, I thought it's worth flagging that they are much cheaper than running a retreat, which so far has been a more common alternative to weekly fellowships. (Of course, retreats have a bunch of other advantages, we don't need to go into that here.)</p><h1>Cons</h1><h3>People might need more time to process all the complicated ideas</h3><p>I\u2019m sure this has been said much better elsewhere, but many ideas in EA are weird, and one could argue that it\u2019s better to allow people more time to process them, especially if we want them to eventually act on those ideas. I\u2019m not sure if that offsets the other benefits of intensive fellowships, but my current sense is that at least it\u2019s worth experimenting more with this approach.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefeuf8ue1ruir\"><sup><a href=\"#fneuf8ue1ruir\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><h3>It\u2019s draining on community builders and participants</h3><p>Intensive fellowships are intensive indeed, as you are packing all the sessions in a week, which would otherwise take a month.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are going to be the coordinator for the fellowship, you should expect to be pretty busy during the week of the fellowship. If there are facilitators in your group who are not students, you will likely also be able to rely on them less during an intensive fellowship, as people with day jobs can likely give weekly ~2 hours of their time for weeks much easier than 8 hours of their time in just one week. Of course, you should ask people well in advance to see if they can help out some more during the course week.</p><p>As for participants, it is pretty draining as well, especially if they have to prepare for the sessions at home, as opposed to having in-session readings (as how some AIS groups are doing it, including us). To mitigate this, you may want to use a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/editPost?postId=Ejb723bcwgbxMqES3&amp;key=b33f73a512d86382e4784729f76ba3\">\u201czero homework\u201d version of the Intro to EA fellowship</a>, however, you should be mindful of the drawbacks it has.</p><h3>Things can slip away more easily</h3><p>Given that sessions are happening faster, it is more consequential if someone misses a session, as they won\u2019t have a week to catch up with the materials. Their lag on the readings can build up more the next day. To mitigate for this, (especially if you are doing at-home readings), I recommend having Wednesday as a break and having a last session on Friday instead of blitzing out the 4 sessions between Monday and Thursday. This way people can take a breath in between and catch up with the readings if they have to.<br>If you are the coordinator, you should make sure to ask the facilitators to closely track who is attending and missing sessions, so you can step in to help if needed. The way we do this is by reminding facilitators to fill out&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/13qBeFbsAjToqgF96ynK6ByKVUmXnKrfIC6jyYWx45k0/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>this</u></a> reflection form after every session, feel free to copy it if you want to.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Overall, this is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/rsq98ZnMAjfrYFwtq\"><u>one of the experiments</u></a> we ran that I\u2019m most excited about, and will likely continue doing some version of it.

This project will be my PhD thesis. However, I still have 3 years of the PhD to go, so a substantial amount of my opinions on the matter are subject to changes.</p><p><i>Disclaimer:</i> I have received some funding as a Forethought Foundation Fellow in support of my PhD research.

Hopefully it will help them to save time by separating the wheat from the chaff, the good research articles and books from the minor contributions. Initially, I had my reservations about doing a Bibliography Review, since now we have GPT4 which is quite good at purely neutral descriptive summarizing, so I felt maybe perhaps this work wasn't needed. However, given that now we have it as a good research assistant for pure facts, that also allows me more freedom to be more opinionated in my bibliography review. I'll try to tell you what I think is super worth reading, and what is \"meh, skim it if you have free time\", so you can sift through the literature in a more time-efficient way.</p><p>The eventual goal outcome of the whole project would be to distil the main insights into book on the topic of Moral Progress with serious contributions to the current literature within interdisciplinary moral philosophy, but that probably won't happen until I finish my PhD thesis manuscript around 2026. Then after that, I'll have to rewrite that manuscript to turn it into a more accessible book, so it probably wouldn't be published until a later date. &nbsp;I'm also not sure just yet whether it would be an academic book on a University Press or something closer to <i>What We Owe The Future,</i> which aims to be accessible for a broader audience.</p><p>So the finished work is quite a long way. On the brighter side, I will publish some of the key findings and takeaways on the EA Forum, probably in summarized form rather than the excruciatingly slow pace of writing in philosophy, which often takes 20 pages to make some minor points. Instead of that, I guess I'll post something closer to digestible bullet points with my views, attempting to foster online discussion, and then defend them in more detail over time and in the eventual book.</p><p>Your feedback will of course be appreciated, particularly if I change my mind on substantial issues, connect me with other researchers, etc. So let's put our collective brain together (<i>this is a pun having to do with cultural evolution that you might not understand yet...</i>) and make it the best version it can be. You might even appear in the acknowledgments of the thesis/book, eventually! :)</p><h1>Guiding Questions.</h1><p>What is the point of researching moral progress? Let's break that down into smaller questions. My work aims to answer the following questions. Even if the answers end up being partial, I hope I can illuminate several of them:</p><ul><li><strong>What is moral progress?</strong> and related conceptual questions.<ul><li>I'm not looking so much for the \"correct definition\", which I think is trivial and mostly uninformative. Moral progress is \"when a state of affairs improves, morally speaking\". That's pretty much what there is to say about the right definition, which is correct but not very interesting or informative.</li><li>Rather, I aim to be informative. To illuminate what I mean, let's borrow from a similar case. John Rawls distinguished<i> the concept of justice</i> from <i>a conception of justice</i>. The concept (or definition?) of justice is something like: <a href=\"https://iep.utm.edu/justwest/\">\"being given what we are owed, giving people what is their due\" (Plato/Aristotle)</a>. Meanwhile, a conception of justice is the particular substantive theory that Rawls put forward in <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Theory_of_Justice\">A Theory of Justice, with his veil of ignorance, original position</a>, etcetera. &nbsp;So in conclusion, we need a conception of moral progress, not an analysis of the concept of moral progress.</li></ul></li><li>How does progress <strong>fit as a subset of normative moral </strong>and political philosophy?<ul><li>There are some subtleties regarding whether a theory of moral progress is compatible with moral anti-realism. I and other authors working on the topic would like to claim that it is. My key guiding principle here is to not be eliminativist. That is, I want to say that moral progress is an interesting idea or subject of inquiry without collapsing it, eliminating it, or reducing it to \"just find moral truths and follow them\".</li><li>The contributions to the topic of moral progress shouldn't aim to just attempt to recreate moral philosophy, with its typical moral dilemmas and thought experiments like its trolley problems, experience machine, non-identity problem, etc. Ideally, we would want to sidestep that discussion.</li></ul></li><li>Can we create a <strong>plausible substantive normative conception</strong> of moral/social progress?<ul><li>I think we can, and this is the philosophical core of my project, and my focus for this and next year. I think I have the basic idea, but there's a lot of theoretical refinement left to be done. So sadly, this part is not ready yet.</li><li>I don't think any authors have put forward any normative conception in the way that I aim at doing. Authors until now have mostly focused on Singer's idea of the expanding circle of moral consideration, an idea that is limiting (towards the phenomenon of moral inclusion) compared to the entire field of moral progress, which seems to me much broader.</li></ul></li></ul><p>That's on the conceptual or philosophical side. My project has a second part, which is more interdisciplinary and closer to social science.</p><ul><li>Can we <strong>predict</strong> moral progress, <strong>speed it up, and/or secure it, at least in broad strokes</strong>?<ul><li>This is a core aim of many of the books and articles on moral progress, although I believe they mostly fail at doing so. I have different approach that I hope will be more illuminating here.</li></ul></li><li>Can a broad theory of moral progress help us <strong>find points of intercultural/universal overlapping consensus?</strong> Could such a theory help us secure human rights, duties, etc.? Can it avoid hegemonism/imperialism and even integrate the standpoint perspective of marginalized groups (perspective of black people, women, global south, avoid ageism, avoid ableism, etc.)?<ul><li>My hope is that it can, but I won't be sure until the project is closer to completion.</li><li>In addition, it's very important to always keep in mind that finding what moral progress is doesn't mean enforcing it to other cultures. That is a further question that requires much further moral and political discussion and particular expertise of the situation.</li></ul></li><li>Can a metric of moral progress be used by social science fields? Or <strong>deployed to study societies</strong>?<ul><li>My initial thought is that perhaps different indicators such as GDP, Gini, Democracy Index, Peace Index, etc. can be combined into a single metric of wide, collective social progress.</li><li>The issue with this approach is that it probably cannot make judgements about progress without making strong judgement calls about value tradeoffs (how to trade off GDP vs inequality, or a point in the Democracy Index vs a point in the Peace Index, etcetera.) in order to put them on a common scale.</li></ul></li></ul><h1>Who has a good Personal Fit for becoming a Moral Progress researcher?</h1><p><i>(This is me justifying that I'm a good fit for this project and that I'm not wasting my time by researching this rather than doing something else. I think it has some insights of who's a good fit for this particular topic of research, but if you don't care, just skip this section.)</i></p><p>Since this is the EA Forum and I've been in touch with EA ideas and the community for years, I know that we worry a lot about the Importance, Tractability, Neglectedness heuristic and about personal fit within a research topic. So I often ask myself: \"Is my time better spent working on conceptual and empirical issues regarding this thing called \"moral progress\", or should I instead research something else in moral philosophy that seems more Global Priorities Research-approved, like population ethics? Should I be in academia at all, or should I go work on policy or an EA organization?\"</p><p>In fact, one of my takeaways is that <i>research on moral progress (and the broad concept of progress in general) is not very time-efficient, due to both empirical and conceptual complexity</i>, so I feel I have to defend the fact that I'm researching this topic rather than something else. Okay, here's an attempt, which is imperfect but better than nothing.</p><ol><li><strong>My interdisciplinary interest and approach to philosophy.</strong> I like doing what philosopher Eric Schleisser (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10539-019-9673-3\">2019</a>) calls Synthetic Philosophy. Here's a <a href=\"https://dailynous.com/2023/05/30/a-plea-for-synthetic-philosophy-guest-post/\">summary</a>. To brutally simplify it, it means that I find theories that bring insights about big questions of human nature interesting. Schleisser mentions Daniel Dennett and Peter Godfrey-Smith as good examples of synthetic philosophers. I'd add <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hedgehog_and_the_Fox\">hedgehogs</a> in Isaiah Berlin's sense. I have a propensity for theories of everything, a theory of the social world, and/or a theory of progress. A system with coherent metaethics, normative philosophy, etc. that makes internal coherent sense. On the other hand, I find narrow philosophical puzzles boring (e.g. Newcomb's Paradox, the Sleeping Beauty Problem, the Non-Identity Problem). I'm also bad at them, skeptical of our capabilities to solve them (see e.g. Machery <a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/lsereviewofbooks/2017/10/26/book-review-philosophy-within-its-proper-bounds-by-edouard-machery/\">2017</a>), and skeptical of their practical usefulness.</li><li><strong>I have previous experience with similar topics. </strong>My main areas in philosophy since undergrad have been Moral Epistemology (stuff about methodology and intuitions, how do we have moral knowledge?), Metaethics (the debate between moral realism, anti-realism, constructivism, and what is a true statement in ethics, semantically and metaphysically?), and Moral Psychology (stuff like Jonathan Haidt, evolutionary psychology, developmental psychology. Can we trust moral intuitions? In what situations? Do evolutionary predispositions, or even cultural influences prove that our moral beliefs are biased and thus unreliable?). For more details on my research interests, see <a href=\"https://www.rafaelruizdelira.com/\">my personal website</a>.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>I'm actually not that good at writing normative moral philosophy</strong>, because I'm a boring utilitarian with not much to add to the discussion (Bentham figured it out, folks!). Sadly they don't let me publish papers that are three lines long saying \"well, actually the total utilitarian position is right rather than these more complicated positions\", whether they are correct or not, so lots of normative moral philosophy is not for me.</li><li><strong>Luckily, the topic intersects with some of the key areas within EA, particularly having to do with </strong><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/historian-of-societal-trends/\"><strong>value change and social institutions</strong></a><strong>. </strong>It is not a \"core\" priority area (like top 10), but it's a \"second-class one\" (like top 30). Which hopefully means the work could be socially impactful in terms of takeaways for policy recommendations and for longtermism. The idea is that there's at least some low probability that there can be policy takeaways and insights learned from this research that can improve our institutions (governments, social movements, invisible hand mechanisms, etc.), which could create enormous benefits for the long-term future. That's my belief, anyway. In fact, <i>What We Owe the Future</i> ended up arguing points that I aim to pick up, so hopefully I'm not so off-track.</li><li>I feel <strong>my personal life experiences make me more wary of extrapolating local cultural stuff to universal</strong>. I've lived half my life in Europe, and the other half in Latin America. That doesn't prove anything by itself, but I feel it has given me a bit of a multicultural perspective regarding the universality (or lack thereof) of moral codes and judgements.</li><li>In terms of <strong>university environment and departmental fit</strong>, I'd say the London School of Economics is an extremely good environment for my kind of interdisciplinary research. Interdisciplinary philosophy connected to social science is a strength of the department and of the university.</li><li><strong>Extrinsic motivation and social interest.</strong> Most people find the topic of moral progress, social progress, social movements, etc. to either be fascinating and it leads to an interesting discussion, or it leads to the knee-jerk response that the world is obviously getting worse and to an interesting discussion anyway. Everybody has opinions on progress. This gives me motivation to keep going, which is nice given the high rate of <a href=\"https://www.palatinate.org.uk/one-in-four-phd-students-drop-out/\">academic burnout</a>.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>The topic of moral progress is still surprisingly neglected and underexplored.</strong> Consider an analogy: moral progress is to moral philosophy what growth is to economics. (Probably not a perfect analogy, but good enough). How many books have been written on moral progress? Like 10, tops, most of them in the past 5 years, and I go over most of them in the bibliography review below. How many books, and man-hours have been spent in economics on economic growth? Innumerable. So yeah, I'd say it's a neglected topic, by comparison.</li><li>As mentioned, <strong>the topic of moral progress has been revived in the past five years.</strong> There are reading groups and conferences on the topic and surrounding topics. It's also a perfect time to make contributions to the literature and shape the discussion before it ossifies.</li><li><strong>Sunk cost fallacy or expertise?</strong> At this point, I've spent several years researching and thinking about this topic and had hundreds of conversations on it. I must have read more than 15,000 pages on it or topics related to it. So for better or worse, I might have become \"one of the leading experts\" within this niche area of interdisciplinary moral philosophy.</li></ol><p>This list ended up being a nifty decalogue, which makes my aesthetic sensibilities happy. :)</p><h1><strong>Bibliography Review.</strong></h1><p>Alright, let's dive into it. I will divide it into three bibliographies: (1) Books, (2) Articles, and (3) Works by EAs.&nbsp;</p><p>I will also rank the bibliography by how good it is. &nbsp;So the earlier titles are better than the latter ones (even within the same number of stars, though that's based mostly on \"vibes\", because they cover very different topics).</p><h1>TL;DR / Recommended Reading Order.</h1><p>\"I'm new to the topic of moral progress.

Moral Progress: Recent Developments (2021)</a>.</p><h2>Amazing books (5/5 \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 - Read them and take notes)</h2><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/38388738-the-evolution-of-moral-progress\"><strong>Allen Buchanan and Rachel Powell - The Evolution of Moral Progress: A Biocultural Theory (2018)</strong></a><strong> - Genre: Moral Philosophy - No Audiobook</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong> This is the current \"classic\" or reference book on the debate around moral progress. Everyone working on the topic cites it. I believe it easily supersedes Singer's Expanding Circle book on the topic. While it is long and a bit slow-paced, I think it's the classic for a good reason and most pages have a worthwhile insight. Unavoidable if you care about this debate. It draws a lot from their previous articles, so if you want to cut to the chase, maybe read their articles (<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/682188\">2015</a>) and (<a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/BUCTAN-5\">2016</a>).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> I believe the book has two big flaws, both of which have to do with how they constrain the topic. One is that they only focus on the expanding circle or inclusivism. As I aim to show in my own work, moral circle expansion is one of many mechanisms that fall into the label moral progress, not the whole story. <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/135683054-moral-teleology\">Hanno Sauer (2022)</a> argues the same, successfully I believe. The other issue is that they solely or mostly focus on psychological mechanisms, particularly those relating to ingroup-outgroup empathy, while neglecting social or sociological mechanisms such as laws, customs, and the welfare state. As pointed out by Hanno Sauer in his (<a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/SAUBBM\">2019</a>) article, also found in his book <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/135683054-moral-teleology\">Moral Teleology (2022, Ch. 2)</a>, this is problematic. It already concedes the terms of the debate to the \"bioconservative\" a position sometimes represented by people who think human beings are essentially nepotistic and not very malleable by culture, and argue that our empathy is limited and that we cannot be morally universalist in a strong sense. This position is sometimes attributed to Steven Pinker, Jonathan Haidt, Joshua Greene, Francis Fukuyama, or Eric Posner.</p><p>As a result of these constraints or flaws, they don't develop a general theory of moral progress. Instead, they develop a mostly biological and psychological approach to the expanding circle (inclusivism). It's not the whole story of moral progress, and while it tries to bring in culture to defend their position, I'd argue that their position is still too biological and not cultural enough. Still, a worthwhile read.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13543093-the-better-angels-of-our-nature\"><strong>Steven Pinker - The Better Angels of Our Nature. The Decline of Violence in History and Its Causes (2011)</strong></a><strong> - Genre: Historical Trends - Audiobook Available</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong> I expected this work to be quite bad, since it has been quite widely criticized. But I was very pleasantly surprised. The case that Pinker makes is more nuanced than critics admit. In fact, he's critical of many things in the history of humanity, and admits of our flaws. It is less \"clearly triumphalist\" than its critics say. I believe Pinker is roughly correct in his broad picture of how violence might have declined by one or two orders of magnitude since we became nation-states. But his argument is not just about the nation-state, but about other processes as well such as gentle commerce and globalization, feminization (violence/machismo reduction), literacy, etc. Check out the summary of the book on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Better_Angels_of_Our_Nature\">Wikipedia</a>. Also, it's a very famous book, so it ends up being unavoidable.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> The book goes back and forth between data and anecdotal evidence or quotes from important historical figures, which makes me feel a bit uneasy from cherry-picking. But that also makes the book more readable because it's less boring.</p><p>However, as a result of everything, it is very long (800 pages!), so my first readthrough was using the audiobook. I'll go to the PDF for my actual writing phase.</p><p>There are articles written against it. I haven't yet read them, but there's this entire book that argues against Pinker, it's called <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54968256-darker-angels-of-our-nature-the\">\"The Darker Angels of our Nature: Refuting the Pinker Theory of History and Violence\", edited by Philip Dwyer and Mark Micale (2021)</a>. There's also a criticism of the statistics by <a href=\"https://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/pinker.pdf\">Nassim Taleb</a>. And about the narrative of old societies being extremely violent by<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/12748/chapter-abstract/162857545?redirectedFrom=fulltext\"> Brian Ferguson</a>. My opinion of Pinker's book might change after reading them.</p><p>Another issue is that it doesn't talk at all about our massive violence inflicted on animals through factory farming. It also doesn't talk about how catastrophic or existential risks (global nuclear war, climate change, AI risk...) can endanger his narrative about progress and violence. These caveats are important to keep in mind. <i>(Thanks to @GhostCoase on Twitter for highlighting some of these flaws of Pinker's book.)</i></p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/135683054-moral-teleology\"><strong>Hanno Sauer - Moral Teleology: A Theory of Progress (2023)</strong></a><strong> - Genre: Moral Philosophy - No Audiobook</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Hanno Sauer is correct in pretty much all the points in which he deviates from Buchanan and Powell, Peter Singer, and Kumar and Campbell. His main claims is that Moral Progress is not mainly inclusivist, not limited to moral circle expansion. I came to the same conclusions independently, so I believe we're on the right track. Very underrated book.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> I don't love the way it's written. Maybe it's personal preference, but I found it hard to read and a bit all over the place. I think it could have been organized better. Still, a super important reading. Out of all the authors, my own conception of Moral Progress shares the most with Sauer's. We independently came to similar points.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58502650-the-journey-of-humanity\"><strong>Oded Galor - The Journey of Humanity (2020)</strong></a><strong> - Genre: Historical Trends - Audiobook Available</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong> I was introduced to this book at the <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lVndj-xzmxk\">10th Oxford Workshop for Global Priorities Research in a talk by the author himself</a>. I was very impressed by the talk, and bought the book the next day. I was also very impressed by the book.&nbsp;In a relatively slim book, Galor presents a good overview of how technology has made humans get out of the Malthusian \"subsistence trap\". If you only want to read one book on the topic of technology and the broad picture of humanity, I think this one is a good pick.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> None that immediately come to mind. Could be more detailed, but it would be longer. I thought it was very solid, even if it's not the most groundbreaking. But I'm no economist. Economists might be able to find more flaws.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25761655-the-secret-of-our-success\"><strong>Joseph Henrich's - The Secret of Our Success (2016)</strong></a><strong> - Genre: Cultural Evolution, Pre-History - Audiobook Available</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Masterful work on how humans transmit, learn, and accumulate information over time, which is what made humans successful, rather than intelligence alone (imagine having to reinvent fire or the wheel by yourself everytime!). Basically, humanity can be visualized as a big networked brain, and stuff like cultural globalization that communicates faster and faster keeps making us smarter, both individually and collectively. A good primer on cultural evolution.</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Ironically, I am quite confused about what \"cultural evolution\" exactly is under Henrich's conception. Some stuff he mentions seems like a very straightforward \"transmission of culture or information\", without any evolutionary component. He uses the term very liberally.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51710349-the-weirdest-people-in-the-world\"><strong>Joseph Henrich - The WEIRDest People in the World: How the West Became Psychologically Peculiar and Particularly Prosperous (2020)</strong></a><strong> - Genre: Cultural Evolution, Historical Trends since the 1300s - Audiobook Available</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong> After the 2010 article also named \"The WEIRDest People in the World\" took the psychology world by storm, claiming that findings in American undergraduates don't replicate across other non-urban non-western societies due to different cultures and socioeconomic backgrounds, I long awaited this book. I am very impressed by the end result, but it is extremely long. (As a result, I've only listened to the audiobook. It took me several months to go through it. I still fondly remember going on long walks near my house during the Covid-19 pandemic while listening to this!)</p><p>Henrich pulls off a massive interdisciplinary range to answer a simple question: \"why did modernization happen, and why did it happen in Europe?\" Like a good cultural evolutionist (he basically says it's a sequel to <i>The Secret of Our Sucess</i>), he's going to claim it was a change in culture.&nbsp;</p><p>Henrich follows in the footsteps of Max Weber's \"The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism\". To simplify, Weber thought that religion, particularly Calvinism, led to a strong focus on work, because if your business was successful, it was confirmation that you were among the predestined ones by God to attain salvation. This change in culture brought capitalism, particularly in the United States, which had lots of Calvinists. Henrich wants to do something similar to Weber. I really liked discussions about the role of religion and big moralizing gods.&nbsp;</p><p>There's also a substantial part about how markets promote impartial moral views. For example, there's stuff about how different cultures react to ultimatum games. Apparently, cultures that are better integrated with markets, like Americans or Europeans, are more egalitarian when distributing money. Cultures that don't deal in big impersonal markets as often, like the indigenous communities of Peru, will accept much lower amounts in ultimatum games (adjusted for purchasing parity). This purportedly means that markets lead to higher moral universalism. This contradicts the claim that markets make people greedy or self-centred, which might be surprising to many leftists.</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Henrich's main emphasis is... weird (no pun intended!). He puts a really big emphasis on the fact that the church prohibited incest led to modernization. Step by step, this breaks down into: incest prohibitions led to families having to mix more, which led to greater social mobility, which led to greater development of markets, which led to greater moral impartiality and universalism. While I think incest prohibitions plausibly played a role, I'm skeptical that it was the main driver behind modernity. So I think he overemphasizes this core claim. Still, a great book with many insights.</p><h2>Great books (4/5 \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 - Read them)</h2><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58986891-a-better-ape\"><strong>Victor Kumar and Richmond Campbell - A Better Ape: The Evolution of the Moral Mind and How it Made Us Human (2022)</strong></a><strong> - Genre: Moral Psychology, Moral Philosophy - Audiobook Available</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Like Sauer, brings in some cultural evolution to the debate on moral progress.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> In general, I found the book a bit shallow. Each of the three big sections could have been a standalone book. As a result, it doesn't reach the heights of Frans de Waal or Sterelny on apes, of Henrich on cultural evolution, or of Buchanan and Powell or Hanno Sauer on moral progress. It's nice if you want a broad overview, bad if you want depth.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57630862-moral-progress\"><strong>Philip Kitcher - Moral Progress (2021)</strong></a><strong> - Genre: Moral Philosophy, Social Movements - No Audiobook</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong> It's a series of talks compiled into a book, so it's readable. It's also not too long (200 pages). He argues for a pragmatist-constructivist-proceduralist version of moral progress, which to me seems the right move. The idea is to argue that we don't need to find final moral truth out there (called \"The Discovery View\" by Kitcher), but rather, the process of moral inquiry for moral circle expansion proceeds by including people who used to be ignored due to dominant ideologies and altruism failures in the moral dialogue. In this way, moral progress is more like the headlights of a car. We can see a bit further, even if we can't see the final destination. Good move in order to talk about moral improvements even if you're a moral anti-realist (which means that you don't believe in mind-independent, \"platonic\" moral truths).</p><p>Philip Kitcher is also a great philosopher of science, so he knows what he's talking about when criticizing the Discovery View and proposing an alternative methodology for ethics. (On the science part, his book <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/325864.The_Advancement_of_Science\">The Advancement of Science</a> is still an important reference, and the way I discovered him in undergrad).</p><p>Furthermore, if you enjoy it and want to read more Kitcher, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12974522-the-ethical-project\">The Ethical Project (2011)</a> is also a great book that expands on this one. He also has work on philosophical pragmatism inspired by Dewey, and the relationship between science and democracy.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Only talks about the paradigmatic cases of the abolition of slavery, women's suffrage, and LGBT rights. Plays it safe and covers an already treaded area by this point (done better by Buchanan and Powell 2018).&nbsp;</p><p>But more importantly, this is moral circle expansion or moral inclusion, rather than the entire broader phenomenon of moral progress. He's still trapped in the Peter Singer / Buchanan and Powell framework of empathy and psychological processes, rather than social changes. All the commentators (Rahel Jaeggi, Susan Neiman, and Amia Srinivasan, all of whom are great philosophers in their own right) push him on this, but he doesn't offer a very compelling answer. So read Hanno Sauer (<a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/SAUBBM\">his article 2021</a> or <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/135683054-moral-teleology\">his book 2022</a>) after this for the way out of this framework.</p><p>Still, worth reading for the criticism of the \"Discovery View\" of ethics, his alternative proposal of a pragmatist-constructivist-proceduralist approach, and his talk about \"altruism failures\" and \"dominant ideologies that lead to false consciousness\".</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34890015-factfulness\"><strong>Hans Rosling - Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About the World and Why Things Are Better Than You Think (2018)</strong></a><strong> - Genre: Post-Industrial Historical Trends. - Audiobook Available</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>If you ever wanted the website <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/\">Our World in Data</a> (well, actually <a href=\"https://www.gapminder.org/\">Gapminder</a>) in book form, here it is, basically. Good extension of Steven Pinker's Better Angels and Enlightenment Now. &nbsp;It also outlines the cognitive biases we suffer from that make us so pessimistic about the state of the world. &nbsp;Really good at shattering myths and misconceptions for people who might think that the world has got economically, socially, or morally worse.</p><p>Also, he has many <a href=\"https://www.ted.com/playlists/474/the_best_hans_rosling_talks_yo\">TED Talks summarizing his research in entertaining ways.</a></p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Not technically about progress in the moral sense, but changes in material conditions, so I can't rate it higher. But it's a really good book to convince pessimist that the world is improving.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39217056-becoming-human\"><strong>Michael Tomasello - Becoming Human: A Theory of Ontogeny (2018)</strong></a><strong>- Genre: Cognitive Human Development - No Audiobook</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Tomasello theorizes about how humans develop morality, internalize moral rules, etc. particularly between 9 months and 5 years of age. He draws insights from Lev Vygotsky and Lawrence Kohlberg, combined with his own experiments. It's really enlightening if you care about how humans learn norms and behaviors, developing joint collective intentionality through cognitive revolutions that take place in these years. It highlights ways in which humans are different from other mammals in terms of structured norms of morality. For a summary, I particularly recommend the last chapter where he compares his theory with Vygotsky and Kohlberg.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Not directly relevant to the topic of progress.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57303239-biograf-a-de-la-inhumanidad\"><strong>Jose Antonio Marina - Biography of Inhumanity (2021)</strong></a><strong> - Genre: Moral Values, Cultural Evolution - Audiobook in Spanish only</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Mixes cultural evolution with good observations about dehumanization of others and human history. Learnt a lot from it.</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Sadly I believe the book is only available in Spanish. Which is too bad because I think it's really good.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13253672-the-evolved-apprentice?\"><strong>Kim Sterelny's - The Evolved Apprentice: How Evolution Made Humans Unique (2009)</strong></a><strong> - Genre: Human Pre-History - Audiobook Available</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Solid overview work on the Pleistocene era humans. Takes the framework outlined by Joseph Henrich and other cultural evolutionists (with minor disagreements), and combines it with archeological evidence to provide a compelling picture. Lots of discussion about how events like collaborative hunting, the discovery of fire, etc. led to human development and cooperation.</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Sterelny is a philosopher, not a scientist. As a result, he doesn't really put any evidence into question, he mostly focuses on sketching a broad picture from other narrow papers that have been written on Pleistocene humans. Checking the bibliography might be good if you're an anthropologist or archaeologist.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11324722-the-righteous-mind\"><strong>Jonathan Haidt - The Righteous Mind (2011)</strong></a><strong> - Genre: Political Psychology - Audiobook Available</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Insightful picture of how, to link it with Henrich, most pre-industrial societies and rural areas have stronger links to the values of sanctity, honor, and authority. Meanwhile, urban liberals have lost their sensitivity to these values. At the very least, I think everybody should check a summary of his <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_foundations_theory\">Moral Foundations Theory</a>. Even if some evidence has been put into question, it's well worth reading to understand another dimension of politics. At the very least, it provides a useful framework to think about and use.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> I got the impression that Haidt carelessly slides from empirical observations to normative recommendations. I read this several years ago, but pulling from memory, in the first chapters he basically goes from how his experience of sexism in India was, to how, eventually, he came to enjoy this sort of casual sexism and hierarchical structure.</p><p>What, exactly, is the lesson here? Towards the end of the book, Haidt seems to want to say that liberals should get closer to conservatives by understanding or recovering these Moral Foundations of sanctity, honor, and authority.&nbsp;</p><p>But we could make the opposite case that conservatives should aim to lose theirs! So the book is worth reading, but read Sauer's (<a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/SAUCWA\">2015</a>) criticism along these lines for a palate cleanser.</p><h2>Okay books (3/5 \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 - Skim them)</h2><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11417583-the-expanding-circle\"><strong>Peter Singer - The Expanding Circle: Ethics and Sociobiology (1979 [2011])</strong></a><strong> - Genre: Moral Philosophy - No Audiobook</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Basically revived the debate on moral progress, which I'd say had mostly been dead since the World Wars (to my knowledge). The metaphor of the expanding circle is beautiful and often useful.&nbsp;</p><p>Core insights such as the fact that we are biological beings doesn't mean we are blind slaves to our biology still stand, and are somewhat updated by Buchanan and Powell.&nbsp;</p><p>If you read it, make sure to read the 2011 version, just because it's a bit updated and has a nice new prologue.</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>You might be surprised that this is so far down! Well, I think the book has some big issues. Some of the sociobiology stuff is... well, quite outdated now. We now have an entire field of evolutionary psychology that has generally superseded sociobiology.&nbsp;</p><p>And perhaps the biggest negative is that, surprisingly, most of the book is NOT about the expanding circle or moral progress at all. It is primarily a philosophical examination of E. O. Wilson's sociobiology. If you want a refined discussion of moral circle expansion, read Buchanan and Powell instead, which I believe has superseded this book.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/192412.Primates_and_Philosophers\"><strong>Frans de Waal - Primates and Philosophers: How Morality Evolved (2006) </strong></a><strong>- Genre: Ape Proto-Morality - No Audiobook</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Brief discussion between a leading primatologist and leading philosophers as Peter Singer, Christine Korsgaard, Philip Kitcher, and journalist Robert Wright. Attempts to refute what he calls the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veneer_theory\">veneer theory of human nature</a>, a view espoused by Thomas Hobbes and Thomas Huxley which basically says we are apes with a thin cultural coat of paint.</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>I read it a long time ago, but I felt it was a bit introductory and not very detailed. Might have to skim it again at some point though.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9526993-nonzero\"><strong>Robert Wright - Nonzero: The Logic of Human Destiny (2000)</strong></a><strong> - Genre: Cultural Evolution - Audiobook Available</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong> I broadly agree with the key premise that society has broadly improved due to in great part due to cultural evolution (or memetics, if you're a fan of Dawkins and Dennett). Our interconnected world has created a metaphorical interconnected giant brain, where each of us is a neuron. There more information is connected, the faster we develop new technologies, skills, and social arrangements.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Robert Wright is a journalist, not a scientist. This makes me prima facie a bit more skeptical of his claims. The sweeping claims at the end of the book are quite bad, and I recommend skipping the last couple of chapters. The rest is mostly fine.&nbsp;</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17707599-moral-tribes?\"><strong>Joshua Greene - Moral Tribes. Emotion, Reason, and the gap between Us and Them (2013)</strong></a><strong> - Genre: Moral Psychology - Audiobook Available</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong> I'm gonna be controversial and, mixed with my other knowledge of moral psychology, say that <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/SINEAI-4\">Greene and Singer</a> are broadly correct that many deontological judgments are gut reactions, panic reactions from the amygdala of \"don't kill!\", \"don't push!\", \"don't punch!\" while utilitarian calculations are more rational. But I might be biased because I like utilitarianism.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>I actually enjoyed this book quite a bit, but it's not the most relevant for moral progress, so I cannot rate it higher.</p><p>Also, the relevance of neuroscience to his overall argument has been questioned, particularly by Selim Berker's (<a href=\"https://philarchive.org/rec/BERTNI\">2009</a>) article. I believe Berker can be replied to, but he does point in the direction that a lot of the neuroscience is not central to the argument.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11106683-on-what-matters\"><strong>Derek Parfit - On What Matters (2011)</strong></a><strong> (just the section on the Triple Theory) - Genre: Moral Philosophy - No Audiobook</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Cool idea. What if a version of rule utilitarianism, a version of Scanlon's contractualism, and a version of Kantianism were all true?</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Bad execution, I believe, and many moral philosophers seem to agree (e.g. Simon Blackburn and many of the <a href=\"https://ndpr.nd.edu/reviews/on-what-matters-volumes-1-and-2/\">other reviews</a> of the book you can find online).<strong> </strong>Kinda unreadable without reading the whole book, to be honest. And \"the whole book\" is several volumes. I only took what I needed from this.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35696171-enlightenment-now\"><strong>Steven Pinker - Enlightenment Now. The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress (2018)</strong></a><strong> - Genre: Social Values / Enlightenment Values - Audiobook Available</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong> While the subtitle mentions reason, science and humanism, about 3/4ths of the book is on progress. Again, I think Pinker is mostly correct in broad strokes. A good read.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> I consider it inferior to <i>The Better Angels of Our Nature</i>. If you've read <i>Better Angels</i>, this is a cherry on top, but feels like a smaller addition. If you haven't, it's a bit odd, because the book is perhaps more accessible than it, but often references and sometimes attempts to defend what was said in <i>Better Angels</i>.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/399136.Imagined_Communities\"><strong>Benedict Anderson - Imagined Communities: Reflections on the Origins and Spread of Nationalism (1983)</strong></a><strong> - Genre: Modernity - No Audiobook</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Outlines how countries are \"Imagined Communities\". They're not fully real yet not fully false. Basically, outlines how technologies such as the printing press and books created the modern state in the 16-17th centuries, which really didn't exist as a community of solidarity before this. Probably a good pairing is McLuhan's <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/440463.The_Gutenberg_Galaxy\"><i>Gutenberg Galaxy</i></a>, which shares the same core theory, and he cites.</p><p>There are cool random nuggets of historical information throughout the book, but while modernization and the rise of the modern state were very important historical events, most of it has nothing <i>particularly</i> having to do with progress by itself.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> It's a rather messy and uneven book with random facts. It feels like a very random collection of essays. I recommend skimming and just taking away from it whatever you want.</p><p>Other authors on the birth of the nation-state have other opinions. Check out <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modernization_theory_(nationalism)\">Ernest Gellner</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethnosymbolism\">Anthony Smith</a> for some other approaches.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49046572-moral-uncertainty\"><strong>William MacAskill, Krister Bykvist, and Toby Ord - Moral Uncertainty (2020)</strong></a><strong> - Genre: Moral Philosophy -</strong> No Audiobook</h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Pretty much the only real book (setting some PhD dissertations aside) on the topic of Moral Uncertainty, which has to do with the question of \"How should agents act if they don't know the right theory, but they have credences distributed across different moral theories?\" It's a great general overviews of the field of moral uncertainty. And basically the required reading if you're getting into that topic for the first time. So it's 5/5 stars if you're interested in that particular topic. Probably the best introductory point for this debate.</p><p>Theories of moral progress often want to be morally uncontroversial, so the idea about finding common ground when you are not sure what moral theory is right can spark interesting ideas.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Not really on progress per-se, so I cannot rate it higher as part of a literature on moral progress.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2068.Darwin_s_Dangerous_Idea?\"><strong>Daniel Dennett - Darwin's Dangerous Idea: Evolution and the Meanings of Life (1995)</strong></a><strong> - Genre: Evolution - Audiobook Available</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Explains how Darwin's theory of evolution is a \"universal acid\" that is hard or impossible to contain, changing our view of humanity in fields usually covered by the humanities irreversibly. Talks a lot about gradualism and memes (in Dawkins sense!), which you might either enjoy or dislike.</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Very broad and long. I find the details hard to recall, but for example the chapter on morality seemed a very superficial first-approach to me, given the massive literature we have now on the relationship between evolution and morality. Spends a lot of the discussion on refuting Stephen Jay Gould, who is an anti-gradualist with regards to evolution.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13689477-unfit-for-the-future?\"><strong>Ingmar Persson and Julian Savulescu - Unfit for the Future: The Need for Moral Enhancement (2012)</strong></a><strong> - Genre: Transhumanism, Human Nature - No Audiobook</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Makes the argument that we need transhumanism to overcome human nature in order to avoid the great dangers of our times, including climate change and existential risks.</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Very slim book and not fully convincing. See the replies on Buchanan and Powell (2018) and by other authors.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/84713.The_Roots_of_Romanticism\"><strong>Isaiah Berlin - The Roots of Romanticism (1965)</strong></a><strong> - Genre: Romantic Values, Nationalism - No Audiobook</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>In this and other books, Berlin outlines the dangers of the romantic movement, framing it as a reactionary, regressive movement against the Enlightenment. Berlin is a great philosopher and I found the book engaging throughout.</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>I think his other book \"<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2976812-freedom-and-its-betrayal\">Freedom and Its Betrayal: Six Enemies of Human Liberty</a>\" might be more politically oriented, rather than analyzing the movement of romanticism as a whole (which includes romanticism in literature and other arts), and thus the better book for this particular topic.</p><h2>Mediocre books (2/5 \u2b50\u2b50 - Skip to the relevant sections)</h2><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8876803-the-honor-code\"><strong>Kwame Anthony Appiah - The Honor Code: How Moral Revolutions Happen (2010)</strong></a><strong> - Genre: Moral Philosophy, Social Movements - Audiobook Available</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong> The chapter on dueling and the one on foot binding were good because I knew next to nothing about these topics. Now I'm a bit more informed. Perhaps skim-read those chapters and skip the rest.</p><p>From those chapters, I particularly liked Appiah's idea of how mockery was used to undermine practices like dueling and foot binding. When a practice becomes embarrassing by peer pressure, the practice can be eliminated within a short period of time. I feel it could be applied to other phenomena such as toxic masculinity or other contemporary moral issues. I'm definitely borrowing that insight.</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>I had great hopes because of the subtitle of the book, but I and other people were left pretty underwhelmed. It's far too anecdotal, full of quotes but lacks data.</p><p>Furthermore, one of Appiah's core claims is that the evil of slavery, foot binding, etc. was obvious all along. That the moral argument was uncontroversial. Something like: \"suffering is bad, so we should stop doing it\". I think this is much less obvious than Appiah claims. As outlined by Jonathan Haidt in The Righteous Mind, most moral codes throughout history have had components such as respect to elders, traditions, and authority figures, which are often respected as the right thing to do, and more important than suffering. So unless those Moral Foundations are weakened, the importance of suffering can be overridden.</p><p>I also think he's wrong about honor having positive moral value, or his section on it failed to convince me. I felt he spent so many chapters bashing cultures of honor, just to defend it at the end in a rushed way. I'm more convinced by Pinker that the process of \"feminization\" or reduction of machismo and violence has been a good thing, and perhaps we could replace honor with a rough equivalent that releases our psychologically abusive tendencies in ways that aren't harmful.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5752.The_Blank_Slate\"><strong>Steven Pinker - The Blank Slate (2000)</strong></a><strong> - Genre: General Psychology - Audiobook Available</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Having taken classes in the Philosophy of Mind and Philosophy of Cognitive Science, I thought that Pinker offers a good introduction to a very broad variety of issues competently enough. It presents stuff like the view of the mind as a computer, with debates like the Language of Thought, connectionism, and human nature. Pinker is more accessible than \"textbooks\" like Tim Crane's \"The Mechanical Mind\", which are more rigorous but technical and harder to read.</p><p>Pinker also presents his opinionated side of things, siding with the evolutionary psychologists John Tooby and Leda Cosmides on analyzing humans as biological animals which inherit a lot of instincts. So he wants to argue that we are instinctually hard-wired towards certain behavior, which explains stuff like our capacity for language.</p><p>It served as a great refresher on some concepts. It's not very related to moral progress, though, so I cannot rate it higher for this purpose.</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>He definitely overextends when he wants to bring his theory of human nature into politics. For example, I seem to remember him arguing against the Soviet Union because human nature cannot make us morally impartial. As people like Buchanan and Powell and people working on culture (e.g. social scientists) have pointed out, moral emotions, beliefs and propensities are quite flexible depending on upbringing, social conditions, social rules, etcetera.</p><p>I take a bit of a middle position between Pinker and the \"leftist that wants to deny human nature\" that he's criticising. I think the evolutionary psychology standpoint is definitely worth taking into consideration, but that point of view might be more straightforward to apply with regards to stuff like language learning, which happens in an individual mind, than to politics and societies, which is less straightforward since there are new phenomena that happens when you're dealing with interactions of large groups of people. I think more recently Pinker would even agree with that, since in his later books like <i>Better Angels</i> and <i>Enlightenment Now</i>, Pinker is a defender of enlightenment values to overcome our \"pre-wired\" tribalism.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36700770-cognitive-gadgets\"><strong>Cecilia Heyes - Cognitive Gadgets: The Cultural Evolution of Thinking (2018)</strong></a><strong> - Genre: Cultural Evolution, Psychology - Audiobook Available</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Seems like a good book for the psychology of cultural evolution, in fact, it might be the only one out there on this intersection.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> I had high expectations for this book, yet I felt that only a couple of chapters towards the middle have actual content? The beginning is a recap of what cultural evolution is, and the end talks about stuff like Chomsky's \"poverty of the stimulus\" argument. And even the core chapters I didn't feel were particularly illuminating.</p><p>Also, um, what the heck is a gadget? I think I got lost or forgot the definition at some point because she kept insisting that \"it's not an instinct, it's a gadget\" like a catchphrase but I felt she never defined it. Anyway, I didn't find it particularly useful for my research so I won't be delving deeper into this direction.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/42068857-how-change-happens\"><strong>Cass Sunstein - How Change Happens (2019)</strong></a><strong> - Genre: Social Change, Policy - Audiobook Available</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Starts off pretty strong in the introduction, but the initial questions get sidelined for most of the book, which he spends talking about nudges.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> My interest really dropped off towards the second half. It's particularly interesting if you want to make successful policy interventions through nudges, but doesn't really answer much about the initial questions outlined in the introduction.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17942017-the-great-escape\"><strong>Angus Deaton - The Great Escape: Health, Wealth, and the Origins of Inequality (2013)</strong></a><strong> - Genre: Trends in Global Poverty, Health - Audiobook Available</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong> There's a lot here from an expert on economics and health.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> I find Amartya Sen (e.g. Development as Freedom) who works in the same framework to be far more interesting.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31694126-progress---ten-reasons-to-look-forward-to-the-future\"><strong>Johan Norberg - Progress: Ten Reasons to Look Forward to the Future (2016)</strong></a><strong> - Genre: Post-Industrial Historical Trends - Audiobook Available</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Solid, similar to Rosling's Factfulness, so a worthy continuation after that.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Not super deep? I barely took notes, which suggests I didn't learn much new beyond Rosling and Pinker. Read Rosling first, it's probably the better book.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52048844-on-inhumanity\">David Livingstone Smith - On Inhumanity: Dehumanization and How to Resist It (2020)</a> - Genre: - Audiobook Available</h3><p><strong>Pros: </strong>Outlines process of regress, from essentialism, to racism, to dehumanization.</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>Honestly, I didn't read this mainly for the PhD project, but a side presentation having to do with violence, conflict and dehumanization. I find Marina's book on inhumanity better, but that one is only available in Spanish. Also, there's a lot of analytic philosophizing in this book that I didn't find particularly helpful or illuminating.</p><h2>Bad books (1/5 \u2b50 - Skip)</h2><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22320454-the-moral-arc\"><strong>Michael Shermer - The Moral Arc: How Science Makes Us Better People (2015) </strong></a><strong>- Genre: Enlightenment Values - Audiobook Available</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Expands a tiny little bit on Pinker's Better Angels by providing more examples and perhaps being more accessible.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Basically everything said in this book is said by Pinker in a much better way. Read Pinker instead and feel free to skip this one.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60277656-making-space-for-justice\"><strong>Michele Moody-Adams - Genre: Social Movements, Moral Philosophy - Making Space for Justice (2023)</strong></a><strong> - Audiobook Available</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong> The book aims to expand on her <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/MICTIO-3\">1999 article on Moral Progress</a>. It brings some nice examples, particularly from recent episodes of racial injustice.</p><p><strong>Cons:</strong> Just read her <a href=\"https://philpapers.org/rec/MICTIO-3\">1999 article</a> instead. Much more succinct and most of the insights are in the original article already.</p><h3><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/58985601-a-brief-history-of-equality\"><strong>Thomas Piketty - A Brief History of Equality (2021) </strong></a><strong>- Genre: Historical Trends - Audiobook Available</strong></h3><p><strong>Pros:</strong> Read the introduction. I thought it was really good.</p><p><strong>Cons: </strong>I don't think the rest of the book was all that great? I didn't get much from the rest. Skip.</p><h1>Article collection.</h1><p>Alright, that's it for books. How about articles?

(2020</strong>) - Probably a good companion and continuation to The Evolution of Moral Progress, written by one of the same authors (the philosopher).</li><li><strong>Cecilie Eriksen - Moral Change: Dynamics, Structure, and Normativity. (2020) </strong>- Seems relevant just by the title alone.</li><li><strong>Jose Antonio Marina - Biography of Humanity (2018). </strong>I've found his Biography of Inhumanity to be insightful, and I expect the same from this one.</li><li><strong>Jeff Sebo - The Moral Circle (to be published soon, 2024?). </strong>I talked to Jeff Sebo at a GPI conference and then read his article on \"Moral Circle Explosion\", which was solid, this seems like a further development on that.</li><li><strong>Robert Baker - The Structure of Moral Revolutions (2019). </strong>I've read a review of this book and it sounded really good.</li><li><strong>Elizabeth Anderson - The Imperative of Integration (2010).</strong> <i>(Thanks to Victor Kumar for reminding me of this book!)</i></li><li><strong>Amy Allen - The End of Progress: Decolonizing the Normative Foundations of Critical Theory (2016).</strong> Will probably skim it and then decide. The way I heard it promoted is as making Critical Theory go from its Habermas and Axel Honneth phase, which revived aspects from Kant and Hegel, respectively, into its revival of Foucault and other French thinkers.</li><li><strong>Rahel Jaeggi - Progress and Regression (2024?).</strong> Not yet published in English.</li></ul><h2>Books or articles I haven't read yet. I might read them but I consider \"less directly relevant\" or \"less pressing\".</h2><ul><li><strong>Peter Richerson and Robert Boyd - Not By Genes Alone: How Culture Transformed Human Evolution (2005).</strong> I want to go further back than Henrich on the topic of cultural evolution. They also have their 1985 book which is more technical, so I'll probably read this first.</li><li><strong>Michael Tomasello - A Natural History of Human Morality. (2017)</strong> I've read like half of this and it was good. Might finish it.</li><li><strong>Graeber and Weingrow - The Dawn of Everything (2022).</strong> Seems to perhaps contradict the Pinker narrative on early societies, which supposedly were very varied and had different configurations and \"experiments of living\"? Unsure. Need to check it out to confirm.</li><li><strong>Christina Bicchieri - Norms in the Wild and Grammar of Society.</strong> I've had her work referenced by several people with regards to mine.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Ara Norenzayan - Big Gods. &nbsp;- </strong>Big collaborator with Joseph Henrich on the role of religion in shaping moral norms.</li><li><strong>Jared Diamond (1998). Guns, germs, and steel: A short history of everybody for the last 13,000 years.</strong></li><li><strong>Jared Diamond (2005). Collapse: How societies choose to fail or succeed. </strong>- Might consider just listening to the audiobook since his works are quite long.</li><li><strong>Paul Bloom - Against empathy: The case for rational compassion.

An Economic History of the 20th Century.</strong></li></ul><p>If you have any other reading recommendations that you think are extremely relevant or very relevant to my work that I might have missed, please do let me know!</p><h2>Potentially interesting extensions but probably beyond the scope of my work.</h2><ul><li><strong>Rahel Jaeggi - Critique of Forms of Life.</strong> I've read Jaeggi before. She's a philosopher that tries to make Critical Theory and typically Marxist concepts such as Ideology and Alienation accessible to an audience that might be not immersed in that kind of Critical Theory literature. She has a book on Alienation and a paper on Rethinking Ideology which I thought were good. But this might be too off topic right now.</li><li><strong>Hayek on information signals, etc.</strong> I've read Hayek's \"Use of Knowledge in Society\" and his book on socialism (The Fatal Conceit: The Errors of Socialism), which is not really about socialism but about free information signals in society. Interesting ideas but better developed by later authors as cultural evolution. I'm not sure which economists have focused on the flow of information after Hayek, and I'd love to know more about that.</li><li><strong>Popper on the Open Society, and/or on the evolutionary development of science.</strong> I've read some of this in undergrad as well as more recently, particularly being at LSE, the department that housed Popper for his academic life. But I think more recent authors perhaps flesh out the ideas more carefully.</li><li><strong>Joel Moykr on the Industrial Revolution. </strong>One of the key economic historians.<strong> </strong>Apparently outlines the independent breakthroughs of the telegraph, color photography, telephone... Same technology at different places.</li><li><strong>David Livingstone Smith (2011). Less than human: Why we demean, enslave, and exterminate others.</strong> - I read his other book on dehumanization and didn't get much from it.</li><li><strong>Frans de Waal - Good Natured: The Origins of Right and Wrong in Humans and Other Animals (1996).</strong> I've read other works by Frans de Waal, but this one seems the most cited by philosophers.</li><li><strong>Christopher Boehm - Hierarchy in the Forest (2001).</strong> I've read a bit of Boehm. Basically, his core claim is that we went from dominance hierarchies, where an alpha ape dominates the group, to a reverse dominance hierarchy of a group dominates and overtakes the alpha. Could potentially offer important insights on the early development of morality.</li></ul><h1>EA work on Moral Progress and related topics.</h1><p>Here are some examples of EAs that have worked on the topic of moral progress that I think are worth reading. The list is far from exhaustive, but I believe useful as initial guidance.</p><p><i>(I'm not a big podcast listener, so if you have more EA-aligned podcasts discussing these topics, please leave a comment.)</i></p><h3>Moral Circle Expansion.</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/moral-circle-expansion-1\"><strong>Moral Circle Expansion tag</strong></a><strong> on the EA Forum. </strong>Many or even most of these are good. Many of these people have also independently noticed that moral circles aren't really moral circles, that once you break it down there are hidden complexities. I believe our independent findings should move us in the direction of dropping the term \"moral circle expansion\", even if it's a beautiful image/metaphor, for the far more general phenomenon of \"moral progress\".</li><li><strong>Jacy Reese Anthis - </strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WebLP36BYDbMAKoa5/the-future-might-not-be-so-great\"><strong>The Future Might Not Be So Great</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/BY8gXSpGijypbGitT/why-i-prioritize-moral-circle-expansion-over-reducing\"><strong>Why I Prioritize Moral Circle Expansion Over Reducing Extinction Risk Through Artificial Intelligence Alignment</strong></a><strong>, as well as the website of </strong><a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/\"><strong>Sentience Institute</strong></a><strong>, which focuses on moral circle expansion </strong>- Very long posts but well worth reading, I think.</li><li><strong>Anthis, Jacy and Paez, Eze (2021). </strong><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016%2Fj.futures.2021.102756\"><strong>\"Moral circle expansion: A promising strategy to impact the far future\"</strong></a></li><li><strong>Applied Divinity Studies - </strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ipTZDyLKFFBpeiHYR/does-moral-philosophy-drive-moral-progress\"><strong>Does Moral Philosophy Lead to Moral Progress?</strong></a> - Basically argues that <i>\"rather than being driven by moral philosophy, what we have instead is a societal shift driven by a scientific advance, which subsequently allowed rapid liberalization\"</i>. That is, wide social progress is more important than narrow intentional philosophical moral progress. I agree, with the caveat that as moral insights become harder to find, moral philosophy might become more important over time.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Luis Mota Freitas - </strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gDc9PXCc9RQf4dzMP/moral-progress-reading-list\"><strong>Moral Progress Reading List </strong></a><strong>-</strong> Similar to my bibliography, but briefer and uncommented.

Sevilla is skeptical that we can substantially influence the value of our descendants. This puts pressure on the picture of the cultural evolutionists like Henrich above, because there would be less cultural inheritance and more random drift. It also goes against my view and Hanno Sauer's (2023) view, because we think that basically inertia and value replication have been the standard with regards to moral values (at least until the Industrial Revolution, where change accelerated), with very minor but accelerating improvements each generation. Probably deserves further research, but the broad academic debate probably won't be settled soon.</li><li><strong>Zach Freitas Groff - </strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jCwuozHHjeoLPLemB/how-long-do-policy-changes-matter-new-paper\"><strong>How Long Do Policy Changes Matter?&nbsp;</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/value-drift\"><strong>Value drift tag on the EA Forum.</strong></a></li><li><strong>Michael Aird - </strong><a href=\" https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EMKf4Gyee7BsY2RP8/michaela-s-shortform?commentId=a3dN6Mehzzipyu5sg \"><strong>Collection of work on value drift that isn't on the EA Forum</strong></a></li></ul><h3>Longtermist Institutional Reform.</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/longtermist-institutional-reform\"><strong>Longtermist Institutional Reform tag on the EA Forum</strong></a><strong>.</strong> If we care about moral and social progress, it's often with the idea of securing it or speeding it up, by improving transmission of good moral values or institutions or, so it connects to this idea.</li><li><strong>Tyler John - </strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/op93xvHkJ5KvCrKaj/institutions-for-future-generations\"><strong>Institutions for Future Generations</strong></a><strong>, and </strong><a href=\"https://Follow-up on &quot;Institutions for Future Generations&quot;\"><strong>Follow-up on \"Institutions for Future Generations\"</strong></a><strong> </strong>- The first lays out 33 different ways of representing future generations, the second provides articles he wrote on the topic and a big Google Docs with a literature review on this topic.
