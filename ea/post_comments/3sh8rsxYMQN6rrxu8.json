You raise important and interesting questions.</p><p>I do think EA should continue to steer clear of overtly partisan-political issues, especially in highly polarized societies like the U.S. This is for a few reasons:</p><ol><li>EAs seem to lean Left politically, according to EA surveys; but to engage with partisan politics in a morally and epistemically humble way, we'd need a real diversity of political attitudes within EA to provide checks and balances against unconscious political biases and virtue-signaling.</li><li>Partisan politics tends to involve controversies that are often not neglected, tractable, or scope-sensitive, so they're often a poor fit for EA. Modern political parties exist not to solve real-world problems, but to raise money, get votes, amass power, support virtue-signaling, and make partisans feel good. EA exists to solve real-world problems efficiently and open-mindedly, so its principles and goals simply 'don't compute' to most partisan politicians, activists, and voters.</li><li>Politics is a game for older, cynical sociopaths who understand how power works, not for idealistic young EAs who, dare I say it, are often quite naive about the nature of power and how it's gained and wielded. (I'm in my mid-50s, and I'm only just starting to understand how American politics actually operates; I'm dubious that EAs younger than about 40 would end up being anything more than pawns in political games they don't understand.)</li><li>Political engagement is highly addictive, rewarding, thrilling, and distracting. (Trust me on this, as someone who's all too engaged on political Twitter.) For many EAs &nbsp;trying to work at the intersection of politics and EA, the political side would often end up pulling them away from their EA principles and cause areas.</li><li>Politics tends to be very nation-specific and culture-specific, whereas EA aspires to global relevance. Insofar as EAs tend to be from the US, UK, Germany, Australia, and few other 'Western liberal democracies', we might end up focusing too much on the kinds of political institutions and issues typical of these countries. This would lead to neglect of other countries with other political values and issues. But even worse, it might lead us to neglect geopolitically important nation-states such as China and Russia where our 'Western liberal democracy' models of politics just don't apply very well. This could lead us to neglect certain ideas and interventions that could help nudge those countries in directions that will be good for humanity long-term (e.g. minimizing global catastrophic risks from Russian nukes or Chinese AI).</li></ol><p>For all these reasons, I think EA should strive to avoid the realm of politics, and just do our own thing, in what we could think of as 'non-political stealth mode', flying under the radar of the usual partisan-politics system of news, activism, power, and propaganda.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "geoffreymiller"}}, {"_id": "aaMKYm4yeMbWmFDeA", "postedAt": "2022-11-03T23:51:19.927Z", "postId": "3sh8rsxYMQN6rrxu8", "htmlBody": "<p>I think these are great points for the movement in general and for \"politics\" in general, but I still think it's more complicated in some cases.&nbsp;<br><br>For example, I'm just not convinced we can dismiss the EV of investing in having EA/EA-adjacent people in power, even if any given person is expected to make ~0 counterfactual difference, just in case the have to respond to a pivotal emergency-- it would be convenient if we could, but I don't think we can. &nbsp;<br><br>I'm doing a pretty grubby, what you call \"real-world\" project trying to get people to use less rat poison, but nothing I do to try to achieve that is outside of the reach of the law. My ideal solution would be to create birth control that is superior to rodenticides and even more convenient so that people will voluntary switch to that, but even if I had the perfect product in hand, marketing it would require navigating a maze of policy and special interests. Zooming out, there would much more incentive to create such a product if there were more restrictions on rodenticide use, and given their toxicity and destructive effect on the ecosystem, there are plenty of people already trying to do that. &nbsp;Do we ally with them? What if all we need to do is sign onto the coalition sponsoring a bill? What if we don't 100% agree with the bill? I just think the answer to questions like that is going to be case-by-case.&nbsp;<br><br>I don't like doing political stuff. &nbsp;It feels icky to me and I feel pretty naturally disadvantaged at political maneuvering. I would love if there were an EA reason not to have to deal with it.

And even then, the chance of failure is still high. A moment's slip up or bad assumptions or a random event can undermine months or years of work. This doesn't happen as often in other areas.&nbsp;</li><li>For animal welfare, I think the outcomes show that it's something people are more willing to vote for than pay for, so I think ballot initiatives are generally a good route to try out. I think the pork industry challenge to the MA law is pretty weak, but even if the initiative is struck down, it was probably good to try and see if it worked, and that may still open up some new opportunity. Winning by a large margin is good in that it may discourage special interests from trying to run a counter ballot initiative next time to repeal it. &nbsp;</li><li>I think it's important not to become naive about anyone elected to office. Just because they have a similar background to you, say things you agree with, or belong to a group you like doesn't mean they're going to actually do good things or that the things they do are good. Just because they seem right about one or even many topics doesn't mean they know what they are doing on other topics.&nbsp;</li><li>Politics is about coalition building and that often means various kinds of deal making.

The opposite of that is having a committed constituency that votes enough in elections to not be worth upsetting - aka a base of people power. These take serious effort to create and not all groups are distributed geographically the same way so some have more/easier influence than others. One reason the NRA is so powerful and not abandoned despite negative media coverage is that they have tight relationships with Republican politicians and they turn out big time in any primary where someone opposes them or something they want. It's not so much about the campaign contributions as far as I can tell (other groups spend far more and are much less influential) though campaign contributions are certainly a part of their system of carrots and sticks.&nbsp;<br><br>The lack of more broad participation in primaries is a problem for represenation and responsive good government. It's an opportunity for groups that aren't all that representative to magnify their influence. Alaska's top 4 primary election seems like a step in the right direction since it opens up primaries to more voters and then &nbsp;lets voters rank the top 4 candidates in November. It increases the chances that someone can try to run and win as a more representative candidate instead of being filtered out by small, highly partisan groups.&nbsp;<br><br>It's often easier to stick to established narratives, group identifiers, and allies, or even make up new conspiracies than to be measured and nuanced. Something inflamatory and/or conspiratorial is more likely to hook into human brains, be amplified by engagement seeking algorithms, and, if it's obscure but rapidly repeated, not have any better sources of information competing with it when people look up its key words.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "tAR3H72fRBmxK6TdM", "user": {"username": "Peter Gebauer"}}, {"_id": "brALbuHrSZyHz43Mm", "postedAt": "2022-11-04T22:46:34.987Z", "postId": "3sh8rsxYMQN6rrxu8", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>I'm dubious that EAs younger than about 40 would end up being anything more than pawns in political games they don't understand</p></blockquote><p>Can't disagree, only 32, still don't fully understand how american politics works.</p>", "parentCommentId": "8bopehMWK2hkCDSzR", "user": {"username": "MakoYass"}}, {"_id": "phSGN5mYjGA5yMwEX", "postedAt": "2022-11-04T22:52:56.051Z", "postId": "3sh8rsxYMQN6rrxu8", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>More generally, I think it might be helpful to recruit and influence people who are already active in political life to adopt EA values and views as part of their 'private persona' -- as long as &nbsp;we don't form explicit public alliances with organized political parties or partisan movements.</p></blockquote><p>Yes, I think this.
