Effective Causes is new and mostly not set up formally yet. It is literally still just an idea in my head and rough blueprints. One of the reasons I'm fundraising for that is to setup formally. &nbsp;The quora and every effectiveDAO link you find were all created by me so that when the project kicks off I will already have those names instead of some cybersquatter hijacking the name. when the actual project begins they will all be cleaned up and readied for use.<br><br>Nothing much else by way of formality is going on, I just meet with a couple of students from a nearby university talking to them about EA and we meet a few times to brainstorm and share ideas. The effectivedao.org domain has been registered by me pending when the website is setup. EffectiveCauses and the DAO and everything are really in a pre-launch state, nothing at all is setup.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The one person commenting in support of you looks a bit like an astroturf account (created recently, fake name/PFP).</p></blockquote><p>2. Not sure which person you are referring to, there were quite a number of comments on the other post and a few of them seemed supportive. But I have only one EA Forum account and I don't know and haven't asked &nbsp;any other person to comment in support of me, I have nothing to do with them. None of the people in EA who actually know my identity have commented so far. But I've shared the post in some communities where I'm active. I've been sharing it. &nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The Twitter account you linked to is also quite shallow (few posts/no substantive posts, no followers, etc.), as is your EA Forums account.</p></blockquote><p>The twitter is sparse because: The project is new. This post is my first major post about it in the public. The actual Twitter accounts are all rather new. Everything is new because its still literally an idea in my head. Only now do I plan to start tweeting more regularly.&nbsp;</p><p>I already created new twitter accounts for Effectivecauses and for the DAO but like I explained in the post, I've been having issues completing the registration due to twitter's phone verification issues so I had to use another twitter account of mine and delete all the previous posts so that I would have a twitter to use, albeit temporarily.</p><p>For my EA Forum account.
