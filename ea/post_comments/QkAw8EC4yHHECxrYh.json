However, during busy periods (e.g. if I have both teaching and service obligations) I think my main option to this would be to do nothing and then binge work during vacations, which I have done before and I would expect to be more common.</p><p>I have had periods of working 6 hours a day pretty consistently. What distinguished these periods I think was that I was very intrinsically motivated about the research and had minimal other obligations to navigate at the same time, so I naturally ended up just thinking about my work most of the time.&nbsp;</p><p>Today when I'm in a position with more regular events during my week, I find this harder. If I schedule 6 hours of work a day (which I did for a large part of last year), I often end up with the feeling that I don't have enough time to navigate other things. I have done this for a few weeks for particular projects, but find it difficult to have as a default working aim. I personally found 4h/day somewhat of a sweet spot, and have been doing that consistently for the last few weeks.</p><p>With that said, I have pretty low confidence that effective 6h/day cannot be achieved by others. My main aim with this post was to illustrate some ways in which a lower number achieves many of the benefits I was aspiring to with working more, and might at least for some have a substantial marginal impact on the costs of work. More generally, my experiences are obviously personal, and not something I would want people to put too much weight on.</p>", "parentCommentId": "kc3iMfoc4RDosBekN", "user": {"username": "paul_dfr"}}, {"_id": "aivQc54NmHomu66Ms", "postedAt": "2023-12-30T03:36:50.427Z", "postId": "QkAw8EC4yHHECxrYh", "htmlBody": "<p>A very interesting post that came just in time for my resolution in 2024, which will be my first year in college.
