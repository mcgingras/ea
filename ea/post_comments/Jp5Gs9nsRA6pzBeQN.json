Whilst i think it can be argued that people could give more effectively by shifting their giving from animal shelters to farmed animal advocacy, it depends somewhat on precision.  For people who are already donating to animal organisations which aren't shelters then it isn't necessarily better to give to &quot;effective&quot; organisations as put forward by ACE because there aren't sufficient comparisons that can be made between organisations they are already supporting, and there is also the issue of further marginalising organisations which aren't deemed a more mainstream fit (something which seems somewhat at odds with effective altruism). </p>\n<p>As an example, I continue to wonder why someone would necessarily believe it is better to give to GFI over an organisation doing pluralistic work in the animal movement?  One is well supported by various foundations and is far from underconsidered or neglected, whilst others that work on more meta level questions of plurality and inclusivity tend to be marginalised, particularly through not reflecting a favoured &quot;mainstream&quot; ideology.  Another issue is that ACE doesn't account for moral theory in relation to rights or utilitarianism thus largely presenting a fairly unfortunate picture in the animal movement in terms of utilitarian = effective and rights = ineffective.  This isn't something which would be reflective of effective altruism.  (I'm aware that NHRP is a &quot;standout&quot; charity and could be seen as an exception, yet their legal work is fairly separate from the more mainstream charities that work within / tend to reify speciesism in various ways).</p>\n<p>As a general matter at least some of my time is spent on social media informing people of the reasons why they ought to be sceptical of &quot;top charity&quot; recommendations when they have shared them from ACE, because non-EAs sometimes have a tendency to accept them at face value because they haven't particularly looked into the issues or wondered about ACE reasoning or process.  However, the same can also be said of many EAs who likely somewhat give to ACE on the basis of its EA association.  I support the idea of evaluation by ACE but i'm sceptical that the claims that ACE tend to make sufficiently reflect the work that has taken place, or that there is enough transparency in terms of the underlying values and beliefs that ACE tend to represent.  I continue to believe that some form of external meta-evaluation would be useful for ACE in order to thoroughly consider this type of issue, whilst donation matching and the sharing of cute animals could form a part of that.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "KevinWatkinson"}}, {"_id": "mWzWK5Ru5uTRc74nA", "postedAt": "2018-06-14T16:33:36.193Z", "postId": "Jp5Gs9nsRA6pzBeQN", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>Anecdotally, we\u2019ve found that our matching campaigns have brought in a disproportionately large number of new donors\u2014the majority of whom were not previously involved with effective giving.

My worry in the past was that ACE staff members were allowing image considerations to seep into the actual analyis that they were doing (sidenote: I\u2019d be interested to what extent ACE now uses Bayesian reasoning in their estimates, e.g. by adjusting impact by how likely small sample studies are false positives). </p>\n<p>When someone is already committed to EA, it tends to become difficult for them to imagine what got them originally excited about effectiveness in helping others and what might motivate new people who are not part of the \u2018early adopter crowd\u2019. There is a reason why EA pitches to newcomers also tend to be simple, snappy and focus on one \u2018identifiable victim\u2019 before expanding across populations, probabilities and time (my point being that these principles also apply to ACE\u2019s outreach). You cannot expect people to relate to abstract analysis and take action if they have not bridged that gap yet.</p>\n<p>However, I hope that ACE\u2019s stance on matching donations will cause other organisations in the effective animal advocacy community to follow their lead.

That donor would have made a donation to a charity anyway, and probably one in the factory farming space. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Therefore counterfactually-speaking, you can say that the donor probably wouldn't have donated to the recommended charity fund otherwise, not that another donor has doubled their impact.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Remmelt Ellen: &quot;You're donation is being matched \u2013&gt; you've just doubled your impact&quot; is a bold claim to make that's almost impossible to live up to \u2013 especially when done by a charity evaluator that should know better.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Remmelt Ellen: More on coordination matching and influence matching: <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/15/why-you-shouldnt-let-donation-matching-affect-your-giving/\">https://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/15/why-you-shouldnt-let-donation-matching-affect-your-giving/</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Marianne van der Werf: Good points Remmelt, you should share this conversation with ACE or ask them about their messaging in their upcoming Reddit AMA.

Alternatively, you are free to perform your own analysis to compare relative potential effectiveness; if performed well, such analyses could then be used in future reviews by ACE.</p>\n<p>Keep in mind that we explicitly believe a pluralistic approach is best overall. It's just that individual charities working on pluralistic approaches may have wildly different levels of effectiveness, and, given limited resources, we should prioritize whatever results in the most good.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Another issue is that ACE doesn't account for moral theory in relation to rights or utilitarianism thus largely presenting a fairly unfortunate picture in the animal movement in terms of utilitarian = effective and rights = ineffective.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We are quite transparent about the <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/about/background/our-philosophy/\">philosophical foundations of our work</a>.

However, we will continue to recommend that marginal resources support the most effective tactics.</p>\n<p>This is not an issue of rights vs utility. Whether you believe in rights or in utility, presumably you would want to do twice as much good with limited resources if you get the chance.</p>\n<p>(A quick aside on deontology vs consequentialism as it relates to cause prioritization: Let's say you're a deontologist who believes murder is wrong. You're given a coupon that you can redeem at one of two locations. If you redeem at the first, you prevent a murder. If you redeem at the second, you prevent two murders. Can you honestly say that, even as a deontologist, you wouldn't prefer to redeem at the second location?)</p>\n<p>The suffering of all animals is important, whether those animals are companion animals, animals in a lab, animals used in entertainment, or farmed animals. But when you have limited resources, you should prioritize helping those animals for which you can effectively reduce suffering. This is true whether you're talking about a rights organization or a utilitarian organization (to use your terminology).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p> I support the idea of evaluation by ACE but i'm sceptical that the claims that ACE tend to make sufficiently reflect the work that has taken place, or that there is enough transparency in terms of the underlying values and beliefs that ACE tend to represent.
