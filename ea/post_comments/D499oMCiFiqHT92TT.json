But it also feels worth recognising that substantial progress has been made and so a bunch more good stuff is being done; there being a given bottleneck is not in itself exactly a bad thing (since it'll basically always be true that <i>something </i>is the main bottleneck), but more a clue about what kind of activities will tend to be most impactful on the current margin.</li></ul>", "parentCommentId": "EHBy3PhvN28DakC8j", "user": {"username": "MichaelA"}}, {"_id": "WNxy2mh4KM656qzHY", "postedAt": "2021-11-19T13:45:37.952Z", "postId": "D499oMCiFiqHT92TT", "htmlBody": "<p>So there are a bunch of questions in this, but I can answer some of the ops related one:</p><ul><li>We haven't had ops talent bottlenecks.

The aforementioned researcher Carol Weiss finds that large majorities (65%-89%) of policymakers report being influenced by research in their work, and roughly half of them strongly (Weiss 1980; Weiss 1977). It's rare that policymakers pick up a study and implement an intervention directly. Instead, officials gradually work evidence into their worldviews as part of a gradual process of what Weiss calls \"enlightenment\" (Weiss 1995). Evidence also influences policy in more political but potentially still benign ways by justifying existing policies, warning of problems, suggesting new policies or making policymakers appear self-critical (Weiss 1995; Weiss 1979; Weiss 1977).</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>There are a few methods that seem to successfully promote evidence-based policy in health care, education, and government settings where they have been tested. The top interventions are:</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2a) Education\u2014Workshops, courses, mentorship, and review processes change decision makers' behavior with regard to science in a few studies (Coburn et al. 2009; Matias 2017; Forman-Hoffman et al. 2017; Chinman et al. 2017; Hodder et al. 2017).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2b) Organizational structural changes\u2014If an organization has evidence built into its structure, such as having a research division and hotline, encouraging and reviewing employees based on their engagement with research, and providing funding based on explicit evidence, this seems to improve the use of evidence in the organization (Coburn and Turner 2011; Coburn 2003; Coburn et al. 2009; Weiss 1980; Weiss 1995; Wilson et al. 2017; Salbach et al. 2017; Forman-Hoffman et al. 2017; Chinman et al. 2017; Hodder et al. 2017).\nA few other methods for promoting research-backed policies seem promising based on a bit less evidence:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2c) Increasing awareness of evidence-based policy\u2014Sending employees reminders or newsletters seems to increase research-based medicine based on two high-quality review papers (Murthy et al. 2012; Grimshaw et al. 2012). . Similarly, all-around advocacy campaigns to promote evidence-based practices among practitioners achieves substantial changes in one randomized controlled trial (Schneider et al. 2017).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2d) Access\u2014Merely giving people evidence on effectiveness does not generally affect behavior, but when combined with efforts to motivate use of the evidence, providing access to research does improve evidence-based practice (Chinman et al. 2017; Wilson et al. 2017).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>2e) External motivation and professional identities\u2014 Two recent RCTs and a number of reviews and qualitative research find that rewarding people for using evidence and building professional standards around using research are helpful (Chinman et al. 2017; Schneider et al. 2017;Hodder et al. 2017; Forman-Hoffman et al. 2017; Weiss et al. 2005; Weiss 1995; Wilson et al. 2017; Weiss 1980; Weiss 1977; Matias 2017; Coburn 2005; Coburn 2003).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Interestingly, a few methods to promote evidence-based practices that policymakers and researchers often promote do not have much support in the literature. The first is building collaboration between policymakers and researchers, and the second is creating more research in line with policymakers' needs One of the highest-quality write-ups on evidence-based policy, Langer et al. 2016 finds that collaboration only works if it is deliberately structured to build policymakers' and researchers' skills. When it comes to making research more practical for policymakers, it seems that when policymakers and researchers work together to come up with research that is more relevant to policy, it has little impact. This may be because, as noted in point (1), research seems to influence policy in important but indirect ways, so making it more direct may not help much.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>There is surprisingly and disappointingly little research on policymakers' cognition and judgment in general. The best research is familiar to the effective altruism community from Philip Tetlock (1985; 1994; 2005; 2010; 2014; 2016) and Barbara Mellers (2015), and it gives little information on how decision-makers respond to scientific evidence, but suggests that they are not very accurate at making predictions in general. Other research indicates that extremists are particularly prone to overconfidence and oversimplification, and conservatives somewhat more prone to these errors than liberals (Ortoleva and Snowberg 2015; Blomberg and Harrington 2000; Kahan 2017; Tetlock 1984; Tetlock 2000). Otherwise, a little research suggests that policymakers in general are susceptible to the same cognitive biases that affect everyone, particularly loss aversion, which may make policymakers irrationally unwilling to end ineffective programs or start proven but novel ones (Levy 2003; McDermott 2004). On the whole, little psychological research studies how policymakers react to new information.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If anyone reading this works at a governmental organization, we\u2019d love to chat!</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "QjvC6omnFxcnP5DHn", "user": {"username": "Incogneilo18"}}, {"_id": "sWCceFA6pvKyoz2JQ", "postedAt": "2021-11-19T16:04:13.683Z", "postId": "D499oMCiFiqHT92TT", "htmlBody": "<p>Here's some parts of my personal take (which overlaps with what Abraham said):</p><p>I think we ourselves feel a bit unsure \"why we're special\", i.e. why it seems there aren't very many other EA-aligned orgs scaling this rapidly &amp; gracefully.</p><p>But my guess is that some of the main factors are:</p><ul><li>We <i>want </i>to scale rapidly &amp; gracefully<ul><li>Some orgs have a more niche purpose that doesn't really require scaling, or may be led by people who are more skilled and excited about their object-level work than about org strategy, scaling, management, etc.</li></ul></li><li>RP thinks strategically about how to scale rapidly &amp; gracefully, including thinking ahead about what RP will need later and what might break by default<ul><li>Three of the examples I often give are ones Abraham mentioned:<ul><li>Realising RP will be be management capacity constrained, and that it would therefore be valuable to give our researchers management experience (so they can see how much they like it &amp; get better at it), and that this pushes in favour of running a large internship with 1-1 management of the interns<ul><li>(This definitely wasn't the <i>only</i> motivation for running the internship, but I think it was one of the main ones, though that's partly guessing/vague memory.)</li></ul></li><li>Realising also that maybe RP should offer researchers management training</li><li>Expanding ops capacity before it's desperately urgently obviously needed</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>RP also just actually does the obvious things, including learning and implementing standard best practices for management, running an org, etc.</li></ul><p>And that all seems to me pretty replicable!&nbsp;</p><p>OTOH, I do think the people at RP are also great, and it's often the case that people who are good at something underestimate how hard it is, so maybe this is less replicable than I think.

Several main considerations come to mind when thinking about running a fellowship/internship program.</p><ul><li><strong>Managers\u2019 capacity and preparedness</strong> \u2013 hosting a fellow/intern may be a rewarding experience. However, working with fellows/interns is also time-consuming. It seems to be important to keep in mind that managers may need to have a dedicated portion of time to:<ul><li>Prepare for their fellows/interns\u2019 arrival, which may include drafting a work plan, thinking about goals for their supervisees, and establishing a plan B, in case something unexpected comes up (for example, data is delayed, and the analysis cannot take place)</li><li>Explain tasks/projects, help set goals, and brainstorm ideas on how to achieve these goals</li><li>Regularly meet with their fellows/interns to check in, monitor progress, as well as provide feedback and overall support/guidance throughout the program</li><li>Help fellows/interns socialize and interact with others to make them feel included, welcomed, and a part of the team/organization.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Operations team capacity and preparedness</strong> \u2013 there are many different tasks associated with each stage of the fellowship/internship program. It\u2019s crucial to ensure that the Operations Team has enough capacity and time to hire, onboard, support, and offboard fellows/interns, especially when the program is open to candidates worldwide. For example, we work with an international employment organization that acts as a proxy employer in each of the countries our staff and fellows/interns are based. Taking into account the amount of coordination needed between international employment organization \u2013 staff internally \u2013 fellows/interns is important (the amount will vary significantly between adding 2-3 vs. 10 fellows/interns to the team).</li><li><strong>Internal processes</strong> \u2013 capacity is one thing, but having strong, internal processes developed beforehand appears to be equally vital. This refers to hiring and candidate selection procedures, establishing reasonable timelines, setting up check-in structures with both fellows/interns and managers, as well as organizing relevant professional development and social opportunities.</li><li><strong>Hiring internationally and remotely</strong> \u2013 it may be worth considering where most of the team members are located. If most of the staff are in the US time zones, then it may make sense to think how that could affect candidates from completely different time zones (e.g., Australia and Oceania). Will they be able to communicate with their managers easily? Will they have enough opportunities to interact with other fellows/interns and colleagues?</li></ul><p>In summary, any fellowship and internship program may be truly beneficial to the organization running it. Most importantly, however, the questions are how to make the program beneficial to fellows/interns, and how will it impact their future education paths and careers.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "7tmxCWi4SYeJ8Fgv8", "user": {"username": "Domii_1987"}}, {"_id": "cBupzfr3gw8wyNFeP", "postedAt": "2021-11-19T19:27:19.611Z", "postId": "D499oMCiFiqHT92TT", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks!

Ultimately, I think it\u2019s some combination of these traits, luck, and good timing that has lead us to be where we are today.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "Q9WkMKNjceedzrLZa", "user": {"username": "Marcus_A_Davis"}}, {"_id": "Z8zWB7YCcc87NtSzG", "postedAt": "2021-11-19T22:38:47.667Z", "postId": "D499oMCiFiqHT92TT", "htmlBody": "<p>The short answer is that a) none of our past hires in longtermism (including management) had substantive &nbsp;biosecurity experience or biosecurity interest and b) no major stakeholder has asked us to look into biosecurity issues.</p><p>The extended answer is pretty complicated. I will first go into why generalist EA orgs or generalist independent researchers may find it hard to go into biosecurity, explain why I think those reasons <i>aren't</i> as applicable to RP, and then why we haven't gone into biosecurity anyway.</p><p><strong>Why generalist EA orgs or generalist independent researchers may find it hard to go into biosecurity</strong></p><p>My personal impression is that EA/existential biosecurity experts currently believe that it's very easy for newcomers in the field to do more harm than good, especially if they do not have senior supervision from someone in the field. This is because existential biosecurity in particular is rife with <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/information-hazard\">information hazards</a>, and individual unilateral actions can invoke the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/unilateralist-s-curse\">unilateralist's curse</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>Further, all the senior biosecurity people are very busy, and are not really willing to take the chance with someone new unless they a) have experience (usually academic) in adjacent fields or b) are credibly committed to do biosecurity work for a long period of time if they're a good fit.&nbsp;<br><br>Since most promising candidates are understandably not excited to commit to doing biosecurity work for a long period of time without doing some work on it first, this creates a chicken-and-egg problem.<br><br>(Note again this is <i>my own impression</i>. Feel free to correct me, any biosecurity experts reading this!)</p><p><strong>Why RP in particular may be a good place to start a biosecurity career anyway.</strong></p><p>I think RP is institutionally trusted by the major groups enough to be careful if we were able to wade into biosecurity. In particular, we would be careful to not publish things that we think are potentially dangerous without running it by a few more experienced people first, and also we are credibly very willing to take down things quickly if we get a \"cease and desist\" from more experienced parties first (and then carefully reassess offline whether this was the correct move to do).&nbsp;</p><p>On an individual level, I have a number of contacts with some of the key biosecurity people in EA, both through covid forecasting before joining RP, and socially. &nbsp;In addition, I believe I can credibly pull off \"non-expert making useful and not-dangerous contributions to biosecurity\" as my <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/83rHdGWy52AJpqtZw/i-m-linch-zhang-an-amateur-covid-19-forecaster-and\">covid forecasting</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/y8jHKDkhPXApHp2gb/cultured-meat-a-comparison-of-techno-economic-analyses\">cultured meat analysis</a> experiences have at least somewhat demonstrated an ability to provide value via reading, disseminating, and evaluating fairly technical work in adjacent domains (as a non-expert).&nbsp;</p><p>So I'd maybe be excited to do biosecurity projects within my range of capabilities if stakeholders reached out to us with sufficiently important/interesting projects, or (more plausibly) advise colleagues/interns/contractors who can provide enough technical expertise while I provide the less technical guidance.</p><p><strong>Why we haven't gone into biosecurity anyway</strong></p><p>As you may have already inferred from past sentences, the biggest reason* is that none of our hires have had biosecurity experience or even strong interest. This is another chicken-and-egg problem. We haven't done biosecurity work because we don't have strong biosecurity hires, but we don't have strong (enough) biosecurity candidates applying because they don't see us doing biosecurity work.&nbsp;<br><br>One of my planned ways around this was trying to get a biosecurity intern last summer, in the hopes that having public outputs in biosecurity by an intern would be a smooth way for us to both scale up our institutional biosecurity knowledge and also demonstrate our interest in this arena. The idea is that interns with the relevant backgrounds (eg math bio, or epidemiology) can provide the technical backgrounds while RP complements their skillsets with the relevant EA contacts, discretion, and analytical ability.&nbsp;</p><p>I did try nontrivially hard to make this happen smoothly. I asked some promising biosecurity people to apply.I got verbal agreement from some FHI bio people to be a co-advisor to our biosecurity-interested interns if we had any. And some of the questions in our (blinded) intern assessment process should have differentially been easier for people with bio backgrounds.</p><p>But ultimately our strongest intern candidates last round neither had the relevant academic backgrounds nor were particularly interested in biosecurity.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Next steps</strong></p><p>RP's longtermism team is currently going through a hiring round. It seems plausible we might just have a strong biosecurity hire this round, in which case they'd lead our future biosecurity efforts in 2022 and this discussion is moot.</p><p>It also seems plausible to me if unlikely (~20% in the next 6 months?) for us to end up prioritizing biosecurity even without a strong biosecurity hire, whether due to internal cause prioritization or external stakeholder requests. &nbsp;</p><p>At any rate, if you or others reading this want to support future RP biosecurity efforts, the best way to do this is encouraging strong biosecurity people you know to apply in future rounds! Funder interest is also helpful, but substantially less so.<br><br>*we also have internal disagreements about whether it makes sense for us to be more proactive about doing biosecurity work, a) given that we're already scattered pretty thin on many projects, b) focus is often good, and c) we internally disagree about how important marginal biosecurity work by people without technical expertise is anyway.

And I'm glad it's done so, since I'd guess that may have contributed to RP starting and scaling up the longtermism department (even though naively I'd now prefer RP be more longtermist).</strong></p><p>I think RP is unusually good at scaling, at being a modular collection of somewhat disconnected departments focusing on quite different things and each growing and doing great stuff, and at meeting the specific needs of actors making big decisions (especially EA funders; note that RP also does well at other kinds of work, but this type of work is where RP seems most unusual in EA).&nbsp;</p><p>Given that, it could well make sense for RP to be somewhat agnostic between the major EA causes, since it can meet major needs in each, and adding each department doesn't <i>very strongly </i>trade off against expanding other departments.&nbsp;</p><p>(I'd guess there's at least some tradeoff, but it's <i>possible</i> there's none or that it's on-net complementary; e.g. there are some cases where people liking our work in one area helped us get funding or hires for another area, and having lots of staff with many areas of expertise in the same org can be useful for getting feedback etc. One thing to bear in mind here is that, as noted elsewhere in this AMA, there's a lot of funding and \"junior talent\" theoretically available in EA and RP seems unusually good at combining these things to produce solid outputs.)</p><p>I would personally like RP to focus much more exclusively on longtermism. And sometimes I feel a vague pull to advocate for that. But RP's more cause-neutral, partly demand-driven approach has worked out very well from my perspective so far, in that it may have contributed to RP moving into longtermism and then scaling up that team substantially.[1] (I mean that from my perspective this is very good for the world, not just that it let me get a cool job.) So I think I should endorse that overall decision procedure.</p><p>This feels kind-of related to <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/tag/moral-trade\">moral trade</a> and maybe kind-of to the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Original_position\">veil of ignorance</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>That's <i>not </i>to say that I think we shouldn't think at all about what areas are really most important in general, what's most important on the current margin within EA, where our comparative advantage is, etc. I know we think at least somewhat about those things (though I'm mostly involved in decisions about the longtermism department rather than broader org strategy so I don't bother trying to learn the details). But I think maybe the tradeoffs between growing each area are smaller than one might guess from the outside, such that that sort of high-level internal cause area priority-setting is somewhat less important than one might've guessed.</p><p>This doesn't really directly answer your question, since I think Peter and Marcus are better placed to do so and since I've already written a lot on this semi-tangent...</p><p>[1] My understanding (I only joined in late 2020) is that for a brief period at its very beginning, RP had no longtermist work (I think it was just global health &amp; dev and animals?). Later, it had longtermism as just a small fraction of its work (1 researcher). RP only made multiple hires in this area in late 2020, after already having had substantial successes in other areas. At that point, it would've been unsurprising if people at the org thought they should just go all-in on their existing areas rather than branching out into longtermism. But they instead kept adding additional areas, including longtermism. And now the longtermism team is likely to expand quite substantially, which again could've been not done if the org was focusing more exclusively on its initial main focus areas.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "4ifLxFCQPn5E4gbtR", "user": {"username": "MichaelA"}}, {"_id": "jKD3C2G7cALkJnpBQ", "postedAt": "2021-11-20T09:50:18.071Z", "postId": "D499oMCiFiqHT92TT", "htmlBody": "<p>I'd also note things about scaling (as mentioned elsewhere in the AMA)</p>", "parentCommentId": "qRctDGkGw97KBdhPc", "user": {"username": "MichaelA"}}, {"_id": "P6gZFktzicekiRn9o", "postedAt": "2021-11-20T10:35:51.587Z", "postId": "D499oMCiFiqHT92TT", "htmlBody": "<p>That all sounds basically right to me, except that my impression is that the cruxes in internal (mild) disagreements about this are just about \"a) given that we're already scattered pretty thin on many projects, b) focus is often good\" and not \"c) we internally disagree about how important marginal biosecurity work by people without technical expertise is anyway\".&nbsp;</p><p>Or at least, I personally think I see (a) and (b) as some of the strongest arguments against us doing biosecurity stuff, while I'm roughly agnostic on (c) but I'd guess that there are <i>some </i>high-value things RP could do even if we lack technical backgrounds, and if some more senior biosecurity person said they really wanted us to do some project then I'd probably guess that they're right that we could be very useful on that.&nbsp;</p><p>(And to be clear, my bottom line would still be pretty similar to Linch's, in that if we get a person who seems a strong fit for biosecurity work, they seem especially interested in that, and some senior people in that area seem excited about us doing something in that area, I'd be very open to us doing that.)</p>", "parentCommentId": "Z8zWB7YCcc87NtSzG", "user": {"username": "MichaelA"}}, {"_id": "tipfWhsvuDmRiQXv8", "postedAt": "2021-11-20T10:44:20.070Z", "postId": "D499oMCiFiqHT92TT", "htmlBody": "<p>I expect we'll also talk a lot to various people outside of RP who have important decisions to make and could potentially be influenced by us and/or who just have strong expertise and judgement in one or more relevant domains (e.g., major EA funders, EA-aligned policy advisors, strong senior researchers) to get their thoughts on what it'd be most useful to do and the pros and cons of various avenues we might pursue.&nbsp;</p><p>(We sort-of passively do this in an ongoing way, and I've been doing a bit more recently regarding nuclear risk and AI governance &amp; strategy, but I think we'd probably ramp it up when choosing directions for next year.

We've run around 30 survey projects since we were founded. When I calculated this in June we'd run a distinct survey project (each containing between 1-7 surveys), on average, every 6 weeks.&nbsp;</p><p>Most of the projects aren't exactly top secret, but I err on the side of not &nbsp;mentioning the details or who we've worked with unless I'm certain the orgs in question are OK with it. Some of the projects, though, have been mentioned publicly, but not published: for example, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/GfyuDTHvcwLTDp5fd/cea-update-q1-2021\">CEA mentioned in their Q1 update</a> that we ran some surveys for them to estimate how many US college students have heard of EA.</p><p>An illustrative example of the kind of project a lot of these are would be an org approaching us saying they are considering doing some outreach (this could be for any cause area) and wanting us to run a study (or studies) to assess what kind of message would be most appropriate. Another common type of project is just polling support for different policies of interest and &nbsp;testing the robustness of these results with different approaches. Both these kinds of projects are the most common but generally take up proportionately less time.</p><p>There are definitely a lot of other things that we can do and have done. For example the 'survey' team has also used focus groups before and would be interested in doing so again (which we think would be useful for a lot of EA purposes), and much of David Reinstein's work is better described as behavioural experiments (usually field experiments), rather than surveys.&nbsp;</p><p>Another aspect of our work that has increased a lot recently to a degree that was slightly surprising is what Peter refers to <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/K7tjvcDurrCj72D7H/rethink-priorities-2021-impact-and-2022-strategy#comments\">here</a> as \"ad hoc analysis requests\" and consulting (e.g. on analysis and survey design), without us actually running a full project ourselves. I'd say we've provided services like this to 8-9 different orgs/researchers (sometimes taking no more than a couple of hours, sometimes taking multiple days) in the last few weeks alone. As Peter mentions in that post, these can be challenging from a fund-raising perspective, although I strongly encourage people not to not reach out to us on that basis.&nbsp;</p><p>The projects we did used to be more FAW leaning, but over time the composition has changed a bit and, perhaps unsurprisingly, now contains more longtermist projects. Because the things we work on are pretty responsive to requests coming from other orgs, the cause-composition can change unexpectedly in a short space of time. Right now the projects we're working on are roughly evenly split between animals, movement building and meta, but it wouldn't be that surprising if it became majority longtermism over the next 6 months.</p>", "parentCommentId": "E2cDmtj9dGtvHMqrE", "user": {"username": "David_Moss"}}, {"_id": "sjwfGGyE599SWtymE", "postedAt": "2021-11-20T20:09:56.501Z", "postId": "D499oMCiFiqHT92TT", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks, that's exciting to hear!&nbsp;<br><br>For funded work, I wanted to know how much funding you expect to receive to do work for stakeholders. &nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "v8y6ab6N8Hr2Gr5yS", "user": {"username": "Peterslattery"}}, {"_id": "tFj4pJFMow2sZzeBR", "postedAt": "2021-11-21T17:23:30.049Z", "postId": "D499oMCiFiqHT92TT", "htmlBody": "<p>This is a little hard to tell, because often we receive a grant to do research, and the outcomes of that research might be relevant to the funder, but also broadly relevant to the EA community when published, etc.</p><p>But in terms of just pure contracted work, in 2021 so far, we've received around $1.06M of contracted work, (compared to $4.667M in donations and grants (including multi-year grants)), though much of the spending of that $1.06M will be in 2022.</p><p>In terms of expectations, I think that contracted work will likely grow as a percentage of our total revenue, but ideally we'd see growth growth in donations and grants too.</p>", "parentCommentId": "sjwfGGyE599SWtymE", "user": {"username": "abrahamrowe"}}, {"_id": "ccT9roDgJbgpTLkaE", "postedAt": "2021-11-21T18:47:57.746Z", "postId": "D499oMCiFiqHT92TT", "htmlBody": "<p>Strongly agree with this.
