Another route would be selling AI Safety solutions to non-AI safety firms. &nbsp;This solves many of the issues raised in the post but introduces new ones. &nbsp;As you mentioned in the Infertile Idea Space section, companies often start with a product idea, talk to potential customers, and then end up building a different product to solve a bigger problem that the customer segment has. &nbsp;In this context that could look like offering a product with an alignment tax, customers not being willing to pay it, pivoting to something accelerationist instead. &nbsp;You might think \"I would never do that!\" but it can be very easy to fool yourself into thinking you are still having a positive impact when the alternative is the painful process of firing your employees and telling your investors (who are often your friends and family) that you lost their money.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "colin"}}]
