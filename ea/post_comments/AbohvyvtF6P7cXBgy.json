I don't think that (for example) the talent bottleneck is relevant to how EA should respond to predatory behaviour: if people act in a predatory way, that should be acted on even if it makes it harder to find talent. The tradeoff is simple because one side of it should be entirely ignored.</p><p>I'm sure that many of the readers of this forum will disagree with me about this.

This is a good practice generally, because you never want to disincentivize people from reporting by making it so that them reporting has consequences they don't want. Usually the sorts of unwanted consequences in question are things like \"I'm afraid of backlash if someone tells X that I'm the one who reported them\" or \"I'm just saying this to help you establish a pattern of bad behavior by X, but I don't want to be involved in this so don't do anything about it just based on my report.\" But this sort of nonintervention request might also be made by victims whose point of view is \"I think X is doing really impactful work, and I want my report to at most limit their engagement with EA in certain contexts (e.g., situations where they have significant influence over young EAs), not to limit their involvement in EA generally.\" In other words, leave impact considerations to the victim's own choice.</p>\n<p>I'm not sure this the right balance.

I agree with a commenter above who says that \"The problem is not a lack of ideas that needs to be rectified by brainstorming - we have the information already. The problem seems to be that no one wants to act on this information.\" That being said, I have a few thoughts:&nbsp;</p><p>Regarding code of conduct at events, I'm hesitant to make hard and fast rules here. I think the reality around situations such as asking people out/hitting on people, etc, is that some people are better at reading situations than others. For example, I know couples who have started dating after meeting each others at &nbsp;my local EA group's events, and I don't think anyone would see an issue with that. The issue comes in when someone asks someone out/hits on someone and makes the other person uncomfortable in the process. That being said, not asking people out during 1:1s seems like a good norm (I'm surprised I even need to say this, to be frank), as does not touching someone unless you have explicitly asked for their consent to do so (this can apply even to something like hugs), and not making comments on someone's appearance/facial features/body.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of power structures/conflicts of interest, I would love to see us borrow more from other organisations that have good guidelines around this. I can't think of any specific ones right now, but I know from my time working in government that there are specific processes to be followed around conflicts of interest, including consensual workplace relationships. I'm sure others can chime in with organisations that do this well.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of hiring, I like what Rethink Priorities is doing. They attempt to anonymise parts of applications where possible, and ask people not to submit photos alongside their CVs. I think more could be done to encourage partially blind hiring/funding processes. For example, an employer/funder could write their first impression of someone's application without seeing any identifying information (eg. name, age, gender, ethnicity, etc), then do a second impression after. I'm conscious that names are quite important in EA and that this could add more work to already busy grant-making organisations, but maybe there is a way to do this that would minimise additional work while also helping reduce unconscious bias.&nbsp;</p><p>I would also love to see more writing/information/opinions come from the top-down. For example, people who have a big voice in effective altruism could write about this more often and make suggestions for what organisations and local groups can do. We already see this a bit from CEA, but it would be great to see it from other EA orgs and thought leaders. Sometimes I get a sense that people who are higher-up in the movement don't care about this that much, and I would love to be proven wrong.</p><p>Lastly, when it comes to engaging with posts on the forum about this topic, I was disappointed to recently see a post of someone writing about their experiences in the EA NYC community be met with a lot of people who commented disagreeing with how the post was written/how polyamorous men were generally characterised in the post. I think we should establish a norm around validating people when they have bad experiences, pointing them to the community health team, and taking steps to do better. There is no \"perfect victim\" - we need to acknowledge that sometimes people will have bad experiences with the community and will also hold opinions we disagree with. When they bring up their bad experience, it's not the time to say, \"not all men are like this\" or \"I disagree with how you went about bringing this up.\"&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "S.E.

These are *MY* thoughts they are not Magnify\u2019s thoughts- any controversies are mine alone.</p><p>(1) Not specific to the EA community but I wish people were kinder to one another and took more time to learn about each other's experiences, why they may have the feelings, and thoughts that they do, and where it is coming from. I think spaces that prioritize empathy and understanding are more conducive to working on fixing these problems together:</p><ol><li>There are small things like \"be careful with the jargon you use\", \"be careful to greet everyone and engage with them at your meet-up\" and supercharge your empathy when dealing with topics that might disproportionately affect people from underrepresented groups (such as racial and ethnic discrimination, gender-based harassment and violence, etc.) We want to get to the right answer quickly and efficiently but the most productive conversations I've had in this space adopt a team mindset and a heightened level of compassion.&nbsp;</li><li>The EA community\u2019s online spaces in particular need to work on strengthening empathy and compassion in all dialogues.&nbsp; For example, I was name-checked online a while back about how Magnify\u2019s description of our program participants (\u201cwomen and non-binary\u201d) was discriminatory against trans people. My initial reaction was to be hurt and mad but I forced myself to hear them as a person- she was hurt, and I was hurt- her underlying motivation was to make sure trans people felt comfortable and welcome- I wanted this too -we reached a resolution together without publically taking chunks out of each other and causing further harm.&nbsp;</li><li>I believe the EA community should have a ZERO asshole policy and stick to it bravely. The ideas of the person may be great but if the cost is driving excellent people out I don't believe it's worth it. For me personally, Robin Hanson is an example of this.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>(2) A mentee recently asked me if she could be an EA if she liked justice-shaped dialogues. I want to see EA as a toolkit where we all work together and bring in lots of different ideas, tools, and traditions to create excellent outcomes that positively shape the world and reduce suffering. A monolith or single identity is not conducive to this.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>(3) I\u2019m biased but I'd also love to see people spend more time mentoring. I think the focus on time optimization is great but it sometimes backfires in that people are not as willing to invest in newer EAs, particularly those who are undercooked. I believe I have had a large impact simply by having chats with people, pointing them at resources, and touching base with them in 6-months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>(4) I'd love to identify some better questions to accurately identify the \u201cseeds\u201d of what we now call value alignment. I think we are still using low-accuracy proxies such as who people know and books they have read. I'd love to deconstruct what we mean (I think it's prioritization clarity) by \u201cvalue alignment\u201d and how we can measure it correctly.&nbsp;</p><p>(5) These topics (power dynamics) are vitally, vitally important. I've been involved in EA for the better part of a decade so I have many people I genuinely love who are working in this space along with me. This network of affection is great, but it is also a very good reason to supercharge adopting best practices on declaring conflicts of interest and raising awareness of power dynamics on grants, hiring, etc. Julia Wise and the community health team have done some excellent work here but this emphasis needs to spread. (To be clear, I think over time EA organizations have significantly professionalized. Every time I have applied for funding&nbsp; I have needed to declare a conflict of interest because a couple of our board members work/ed at CEA. They also asked me to publicly display this on our website. This is to me a sign of a maturing movement and has helped in my opinion.)

Navigating the moral world is difficult and we certainly need to pay attention to nuances to navigate it well.</p><p>Yet as far as I'm concerned, it remains the case that someone's contributions via their work are irrelevant to assessing how we should respond to their serious wrongdoing. It's possible to accept the existence of nuance without thinking that all nuances matter. I do not think that this nuance matters.</p><p>(I'm happy to stick to discussing serious cases of wrongdoing and simply set aside the more marginal cases. I think it would represent such a huge step forwards if EA could come to robustly act on serious wrongdoing, so I don't want to get distracted by trying to figure out the appropriate reaction to the less crucial cases.)</p><p>I cannot provide an argument for this of the form that Oliver would like, not least because his comment suggests he might prefer an argument that is ultimately consequentialist in nature even if at some layers removed, but I think this is the fundamentally wrong approach.</p><p>Everyone accepts some moral claims as fundamental. I take it as a fundamental moral claim that when a perpetrator commits a serious wrong against someone &nbsp;it is the nature of the wrong (and perhaps the views of the person wronged, per Jenny's comment) that determine the appropriate response. I don't expect that everyone reading this comment will agree with this, and I don't believe it's always possible to argue someone into a moral view (I think at some fundamental level, we end up having to accept irreconcilable disagreements, as much as that frustrates the EA urge to be able to use reason to settle all matters).</p><p>(At this point, we could push into hypothetical scenarios like, \"what if you were literally certain that if we reacted appropriately to the wrongdoing then everyone would be tortured forever?\". &nbsp;Would the consequences still be irrelevant? Perhaps not, but the fact of the matter is that we do not live in a hypothetical world. I will say this much: I think that the nature of the wrongdoing is the vastly dominating factor in determining how to respond to that wrongdoing. In realistic cases, it is powerful enough that we don't need to reflect on the other considerations that carry less weight in this context.)</p><p>&nbsp;I've said I don't expect to convince the consequentialists reading this to accept my view. What's the point then? Perhaps I simply hope to make clear just how crucial an issue of moral conscience this is for some people.

The fact that the rest of society is also hostile to thieves isn't a reason for us to be nice to thieves - it is supportive evidence that we should also avoid theft, because similar reasons apply.

For example, I personally have met lots of polyamorous people in my life, and I've seen everything from perfectly healthy, well-functioning relationships to completely toxic relationships (just like monogamous relationships).

This idea is lifted directly from academia, which often mandates trainings of this sort. The professional versions are often quite dumb and involve really annoying unskippable videos; I think a non-dumb EA version would encourage the community organizer to read the content of the community health guide linked in the above post and then require them to pass a quiz about its contents (but if they can pass the quiz without reading the guide that's fine, the point is to check they understand the contents of the guide, not to make them read it). I imagine that better but higher-effort/more costly versions of this test would involve short answer questions (\"How would you respond to X situation?\"); less useful but lower-effort versions would involve multiple choice questions. To elaborate, the short answers version forces people to think more about their answer but also probably requires a team of people to read all these answers and check if they're appropriate or not, which is costly.</p>\n<p>-some institution (the community health team? I dunno) should come up with and institute codes of conduct for EA events and make sure organizers know about them. There'd presumably need to be multiple codes of conduct for different types of events. This ties in to the previous bullet since it's the sort of thing you'd want to make sure organizers understand. This is a bit of a vague and uninformed proposal -- maybe something like this already exists, although if so I don't know about it, which at minimum implies that if it exists it ought to be more widely advertised.</p>\n<p>-maybe a centralized page of resources for victims and allies, with advice, separate from the code of conduct? Don't know how useful this is</p>\n<p>-every medium/large EA event/group should have a designated community health point person, preferably female though not necessarily, who makes a public announcement that if someone makes you uncomfortable you can talk to the point person and with your permission they'll do what's necessary to help, and then follows through if people do report issues to them. They should also remind/inform everyone of the role of Julia Wise, and, if someone comes to them with an issue and gives permission to pass it on to her and her team, do that. (You might ask, if this point person is probably just gonna pass things on to Julia Wise, why even have a point person? The answer is that reporting is scary and it can be easier to report to someone you know who has some context on the situation/group.)</p>\n<p>Furthermore, making these things happen has to explicitly be someone's job, or the job of a group of someones. It's much likelier to actually happen in practice if it is someone's specific responsibility than if it's just an idea some people talk about on the Forum.</p>\n<p>Something I don't think helps much is: trying to tell all EAs that they should improve their behavior and stop being terrible. This won't work because unfortunately, self-identifying EAs aren't all cooperative nice individuals who care about not harming others personally. They don't have incentives to change just because someone tells them to, and worse offenders on these sorts of issues are also very likely to not be the sorts of people who want to read posts like this one about how to do better.

That argument seems true to me. &nbsp;</p><p>However, the argument hardly seems applicable to the egalitarian polyamory almost always practiced by effective altruists. Poly female effective altruists can and do date multiple people. Further, many poly effective altruists are in same-gender relationships.

People who have trouble finding a primary relationship can find a secondary relationship and receive many of the benefits of a romantic relationship.

The gender ratio varies a ton across different geographies and cause areas, but in my experience it ranges from roughly 50/50 to overwhelmingly male (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/YLudF7wvkjALvAgni/p/ThdR8FzcfA8wckTJi\">70/30 male/female per 2020 EA survey</a>). When I walk into a meetup and I\u2019m the only woman there, that affects my experience. This was particularly the case when I was first getting involved with EA as a teenager: part of deciding whether you stay involved with a community is your answer to \u201cam I welcome here? Is this community for people like me?,\u201d and repeatedly having experiences where I was one of the only women present gave me the sense that this community wasn\u2019t for people like me. That led me to engage less with EA, though I eventually returned; I suspect it\u2019s more common for women and people from underrepresented groups to \u201cbounce off\u201d of EA like this. It is genuinely surprising in many ways that EA doesn\u2019t have more women, as women tend to be way more involved in the non-profit sector more broadly. It doesn\u2019t have to be this way.&nbsp;</p><p>But the gender skew also affects things when there are issues. If someone makes some comment that makes you uncomfortable and the rest of your male conversational partners laugh it off, that\u2019s not super helpful. <strong>I think that, as a community, we should work to reduce the gender skew\u2014through making EA spaces more welcoming to women, investing in mentorship programs, etc.\u2014and actively take efforts to mitigate issues created by the gender skew</strong>. On a macro level, fewer women in the room when decision-making is occurring means that issues that affect women are less likely to receive their appropriate attention. That necessitates that institutions make a more active effort to pay attention to issues that effect women, collect women\u2019s opinions on issues that affect things, and yes, have more women in the room when decisions are happening. On a micro level, note when you\u2019re at a get-together and it\u2019s overwhelmingly monolithic (in terms of race, gender, etc.).

In a previous job, I conducted research related to institutional accountability and sexual assault. One common theme is that the way that institutions and communities respond to bad behavior by key figures is shaped by their norms and systems, with certain attributes making accountability more difficult to achieve. In my opinion, there are several aspects of the EA movement as it currently exists\u2014including the blurrier work/life boundaries for many folks, the outsize power of certain community leaders, the frequent reliance on ad-hoc rather than formal systems, and the movement\u2019s small size\u2014that make accountability particularly difficult, and I don\u2019t feel that we have done enough to create systems that respond to these risks.&nbsp;</p><p>Let\u2019s think through an example.

Clearly this is better than the alternative where the same considerations are applied to other ways of participating in the community.</p><p>2.)

Sadly, informal discussions are hard to provide concrete evidence of, so I pointed to an example that I take to be less egregious, though I still think on the wrong side of things here. I am more concerned by the general attitude that is held by some EAs I've spoken to than two specific lines of a specific post.</p><p>3.) People are banned from the forum for being rude in relatively minor ways. And yet let's imagine a hypothetical case where someone is accused of serious wrongdoing and further are specifically accused of carrying out some elements of wrongdoing via online social networks. It would seem weird to ban the first person for minor rudeness, but give the second person access to a platform that can allow them to build status and communicate with people via just the sort of medium that they allegedly used to carry out previous wrongdoing. Yet I think this is a plausible outcome of the current policies on when to ban people and how to react to interpersonal harm.</p><p>4.) &nbsp;I agree that it's a different question; I still don't think it's a difficult one. For a start, I think it's a little odd to conceive of this as \"suppressing\" content. People &nbsp;can still post content in lots of other places, and indeed other people can share it on the EA forum if they want to. Further, I don't think you can separate out enabling harm from posting to the forum, given that forum posts can confer status to people and status can help people to commit harm. So I think that the current policy just does enable harm. I think enabling this harm is the wrong call.</p><p>5.) I also think we could run the consequentialist case here, pointing to the fact that other people might not contribute to EA because they find the EA attitude to these cases concerning and don't feel safe or comfortable in the community.</p><p>All of that said, I think it's important to say again, per point 1, that I do agree that the issue is much less concerning when it doesn't involve real world contact between people, and that I appreciate you taking the time to reply.</p>", "parentCommentId": "9JESuoS9mCvGoccLC", "user": null}]
