(It seems to me that the main thing we can infer from heritability numbers is that if a trait has heritability above zero, then there's some genetic influence on it, but since you mention some traits having \"very high\" heritability, I presume that you find there to be some other information too.)</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Kaj_Sotala"}}, {"_id": "JBTx4YFjtZuhyTbZb", "postedAt": "2022-10-20T19:38:51.609Z", "postId": "bm4qeNJcc82BKJnWk", "htmlBody": "<p>This is also <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dRsrfC8LN4z2oehJg/the-heritability-of-human-values-a-behavior-genetic-critique\">on LessWrong</a>.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "tkwa"}}, {"_id": "nNeWKjzth8Fk7WHd5", "postedAt": "2022-10-20T20:44:18.546Z", "postId": "bm4qeNJcc82BKJnWk", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Kaj,</p><p>There's a lot of politically motivated misinformation about heritability, mostly so people feel comfortable ignoring and dismissing the results of behavior genetics.</p><p>IMHO, if one knows that the heritability of a psychological trait is fairly high, and the long-term effect of shared family environment is fairly low, this has big practical implications in a number of real-life domains:</p><ol><li>Mate choice. It's really important to pay attention to highly heritable trait when choosing a mate to have kids with, because their genes will have a big impact on their kids, and their parenting won't (within the range of parenting observable in one's population</li><li>Parenting. If a trait is highly heritable, but parenting doesn't make much difference, then parents can relax, enjoy their kids, and not try to push them, hothouse them, or try to shape them into someone they're not. Bryan Caplan, Steven Pinker, and others have emphasized that behavior genetics is very liberating for anxious parents. COnversely, if a kid gets a serious mental disorders that's highly heritable (e.g. schizophrenia, bipolar), then parents should feel less guilt that they messed up or caused the disorder (vs. 1950s theories that mothers caused schizophrenia)</li><li>Education. If intelligence is highly heritable, and conscientiousness is moderately heritable, within a population with a wide range of educational opportunities, then education won't do very much to boost intelligence or conscientiousness; this has implications for parents trying to decide whether to spend an extra few hundred thousand dollars on private school (vs public school)</li><li>Embryo selection. As polygenic scores get more accurate in predicting traits, parents will be able to choose among fertilized embryos to influence their offspring traits.
