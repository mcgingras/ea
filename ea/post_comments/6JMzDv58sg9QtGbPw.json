Funnily enough, I've heard <i>tales</i> of groups like this from the early days of EA groups, when people were just figuring things out, and this pattern would sometimes pop up.</p><p>I do want to push back a little bit on this:</p><blockquote><p>But <i>before</i> deferring, I think it's important to realize that you're deferring, and to make sure that you understand and trust who or what you're deferring to (and perhaps to first have an <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/2WS3i7eY4CdLH99eg/independent-impressions\">independent impression</a>). Many intro fellowship curricula (eg the EA handbook) come across more as manifestos than research agendas\u2014and are often presented as an ideology, not as evidence that we can use to make progress on our research question.</p></blockquote><p>The EA handbook (which nowadays is what the vast majority of groups use for their intro fellowships) includes three \u201cprinciples-first\u201d weeks (weeks 1, 2, and 7), which are meant to help participants develop their own opinions with the help of only the basic EA tools or concepts.</p><p>Furthermore, week 7 (\u201cWhat do you think\u201d) includes a reading of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/32FKXByGNgHLPaHnj/p/2WS3i7eY4CdLH99eg\">independent impressions</a>, and learning that concept (and discussing where EA might be wrong) is one of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/32FKXByGNgHLPaHnj/p/zGavnmS5hCC4mDHS8\">the key objectives of the week</a>:</p><blockquote><p>A key concept for this session is the importance of&nbsp;<strong>forming independent impressions</strong>. In the long run, you\u2019re likely to gain a deeper understanding of important issues if you think through the arguments for yourself. But (since you can\u2019t reason through everything) it can still sometimes make sense to defer to others when you\u2019re making decisions.</p></blockquote><p>In the past, a lot of work has been put in trying to calibrate how \u201cprinciples-based\u201d or \u201ccause-oriented\u201d intro fellowships should be, and I think the tradeoff can be steep for university groups since people can get rapidly disenchanted by abstract philosophical discussion about cause prioritization (as you mention). This can also lead to people treating EA as a purely intellectual exercise, instead of thinking of concrete ways in which EA ideas should (for example) change their career plans.</p><p>That said, I think there are other ways in which we could push groups further along in this direction, for example:</p><ul><li>We could create programming (like fellowships or workshops) around cause prioritization, exploring different frameworks and tools in the field. Not just giving a taste of these frameworks (like the handbook does), but also teaching hands-on skills that participants can use for actual cause prioritization research.</li><li>We could push for more discussion centered around exploratory cause research, for example, by creating socials or events in which participants try to come up with cause candidates and do some preliminary research on how promising they are (i.e. a \u201ccause exploration hackathon\u201d).</li></ul><p>I know there has been some previous work in this direction. For example, there's <a href=\"https://resources.eagroups.org/workshops-talks-ideas/ea-research-methods-workshop#block-3fda755fc2cb45999c21399ec172a260\">this workshop template</a>, or <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A-AJLTbukninH_enX0Ex_w-8S4dWj8TB4_-Qi1KGPvQ/edit#heading=h.jb2z0ni66pez\">this fellowship on global priorities research.</a> But I think we don't yet have a killer demo, and I would be excited about groups experimenting with something like this.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "agucova"}}]
