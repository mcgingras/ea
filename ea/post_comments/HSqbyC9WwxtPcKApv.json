It's <i>incredibly</i> moving, so thoughtfully, artfully composed, and as a new member to the forum I feel I'm in the right place here, reading about the foundations of why empathy and kindness are worth it, not just how it's applied on a grand scale. It presents alone the fearsome reality of suffering, with an implied silver lining that whatever means we have to mitigate it is of immense value, even if all we can do is think to ourselves \"I don't want that.\" It conveys better than any other what Effective Altruism means to me, why I've delved deep into it these past eight months, and why I let this school of thought direct my future plans, hopefully for decades to come.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "K.F.
