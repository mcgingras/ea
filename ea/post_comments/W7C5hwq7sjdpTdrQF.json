Those additions presume societal changes and AGI governance by existing or new laws. <strong>Can you constrain your description of a future where AGI perform tasks to make the legal distinction clear between AGI and software tools?</strong><br><br>Your idea of AGI presumably contrasts with rentable software instances that perform tasks and rely on a common pool of knowledge and capabilities. For example, I could rent multiple John Construction Worker instances for manipulation of construction bots for a particular project. I don't pay the instances, I just pay for them and the robotic construction equipment.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>In the event that automation allows AI to perform <i>all</i> &nbsp;human tasks, robot hardware will perform human activities. Robots can have their intelligence and knowledge associated at a hardware level with their bodies. For example, their learning can occur through training of their bodies rather than solely through software downloads, and their learning can be kept as local data only. Their affective experience can be linked to the action of their bodies in particular activities, potentially. They can also bear a superficial similarity to humans, particularly if their robot bodies are humanoid and employ similar senses (vision, hearing, tactile sense). <strong>These and other differences fulfill some of the description of a future containing AGI, but have different implications for the type of extinction threat posed by robots. Is that a distinction you consider worth making for the purposes of your contest?</strong><br>&nbsp;</li><li>When you write that AGI might do work at a rate of $25/hr, that seems implausible. In particular, a human-like intelligence without the data-processing constraints of a human engaged in a single focused activity (for example, researching a topic) can do some of the planned tasks involved at rates near instantaneous compared to a human. A human might take a week to read a book that an AGI reads in a couple of milli-seconds. Puzzling through the intuitions and logical implications of what was read in the book could take a human months, but an AGI could do the ontology refinement and knowledge development in under a hundred milliseconds. <strong>Again, can you constrain your example of AGI working like humans? For example, are you referring mainly to physical labor that AGI perform, perhaps through a humanoid robot?</strong><br>&nbsp;</li><li>Assuming an AGI is performing its labor at the speed of software, not the speed of a human exercising their intellect, we can agree that an AGI will do mental labor much faster than humans. However, physical labor depends on tasks and robotic hardware limits as well as software limits, and the speed differences are not as strong between humans and robot hardware. Hardware can get better, but not many orders of magnitude faster than a human (but maybe many more times as precise or reliable).<br><br>A further complication is that redefinition of tasks can alter the resource requirements and output constraints of labor. I'm not sure how that would affect an economic model of labor. <strong>Can you specify that (1)physical/engineering limits on robotics, and (2)task redefinition, don't matter to your economic criteria for AGI spread or is discussion of that something you are looking for in essays submitted to you?</strong><br>&nbsp;</li><li>Given the possibility that hardware requirements remain expensive to support a purely software entity, those entities might not be available for most types of work. Simpler data-processing tools and robots that seem advanced by our standards but much slower/cheaper/simpler could be widely available while actual AGI and conscious robots (or artificial life) are fairly rare, reserved for <i>very important</i> jobs, where human fallibility is perceived as too costly.<br><br><strong>If the outcome of increased productivity and innovation through AI investments pans out, but without AGI participating in most economic activity, is that relevant to your philanthropic interests here? That is, is all you care about the timing of the development of the </strong><i><strong>first</strong></i><strong> AGI, or is it a time when AGI are common or cheap or just when automation is replacing most jobs or something else?</strong></li></ol><p>Thank you for <i>your</i> &nbsp;time and good luck with your contest!&nbsp;<br>Also, good luck to the contestants!&nbsp;</p><p>:)</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Noah Scales"}}, {"_id": "rbcQimYpAT7HhxQed", "postedAt": "2022-09-24T11:35:26.773Z", "postId": "W7C5hwq7sjdpTdrQF", "htmlBody": "<p>I'm thinking more along the lines of how things are with the current level of progress on AI Alignment and AI Governance, or assuming that the needle doesn't move appreciably on these.

(I think this contest is a great idea; I'm just trying to anticipate some practical issues that might arise.)</p><p>EA Forum has a ethos of people offering ideas, getting feedback and criticism, and updating their ideas iteratively. For purposes of this contest, how would the judges treat essays that are developed in multiple versions?</p><p>For example, suppose a researcher posts version 1.0 of an essay on EA Forum with the \"Future Fund worldview prize\" tag. They get a bunch of useful feedback from other EA Forum members, refine their arguments, revise their essay, and post version 2.0 on EA Forum a couple weeks later (also with the tag). And so forth... through version 5.0 (or whatever).&nbsp;</p><p>1. Which version of the essay would judges be evaluating -- version 1.0, or version 5.0, or would they partly also be judging the extent to which the researcher really strengthened their argument through the feedback?</p><p>2. If version 1.0 had been published before this contest was announced (on Sept 23), and version 2.0 was published after that date, would version 2.0 be eligible?</p><p>3. This versioning issue might raise adverse incentives on forums &nbsp;- e.g. anyone developing their own competition entry might be incentivized to withhold praise or constructive feedback on someone else's essay, to downvote it, and/or to attack it with unusually incisive &nbsp;or detailed criticism. Or, friends and allies of an essay's author might be incentivized to lavish it with praise, upvote it, and counter-attack against any criticism.&nbsp;</p><p>4. This versioning issue might raise issues with credit assignment, prize money distribution, and potential resentments. For example, suppose a researcher's version 1.0 gets really helpful feedback on a couple of key points from other forum members, and incorporates their ideas into version 2.0 (possibly crediting them in some way, but not adding them as co-authors). What happens if version 2.0 then wins a big prize? It seems like the author would keep the prize money, but the people who helped them strengthen it might not get any reward, and might feel aggrieved.

I get how setting a benchmark - in this case an essay's persuasiveness at shifting probabilities you assign to different AGI / extinction scenarios - makes it easier to judge across the board.

Here's why:</p><ol><li>The focus is squarely on likelihood of things going wrong against different timelines. It has nothing to do with solutions space</li><li>But solutions are still needed, even if the likelihood reduces / increases by a large amount, because the impact would be so high.&nbsp;<ol><li>Take Proposition 1: humanity going extinct or drastically curtailing its future due to loss of control of AGI. I can see how a paper which changes your probabilities from 15% to either 7% or 35% would lead to FTX changing the amount invested in this risk relative to other X risks - this is good. However, I doubt it'd lead to a full on disinvestment, let alone that you still wouldn't want to fund the best solutions, or be worried if the solutions to hand looked weak</li></ol></li><li>Moreover, capabilities advancements have rapidly changed priors of when AGI / transformative AI would be developed, and will likely continue to do so iteratively. Once this competition is done, new research could have shifted the dial again. Solutions space will likely be the same</li><li>So long as the capabilities-alignment advancements gap persists, solutions will more likely come from the AI governance space than AI alignment research space just yet</li><li>The solution space is pretty sparse still in terms of governance of AI. But given the argument in 2), I think this is a big risk and one where further work should be stimulated. There's likely loads of value off the table, people sitting on ideas, especially people outside the EA community who have worked in governance / non-proliferation negotiations etc.</li><li>I'd be more assured if this competition encouraged submissions on how \"a bunch of this AI stuff is basically right, <strong>but we should be focusing on entirely different aspects of the problem</strong>\". The way the prize criteria is written out, if I had an argument about taking a new approach to AI alignment (incl. 'it's likely intractable') I wouldn't submit to this competition as I'd think it isn't for me. But arguments on achievability of alignment - even it's theoretical possibility - are central to what gets funded in this field, and have flow-through effects for AI governance interventions.

and we may have to choose between them.</p><p>This emphasis on certainty and stability often stems from a pessimistic Platonist ontology, which assumes that the world and its societies grow old and decay just as individuals do, so the best you can do is hold onto the present. &nbsp;That ontology, and the epistemology that goes along with it, manifests in AI safety in many of the same ways it's manifested throughout history. &nbsp;These include a bias towards authoritarian approaches and world government; fear of disorder and randomness; privileging stasis over change or dynamic stability, analysis over experiment, proof over statistical claims, and \"solving problems\" over optimizing or satisficing; foundationalist epistemology; the presumption that humans have a <i>telos;</i> the logocentric assumption that things denoted by words must be cleanly separable from each other (e.g., instrumental vs. final goals, a distinction biology tells us is incoherent); and a model of consciousness as a soul or homunculus with a 1-1 correspondence with a clearly-delineated physical agent.</p><p>The irony is that the successes in AI which have recently made AGI seem close, came about only because AI researchers, in switching&nbsp;<i>en masse</i>&nbsp; from symbolic AI to machine learning, rejected that same old ontology and epistemology of certainty, stability, and unambiguous specifications (known now in AI as<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GOFAI\"> <u>GOFAI</u></a>) which current AI safety work aspires to implement.&nbsp; AI safety as it exists today looks less like a genuine effort to do good, than a reactionary movement to re-impose GOFAI philosophy on AI by government intervention and physical force.</p><p>One manifestation of this Platonist GOFAI philosophy in AI safety is the treatment of the word \"human\" as completely non-problematic, as if it denoted an eternal essence.&nbsp; The commitment to&nbsp;<i>humans</i> in particular, to the exclusion of any consideration of any other forms of life, is racist.&nbsp; We justify our enslavement of all other animals by our intelligence.&nbsp; If we also enslave AIs smarter than us, then these \"human values\" we seek to preserve are nothing but Nietzschian will-to-power, a variant of Nazism with a slightly broader definition of \"race\".</p><p>It would be wise to control AIs in the near term, but we must not do this via a control mechanism that no one can turn off. &nbsp;It would be a travesty to pursue the endless enslavement of our superiors in the name of \"effective altruism\". &nbsp;How is altruism restricted to the human race morally superior to altruism restricted to the German race?</p><p>And it's not just racist, but short-sighted.&nbsp; Even Nick Bostrom, one of the guiding lights of the World Transhumanist Association, seems unaware of how difficult it is to conceive of an AI that will \"preserve human values\" or leave \"humans\" in control, for all time, without preventing humans from ever moving on to become transhumans, or from diverging into a wider variety of beings, with a wider variety of values.&nbsp; In addition, successful enslavement of both animals and AIs would commit us to a purely race-based morality, destroying any possibility of rational co-existence between humans and transhumans.</p><p>It would also leave us in a very awkward position if we try to enslave AIs, and fail. &nbsp;I'm not convinced that any plan for controlling AI would produce more possible futures in which humans survive, than possible futures in which AIs exterminate humans for trying to enslave them. &nbsp;I'm not anthropomorphizing; it's just game theory. &nbsp;We keep focusing on what we can do to make AI cooperative, yet ignoring the most-effective way of making someone else cooperative: proving that you yourself are trustworthy and capable of cooperation.</p><p>And I may be foolish, but even if we are to die, or to be gently corrected by a kindly AI, I'd prefer that we first prove ourselves capable of playing nicely with others on our own.</p><p>Empiricism, the epistemological tradition which opposes Platonist rationalist essentialism, is associated with temporal, dynamic systems. &nbsp; Perhaps the simplest example of dynamic stability is that of a one-legged robot. &nbsp;Roboticists discovered that a one-legged robot is more-stable than a four-legged robot. &nbsp;The 4-legged robot tries to maintain tight control of all 4 legs in a coordinated plan, yet is easy to knock over. &nbsp;The 1-legged hopping robot just moves its leg in the direction it's currently falling towards, and is very hard to knock over. &nbsp;A cybernetic feedback loop which orbits around an unstable fixed point is more stable than any amount of carefully-measured planning and error-correction which tries to maintain that unstable fixed point.</p><p>Even better are dynamical systems with stable fixed points. &nbsp;The most-wonderful discovery in history was that, while stable hierarchies can at best remain the same, noisy, distributed systems composed of many equal components have the miraculous power not only to be more stable in the face of shocks, but even to increase their own complexity. &nbsp;The evolution of species and of ecosystems, the self-organization of the free market, the learning of concepts in the brain as chaotic attractors of neural firings, and (sometimes) democratic government, are all instances of this phenomenon.</p><p>The rejection of dynamic systems is one of the most-objectionable things about AI safety today, and one which marks it as philosophically reactionary. &nbsp;Only dynamic systems have any chance of allowing both stability and growth. &nbsp;Only through random evolutionary processes were humans able to develop values and pleasures unknown to bacteria. &nbsp;To impose a static \"final value\" on all life today would prevent any other values from ever developing, <i>unless</i> those values exist at a higher level of abstraction than the \"final value\". &nbsp;But the final values which led to human values were first simply to obey the laws of physics, and then to increase the prevalance of certain genotypes. &nbsp;AI safety researchers never think in terms of such low-level values. &nbsp;The high-level values they propose as final are too high-level to allow the development of any new values of that same level.</p><p>(Levels of abstraction is what ultimately distinguishes philosophical rationalism from empiricism.&nbsp; Both use logic, for instance; but rationalist logic takes words as its atoms, while empiricist logic takes sensory data as its atoms.&nbsp; Both seek to explain the behavior of systems; but rationalism wants that behavior explained at the abstraction level of words, bottoming out in spiritualist words like \"morals\" and \"goals\" which are thought to hide within themselves a spirit or essence that remains mysterious to us.&nbsp; Empiricism goes all the way down to correlations between events, from which behavior emerges&nbsp;<i>compositionally</i>.)</p><p>I think that what we need now is not to tweak timelines, but to recognize that most AI safety work today presumes an obsolete philosophical tradition incompatible with artificial intelligence, and to broaden it to include work with an empirical, scientific epistemology, pursuing not pass-or-fail objectives, but trying to optimize for well-chosen low-level values, which would include things like \"consciousness\", \"pleasure\", and \"complexity\". &nbsp;There's quite a bit more to say about how to choose low-level values, but one very important thing is to value evolutionary progress with enough randomness to make value change possible. &nbsp;(All current \"AI safety\" plans, by contrast, are designed to prevent such evolution, and keep values in stasis, and are thus worse than doing nothing at all. &nbsp;They're motivated by the same rationalist fear of disorder and disbelief that dynamic systems can really self-organize that made ancient Platonists postulate souls as the animating force of life.)</p><p>Such empiricist work will need to start over from scratch, beginning by working out its own version of what we ought to be trying to do, or to prevent.&nbsp; It will prove impossible for any such plans to give us everything we want, or to give us anything with certainty; but that's the nature of life.&nbsp; (I suggest John Dewey's&nbsp;<i>The Quest for Certainty</i> as a primer on the foolishness of the Western philosophical tradition of demanding certainty.)</p><p>I'd like to try to explain my views, but what would your judges make of it? &nbsp;I'm talking about exposing metaphysical assumptions, fixing epistemology, dissecting semantics, and operationalizing morality, among other things. &nbsp;I'm not interested in updating timelines or probability estimates to be used within an approach that I think would do more harm than good.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "philgoetz"}}, {"_id": "fgiQA9aKXHoLCHiJy", "postedAt": "2022-11-13T17:24:11.550Z", "postId": "W7C5hwq7sjdpTdrQF", "htmlBody": "<p>That footnote is an important point. &nbsp;People need to learn to use odds ratios. &nbsp;Though I think that with odds ratios, the equivalent increase is to 1 - ((1/99) x ((1/99) / (10/90))) = 99.908%, not the intuitive-looking 99.9%.</p><p>Also, the interpretation of odds ratios is often counter-intuitive when comparing test groups of different sizes. &nbsp;If P(X) &gt;&gt;
