For example, a sense that chapters are much more likely to get funding, attention, etc, from movement building organizations if they are more far future focused. I think chapters can of course run without any support of any major organization, but the culture of chapters will change if support is more conditional over the long term. As far as I know, no one has been specifically told not to run a chapter based on a different cause focus and I agree this is not the reason most groups start (but it can be a big difference in which groups grow).</p>\n<p>Tightly controlled also is in reference to what competing chapter building / movement building organizations would go through to work in the space.

My worry is that making any hard rules for what counts as representative may do more harm than good, if only due to deep (rational) disagreements that may arise on any particular issue. The example Michael mentions is a case in point: for instance, while I may not necessarily disagree that research on AI safety is worthy of pursuit (though see <a href=\"https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=10155225415057143&amp;id=722677142\">the disagreements between Yann LeCun, the head of AI research at Facebook with Bostrom's arguments</a>), I find the transparency of the criteria used by EA organizations to make decisions which projects to fund unsatisfactory, to the point of endangering the EA movement and is reputation when it comes to the claim that EA is about <em>effective</em> paths of reducing suffering. The primary problem here, as <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1l6/how_effective_and_efficient_is_the_funding_policy/\">I argued in this post</a> is that it remains unclear why the currently funded projects should count as effective and efficient scientific research.</p>\n<p>In view of this, I find it increasingly frustrating to associate myself with the EA movement and its recent development, especially since the issue of efficiency of scientific research is the very topic of my own research. The best I can do is to treat this as an issue of a peer disagreement, where I keep it open that I might be wrong after all. However, this also means we have to keep an open dialogue since either of the sides in the disagreement may turn out to be wrong, but this doesn't seem easy. For instance, as soon as I mention any of these issues on this forum, a few downvotes tend to pop up, with no counterargument provided (edit: this current post ironically turned out to be another case in point ;)</p>\n<p>So altogether, I'm not sure I feel comfy associating myself with the EA community, though I indeed deeply care about the idea of effective charity and effective reduction of suffering. And introducing a rule-book which would claim, for instance, that EAs support the funding of research on of AI safety would make me feel just as uncomfy, not because of this idea in principle, but because of its current execution.</p>\n<p>EDIT: Just wanted to add that the proposal for community-building organizations to strive for cause indifference sounds like a nice solution.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "PmfWK9ciHt2xY7rrP", "user": {"username": "Dunja"}}, {"_id": "itbX6bSBwgoh7ytA7", "postedAt": "2018-08-04T02:17:19.574Z", "postId": "2qGL7FoTEZTwp38ij", "htmlBody": "<p>Joey, thanks for your post!

I can also envision a new career advice organization that provides people interested in global poverty and animal suffering with coaching by people very familiar with and experienced in those areas. (80,000 Hours has problem profiles, career reviews, and interviews related to both of those areas, but their coaching seems to focus primarily on other areas.)

The impact of such changes is much easier to assess than the impact of the research in an area that concerns risks which are extremely hard to predict.

I\u2019d need to check with the rest of the advisors before sharing their names.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "XkLZMr997YD8oCrPz", "user": {"username": "AmyLabenz"}}, {"_id": "Ja3zWCSDcZeWRN5pQ", "postedAt": "2018-08-10T15:23:29.937Z", "postId": "2qGL7FoTEZTwp38ij", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you for the explanation.

I fully agree: if we are convinced it is essential that we act now to counter existential risks, we must definitely do that.</p>\n<p>My question is more theoretical (feel free to not continue the exchange if you find this less interesting). Imagine we lived in a world just like ours but where the development of AI, global pandemics, etc. are just not possible: for whatever reason, those huge risks are just not there. An argument in favour of weighting the long-term future heavily could still be valid (there could be many more people alive in the future and therefore a great potential for either flourishing or suffering). But how should we weight that against the responsibility to help people alive today, since we are the only ones who can do it (future generations will not be able to replace us in that role)?</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "w6tff8su6honZjP8j", "user": {"username": "pmelchor"}}, {"_id": "8FjeyMymm5Zt8EWpj", "postedAt": "2018-08-15T18:03:42.541Z", "postId": "2qGL7FoTEZTwp38ij", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>Imagine we lived in a world just like ours but where the development of AI, global pandemics, etc. are just not possible: for whatever reason, those huge risks are just not there</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If that was the only change our century would still look special with regard to the possibility of lasting changes short of extinction, e.g. as discussed in this posts by <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/5czcpvqZ4RH7orcAa/a-proposed-adjustment-to-the-astronomical-waste-argument\">Nick Beckstead</a>. There is also the astronomical waste argument: delay in interstellar colonization by 1 year means losing out on all the galaxies reachable (before separation by the expansion of the universe) by colonization begun in year n-1 instead of n. The population of our century is vanishingly small compared to future centuries, so the ability of people today to affect the colonized volume is accordingly vastly greater on a per capita basis, and the loss of reachable galaxies to delayed colonization is irreplaceable as such.  </p>\n<p>So we would still be in a very special and irreplaceable position, but less so.</p>\n<p>For our low-population generation to really not be in a special position, especially per capita, it would have to be the case that none of our actions have effects on much more populous futures as a whole. That would be very strange, but if it were true then there wouldn't be any large expected impacts of actions on the welfare of future people.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But how should we weight that against the responsibility to help people alive today, since we are the only ones who can do it (future generations will not be able to replace us in that role)?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I'm not sure I understand the scenario. This sounds like a case where an action to do X makes no difference because future people will do X (and are more numerous and richer). In terms of Singer's drowning child analogy, that would be like a case where many people are trying to save the child and extras don't make the child more likely to be saved, i.e. extra attempts at helping have no counterfactual impact. In that case there's no point in helping (although it may be worth trying if there is enough of a chance that extra help will turn out to be necessary after all).</p>\n<p>So we could consider a case where there are many children in the pond, say 20, and other people are gathered around the pond and will save 10 without your help, but 12 with your help. There are also bystanders who won't help regardless. However, there is also a child on land who needs CPR, and you are the only one who knows how to provide it. If you provide the CPR instead of pulling children from the pond, then 10+1=11 children will be saved instead of 12. I think in that case you should save the two children from drowning instead of the one child with CPR, even though your ability to help with CPR is more unique, since it is less effective.</p>\n<p>Likewise, it seems to me that if we have special reason to help current people at the expense of much greater losses to future generations, it would be because of flow-through effects, or some kind of partiality (like favoring family over strangers), or some other reason to think the result is good (at least by our lights), rather than just that future generations cannot act now (by the same token, billions of people could but don't intervene to save those dying of malaria or suffering in factory farms today).</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "rF7JEp6n2nX9YXMCJ", "user": {"username": "CarlShulman"}}, {"_id": "SbPtbWFAxwee4LJK8", "postedAt": "2018-11-04T11:05:55.456Z", "postId": "2qGL7FoTEZTwp38ij", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Amy, is there any progress in terms of presenting who is on the advisory boards?
