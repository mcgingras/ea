I guess quite some people working on these labs think digital minds will become a reality in the next few decades, and some even say they would work on it if timelines were not so short, so it is a little surprising the labs are not more vocal about it.</p><blockquote><p>Moves in this direction by the more ethically oriented developers like Anthropic and OpenAI</p></blockquote><p>Nitpick. I thought Anthropic and Google Deepmind were the 2 most ethical developers among them and OpenAI.</p><blockquote><p>Promisingly, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/24797GSDR_report_2019.pdf\"><u>2019 UN Global Sustainable Development Report</u></a> did identify animal welfare as a key missing issue in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs, and various advocacy groups are campaigning for an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sdg18.org/\"><u>additional SDG focussed on eliminating animal exploitation</u></a>.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://sdg18.org/\">SDG 18</a> (zero animal exploitation) looks like a great initiative.

I agree that this is of astronomical importance, especially when you consider all the wild animal suffering that would continue in our absence.</p><p>Many things that would move us toward animal-inclusive AI would also help move us away from extinction risks. But I suspect the majority of those things, while helpful, would not be among the <i>most</i> helpful ways to reduce extinction risk. In other words, we should be wary <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/omoZDu8ScNbot6kXS/beware-surprising-and-suspicious-convergence\">suspicious convergence</a>; \"what is best for one thing is usually not the best for something else.\"</p><p>I'm working on plans to do more to support a rigorous search for approaches to animal-inclusive AI (or approaches to advancing wild animal welfare science broadly) that would also rank among the most promising ways to reduce human extinction risk from AI. In the meantime, I'd encourage anyone interested in the broader subject to consider this narrower subset, and to reach out to me if they're excited to work on it more (cameronms@wildanimalinitiative.org).</p><p>To be clear, I also think animal-inclusive AI is worth pursuing for its own sake (i.e., working on animal-inclusive AI seems likely to be among the most impactful things you can do to make the world a better place in the set of scenarios where humans don't go extinct), and I'd be excited to see work on most of the approaches discussed above. In those cases -- especially when building coalitions with people who might have different priorities -- I think it's useful to be transparent about the fact that what we're doing is important, but we don't think it's one of the most promising ways to avoid human extinction.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Cameron_Meyer_Shorb"}}, {"_id": "b2ML7Yf5DgsDSgAWK", "postedAt": "2023-12-21T18:28:15.090Z", "postId": "2cZAzvaQefh5JxWdb", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>I'm working on plans to do more to support a rigorous search for approaches to animal-inclusive AI (or approaches to advancing wild animal welfare science broadly) that would also rank among the most promising ways to reduce human extinction risk from AI.</p></blockquote><p>Interesting!
