To stick with the Open Phil example, it's not just the max they are willing to fund, it\u2019s the counterfactual of their last donated dollar. For example, if one AR charity takes say x2 what it could run off (focusing on output per person vs frugalness) you would have to factor that counterfactual 50% of the donation going to the last charity that Lewis ends up funding with Open Phil (or maybe the last in that given year). In either of those situations the counterfactuals are definitely not 0. For example, say I personally would be 25% more effective if I was paid 50k vs 100k (x2 salary). I would have to assume my project is x4 better than the counterfactual project Lewis donates to otherwise. This could be true for one AR charity vs another, but I would say it's far from obvious and I will also note I would be quite surprised if the personal gains are that high in most cases of increased salaries, but would be super keen on more data on this. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "vMvhJYev2NzWwTGXY", "user": {"username": "Joey"}}, {"_id": "nJx77ERMNW8AyeB9D", "postedAt": "2018-05-06T06:13:26.812Z", "postId": "H38METsWhPwAXp7RC", "htmlBody": "<p>I'd agree that you would have to assume that your project is 4x more efficient on the marginal dollar.

I think it's the experience of some the message of EA combined with a call for dedication can be so overwhelming many people feel compelled to do more than they can; burn out; and feel dejected enough by their self-perception of failure they can't summon as much dedication as they did before. Unfortunately, as you point out, de-emphasizing dedication doesn't lead to effective altruists dedicated at all times as much as they can be in a sustainable manner, but effective altruists who aren't dedicated once the clock at the office is up. Now that EA has been around for a few years, and even if it were slowing down (which it isn't), it'd be around for a while longer. So we can take a longer-term view of investing resources into individual effective altruists. I don't think dedication is fixed: newcomers to EA don't come in with either a level of dedication we can work with, or not, and that's the end of it. Given we can expect some individuals to be dedicated to community projects indefinitely, we can foster a growth of dedication in effective altruists. I think to prevent outcomes like burnout in fostering increased dedication, it's the responsibility of existing community members to create an evidence-based tool-kit for how to do so. Currently we don't have either of those two evidence-based tool-kits (they're two separate tool-kits), but that might because not enough effective altruists were interested in creating them. Pushing 'excited altruism' over 'dedicated altruism' often seems motivated by PR concerns of not being offputting to newcomers, but that's based on assumptions of what kinds of people we should be reaching out to to bring into the movement in the first place. Of all the pieces written cautioning against both the appearance and reality of over-exertion in EA, I think the best is <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/n8/a_defense_of_normality/\">A Defense of Normality</a> by Eric Herboso. A difference between Eric's post and others is his comes from a motivation of both fostering dedication <em>and</em> caring about the sustainable, long term well-being of individual community members, so that dedication and the work those effective altruists do is itself sustainable. This is unlike other motivations to de-emphasize dedication in EA, as you mentioned above:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>What topics that are researched in an organization. Does it lean more towards what the researchers find fun or towards what will help the most people?</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Management choices. Does one hire/fund someone they are friends with or do they hire/fund the strongest applicant chosen by more objective criteria?</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<ul>\n<li>Strategic direction. Does the person point their organization in a direction that might be higher impact but less personally or organizationally prestigious?</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>At the time Eric wrote his post, <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/n8/a_defense_of_normality/4vz\">Peter Hurford and others commented</a> the level of dedication Eric was observing was to a degree past which we'd see diminishing marginal returns to productivity and also health and well-being were (some) effective altruists were to dedicate themselves as much as the picture Eric was painting. It might be the case Eric was observing other effective altruists personally over-correcting to make up for what they saw as a decline in the average level of dedication in the community. De-emphasizing dedication in EA on shortsighted grounds doing what's more comfortable, fun or prestigious, even if it's not the best plan for how to do the most good from whatever perspective, is the problem to solve. Making EA based on appearances of drawing in people who want to feel comfortable, fun or prestigious, without too much dedication, may be what's drawing in people who who aren't willing to up their dedication when EA stops being fun, comfortable or prestigious. They may not want to become more dedicated, because when they joined the movement they were told they wouldn't have to be. </p>\n<p>Having been a past moderator for the EA Peer Support group on Facebook, and a long-time community organizer, I've seen the toll in hundreds of effective altruists of being sent the mixed message of dedicating yourself while doubting everything you're doing but doing so in a self-effacing way so it's not offputting to potentially anyone else. I'd like to construct effective, robust evidence-based tool-kits for both fostering a growth in dedication and long-term sustainable self-care which suits the unique demands of effective altruism.

But if we see dedication as a consequence, something that happens when specific elements are present, then we can focus on these elements. To find which ones influence dedication the most, we should look at the science of dedication (anyone?), but one simple concept we could use is Ikigai (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai)\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikigai)</a>. According to the Ikigai concept, doing something for the world is only one piece of the dedication puzzle.

Recommendations could include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>\u201cWhat you love\u201d circle: let\u2019s find more people who love the things that should be done (by doing more/different outreach, and by showing the fun aspects of impactful careers).</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>\u201cWhat you are good at\u201d circle: let\u2019s find more people who are good at those things (e.g. headhunting) and let\u2019s provide training for those who need it.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>\u201cWhat the world needs\u201d circle: let\u2019s identify more ways to have positive impact.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>\u201cWhat you can be paid for\u201d: let's fund more projects.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In summary, by considering dedication as an emergent feature, we could optimize for it by acting on its causes rather than by trying to convince people of its importance (which I think is way harder to do).</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "FlorentBerthet"}}, {"_id": "5Xxkttpw8f3HvWQq7", "postedAt": "2018-05-08T06:42:34.327Z", "postId": "H38METsWhPwAXp7RC", "htmlBody": "<p>More reasons for why sharing the mission of EA (which includes dedication as a component) is important in most roles in EA non-profits:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/operations-management/#why-is-it-important-for-operations-staff-to-share-the-mission-of-effective-altruism\">https://80000hours.org/articles/operations-management/#why-is-it-important-for-operations-staff-to-share-the-mission-of-effective-altruism</a></p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Benjamin_Todd"}}, {"_id": "8hn9B6FS8C2Nnucd5", "postedAt": "2018-05-08T09:10:38.611Z", "postId": "H38METsWhPwAXp7RC", "htmlBody": "<p>But should we not expect coordinator organizations to be the ones best placed to have considered the issue? </p>\n<p>My impression is that they have developed their view over a fairly long time period after a lot of thought and experience.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "jnWWDGo4CAsBQPX3k", "user": {"username": "Alex_Barry"}}, {"_id": "DJZ8xRwD7Ejz9ukQ7", "postedAt": "2018-05-08T10:28:54.471Z", "postId": "H38METsWhPwAXp7RC", "htmlBody": "<p>Yes,  but I think the current process isn't inclusive of input from as many EA organizations as it could or should be.

When I met Joey in 2013, he was interning at 80,000hours and then started his own project with Charity Science and people thought highly of him for that. Now it is not possible anymore to easily intern or volunteer at high profile EA orgs ('management capacity constraints'). Easily accessible positions still exist, but due to the professionalisation and growth of the EA movement, they're less 'high status' and therefore less appealing.</p>\n<p>The type of people like Joey who just went out and started their own projects they were enthusiastic about are also relatively speaking (compared to the now 'high status' EA endeavours)  less likely to get funding today.\nI think this might actually be where some part of the conflict about funding constraints and whether small student-y projects are worth funding or not is actually coming from - do we want to support an EA culture where we encourage young people to do random EA projects? Or do we want to foster a professional environment? </p>\n<p>I think the move towards professionalising EA has been correct, but we should be aware of the costs it has imposed on people who liked the young people dedicated person A vibe of EA in the past. One alternative name proposal for EA was 'super hardcore do-gooder' - unthinkable today.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Denise_Melchin"}}, {"_id": "ijPgnDtHv59iinSkz", "postedAt": "2018-05-10T02:52:29.031Z", "postId": "H38METsWhPwAXp7RC", "htmlBody": "<p>Good post.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Excited altruism has become a more predominant force in EA which implies a lower level of self-sacrifice.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Excited vs obligatory altruism strikes me as orthogonal to dedicated vs less dedicated.  When an excited altruist is dedicated, that's passion.  When an obligatory altruist is dedicated, that's self-discipline.  Seems like two different ways to reach a similar point.  Also, there is an empirical question here: It may be that telling people to be excited altruists creates passionate altruists at a higher rate than telling people to be obligatory altruists creates self-disciplined altruists, in the same way salespeople seem to have discovered that telling prospects they have an '<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xFr0FKnaLDk\">opportunity</a>' to buy seems to work better than telling prospects they have an 'obligation' to buy.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "John_Maxwell_IV"}}, {"_id": "Z4geTYvniY846qd4n", "postedAt": "2018-05-10T02:54:51.362Z", "postId": "H38METsWhPwAXp7RC", "htmlBody": "<p>A possible solution to this problem is to 'use up' your dedication in <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1lz/why_we_should_be_doing_more_systematic_research/\">systematic research</a> working to resolve important uncertainties.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "vqjFiKWZP3CTrWxb6", "user": {"username": "John_Maxwell_IV"}}, {"_id": "qGPDQHov4TqcBo3sn", "postedAt": "2018-08-23T18:28:20.733Z", "postId": "H38METsWhPwAXp7RC", "htmlBody": "<p>I believe there is a threshold difference between passionate and self-disciplined EAs.
