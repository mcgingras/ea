In any case, the scale of the welfare of farmed insects being lower does not mean we should not try to mitigate it.

So, since humans have historically caused deforestation, and deforested areas have less terrestrial arthropods, I can see why humans have decreased the population of terrestrial arthropods. However, forest area is now increasing in many countries.

I think those animals will dominate your calculations, the way you're doing them. And their deaths could involve intense pain and perhaps only a very small share live more than a week.

Second, the reason why such a self-model evolved in the brains of complex animals, is that it serves the useful role of modeling attention.</p></blockquote><p><br>I would also go a bit further to claim that it's \"rich\" illusions, not \"sparse\" illusions, that matter here. <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13164-021-00537-6\">Shabasson, 2021</a> gives a nice summary of <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10670-019-00204-4\">Kammerer, 2019</a>, where this distinction is made:</p><blockquote><p>According to Kammerer, the illusion of phenomenal consciousness must be a rich illusion because of its strength. It persists regardless of what an agent might come to believe about the reality (or unreality) of phenomenal consciousness. By contrast, a sparse illusion such as the headless woman illusion quickly loses its grip on us once we come to believe it is an illusion and understand how it is generated. Kammerer criticizes Dennett\u2019s and Graziano\u2019s theories for being sparse-illusion views (2019c: 6\u20138).</p></blockquote><p>The example rich optical illusion given is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCller-Lyer_illusion\">M\u00fcller\u2013Lyer illusion.</a> It doesn't matter if you just measured the lines to show they have the same length: once you look at the original illusion again (at least without extra markings or rulers to make it obvious that they are the same length), one line will still look longer than the other.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On a practical and more theory-neutral or theory-light approach, we can also distinguish between conscious and unconscious perception in humans, e.g. with <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blindsight\">blindsight</a> and other responses to things outside awareness. Of course, it's possible the \"unconscious\" perception is actually conscious, just not accessible to the higher-order conscious process (conscious awareness/attention), but there doesn't seem to be much reason to believe it's conscious at all. Furthermore, the generation of consciousness illusions below awareness seems more costly compared to only generating them at the level of which we are aware, because most of the illusions would be filtered out of awareness and have little impact on behaviour, so there should be evolutionary pressure against that. Then, we have little reason to believe capacities that are sometimes realized unconsciously in humans indicate consciousness in other animals.</p><p>RP's invertebrate sentience research gave little weight to <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/what-do-unconscious-processes-in-humans-tell-us-about-sentience\">capacities that (sometimes) operate unconsciously in humans</a>. Conscious vs unconscious perception is discussed more by <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/nous.12351\">Birch, 2020</a>. He proposes the facilitation hypothesis:</p><blockquote><p><i>Phenomenally conscious perception of a stimulus facilitates, relative to unconscious perception, a cluster of cognitive abilities in relation to that stimulus</i>.</p></blockquote><p>and three candidate abilities: trace conditioning, rapid reversal learning and cross-model learning. The idea would be to \"find out whether the identified cluster of putatively consciousness-linked abilities is <i>selectively switched on and off</i> under masking in the same way it is in humans.\"</p><p>Apparently some rich optical illusions can occur unconsciously while others occur consciously, though (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010027718302038\">Chen et al., 2018</a>). So, maybe there is some conscious but inaccessible perception, although this is confusing, and I'm not sure about the relationship between these kinds of illusions and illusionism as a theory. Furthermore, I'm still skeptical of inaccessible conscious valence in particular, since valence seems pretty holistic, context-dependent and late in any animal's processing to me. <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fvets.2022.788289/full\"><u>Mason and Lavery, 2022</u></a> discuss some refinements to experiments to distinguish conscious and unconscious <i>valence</i>.</p><p>I do concede that there could be an important line-drawing or trivial instantiation problem for what counts as having a consciousness illusion, or valence illusion, in particular.</p>", "parentCommentId": "wPzjAN3WFsXu7JtuD", "user": {"username": "MichaelStJules"}}, {"_id": "ZsCT73xg44q5eq9Fn", "postedAt": "2023-03-25T23:39:36.425Z", "postId": "ayxasxhHWTvf6r5BF", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for the detailed explanation! I haven't read any of the papers you linked to (just most of the summaries right now), so my comments may be misguided.</p>\n<p>My general feeling is that simplified models of other things, including sometimes models that are resistant to change, are fairly ubiquitous in the world. For example, imagine an alert on your computer that says \"Warning: RAM usage is above 90%\" (so that you can avoid going up to 100% of RAM, which would slow your computer to a crawl). This alert would be an extremely simple \"model\" of the total amount of \"attention\" that your computer's memory is devoting to various things. Suppose your computer's actual RAM usage drops below 90%, but the notification still shows. You click an \"x\" on the notification to close it, but then a second later, the computer erroneously pops up the notification again. You restart your computer, hoping that will solve it, but the bogus notification returns, even though you can see that your computer's RAM usage is only 38%. Like the M\u00fcller-Lyer illusion, this buggy notification is resistant to correction.</p>\n<p>Maybe your view is that the relevant models and things being modeled should meet various specific criteria, so that we won't see trivial instances of them throughout information-processing systems? I'm sympathetic to that view, since I intuitively don't care much about simplified models of things unless those things are pretty similar to what happens in animal brains. I think there will be a spectrum from highly parochial views that have lots of criteria, to highly cosmopolitan views that have few criteria and therefore will see consciousness in many more places.</p>\n<p>Even if we define consciousness as \"specific ways information is processed that would lead to inferences like the kind we make about consciousness\", there's a question of whether that should be the only thing we care about morally. We intuitively care about the illusions that we can see using the parts of our brains that can generate high-level, verbal thoughts, because those illusions are the things visible to those parts of our brains. We don't intuitively care about other processes (even other schematic models elsewhere in our nervous systems) that our high-level thoughts can't see. But most people also don't care much about infants dying of diseases in Africa most of the time for the same reason: out of sight, out of mind. It's not clear to me how much this bias to care about what's visible should withstand moral reflection.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>but there doesn't seem to be much reason to believe it's conscious at all</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If its being conscious (whatever that means exactly) wouldn't be visible to our high-level thoughts, there's also no reason to believe it's not conscious. :)</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Furthermore, the generation of consciousness illusions below awareness seems more costly compared to only generating them at the level of which we are aware, because most of the illusions would be filtered out of awareness and have little impact on behaviour, so there should be evolutionary pressure against that.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The generation of a very specific type of attention schema other than the one we introspect upon using high-level thoughts might be unlikely. But the generation of simplified summaries of things for use by other parts of the nervous system seems fairly ubiquitous. For example, our face-recognition brain region might do lots of detailed processing of a face, determine that it's Jennifer Aniston, and then send a summary message \"this is Jennifer Aniston\" to other parts of the brain so that they can react accordingly. Our fight-or-flight system does processing of possible threats, and when a threat is detected, it sends warning signals to other brain regions and triggers release of adrenaline, which is a very simplified \"model\" that's distributed throughout the body via the blood. These simplified representations of complex things have huge impact on behavior (just like the high-level attention schema does), which is why evolution created them.</p>\n<p>I assume you agree, and our disagreement is probably just about how many criteria a simplified model has to meet before it counts as being relevant to consciousness? For example, the message saying \"this is Jennifer Aniston\" is a simplified model of a face, not a simplified model of attention, so it wouldn't lead to illusion about one's own conscious experience? If so, that makes sense, but when looking at these things from the outside as a neuroscientist would, it seems kind of weird to me to say that a simplified model of attention that can give rise to certain consciousness-related illusions is extremely important, while a simplified model of something else that could give rise to other illusions would be completely unimportant. Is it really the consciousness illusion itself that matters, or does the organism actually care about avoiding harm and seeking rewards, and the illusion is just the thing that we latch our caring energy onto? (Sorry if this is rambling and confused, and feel no need to answer these questions. At some point we get into the apparent absurdity of why we attach value to some physical processes rather than other ones at all.)</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "7p6HwavhY3iQmp7hB", "user": {"username": "Brian_Tomasik"}}, {"_id": "cZRQYF2jnRPPYxwCa", "postedAt": "2023-03-26T00:38:16.680Z", "postId": "ayxasxhHWTvf6r5BF", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>these random particle movements could sometimes temporarily simulate valence-generating systems by chance, even if only for a fraction of a second</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I see. :) I think counterfactual robustness is important, so maybe I'm less worried about that than you? Apart from gerrymandered interpretations, I assume that even 50 nematode neurons are vanishingly rare in particle movements?</p>\n<p>In your post on counterfactual robustness, you mention as an example that if we eliminated the unused neural pathways during torture of you, you would still scream out in pain, so it seems like the unused pathways shouldn't matter for valenced experience. But I would say that whether those unused pathways are present determines how much we should see a \"you\" as being there to begin with. There might still be sound waves coming from your mouth, but if they're created just by some particles knocking into each other in random ways rather than as part of a robust, organized system, I don't think there's much of a \"you\" who is actually screaming.</p>\n<p>For the same reason, I'm wary of trying to eliminate too much context as unimportant to valence and whittling the neurons down to just a small set. I think the larger context is what turns some seemingly meaningless signal transmission into something that we can see holistically as more than the sum of its parts.</p>\n<p>As an analogy, suppose we're trying to find the mountain in a drawing. I could draw just a triangle shape like <code>^</code> and say that's the mountain, and everything else is non-mountain stuff. But just seeing a <code>^</code> shape in isolation doesn't mean much. We have to add some foreground objects, the sky, etc as well before it starts to actually look like a mountain. I think a similar thing applies to valence generation in brains. The surrounding neural machinery is what makes a series of neural firings meaningful rather than just being some seemingly arbitrary signals being passed along.</p>\n<p>This point about context mattering is also why I have an intuition that a body and real environment contribute something to the total sentience of a brain, although I'm not sure how much they matter, especially if the brain is complex and already creates a lot of the important context within itself based on the relations between the different brain parts. One way to see why a body and environment could matter a little bit is if we think of them as the \"extended mind\" of the nervous system, doing extra computations that aren't being done by the neurons themselves.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "MJcJaPKPhyptGirn4", "user": {"username": "Brian_Tomasik"}}, {"_id": "HvmBo6pgytnLhtHWg", "postedAt": "2023-03-30T00:21:46.719Z", "postId": "ayxasxhHWTvf6r5BF", "htmlBody": "<p>I'm not committed to only illusions related to attention mattering or indicating consciousness.

Others might feel that illusionism shows that the distinction between \"conscious\" and \"unconscious\" is less fundamental than we assumed and that therefore <em>more</em> things should count as sentient than we previously thought.

I think adding that higher-level representation increases the sentience of the brain, but it seems weird to say that without the higher-level representation, the brain doesn't matter at all.
