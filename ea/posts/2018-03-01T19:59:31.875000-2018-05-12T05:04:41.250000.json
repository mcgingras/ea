But as cool as those big things are, and matters of life and death for many, such achievements tend to be remote from ordinary people, and not your everyday sort of thing (or so one hopes). <em>Small stuff matters too.</em> What about the <em>little</em> things in an ordinary life?</p>\n<p><em>The seen and the unseen.</em> When I think back, so many hassles have simply disappeared from my life, and nice new things appeared. I remember my desk used to be crowded with things like dictionaries and pencil sharpeners, but between smartphones and computers, most of my desk space is now dedicated to cats. Ordinary life had a lot of hassles too, I remembered once I started thinking about it. (\u201cThe past is a third-world country\u201d, but America in the 1990s could also have used some improvement.)</p>\n<p>These things rarely come up because so many of them are about removing irritations or creating new possibilities \u2014 dogs that do not bark, and \u2018the seen and the unseen\u2019\u2014 and how quickly we forget that the status quo was not always so. The hardest thing to see can be that which you no longer see. I thought it would be interesting to try to remember the forgotten. Limiting myself to my earliest relatively clear memories of everyday life in the mid-1990s, I still wound up making a decent-sized list of improvements to my ordinary life.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-uJ4PpFLF6He5G72Dp-2\" id=\"fnref-uJ4PpFLF6He5G72Dp-2\">[2]</a></sup></p>\n<h2>Improvements</h2>\n<p><em>A few examples, excerpted from the post.</em></p>\n<h3>Computers</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Cheap</strong>: electronics prices keep falling.\n<ul>\n<li>These days, people whine endlessly online if a RAM or semiconductor shortage (something that happens every decade or so, as the industry has notorious boom-and-bust dynamics) means that they have to pay as much as they did a few years ago for something, but the long-term trends are dramatic.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>The <strong>Internet/\u200b\u200bHuman Genetics/\u200b\u200bAI/\u200b\u200bVR</strong> are now actually things\n<ul>\n<li>Imagine dealing with the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic\">2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic</a> in 1989 instead.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>VHS tapes</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li>Not rewinding VHS tapes before returning to the library or Blockbuster</li>\n<li>Not worrying about Blockbuster or library late fines</li>\n<li>Not watching crummy VHS tapes, period</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Hearing Aids</strong> are a small fraction the size, have gone digital with multiple directional microphones (higher-quality, customizable, noise-reduction)\u2060, halved or more in price, become water-resistant, and even do tricks like Bluetooth</li>\n<li><strong>Universal Search</strong>: search engines typically turn up the desired result in the first page, even if it\u2019s a book or scientific paper; one doesn\u2019t need to resort to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metasearch_engine\">\u2018meta-search engines\u2019</a> to cover a dozen search engines which each index a different tiny fraction of the Internet, or gradually building up enormous 20-clause Boolean queries to filter out noise</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Technology</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>HVAC</strong>: houses which are well-insulated &amp; uniformly comfortably warm, and centrally-cooled, rather than leaky and using heaters or wall units running constantly creating drafts and hot/\u200b\u200bcold spots</li>\n<li><strong>Showers</strong>: hot water heaters increasingly heat water on demand, and do not run out (while sometimes shocking the bather)</li>\n<li><strong>Stoves</strong> which are increasingly safe and clean, because <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Induction_cooking\">induction</a>-based (rather than the perpetually dirty fire hazards of electric burners/\u200b\u200bgas stoves)</li>\n<li><strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-turn_mower\">Riding Lawn Mowers</a></strong> are affordable &amp; common for rural people</li>\n<li><strong>Power Tools</strong> (such as drills, leaf blowers, or lawn mowers) are increasingly rechargeable-battery-powered, making them more reliable &amp; quieter &amp; less air-polluting</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Society</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Lower Dysfunctionality</strong>: crime, violence, teen pregnancy, and abusive drug use in general kept falling, benefiting everyone (even those not prone to such things) through externalities</li>\n<li><strong>War On Smoking Won</strong>: somewhere in the late 1990s, the decline of smoking accelerated and it largely disappeared from public life\u2014restaurants have gone from smoking, to smoking sections, to non-smoking entirely; and smoking in public outdoors has become rare.

Expressing even casual interest in something can be interpreted by a prospective grantee as encouragement to put a great deal of planning and work into things they hope we\u2019ll fund.</li></ul><p>We consider these challenges to be fundamental to our work. Our grantees tend to be our most valuable source of input, and are ultimately our only route to impact. Among the worst mistakes we could make would be failing to have honest exchanges with them, unintentionally distorting their work, or wasting their time.</p><p>The challenges we\u2019re tackling here are complex, and we are still far from having a fully developed approach. In this post, we share some of our current internal guidance for program officers about how they can try to manage these challenges. We hope this will generate feedback from others (funders <i>and</i> grantees) about their experiences and how we can manage these issues better.</p><h1>It can be a big challenge to get honest, critical feedback on our thinking</h1><p>By default, we do not get much pushback, which makes us concerned that we might be making knowable mistakes that people don\u2019t want to tell us about. To mitigate risks from this problem, we have tried to encourage program officers to:</p><ul><li>Build strong, comfortable, trusting relationships with leaders in the fields in which we work, in the hopes that people who feel comfortable with and trust our staff will share critical feedback without fearing reprisal.</li><li>Make clear that we appreciate critical feedback and are receptive to it. Even if we disagree with feedback, we want our critics to feel rewarded rather than punished for speaking up; so when possible, we try to make some tangible change based on feedback we receive.</li><li>Use prompts like \u201cWhat would you say if you were hanging out by the water cooler complaining about our work?\u201d or \u201cWhat do you think other people might not like about our work?\u201d or \u201cCan you give me some criticism of our work? I know there must be something.\u201d to draw out feedback or criticism from grantees and other knowledgeable observers. (When we do draw out feedback, we try to follow the previous principle to encourage more in the future.)</li><li>Volunteer criticisms of ourselves and our work that we think are valid and that we\u2019re working on.</li><li>Make a point of talking to people who tend to be more critical, including those who are too powerful to care what we think or who are just habitually blunt. We\u2019ve also found that other funders can be a good source for critical feedback.</li><li>Send out a periodic survey to grantees that allows (or requires) anonymity. (This is along the rough lines of the <a href=\"http://cep.org/assessments/grantee-and-applicant-perception-reports/\">Grantee Perception Report</a>, though we currently use our own survey.)</li></ul><h1>We risk influencing and distorting grantees\u2019 work, even when we\u2019re trying to simply give feedback for their consideration</h1><p>If we tell a grantee we think it would be good for them to do activity X, they\u2019ll occasionally come back with a major proposal to do X, or will modify their plans to do more X \u2013 even if they think (for good reasons, and based on better knowledge than ours) that X is a bad idea.</p><p>We think it\u2019s good to be open with existing grantees about what we do and don\u2019t like, but also to be very explicit about things like \u201cThis is just an off-the-cuff thought, and I\u2019d defer to your judgment; if you think it\u2019s better to go the other way, then that\u2019s my preference as well.\u201d We would welcome suggestions about how to deliver this message more clearly (or whether it\u2019s the right one to be delivering).</p><h1>It is easy to \u201clead people on\u201d and waste their time</h1><p>In our experience, expressing even casual interest in something can be interpreted by a prospective grantee as encouragement to put a great deal of planning and work into things they hope we\u2019ll fund.</p><p>Our internal guidelines for grant investigators are intended to catch this sort of thing early by requiring them to get explicit approval from grant decision-makers before they express \u201cstrong interest\u201d to a prospective grantee. This does not guarantee that every grant we deeply investigate will eventually be funded, but it does reduce the likelihood of a potential grantee wasting much of their time pursuing a project we never had any serious interest in. As stated in our public <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/giving/guide-for-grant-seekers\">guide for grant-seekers</a>, we strive to keep prospective grantees informed about the likelihood of receiving a grant.</p><p>Though we generally prefer norms of openness and honesty in communications, we often need to withhold information about our level of interest in funding particular groups and particular types of work in order to avoid leading people on. We encourage program officers to be explicit about this (e.g., \u201cI shouldn\u2019t comment on how interested we are in that, because we don\u2019t want people to plan around us yet\u201d) rather than vague or cagey.</p><p>Our program officers often need to explicitly ask potential grantees not to put any work into something, and often disclaim that they need to check with our team before they can give any indication of interest.</p><p>Potential grantees don\u2019t always make avoiding this problem easy, because they often disclaim an explicit interest in funding. We joke internally that a lot of people have heard the saying, \u201cIf you want money, ask for advice, and if you want advice, ask for money,\u201d and taken it a bit too much to heart. People ask us to brainstorm, to sit on advisory and governing boards, and insist that they just want feedback and ideas; we\u2019ve learned that these requests are often, nonetheless, effectively about fundraising.</p><p>We have found it\u2019s often a good idea to ask people directly whether they are seeking funding, and/or tell them whether they are a potential fit for our priorities over the next year or so, even when they don\u2019t bring it up themselves. That can clear the air. That said, sometimes people have been offended by the assumption that they\u2019re seeking funding, so it can be a bit of a balancing act. We have definitely not mastered this dance yet.</p><h1>Navigating these challenges</h1><p>Across these issues, we encourage program officers to adopt openness and honesty with others as a default strategy \u2013 and in particular to try to make sure everyone knows their real chances of getting funding and/or having it renewed, and what criteria we\u2019ll be using to make these decisions (including when this means sharing our preferences for how organizations will go about their work). It\u2019s a tough balance to strike \u2013 the dynamics mean it can sometimes be risky for us to be too blunt in stating what we\u2019re looking for, but ultimately we think more damage is done when people hold out unrealistic hopes regarding our funding plans, or don\u2019t trust us.</p><p>We think being honest about what we\u2019re looking for will help maximize our impact because it will save potential grantees\u2019 and our time, and will help ensure that grantees know what we\u2019re planning and what we\u2019re looking for. It\u2019s also a matter of \u201cleading by example\u201d since we want people to be honest with us. But we\u2019re not sure yet if this is the right approach.</p><p>We consider one of our major open challenges to be finding more ways to become <a href=\"http://www.peeryfoundation.org/grantee-centric/\">grantee-centric</a>: to avoid unintentionally wasting grantees\u2019 time and distorting their work, and to get honest feedback from grantees that improves our work. We continue to experiment with different approaches.</p><p>We\u2019re curious how others think about and navigate these dynamics, and would welcome comments or references to publications on this point.</p>", "user": {"username": "EA Forum Archives"}}, {"_id": "8xQDJ8SgscWBeXMzw", "title": "A case for developing Aldehyde Stabilized Cryopreservation into a medical procedure (1/4)", "postedAt": "2018-05-11T09:34:53.951Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><em>This is an excerpt from a short story contained in the paper, <a href=\"http://www.brainpreservation.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/vitrifyingtheconnectomicself_hayworth.pdf\">Vitrifying the Connectomic Self: A case for developing Aldehyde Stabilized Cryopreservation into a medical procedure</a> by Kenneth Hayworth of the Brain Preservation Foundation.</em></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;The year is 2030 and you go in for a neurological exam after your spouse notices that you are displaying mild memory loss. MRI and blood tests verify that you are experiencing the early stages of Alzheimer&apos;s dementia. This is devastating news, especially since you know what is in store. Years before you had been the primary caregiver for your mother during the last five years of her life and watched as the same disease robbed her of her memories to the point where she was unable to recall even her closest loved ones, robbed her of her cognitive abilities to point where the once proud teacher could no longer tie her own shoes, and altered her personality so remarkably that it was unrecognizable. Every year you would take her in for an MRI scan and watch as her doctors showed you the progression of the disease. Looping through the yearly scans, you could literally see the disease shrinking her brain. The doctors would verify this quantitatively: &quot;Her loss of brain volume this year was 3.1%&quot;. At the start of this grueling five year experience you had been comforted by the thought that your mother&apos;s immaterial soul would rise to heaven when the time eventually came. But in the end there was no such comfort since you had literally witnessed her soul eaten away a piece at a time in perfect synchrony with the loss of her brain tissue. Now you face that same fate and there is still no cure in sight.</p>\n<p>Even a few years ago you would have had only two options: An early exit via euthanasia, or letting the disease take its course. But your doctors now offer you a third option: euthanasia by vascular perfusion with glutaraldehyde followed by long-term cryostorage---a procedure known as Aldehyde Stabilized Cryopreservation (ASC). Glutaraldehyde is a deadly chemical fixative that is used by neuroscientists to preserve the brains of animals prior to processing for electron and immunofluorescence microscopy. Perfusion of glutaraldehyde through the brain&apos;s vasculature almost instantly stops metabolic processes by covalently crosslinking cellular proteins into a sturdy mesh. Since life is a set of ongoing biochemical reactions this crosslinking results in immediate death, but it does so in a way that almost perfectly preserves the nano-scale structure of the brain. Fixation by glutaraldehyde is known to preserve the patterns of synaptic connections among neurons, and preserve the primary structure and relative locations of most proteins. As a results of this crosslinking, a glutaraldehyde fixed brain is immune to biological decay processes and will remain &apos;stable&apos; for months, but eventually diffusion would result in the slow dislocation of biomolecules (e.g. membrane lipids) that were not crosslinked. For extremely long-term storage the glutaralehyde fixed brain is further perfused with a very high concentration of a cryoprotectant agent and brought to a temperature low enough to provide essentially indefinite storage.</p>\n<p>You are not surprised that your doctor offers you this ASC option. The controversial new procedure has been all over the news for the last few years and, after a heated legal battle, ASC had recently been declared an acceptable method of euthanasia in the state you live in. On the face of it, it is an outlandish idea: fix your brain with a deadly chemical and store it in a static state for decades in the hope that future technology might be able to scan in your brain&apos;s information and revive you as a computer-emulated brain controlling a robotic body. Since childhood you had been fascinated by the idea of cryonics, intrigued by the idea of waking up in the far future to experience its wonders firsthand, and you vividly remember how disappointed you were when you learned how difficult real cryonics was---how much damage it caused to the brain&apos;s ultrastructure. But this new ASC technique was designed to overcome these limitations by chemically fixing the brain prior to the cryonics procedure, allowing the perfusion of cryoprotectants to be performed at room temperature over an extend length of time, thereby ensuring complete and uniform cryoprotectant concentration in every cell.</p>\n<p>And the idea that you might wake up in the future as an emulated brain controlling a robotic body? When you initially heard of this idea, while watching the debates over ASC&apos;s legal adoption, it seemed patently absurd. &quot;If such an emulated brain was even possible wouldn&apos;t it be &apos;just a copy&apos; of me?&quot;, &quot;I would still be dead wouldn&apos;t I?&quot;&#xA0; But the idea caught fire among the early-adopter &apos;Silicon Valley&apos; crowd---the crowd you happen to work with. At work you are immersed in the world of artificial deep neural networks, networks that learn to drive cars, translate languages, recognize faces and objects, and that learn to play Chess and Go at superhuman levels. When your job is to build applications based on artificial brains it becomes easier to imagine yourself upgrading to an artificial substrate.</p>\n<p>You decide to discuss your options with your coworkers. Unsurprisingly, for them the idea of waking up as a fully computer-emulated brain controlling a robotic body is literally the most attractive part of the ASC idea, and they proclaim, in all seriousness, that if the technology for mind uploading was available they would immediately sign up for the procedure. You ask them how they wrestle with the philosophical implications. Again, unsurprisingly, they embrace the idea that self-copies would be possible. They even discuss how being an emulated brain will allow one to &apos;fork&apos; one&apos;s mind into two copies in the morning, live separate lives with separate conscious points of view during the day, and later in the evening &apos;merge the deltas&apos; back into a single conscious self. After hours of discussions you admit that their enthusiasm has infected you as well. You decide that you will opt for the procedure, and, in consultation with your doctor, you set a tentative date for your ASC euthanasia. You set it for two years from now, before the most devastating decline will begin.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "oge"}}, {"_id": "4FDYHJpgcbpZAawRz", "title": "Cost-Effectiveness of Vaccines: Appendices and Endnotes", "postedAt": "2018-05-08T07:43:43.262Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><em>This essay was jointly written by Peter Hurford and Marcus A.

Cost-effectiveness of HPV - Fessenfeld, Hutubessy, and Jit (2013)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23830973\"> Fesenfeld, Hutubessy, and Jit (2013)</a>&#xA0;did a meta-analysis and found a cost-effectiveness of $146 to $34,382 per QALY in inflation-adjusted international dollars for the HPV vaccine (see Table 1) based on studies in Thailand and Mexico<strong><a href=\"/ea/1o8/costeffectiveness_of_vaccines_appendices_and/#fn:8\">[10]</a></strong>. <a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/10586\"> Our model for HPV finds</a>&#xA0;a cost-effectiveness of $370 - $1600 / DALY. Our estimate seems to fit snugly within their wide range.</p>\n<p>But why does Fesenfeld, Hutubessy, and Jit (2013) have such a large range with such large values? Part of the reason for the large difference in estimations between sources and between the estimates given above are significant differences in cost estimation rather than fundamental methodological problems, as in these studies cost per HPV series estimates range from $49 to $511. In our model, if we use the more worst-case scenarios of cost per vaccine of $23 in the developing world, the cost-effectiveness of roll-out would be about $1964 per DALY while $49 per series yields an estimate of over $4000 per DALY.</p>\n<p>Since prices in the developed world <a href=\"http://kff.org/womens-health-policy/fact-sheet/the-hpv-vaccine-access-and-use-in/\"> can be as high as $400</a>, the price per vaccine used would, naturally, significantly change the cost-effectiveness. Indeed, in the United States, cost-effectiveness has been benchmarked between $4,894 to $18,447 per QALY (adjusted for inflation between 2005 dollars to 2017 dollars) by <a href=\"https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/14/2/pdfs/07-0499.pdf\"> Chesson, Ekwueme, Saraiya, and Markowitz (2008)</a>&#xA0;and benchmarked at $31,441/QALY (after conversion from 2001 dollars) by <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2873748/\"> Sanders and Tiara (2003)</a>. If our model were scaled to have a $400 roll-out cost per person, it would agree with this, suggesting ~$35K/DALY.</p>\n<p>Thus our model matches with the same parameters, but we don&#x2019;t find the same need to be as uncertain about our assumptions of cost per dose.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>A.2.) Making Markets for Vaccines - Levine, Kremer, &amp; Albright (2005)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/doc/books/vaccine/MakingMarkets-complete.pdf\"> Levine, Kremer, &amp; Albright (2005)</a>&#xA0;look at the cost-effectiveness of encouraging vaccine development for malaria, HIV, and tuberculosis. They explore the idea of creating an &#x201C;advanced market commitment&#x201D;, which is a legal commitment to purchase vaccines at a certain preset price once that vaccine is researched and developed, incentivizing that research to happen by providing a return that could be reasonably guaranteed and known in advance.</p>\n<p>They estimate a $3B market in 2004 dollars would be necessary ($4B in 2018 dollars), assume that the cost of capital (interest rate) of 8%, discount DALYs at 3% per year, assume three doses of the vaccine will provide protection for five years, assume vaccines are 60% effective, and assume a vaccine price of $15 per vaccine and delivery costs of $0.75 per dose ($2.25 total) in 2004 dollars ($23 per person in 2018 dollars). The malaria vaccine is then modeled as returning $15/DALY in 2004 dollars, or ~$20/DALY in 2018 dollars. Levine, Kremer, &amp; Albright (2005) <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/page/cost-effectiveness-tool\"> released a spreadsheet model of their calculations</a>.</p>\n<p>On one hand, our estimates are very close, which is reassuring. Our models suggested malaria had a return of <a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/10588\"> $23 - $52 / DALY if vaccinating 60% of SSA</a>&#xA0;and <a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/10601\"> $11 - 18/DALY if vaccinating to eradication</a>. These estimates are notably close to the $20/DALY given by Levine, Kremer, &amp; Albright (2005). The $3B market size suggested by Levine, Kremer, &amp; Albright (2005) is also shockingly close to the $3.17B we estimated would be needed to research, develop, and roll out a malaria vaccine.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, our methodologies are different, and this is worth discussing in light of model uncertainty. Levine, Kremer, &amp; Albright (2005) are modeling vaccinating 200M people in targeted areas. This is much larger than our SSA 60% scenario, which is modeled for ~96M children under 5 in the first year plus another ~22M children a year for every year after, and much smaller than our eradication scenario modeled for 675M people. Our model does not take into account an <a href=\"http://www.who.int/immunization/newsroom/amcs/en/\"> advanced market commitment</a>, models for a range of estimates for efficacy, and assumes a roll-out cost of $22 per person. When <a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/10646\"> we adjust our model to factor in the price, delivery costs, efficacy, and vaccinated population as Levine, Kremer, &amp; Albright (2005)</a>, we get $12 - $19 / DALY, which is more optimistic than Levine, Kremer, &amp; Albright (2005) projects.</p>\n<p><em>Malaria Vaccine Cost-Effectiveness</em></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Levine, Kremer &amp; Albright (2005)</th>\n<th>Our model &#x2013; 60% SSA scenario</th>\n<th>Our model with LKA parameters</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>$20 / DALY</td>\n<td>$23 - $52 / DALY</td>\n<td>$12 - 19 / DALY</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>&#xA0;</h3>\n<h3>A.3.) Modeling the Cost-effectiveness of Introducing the RTS,S Malaria Vaccine Relative to Scaling up Other Malaria Interventions in Sub-Saharan Africa - Winskill, Walker, Griffin, and Ghani (2017)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://gh.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000090\"> Winskill, Walker, Griffin, and Ghani (2017)</a>&#xA0;set out to compare introducing the malaria vaccine to other malaria treatments like distributing bednets. We make a similar comparison in <a href=\"/ea/1o8/costeffectiveness_of_vaccines_appendices_and/#appendixc\">Appendix C</a>. They look directly at <a href=\"http://www.who.int/malaria/media/rtss-phase-3-trial-qa/en/\"> the large phase III trial of the RTS,S malaria vaccine across 11 sites in Africa</a>, which vaccinated ~15,500 children. Per Winskill, Walker, Griffin, and Ghani (2017)&#x2019;s numbers, the vaccine had efficacy defined by a range between 13.7%-46.9% and cost $20 per child to administer. Given the observed transmission levels, they concluded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $44&#x2013;$279 per DALY.</p>\n<p>They also found a ICER per DALY of $27 ($8.15-$110/DALY) for long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs), $143/DALY (range $135-$150/DALY) for indoor residual spraying (IRS), and $68/DALY (range $62-$75/DALY) for seasonal malaria chemoprevention. By comparing ranges, distributing bednets came out ahead, but note that this may not hold as diminishing marginal returns are experienced by scaling up.</p>\n<p><em>Malaria Vaccine Cost-Effectiveness</em></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Winskill, Walker, Griffin, &amp; Ghani (2017)</th>\n<th>Our model &#x2013; 60% SSA scenario</th>\n<th>Our model with WWGG parameters (roll out costs only)<strong>[<a href=\"/ea/1o8/costeffectiveness_of_vaccines_appendices_and/#fn:11\">[11]</a></strong></th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>$44 - $279 / DALY</td>\n<td>$23 - $52 / DALY</td>\n<td>$54 - 230 / DALY</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Again, while our estimates look very different, it comes down to assumptions. When <a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/10654\"> we adjust our model to factor in the price, delivery costs, efficacy, and vaccinated population as Winskill, Walker, Griffin, &amp; Ghani (2017)</a>, we get $54 - $230 / DALY, which is very similar to their range. Winskill, Walker, Griffin, &amp; Ghani (2017) made similar assumptions as us with regard to vaccine cost, but only considered four years of benefits (compared to us considering twenty), used a technically more accurate but much less optimistic vaccine effectiveness rate (we assume the rate would get better over time), uses a significantly smaller sample population (just that of the actual Phase III trial) and does not consider factoring in any fixed roll-out costs or R&amp;D costs. Together, all of these changes in assumptions, except the last one, greatly increase the cost-effectiveness estimate.</p>\n<p>Essentially, Winskill, Walker, Griffin, &amp; Ghani (2017) is looking at the cost-effectiveness of rolling out the malaria vaccine as it exists right now, whereas we are looking at the cost-effectiveness of developing and rolling-out a future malaria vaccine that would likely reach higher efficacy targets more in line with existing vaccines and established cut-offs for minimum efficacy needed to have a viable vaccine.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>A.4.) Country-specific Predictions of the Cost-Effectiveness of Malaria Vaccine - Galactionova, et al. (2017)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X16311033?via%3Dihub\"> Galactionova, et al. (2017)</a>&#xA0;models the existing RTS,S malaria vaccine and finds a median cost-effectiveness ratio of $188 per DALY averted, though with a very wide range of range of $78 - $22,448 / DALY. Assumptions made by Galactionova, et al. (2017) were similar to that of Winskill, Walker, Griffin, and Ghani (2017).</p>\n<p>The range is so wide because of the inclusion of four countries where the predicted impact is highly imprecise due to a limitation of data. When those countries are excluded, the range is greatly reduced to between $115 and $220 / DALY (Galactionova, et al., 2017, section 3.2). This smaller range fits snugly within our model with parameters adapted from Winskill, Walker, Griffin, and Ghani (2017).</p>\n<p><em>Malaria Vaccine Cost-Effectiveness</em></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Galactionova, et al.

While they do not directly state a confidence interval resulting from this sensitivity analysis, they headline a figure of $145.03 / DALY but suggest a range of $8 - $329.78 / DALY.</p>\n<p><em>Malaria Vaccine Cost-Effectiveness</em></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Seo, Baker, and Ngo (2004)</th>\n<th>Our model &#x2013; 60% SSA scenario</th>\n<th>Our model with WWGG parameters</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>$8 - $330 / DALY</td>\n<td>$23 - $52 / DALY</td>\n<td>$54 - 230 / DALY</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>The assumptions are similar to Winskill, Walker, Griffin, and Ghani (2017), which ends making the range given by Seo, Baker, and Ngo (2004) a close match for the range constructed from the parameters from Winskill, Walker, Griffin, and Ghani (2017) &#x2013; the maximums of the range are nearly the same. However, Seo, Baker, and Ngo (2004) is more optimistic because they consider possibilities such as $1/dose ($4/person roll-out cost, or ~18% of what we project in our model) in their sensitivity analysis.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>A.6.) Public Health Impact and Cost-Effectiveness of the RTS,S/AS01 Malaria Vaccine: A Systematic Comparison of Predictions from Four Mathematical Models - Penny, et al. (2016)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673615007254\"> Penny, et al. (2016)</a>&#xA0;is of particular importance because its estimates form the basis for much of the GAVI (2016) report on malaria that we rely on for a lot of our models. Like the previous articles we considered, Penny, et al. (2016) looks at the data from the RTS,S trials. However, unlike these previous articles, they attempt to extrapolate the data from this trial to future cost-effectiveness using multiple models. This matches much closer to what we intend to do, but still doesn&#x2019;t fully match our assumptions of large potential future increases in vaccine efficacy following further R&amp;D spending prior to achieving licensing and large-scale roll-out of a future vaccine.</p>\n<p>Focusing on their four-dose model, their model captures ten years of benefits and uses a declining exponential decay curve of efficacy with a mean of ~6% - ~25% over those ten years, depending on the model used (see Figure S2.1). They also vary the price between $8-$40 per fully vaccinated child. <a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/10666\"> Integrating these efficacy and price figures into our model</a>&#xA0;for a population of 100,000 vaccinated children over ten years gives us a result of $28 - $270 / DALY, which is a slightly wider range but captures all the values found from Penny, et. al.

(2012) points to much more pessimistic HIV ranges than our estimate. It&#x2019;s hard to figure out why without digging into the underlying study, but one likely reason is simply context &#x2013; the HIV estimates in Ozawa, et al. (2012) come from Thailand, instead of SSA.</p>\n<p>The HPV estimates from Ozawa, et al. (2012) frustratingly only give upper bounds, and while they are generally more optimistic than our range, all but one of them do fit in our range.</p>\n<p>The malaria estimates from Ozawa, et al. (2012) are nicely clustered around our estimate. The reason why they vary is because each estimate has been constructed from a different assumption about vaccine price per dose. When you take the estimate that matches our projection of price per dose at $4-5/dose, you end up with the estimate that is $31 - $49/DALY, which is an incredibly close match to our actual estimate of $21 - $49 / DALY.</p>\n<p>Ozawa, et al. (2012) cites 105 different rotavirus cost-effectiveness estimates from around the world, so we don&#x2019;t cite them all in the table. Instead, we picked the estimates that were specifically for SSA countries or for lower and middle-income countries (LMIC) generally. For those who had point estimates that varied by dose, we changed them to a range. The first two estimates from SSA countries were very close to our estimate and the two estimates for LMIC generally overlapped with our estimate but were more pessimistic. This is likely because LMIC generally are wealthier and have a lower disease burden than SSC specifically.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>A.9.) Dalton (2014)</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/research-into-neglected-diseases/\"> Dalton (2014)</a>&#xA0;models &#x201C;the marginal, ex-ante cost-effectiveness of funding medical research&#x201D; as a &#x201C;problem of unknown difficulty&#x201D; (<a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/how-to-treat-problems-of-unknown-difficulty/\">Cotton-Barrat 2014a</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/estimating-cost-effectiveness/\"> Cotton-Barrat 2014b</a>), which assumes a discrete, fixed outcome (e.g., the vaccine is made) will be achieved after an unknown amount of resources (e.g., money, staff time, randomized controlled trials) are used. We model this discrete jump from 0 to 1 as a continuous probability curve over time and then estimate this probability curve with a lognormal distribution.</p>\n<p>When applying this to funding for neglected tropical diseases, Dalton (2014) considers additional funding as &#x201C;bringing forward the date of technological discovery, and therefore shifting forward the roll-out of the vaccine/drug&#x201D; to the point of total eradication and that therefore &#x201C;the gain of shifting forward vaccine discovery by a year equals the current annual disease burden&#x201D;.

(It was within the same range as our &#x201C;typical&#x201D; vaccine too, but that&#x2019;s a very big range.) Where might that discrepancy lie?</p>\n<p>Dalton (2014)&#x2019;s analysis is a completely different kind of model than our analysis, so a direct comparison is difficult. Notably, Dalton (2014) notes that the &#x201C;[c]osts of distribution were not accounted for&#x201D;, which for complete eradication of a disease is very considerable. Our estimate is this would add roughly $3.6B-$5B for vaccinating 60% of SSA for malaria, $13B-$18B for eradicating malaria, $19B-$100B for vaccinating 60% of SSA for HIV, and $180B-$960B for eradicating HIV.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Dalton (2014) also models the spending on research and development for malaria using data from <a href=\"http://www.policycures.org/downloads/04_GF_report13_web_Findings%E2%80%93Funding%20by%20Disease.pdf\"> GFinder (2013)</a>, which includes all R&amp;D spending &#x2013; including not only vaccines, but also other drugs, microbicides, diagnostics, and basic research. Given that Dalton (2014) intended to model the returns of research as a whole this seems appropriate but reduces the ability to compare meaningfully to our work to model the cost-effectiveness of vaccine R&amp;D in particular.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, <a href=\"http://www.policycures.org/downloads/04_GF_report13_web_Findings%E2%80%93Funding%20by%20Disease.pdf\"> GFinder (2013)</a>&#xA0;also uses a total for malaria vaccine research that is higher than the total documented in <a href=\"http://www.gavi.org/about/governance/gavi-board/minutes/2016/22-june/minutes/09---malaria-vaccine-pilots---appendices/\"> GAVI (2016)</a>&#xA0;that we rely on for our estimate. In total, we assume that a malaria vaccine <a href=\"/ea/1l4/how_much_does_it_cost_to_research_and_develop_a/\">could be created with an investment of $605M</a>, whereas GFinder (2013) assumes a total spend of over $3B<strong><a href=\"/ea/1o8/costeffectiveness_of_vaccines_appendices_and/#fn:12\">[12]</a></strong>, and Dalton (2014) extrapolates to a total R&amp;D spend of over $67B on malaria, over 100x our estimate for malaria R&amp;D costs and over 4x our estimate for all costs for malaria eradication.</p>\n<p>Given that in our model, for HIV the R&amp;D costs are much more prominent than for malaria, the underestimation in roll-out costs and the overestimation in R&amp;D costs by Dalton (2014) relative to our model would explain the discrepancy.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>A.10.) Dalton (2016)&apos;s Novel Model Adapted from Karnofsky (2014)</h3>\n<p>Dalton (2016) produces a novel model based on <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/blog/returns-life-sciences-funding\"> Karnofsky (2014)</a>&#x2019;s work. This model assumes that the entire DALY burden of a disease will eventually be eliminated and that new research will be responsible for 50% of this reduction. The benefits would have a lag of 50 years and require discounting at a 3% annual rate, but benefits will grow with population growth. Applying this gave a mean of $51.91/DALY for HIV and $44.14/DALY for malaria (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1B7MPlhSnGRifioy_4RCZe8tPuRtQBqSUwZ9SmeKnmeA/edit#gid=0\">see spreadsheet here</a>).</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Vaccine</th>\n<th>Dalton (2014)</th>\n<th>Dalton (2016)</th>\n<th>60% SSA</th>\n<th>Eradication</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Malaria</td>\n<td>$45.45 / DALY</td>\n<td>$44.14 / DALY</td>\n<td>$23 - $52 / DALY</td>\n<td>$11 - 18 / DALY</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>HIV</td>\n<td>$89.29 / DALY</td>\n<td>$51.91 / DALY</td>\n<td>$210 - $690 / DALY</td>\n<td>$300 - $1600 / DALY</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>&#x201C;Typical&#x201D; / Median</td>\n<td>$71.94 / DALY</td>\n<td>$34.37 / DALY</td>\n<td>$18 - $7000 / DALY</td>\n<td>$10 - $8100 / DALY</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>As Dalton (2016) admits, this is a relatively simplistic model. Like Dalton (2014), this model is hard to compare to our model as it works very differently. The dynamics are also very similar &#x2013; like Dalton (2014), Dalton (2016) does not directly consider vaccine roll-out costs, except insofar as this may be responsible for assuming that new research is only responsible for 50% of the total reduction. Moreover, Dalton (2016)&#x2019;s novel model, like Dalton (2014), uses data from GFinder (2013) that may be misleading for the particular application.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2><a></a> Appendix B: Forecasting Cost-Effectiveness for Ebola</h2>\n<p>Based on the cost-effectiveness modeling in this essay, we could consider using our model to forecast the cost-effectiveness of the Ebola vaccine, which is currently under active development and relatively unknown. We previously found the Ebola vaccine to likely cost ~$1.5B in R&amp;D and to become licensed in ~2022, but we do not know much about the relevant roll-out costs. We&#x2019;ve also estimated Ebola vaccination to potentially avert 92,685 DALYs per year if rolled out to 60% of the relevant SSA population, assuming the average DALY burden of the last five years, and to prevent ~308,900 DALYs given these assumptions if Ebola were eradicated. Assuming the much higher burden seen during the 2014 outbreak of ~1.3M DALYs per year, ~388,000 DALYs could be prevented by vaccinating 60% of the relevant population<strong><a href=\"/ea/1o8/costeffectiveness_of_vaccines_appendices_and/#fn:13\">[13]</a></strong>.</p>\n<p>Based on our model, we can create guesses for Ebola based on a variety of potential costs of the Ebola vaccine. We can also vary how focused the population targeted for vaccination is. A broad distribution of the Ebola vaccine may be highly unrealistic. <a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosntds/article?id=10.1371/journal.pntd.0005093\"> Merler, et al. (2016)</a>, for example, advocates for &#x201C;ring vaccination,&#x201D; which targets (in some combination) those who have been in direct contact with someone infected, contacts of contacts, and the population in geographic rings around them. The population in the <a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(16)32621-6/fulltext\"> Henao-Restrepo, et al. (2016)</a>&#xA0;Ebola trial was vaccinated on this basis and smallpox was eradicated in part due to such measures (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7044193\">Strassburg, 1982</a>). Also, as Merler, et al. (2016) mentions, future Ebola outbreaks in different regions could have a different basic reproduction number (the number of cases an infected person generates, on average, over their infection period), implying a different approach to be taken. It&#x2019;s unclear to us what this suggests about the population needed for eradication.</p>\n<p>We assume that our above calculations are right, that the vaccine will be 50% effective<strong><a href=\"/ea/1o8/costeffectiveness_of_vaccines_appendices_and/#fn:14\">[14]</a></strong>, and that there is a $100M fixed cost associated with developing vaccination infrastructure.</p>\n<p><em>Ebola Eradication Cost-effectiveness</em></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Vaccination Strategy</th>\n<th>Population Scenario</th>\n<th>Cost-effectiveness</th>\n<th>Guesstimate</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>Ring</td>\n<td>60% SSA</td>\n<td>$88 - $1100 / DALY</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/10611\">Link</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Widespread</td>\n<td>60% SSA</td>\n<td>$280 - $6200 / DALY</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/10612\">Link</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Ring</td>\n<td>Global Eradication</td>\n<td>$70 - $850 / DALY</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/10613\">Link</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Widespread</td>\n<td>Global Eradication</td>\n<td>$130 - $2200 / DALY</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/10617\">Link</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>&#xA0;</h2>\n<h2><a></a>APPENDIX C: COMPARING TO AGAINST MALARIA FOUNDATION</h2>\n<p>GiveWell has pretty thoroughly vetted the Against Malaria Foundation and found it to create the equivalent value of saving the life of a child under 5 for $764 to $3057 (average $2087) (<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models\">GiveWell, 2018</a>).

Thus the conclusion could be very sensitive to our particular assumptions. Notably, the current academic literature suggests that increasing bednets is more cost-effective than rolling out existing malaria vaccines (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0140673615007254\">Penny, et al., 2016; </a> <a href=\"http://gh.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000090\"> Winskill, Walker, Griffin, &amp; Ghani, 2017)</a>.</p>\n<p>While the comparison between bednet distribution and the malaria vaccine is interesting, it is unclear how meaningful this comparison is. It&#x2019;s worth noting that the calculations for AMF are likely more robust, which could favor AMF further if a Bayesian adjustment framework were used (for examples, see <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2011/08/18/why-we-cant-take-expected-value-estimates-literally-even-when-theyre-unbiased/\"> Karnofsky (2011)</a>&#xA0;and <a href=\"/ea/vo/expected_value_estimates_you_can_maybe_take/\">Dickens (2016)</a>).</p>\n<p>Additionally, charities themselves, like a charity set up to fund and distribute a malaria vaccine, could differ in marginal cost-effectiveness from the abstract intervention in a way that would undermine the comparison further and make AMF more or less appealing.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2><a></a>Appendix D: Cost-Effectiveness of GAVI</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gavi.org/\">GAVI</a>, a global organization that helps distribute vaccines, is considered to be very cost-effective. A full analysis of the cost-effectiveness of GAVI is greatly beyond the scope of this article, as the use of &#x201C;leveraged funding&#x201D; and the difference between marginal vs. total costing approaches, makes the cost-effectiveness estimate vary greatly from that of individual vaccines (see <a href=\"/ea/1o7/costeffectiveness_of_vaccines_exploring_model/#variance-and-assumptions\">our discussion of assumptions</a>).</p>\n<p>However, we can look at three sources: <a href=\"http://gsid.org/downloads/successes_and_failures_final.pdf\"> Francis (2010)</a>&#xA0;quotes GAVI as averting 5M deaths against $3.7B in funding, for a cost-effectiveness of $740 per life saved. <a href=\"http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royptb/366/1579/2743.full.pdf\"> Lob-Levyt (2011)</a>&#xA0;quotes GAVI as averting 5.4M vaccine-related deaths against $4491M in vaccine-related spending or $831.67 per life saved.

Also, some of the spreadsheet rows are exploring particular scenarios that are not necessary to consider for an overall estimate. When the Guesstimate and spreadsheet differ, the Guesstimate should be considered more accurate. <a href=\"/ea/1o6/what_is_the_costeffectiveness_of_researching/#fnref:1\"> [return]</a></li>\n<li>This Guesstimate was constructed by combining the lower and upper bounds of all the ranges of vaccines we looked at.

Note that this estimate is a mere extrapolation from vaccines that we considered (and believe to be representative), but may not be indicative of other vaccines we did not consider. <a href=\"/ea/1o6/what_is_the_costeffectiveness_of_researching/#fnref:2\">[return]</a></li>\n<li>If you calculate the expected expenditures for the eradication of smallpox, at an inflation-adjusted $0.73, for an approximate 977 million people, you come up with roughly $900 million, which is a significant underestimate of the nearly $2.1 billion the eradication actually costs after adjusting for inflation (Fenner, et al., 1988). This is likely because the eradication did not take place all at once, but was distributed over a 13 year period. To produce that figure, assuming the same vaccination costs per person, the actual the number of people vaccinated would have to have been roughly 2.4 billion. To adjust for this, we have increased the upper ranges on the population and roll out costs. <a href=\"/ea/1o6/what_is_the_costeffectiveness_of_researching/#fnref:3\">[return]</a></li>\n<li>The efficacy used to estimate the initial cost-effectiveness is low enough that it is unlikely that herd immunity could be achieved or that an eradication program could prove effective. For example, the vaccine efficacy needed to help eradicate malaria is likely far higher than the current efficacy of 39%, or the 50% guess we used to help estimate the cost-effectiveness of the roll-out of the malaria vaccine. It might need to be, say, 80% to be effective enough to suppress malaria incidence enough to make eradication feasible. Our eradication estimates, unlike the roll-out estimates, simply assume vaccine efficacy would be sufficiently high to make eradication possible. The actual vaccine efficacy at the time of any such attempt at eradication would heavily impact how many people need to be vaccinated, and thus our final end line estimate of eradication costs. For a more thorough view of how herd immunity impacts the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns see <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/52/7/911/299077\"> Fine, Eames, and Heymann (2011) </a> . <a href=\"/ea/1o6/what_is_the_costeffectiveness_of_researching/#fnref:4\">[return]</a></li>\n<li>Even if eradication is achieved, there still will be some ongoing costs related to disease surveillance and to ensure eradication, plus some continued development of the vaccine to protect against possible new outbreaks. <a href=\"/ea/1o6/what_is_the_costeffectiveness_of_researching/#fnref:5\">[return]</a></li>\n<li>It&#x2019;s unclear what the correct DALYs per death figure should be.

However, reverse engineering a DALY/death figure from <a href=\"http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool?params=gbd-api-2016-permalink/d272971954dccd2dc5db017a825e3485\"> Global Burden of Disease (2016e)</a>&#xA0;suggests a DALY per death figure of 84 DALYs/death, which seems intuitively high. <a href=\"/ea/1o8/costeffectiveness_of_vaccines_appendices_and/#fnref:6\">[return]</a></li>\n<li>Forsythe is estimating initial costs but there&#x2019;s reason to believe that the initial prices won&#x2019;t be steady. For example, the HPV vaccines currently cost ~$48 for developing countries or $13.50 for full vaccination by GAVI. Forsythe notes the initial international median price was ~$465 per patient. Even at the higher estimate of current price, that&#x2019;s a ~90% decline from the initial median price. <a href=\"/ea/1o8/costeffectiveness_of_vaccines_appendices_and/#fnref:7\">[return]</a></li>\n<li>Given it&#x2019;s a disease that is most burdensome on those of reproductive age, the population aged 15-49 may be targeted.

As for the cost per person, <a href=\"http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/sites/default/files/forsythe.pdf\"> Forsythe, 2011 </a> suggests the price of roll-out of the vaccine could be between $60 and $465.

Why do these estimates vary? What assumptions are we making?</h2>\n<p>How do we assess the cost-effectiveness of developing a new vaccine, from scratch, before anything is known about the vaccine? As mentioned by <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jmp1LQEem9E29ynSrqYrkiCsFFMrvyZLPqPl3Itdaak/edit\"> Dalton (2016)</a>&#xA0;(p13), research is &#x201C;by nature the exploration of the unknown&#x201D; and thus is naturally difficult to estimate.</p>\n<p>For <a href=\"/ea/1o6/what_is_the_costeffectiveness_of_researching/#cost-effectiveness\">our models</a>, we constructed ranges for cost-effectiveness estimates instead of point values, because there was a wide range of assumptions for each vaccine and it wasn&#x2019;t clear which assumption would be most correct. When looking at cost-effectiveness, we should consider all the ways in which the cost-effectiveness of a vaccine may differ and what assumptions are being made.</p>\n<p>Throughout <a href=\"/ea/1o6/what_is_the_costeffectiveness_of_researching/#cost-effectiveness\">our modeling</a>, we identified eleven key sources of variation and assumption-making:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Assumption</th>\n<th>How do we account for it?</th>\n<th>Overall impact on estimate</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>What population are you targeting?</td>\n<td>Not accounted for in individual models, but tested over several modeled scenarios</td>\n<td>Individual range could be off by 20 - 100% in either direction when applied to a different population.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>How are you calculating the DALY burden for that population?</td>\n<td>Mostly accounted for in individual models via Guesstimate range parameter</td>\n<td>The true cost-effectiveness may be worse than the model range makes it appear (that is, the range is biased downwards) due to this effect.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>How do you want to handle benefits that are not captured by DALYs?</td>\n<td>Not accounted for by Guesstimate models</td>\n<td>The true cost-effectiveness may be better than the model range makes it appear (that is, the range is biased upwards) due to this effect.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>How effective are you assuming the vaccine will be?</td>\n<td>Accounted for in individual models via Guesstimate range parameter</td>\n<td>Should be accounted for within estimate range.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>How expensive do you assume the roll-out will be?</td>\n<td>Accounted for in individual models via Guesstimate range parameter</td>\n<td>Should be accounted for within estimate range, but the true cost-effectiveness has some risk of being worse due to this effect.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>What assumptions are you making about the R&amp;D cost?</td>\n<td>Mostly accounted for in individual models via Guesstimate range parameter</td>\n<td>Should be accounted for within estimate range, but the true cost-effectiveness has some risk of being worse due to this effect.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>How do you want to account for changing population and DALY burden into the future?</td>\n<td>Not accounted for by Guesstimate models</td>\n<td>The true cost-effectiveness has some risk of being worse than the model range makes it appear because of a shrinking DALY burden per person, but also some risk of being better than the model range makes it appear due to a growing population.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>How do you want to handle &#x201C;leveraged funding&#x201D;?</td>\n<td>Not accounted for by Guesstimate models (models take a total &#x201C;all costs&#x201D; approach)</td>\n<td>The true cost-effectiveness may be better than the model range makes it appear due to this effect, perhaps by a factor of 25% to 100%, though a risk of being biased upwards by this effect is also possible.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>How do you want to handle discount rates?</td>\n<td>Not accounted for by Guesstimate models (models take a total &#x201C;all costs&#x201D; approach)</td>\n<td>The true cost-effectiveness may be worse than the model range makes it appear due to this effect.</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>For how many years should you consider benefits?</td>\n<td>Variation in this assumption is not accounted for by Guesstimate models.

A very wide notion of &#x201C;all things considered&#x201D; cost-effectiveness that captures all the variations in these assumptions is likely not useful, but itemizing and considering these assumptions is. Further exploration of these parameters is available in the discussion below and in the comparison to other literature found in <a href=\"/ea/1o8/costeffectiveness_of_vaccines_appendices_and/#appendixa\"> Appendix A</a>.</p>\n<p><em>(If this table is enough for you, you can <a href=\"/ea/1o7/costeffectiveness_of_vaccines_exploring_model/#takeaways\">skip to the next section on takeaways</a>. Otherwise, read on for in-depth discussions of each assumption.)</em></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3><a></a>3.1.) What population are you targeting?</h3>\n<p>The overall cost-effectiveness of a vaccine can vary a lot depending on what population you are targeting. We explored two different scenarios &#x2013; targeting enough people in SSA to achieve a 60% vaccination rate and targeting enough people for complete eradication. However, there are many possibilities. For example, one could try to target just an especially high-risk population, and this may be more cost-effective per person though help less people. Additionally, one could try to achieve more vaccination than just 60% of the SSA, though less than outright eradication. Depending on the precision and scale of the targeting and the DALY burden per person of the targeted population, the ultimate cost-effectiveness could differ.</p>\n<p>For one concrete example, consider this table varying the targeting of the malaria vaccine. We look at our estimates for our two scenarios &#x2013; vaccinating 60% of SSA and outright eradication, but we also consider a third, more targeted scenario &#x2013; vaccinating 60% of a country with high malaria prevalence, like the Democratic Republic of the Congo.</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Population</th>\n<th>Cost-effectiveness</th>\n<th>Cost-effectiveness, excluding R&amp;D costs</th>\n<th>Guesstimate</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>60% of DR Congo</td>\n<td>$31 - $140 / DALY</td>\n<td>$18 - $84 / DALY</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/10607\">Link</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>60% SSA</td>\n<td>$23 - $52 / DALY</td>\n<td>$21 - $49 / DALY</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/10588\">Link</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Eradication</td>\n<td>$11 - $18 / DALY</td>\n<td>$11 - $18 / DALY</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/10601\">Link</a></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>A more targeted roll-out can be more cost-effective by eliminating more DALYs per person but could be less cost-effective when including R&amp;D costs, as the R&amp;D costs are spread across fewer people. On the other hand, the savings from outright eradication could make targeting the most people more cost-effective, even on a per person basis. For another exploration of how targeting can change cost-effectiveness estimates, see <a href=\"/ea/1o8/costeffectiveness_of_vaccines_appendices_and/#appendixb\"> Appendix B</a>&#xA0;on estimating the cost-effectiveness of Ebola.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3><a></a> 3.2.) How are you calculating the DALY burden for that population?</h3>\n<p>The DALY burden per person can change how cost-effective a particular vaccination is, so calculating the burden correctly is important. <a href=\"/ea/1nu/how_beneficial_have_vaccines_been/\">We have dedicated an entire article to exploring that</a>. However, it can be tricky to figure out what the correct burden should be for our vaccine scenarios. We&#x2019;re trying to model the amount of DALYs that vaccines would reduce but we can&#x2019;t always use the DALY figures as of today since some of these vaccines in reality already exist and thus already have dramatically reduced the DALY burden of diseases. For example, smallpox has been completely eliminated, so the current DALY burden is 0! Thus we have to carefully rewind the clock and extrapolate to what the DALY burden would be. On the other hand, we do need to include the impact of modern trends in vaccine alternatives, like how the malaria DALY burden has been substantially reduced by bednets.</p>\n<p>For our calculations, we try to either estimate the DALYs, such as in the cases of smallpox and measles, or we try to use a range of DALYs from <a href=\"http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool\"> Global Burden of Disease (2016d)</a>. We think this helps capture uncertainty in the correct DALY burden to use, but that it risks overestimating the size of the DALY burden, especially extrapolating into the future.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3><a></a> 3.3.) How do you want to handle benefits that are not captured by DALYs?</h3>\n<p>As reviewed in our <a href=\"/ea/1nu/how_beneficial_have_vaccines_been/\">assessment of the benefits of vaccines</a>, there are multiple economic benefits from health savings due to reduced health care costs and reduced spending on combating the disease. Similarly, there may be substantial medium-term benefits from economic development via a healthier population. None of these effects are accounted for in our DALY-based modeling.</p>\n<p>Additionally, if we vaccinate enough to achieve a significant degree of herd immunity but not enough to outright eradicate a disease, the benefit of this herd immunity is also not accounted for in our models. This would likely not affect our 60% SSA estimate much but may affect our eradication estimate.</p>\n<p>We found these benefits to be too hard to pin down to be worth directly modeling, but we must note that their exclusion likely biases our estimate downward (making it appear less cost-effective than it should) to some degree.</p>\n<p>Lastly, and this goes without saying, long-term effects such as the ramifications of shifting population change, or the effect of economic development on the trajectory of civilization, are not accounted for. It&#x2019;s not clear what the impact of these longer-term effects would be.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3><a></a> 3.4.) How effective are you assuming the vaccine will be?</h3>\n<p>Vaccine effectiveness rates are empirical values that can be assessed using trials. For example, the current malaria vaccine candidate in Phase III trials has an effectiveness of 13.7% - 46.9% after four years (<a href=\"http://gh.bmj.com/content/2/1/e000090\">Winskill, Walker, Griffin, and Ghani, 2017</a>). However, vaccines usually aren&#x2019;t rolled out with such low efficacy, and vaccines tend to increase in effectiveness over time with further R&amp;D, and this effect is not fully accounted for in the current value.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, it may not make sense to extrapolate the current efficacy of the rotavirus vaccine (or other very new vaccines like HPV and malaria) as anything other than the initial efficacy. Vaccines are improved and refined in part by being actually implemented and manipulating the timing of the shots, the number of shots, and by learning from impact in a real population. Accounting for this would change the estimate of roll-out DALYs prevented since it may be preferable, in such a modeling exercise, to use a longer time horizon and some probability distributions on the potential efficacy of the given vaccine over time.</p>\n<p>Additionally, taking the efficacy of a new vaccine literally may risk extrapolating it too far. For example, our models estimate the benefits across a twenty-year time horizon, but the efficacy of the malaria vaccine has currently only been established for a four-year time horizon (Winskill, Walker, Griffin, and Ghani, 2017). It&#x2019;s possible that the overall efficacy across the twenty-year time horizon could decline.</p>\n<p>Our Guesstimates use ranges for effectiveness that include the empirical values, but with an assumption that these vaccines will become more effective with time. Some of the vaccines that are experimental and haven&#x2019;t yet been rolled out, like the malaria vaccine, have very wide ranges for the estimate of effectiveness. We think it&#x2019;s possible this extrapolation for the newer vaccines (e.g., HIV, malaria, Ebola) could be overestimating or underestimating the final vaccine efficacy found on actual roll-out due to these discussed factors.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3><a></a> 3.5.) How expensive do you assume the roll-out will be?</h3>\n<p>The roll-out costs of a vaccine are empirical values <a href=\"/ea/1nu/how_beneficial_have_vaccines_been/\">that we have estimated</a>, but they also tend to decrease over time with further R&amp;D and further price negotiations, especially as the costs of the vaccine get recouped by the vaccine companies. The roll-out cost can also be very sensitive to the remoteness of the regions being targeted, and thus can vary depending on the population being targeted.</p>\n<p>We have tried to account for these effects using a range of estimates for the roll-out costs. However, there still remains some risk that our model overcorrects for the remoteness of populations, as we did not fully research how those costs break down in our targeted population. There is also some risk that we have not adequately accounted for the declining cost of roll-out in our estimates.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3><a></a> 3.6.) What assumptions are you making about the R&amp;D cost?</h3>\n<p>Similar to roll-out costs, the R&amp;D costs of a vaccine are empirical values <a href=\"/ea/1l4/how_much_does_it_cost_to_research_and_develop_a/\">that we have estimated</a>&#xA0;(or at least guessed, where historical data was more sparse). R&amp;D costs do not decrease over time, but they decrease per person and per DALY saved as the cost can be spread (amortized) across more people. Thus vaccinating a larger population will spread costs further and be &#x201C;penalized&#x201D; less by a high R&amp;D cost. This should be fully accounted for in our models and scenario testing.</p>\n<p>What we don&#x2019;t take into account, however, is the degree to which R&amp;D costs might be double counted in the roll-out costs. If the roll-out costs include a price per dose and the price per dose is meant to compensate companies for R&amp;D into these vaccines (even explicitly so in the case of an <a href=\"http://www.who.int/immunization/newsroom/amcs/en/\"> advanced market commitment</a>), we would count the R&amp;D costs twice.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, we&#x2019;re unsure if the price of the vaccine does adequately capture the R&amp;D cost or would be sufficient to incentivize the creation of the vaccine without additional outside philanthropy. Empirically, we observe philanthropy going to both vaccine R&amp;D and vaccine roll-out, regardless of the existence of what should be a vaccine market that could incentivize R&amp;D on its own. <a href=\"http://www.cptech.org/ip/health/prizefund/files/outterson-buyouts.pdf\"> Outterson (2006)</a>&#xA0;cites research that estimates the &#x201C;cost recovery percentage&#x201D; of R&amp;D to be only 17%, which would suggest that we still should substantially consider R&amp;D costs in our model, but it&#x2019;s not clear how representative this estimate is of the particular vaccines we are attempting to model.</p>\n<p>Overall, this might bias our model upwards (making our model appear less cost-effective than it should), but it&#x2019;s not clear by how much. Given that R&amp;D costs seem to be a very small component of the model and are typically dominated by much higher roll-out costs, it&#x2019;s likely this bias is small.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3><a></a> 3.7.) How will the population size and DALY burden change over time?</h3>\n<p>Population growth proved very difficult to model, as it depends on the growth specifically of the population that would receive the vaccine in the areas the vaccine is delivered, which may differ substantially from the more general population statistics that are freely available and that we used to calculate the DALY burden. We&#x2019;re unsure how an increasing population and decreasing DALY burden will interact over our 20 year time span and to what degree each effect will dominate.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3><a></a> 3.8.) How do you consider &quot;leveraged funds&quot; / &quot;unlocking funding&quot; / &quot;crowing out funding&quot;?</h3>\n<p>So far, we&#x2019;ve attempted to look at creating rough estimates for the total pool of funding to create the vaccine and bring it to the necessary population, including some fixed cost to build up delivery infrastructure and then compared it to the total benefits. However, if we were an individual financial actor or institution in the wide web of vaccine funding, we would have to consider much more than the total rate.</p>\n<p>This might be similar to a distinction made by Dalton (2016), which differentiates between the question &#x201C;how cost-effective is it to spend an extra dollar on projects you can contribute to today&#x201D;, called marginal ex-ante analysis versus &#x201C;how cost-effective, on average, have all total contributions been to the project historically?&#x201D;, called average ex-post analysis. There are likely huge differences in the two numbers, and just because something may look ineffective in average ex-post analysis does not mean it might be ineffective on a marginal ex-ante analysis (and vice versa). Since new philanthropic investments are made on a marginal ex-ante basis, we should put substantial effort into figuring out how marginal funding might be different than total funding. Considerations like leverage help with this.</p>\n<p>A good model for this is discussed by <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2018/02/13/revisiting-leverage/\"> Snowden (2018)</a>, where we might itemize all the individual funders contributing to the vaccine and decide what they would have donated to instead, and then increase or reduce the cost-effectiveness estimate accordingly. We could then consider a dependency web of funding, figuring out to what degree some funding &#x201C;unlocks&#x201D; other funding or &#x201C;crowds out&#x201D; other funding. However, actually carrying this out in detail is beyond the scope of this article, outright impossible for earlier vaccines where detailed funder information is unknown, and still exceedingly difficult for modern vaccines, like malaria, that do itemize all the relevant funders.</p>\n<p>Current mechanisms for funding vaccines involve substantial &#x201C;co-funding&#x201D; from the governments of the countries receiving the vaccines and the foreign aid departments of developed nations. Thus private philanthropic investment (say by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation) could net &#x201C;unlock&#x201D; significant amounts of government funding that would likely be spent on net less cost-effective pursuits. On the other hand, <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2016/07/06/dont-currently-recommend-charities-focused-vaccine-distribution/\"> difficulty in finding funding opportunities</a>&#xA0;and the general perception that there is no &#x201C;room for more funding&#x201D; in this area could suggest that funding actually just &#x201C;crowds out&#x201D; funding from other would-be interested donors.</p>\n<p>Our general intuitions are that, taking these two effects together, we&#x2019;d guess overall that this net effect points more toward &#x201C;unlocking&#x201D; than &#x201C;crowding out&#x201D;, for a total effect that could substantially reduce the cost-effectiveness of a vaccine to be around 25% to 100% better (i.e., the adjusted cost effectiveness would be somewhere between 4/5ths to half the original unadjusted value) than what it would be if you did not consider this effect, from the point of view of a private foundation donor (or a private donor pooling their individual donation with such a foundation). We&#x2019;re unsure of this, however, and the real effect could be substantially in the other direction.</p>\n<p>Additionally, our analysis doesn&#x2019;t offer a way to evaluate the impact of existing vaccination charities or interventions operating given existing vaccination delivery infrastructure and commitments from governments and non-state actors. For example, a charity that increased the efficiency of vaccination distribution through public outreach would not be responsible for the costs of vaccination doses. Instead, they would only be responsible for their personal staff costs and costs spent on outreach, and thus the cost-effectiveness of that charity would not be within the scope of our analysis of the cost-effectiveness of vaccines themselves.</p>\n<p>We <a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/10679\"> adapted the Guesstimate for malaria to include a leverage factor </a> and explored some possible ranges:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>R&amp;D Leverage</th>\n<th>Roll-out Leverage</th>\n<th>Total cost-effectiveness</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1 (Normal)</td>\n<td>1 (Normal)</td>\n<td>$23 - $53 / DALY</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 (Normal)</td>\n<td>1.25 (Crowd out by 25%)</td>\n<td>$28 - $66 / DALY</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 (Normal)</td>\n<td>0.75 (Unlock 25%)</td>\n<td>$18 - $41 / DALY</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 (Normal)</td>\n<td>0.5 - 0.75 (Unlock 25-50%)</td>\n<td>$14 - $35 / DALY</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 (Normal)</td>\n<td>0.5 (Unlock 50%)</td>\n<td>$12 - $28 / DALY</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0.75 (Unlock 25%)</td>\n<td>0.5 (Unlock 50%)</td>\n<td>$12 - $28 / DALY</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>0.5 (Unlock 50%)</td>\n<td>1 (Normal)</td>\n<td>$22 - $52 / DALY</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1 (Normal)</td>\n<td>0 (Unlock 100%)</td>\n<td>$1.50 - $3.60 / DALY</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>From this exploration, we can see that leverage on the roll-out costs dominates any leverage on the R&amp;D costs.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3><a></a> 3.9.) How do you handle discount rates, if at all?</h3>\n<p>When making this model, we did not apply any discount rate to future benefits. Furthermore, we don&#x2019;t think a discount rate should be applied here, despite it being fairly standard to do so, for reasons discussed in <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/sites/givingwhatwecan.org/files/attachments/discounting-health2.pdf\"> Ord and Wiblin (2013)</a>. We hope that the lack of discount rate and the fact that we also did not consider population growth will roughly cancel each other out.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3><a></a> 3.10.) For how many years should you consider benefits?</h3>\n<p>It is not clear for how long we should continue to consider benefits, since the benefits of vaccines would potentially continue indefinitely for hundreds of years. Perhaps these benefits would eventually be offset by some other future technology, and we could try to model that. Or perhaps we should consider a discount rate into the future, though we don&#x2019;t find that idea appealing.</p>\n<p>Instead, we decided to cap at an arbitrary fixed amount of years set to 20 by default, though adjustable as a variable in our spreadsheet model (or by copying and modifying our Guesstimate models). We picked 20 because it felt like a significant enough amount of time for technology and other dynamics to shift.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s important to think through what cap makes the most sense, though, as it can have a large effect on the final model, as seen in this table where we explore the ramifications of smallpox eradication with different benefit thresholds:<br><br><em>Smallpox Eradication Cost-effectiveness</em></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Benefits Considered</th>\n<th>Cost-effectiveness</th>\n<th>Guesstimate</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>10 Years</td>\n<td>$0.79 - $7.30 / DALY</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/10645\">Link</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20 Years</td>\n<td>$0.41 - $3.50 / DALY</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/10606\">Link</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30 Years</td>\n<td>$0.26 - $2.40 / DALY</td>\n<td>See &#x201C;10 years&#x201D;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50 Years</td>\n<td>$0.16 - $1.50 / DALY</td>\n<td>See &#x201C;10 years&#x201D;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Malaria 60% SSA Cost-effectiveness</em></p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Benefits Considered</th>\n<th>Cost-effectiveness</th>\n<th>Guesstimate</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>10 Years</td>\n<td>$24 - $56 / DALY</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/10680\">Link</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20 Years</td>\n<td>$23 - $53 / DALY</td>\n<td><a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/10588\">Link</a></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>30 Years</td>\n<td>$20 - $47 / DALY</td>\n<td>See &#x201C;10 years&#x201D;</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>50 Years</td>\n<td>$19 - $45 / DALY</td>\n<td>See &#x201C;10 years&#x201D;</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The longer you consider for your benefits window, the better a vaccine will be. For smallpox eradication, the increased cost per year is considered to be ~$0 and the benefits in our model scale linearly. However, for the malaria 60% SSA model, the costs and benefits both scale with the window, leading to a much steadier increase in cost-effectiveness as the benefits window is increased.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s not clear that this consideration biases the model in any direction, making it systematically more likely to be an overestimate or an underestimate, but taking variability in this assumption into account should widen our confidence bars more than is reflected in our models. It seems reasonable one could make an argument for a lower benefits window (perhaps via a discussion of counterfactuals, see below) or a larger benefits window. Perhaps a more robust model may taper benefits over time due to other medical advances.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3><a></a>3.11.) How do you adjust for counterfactuals?</h3>\n<p>Some previous analysis, such as Dalton (2016), has looked at the benefits of funding a vaccine by assuming that this vaccine would have eventually been funded anyway by someone else, and that one&#x2019;s philanthropy is merely &#x201C;bringing the vaccine forward&#x201D;, or making the vaccine available a few years earlier than it otherwise would have inevitably been made available by someone else, later. For example, if Salk hadn&#x2019;t developed his polio vaccine, <a href=\"https://www.sciencehistory.org/historical-profile/jonas-salk-and-albert-bruce-sabin\"> Sabin&#x2019;s vaccine was just under six years away</a>. Thus, Salk only &#x201C;brought forward&#x201D; a polio vaccine by about six years. This may be a big deal to the extra people spared polio over those years of additional vaccine time, but it limits the overall impact of Salk&#x2019;s work.</p>\n<p>This can be explicitly considered in our model by changing the &#x201C;years to consider benefits&#x201D; variable to the number of years you think the vaccine will be brought forward. However, we&#x2019;re not sure that thinking in terms of bringing the vaccine forward is a good way to think about it, as any funding of a vaccine by a philanthropist now will forever free up the funding that a future philanthropist would have spent, allowing the philanthropist to instead spend money on something else potentially worthwhile, assuming that philanthropist would spend the money as effectively (or more) as you would. Thus this is not really a question of bringing the vaccine forward, but rather a special subset of the question of &#x201C;crowding out&#x201D; funding that we discussed earlier (see <a href=\"/ea/1o8/costeffectiveness_of_vaccines_appendices_and/#leveragefunding\"> section 3.8</a>).</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2><a></a>4.) Our takeaways</h2>\n<p>Overall then, ignoring the economic benefits of vaccination, the total cost-effectiveness of the vaccines we observed varies widely from under $0.50 to over $1600 per DALY. Averaging out all the values we consider reasonable, produces a range of $18 - $7000 / DALY for the cost-effectiveness of a &#x201C;typical&#x201D; / average vaccine. Further changes in assumptions and contexts could dramatically change these numbers further in both directions.</p>\n<p>In all cases, there was considerable variability both within and between vaccines based on uncertain inputs. This became especially difficult when trying to determine the historic impact of vaccines, as in the case of measles and smallpox, as there are many assumptions and decisions that need to be made in order to estimate the cost-effectiveness of vaccines across time. These assumptions can highly alter the final cost-effectiveness analysis and thus the best our analysis can do is justify narrowing the range of possible cost-effectiveness for these vaccines, as opposed to reaching a narrow answer with high confidence. We detailed a large section on model uncertainty to understand these comparisons and tried to compare against other analyses (see <a href=\"/ea/1o8/costeffectiveness_of_vaccines_appendices_and/#appendixa\"> Appendix A</a>).</p>\n<p>Overall, while vaccination does have some clear wins, it does not seem to be a universal &#x201C;best buy&#x201D; 100% across the board. Smallpox eradication appears to be one of the most cost-effective interventions of all time, but HPV and Ebola vaccination (and even eradication) do not appear competitive with current opportunities in global health (see <a href=\"/ea/1o8/costeffectiveness_of_vaccines_appendices_and/#appendixb\"> Appendix B</a>&#xA0;for Ebola forecasting, <a href=\"/ea/1o8/costeffectiveness_of_vaccines_appendices_and/#appendixc\"> Appendix C</a>&#xA0;for comparisons between vaccination and current opportunities, and <a href=\"/ea/1o8/costeffectiveness_of_vaccines_appendices_and/#appendixd\"> Appendix D</a>&#xA0;for some analysis of GAVI). The only ongoing vaccine that could appear competitive to current global health opportunities is work on the malaria vaccine (see <a href=\"/ea/1o8/costeffectiveness_of_vaccines_appendices_and/#appendixc\"> Appendix C</a>), though other considerations could potentially make some other vaccine-related work more effective (see <a href=\"/ea/1o8/costeffectiveness_of_vaccines_appendices_and/#appendixc\"> Appendix D</a>). However, the multiple ways in which funding a concrete charity on the margin may differ from the abstract total cost-effectiveness of vaccination may make this comparison somewhat misleading altogether.</p>\n<p>The desirability of funding a vaccine at the outset then seems to vary heavily on the underlying burden of the disease, but also on how efficiently a vaccine can be brought to market. If the cost of creating a vaccine is very high, as in the case of HIV, or the underlying burden of the disease is relatively low, as is the case with HPV or Ebola, the ultimate cost-effectiveness will suffer.</p>\n<p>There are a lot of additional potential takeaways here, such as general lessons learned about cost-effectiveness modeling, which we&#x2019;ll discuss in a final wrap-up essay.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Note that because of technical length restrictions on the EA Forum, this essay is broken up into three parts.

Looking back historically, we find a range of $0.50 to $1600 per DALY, depending on the vaccine. Using this historical information, we derive an estimate for the total cost-effectiveness of developing and rolling out a \u201ctypical\u201d / \u201daverage\u201d vaccine as being $18 - $7000 / DALY. The smallpox vaccine, malaria vaccine, and rotavirus vaccine may all be more cost-effective investments in total than marginal investments in distributing bednets (see <a href=\"/ea/1o8/costeffectiveness_of_vaccines_appendices_and/#appendixc\"> Appendix C</a>), especially when pursued to the point of completely eradicating the disease.

What are the costs and benefits?</h2>\n<p>While developing a vaccine is a huge accomplishment, it is not really of any significant humanitarian benefit until the vaccine is scaled up and rolled out to a significant population. Thus, spending a lot of money to develop a vaccine merely \u201cunlocks\u201d the opportunity to roll out the vaccine and the hope is that this roll-out is cost-effective enough to make up for the cost of the R&amp;D once amortized across the entire vaccinated population.</p>\n<p>We, therefore, take the following as our equation for the total cost-effectiveness of vaccine R&amp;D:</p>\n<p><strong>Total cost-effectiveness of vaccine R&amp;D ($/DALY) = ((Total R&amp;D costs of making vaccine) + (Total roll-out costs of vaccine)) / ((DALY burden of disease) * (% reduction in disease attributable to the vaccine))</strong></p>\n<p>Note here that we\u2019re looking at the total cost-effectiveness across the entire investment in R&amp;D, which requires us to also look at the total investment across vaccine roll-out too. We\u2019re not looking at the marginal investment, or the cost-effectiveness you would get if you added more funding to vaccines today, which could be a very different number (see <a href=\"/ea/1o7/costeffectiveness_of_vaccines_exploring_model/#leveragefunding\"> section 3.8 for details</a>).</p>\n<p>To try to answer this question, we previously modeled <a href=\"https://www.rethinkpriorities.org/blog/2019/2/23/analyzing-the-timeline-of-vaccine-research\"> how long it would take to develop a new vaccine</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rethinkpriorities.org/blog/2019/2/22/how-much-does-it-cost-to-research-and-develop-a-vaccine\"> how much it costs to research and develop a vaccine</a>, <a href=\"https://www.rethinkpriorities.org/blog/2019/2/22/how-much-does-it-cost-to-research-and-develop-a-vaccine\"> how much it costs to roll-out that vaccine</a>\u00a0and then <a href=\"https://www.rethinkpriorities.org/blog/2019/2/23/analyzing-the-health-and-economic-benefits-of-vaccines\"> how beneficial we can expect vaccines to be</a>.</p>\n<p>These data were calculated from available evidence about vaccines generally and also for specific case studies: smallpox (which was chosen as it was one of the first vaccines and the only human disease successfully eradicated by vaccination); measles (which was chosen as it was one of the first vaccines); HIV, malaria, and Ebola vaccines as they are modern and under current development, and rotavirus and HPV as they recently finished vaccine licensing. For each of these vaccines, we calculated how much they would cost for both R&amp;D and roll-out, and then what benefits we would expect.</p>\n<p>We aggregated all this data <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=18zUqZMrV7UvzYGXmOowSLvdS1pX5_GA8dgIxd8A2_yM\"> in a spreadsheet</a>\u00a0that makes all the calculations between the multiple sections much more clear, with a good amount of detail.

SMALLPOX VACCINE</strong></h4>\n<p>When making direct estimates using inputs from <a href=\"http://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/39485\"> Fenner, et al. (1988)</a>, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wGC8m8rYCZdIXakvHyYcf61YKeBXEWYOO7_Sjjt9hJs/edit#gid=1790767923\"> by our estimation</a>\u00a0before the eradication campaign in the early 1960s, smallpox prevented a DALY from death for ~$20-64 in developing countries and ~$1550-3800 in developed countries. Weighting this by population in each region, this implies a total cost per DALY of $527 for both roll-out costs alone and roll-out costs plus R&amp;D costs. Over the full population since eradication, not accounting for post-eradication prevention spending, the eradication campaign cost $26-70 per death prevented, $3.30-11 per case prevented, and $0.44-3.80 per DALY prevented at the rates of death and disease of 1967.</p>\n<p>These estimates are absolute as they are not compared to the cost of maintaining the 1967 vaccination and monitoring costs. As smallpox is eradicated, these figures will fall over time, unless and until there is a new smallpox outbreak or significant enough threat of an outbreak to cause an increase in spending.</p>\n<p>Assuming the pre-vaccination world would be like the pre-eradication world of smallpox endemic countries in the 1960s, given a case rate of roughly 1% and a death rate between 5 and 20% per case of smallpox, <a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/10600\">our Guesstimate</a> suggests a cost per DALY prevented of $4-62 with or without the R&amp;D costs included.</p>\n<h4><a></a>2.3.2.) MEASLES VACCINE</h4>\n<p>Assuming a very rough conversion that a life saved from a measles death is ~30 DALYs<strong>[<a href=\"/ea/1o6/what_is_the_costeffectiveness_of_researching/#fn:6\">6</a>]</strong>, this would imply very rough figures of $9-320/DALY in general, given a cost range per person vaccinated of $1-38, weighted so cheaper prices are more likely. In areas with pre-existing strong vaccine infrastructure such that measles vaccines cost about $2 a dose, the price would be roughly $9 per DALY. Given the wide range of possible cost per person, it should be noted that holding everything else constant, the cost-effectiveness including R&amp;D cost scales roughly linearly with the price of vaccination per person.</p>\n<p>Perhaps we could make sense of these figures by further untangling marginal vaccine costs from the investments needed to make vaccine pathways. If we assume a one-time investment of $100M, similar to the more directly estimated fixed costs of the malaria vaccine, is sufficient to get all lower income countries to a point where marginal vaccination costs $2 per child in total vaccine and logistics costs, and we assume that we\u2019re rolling out the measles vaccine to 96.3M people, the population of 60% of children under 5 in SSA, and we take our prior estimate that the measles vaccine cost $38.3M in R&amp;D, the total yearly costs are ~$151M for the vaccinations at ~$10/DALY, only slightly higher than with no investment spending at all. Given our earlier calculations, this would avert about 177K measles deaths or 5.3M DALYs.</p>\n<p>A more worse-case analysis assuming $23 per child, with the same $38.3M in R&amp;D, and rolling out to the same population, the total cost would be $587M at $110/DALY.</p>\n<h4><a></a>2.3.3.) ROTAVIRUS VACCINE</h4>\n<p>Given vaccine efficacy of 39-85% (<a href=\"http://rotacouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/White-paper-FINAL-v2.pdf\">RotaCouncil, 2016</a>, p11) and a reduction of diarrhea of 30-54% (<a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0904797#t=article\">Madhim et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/pidj/Fulltext/2013/12000/Impact_of_Rotavirus_Vaccine_on_Childhood_Diarrheal.22.aspx\"> Msimang, et al., 2013</a>), if we assume we can achieve a 60% vaccination rate of the under-five population in SSA, vaccinating 96.3M children (see <a href=\"https://www.populationpyramid.net/sub-saharan-africa/2016/\"> Population Pyramid</a>), we would avert ~7.5-13M DALYs per year using the 2005 DALY rate or 4.6-8.3M DALYs using the 2016 rate. Assuming an initial $50-100M investment in building the pipeline to roll out the vaccine, with a per person cost between $3-7 that would be $6-63/DALY looking just at roll-out costs and $10-68/DALY when adding in R&amp;D costs.</p>\n<p>There\u2019s great uncertainty about these estimates given fixed roll-out costs are a guess and the efficacy of the vaccine is fairly wide.</p>\n<h4><a></a>2.3.4.) HPV VACCINE</h4>\n<p>If the HPV vaccine was rolled out to all children aged 5-15 in SSA with a 60% vaccination rate and given ~780,000 DALYs in women aged 15-49 (<a href=\"http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool?params=gbd-api-2016-permalink/c3c9f8ef3f09237e684ebfbfa7ac95cc\">Global Burden of Disease, Results Tool, 2016b</a>)<strong>[<a href=\"/ea/1o6/what_is_the_costeffectiveness_of_researching/#fn:7\">7</a>]</strong> then the HPV vaccine could prevent ~328,000 DALYs per year in SSA. With a fixed roll-out cost guessed to be an additional $50M, at $3-13.50 per person this would imply $240-1300 per DALY based on just roll-out costs and $370-1600 per DALY when including R&amp;D costs.</p>\n<h4><a></a>2.3.5.) HIV VACCINE</h4>\n<p>Given estimates of a vaccine that is 50% effective (or more) and distributed to 60% of the eligible population in SSA, it would avert 30% of all HIV, saving 9.7M DALYs. Relative to other vaccines, many of the parameters for our HIV estimates vary widely, particularly our estimated cost per person of $30-160. Ultimately, our model suggests an estimated cost-effectiveness of $180-570 per DALY. Our individual scenarios indicate the final cost-effectiveness depends significantly on which population that vaccine is ultimately distributed to and the cost of per person of vaccination <a href=\"/ea/1o6/what_is_the_costeffectiveness_of_researching/#fn:9\"> 8 </a> .</p>\n<h4><a></a>2.3.6.) MALARIA VACCINE</h4>\n<p>Previously we noted that the malaria vaccine involved <a href=\"https://www.rethinkpriorities.org/blog/2019/2/22/how-much-does-it-cost-to-research-and-develop-a-vaccine\">spending ~$605M in fixed costs</a>\u00a0to unlock the ability to <a href=\"https://www.rethinkpriorities.org/blog/2019/2/23/analyzing-the-cost-of-vaccine-distribution\"> roll out the vaccine for $22/child</a>. The Global Burden of Disease estimated a yearly malaria burden of 56.2M DALYs, with 44.3M global DALYs for those under five, and 42.1M of those in SSA (<a href=\"http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool?params=gbd-api-2016-permalink/a5fdf7803b03487a8b851317d76fc5d2\">Global Burden of Disease, Results Tool, 2016c</a>). Modeling in Guesstimate, accounting for uncertainty by using a range of vaccine efficacy between 39-75% (the upper end of which is closer to vaccine efficacy for established vaccines), an expected R&amp;D cost between $600-1,000M and a cost per person between $18-25, we get an estimate of $12-23/DALY for roll-out costs alone and $13-33/DALY including R&amp;D costs.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><em>Note that because of technical length restrictions on the EA Forum, this essay is broken up into three parts.

However, I think overall the importance of dedication is underrated by the EA movement. <br><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Why Dedication is Important</span></p>\n<p><span>There has been some writing about </span><a href=\"/ea/1gh/talent_gaps_from_the_perspective_of_a_talent/\"><span>talent gaps</span></a><span> and </span><a href=\"/ea/1mz/comparative_advantage_in_the_talent_market/\"><span>talent distribution</span></a><span> and how this impacts the world. For instance, a talented person might make more and thus donate more money or do higher quality research. Likewise, dedication affects these same numbers. For example, a dedicated person might donate 50% compared to a less dedicated person who donates 10%. To stick with donations as an easy to measure example, it seems that the EA movement says to generally focus on increasing your earnings as that will be easier than reducing your spending. However, a harder look at the numbers makes me skeptical of this. If a person was making a $100,000 salary and they donated 10% they would have to compare the ease of increasing their salary to $200k and sticking at that 10% to donating 20% of their original $100,000 salary. For most people it seems far easier to do the latter than the former. Of course, in theory a person could increase their salary to $120,000 and donate 50% of the increase, also ending up at the same endline, but in practice this does not seem to happen</span><span>. Generally the EA&#x2019;s spending goes up proportionally with their increase earnings unless they have taken a specific pledge or made a specific plan of how much to donate (and the most common pledge by far in the EA movement is the 10% one). <br><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Importantly, I think dedication is an even bigger factor in direct EA jobs. Again, the weak version of this premise most would agree with. Someone who cares about animal rights will likely do a better job working at an animal rights organization than someone who has no interest in animals. But I think that even outside of the baseline caring or not about the cause, dedicated employees vs undedicated ones end up doing very different sorts of work. Much like talent, dedication can affect:<br><br></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>What topics that are researched in an organization. Does it lean more towards what the researchers find fun or towards what will help the most people?</li>\n<li>Management choices. Does one hire/fund someone they are friends with or do they hire/fund the strongest applicant chosen by more objective criteria?</li>\n<li>Strategic direction. Does the person point their organization in a direction that might be higher impact but less personally or organizationally prestigious?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>In many, if not most, of the highly talent sensitive jobs, a person&apos;s odds of making good decisions is greatly affected by their dedication as well as talent. This is particularly important if you think the person, due to talent, IQ or whatever other traits, has an extremely high expected value because these multipliers will be influencing a much higher level of output. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Of note, much like talent, dedication is a spectrum. All EA employees are &quot;dedicated&quot; in some sense, but there are degrees with some people being more dedicated than others, just like some people are more talented than others. Factors like these combine together to result in someone&#x2019;s potential to do impact. &#xA0;</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Our Current Level of Focus on Dedication</span></p>\n<p><span>Currently the movement has shied away from its more dedication-focused aspects of which there are many examples:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Giving What We Can pledge now focuses on the main pledge (10%) and the Try Giving pledge where the previously more intense pledges (Bolder Giving or the GWWC Further Pledge) have been less frequently talked about and featured on websites.&#xA0;</li>\n<li>Excited altruism has become a more predominant force in EA which implies a lower level of self-sacrifice.&#xA0;</li>\n<li>The term self-sacrifice itself is currently seen quite negatively in EA relative to how it was 5 years ago.&#xA0;</li>\n<li>Salaries at EA orgs have gone up significantly over time as well as more frequent retreats and other staff benefits.&#xA0;</li>\n<li>As mentioned before, there have been multiple posts written on the EA movement becoming broader and more accepting towards low levels of motivation with a decrease of writing about more dedication-requiring actions.&#xA0;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>There are alternative factors that also affect each of these (we live in a complex world and rarely is one factor the single explanation for anything), but I feel the average trend is pretty clear over the last 5 years (with perhaps a slightly higher focus on dedication in the last six months). </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Concerns With Under or Over-Focusing on Dedication</span></p>\n<p><span>I am not suggesting we limit the EA movement to only dedicated people, but I am suggesting that dedication should be broadly encouraged, not discouraged. I have talked to quite a few people in the dedicated group who felt judged, disconnected or almost treated with hostility for taking a more committed approach to EA. Of course there are worries about dispiriting low dedication folks as well, but I think there are also worries about demoralizing people with higher levels of dedication. There has been far more discussion of the former than the latter. It also worth noting that you end up having to deal with similar concerns talking about talent, IQ or any other characteristic that is not uniformly distributed in the EA population. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Social motivation and anchoring are strong drivers of many human actions. If our movement treats a 50% donor the exact same as a 10% donor, fewer people will donate 50% than if it&apos;s activity celebrated and talked about. The effect is much worse if people are a bit negative towards them, suggesting they should be aware of burnout and be very careful about making others feel bad. The same rules apply for 10% vs 1% donations as well. Every ethical decision will have some people who accept it minorly, majorly and not at all, and we want to be careful not to anchor our movement&#x2019;s baseline dedication level too heavily off the first pledge that got popular in it. </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span><span>Another concern people might have is closing the door to new, less involved members, but again I think this concern can be reversed as well. I know folks from other movements who have trouble treating EA seriously when senior members or most members of the EA movement see EA as a very minor part of their lives. These are the sort of people who, if they joined, would have very high levels of involvement and potentially endline impact. It&apos;s worth noting that a 50% donor donates as much as fifty 1% donors (assuming they have the same average income), so even if there are lower numbers of people in this category, they are still worth considering seriously from an impact perspective. I think one could argue the differences are even more extreme in direct work. Some people might say that this is the opposite of their concern, and that high talent people will be scared away by some members being very devoted. However, if we&#x2019;re getting high talent people with low commitment, we have all of the problems listed above, magnified by the fact that they are higher output. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>A frequent worry people have is that those less invested in the movement will feel bad if there are people doing far more than them. However, this equally applies to all levels of involvement. We would not want to stop promoting giving 10% because it makes the people who give less feel bad. Of course we don&#x2019;t want to bludgeon people with guilt, but unfortunately, doing more than the norm ethically will inevitably lead to some people feeling guilty or insecure. We should try to speak about things sensitively while still encouraging people to do the most impactful thing given their context. Which brings me to the final consideration - not everybody can be very committed.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>If somebody mentions something they are doing that is above the average, people are quick to note that not everybody can accomplish said feats. This is definitely true. However, as above, it applies to every level of involvement in the movement. Not everybody can afford to donate 10% or do high impact volunteering. That does not mean that we should not promote those actions. We just need to try and communicate it sensitively and recognize that each person has different life circumstances. However, if you are fortunate enough to have life circumstances that allow for higher levels of dedication, don&#x2019;t hold back just because others cannot. We should all give what we </span><span>can</span><span>, whether it be money or talent. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>In summary, dedication is an important factor predicting impact. It either leads to people giving more per income or making decisions with impact as the more dominant consideration. We should encourage people making impact a larger part of their lives rather than discouraging it or being indifferent. </span></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Joey"}}, {"_id": "hcH98hXCkmYRi4Dfp", "title": "Wild Animal Welfare Literature Library: Introductory Materials, Philosophical & Empirical Foundations", "postedAt": "2018-05-05T03:23:15.858Z", "htmlBody": "<p><em>These reading modules are put together by the members of the group&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/wildanimalwelfareprojectdiscussion/\">Wild Animal Welfare Project Discussion</a>&nbsp;as part of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GSqVCzsJeF_aMHjFdhaSvjaOMTk51bkYkf5dP06Uc-Y/edit?usp=sharing\">Wild Animal Welfare Literature&nbsp;Library&nbsp;Project</a>.</em></p>\n<p>This series of articles and essays together lay out crucial considerations explaining&nbsp;and&nbsp;underpinning wild animal welfare as a potential focus area for effective altruism.

Therefore, animal advocates should consider focusing their efforts to raise concern about the suffering that occurs in the natural environment. While in theory this could involve trying directly to engineer more humane ecological systems, in practice I think activists should concentrate on promoting the meme of caring about wild animals to other activists, academics, and other sympathetic groups. The massive amount of suffering occurring now in nature is indeed tragic, but it pales by comparison to the scale of good or harm that our descendants -- with advanced technological capability -- might effect. I fear, for instance, that future humans may undertake terraforming, directed panspermia, or sentient simulations without giving much thought to the consequences for wild animals. Our #1 priority should be to ensure that future human intelligence is used to prevent wild-animal suffering, rather than to multiply it.</p>\n<p>Brian Tomasik. <a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/should-we-intervene-in-nature\">Should We Intervene in Nature?</a></p>\n<p>I think we have an obligation to exercise our rare position in the history of life to do the best we can in replacing the consequences of evolution's singular focus on reproductive survival of species with a humane approach that values instead the emotions of individual sentient organisms.</p>\n<p>Jacy Reese (2015). <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2015/12/14/9873012/wild-animals-suffering\">Wild animals endure illness, injury, and starvation.

However, this assumption is wrong. Due to the most widespread reproductive strategy in nature, r-selection, the overwhelming majority of nonhuman animals die shortly after they come into existence. They starve or are eaten alive, which means their suffering vastly outweighs their happiness. Hence, concern for nonhuman animals entails that we should try to intervene in nature to reduce the enormous amount of harm they suffer.

Many are aware of the shocking realities of factory farming, or have seen terrible videos and images of animals being neglected, abused, subjected to violent and traumatic experiments, exploited for entertainment, or killed systematically in slaughterhouse lines.

And, to that end, the only acceptable action for us is the one which reduces their suffering the most. We must explicitly endorse an ethic that is in direct conflict with wilderness conservation. The wild that is conserved through these efforts has preventable suffering, so we have an obligation to prevent it. Nature holds no value in and of itself, and no value at all outside of humanity\u2019s personal attachment to it. And while the loss of something humanity is attached to certainly causes suffering for humans, it seems safe to say that this suffering is minimal compared to that of animals in the wild.

In this paper I assume two main theses: (1) Humans and (many) animals deserve equal moral consideration; this implies that (2) We have the prima facie moral obligation to try to mitigate unnecessary, avoidable and unjustified animal suffering.

However, according to the environmentalist view the aim of benefiting wild animals cannot justify intervening in nature. In addition, harmful human interventions can sometimes be justified. This view assumes that (i) certain entities such as ecosystems or species have intrinsic value, and that (ii) at least sometimes these values are more important than nonhuman well-being.

Despite difficulties of ascertaining and measuring welfare and relevancy to normative issues, welfare biology is a positive science. Evolutionary economics and population dynamics are used to help answer basic questions in welfare biology: Which species are affective sentients capable of welfare? Do they enjoy positive or negative welfare? Can their welfare be dramatically increased? Under plausible axioms, all conscious species are plastic and all plastic species are conscious (and, with a stronger axiom, capable of welfare). More complex niches favour the evolution of more rational species. Evolutionary economics also supports the common-sense view that individual sentients failing to survive to mate suffer negative welfare. A kind of God-made (or evolution-created) fairness between species is also unexpectedly found. The contrast between growth maximization (as may be favoured by natural selection), average welfare, and total welfare maximization is discussed. It is shown that welfare could be increased without even sacrificing numbers (at equilibrium). Since the long-term reduction in animal suffering depends on scientific advances, strict restrictions on animal experimentation may be counter-productive to animal welfare.</p>\n<p>Brian Tomasik - <a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/medicine-vs-deep-ecology\">Medicine vs. Deep Ecology</a></p>\n<p>Ecosystems are extraordinarily complex and require care to understand well.

Brian Tomasik appears to be the main current proponent of this view, developing the work done by economist Yew-Kwang Ng in the 90s. Tomasik has taken his concerns with wild animal suffering (WAS) to its logical limit, arguing we should consider destroying ecosystems so that fewer animals exist. This cuts against the popular intuition, frequently promoted by nature documentaries, that wild animals live enjoyable, if somewhat barbaric, lives and are best left to their own devices. As the number of animals in the wild is so vast, WAS is therefore potentially of huge moral importance. Concerned that I had overlooked the area, I investigated. After some consideration, I think the arguments in favour of there being net WAS are unconvincing. I decided to write this essay to explain why others should be similarly unconvinced.</p>\n<p>Ozy Brennan (2017). <a href=\"https://was-research.org/paper/fit-happy-measure-wild-animal-suffering/\">\u201cFit and Happy\u201d: How Do We Measure Wild-Animal Suffering?</a></p>\n<p>In order to understand wild-animal welfare, we must be able to measure it.

Alonso and Cynthia Schuck-Paim (2017). <a href=\"http://www.animal-ethics.org/life-fates-essay-prize-2017/\">Life-fates: meaningful categories to estimate animal suffering in the wild</a></p>\n<p>The study of wild animal suffering and design of putative strategies to mitigate suffering in the wild can greatly benefit from the development of analytical and conceptual tools to measure the irregular distribution of suffering within species and natural populations. To this end, we propose a new concept, that of life-fate. A life-fate is a unit that operationally aggregates individuals from the same species based on the similarities of critical life events and hazards befalling them. The analytical framework based on this concept is thus one focused on categorizing major differences within the diversity of experiences that sentient individuals are exposed to during their existence. Such a framework forces a focus on the investigation of at-risk groups, or hotspots of individual suffering within a population. Additionally, the approach can provide insights into &nbsp;potential biological adaptations evolved in response to subsets of hazards individuals are exposed to, enable the description of the diversity and distribution of suffering within species in a systematic manner, and inform the public about a widespread, yet neglected, aspect of life in the wild (suffering) based on the notion of individual life experiences and stories \u2013 concepts easier to empathize with than mortality and morbidity figures. Finally, the concept of life-fates should also prove useful to reveal commonly hidden sources of suffering in other contexts, including those involved in the production of animal-derived products and services.</p>\n", "user": {"username": "Evan_Gaensbauer"}}, {"_id": "RJr68pMkN2YfMkFnC", "title": "Wild Animal Welfare Project Discussion: A One-Year Strategic Review", "postedAt": "2018-05-05T00:56:04.991Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><span>Summary: One year ago, I started the Facebook group </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/1292009927521451/\"><span>Wild Animal Welfare Project Discussion</span></a><span> to coordinate R&amp;D projects in the network of wild animal suffering reducers in effective altruism, and as part of a</span><a href=\"/ea/1kp/lessons_for_building_up_a_cause/\"><span> broader project</span></a><span> of figuring out how to coordinate and develop causes within effective altruism. This is a strategic review of what the group has accomplished so far, and how this informs its next goals, as well as its implications for my broader model of network coordination in effective altruism.</span></p>\n<p><span>What I&apos;ve been doing with the group since its inception is running a project to see how possible it is to develop a cause with minor representation in effective altruism to the point it is as tractable as popular causes in the movement by increasing the coordination value of its network. This was based on my experience being a long-time community member who had witnessed the development of AI safety/alignment as a focus area, and expecting similar trends for other focus areas in EA could be deliberately accelerated. That is, in hindsight, we can take lessons from the build-up of other EA focus areas, and reproduce similar effects on new causes with tighter feedback loops, on a shorter timescale. Ideally, the level of development AI alignment achieved in a decade or two, other causes could achieve in as short a time as year or two. If that timeline sounds overly ambitious, it is also because it would take for granted advantages nascent causes in EA have now AI alignment didn&apos;t have in 1998 or 2008, such as the infrastructure and access to resources the EA movement has now. I started with </span><a href=\"/ea/1kp/lessons_for_building_up_a_cause/\"><span>a template for how this could be done with several causes</span></a><span>, but I started with reducing wild animal suffering (RWAS) and biosecurity as two causes with relatively well-developed networks in EA I knew well.</span></p>\n<p><span>So the product of the group is two-fold. The objective is to optimize the internal development of RWAS and welfare biology as focus areas, but the practical lessons we learn from how to do so will be integrated into a general theory for network development within EA so as to improve it. The first step was to produce a common core of knowledge so regardless of specialization coming into the cause, people can modulate how they do what they do to fit the needs of intellectual development. This is the beginning of what I see as an assembly line for cause build-up.</span></p>\n<p><span>The first cause I tried it out with was RWAS in this group. I thought it&apos;d take off for other causes just as fast, but I took for granted RWAS professionals (e.g., at </span><a href=\"http://animal-ethics.org/\"><span>Animal Ethics</span></a><span> and </span><a href=\"https://was-research.org/\"><span>Wild Animal Suffering Research</span></a><span>) had spent the last few years improving the effectiveness of the RWAS network so everyone could coordinate knowledge production faster.

No other focus area in EA has done this. Its these local variations among causes in their effectiveness at different types of tasks which I didn&apos;t take into account. Learning from them will allow effective altruists to trade tips across focus areas for how to better coordinate and organize their networks.</span></p>\n<p><span>While the document as produced can serve as a RWAS research archive, making a rubric for getting someone optimally up to speed on a focus area or cause is something which exists in the LessWrong Sequences and other knowledge canons out of AI safety/alignment which I think we have enough info to get out of RWAS. I think it isn&apos;t only about producing knowledge but organizing it right. The goal is to arrange the knowledge such that how any of us have come to understand RWAS in full so far over the last several years in a random manner could be systematized so an effective altruist fresh to the cause would come to know it as fast as they could read it. I estimate there are ~200 pieces, including blog posts, popular articles, and academic publications, on the topic of RWAS. I haven&apos;t had time to look at or organize them all yet.

Keeping the common core of knowledge as high-fidelity as conceivable before taking next steps seems imperative for a focus area like existential risk reduction.</span><span> I also want to capitalize on the eagerness for important consciousness-raising for RWAS and welfare biology as causes, which could be spun into potentially more networking value focused on meetups and events on RWAS at </span><a href=\"https://sf.eaglobal.org/\"><span>EA Global</span></a><span> this June.</span></p>\n<p><span>Disseminating a common core of knowledge (read: &quot;getting everyone on the same page regarding the state of RWAS&quot;) is a valuable initial step. However, since RWAS was almost done the first stage of network coordination as I mapped it out and reached out to the RWAS network, we can skip it and create more value by jumping to stages 2 and 3.</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li><span><span>[...] </span></span></li>\n<li><span><span><em>Community-Building. </em>Publish this knowledge base to gain public input and inform and educate others about the problem(s) you&#x2019;re trying to solve.

It&#x2019;s my experience various causes and communities adjacent to effective altruism have benefited from doing the same. Using social media like Facebook has served this function well for more purely social movements. A highly intellectual movement like EA or x-risk reduction seems to have strongly benefited from having control over an online platform with features social media lacks, and which promotes higher-quality discourse and epistemics.

Likewise for EA movement, the Centre for Effective Altruism (CEA) has set up offices at the heart of the EA movement in the San Francisco Bay Area for movement growth purposes, while maintaining an office for research at the University of Oxford as well.

Research organizations have benefited from a common pool of resources that is effective altruism as a social movement, receiving millions of dollars from thousands of individuals; having a constant source of potential candidates for an organization; and a vocal and eager supporter base. Unlike other fields of research, e.g., in the social sciences, EA organizations primarily rely on charitable donation from an association of private individuals, as opposed to similar research typically being sponsored by a large corporation, a university or government department. Large foundations like the </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GiveWell#Open_Philanthropy_Project\">Open Philanthropy Project</a><span> have a major influence over the EA community as a whole, but otherwise EA organizations have access to more grassroots support for non-profit efforts trying to approximate something like academic research in the private sphere. This means EA organizations which do work similar to think tanks mobilize resources more like a charitable or </span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_mobilization#Theory\">social movement</a><span> organization.</span></span></span></span></li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span><span>So while I think reading groups work well, from within the RWAS network and effective altruism there is potential to organize volunteer working groups which would be integrated with both WASR&apos;s and AE&apos;s new volunteer research assistance program. Ideally we&apos;d create through a combo of professional organizations and a grassroots network a </span><a href=\"/ea/1k6/the_almighty_hive_will/\"><span>hivemind</span></a><span> which could coordinate and achieve goals like seeding welfare biology as an academic field in earnest with greater efficiency than any of us expected. What kind of meetups among effective altruists around the world would best serve the current goals of RWAS will be the subject of upcoming discussion. Suffice to say I&apos;d like to see them coordinated around the world before EA Global, since by then wild animal suffering reducers attending EA Global will have a greater awareness of what resources are available in their </span><a href=\"https://eahub.org/groups\"><span>local EA groups/communities</span></a><span> for the purposes of the </span><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2016/02/the-value-of-coordination/\"><span>global coordination</span></a><span> of the RWAS network.<br></span></span></p>\n<h3><span>Towards a Unified Volunteer Organization System</span></h3>\n<p><span>I was thinking of how to square the needs of the RWAS network at different levels of specialization with the necessity of a common organizational system. I realized the </span><a href=\"https://www.readthesequences.com/\"><span>LessWrong Sequences</span></a><span> functioned for AI safety/alignment as a complete model of the domain, but for expedience of getting involved in the focus area it has only ever been absolutely necessary to read a subset of them. The corollary for RWAS literature archive is to parcel it into distinct modules which in total provide the full breadth of domain knowledge, but which can be consumed individually such that someone will be sufficiently knowledgeable to complete given task(s) as effectively as possible.</span></p>\n<p><span>Part of this tactical shift was inspired by a conversation I had with Carl Shulman. Namely that while reading groups and likewise meetups among rationalists and effective altruists were sufficient to achieve necessary awareness-raising and coalition-building to develop AI safety/alignment as a field, a lot of effort was unnecessarily wasted. While it was fine without hindsight to not be as efficient then, learning from the collective memory of effective altruism and other movements impels me to adapt the </span><a href=\"/ea/1kp/lessons_for_building_up_a_cause/\"><span>model I&#x2019;ve generated</span></a><span> to be more efficient. I&apos;m combining this recognition with the fact while as causes welfare biology and RWAS would benefit from more basic developments, RWAS organizations at present would most benefit from more volunteers. Thus the reading modules will be set up such that anyone who wanted to would become prepared to be as effective a RWAS volunteer as they could be in as short as time as possible, and transition sequential reading meetups focused on RWAS into volunteer working groups. </span></p>\n<p><span>There will be a few basic modules which will cover the fundamentals of RWAS from different perspectives (e.g., philosophy, biology, effective altruism, etc.). Past that, I&apos;ll prioritize organizing modules so that those who read them will be, more or less, ideal volunteers for a given project. For example, </span><a href=\"https://was-research.org/research-plan/\"><span>each of Wild Animal Suffering Research&#x2019;s researchers are pursuing individual research agendas</span></a><span> which, across the three of them, cover the main types of problems in seeding welfare biology as a field which can be addressed by existing empirical research. So after learning the basics of RWAS, another module would familiarize someone with </span><a href=\"https://was-research.org/\"><span>Wild Animal Suffering Research</span></a><span>&#x2019;s (WASR) approach, and one of three final modules would catch the reader up to speed with each of the research veins WASR researchers are respectively pursuing. For </span><a href=\"http://animal-ethics.org/\"><span>Animal Ethics</span></a><span>, a module to develop specialized volunteers for the organization might be themed on learning to see welfare biology as an academic biologist or ecologist would first see it, as that is what AE as an organization does for their project of bridge-building to academia.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Thus as a grassroots network RWAS would be integrated such that it will be subject to a coordination optimization process as it grows.. A cross-organizational volunteer management program could scale to an indefinite size, creating the opportunity for explosive increase in the rate of effectiveness of RWAS organizations for little to no financial overhead. </span></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Evan_Gaensbauer"}}, {"_id": "ERptCBkG5Xdmuywd9", "title": "How beneficial have vaccines been?", "postedAt": "2018-05-05T00:08:14.727Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><em>This essay was jointly written by Peter Hurford and Marcus A. Davis.</em><br><br>Previously we estimated <a href=\"/ea/1l4/how_much_does_it_cost_to_research_and_develop_a/\">how expensive it is to research and develop a vaccine</a> and also <a href=\"/ea/1l5/how_much_does_it_cost_to_rollout_a_vaccine/\">how expensive it is to roll-out a vaccine</a>. If vaccines are to be cost-effective, we need to realise significant benefits in return for this expenditure. So let&#x2019;s take a closer look at the specific and tangible benefits that vaccines have shown to provide, both for our health and the economy.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Simply put, the benefits to society brought about by vaccines can be categorised into two main types, health benefits and economic benefits, illustrated by the following equation: &#xA0;</p>\n<center>Total vaccine benefits = Health benefits + Economic benefits</center>\n<p><br><strong>What are the health benefits?</strong></p>\n<p>We take health benefits to be any benefit from vaccination which results in improved health, whether it be an illness prevented or a death averted. Looking at vaccination in general, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/Mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6316a4.htm\">Whitney, et al. (2014)</a> estimates that for children born in the &#xA0;U.S. from 1994-2013 731,000 deaths would be prevented over the course of their lifetimes from all vaccines, and over 500,000 of those prevented deaths would have been due to diptheria. For developing countries, <a href=\"http://cdrwww.who.int/bulletin/volumes/95/9/16-178475.pdf\">Ozawa, et al. (2017)</a> estimates that for children vaccinated between 2001 and 2020 in 73 GAVI-supported countries, 34 million deaths will be prevented over the course of their lifetimes, and 1,600 million DALYs will be saved, as a direct result of vaccinations (this excludes the impact of the routinely given diphtheria, pertussis, BCG, and first-dose measles vaccines).</p>\n<p><em>Assessing counterfactual impact</em></p>\n<p>To analyze the impact of additional funding for a given vaccine or the introduction of a new vaccine into an existing vaccine regime, you would typically examine the marginal impact those dollars will make due to additional vaccinations above the status quo (see for example, <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/192/Supplement_1/S133/2191572\">Podewils, et al., 2005</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24662710\">Blakely, et al., 2014</a>). This takes the existing levels of treatment of a disease as a given.<br><br>However, if you are thinking about comparing the entire counterfactual of what would have happened if there were no vaccine, it may make more sense for the initial baseline to be the treatment levels and rates of the disease at the outset when vaccines were introduced. On the other hand, if it happened that a particular vaccination was never developed for a specific disease, over time additional non-vaccine treatments and preventative measures may have been developed to tackle the disease, which haven&#x2019;t come to exist or, more modestly, the development of some vaccine-alternative treatments may have come about sooner.<br><br>Further, the counterfactual of medical research funds not spent on vaccination may be a shift in budget from vaccines to other health measures. Estimating how effective these hypothetical health measures or spending could theoretically have been might be very challenging<a href=\"#en1\">[1]</a>.</p>\n<p>Additionally, it is known that individuals with compromised immune systems are more likely to contract infections, like tuberculosis or pneumococcus, which are vaccine-preventable (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/36/5/652/455509\">Holmes, et al., 2003</a>). However, even if these types of disease were to be completely eliminated by vaccines, individuals with impaired immune systems would nonetheless remain susceptible to other types of illnesses that cannot be treated with a vaccination, and so may suffer from those illnesses instead.</p>\n<p><em>Considering the future</em></p>\n<p>Future technologies could possibly decrease the need for vaccination<a href=\"#en2\">[2]</a>. In the future, if a treatment is developed, preventative or otherwise, that ameliorates or eliminates the harmful effects of a disease, then the impact of the corresponding vaccine would be significantly diminished if not made completely redundant. To account for this, we need to consider the probability that such technologies will be developed , the cost of developing and distributing such treatments, and the timeline in which we expect them to be created.</p>\n<p>To estimate this may prove challenging as you need to disentangle the impact of the technologies that have helped to limit the scope of a particular disease, which may only have come into existence as a result of research into vaccines that provided greater conceptual understanding of the disease.</p>\n<p><br><strong>What are the economic benefits?</strong></p>\n<p><em>What counts as an economic benefit from vaccination?</em></p>\n<p>There are a range of non-health economic outcomes that could directly or indirectly be improved by the administration of vaccinations, from changes in the amount of money an individual can save by not having to pay for healthcare, to national macroeconomic improvement due to having a larger and healthier workforce. <a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/111/34/12313.full\">B&#xE4;rnighausen, et al. (2014)</a> argues for the scientific community to evaluate the economic impact of vaccinations on the broader end of this spectrum, rather than the current approach that has a &#xA0;typically &#x201C;narrow&#x201D; focus on health care cost savings and the time-saving of patient&#x2019;s and caretaker&#x2019;s time<a href=\"#en3\">[3]</a>.</p>\n<p>In addition to these &#x201C;narrow&#x201D; concerns, broader economic analysis could take into account productivity improvements due to vaccination, behavior changes (like increased education investment), community health benefits (including herd immunity), community economic benefits (local economic and political performance), welfare improvements due to decreased risk, and the direct &#x201C;utilitarian&#x201D; value of health gains (the value of the health gains themselves) (Ibid., Table 1).</p>\n<p><em>Evidence for Broad Benefits</em></p>\n<p>Multiple recent reviews have found many of these broader economic benefits, excluding direct health benefits and herd immunity, as relatively under-examined in the literature (<a href=\"https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-12-878\">Deogaonkar, et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X12015769\">Ozawa, et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1879437816300249\">Njau and Cairns, 2016</a>). Njau and Cairns (2016) found that of the 177 studies they reviewed on economic benefits of vaccines published between 2000 and 2016, only 31 (18%) examined broad economic benefits of vaccines, with only 14 (8%) investigating &#x201C;outcome-related productivity gains, long-term increased government revenues, behavioral-related benefits of vaccines and costs of [vaccine preventable disease] outbreak investigation, and the direct and indirect benefits of vaccines to the health-system.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Some of these broad economic benefits may not be considered as actual benefits by all interested parties. For instance, behavior change could theoretically include fertility reduction considered as an economic benefit (<a href=\"http://davidroodman.com/blog/2014/04/16/the-mortality-fertility-link/\">Roodman, 2014</a>)<a href=\"#en4\">[4]</a>. How you view the value of such behavior change depends, at least in part, on your values<a href=\"#en5\">[5]</a>.</p>\n<p>A meta-analysis of studies that found positive connections between vaccinations and various broad economic outcomes depicts that some of the studies had limited experimental evidence and/or observational evidence that vaccines are associated with improved cognition and education (<a href=\"https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-015-0446-9\">Jit, et al. 2015)</a>. For example, an observational study in the Philippines that found vaccination to improve cognitive performance in verbal reasoning, math, and reading, had a limited sample size (<a href=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00036846.2011.566203\">Bloom, Canning, &amp; Shenoy 2012)</a>. Jit, et. al., (2015) also found modeling evidence supported short-term macroeconomic improvement and, outside the field of vaccination, several studies showed a positive relationship between improved population health and long-term macroeconomic benefits.</p>\n<p><em>Estimates for Broad Savings</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://cdrwww.who.int/bulletin/volumes/95/9/16-178475.pdf\">Ozawa, et al. (2017)</a> estimates predict that between 2001 and 2020, the broad economic benefits of vaccination in 73 GAVI-supported countries will be worth between $1.1 trillion and $2.3 trillion, primarily a result of averting long-term losses to productivity by preventing deaths again, this data excludes the impact of the routinely given diphtheria, pertussis, BCG, and first-dose measles vaccines<a href=\"#en6\">[6]</a>. Over half of this benefit was estimated to be due to Hib, Hep-B, and PCV vaccinations<a href=\"#en7\">[7]</a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26858370\">Ozawa, et al. (2016a)</a> estimates have that over the decade of 2011-2020, vaccinations in low and middle-income countries will have a net economic benefit of 16 times what it costs to supply and deliver them and when accounting for the impact of vaccinations outside 2011-2020, this net benefit rises to 44 times what will be spent. Another study made similar findings, although conceptualised them slightly differently, estimating that the net economic benefits from GAVI&#x2019;s program in 75 countries between 2005 and 2020 is the equivalent of a 12.4% return on investment in 2005 rising to 18% by 2020, and that&#x2019;s excluding any medical costs averted (<a href=\"https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/9ff6/239aede9ebbc876c05a385b4f024eaa58df4.pdf\">Bloom, Canning, and Weston, 2005)</a>.</p>\n<p>In the developed world, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27733424\">Ozawa, et al. (2016b)</a> estimates that the yearly economic burden in the U.S. in 2015 alone due to vaccine-preventable diseases was $9 billion, with 80% of that burden due to unvaccinated individuals. <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/Mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm6316a4.htm\">Whitney, et al. (2014)</a> estimates that for U.S. children born from 1994-2013 vaccinations will result in a net saving of $295B from direct medical costs, and $1,380 billion from total costs of reducing rates of vaccine-preventable diseases.</p>\n<p>Even given concerns about dearth of direct studies of vaccination on specific economic outcomes, these estimates support the argument that vaccines are potentially being significantly undervalued (<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X16311811\">Bloom, et al., 2017</a>).</p>\n<p><br><strong>Considering Eradication</strong></p>\n<p>For diseases that have been eradicated completely, as happened with smallpox, and could potentially happen with polio and other infections in the future, there would be savings from vaccine production and rollout costs in addition to the &#x201C;narrow&#x201D; and &#x201C;broad&#x201D; economic benefits discussed above. There also would be additional savings from not having to monitor (as much) for the disease<a href=\"#en8\">[8]</a>. Additionally, costs for any public health campaigns and non-vaccine preventative treatment for the specific disease should also theoretically approach zero. When considering at the outset the total benefits of creating a vaccine, in order to account for the savings that would be made if the vaccine was to fully eradicate the disease, the chance that eradication could actually be achieved must also be estimated</p>\n<p>Conversely, even if a vaccine-preventable disease is completely eliminated, as smallpox has been, there still may be some ongoing costs of containment of vaccine stocks, and some continued monitoring for the disease. &#xA0;Caution should be used when attempting to estimate what happens to costs when a disease is eradicated, as there is currently only a single case of global eradication of a human disease due to vaccination.&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Smallpox</em></p>\n<p>Shortly after eradication there may still be extensive monitoring for a disease (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2491031/pdf/bullwho00075-0002.pdf\">Je&#x17E;ek, Khodakevich, &amp; Wickett, 1987</a>), and some countries may continue to vaccinate against an eradicated disease for at least a couple years post-eradication (Ibid.; <a href=\"http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/70373/1/WHO_Polio_10.01_eng.pdf\">WHO, 2010</a>). <a href=\"http://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/39485\">Fenner, et al. (1988)</a> found that globally from 1967 until 1979, the year after the last case of smallpox, there was an additional $23M a year spent to eliminate smallpox totalling $299M but that in 1967 the yearly costs, economic and otherwise, due to smallpox was many times that amount per year at about $1,500M (Chapter 31, pg 1363-1368)<a href=\"#en9\">[9]</a>.</p>\n<p><em>Polio</em></p>\n<p>There has been a sustained global effort to eradicate polio since 1988, since which time there has been a 99% reduction in incidence (<a href=\"http://polioeradication.org/polio-today/history-of-polio/\">GPEI, 2018</a>). Nevertheless, 30 years later, polio is still endemic in 3 countries&#x2014;Afghanistan, Nigeria, and Pakistan&#x2014;and there were outbreaks in two other countries in 2017, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Syria (Ibid., <a href=\"http://polioeradication.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/polio-vaccination-democratic-republic-of-the-congo-situation-report-180129-en.pdf\">WHO, 2017a</a>; <a href=\"http://www.emro.who.int/images/stories/syria/WHO_UNICEF_Situation_Report_28_cVDPV2_outbreak_Syria_3_1_2018.pdf\">WHO, 2017b</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014067361732442X\">Zaffran, et al., 2018</a>). <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21029809\">Tebbens, et al. (2010)</a> estimated that between 1988 and 2035, the polio eradication program will result in savings somewhere between $45.5 and $56.8 billion (in 2017 dollars, original estimate given in 2008 dollars as $40-50 billion) when compared to the cost of continued routine immunization. It should be noted that this study assumed eradication would be achieved by 2012 and routine immunization would end in 2016, however,it also noted was that the net benefit over this period only decreased 5-6% if the eradication was delayed 3 years. <br><br>Prior studies have assumed polio vaccination would have stopped even earlier (for example, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2486843/\">Bart, Foulds, &amp; Patriarca, 1996</a> and <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12531344\">Khan &amp; Ehreth, 2003</a>) and thus even though modeling of the potential economic benefits of eradication continues (<a href=\"https://www.kidrisk.org/images/Thompson.Interfaces.2015.pdf\">Thompson, et al., 2015</a>), there will be considerable uncertainty about the ultimate benefits of eradication efforts unless and until polio is actually eradicated.</p>\n<p><em>Others</em></p>\n<p>There is ongoing discussion of whether it is feasible and cost-effective to eradicate other diseases (at least in part) via vaccination including malaria (<a href=\"http://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(13)70002-0/fulltext?goback=.gde_120372_member_252902456\">Liu, et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"https://malariajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12936-016-1635-5\">Shretta, Avance&#xF1;a, &amp; Hatefi 2016</a>), measles (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/204/suppl_1/S47/2192303\">Moss &amp; Strebel, 2011</a>; <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/jid/article/204/suppl_1/S98/2192923\">Levin, et al., 2011</a>; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26023116\">Roberts, 2015</a>), rubella (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11348695\">Plotkin, 2001</a>; <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X12005944\">Goodson, et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-13-406\">Babigumira, Morgan, &amp; Levin, 2013</a>), and HPV (<a href=\"https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2458-13-642\">Crosignani, et al., 2013</a>).

This general risk of a renewed outbreak in an unvaccinated (or largely unvaccinated) population means that some money and resources will continue to be spent on that disease, even after it has been completely eradicated. Indeed, the risk of a post-eradication smallpox outbreak is a topic that has been long studied by academics (<a href=\"http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/pdfplus/10.2105/AJPH.76.10.1229\">Capps, Vermund, &amp; Johnsen, 1986</a>; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10367824\">Working Group on Civilian Biodefense, 1999</a>; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2631899/pdf/11747722.pdf\">Meltzer, et al., 2001</a>; <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v425/n6959/abs/nature02007.html\">Ferguson, et al., 2003</a>) and at least some government resources have been spent preparing for such an outbreak (<a href=\"http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110908/full/477150a.html\">Nature, 2011</a>; <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/07/us/us-to-vaccinate-500000-workers-against-smallpox.html\">New York Times, 2002</a>; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3778993/\">Sell and Watson, 2013</a>), and likely more spent analyzing whether such a plan is a worthwhile investment<a href=\"#en10\">[10]</a>.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s worth noting that it is not clear if post-eradication spending is as tightly correlated with the real risk from disease as spending on traditional monitoring and direct efforts to combat the disease. Thus, the actual spending on post-eradication preparedness measures may be too high or too low relative to the actual ongoing risk of a new outbreak (<a href=\"https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=sTkfAQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA184&amp;dq=posner+Public+Policy+Towards+Catastrophe&amp;ots=z2ci339OrC&amp;sig=4zqVcDGip94cG1z0wDKJFUTtNBM#v=onepage&amp;q=posner%20Public%20Policy%20Towards%20Catastrophe&amp;f=false\">Posner, 2008</a>).</p>\n<p>On the other hand, if a vaccine for a disease is never created, the specific bioterrorism or accidental risk from that disease may not exist but there would still be ongoing monitoring for the outbreak of a disease (see, for example, pre-vaccine Ebola monitoring in <a href=\"https://idpjournal.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/2049-9957-3-29?site=idpjournal.biomedcentral.com\">Tambo, et al., 2014</a>). Thus, post-eradication spending on monitoring for a disease outbreak isn&#x2019;t completely counterfactual.<br><br></p>\n<p><strong>Assessing the Benefits of Individual Vaccines</strong></p>\n<p>To get a better breakdown of vaccine benefits, we return to the vaccines we have examined &#xA0;in previous articles to highlight as a case study, and we look at the DALY burden prevented by that vaccine over time compared to the number of vaccinations.</p>\n<p>An early problem here is that it is hard to know what time period to count as benefits for a vaccine, as each vaccine is in a different stage of rollout (from already having outright eradication of smallpox to not yet even starting to rollout malaria and ebola vaccines). To try to better compare apples to apples, we look at two different hypothetical scenarios for a vaccine: rolling it out to 60% of the relevant population in Sub-saharan Africa (SSA), where most vaccines are targeted<a href=\"#en11\">[11]</a> and which could be thought of as a realistically achievable yet full-scale rollout of a vaccine, versus hypothetically pushing rollout until the entire disease is eradicated, like smallpox. Eradication is defined as a single roll-out where enough people are vaccinated such that ongoing vaccination campaigns are no longer necessary and the disease no longer comes back for a period of multiple decades (except maybe in a few very isolated cases).</p>\n<p>Note that all DALY estimates exclude the potential impact of herd immunity<a href=\"#en12\">[12]</a> or other non-DALY economic benefits<a href=\"#en13\">[13]</a>, and that we don&#x2019;t calculate eradication benefits for rotavirus<a href=\"#en14\">[14]</a> as it is not possible to eradicate that disease.</p>\n<p>Also note, the estimates for smallpox and measles are counterfactual estimates we calculated, and hence aren&#x2019;t about the real burden from these diseases today, while for other vaccines our estimate of the total burden if eradicated is more closely attached to the present DALY burden given these vaccines have only recently been introduced or haven&#x2019;t yet been introduced.</p>\n<div><br>\n<div>\n<table><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Vaccine</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>DALYs per vaccinated person in 2016</span><span>a</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Yearly DALYs at 60% vaccination rate in 2016 SSA</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Yearly DALYs if eradication</span><span>b</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Smallpox</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>0.14037</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>7,437,600</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>44,653,000</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Measles</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>0.20793</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>34,105,842</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>99,341,000</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Rotavirus</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>0.17990</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>4,589,392</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Not possible</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>HPV</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>0.01250</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>327,522</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>5,173,000</span><span>c</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>HIV</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>0.26343</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>9,655,005</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>57,575,000</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Malaria</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>0.40619</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>10,362,216</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>56,201,000</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Ebola</span><span>d</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>0.07502</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>92,685</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>309,000</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p><span>A - Estimates for DALYs prevented per person vaccinated over a 20 year period.</span></p>\n<p><span>B - These figures, except for smallpox and measles, are derived from their 2016 global DALY burdens from </span><a href=\"http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool?params=gbd-api-2016-permalink/d8ac743867dc9c03ba8e196b585d7b0d\"><span>Global Burden of Disease, Results Tool (2016e)</span></a></p>\n<p><span>C - This figure is 70% of the 2016 global burden from cervical cancer of 7,390,002.82. </span></p>\n<p><span>D - All ebola estimates here are a 5 year average from 2012-2016 and assumes a vaccine that is 50% effective.</span></p>\n<p><br><em>Smallpox Vaccine</em></p>\n</div>\n<p>Fenner, et. al. (1988) estimates that before the intensification of the eradication campaign in 1967, between 1.5 and 2 million people died from smallpox, and between 10 and 15 million contracted the disease (Ibid., Chapter 31, pg 1363). They also cited pre-eradication campaign estimates of $0.83 ($0.10 in 1960) per person per vaccination in developing countries and &#xA0;approximately $48 ($6.50 in 1960) per person per vaccination in developed countries (Ibid., Chapter 31, pg 1364; Chapter 9, pg 369, 413). At these costs, smallpox was costing approximately $10.4 billion per year and it&#x2019;s elimination results in a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wGC8m8rYCZdIXakvHyYcf61YKeBXEWYOO7_Sjjt9hJs/edit?usp=sharing\">net benefit of ~$8.2 billion per year</a>.</p>\n<p>However, while the economic benefit is relatively clear, calculating the DALY benefit from smallpox is difficult, as smallpox was eradicated before DALYs as a concept was invented. Instead, we need to estimate and infer from other sources.</p>\n<p>Using these incidence and death estimates, in the early 1960s every year smallpox vaccination was preventing somewhere between 430,000 and 1,000,000 deaths and approximately 13-31M death DALYs in the developed world per year and between 150,000-600,000 deaths and &#xA0;~4.5-18M death DALYs in the developing world, given only 20% of the developing world was being vaccinated at the time.<br><br>Using the same estimates as Fenner, et. al. (1988) and assuming the same percentages of the global population had continued to acquire and die from smallpox then without eradication, ~714-1,071M people would have acquired smallpox between 1968 and 2016 and ~109-138M people would have died from it during that period<a href=\"#en15\">[15]</a>. If it assumed that the death rate and percentage of cases would have fallen to 20% of their 1967 rates, those estimates would be ~143-214M cases and ~22-28M deaths over the same period<a href=\"#en16\">[16]</a>.</p>\n<p>At 30 DALYs per death<a href=\"#en17\">[17]</a>, that means eradication prevented ~3,288-4,140M DALYs at 100% of the death rate of 1967, and ~658-828M DALYs at 20% of the death rate of 1967<a href=\"#en18\">[18]</a>. If smallpox still was endemic and modern SSA had a 60% vaccination rate with a case percentage and death rate similar to those of the developed world in 1967, this would imply ~7.4M DALYs would be prevented via vaccination in 2016. Finally, if between 1968 and 2016 the case rate had held steady at what it was in endemic countries in 1967 but the global death rate fell to half of of the death rate of the 1967 rate of ~10%, this would imply eradication benefit estimates of 0.006 DALYs saved per vaccination during the initial rollout and ~44.7M DALYs saved in the year 2016.</p>\n<p><em>Measles Vaccine</em></p>\n<p>To understand the impact of the measles vaccine, it is not sufficient to look at the current DALY burden of measles, as this rate is already the result of over half a century of vaccination lowering the DALY burden. To truly understand the impact of the measles vaccine, we would have to rewind the clock back to the very first rollout and understand the costs and benefits as they happened then, not now.</p>\n<p>Prior to widespread vaccination, in the early 1960s, globally there were around 135M cases and 7-8M deaths from measles each year (<a href=\"http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/43048/1/9241592303.pdf\">Clements &amp; Hussey, 2004, Chapter 4</a>). Given a population of ~3 billion at the time (<a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL\">World Bank, 2017</a>), that means ~4.5% of the world population got measles each year, ~0.2% of the total population died each year from it, and the case fatality rate was ~5-6%. Nearly the entirety of the DALY burden of measles comes from death (<a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/mortality_burden_disease/daly_rates/text/en/\">WHO, 2018</a>), so we will only look at that. Since the measles vaccine is 85% effective at one dose and essentially universally effective with two doses (<a href=\"https://books.google.ca/books?id=nVppAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA250#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">CDC, 2014</a>, p250), this would roughly imply that widespread vaccination would have averted a measles death for every <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iRwCa4iepK7VOO80rIDp7ILWrBcg8inQ_aJQsJ4NWg4/edit?usp=sharing\">510 single-dose vaccinations or every 438 two-dose vaccinations</a>. At 30 DALYs per death[17], this would be 15-17 vaccinations per DALY or ~0.059-0.069 DALYs per vaccinated person during the initial rollout.</p>\n<p>In the modern world, the death rate from measles is quite different. In developing countries, the rate ranges from ~0.7-1.3% for the unvaccinated population in India (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4019661/\">Murhekar, et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26220243\">Raoot, et al., 2016</a>), to 5-10% in endemic regions of SSA, to as low as 0.1% in developed countries (<a href=\"http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040024\">Moss, 2007</a>; <a href=\"https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=kgw0sEj_ZlYC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA151&amp;ots=DpsmT_IoTI&amp;sig=HdNZ1HHhSK6m2p9Fl6OTF239t5Q#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">Naniche, 2009</a>). In the U.S., for example, the death rate is 0.2% (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/pubs/pinkbook/meas.html\">CDC, 2017</a>), and measles has little impact on DALY otherwise (<a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/mortality_burden_disease/daly_rates/text/en/\">WHO, 2016</a>). These figures imply a death prevented from measles per 264-545 single-dose vaccinations or 227-468 per two dose vaccinations in modern SSA with 16-18 vaccinations per DALY, and figures of 2,034-3,894 single-dose and 1,746-3,343 two-dose vaccinations per death prevented with 111-130 vaccinations per DALY for modern India. Using the case rate of the pre-vaccine world and the current death rate in SSA from measles as baselines, if modern SSA had a 60% vaccination rate this would imply ~34.1M DALYs prevented in 2016. Again assuming the case rate of the pre-vaccine world and a death rate of 1% would imply 2016 global estimates of ~0.011 DALYs saved per vaccination and ~99.3M DALYs saved if measles were eradicated.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2011.0382\">Stack et al., (2011)</a> estimates (an inflation adjusted) ~$1.1B per year estimate in economic benefits from expanded measles vaccination in GAVI-supported countries from 2011-2020. &#xA0;However, <a href=\"http://cdrwww.who.int/bulletin/volumes/95/9/16-178475.pdf\">Ozawa et al. (2017)</a> estimates actual and projected economic benefits from second dose and supplementary vaccinations from measles, excluding the first dose of measles vaccination at a far higher (inflation-adjusted) rate of ~$32B a year from 2001-2020 in 75 GAVI-supported countries.</p>\n<p><em>Rotavirus Vaccine</em></p>\n<p>The rotavirus vaccine is 39-85% effective (<a href=\"http://rotacouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/White-paper-FINAL-v2.pdf\">RotaCouncil, 2016</a>, p11) and has reduced diarrhea by 30-54% in SSA (<a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa0904797#t=article\">Madhi et al., 2010</a>, <a href=\"https://journals.lww.com/pidj/Fulltext/2013/12000/Impact_of_Rotavirus_Vaccine_on_Childhood_Diarrheal.22.aspx\">Msimang, et al., 2013</a>)<a href=\"#en19\">[19]</a>.

For children under five, the DALY burden was 41.7M DALYs in 2005 and 25.5M DALYs in 2016 (Ibid.).</p>\n<p>If we assume we can achieve a 60% vaccination rate of the under-five population in SSA, by vaccinating 96.3M children under five (see <a href=\"https://www.populationpyramid.net/sub-saharan-africa/2016/\">Population Pyramid</a>), and reducing diarrhea by 30-54% among those vaccinated, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aihFKqfySelIQJrfg8ZoayFXVMonHhCKJ6Szv3Zn-Mk/edit?usp=sharing\">we would avert</a> ~7.5-13M DALYs per year using the 2005 DALY rate or 4.6-8.3M DALYs using the 2016 rate, with a DALYs per vaccination of ~0.180-0.307.</p>\n<p>Unlike for measles, <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2011.0382\">Stack, et al., (2011)</a>, which analyzed 2011-2020, and <a href=\"http://cdrwww.who.int/bulletin/volumes/95/9/16-178475.pdf\">Ozawa, et al. ( 2017)</a>, which covered 2001-2020, have similar yearly estimated benefits from rotavirus vaccination at ~$4B and ~$3B a year in GAVI-supported countries respectively.</p>\n<p><em>HPV Vaccine</em></p>\n<p>Rolling out the HPV vaccine to all girls aged 5-15 in SSA with a 60% vaccination rate would involve 130M vaccinations (see <a href=\"https://www.populationpyramid.net/sub-saharan-africa/2016/\">Population Pyramid</a>). Cervical cancer currently accounts for 7.4M DALYs for all ages, and 3.1M DALYs in women aged 15-49 (<a href=\"http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool?params=gbd-api-2016-permalink/4c30888af92017cdcc9209187ecd590d\">Global Burden of Disease, Results Tool, 2016b</a>), with ~1.8M DALYs in all ages and ~780,000 DALYs in ages 15-49 in SSA. HPV vaccines provide 76-98% protection against 70% of cervical cancers (<a href=\"http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp078053\">Agosti &amp; Goldie, 2007</a>; <a href=\"https://bmcinfectdis.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2334-11-13\">Lu et al., 2011</a>)<a href=\"#en21\">[21]</a>. Given these estimates, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aihFKqfySelIQJrfg8ZoayFXVMonHhCKJ6Szv3Zn-Mk/edit?usp=sharing\">the HPV vaccine could prevent</a> ~249,000 to 321,000 DALYs per year in SSA, at a rate of ~0.002 DALYs prevented per vaccination. Were HPV eradicated completely, this would save ~5.2M DALYs per year assuming a 70% reduction in cervical cancer.</p>\n<p><em>HIV Vaccine</em></p>\n<p>If an HIV vaccine comes to exist and is 50% effective (or more), and is given to 60% of the eligible population, it would avert 30% of all HIV<a href=\"#en22\">[22]</a>. Given that HIV in SSA among those 15-49 years old accounts for 29.5M-35M DALYs (<a href=\"http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool?params=gbd-api-2016-permalink/ca19f6c2d6a9f0c83c8bc3d7833269a4\">Global Burden of Disease, &#xA0;Results Tool, 2016c</a>), this would imply <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aihFKqfySelIQJrfg8ZoayFXVMonHhCKJ6Szv3Zn-Mk/edit?usp=sharing\">the HIV vaccine rollout could save</a> 9.7M using the mean DALY estimate at a rate of ~0.35 DALYs per vaccine. Were HIV to be completely eradicated this would prevent ~57.6M DALYs per year.</p>\n<p><em>Malaria Vaccine</em></p>\n<p>While insecticide-treated nets, anti-malarial medicines, and indoor residual spraying have likely reduced global malaria mortality by 50% over the past fifteen years, they are still unable to drive down malaria in some areas despite good coverage (<a href=\"http://www.gavi.org/about/governance/gavi-board/minutes/2016/22-june/minutes/09---malaria-vaccine-pilots---appendices/\">GAVI, 2016</a>, &#xA0;p1). Emerging issues about insecticide resistance also challenge these efforts (Ibid.). According to WHO, Malaria still causes over 438,000 deaths per year (Ibid.). Based on this, WHO, GAVI, and other organizations have pushed for the development of a vaccine for malaria.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, the Global Burden of Disease estimates show that malaria is responsible for 56.2M DALYs, with 44.3M DALYs for those under five (<a href=\"http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool?params=gbd-api-2016-permalink/a5fdf7803b03487a8b851317d76fc5d2\">Global Burden of Disease, &#xA0;Results Tool, 2016d</a>). Given that the malaria vaccine is currently 39% effective (GAVI, 2016, p1) and assuming a 60% vaccination rate, that would mean vaccinating 96.3M children (see <a href=\"https://www.populationpyramid.net/sub-saharan-africa/2016/\">Population Pyramid</a>) <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aihFKqfySelIQJrfg8ZoayFXVMonHhCKJ6Szv3Zn-Mk/edit?usp=sharing\">would save</a> ~10.3M DALYs at a rate of ~0.406 DALYs per vaccination. Were malaria to be completely eradicated this would prevent ~56.2M DALYs per year at the current DALY burden.</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br><br>By our calculations, ignoring ebola, the benefits of the vaccines we have analyzed ranges from ~250,000 to 34M DALYs per year in modern SSA or ~9-634 vaccinations per DALY prevented for a vaccine, with averages of 11.6M and 132, respectively.</p>\n<p>As mentioned above, there is more limited data from which to estimate the broad economic benefits of vaccination. However, <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wGC8m8rYCZdIXakvHyYcf61YKeBXEWYOO7_Sjjt9hJs/\">by our estimates</a>, using Fenner et al. (1988), smallpox vaccination had a net benefit of ~$8.2B per year in the early 1960s. This aligns fairly well with the modern academic literature on the broad economic impact of vaccines. For instance, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1kQErLeOrYdAw6OdDqlKMpz21o8LNAYipyT5UrRug-rY\">for the bundle of vaccines we examined</a>, <a href=\"http://cdrwww.who.int/bulletin/volumes/95/9/16-178475.pdf\">Ozawa, et al., 2017</a> estimates that between 2001 and 2020, the average yearly benefit in developing countries would be ~$8B while <a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.2011.0382\">Stack et al., 2011</a> estimates the benefit at ~$3B per year. For the average vaccine in each study (which includes some we don&#x2019;t examine here), Ozawa, et. al. (2017) had a much higher estimated benefit of ~$17.4B while Stack et al. (2011) estimated a ~$2.3B per year per vaccine.</p>\n<p>Making a full accounting of the economic benefit of vaccinations may mean further updating our perception of the total benefits of vaccination.<br><br>Our cost-effectiveness analysis of the development of vaccines is in three parts on the EA Forum: <a href=\"/ea/1o6/what_is_the_costeffectiveness_of_researching/\">Part 1</a>, <a href=\"/ea/1o7/costeffectiveness_of_vaccines_exploring_model/\">Part 2</a>, and <a href=\"/ea/1o8/costeffectiveness_of_vaccines_appendices_and/\">Part 3</a>.

Chapter 10, for example, makes it clear that 1967 US dollars are being used, but there&#x2019;s isn&#x2019;t as clear a statement in Chapter 31, where these figures originate. <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=1wGC8m8rYCZdIXakvHyYcf61YKeBXEWYOO7_Sjjt9hJs\">Assuming a baseline of 1967</a>, total spending on eradication was approximately $2.2B in 2017 dollars while the yearly averted costs were approximately $10.4B. Naturally, the ratio of spending to benefits holds with or without an inflation adjustment.</span></p>\n<p><span>[10]: For example, in 1997 the U.S. government spent ~$33.5M ($22M inflation unadjusted) for 300,000 doses of smallpox vaccines (<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2001/10/22/us/nation-challenged-strategy-sept-11-attacks-led-push-for-more-smallpox-vaccine.html\">New York Times, 2001</a>). <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3778993/\">Sell and Watson (2013)</a> estimate the US federal government spent approximately $262M on smallpox prevention between 2000 and 2005 but, along with <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28654317\">Watson, Watson, and Sell (2017)</a>, only $3.5M total since then. Some of this is spent vaccinating against the specific threat of the use of smallpox as a biological weapon in high risk areas (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/epirev/article/28/1/3/567796\">Grabenstein, et al., 2006</a>). Interestingly, in the face of a potential threat from North Korea, South Korea has chosen not to immunize their troops against smallpox but U.S. troops deployed to South Korea are vaccinated (<a href=\"http://www.nti.org/gsn/article/south-korea-not-prepared-smallpox-attack-north-white-paper/\">Nuclear Threat Initiative, 2012</a>).</span></p>\n<p><span>[11]: Note however, that some vaccines may be better targeted in regions other than SSA, like India. For example, malaria is more prevalent in SSA than India (<a href=\"http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool?params=gbd-api-2016-permalink/af37d9df3d8a64c60f391df461407851\">Global Burden of Disease, &#xA0;Results Tool, 2016f</a>) and the largest burden on rotavirus is in India (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/62/suppl_2/S96/2478843\">Tate, et al., 2016</a>), so this scenario may unfairly penalize analysis of the cost-effectiveness of rotavirus.</span></p>\n<p><span>[12]: In brief, herd immunity is the phenomenon of protection from infection for those not immune to an infection which is created by having some other portion of the population that is immune. What percentage of the population needs to be vaccinated before the benefits of herd immunity come to exist in a population depends, among other things, on the efficacy of the vaccine, the basic reproduction number of the infection, how random (or not) the interactions of the population are, and selection effects of what portion of the population is vaccinated. For a more thorough view of how herd immunity impacts the effectiveness vaccination campaigns see <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/52/7/911/299077\">Fine, Eames, and Heymann (2011)</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span>[13]: Economic benefits were impossible to calculate on a per-vaccine basis as we don&apos;t know the number of vaccines given in any of the economic analyses other than for smallpox. None of the economic benefit studies we cite give this information for the developing world.</span></p>\n<p><span>[14]: Rotavirus is spreadable to humans via nonhuman animals (<a href=\"http://jgv.microbiologyresearch.org/content/journal/jgv/10.1099/vir.0.2008/001206-0#tab2\">Steyer, et al., 2008</a>) and thus is unlikely to be eradicated via vaccination (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/cid/article/59/7/982/2895573\">Anderson, 2014</a>), particularly under our definition of a one-time effort. Whether HIV can ever be eradicated via vaccination is unclear, as it too is believed to have originated via interspecies transmission of simian immunodeficiency viruses, the primate relative of HIV (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4254776/\">Faria, et al., 2014</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3234451/\">Sharp and Hahn, 2011</a>). Thus, discussion of the eradication of HIV should be considered speculative and theoretical.</span></p>\n<p><span>[15]: The assumption that smallpox would have continued to kill the same percentage of the population as it did in 1967 is unrealistic for several reasons, most prominently among them that the proportion of the world&#x2019;s population living in smallpox endemic countries in 1967 (those driving the case and fatality rates) did not remain constant from 1968 to 2017. Additionally, medical advances would likely have meant some decline in the death rate from smallpox if there had been no eradication campaign. However, one possible alternative assumption for a &#x201C;flat&#x201D; trendline, that the total number of deaths would have remained constant, also seems misguided because the world population has more than doubled between 1968 and 2017. Simply put, we do not make this estimate with great certainty.</span></p>\n<p><span>[16]: <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12531324\">Ehreth (2003)</a> has a fairly different estimate than the figures we use here. In (Table 2) estimates the study estimates 5,000,000 years of life saved (YLS) per year from smallpox eradication. At 35 years per person that&#x2019;s 142,857 prevented deaths a year (by 1999). The study uses death estimates from times before widespread vaccination (1900-1904 for US, pre-1971 for Africa) but it appears the original deaths per year estimates used here aren&apos;t adjusted for increased population as it states the current per year US YLS estimate is &#x201C;based upon 48,164 average deaths between 1900&#x2013;1904 multiplied by 35-year life expectancy&#x201D; and the same method was applied to the African death estimate of 26,659.</span></p>\n<p><span>[17]: It&#x2019;s unclear what the correct DALYs per death figure should be. We follow <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2007/12/04/what-a-life-saved-means/\">Karnofsky (2007)</a> which estimated that a &#x201C;life saved&#x201D; in SSA for a child under five gives them a 50% chance of living another 60 years, or an expected value of 30 years (see <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/additional/life-expectancy-in-SSA\">more here</a>). However, reverse engineering a DALY/death figure from <a href=\"http://ghdx.healthdata.org/gbd-results-tool?params=gbd-api-2016-permalink/d272971954dccd2dc5db017a825e3485\">GBD (2016)</a> suggests 84 DALYs/death, which seems intuitively high.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>[18]: Smallpox came in two strains, Variola minor and Variola major. Variola major is significantly worse and carries a case-fatality rate of 20% or more in the unvaccinated, whereas the case-fatality rate of Variola minor is under 1% (Fenner, et. al., 1988, p5-6). Additionally, Variola major appears to have symptoms roughly as bad as malaria for those who contract it but don&#x2019;t die from it (Ibid., p6). We estimate that about 7% of the DALY burden of Variola major would come from the morbidity and 93% from the mortality, though this would vary depending on how you weight the badness of death[17]. All outbreaks of smallpox in Asia and most of those in Africa were due to Variola major, wheares Variola minor was endemic in some countries of Europe, North America, South America, and many parts of Africa. Given the preponderance and severity of Variola major in Africa, we chose to model Africa as only being affected by Variola major.</span></p>\n<p><span>[19]: It may not make sense to extrapolate the current efficacy of the rotavirus vaccine (or other very new vaccines like HPV and malaria) as anything other than the initial efficacy. Vaccines are improved and refined in part by being actually implemented and manipulating the timing of the shots, the number of shots, and by learning from impact in a real population. For example, the pneumococcal vaccine, PCV, has gone through several iterations with PCV 7 being replaced by PCV 10, which is being replaced by PCV 13, each of which covers more strains of pneumococcal than the last (see, for example, <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21983361\">Miller, et al., 2011</a>). Accounting for this would change our estimate of rollout DALYs prevented since it may be preferable, in such a modeling exercise, to use a longer time horizon and some probability distributions on the potential efficacy of the given vaccine over time.</span></p>\n<p><span>[20]: Of course, the rotavirus vaccine is not responsible for this entire decline.</span></p>\n<p><span>[21]: These are heavily simplifying assumptions. HPV vaccines accounting for 70% of cervical cancers does not imply that these cancers are responsible for 70% of the DALY burden.</span></p>\n<p><span>[22]: 60% vaccination rate at 50% effectiveness implies 30% (60% * 50%) for the overall burden. A vaccine of this efficacy and at this scale would possibly have a far greater proportional impact on new infections (<a href=\"https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.26.4.1147\">Stover et al., 2007</a>). This estimate assumes high-risk behavior stays roughly the same. This may not be a realistic assumption of real behaviour in response to an HIV vaccine (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19925897\">Newman, et al., 2010</a>). A low-efficacy HIV vaccine given to a mid to low percentage of the population, combined with an increase in risky behavior could actually increase the burden of HIV (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12876900\">Blower, Schwartz, and Mills, 2003</a>).</span></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Marcus_A_Davis"}}, {"_id": "hnb7yYfJ5bjLdYvGq", "title": "The Life You Can Save's 2017 Annual Report and 2018 Strategic Plan", "postedAt": "2018-05-03T19:53:48.663Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><h1>&#xA0;</h1>\n<p>The Life You Can Save&apos;s Annual Report describes our work and impact in 2017 and our plans for the future.

I have been very convinced by the EA argument for several years, but up until this point I have only made small donations, averaging maybe .5% of my income. This is despite me being older and wealthier than a lot of my EA peers, who have been making substantially higher donations in proportion to their income. It was a deliberate decision on my part to delay my serious giving, as I felt that the best way to maximize both my own utility and my contribution to the world was by giving more later in life, having first consolidated my own financial security. I would like to give a brief explanation of why I hold this view.</p>\n<p>I see financial life essentially as a race. We are born and temporarily given a place to live (generally our parents house). We are dependent on others to provide for our daily needs and our education until we enter the workforce. Once we start working, we pay our own way, including for the cost of accommodation. We can then choose to save to purchase our own property, to avoid having to rent. Generally, once we have made such a purchase, we are only a couple of years away from considering starting a family. The cycle renews at this point but we are in a different role, now we are doing much of the supporting for our children. During this period our costs are much higher than they would be we did not have kids. You need to buy more food, require bigger living space, holidays are more expensive... the list goes on and on. Once the kids reach an age where they become financially independent, our costs of living drop substantially, this usually occurs somewhere between 5 and 10 years before our own retirement, at which point our income will also fall.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>From my experience and listening to those around me, it feels like the race is quite uneven depending on whether you are &apos;ahead&apos; or &apos;behind&apos; the pack. There are any number of analogies you can use here, but the point is that if you get ahead early, it can feel like you are riding the crest of a wave or out for any easy jog - but if you fall behind, it can feel like you are swimming against the current or running while breathing only the dust kicked up by those in front. If this is true, then giving a substantial part of you income (say 10% or more) in the early part of your life is not a good idea. It is counterproductive for both your own life and your total giving.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>If we make any kind of reasonable assumptions about renting, house price increases and mortgage repayments, it makes a lot of sense for people to save to purchase their own home as soon as possible. Once you own your home you are protected from future increases in house prices and rents. I also think it&apos;s a good idea to have a reasonable amount of savings to cover emergencies or large expected costs (such as college education or retirement). Once you have achieved these levels of wealth accumulation, you will be in a much better position to donate money. If you accept this argument, then it is counterproductive to make substantial donations to charities until you reach this level of financial security.</p>\n<p>I have nothing but respect for the people whom I have spoken to within the EA community, who make serious lifestyle choices to allow themselves to donate large proportions of their incomes, but I&apos;m suggesting that not only is there an easier way (by securing one&apos;s own financial situation first) but that this way will be more constructive in the long run. To be clear, this approach works regardless of your spending level relative to your income level. So if you want to only spend half of what you earn, and you are currently saving half of the surplus and giving half away, you would still be better off saving all of it, until you are financially secure and then increasing the proportion you give away substantially.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>There are risks to this approach - Lifestyle Drift is one, and Value Drift is another. Further, if we believe that there is a high discount rate to EA donations over time, as the best interventions steadily get fully funded then this is another factor. Nonetheless, I think this approach is worth more EAs considering - in particular giving away .5% per year (to stay in habit) and having a fixed target (say of home ownership, 6 months living expenses in savings, and well funded retirement plan) after which you plan to substantially increase donation to say 60% of discretionary income.</p>\n<p>But there are also risks to the approach of giving substantially from an early age. I would also expect that doing so causes donor burnout, which may be one of the causes of Value Drift that was posted about recently. It&apos;s really hard to give away large sums of money (relative to income) when doing so requires sacrifice. This becomes increasingly true when you are faced with making financial decisions on the part of your children as well as yourself. Whereas, it&apos;s actively enjoyable to give away large sums when you have already covered all of your personal expenses and do not feel like donations are going to have a big impact on your spending choices.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>I tried to put together a numerical example for this post, but even with several simplifying assumptions, looking at the financial situation of a household over a 40 year time period becomes too complicated to easily explain in an article such as this. But if anyone wishes to discuss in more detail I would be happy to at least attempt to do so.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "jamie_cassidy"}}, {"_id": "MQWAsdm8MSzYNkD9X", "title": "Announcing the Effective Altruism Handbook, 2nd edition", "postedAt": "2018-05-02T07:58:24.124Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><span>Today CEA is releasing the second edition of our Effective Altruism Handbook. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>You can get the pdf version </span><a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/handbook/\"><span>here</span></a><span>, and we also have </span><a href=\"https://assets.ctfassets.net/ohf186sfn6di/7DDPxvH9csYAka4iG08AwM/849d05f1dd2671084c9e6f59f259e89c/Effective_Altruism_Handbook.epub\"><span>epub</span></a><span>/</span><a href=\"https://efctv.org/eahandbookmobi\"><span>mobi</span></a><span> versions for people who prefer e-readers.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>What is CEA&apos;s EA Handbook?</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>It&#x2019;s an introduction to some of the core concepts in effective altruism.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>If you&#x2019;re new to effective altruism, it should give you an overview of the key ideas and problems that we&#x2019;ve found so far.

In this post, I explore one possible solution: a crowdfunding platform for projects that are endorsed by trusted EAs. (Note that a crowdfunding platform was proposed&#xA0;by Linda Linsefors in response to a comment by David Moss on this <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/1722174211172262/\">Facebook post</a>.)</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>How It Could Work</h3>\n<p>Below, I attempt to work out the details of how a crowdfunding platform could work.

What appears below is a description of an idea, not an announcement of&#xA0;</em><em>something that CEA plans to implement.</em></p>\n<p>The Centre for Effective Altruism (CEA) invites people who have been involved in the EA community at a deep level for several years to serve as&#xA0;evaluators for one or more cause areas. (Nobody can apply to be an evaluator, which means there are no explicit rejections.)</p>\n<p>Evaluators who accept the invitation for a cause area must agree to rate all submissions within that cause area (to avoid selection bias) and to keep their ratings confidential (to encourage honesty).</p>\n<p>The goal&#xA0;is&#xA0;to have a large number of evaluators for each cause area.</p>\n<p>Anyone with one year of substantial involvement in EA can submit a project proposal to&#xA0;CEA.</p>\n<p>Proposals must include a description of the idea,&#xA0;an estimate of the probability of success, the benefits if the project is successful, any possible harms and the probability of each possible harm, and the amount of funding needed.</p>\n<p>CEA anonymizes the proposals and sends them to all evaluators for the relevant cause area.</p>\n<p>Each of those evaluators rates the idea from -10 to 10. (The lower end of the scale is -10 to allow evaluators to indicate that they think the project has a negative expected value.)</p>\n<p>Evaluators can&#xA0;include feedback encouraging/discouraging the proposer from pursuing the project further and/or providing suggestions for improvement.</p>\n<p>Evaluators can also endorse a proposal (if they think it&apos;s a good idea) or&#xA0;endorse a person (if they believe the person is highly competent).&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The proposal is&#xA0;considered approved if it meets the following criteria:</p>\n<p>a. the average rating is above x;</p>\n<p>b. there are n people who endorse the idea; and</p>\n<p>c. there are m people who endorse the person.</p>\n<p>(The process for determining whether a proposal is approved is&#xA0;automated&#xA0;and CEA never sees the rating of any specific evaluator or the identity of the evaluator(s) endorsing a person.)</p>\n<p>Once a proposal is approved, all evaluators in the relevant cause area estimate the probability the project will succeed if undertaken. Those who endorsed the idea provide a brief statement explaining why they did so. (There is no statement for endorsing a person.)</p>\n<p>CEA can veto an approved proposal. (This helps prevent unilateralist&apos;s curse and helps manage reputational risk.) However, this power is&#xA0;exercised sparingly since vetoing all proposals except those supported by CEA would&#xA0;result in this platform becoming EA Grants.*</p>\n<p>Proposers are informed of whether their proposal was accepted (meaning it was approved without being vetoed) or rejected (meaning it failed to secure approval or was vetoed) as well as any feedback from the evaluators. Proposers do not see the&#xA0;average rating or the number or identity of people who endorsed the proposer. Additionally, unsuccessful proposers do not see the number or identity of people who endorsed the idea or the reason that the proposal was rejected (i.e. which of the approval criteria it failed to satisfy and whether it was vetoed). CEA periodically releases aggregate statistics.</p>\n<p>A rejected proposal can&#xA0;be resubmitted if CEA determines that it&apos;s been materially improved.</p>\n<p>Those proposals that are accepted appear publicly on a platform alongside the name and statement of evaluators who endorsed the proposal, the average estimated probability of success (endorsers only), the average estimated probability of success (all evaluators), and CEA&apos;s estimate of how much money&#xA0;it would take to fully fund the project. The names of evaluators who endorsed the proposer do not appear publicly and are not disclosed to anyone.</p>\n<p>The proposer can either choose to only allow unconditional donations or to also allow conditional donations (money that will be returned unless the amount needed to fully fund the project as estimated by CEA is raised within a certain period of time).</p>\n<p>Proposers can return all&#xA0;donations&#xA0;if they receive too little to go forward with the project.</p>\n<p>Proposers who take the money must&#xA0;post an update every y months for a period of z years.</p>\n<p>*Alternatively,&#xA0;this system could be used to evaluate ideas for EA Grants (with projects that are approved but not funded or not fully funded&#xA0;listed on the platform).</p>\n<p><em>Note: I am not an employee of the Centre for Effective Altruism.

It could increase the number of worthwhile projects funded since:</p>\n<p>a. some&#xA0;projects that are currently&#xA0;disfavored&#xA0;by a single person who controls a key funding source would be rated well by a large group of evaluators, which could influence that person;</p>\n<p>b. people may have more confidence in projects that are currently recommended by&#xA0;others if they&#xA0;know that those recommendations represent the overall views of the community*;</p>\n<p>c. more people would have access to the donation recommendations of those who currently only recommend worthwhile projects to others privately; and</p>\n<p>d. there would be a single platform where busy donors could easily find most project ideas alongside relevant information.</p>\n<p>*Think of this as allowing people to get additional draws from the distribution of&#xA0;how members of the EA community&#xA0;view the project, which allows them&#xA0;to determine whether those recommending the project are at the median of the distribution of community views or whether they are at the right tail (and also whether and to what extent the left tail goes into the negative).</p>\n<p>2.&#xA0;Through the process of launching new projects, EAs would build valuable skills (which is possible even when projects ultimately fail).</p>\n<p>3. People may&#xA0;be less likely to unilaterally start a bad project if there is a formal mechanism for an idea to receive a firm rejection from the community. (The feedback could also result in improvement to good ideas but I think that&apos;s currently already possible.)</p>\n<p>4. Allowing people to donate on the condition that others donate could help avoid&#xA0;the collective action problem that arises when it is only worthwhile to fund a project if enough other money is going towards it (and where your money alone could fund a smaller scale version of the project, meaning that the proposer would not necessarily return it if you donated it unconditionally).</p>\n<p>5. It would allow the EA community to learn valuable information such as:</p>\n<p>a. the number and quality of project ideas in the community;</p>\n<p>b. the probability of a project succeeding (by type, by cause);</p>\n<p>c. the average accuracy of predictions (and which people are above average); and</p>\n<p>d. why projects fail and what can be done to avoid failure.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>Potential&#xA0;Costs</h3>\n<p>1. There&#xA0;are various costs associated with projects being funded that otherwise would not have been funded including:</p>\n<p>a. the&#xA0;opportunity cost of the funding, which could have gone elsewhere;*</p>\n<p>b. the opportunity cost of the talent of people&#xA0;working on the project, which could have been&#xA0;applied within an existing EA organization;</p>\n<p>c. the risk that the project causes harm; and</p>\n<p>d. the risk of reputational harm from the project failing or causing harm.</p>\n<p>If people tend to be overly optimistic about proposals (and thus overestimate expected benefits), then they will sometimes fund projects despite the above costs being greater than the expected benefits.</p>\n<p>*The opportunity cost might be especially high if the money&#xA0;would have gone to EA Funds, the fund manager would also have given it to&#xA0;risky projects with high expected value, and the fund managers are much better at judging which ones are likely to succeed.</p>\n<p>2. It could increase the reputational cost for harmful projects (including ones that would have occurred absent the platform) by making it harder to distance the EA community from such projects.</p>\n<p>3. Scammers may join the EA community and seek project funding in bad faith. Not only does this cause all of the problems identified above (diverted money, lost time, reputational harm etc.), it could decrease trust within the EA community.</p>\n<p>4. There is an opportunity cost to the time spent creating this system, the time spent managing it, the time spent writing proposals, and the time time spent evaluating them. Given the availability of <a href=\"/ea/1ig/four_organizations_eas_should_fully_fund_for_2018/\">alternative</a>&#xA0;<a href=\"/ea/1g1/introducing_fortify_health_an_eaaligned_charity/\">ways</a> of&#xA0;<a href=\"/ea/10b/introducing_envision_a_new_eaaligned_organization/\">announcing</a> <a href=\"/ea/1b1/introducing_sentience_institute/\">projects</a>* and <a href=\"/ea/1ig/four_organizations_eas_should_fully_fund_for_2018/\">endorsing them</a>, there may be relatively few people who would use this system to propose ideas. If so, then the opportunity cost might be greater than the benefits.</p>\n<p>*These may be bad examples&#xA0;of using a public announcement to generate initial funding since many of these seem to have gathered sufficient funding to launch before being announced.</p>\n<p>5. The choice of evaluators could cause hurt feelings for those who are excluded.&#xA0;The&#xA0;rejection of a proposal might cause hurt feelings for the proposer and might even cause them to underestimate their abilities in the future.</p>\n<p>6. The platform could&#xA0;become the default path (to the point that raising money for new projects through other channels is disfavored), which could</p>\n<p>a. entrench the status quo in terms of cause areas and strategies;</p>\n<p>b. make it harder for low probability, high magnitude projects to get funding (if evaluators only endorse projects they think are likely to succeed);</p>\n<p>c. make it harder to quickly launch a project; and</p>\n<p>d. make it harder&#xA0;to launch projects that require some secrecy.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Ultimately, I&apos;m unsure as to whether this would be a good idea. My primary motivation in posting this is to generate more discussion on this topic.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "RandomEA"}}, {"_id": "6NWMo9MgAsTW288uG", "title": "Syllabus for Course on Effective Altruism", "postedAt": "2018-04-25T21:53:36.053Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>Our Philanthropy Advisory Fellowship at Harvard University Effective Altruism Student Group has just published an EA course syllabus that we developed:&#xA0;http://www.harvardea.org/blog/changemakers</p>\n<p>We hope this can be a helpful resource for EA groups at other schools to encourage faculty to create new courses on EA.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "egastfriend"}}, {"_id": "tBovvSWFBWnuBjjzL", "title": "Please Take the 2018 Effective Altruism Survey!

It turns out the skills of forecasting, such as the importance of taking the&#xA0;<a href=\"https://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Outside_view\">outside view</a>&#xA0;into account, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermi_problem\">Fermi estimates </a>and Bayesian updating will be familiar to effective altruists. A lot of the value from the book, then, for readers here would be a summary of insights, so I&apos;ve reproduced the appendix from the book that does just that below.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><span>(1) Triage</span></p>\n<p>Focus on questions where your hard work is likely to pay off. Don&#x2019;t waste time either on &#x201C;clocklike&#x201D; questions (where simple rules of thumb can get you close to the right answer) or on impenetrable &#x201C;cloud-like&#x201D; questions (where even fancy statistical models can&#x2019;t beat the dart-throwing chimp). Concentrate on questions in the Goldilocks zone of difficulty, where effort pays off the most.</p>\n<p><br>For instance, &#x201C;Who will win the presidential election, twelve years out, in 2028?&#x201D; is impossible to forecast now. Don&#x2019;t even try. Could you have predicted in 1940 the winner of the election, twelve years out, in 1952? If you think you could have known it would be a then-unknown colonel in the United States Army, Dwight Eisenhower, you may be afflicted with one of the worst cases of hindsight bias ever documented by psychologists.</p>\n<p>Of course, triage judgment calls get harder as we come closer to home. How much justifiable confidence can we place in March 2015 on who will win the 2016 election? The short answer is not a lot but still a lot more than we can for the election in 2028. We can at least narrow the 2016 field to a small set of plausible contenders, which is a lot better than the vast set of unknown (Eisenhower-ish) possibilities lurking in 2028.</p>\n<p>Certain cases of outcomes have well-deserved reputations for being radically unpredictable (e.g., oil prices, currency markets). But we usually don&#x2019;t discover how unpredictable outcomes are until we have spun our wheels for a while trying to gain analytical traction. Bear in mind the two basic errors it is possible to make here. We could fail to try to predict the potentially predictable or we could waste our time trying to predict the unpredictable. Which error would be worse in the situation you face?</p>\n<p><span>(2)&#xA0;</span><span>Break seemingly intractable problems into tractable sub-problems.</span></p>\n<p>Channel the playful but disciplined spirit of Enrico Fermi who--when he wasn&#x2019;t designing the world&#x2019;s first atomic reaction--loved ballparking answers to head-scratchers such as &#x201C;How many extraterrestrial civilizations exist in the universe?&#x201D; Decompose the problem into its knowable and unknowable parts. Flush ignorance into the open. Expose and examine your assumptions. Dare to be wrong by making you best guesses. Better to discover quickly than to hide them behind vague verbiage.</p>\n<p>Superforecasters see Fermi-izing as part of the job. How else could they generate quantitative answers to seemingly impossible-to-quantify questions about Arafat&#x2019;s autopsy, bird-flu epidemics, oil prices, Boko Haram, the Battle of Aleppo, and bond-yield spreads.</p>\n<p>We find this Fermi-izing spirit at work even in the quest for love, the ultimate unquantifiable. Consider Peter Backus, a lonely guy in London, who guesstimated the number of potential female partners in his vicinity by starting with the population of London (approximately six million) and winnowing the number down by the proportion of women in the population (about 50%), by the proportion of singles (about 50%), by the proportion in the right age range (about 20%), by the proportion of university graduates (about 26%) by the proportion he finds attractive (only 5%), by the proportion likely to find him attractive (only 5%), and by the proportion likely to be compatible with him (about 10%). Conclusion: roughly twenty-six women in the pool, a daunting but not impossible search task.</p>\n<p>There are no objectively correct answers to true-love questions, but we can score the accuracy of the Fermi estimates that superforecasters generate in the IARPA tournaments. The surprise is how often remarkably good probability estimates arise from a remarkably crude series of assumptions and guesstimates.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>(3)&#xA0;</span><span>Strike the right balance between inside and outside views.</span><br><br>Superforecasters know that there is nothing new under the sun. Nothing is 100% &#x201C;unique&#x201D;. Language purists be damned: uniqueness is a matter of degree. So superforecasters for comparison classes even for seemingly unique events, such as the outcome of a hunt for a high-profile terrorist (Joseph Kony) or the standoff between a new socialist government in Athens and Greece&#x2019;s creditors. Superforecasters are in the habit of posing the outside-view question: How often do things of this sort happen in situations of this sort?</p>\n<p><br>So too apparently is Larry Summers, a Harvard professor and former Treasury secretary. He knows about the planning fallacy: when bosses ask employees how long it will take to finish a project, employees tend to underestimate the time they need, often by factors of two or three. Summers suspects his own employees are no different. One former employee, Greg Mankiw, himself now a famous economist, recalls Summers&#x2019;s strategy: he doubled the employee&#x2019;s estimate, then moved to the next higher time unit. &#x201C;So, if the research assistant says the task will take an hour, it will take two days. If he says two days, it will take four weeks.&#x201D; It&#x2019;s a nerd joke: Summers corrected for his employees&#x2019; failure to take the outside view in making estimates by taking the outside view toward employee&#x2019;s estimates, and then inventing a funny correction factor.</p>\n<p><br>Of course Summers would adjust his correction factor if an employee astonished him and delivered on time. He would balance his outside-view expectation of tardiness against the new inside-view evidence that a particular employee is an exception to the rule. Because each of us is, to some degree, unique.</p>\n<p><span>(4)&#xA0;</span><span>Strike the right balance between under- and overreacting to evidence.</span></p>\n<p>Belief updating is to good forecasting as brushing and flossing are to good dental hygiene. It can be boring, occasionally uncomfortable, but it pays off in the long term. That said, don&#x2019;t suppose that belief updating is always easy because sometimes it is. Skillful updating requires teasing subtle signals from noisy news flows--all the while resisting the lure of wishful thinking.</p>\n<p>Savvy forecasters learn to ferret out telltale clues before the rest of us. They snoop for nonobvious lead indicators, about what would have to happen before X could, where X might be anything from an expansion of Arctic sea ice to a nuclear war in the Korean peninsula. Note the fine line here between picking up subtle clues before everyone else and getting suckered by misleading clues. Does the appearance of an article critical of North Korea in the official Chinese press signal that China is about the squeeze Pyongyang hard--or was it just a quirky error in editorial judgment? The best forecasters tend to be incremental belief updaters, often moving the probabilities of, say, 0.4 to 0.35 or from 0.6 to 0.65, distinctions too subtle with vague verbiage, like &#x201C;might&#x201D; or &#x201C;maybe&#x201D;, but distinctions that, in the long run, define the difference between good and great forecasters.</p>\n<p>Yet superforecasters also know how to jump, or move their probability estimates fast in response to diagnostic signals. Superforecasters are not perfect Bayesian updaters but they are better than most of us. And that is largely because they value this skill and work hard at cultivating it.</p>\n<p><span>(5)&#xA0;</span><span>Look for the clashing causal forces at work in each problem.</span></p>\n<p>For every good policy argument, there is typically a counterargument that is at least worth acknowledging. For instance, if you are a devout dove who believes the threatening military action never brings peace, be open to the possibility that you might be wrong about Iran. And the same advice applies if you are a devout hawk who believes that soft &#x201C;appeasement&#x201D; policies never pay off. Each side should list, in advance, the signs that would nudge them toward the other.</p>\n<p>Now here comes the really hard part. In classical dialectics, thesis meets antithesis, producing synthesis. In dragonfly eye, one view meets another and another and another--all of which must be synthesized into a single image. There are no paint-by-number rules here. Synthesis is an art that requires reconciling irreducibly subjective judgments. If you do it well, engaging in this process of synthesizing should transform you from a cookie-cutter dove or hawk into an odd hybrid creature, a dove-hawk, with a nuanced view of when tougher or softer are likelier to work.</p>\n<p><span>(6)&#xA0;</span><span>Strive to distinguish as many degrees of doubt as the problem permits but no more.</span><br><br>Few things are either certain or impossible. And &#x201C;maybe&#x201D; isn&#x2019;t all that informative. So your uncertainty dial needs more than three settings. Nuance matters. The more degrees of uncertainty you can distinguish, the better a forecaster you are likely to be. As in poker, you have an advantage if you are better than your competitors at separating 60/40 bets from 40/60--or 55/45 from 45/55. Translating vague-verbiage hunches into numeric probabilities feels unnatural at first but it can be done. It just requires patience and practice. The superforecasters have shown what is possible.</p>\n<p>Most of us could learn, quite quickly, to think in more granular ways about uncertainty. Recall the episode in which President Obama was trying to figure out whether Osama bin Laden was the mystery occupant of the walled-in compound in Abbottabad. And recall the probability estimates of his intelligence officers and the president&#x2019;s reaction to their estimates: &#x201C;This is fifty-fifty...a flip of the coin.&#x201D; Now suppose that President Obama had been shooting the breeze with basketball buddies and each one offered probability estimates on the outcome of a college game--and those estimates corresponded exactly to those offered by intelligence officers on the whereabouts of Osama bin Laden. Would the president still have shrugged and said, &#x201C;This is fifty-fifty&#x201D;, or would he have said, &#x201C;sounds like the odds fall between three to one and four to one&#x201D;? I bet on the latter. The president is accustomed to granular thinking in the domain of sports. Every year, he enjoys trying to predict the winners of the March Madness basketball tournament, a probability puzzle that draws the attention of serious statisticians. But, like his Democratic and Republican predecessors, he does not apply the same rigor to national security decisions. Why? Because different norms govern different thought processes. Reducing complex hunches to scorable probabilities is de rigueur in sports but not in national security.</p>\n<p>So, don&#x2019;t reserve the rigorous reasoning for trivial pursuits. George Tenet would not have dared utter &#x201C;slam dunk&#x201D; about weapons of mass destruction if the Bush 43 White House had enforced standards of evidence and proof that are second nature to seasoned gamblers on sporting events. Slam dunk implies one is willing to offer infinite odds--and to lose everything if one is wrong.</p>\n<p><span>(7)&#xA0;</span><span>Strike the right balance between under- and overconfidence, between prudence and decisiveness.</span><br><br>Superforecasters understand the risks both of rushing to judgment and of dawdling too near &#x201C;maybe&#x201D;. They routinely manage the trade-off between the need to take decisive stands (who wants to listen to a waffler?) and the need to qualify their stands (who wants to listen to a blowhard?). They realize that long-term accuracy requires getting good scores on both calibration and resolution--which requires moving beyond blame-game ping-pong. It is not enough to just avoid the most recent mistake. They have to find creative ways to tamp down both types of forecasting errors--misses and false alarms--to the degree a fickle world permits such uncontroversial improvements in accuracy.</p>\n<p><span>(8)&#xA0;</span><span>Look for the errors behind your mistakes but beware of rearview-mirror hindsight biases.</span><br><br>Don&#x2019;t try to justify or excuse your failures. Own them! Conduct unflinching postmortems: Where exactly did I go wrong? And remember that although the more common error is to learn too little from failure and to overlook flaws in your basic assumptions, it is also possible to learn too much (you may have been basically on the right track but made a minor technical mistake that had big ramifications). Also don&#x2019;t forget to do postmortems on your successes too. Not all successes imply your reasoning was right. You may have just lucked out by making offsetting errors. And if you keep confidently reasoning along the same lines, you are setting yourself up for a nasty surprise.<br><br><span>(9)&#xA0;</span><span>Bring out the best in others and let others bring out the best in you.&#xA0;</span><br><br>Master the fine arts of team management, especially perspective taking (understanding the arguments of the other side so well that you can reproduce them to the other&#x2019;s satisfaction), precision questioning (helping others to clarify their arguments so they aren&#x2019;t being misunderstood), and constructive confrontation (learning to disagree without being disagreeable). Wise leaders know how fine the line can be between a helpful suggestion and micromanagerial meddling or between a rigid group and a decisive one or between a scatterbrained group or an open-minded one. Tommy Lasorda, the former coach of the Los Angeles Dodgers, got it roughly right: &#x201C;Managing is like holding a dove in your hand. If you hold it too tightly you kill it, but if you hold it too loosely, you lose it.&#x201D;<br><br><span>(10)&#xA0;</span><span>Master the error-balancing bicycle.</span><br><br>Implementing each commandment requires balancing opposing errors. Just as you can&#x2019;t learn to ride a bicycle by reading a physics textbook, you can&#x2019;t become a superforecaster by reading training manuals. Learning requires doing, with good feedback that leaves no ambiguity about whether you are succeeding--&#x201D;I&#x2019;m rolling along smoothly!&#x201D;--or whether you are failing--&#x201D;crash!&#x201D; Also remember that practice is not just going through the motions of making forecasts, or casually reading the news and tossing out probabilities. Like all other known forms of expertise, superforecasting is the product of deep, deliberative practice.</p>\n<p><span>(11)&#xA0;</span><span>Don&#x2019;t treat commandments as commandments.</span><br><br>&#x201C;It is impossible to lay down binding rules,&#x201D; Helmuth von Moltke warned, &#x201C;because two cases will never be exactly the same.&#x201D; As in war, so in all things. Guidelines are the best we can do in a world where nothing is certain or exactly repeatable. Superforecasting requires constant mindfulness, even when--perhaps especially when--you are dutifully trying to follow these commandments.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Citation: Tetlock, Philip E., and Dan Gardner. &quot;Appendix: Ten Commandments for Aspiring Superforecasters.&quot; In&#xA0;<em>Superforecasting</em>, 277-85.

This is not to be confused with changing cause areas or methods of doing good. Value drift has a strong precedent of happening for other related concepts, both ethical things (such as being vegetarian) and things that generally take willpower (such as staying a healthy weight). </p><p>Value drift seems very likely to be a concern for many EAs, and if it were a major concern, it would substantially affect career and donation plans. </p><p>For example, if value drift rarely happens, putting money into a savings account with the intent of donating it might be basically as good as putting it into a donor-advised fund. However, if the risk of value drift is higher, a dollar in a savings account is more likely to later be used for non-altruistic reasons and thus not nearly as good as a dollar put into a donor advised fund, where it\u2019s very hard not to donate it to a registered charity. </p><p>In a career context, a plan such as building career capital for 8 years and then moving into an altruistic job would be considered a much better plan if value drift were rare than if it were common. The more common value drift is, the stronger near-term focused impact plans are relative to longer-term focused impact plans. For example, you might get an entry-level position at a charity and build up capacity by getting work experience. This has the potential, though not always, to be slower at building your CV than getting a degree or working in a low-impact but high-prestige field. However, it has impact right away, which matters more if the risk of value drift is high.</p><br/><h2>The Data</h2><p>Despite the importance of value drift to important questions, it&#x27;s rarely been talked about or studied. One of the reasons it is so under-studied is that it would take a long time to get good data. </p><p>I have been in the EA movement for ~5 years. I decided to pool some data from contacts who I met in my first year of EA. I only included people who would have called themselves EAs for 6 months or longer (I would not include someone who was only into EA for a month and then disappeared), and who and took some sort of EA action (working for an EA org, taking the GWWC pledge, running an EA group). I also only included people who I knew and kept in touch with well enough to know what happened to them (even if they left the EA movement). It is ultimately a convenience sample, but it was based on working for 4 current EA orgs and living in 4 different countries over that time, so it\u2019s not focused on a single location or organization.</p><p>I also broke the groups down into ~10% donors and ~50% donors, because many times I have heard people being more or less concerned about one of these groups vs the other. These broad groups are not just focused on people doing earning to give. Someone who is working heavy hours for an EA organization and making most of their life decisions with EA as their number one priority would be considered in the 50% group. Someone running an EA chapter who makes decisions with EA as a factor, but prioritizes other factors above it, would be put in the 10% group. The percentages are aimed at rough proxies of how important EA is in these people&#x27;s lives, not strictly financial donations. I did not count changing cause areas as value drift (e.g. changing from donating 10% to MIRI to AMF) -- only different levels of overall altruistic involvement. </p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>The results over 5 years are as follows:</p><p><em>16 people were ~50% donors \u2192 \u00a09/16 stayed around 50%</em></p><p><em>22 people were ~10% donors \u2192 8/22 stayed around 10%</em> </p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>No one moved from the 10% category to the 50% category, and I only counted fairly noticeable changes (if someone changed their donations from 50% to 40%, I would not have the resolution to notice). </p><p>Value drift was high across both groups, with roughly 50% of the population drifting over 5 years. I talked to many of those people about value drift and their thoughts on long term altruism, and most of them, like most people I talk to now, had previously been very confident that they would stay altruistic in the long term. Why people generally value drifted was a mix of reasons with no clear consistent source, although life changes were a large factor for many (e.g. people moving from university to the workforce, changing cities or workplaces, marrying or having kids).</p><p>Interestingly, this data also sheds a little light on concerns of \u201cpushing yourself too hard\u201d and vs \u201ctaking it too easy on yourself\u201d, with generally more involved or dedicated people value drifting noticeably less (~30% vs ~60%). </p><br/><h2>Discussion</h2><p>Overall, these results seem pretty scary to me, especially since there\u2019s a natural selection effect where I tend to make friends who are more dedicated and drift apart from the ones who leave the movement. It&#x27;s also worth noting that there have not been particularly major controversies or problems in the EA movement that would cause a lot of value drift over this period of time vs. any other. Historically, many EAs have been young non-family-starters, so we&#x27;ve arguably been seeing a period of artificially low value drift that is not sustainable as the movement gets older and goes through standard life changes. </p><p>Of course, the data could be a lot better quality, and I wish it were measured in a more rigorous way. I would be keen to see any more data that anyone else has along these lines. Despite quality concerns, I still think we can draw some conclusions from it, particularly given that people are already effectively drawing conclusions about the likelihood of value drift from no data at all. I also spoke to a few EAs who have been around the movement awhile, and this data broadly fit their intuitions, which gives me more confidence that it&#x27;s not 100% off the mark. </p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>The implications of this data are that people should be cautious of deferring impact to later, and should set up commitment devices to help them stick to what they care about. </p><p>One example: be wary of building capacity for very long periods of time, particularly if the built capacity is broad and leaves open appealing non-altruist paths. Instead, see if you can build capacity in such a way that it also does good at the moment, such as getting work experience with non-profits. </p><p>For instance, if you want to do direct impact, volunteering for an organization and showing how good your work is is often better than having a degree, especially an unrelated one. It\u2019s also substantially faster and does good directly. Degrees are largely a way to signal that you\u2019re a hard worker with a decent amount of intelligence, and if all you are is a CV in somebody\u2019s inbox, that\u2019s very important. However, if you\u2019ve been working alongside them for months, they\u2019ll already know these traits of yours. </p><p>Another way to build career capacity with value drift in mind is to get experience and credentials that make it harder to work in a non-altruistic area. This could be getting a degree in development economics instead of economics generally, or working for prestigious nonprofits instead of other prestigious organizations. Option value is great if the risk of value drift is low, but if it\u2019s high, it makes it easier for you to slip. It\u2019s like only having healthy food in the house. If the only easy options are also altruistic, you\u2019re much more likely to stick it out in the long haul. </p><p>If your primary path to impact is donations and you want to keep value drift in mind, but you don\u2019t know where you want to give yet, don\u2019t save those donations. Put them into a donor-advised fund. That way, even if you become less altruistic in the future, you can\u2019t back out on the pledged donations and spend it on a fancier wedding or a bigger house. You can also set up monthly donations, or ask your employer to automatically donate a preset portion of your income to charity before you even see it in your bank account. </p><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><p>Overall, if 50% of the EAs I met 5 years ago have value drifted, this should factor into your plans. Nobody thinks they\u2019ll value drift, just like no teenager with a fast metabolism thinks they\u2019ll be the one who gains weight when they hit middle age. By all means, indulge in junk food every once in awhile and don\u2019t constantly stress about calories, but put some time into setting up your life to make it easier for you to reach for a banana instead of the ice cream, or in this case, the altruistic path instead of the less altruistic one. </p><p>For a deeper dive into concrete ways to reduce value drift, check out <a href=\"/ea/1o4/concrete_ways_to_reduce_risks_of_value_drift/\">this post</a>.</p>", "user": {"username": "Joey"}}, {"_id": "6x4yhyKS7bCEauuZv", "title": "Applying EA Measures to Peacebuilding and Violent Conflict", "postedAt": "2018-04-20T18:27:21.409Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>Hey folks,</p>\n<p>As an effective altruist-minded founder, I&apos;ve been working to find ways to bring EA values and measures into a space that is relatively behind in terms of scientific rigor: Peacebuilding.&#xA0; I recently wrote an op-ed outline the scope, neglectedness, and potential for innovation in the field, which you can find on the <a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2018/04/heres-how-we-put-an-end-to-violent-conflict-2901d1f8-8fdc-4db7-b500-4ea539c29b65/\">World Economic Forum website</a>.&#xA0; That&apos;s a great primer for the discussion, which I&apos;ll avoid regurgitating here.</p>\n<p>However, I am not convinced it is enough.&#xA0; I believe a deeper analysis of the problem and solution spaces is deeply needed, and I&apos;d love to bring together some of your great analytical minds to examine the space from an explicitly EA perspective.&#xA0; This includes sizing up the problem in contrast to other issues, and evaluating the potential for impact based on approaches and various parameters.&#xA0; We could develop some white papers to share here and beyond.</p>\n<p>If this interests you, please feel free to comment below or get in touch with me directly.</p>\n<p>Here&apos;s a snapshot of the size of the issue, along with its neglectedness, in economic terms:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://assets.weforum.org/editor/D7aH3GYMzrNtywaDme4lGoDlEhydUAuH1Ic5Axrc6jg.png\"></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "frankfredericks"}}, {"_id": "y3pkt43XsiGmg4Mje", "title": "[Draft] Fighting Aging as an Effective Altruism Cause", "postedAt": "2018-04-16T10:18:23.041Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>Fighting Aging as an Effective Altruism Cause:&#xA0;<span>A Model of the Impact of the Clinical Trials&#xA0;</span><span>of Simple Interventions</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Abstract: The effective altruism movement aims to save lives in the most cost-effective ways.

Fighting aging now increases the number of people who will survive until radical life extension becomes possible. We suggest a simple model, where radical life extension is achieved in 2100, the human population is 10 billion, and life expectancy is increased by simple geroprotectors like metformin by three more years on average, so an additional 250 million people survive until &#x201C;immortality&#x201D;. The cost of clinical trials to prove that metformin is a real geroprotector is $60 million. In this simplified case, the price of a life saved is around 24 cents, 10 000 times cheaper than saving a life from malaria by providing bed nets.

This has always perplexed me, as Will MacAskill wrote in&#xA0;<em>Doing Good Better</em> about the mechanism by which vegetarianism is thought to decrease the supply of meat products. While one may agree or disagree with the claims Will makes, this excerpt can provide the grounds framing the discussion.<br><br></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>Consider ethical consumption, like switching to fair-trade coffee, or reducing how much meat you buy. Suppose someone stops buying chicken breasts, instead choosing vegetarian options, in order to reduce the amount of animal suffering on factory farms. Does that person make a difference? YOu might think not. If one person decides against buying chicken breast one day but the rest of the meat eaters on the planet continue to buy chicken, how could that possibly affect how many chickens are killed for human consumption? When a supermarket decides how much chicken to buy, they don&#x2019;t care that one fewer breast was purchased on a given day. However, if thousands or millions of people stopped buying chicken breasts, the number of chickens raised for food would decrease--supply would fall to meet demand. But then we&#x2019;re left with a paradox: individuals can&#x2019;t make a difference, but millions of individuals do. But the actions of millions of people are just the sum of the actions of many individual people. Moreover, an iron law of economics is that, in a well-functioning market, if demand for a product decreases, the quantity of the product that&#x2019;s supplied decreases. How, then, can we reconcile these thoughts?</span></p>\n<p><span>The answer lies with expected value. If you decline to buy some chicken breast, then most of the time you&#x2019;ll make no difference: the supermarket will buy the same amount of chicken in the future. Sometimes, however, you will make a difference. Occasionally, the manager of the store will assess the number of chicken breasts bought by consumers and decide to decrease their intake of stock, even though they wouldn&#x2019;t have done so had the number of chicken breasts bought by consumers and decide to decrease their intake of stock, even though they wouldn&#x2019;t have done so had the number of chicken breasts been one higher. (Perhaps they follow a rule like: &#x201C;If fewer than five thousand chicken breasts were bought this month, decrease stock intake.&#x201D;) And when the manager does decide to decrease their stock intake, they will decrease stock by a large amount. Perhaps your decision against purchasing chicken breast will have an effect on the supermarket only one in a thousand times, but in that one time, the store manager will decide to purchase approximately one thousand fewer chicken breasts.</span></p>\n<p><span>This isn&#x2019;t just a theoretical argument. Economists have studies this issue and worked out how, on average, a consumer affects the number of animal products supplied by declining to buy that product. They estimate, on average, if you give up one egg, total production ultimately fassl by 0.91 eggs; if you give up one gallon of milk, total production falls by 0.56 gallons. Other products are somewhere in between: economists estimate if you give up one pound of beef, beef production falls by 0.68 pounds; if you give up one pound of pork, production ultimately falls by 0.74 pounds; if you give up one pound of chicken, production ultimately falls by 0.76 pounds. </span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span><span>MacAskill, William, Ph.D. &quot;Why Voting Is Like Donating Thousands of Dollars to Charity.&quot; In&#xA0;</span><em>Doing Good Better: How Effective Altruism Can Help You Make A Difference</em><span>, 87-88.

One crucial assumption made is a &apos;total&apos; or &apos;no-difference&apos; view of population ethics: in sketch, it is just as good to bring a person into existence with a happy life for 50 years as it is to add fifty years of happy life to someone who already exists. Thus the 10<sup>lots&#xA0;</sup>of potential people give profound moral weight to the cause of x-risk reduction.<br><br>Population ethics is infamously recondite, and so disagreement with this assumption commonplace; many find at least some form of person affecting/asymmetrical view plausible: that the value of &apos;making happy people&apos; is either zero, or at least much lower than the value of making people happy.&#xA0;Such a view would remove a lot of the upside of x-risk reduction, as most of its value (by the lights of the total view) is ensuring a great host of happy potential people exist.<br><br>Yet even if we discount the (forgive me) person-<em>effecting</em> benefit, extinction would still entail vast person-affecting harm.&#xA0;There are 7.6 billion people alive today, and 7.6 billion premature deaths would be deemed a considerable harm by most. Even fairly small (albeit non-pascalian) reductions in the likelihood of extinction could prove highly cost-effective.<br><br>To my knowledge, no one has &apos;crunched the numbers&apos; on the expected value of x-risk reduction by the lights of person affecting views. So I&apos;ve thrown together a guestimate as a first-pass estimate.</p>\n<h1>An estimate&#xA0;</h1>\n<p>The (forward) <a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/10633\">model</a> goes like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>There are currently 7.6 billion people alive on earth. The worldwide mean age is 38, and worldwide life expectancy is 70.5.&#xA0;</li>\n<li>Thus, very naively, if &apos;everyone died tomorrow&apos;, the average number of life years lost per person is 32.5, and the total loss is 247 Billion life years.</li>\n<li>Assume the extinction risk is 1% over this century, uniform by year (i.e. the risk this year is 0.0001, ditto the next one, and so on.)</li>\n<li>Also assume the tractability of x-risk reduction is something like (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28806130\">borrowing</a> from Millett and Snyder-Beattie) this: &apos;There&apos;s a project X that is expected to cost 1 billion dollars each year, and would reduce the risk (proportionately) by 1% (i.e. if we spent a billion each year this century, xrisk over this century declines from 1% to 0.99%).</li>\n<li>This gives a risk-reduction per year of around 1.3 * 10<sup>-6</sup>&#xA0;, and so an expected value of around 330 000 years of life saved.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Given all these things, the model spits out a mean &apos;cost per life year&apos; of <strong>$1500-$26000&#xA0;</strong>(mean $9200).&#xA0;</p>\n<h1>Caveats and elaborations</h1>\n<p>The limitations of this are nigh-innumerable, but I list a few of the most important below an approximately ascending order.</p>\n<p>Zeroth: The model has a wide range of uncertainty, and reasonable sensitivity to distributional assumptions: you can modulate mean estimate and range by a factor of 2 or so by whether the distributions used are Beta, log normal, or tweaking their variance.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>First: Adjustment to give &apos;cost per DALY/QALY&apos; would be somewhat downward, although not dramatically (a factor of 2 would imply everyone who continues to live does so with a disability weight of 0.5, in the same ballpark as those used for major depression or blindness).</p>\n<p>Second, trends may have a large impact, although their importance is modulated by which person-affecting view is assumed. I deliberately set up the estimate to work in a &apos;one shot&apos; single year case (i.e. the figure applies to a &apos;spend 1B to reduce extinction risk in 2018 from 0.0001 to 0.000099&apos; scenario). <br><br>By the lights of a person-affecting view which considers only people who exist <em>now</em>, making the same investment 10 years from now (i.e. spent 1B to reduce extinction risk in <em>2028</em> from 0.0001 to 0.000099) is less attractive, as some of these people would have died, and the new people who have replaced them have little moral relevance. These views thus imply a fairly short time horizon, and are particularly sensitive to x-risk in the near future. Given the &apos;1%&apos; per century is probably not uniform by year, and plausibly lower now but higher later, this would imply a further penalty to cost-effectiveness.</p>\n<p>Other person affecting views consider people who will necessarily exist (however cashed out) rather than whether they happen to exist now (planting a bomb with a timer of 1000 years is still accrues person-affecting harm). In a &apos;extinction in 100 years&apos; scenario, this view would still count the harm of everyone alive then who dies, although still discount the foregone benefit of people who &apos;could have been&apos; subsequently in the moral calculus.&#xA0;<br><br>Thus the trends in factual basis become more salient. One example is the ongoing demographic transition, and the consequently older population give smaller values of life-years saved if protected from extinction in the future. This would probably make the expected cost-effectiveness somewhat (but not dramatically) worse.</p>\n<p>A lot turns on the estimate for marginal &apos;x-risk reduction&apos;. I think the numbers offered in terms of base rate, and how much it can be reduced for now much lean on the conservative side of the consensus of far-future EAs. Confidence in (implied) scale or tractability an order of magnitude impose commensurate increases on the risk estimate. Yet in such circumstances the bulk of disagreement is explained by empirical disagreement rather than a different take on the population ethics.</p>\n<p>Finally, this only accounts for something like the (welfare) &apos;face value&apos; of existential risk reduction. There would be some further benefits by the light of the person-affecting view itself, or ethical views which those holding a person affecting view are likely sympathetic to: extinction might impose other harms beyond years of life lost; there could be person affecting benefits if some of those who survive can enjoy extremely long and happy lives; and there could be non-welfare goods on an objective list which rely on non-extinction (among others). On the other side, those with non-deprivationists accounts of the badness of death may still discount the proposed benefits.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>Notwithstanding these challenges, I think the model, and the result that the &apos;face value&apos; cost-effectiveness of x-risk reduction is still pretty good, is instructive.<br><br>First, there is a common pattern of thought along the lines of, &quot;X-risk reduction only matters if the total view is true, and if one holds a different view one should basically discount it&quot;. Although rough, this cost-effectiveness guestimate suggests this is mistaken. Although it seems unlikely x-risk reduction is the <em>best</em> buy from the lights of a person-affecting view (we should be <a href=\"/ea/st/beware_surprising_and_suspicious_convergence/\">suspicious</a> if it were), given ~$10000 per life year compares unfavourably to best global health interventions, it is still a <em>good</em> buy: it compares favourably to marginal cost effectiveness for rich country healthcare spending, for example.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Second, although it seems unlikely that x-risk reduction would be the best buy by the lights of a person affecting view, this would not be wildly outlandish. Those with a person-affecting view who think x-risk is particularly likely, or that the cause area has easier wins available than implied in the model, might find the best opportunities to make a difference. It may therefore supply reason for those with such views to investigate the factual matters in greater depth, rather than ruling it out based on their moral commitments.<br><br>Finally, most should be morally uncertain in matters as recondite as population ethics. Unfortunately, how to address moral uncertainty is similarly recondite. If x-risk reduction is &apos;good but not the best&apos; rather than &apos;worthless&apos; by the lights of person affecting views, this likely implies x-risk reduction looks more valuable whatever the size of the &apos;person affecting party&apos; in one&apos;s moral parliament.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Gregory_Lewis"}}, {"_id": "bEPBMu2wB2DE4kaku", "title": "Comparative advantage in the talent market ", "postedAt": "2018-04-11T23:48:56.176Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>The concept of <a href=\"/(https:/concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/comparative-advantage/)\">comparative advantage</a> is well known within the Effective Altruism community. For donations, it is reasonably well known and implemented, think of <a href=\"/ea/15g/small_donors_can_plan_to_make_better_bets_than/\">donor lotteries</a> or donation trading across countries to take better advantage of tax exemptions.</p>\n<p>In this post I&#x2019;m outlining how the idea of comparative advantage can be applied to the talent market.</p>\n<p>The first part will be about some general implications of differences between people and how talent should be allocated accordingly.&#xA0;In the second part I will argue that EAs should prioritise personal fit for deciding what to work on, even if this means working in a cause area that they don&#x2019;t consider a top priority. Finally, I&#x2019;ll consider some common objections to this.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>How people differ in the talent market</h2>\n<p>In the talent market, there are differences among many more dimensions than in the donation market. People have different skills, different levels of experience, different preferences for hours worked, geographical locations, pay and their flexibility with regards to those, different levels of risk aversion in terms of career capital and different preferences for cause areas.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Let&#x2019;s look at differences in comparative advantages in skill. Imagine two people are interested in solving factory farming. One of them has a biology degree and a lot of experience as an anti-factory-farming activist, while the other one has a history degree and only a bit of experience as an activist. Due to the principle of comparative advantage it is still best for the experienced activist to go into meat replacement research and the less experienced activist into advocacy.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>However, this argument depends on how scarce talent in advocacy and meat replacement research are relative to each other. If the world had an excessive amount of people capable to do good meat replacement research (which it does not) but a shortage of anti factory farming activists, our activism experienced biologist should go into advocacy too.</p>\n<p>In general, when we think about comparative advantage and how to allocate talent, this is a good heuristic to use: which traits are we short of in the talent market? If you have one of those traits, maybe you should go in and fill the gap.</p>\n<p>For example, we are currently short of <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/operations-management/\">operations talent</a>. The post by 80,000 hours mentions that even if you&#x2019;re as good as research as other EAs, you should still consider taking on an operations role given our current lack of EAs in operations.</p>\n<p>Also, we currently lack people in biorisk, so even if you consider AI Safety a more important cause area than biorisk, maybe you should go into biorisk assuming you have an appropriate skill set.</p>\n<p>It also seems likely that we don&#x2019;t have enough people willing to start big new projects which are likely to fail. If you&#x2019;re unusually risk neutral, don&#x2019;t mind working long hours and can deal with the prospect of likely failure, you should consider taking on one of those, even if you think you&#x2019;d be just as good as other EAs at research or earning to give.</p>\n<p>Something to keep in mind here is which reference class we are using to think about people&#x2019;s comparative advantages. Since we want to allocate talent across the EA community, the reference class that usually makes most sense to use is the EA Community. This is less true if there are people outside the EA Community filling roles the EA Community thinks should be filled, i.e. it is possible to replace EAs with non-EAs. An example would be development economists working at large international organisations like the UN. Given that the world already has a decent amount of them, we aren&#x2019;t in so much need to fill those roles with EAs.</p>\n<p>However, we can also err by thinking about a too narrow reference class. People, including EAs, are prone to comparing themselves to people they spend most time with (or people who look most impressive on Facebook). This is a problem because people tend to cluster with people who are most like them. So when they should be thinking about what their comparative advantage is within the EA community, they might accidentally think of their comparative advantage among their EA friends instead.</p>\n<p>If all your EA friends are into starting new EA projects just like you, but you think they&#x2019;re much better than you at it, your comparative advantage across the whole of EA might still be to start new EA projects. This is true especially given the lack of people able and willing to start good new projects.</p>\n<p>I think EAs using inconsistent reference classes to judge comparative advantage in the talent market is a common error and we should try harder to avoid it.</p>\n<p>Some considerations for comparative advantage in the talent market are already well known and implemented. People are well aware that it makes more sense for someone early in their career to do a major career switch than for someone who is already experienced in a particular field. This is a message that has been communicated by 80,000 Hours for a long time. It is common sense anyway.</p>\n<p>However, there are some strategies to allocate talent better which aren&#x2019;t implemented enough apart from EAs just not thinking enough about comparative advantage. Some people who would be a good fit for high impact jobs outside the corporate sector are put off by their low pay. If you have no other obligations and don&#x2019;t mind a frugal lifestyle, these positions are a relatively better fit for you. But if you&#x2019;re not and would be a good fit otherwise, negotiating for higher pay with your prospective employer fails, then one option is to try to find a donor to supplement your income. (This is not only a nice theory, I know of cases of this happening.)</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Cooperating in the talent market across cause areas</h2>\n<p>There&#x2019;s another argument about allocating talent in the talent market which I think is severely underappreciated: People should be willing to work in cause areas which aren&#x2019;t their top pick or even ones they don&#x2019;t find compelling, if according to their personal fit a role in those cause areas is their comparative advantage within the EA community. Our talent would be allocated much better and we would thus increase our impact as a community.</p>\n<p>Consider the argument on a small scale, with Allison and Bettina trying to make career decisions:</p>\n<p>Allison considers animal suffering the most important cause area. She&#x2019;s familiar with the arguments outlining the danger of the development of AGI. But she is not that convinced. Allison&#x2019;s main area of competence is her Machine Learning PhD and her policy background. Given her experience, she could be a good fit for AI technical safety research or AI policy.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Bettina however is trained in economics and has been a farm animal activist in the past. However, she&#x2019;s suddenly a lot less convinced animal suffering is the most important cause area and thinks AI is vastly more important.</p>\n<p>Allison might well do fine starting working on abolishing factory farming and Bettina might well find an acceptable position in the AI field. But probably Allison would do much better working on AI and Bettina would do much better working on abolishing factory farming. If they cooperate with each other and switch places, their combined impact will be much higher, regardless of how valuable work on AI Safety or abolishing factory farming really is.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The same principle extends to the whole of the EA community. Our impact as a community will be higher if we are willing to allocate talent according to their comparative advantages across the whole of EA (&#x2018;talent trading&#x2019;) and not just individual causes.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>There are two main counter arguments I&#x2019;ll consider, which are the ones I&#x2019;ve most often heard argued. One argument is that people wouldn&#x2019;t be motivated enough to excel in their job if they don&#x2019;t believe their job is the best they can do according to their own values. The other argument I&#x2019;ve heard is &#x2018;people just don&#x2019;t do that&#x2019;. I think this one has actually more merit than people realise.</p>\n<p>Most notably though, I have not yet encountered much disagreement on theoretical grounds.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>&apos;People wouldn&apos;t be motivated enough.&apos;</h3>\n<p>It does seem true that people need to be motivated to do well in their job. However, I&#x2019;m less convinced people need to believe their job is the best they can personally do according to their own values to have that motivation. Many people in the Effective Altruism community have switched cause areas at least once, their motivation must be somewhat malleable.</p>\n<p>Personally, I&#x2019;m not very motivated to work on animal suffering considering all the human suffering and extinction risk there is. I don&#x2019;t think this is unfixable though. Watching videos of animals in factory farms would likely do the trick. I&#x2019;ve also found working in this area more compelling since listening to the <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/lewis-bollard-end-factory-farming/\">80,000 hours podcast with Lewis Bollard</a>. He presented abolishing factory farming as a more intellectually interesting problem than I had previously considered it.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>However, I think it&#x2019;s rare that lack of motivation is people&#x2019;s <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/TGux5Fhcd7GmTfNGC/is-that-your-true-rejection\">true rejection</a>. If it was, I&#x2019;d expect to see many more people talking about how we could &#x2018;hack&#x2019; our motivation better.</p>\n<p>In case lack of motivation does turn out to be the main reason people don&#x2019;t do enough talent trading across cause areas, I think there are more actions we could take to deal with it.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>&apos;People don&apos;t do that.&apos;&#xA0;</h3>\n<p>The argument in favor of talent trading across cause areas requires people to actually cooperate. The reason the Effective Altruism Community doesn&#x2019;t cooperate enough in its talent market might well be that we&#x2019;re stuck in a defecting <a href=\"https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/concepts/game-theory/\">nash equilibrium</a>. People in the EA Community know other people don&#x2019;t go into cause areas they don&#x2019;t fancy, so they aren&#x2019;t willing to do it either. There are potential solutions to this: setting up a better norm and facilitating explicit trades.</p>\n<p>We can set up a better norm by changing the social rewards and expectations. It is admirable if someone works in a cause area that isn&#x2019;t their top pick. If we observe people cooperating, other people will cooperate too. If you are doing direct work in a cause area that isn&#x2019;t your top pick, you might want to consider becoming more public about this fact. There is a fair number of people who don&#x2019;t work in their top pick cause area or even cause areas they are much less convinced of than their peers, but currently they don&#x2019;t advertise this fact.</p>\n<p>At the very least, as a community we should be able to extend the cause areas people are willing to work in even if we won&#x2019;t have everyone willing to work in cause areas they&#x2019;re pretty unconvinced of.</p>\n<p>One way to get to a better norm is to facilitate explicit talent trades, akin to doing donation trades. To set up donation trades, people ask others for connections, either in their local EA network or online, or they contact CEA to get matched with major donors.</p>\n<p>We can do the same for trading talent. People thinking about working in another cause area can ask around whether there&#x2019;s someone considering switching to a cause area preferred by them. However, trading places in this scenario brings major practical challenges, so it is likely not viable in most cases.</p>\n<p>A more easily implementable solution is to search for a donor willing to offset a cause area switch, i.e. make a donation to the cause area the talent will be leaving.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>There might also be good arguments against the concept of talent trading across cause areas on theoretical or practical grounds that I haven&#x2019;t listed here. A cynical interpretation why people aren&#x2019;t willing enough to cooperate across cause areas might be that people consider their cause area their &#x2018;tribe&#x2019; they want to signal allegiance to and only want to appear smart and dedicated to the people within that cause area.</p>\n<p>All that said, people&#x2019;s motivations, talent and values are correlated so there&#x2019;s a limit on how much the theoretical argument in favour of working in other cause areas will apply.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Which arguments against cooperating in the talent market across cause areas can you think of? Do you think people are considering their comparative advantages in the talent market enough, whether within or across cause areas? What are dimensions people can differ on in the talent market with practical implications that I haven&#x2019;t listed?</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong> If we want to allocate our talent in the EA community well, we need to consider people&#x2019;s comparative advantages across various dimensions, especially the ones that have a major impact on their personal fit. People should be more willing to work in cause areas that don&#x2019;t match their cause area preferences if they have a big comparative advantage in personal fit there.<br><br><br></p>\n<p>Special thanks goes to Jacob Hilton who reviewed a draft of this post.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Denise_Melchin"}}, {"_id": "tNfDWLzBMi9HnoTkE", "title": "UK Income Tax & Donations", "postedAt": "2018-04-08T11:40:05.029Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>For anyone donating their income, being aware of tax rules and making proper use of available deductions can result in significantly increased&#xA0;donations. There are some existing resources on US tax rules (e.g. <a href=\"https://www.benkuhn.net/giving-101\">Ben Kuhn&apos;s post</a>), but I hadn&apos;t come across any for UK tax rules yet.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>So in the hope of saving someone else (and future me!) some time, here&apos;s my current understanding. If you&apos;d like to share this with others, there&apos;s a less EA-oriented version of this post on my <a href=\"https://harald.co/2018/03/18/donations-and-tax/\">personal blog</a>.

Scotland has different rates.&#xA0;</em></p>\n<p><strong>Summary:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>UK charitable donations are fully tax-deductible.*</li>\n<li>Some of the tax relief can go to your chosen charity automatically (i.e. &apos;Gift Aid&apos;).</li>\n<li>You might be eligible for extra tax relief, which you can claim back by asking HMRC to reduce your tax bill.</li>\n<li>Extra tax relief can be significant! Depending on your tax rate, tax relief can give you a <strong>1.25x-2.5x donation multiplier</strong>.</li>\n<li>There&apos;s some flexibility around which tax year you account for donations in.&#xA0; If you&apos;re earning less this year than last year you might be able to significantly reduce your tax bill this way!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>One key income bracket is &#xA3;100-123.7k. If you&apos;re in this bracket, you&apos;re paying an effective marginal tax rate of 60%! So for example you could make a &#xA3;20k donation by giving up only &#xA3;8k.&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>&#xA0;</h2>\n<h2><strong>How UK Income Tax Works</strong></h2>\n<p>UK income tax is progressive, i.e. increases with income.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://hcarlens.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/capture.png\" alt=\"Capture\"></p>\n<p><em>UK income tax brackets 2018/2019 (<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates\">source</a>)</em></p>\n<p>The chart below shows what total income tax looks like for various income levels, and how that breaks down into the various bands. I&apos;ve included data up to &#xA3;200k since beyond that it just goes up linearly, and if you&apos;re in that band you&#xA0;might consider investing in proper tax advice!</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://hcarlens.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/chart-3.png\" alt=\"chart (3).png\">&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p0qG9msYYrYhlj6jOS9a9FOhl85KzB_sgUMRC1iNFNQ/edit#gid=294055911\">Interactive version of this chart</a>.</em></p>\n<p>A few things you&apos;ll notice about the chart:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you earn less than &#xA3;11.85k per year, you pay no tax.</li>\n<li>As you go further to the right from there, you always pay more tax overall.</li>\n<li>The top line generally gets steeper as you go right, but this isn&apos;t true everywhere.</li>\n<li>The steepest part of the chart is between &#xA3;100k and &#xA3;123.7k, where <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/income-tax-rates/income-over-100000\">you gradually lose your personal allowance</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The steepness of that top line represents your marginal tax rate - i.e. how much tax you&apos;ll pay on every extra &#xA3;1 you earn at that level. This is a useful thing to look at, because it affects the &apos;donation multiplier&apos; you&apos;ll get at that level - i.e. how much your chosen charity will get for every &#xA3;1 in net income you give up.</p>\n<p>Here&apos;s another chart which shows that relationship more clearly:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://hcarlens.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/chart-4.png\" alt=\"UK Income Tax - Rate &amp;amp; Donation Multiplier\"></p>\n<p><em><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p0qG9msYYrYhlj6jOS9a9FOhl85KzB_sgUMRC1iNFNQ/edit#gid=962588745\">Interactive version of this chart</a>.&#xA0;</em></p>\n<p>What does this second chart show?&#xA0;The yellow line shows the donation multiplier for &#xA3;1 at each level:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>When you earn below &#xA3;11.85k, your donation multiplier is x1. This makes sense, since there&apos;s no tax to deduct. For every &#xA3;1 you give to charity, you lose &#xA3;1.</li>\n<li>When you earn &#xA3;11.85k-&#xA3;46.35k, your donation multiplier is x1.25. In this bracket your tax deduction is fully taken care of by Gift Aid, so all you have to do is remember to tick that box when you donate and the charity gets an extra 25% directly from the government.</li>\n<li>In the bracket &#xA3;46.35k-100k and again from &#xA3;123.7k-&#xA3;150k, your donation multiplier is x1.67. At this point the 25% in Gift Aid doesn&apos;t fully cover your tax deduction, so you get to claim back some extra tax from HMRC (see below for more on how to do this).</li>\n<li>At &#xA3;100k-&#xA3;123.7k, not only are you in the <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/how-rich-am-i/?country=GBR&amp;income=100000&amp;adults=1&amp;children=0\">top 0.1% of global earners</a>, but you&apos;ve hit the <em>donation multiplier sweet spot&#xA0;</em>of <strong>x2.5</strong>. You can more than double your money with every donation! This is because you&apos;d be paying 40% in tax while your personal allowance would be reduced by 50p for every &#xA3;1 increase in your salary, resulting in an effective 60% marginal tax rate. Again, you&apos;ll get to claim back a lot of tax on any donations.</li>\n<li>Beyond &#xA3;150k - congrats! <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/how-rich-am-i/?country=GBR&amp;income=150000&amp;adults=1&amp;children=0\">You&apos;re comfortably in the top 0.1% of the global population, earning almost 150x the global average salary</a>. Not only that, your donation multiplier is x1.8, so you only give up 55p for every &#xA3;1 you give to charity. And giving to charity <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/pension-schemes-work-out-your-tapered-annual-allowance\">can raise your tax-free pension allowance</a>.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>&#xA0;</h2>\n<h2><strong>How to claim tax back</strong></h2>\n<p>If you&apos;re a basic rate taxpayer (i.e. your total taxable income is up to &#xA3;46.35k) then you don&apos;t need to worry about claiming tax back - Gift Aid takes care of it.</p>\n<p>Beyond that there are three options I&apos;m aware of: Payroll Giving, doing a tax return, or asking HMRC to change your tax code.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/payroll-giving\">Payroll Giving</a> is great, but your employer needs to be set up for it. If they are, then all you need to do is tell your employer your intended monthly donation. They&apos;ll take it straight out of your gross salary and give it to your charity of choice, without any tax being deducted.</p>\n<p>If you fill in a <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-tax-returns\">Self Assessment tax return</a>, there&apos;s a section on charitable donations. Doing one isn&apos;t exactly fun, but it&apos;s not as difficult as it sounds (and I&apos;ve heard it&apos;s much easier than the US system!). All your employer&apos;s data will be imported already, so you only need to fill in additional details on your donations and any other relevant sections. If you&apos;re doing regular donations then the next option is probably better for you, but if you want to be able to do things like optimising the tax year of your donations then you&apos;ll need to fill in a Self Assessment tax return. And <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/self-assessment-tax-returns/who-must-send-a-tax-return\">if you earn over &#xA3;100k you&apos;ll have to do one anyway</a>.</p>\n<p>Until fairly recently, I thought those were the only two options. It turns out there&apos;s a third one! If you give regularly and don&apos;t fancy filling in a tax return, you can just ask HMRC to change your tax code. All you need to do is tell them how much you&apos;re donating every month, and they&apos;ll change your tax code to increase your personal allowance - thereby reducing the amount of tax you&apos;ll pay. I think you can probably do this over the phone, but I found their <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/online-services-helpdesk\">online chat</a> function easy enough. (obviously always make sure you keep a record of all your donations)</p>\n<h2>&#xA0;</h2>\n<h2><strong>When to claim tax back</strong></h2>\n<p>There&apos;s a pretty useful rule which can allow you to claim tax back on donations made now as if they were made in the previous tax year (assuming you&apos;re filling in a Self Assessment tax return). This is great if:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>you&apos;re earning a lot this year, but unsure on where/how much you want to donate. You could hold off on donating until just before you submit your tax return.&#xA0;</li>\n<li>you paid a higher marginal tax rate last year than you expect to pay this year, so could increase your effective donation by submitting it in last year&apos;s tax return.&#xA0;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Why does this work?&#xA0;When you fill in a Self Assessment tax return, you do that for the previous tax year (April-April). And you have until January 31 in the following year to do this (i.e.&#xA0;almost 10 months after the end of the tax year).</p>\n<p>You&apos;re allowed to account for donations made in the current year as if they happened last year. <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/donating-to-charity/gift-aid\">Specifically</a>: &quot;you can also claim tax relief on donations you make in the current tax year (up to the date you send your return) if you either: want tax relief sooner, or won&#x2019;t pay higher rate tax in current year, but you did in the previous year&quot;.</p>\n<h2>&#xA0;</h2>\n<h2><strong>Other things to consider</strong></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Which charities will <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/best-charity/\">maximise the impact of your donations</a>?</li>\n<li>Should you <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/should-you-wait/\">give now or give later</a>?</li>\n<li>How much should you give right now? Hopefully this post helps&#xA0;clarify&#xA0;the tax aspects of that.

Many people have signed the <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/\">Giving What We Can pledge</a> to donate 10% or more of their income for the rest of their lives.</li>\n<li>Could you donate appreciated assets (like property, shares, or <a href=\"https://www.fidelitycharitable.org/giving-account/what-you-can-donate/donating-bitcoin-to-charity.shtml\">bitcoin</a>) instead of income?

Others were already familiar with EA basics. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h1><span>Design principles</span></h1>\n<p><strong><span>Establish epistemic standards</span></strong><span><strong>.</strong> It helps to establish epistemic standard early. By epistemic standard we mean rational reasoning, cooperative solving of disagreements, asking about unclear things, and independent evaluation of evidence and arguments.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Mixing.</span></strong>&nbsp;The natural order of things in social groups tends to be <span><a href=\"http://www.ehbonline.org/article/0162-3095(83)90009-2/fulltext\">assortative matching</a></span>.<span>&nbsp;In the case of an EA retreat, it may mean the more senior members talking more among themselves, and the new members also. This should be prevented. As a lot of things are best learned by osmosis and implicitly, it makes a lot of sense to arrange the activities in such a way that there are opportunities for this to happen.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dramatic_structure\">Dramatic arc</a></span>.</strong>&nbsp;People enjoy an event more if it fits human-compatible narrative structure<span>. For example, if you imagine the intellectual intensity or the emotional intensity as the function of time, it can build up, have some climax, fall down, have some much small peak just before the end.</span></p>\n<p><span><img title=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995993/mirroredImages/r8Qv7QHjJyafmiLnp/aqbjfymjlypd05nekktx.png\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong><span>Rhythm.</span></strong>&nbsp;Hard to describe formally, but if activities are structured in a good way, people get closer to the state of flow, are less tired, learn better. &nbsp;Think about the state of mind you want the participants to be<span>&nbsp;after an activity, and if the next activity fits.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Establish </span><span><a href=\"https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/9QxnfMYccz9QRgZ5z/the-costly-coordination-mechanism-of-common-knowledge\">common topics and knowledge</a></span></strong><span>.</span><span>&nbsp;Unstructured talk in coffee breaks is often the best part of scientific conferences, but the talks are indispensable for establishing common topics and knowledge about topics.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Do not be afraid of intensity.</strong> </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Avoid classroom look&amp;feel </span></strong><span>&nbsp;Classrooms tend to induce some unfortunate mind-states. (At least since 14th-century) </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span><img title=\"\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995993/mirroredImages/r8Qv7QHjJyafmiLnp/l9gfzzxeo75ni7uz5cgl.jpg\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n<h1><span>Program</span></h1>\n<p>Guided by the goals, we brainstormed an overabundance of activities. Guided by the design principles, we created a program. We re-checked if the program seemed<span>&nbsp;to be aligned with the goals. (About \u00bd of the initial ideas did not get into the final program)</span></p>\n<p><span>Here we list all the activities, our reasoning for their inclusion, their rating by the participants on 4 scales - total utility, fun, learning new ideas, and networking (U,F,L,N). Sometimes we comment on experience gained after the event from feedback form or our impressions. The graphs adjacent to the topics show rating on a scale from 1 (bad) to 5 (good), to emphasize the difference the scale of the plots is from 1.5 to 4.8.</span></p>\n<p><span>We hope it will be inspirational, but definitely should be changed based on goals of your event, the audience, and unique opportunities arising from the people present. We hope the feedback scores could work as a rough guide how an activity may help a specific goal.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Friday</span></h2>\n<h4><span>Dinner (18:20-19:20) </span></h4>\n<p>We paid&nbsp;for a high quality all vegan food.

I&apos;ve donated there in the past, and encouraged others to do so, and I&#x2019;m glad CEA is putting time into the programme.<br><br>However, there are some issues with the way the funds are run. My concerns summarised:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>The funds hand out money very infrequently</strong>, and hold onto money for long periods of time. This erodes the value of the fund through time discounting. EA orgs have stated that they value donations in a year&apos;s time at a 12% discount to receiving them now[1], so this represents a substantial cost.</li>\n<li><strong>The funds hold their money as cash</strong>, forgoing any potential interest the money could earn.</li>\n<li><strong>There is no schedule as to when the money will be handed out</strong>. This lack of transparency is troubling, and prevents donors making informed choices (e.g. to give directly to charities instead of waiting).</li>\n<li>(a weaker objection) As the funds hold onto donations for so long, <strong>the chances of the fund manager&apos;s and donors&#x2019; intentions drifting apart is high</strong>.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My suggested improvements:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Disburse funds regularly (e.g. once every three months).</li>\n<li>If they&#x2019;re not being disbursed, hold funds in low-risk investments (e.g. government bonds), not cash.</li>\n<li>Be transparent about future plans and realistic about fund managers&#x2019; capacity to administer the fund.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Waiting to hand out money erodes its value &#x2013; so disburse at a regular cadence</h3>\n<p>EA Funds currently holds $1.1million in cash. From the EA Funds website, here is the amount of money unallocated in each fund, followed by the percentage of the total donations that fund has received which remain unallocated (thanks to Peter Hurford for the idea):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Global Development: $497,957 [49% of all money it has ever received]</li>\n<li>Long-Term Future: $348,167 [95%]</li>\n<li>EA Community: $206,271 [71%]</li>\n<li>Animal Welfare: $75,109 [18%] &#x2013; though it&apos;s about to make a disbursement</li>\n</ul>\n<p>EA organisations surveyed at the end of 2017 said their average discount rate on donations was 12% per year[1] &#x2013; so the funds holding onto donations instead of handing them out has a considerable cost. Whether this discount rate is accurate is another question &#x2013; given the relative abundance of cash available to EA orgs (through OpenPhil and Good Ventures), a rate as high as this is surprising.</p>\n<h3>Funds are held as cash &#x2013; invest them if they&#x2019;re not being disbursed</h3>\n<p>I&apos;ve confirmed with CEA that the money in the funds is held as cash, and not invested. If it was held in e.g. US Treasury bonds, it could be earning 1~2% per year at no risk[2].<br><br>Keeping the funds liquid does have benefits &#x2013; namely, allowing fund managers to make disbursements at short notice &#x2013; but I don&#x2019;t foresee that option being exercised often. I also admit that it isn&apos;t &quot;free&quot; to invest the money in bond, in that there&apos;s operational overhead involved, but with such a large amount of money held it seems worthwhile.</p>\n<h3>A lack of transparency is bad &#x2013; be clear about fund manager bandwidth</h3>\n<p>It seems like the irregular disbursements from the funds are down largely to fund managers not having sufficient time on their hands &#x2013; and having much more pressing commitments (e.g. managing big chunks of Open Phil&#x2019;s budget!).<br><br>The funds could take a similar approach to Giving What We Can &#x2013; allocate funds to the top charities in their cause area, and donate to those charities on a regular basis until the fund manager comes along and updates the allocation. This would prevent funds from sitting in limbo for long periods of time, and ideally would mirror what donors would otherwise be doing with the money if EA Funds didn&#x2019;t exist (i.e. in the absence of any other information, give to the top charities).<br><br>(Of course, this is moot if fund managers have a good reason to defer donating &#x2013; rather than simply not having the time to manage the fund.)<br><br>Additionally, the longer the fund holds on to donations, the more likely it is for the donor&apos;s intention and the fund&apos;s direction to diverge (I wrote more about this <a href=\"/ea/1k9/ea_funds_hands_out_money_very_infrequently_should/d8l\">here</a>). You could argue that this is already happening: when I donate to a fund, I do so in the expectation that the money will be handed out reasonably rapidly.</p>\n<p>---<br><br>[1] &#x2013; &quot;The size-weighted average discount rate [of EA orgs surveyed] for donations was 12%&quot;. https://80000hours.org/2017/11/talent-gaps-survey-2017/<br>[2] &#x2013; See US Treasury bond yields https://www.bloomberg.com/markets/rates-bonds/government-bonds/us.

Hopefully this will help the EA collective intelligence determine how much to prioritize blockchain. Specifically, I would like to make the claim\u2014\u201d</span><span>Positively shaping the development of blockchain/crypto</span><span>\u201d has high expected value and should be highly prioritized as a cause for effective altruists. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Note: I am relatively new to \u201cformal\u201d effective altruism and rationalist discourse, so please: a) Eviscerate my arguments b) Work with me on the \u201cprocess level\u201d to make better arguments going forwards. Thanks!</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>I will use the same prioritization framework that </span><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/problem-framework/\"><span>80,000 Hours</span></a><span> (and others) have used\u2014Neglectedness, Impact, Tractability (NIT). </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>One note before I begin: I\u2019m moderately incentivized to believe that this claim is true because I am an effective altruist, am working in blockchain, and would like my moral direction to be aligned with my professional direction. </span></p>\n<h1><span>Summary</span></h1>\n<p><span>Blockchain could be a crucial piece of a macro systemic phase shift that could solve coordination problems and prepare us for upcoming problems associated with increasingly large/fast technological change. However, this phase shift is incredibly unlikely and tricky to execute, so it could make more sense to concentrate on more clearly impactful/solvable problems.</span></p>\n<h1><span>Why work on this problem?</span></h1>\n<h2><span>Impact</span></h2>\n<p><span>There are a couple of different ways to look at the impact of positively shaping blockchain. </span></p>\n<h3><span>1. Effective Altruists Should Shape The Implementation of Any High-Impact New Technology</span></h3>\n<p><span>The argument here essentially is this:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Humans create new technology that has immense impacts on society.</span></li>\n<li><span>Profit-motivated incentive structures (not EA-/QALY-motivated structures) define how that technology is developed.</span></li>\n<li><span>The EA community should bring the EA perspective into any new technology with humanity-level scale.&nbsp;</span></li>\n<li><span>Blockchain is a high-impact technology, therefore EAs should be part of shaping it positively.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>I like to think about this from a counterfactual historical perspective: if EAs were more directly involved in shaping the industrial revolution, the internet, or AI, then we may be \u201cless far behind\u201d at solving the externalities of the profit-driven companies like climate change, attention design, and AI alignment. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>So, is blockchain going to have a large impact on society? It depends on how you measure this and who you ask :). I\u2019m not even sure what types of articles to add here. For now, let\u2019s still sticky this as \u201cup for debate\u201d.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Note that this point holds for any new technology, not just blockchain. e.g. As biotechnology enters society, we should have the EA mindset in the top companies, evaluating externalities/game theoretical problems, and baking solutions in from the start. </span></p>\n<h3><span>2. New \u201cOrganizational Technology\u201d for Coordination and Motivation </span></h3>\n<p><span>The high-level idea here is that blockchains are a new kind of \u201cOrganizational Technology\u201d that enables new kinds of </span><span>coordination</span><span> and </span><span>motivation</span><span>. I\u2019m using Albert Wenger\u2019s term Organizational Technology to discuss macro organizational structures like states, markets, firms, networks, (and now) blockchains. See the </span><a href=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*P_PqDI9gbK8OBs2yN49C0w.png\"><span>image here</span></a><span> (or </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LgQT874KHuw\"><span>his whole talk</span></a><span>).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>The argument here is very similar to the one above (just substituting \u201ctechnology\u201d for \u201cOrganizational Technology\u201d):</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Humans create new Organizational Technology that has immense impacts on society.</span></li>\n<li><span>Profit-motivated incentive structures (not EA-/QALY-motivated structures) define how that Organizational Technology is developed.</span></li>\n<li><span>The EA community should bring the EA perspective into any new Organizational Technology with humanity-level scale.</span></li>\n<li><span>Blockchain is a high-impact Organizational Technology, therefore EAs should be part of shaping it positively.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Again, we can think from a counterfactual perspective: if EAs were more directly involved in shaping nascent Organizational Technology like states, markets, firms, or networks, then we may be \u201cless far behind\u201d at solving the negative externalities of those Organizational Technologies like xenophobia or capitalism.</p>\n<p><span>As one example of Organizational Technology in action: the Organizational Technology of internet-enabled \u201cNetworks\u201d (namely zero transaction costs) enabled a new set of massive monopoly tech giants to form (Ben Thompson calls them </span><a href=\"https://stratechery.com/2017/defining-aggregators/\"><span>Aggregators</span></a><span>). However, one of the affordances of blockchain as an Organizational Technology is the ability to </span><a href=\"https://medium.com/@RhysLindmark/macro-blockchain-1-the-end-of-aggregation-theory-ad199a0c03d8\"><span>diminish the network effects of aggregators</span></a><span>, allowing for companies to compete where there was previously no leverage. </span></p>\n<p><span>It\u2019s also worth noting that \u201cblockchain as Organizational Technology\u201d is also part of a larger macro trend of </span><a href=\"http://www.iterationsofjason.com/2017/07/reinventing-organizations-by-frederic-laloux/\"><span>\u201cTeal\u201d</span></a><span> as an Organizational </span><span>Ideology</span><span>. The idea here is that companies have structured themselves differently over time. They used to be results-driven machines (Orange), then transitioned to culture-driven families (Green), and are now relationship-driven organisms (Teal). Teal organizations are a reaction to complex 21st century problems, and operate in a bottom-up decentralized fashion. Teal is the company-specific version of the macro trend where we\u2019re moving away from \u201cCores\u201d (that operate as traditional top-down institutions) and towards </span><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32191687-machine-platform-crowd---harnessing-our-digital-future\"><span>\u201cCrowds\u201d</span></a><span> (that build and leverage the 4B networked community of smartphone users). </span><a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/grants/\"><span>EA Grants</span></a><span> are a great example of the EA community using this trend (crowd-sourcing applicants for funding). </span></p>\n<p><span>Note that this point (blockchain as Organizational Technology) strengthens the point above (that blockchain is an impactful technology). If a new technology is also an Organizational Technology, it is likely to be more impactful.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Again, note that this point holds for any new Organizational Technology, not just blockchain. e.g. As a new one enters society, we should have the EA mindset shape it by evaluating externalities/game theoretical problems, and baking solutions in from the start. (Though it\u2019s worth noting that new Organizational Technology doesn\u2019t come along often. From Albert\u2019s perspective, there are only 5.)</span></p>\n<h3><span>3. The Opportunity to Direct A Massive Redistribution of Wealth</span></h3>\n<p><span>The high-level idea here is that the appreciation of cryptocurrencies redistribute/create substantial amounts of wealth. Though it\u2019s possible to look at this wealth from a macro perspective (by looking at the </span><a href=\"https://coinmarketcap.com/charts/\"><span>total market cap of cryptocurrencies around $300B</span></a><span>), I find it much more powerful to look at individual cases. At the end of 2017, </span><a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2018/01/10/fundraising-success/\"><span>MIRI raised $2.5M, 66% of which was from crypto</span></a><span> (and Vitalik!). There\u2019s a wealthy Bitcoin investor who is donating $86M to charity, and they gave </span><a href=\"https://pineapplefund.org/\"><span>$5M to GiveDirectly at the end of 2017</span></a><span>. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>It\u2019s difficult to say exactly how much money is \u201cat stake\u201d here, but we can look at this in a similar way as something like the Founders Pledge. i.e. Startup founders can make lots of money from an exit, so let\u2019s get them to donate that money to effective charities. Founders Pledge has $412M USD pledged across 1123 individuals. Though the Pineapple Fund is clearly an outlier, that person gave $86M USD (with Bitcoin at $16,500) across a single individual. It would likely be a high leverage opportunity to get even .1% of the blockchain community to take some sort of CryptoPledge to give their new wealth to charity.</span></p>\n<h3><span>4. Through Organizational Technology, Wealth Redistribution, and Disintermediation, Crypto Will Create Large Creative Destruction Externalities</span></h3>\n<p><span>This claim is a bit more nuanced (and generally less likely but higher expected value). It\u2019s broken into two parts. The first is that blockchain-based disintermediation will create lots of white-collar job loss, which will lead to political unrest. It\u2019s a very similar argument to AI-based automation leading to (primarily) blue-collar job loss. This idea (where a new technology restructures society) is called a \u201c</span><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creative_destruction\"><span>Creative Destruction Externality</span></a><span>\u201d (see </span><a href=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*K7toz2wON5WoOSQUkoEx9w.gif\"><span>this explanatory gif</span></a><span>). Like with AI, it\u2019s difficult to know exactly how much the workforce will shift as a result of blockchain-based disintermediation (though many large centralized institutions, like banks, may be at risk).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>The second claim is at a more macro level. If #1 (blockchain is a powerful new Technology), #2 (blockchain is a new Organization Technology), and #3 (crypto redistributes wealth) are true, then we will likely see a large power shift in how society is structured. Large, quick transitions of power (especially at the nation-state level) create unstable conditions </span><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2015/09/united-states-china-war-thucydides-trap/406756/\"><span>more likely to lead to war</span></a><span>. If a transition happens away from nation-states (and other traditionally trusted centralized institutions like banks and academia), we\u2019d love to make it as smooth as possible.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>On the Organizational Technology side: just as massive networks like Facebook and Google shifted power away from existing Organizational Technology (like nation-states), we could see blockchain-enabled protocols shifting power away from networks, nation-states, etc. (In fact, this is a much more intentional goal of blockchain and crypto. They\u2019re actively trying to take away power from nation-states, by, for example, giving non-nation-state actors the ability to create currency.) In parallel with the new macro power shift around Organizational Technology, we also might see a shift at the individual wealth level (which is highly correlated with power). Though this is less studied (as far as I know), I would expect some sort of instability as a result of changes in individual power dynamics.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Traditionally, EAs haven\u2019t up-prioritized the \u201cfragility from job loss\u201d aspects of AI (because we\u2019re more worried about AI alignment and the long-term future). However, the claim here is that this blockchain-influenced power shift is on a different order of magnitude (because we\u2019re changing deeper primitives like money).</span></p>\n<h3><span>5. Blockchain Helps us Solve The \u201cGame Theory\u201d Meta-Problem</span></h3>\n<p><span>This final argument is specific to blockchain. I think it could be the most powerful argument, though it\u2019s the trickiest, and the one I\u2019m least confident about. Here\u2019s the idea:</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Solving Generative Functions Rather Than Specific Problems</span></p>\n<p><span>When we look at a prioritized cause selection list (e.g. </span><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/cause-selection/\"><span>80,000 Hours</span></a><span>\u2019 list), we can bucket the problems into the \u201cgenerative function\u201d that causes them (you can also think of this as the \u201croot cause\u201d). When we apply this \u201cbucketed generative function\u201d to 80,000 Hours\u2019 cause selection, we get the following buckets: Game Theory Problems, Meta Problems, and Empathy Problems (see the image below).</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995664/mirroredImages/f4rH64WrjN3gda96L/mfrqpy9qanuuckdy0el6.png\"></span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Each of these take the form: \u201cif you could solve the generative function, then the problems in that bucket get solved\u201d. For example: If we \u201csolved\u201d the </span><span>Empathy Problem</span><span> by having perfect \u201cabstract empathy\u201d, then we would not have problems like Factory Farming (where tens of billions of animals suffer every year because we do not empathize with them enough) or Developing World Health/Smoking in the Developing World (where billions of humans suffer every year because the developed world doesn\u2019t empathize with them enough).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Now let\u2019s look at the Game Theory bucket. These are coordination problems that arise from game theoretic incentive structures. Risks from AI, Biosecurity, and Nuclear Security are all \u201cArms Races\u201d and Climate Change is a \u201cTragedy of the Commons\u201d. If we were able to solve all Game Theory problems (e.g. the 14 from </span><a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/\"><span>Meditations on Moloch</span></a><span> or </span><a href=\"https://twitter.com/BretWeinstein/status/961503023854833665\"><span>these 7</span></a><span> from Bret Weinstein), then that would solve all of the sub-problems. So, instead of solving one x-risk and losing to the rest, let\u2019s solve them all! Another way to think about this (especially from a long-term future perspective) is that solving game theory will allow us to solve all of the x-risk problems we don\u2019t even know of yet (but will come increasingly quickly as we have massive distributed exponential technological change).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>This uses relatively similar language to the most recently up-prioritized 80,000 Hours\u2019 cause: </span><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/improving-institutional-decision-making/\"><span>Institutional Decision Making</span></a><span>. There are two especially relevant quotes from that article. The 1st is on distributed exponential technological change and the 2nd is on moving to the meta-level to solve problems:</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>On distributed exponential technological change:</span> <span>We think that improving the decision-making competence of key institutions may be particularly crucial, as the </span><span>risks we face as a society are rapidly growing</span><span>. With technological developments in nuclear weapons, autonomous weapons, bioengineering, and artificial intelligence, our </span><span>destructive power is quickly increasing</span><span>. Crises resulting from war, malicious actors, or even accidents could claim billions of lives or more.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>On moving to the meta-level:</span> <span>When we think about doing good in the world we usually think about solving specific problems, and doing so better than existing institutions and organisations. But you could also improve the world in a different way: by making it easier...to solve problems...One advantage of this approach is that, if successful, it could </span><span>enable humanity to better tackle many different problems \u2013 including those we haven\u2019t even noticed yet.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Why Blockchain Can Solve Game Theory</span></p>\n<p><span>The above section makes the argument to solve meta problems (especially in the face of exponential change). But, I haven\u2019t yet made the claim for why blockchain can </span><span>actually solve</span><span> any of those meta problems. Now, I\u2019ll concentrate specifically on blockchain\u2019s ability to solve Game Theory Problems. (Yes, this is an </span><span>aggressive</span><span> claim.)</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>We can generally think of this as \u201csolving coordination problems\u201d. Though there are many aspects to solving coordination problems, we can primarily bucket them into: decreasing the </span><span>costs</span><span> to coordinate and increasing the </span><span>desire</span><span> to coordinate. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Blockchain Decreases the External Costs to Coordinate</span></p>\n<p><span>There are a couple different reasons why blockchain decreases the cost to coordinate. First, at an abstract level, </span><span>smart contracts allow for strong precommitments in the absence of trust.</span><span> Essentially, this allows rational actors to commit to coordinate if (and only if) the other party coordinates. (e.g. Pay and distribute funds only when n actors have also done so. Like a Kickstarter threshold.) And, smart contracts (generally) do not allow parties to back out of the agreement\u2014it will fire no matter what. This means that once \u201ccooperate\u201d is locked in (e.g. with a climate agreement), you cannot decide to defect later.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Second, </span><span>tokens democratize incentive design</span><span>, allowing for alignment across a given range of stakeholders (where previously the transactions costs were too high to do so). This idea exists at the intersection of a couple of others: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><span><span><a href=\"http://platform.coop/\">Platform cooperativism</a> (and protocol cooperativism), which takes the traditional coop model (of distributed governance and ownership) and applies it to new technology platforms/protocols (e.g. Uber that is owned and governed by the drivers and riders).</span></span></span></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.bigchaindb.com/tokenize-the-enterprise-23d51bafb536\"><span>Tokenize the Enterprise</span></a><span>, which takes a traditional tech company (like Facebook) then distributes governance and ownership among platform stakeholders, which (in theory) increases long-term profits because of incentive alignment.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>By decreasing the cost of distributing ownership/governance, we can now rewire the incentive structures to be more in-line with all stakeholders. When we apply this to massive tech platforms, we begin to turn them into public utilities.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Third, tokens decrease the costs to support public goods through a micro economy feedback loop. The feedback loop looks like this: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>If I hold some crypto (let\u2019s say ETH),&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Then spend some of that ETH to support a public good/infrastructure (like an open-source tool),&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Then that public infrastructure gets built,&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Then the demand to use the network increases (because the public infrastructure has made it better in some way),&nbsp;</li>\n<li>Then the price of the remaining ETH that you hold increases.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>What this means is that rational actors are actually financially incentivized to support public works (diminishing Tragedy of the Commons). Two quick caveats: First, this is not </span><span>technically</span><span> different than how it works with nation-state fiat. I could hold USD, fund an awesome new public transport system in the US, then the value of my USD could increase as a result of demand to live in the US, etc. However, crypto allows us to do this at a micro scale (and </span><span>quantity</span><span> has a </span><span>quality</span><span> in and of itself). Second, this does not actually \u201cbreak\u201d Tragedy of the Commons. A rational actor would still be incentivized to let someone </span><span>else</span><span> fund the commons, hold their ETH, and then reap the rewards once the infrastructure has been built. However, the financial incentives (from a micro economy) do \u201c</span><span>diminish</span><span>\u201d the tragedy of the commons. </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Blockchain Increases the Internal Desire To Coordinate</span></p>\n<p><span>Even if some of the claims above are true, it is not necessarily the case that people </span><span>will</span><span> coordinate. i.e. The costs may be lower than before, but they just won\u2019t want to. This is why it\u2019s crucial to also increase the \u201cinternal desire\u201d to coordinate. This desire/mindset/ideology is the result of the context and the stories we tell given that context. Whenever you\u2019re trying to \u201cexit\u201d a system, you need to create a self-sustaining this through </span><span>both</span><span> stories and infrastructure. (Or, in Marxist terms: as </span><a href=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*WdKaL8wsokjg-Muugih2Tw.png\"><span>base </span><span>and</span><span> superstructure</span></a><span>.)</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>The desire to coordinate is based on our 2018 context. We both: a) Have begun to reach abundance (you don\u2019t get happier after $4,000/month!) and b) Are about to experience massive converging exponential technological change (as a result of 4B smartphones decreasing the costs to create value). This context both </span><span>allows</span><span> us to think about abundant shared outcomes (we don\u2019t need to compete to get more) and </span><span>requires</span><span> us to (because we need to not doing so results in increasing amounts of high-downside coordination problems).</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Given that context, we can begin to tell stories about a future in which the traditional economically \u201crational man\u201d does </span><span>not</span><span> dominate. Instead, we can push a \u201csuper rational\u201d future in which we have abundance mindsets and actively co-evolve towards shared outcomes. If cooperation is encouraged (or expected), then more people will cooperate.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Blockchain is an especially good place to start incubating this mindset because it:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Lowers the costs of coordination (given the points above).</li>\n<li>Is a community of people who are hyper aware of incentives.</li>\n<li>Is closely related to the open-source community, which already has a mindset of common goods, interoperability, collaboration, and distributed governance/ownership.</li>\n<li>Is the largest distributed group of people who feel \u201cabundance\u201d (through the rise of crypto prices). They have enough money and have moved up Maslow\u2019s hierarchy of needs to start working for the \u201cgreater good\u201d.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Given that context, the blockchain ecosystem is a place where we can begin testing ideas that are only possible because of abundance. Coordination ideology (like saying \u201clet\u2019s co-evolve towards shared outcomes!\u201d) wouldn\u2019t have convinced anyone in a </span><span>developing country</span><span> in 1968 (because of various scarcity mindsets). However, this kind of ideology may actually (and has been) taking hold in blockchain networks in 2018.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Examples</span></p>\n<p><span>Now that we\u2019ve touched on both parts of the reinforcing loop above (that blockchain decreases the technical costs to coordination and is a fertile incubation ground to increase the desire to coordinate), we can look at some proto examples of this in action. (We\u2019ll just scope to the Ethereum ecosystem.)</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>First off, there are a couple examples of an active \u201cself-tax for infrastructure\u201d mindset. They are:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://ecf.network/\"><span>Ethereum Community Fund</span></a><span>: 6 ETH projects (OmiseGO, Golem, Raiden, Cosmos, Maker, Global Brain) are all giving to support a $100M fund to support Ethereum infrastructure</span></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://ethprize.io/\"><span>ETHPrize</span></a><span>: Two ~$250,000 infrastructure grants sponsored by 4 ETH projects (0x, Status, Toshi, ECF).</span></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://media.consensys.net/get-to-know-the-47-projects-that-make-up-the-consensys-mesh-478b7d3028c1\"><span>ConsenSys</span></a><span>: A ETH-focused company that supports like of underlying infrastructure (Infura, Metamask, Truffle, uPort, etc.)</span></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://engineering.coinbase.com/coinbase-open-source-fund-ruby-edition-101c04085be0\"><span>Coinbase</span></a><span>: Gives $25,000 to open-source software each month</span></li>\n<li>(This is all in addition to the work that the Ethereum Foundation is doing, <a href=\"https://blog.ethereum.org/2018/03/07/announcing-beneficiaries-ethereum-foundation-grants/\"><span>like these grants</span></a><span>.)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Second, we can see some examples of the mindset: \u201copen-source interoperable collaboration directed at SharedGoals\u201d:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Many \u201ctraditionally competing\u201d projects working in parallel towards SharedOutcomes: Cross-project <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_Z8F6FUJxU\"><span>Plasma implementation</span></a><span> calls, </span><a href=\"https://medium.com/@web3/scalingnow-scaling-solution-summit-summary-be30047047bf\"><span>ScalingNow! event</span></a><span> focused on cross-project scaling, a cross-project </span><a href=\"https://medium.com/@web3/decentralized-exchanges-workshop-outcomes-4753dbd86f2b\"><span>decentralized exchange workshop</span></a><span>, cross-project ETHCommons calls on things like </span><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mxt-SdfXEKw\"><span>cryptoeconomic primitives</span></a></li>\n<li>An example <a href=\"https://blog.aragon.one/the-emergent-ethereum-stack-cbce1895142f\"><span>stack</span></a><span> of Ethereum, Aragon, district0x, and Decentraland (though these projects aren\u2019t direct competitors, they are emphasizing the SharedOutcome).</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>To conclude, we\u2019ve looked at a variety of reasons why \u201cpositively shaping crypto\u201d might have a large impact on society: </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>EAs should shape the implementation of any high-impact <span>technology</span></li>\n<li>EAs should shape the implementation of any high-impact <span>organizational technology</span></li>\n<li>There are a bunch of rich people in crypto</li>\n<li>Crypto may create new systems, resulting in large creative destruction externalities</li>\n<li>Blockchain might help us solve game theory. (Lol.)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span>Neglectedness</span></h2>\n<p><span>In general, very few people are working directly on the intersection of blockchain + effective altruism. However, there are various EAs </span><span>working</span> <span>in</span><span> crypto (</span><a href=\"https://www.trusttoken.com/\"><span>TrustToken</span></a><span>, Flamingo, </span><a href=\"https://www.evermarkets.com/\"><span>Evermarkets</span></a><span>, </span><a href=\"https://www.flare-global.com/\"><span>FlareGlobal</span></a><span>) There are a good amount of EAs who are </span><span>interested in</span><span> crypto (about </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/148305269094790/\"><span>400 in this Facebook group</span></a><span>). There is also a bunch of overlap at the high level (Vitalik Buterin, Wei Dai, Gwern...see SSC\u2019s </span><a href=\"https://www.lesserwrong.com/posts/MajyZJrsf8fAywWgY/a-lesswrong-crypto-autopsy\"><span>A LessWrong Crypto Autopsy</span></a><span>). </span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>One issue with determining Neglectedness: It\u2019s not really clear what \u201cproblem\u201d I\u2019m referencing here. For crypto whales donating to charity, there may not be as much neglectedness (see the Pineapple Fund or Vitalik\u2019s donations). But for something like the Creative Destruction Externalities of a macro power shift, there\u2019s almost certainly more neglectedness.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Tractability</span></h3>\n<p><span>Again, we have issues in differentiating what problem we\u2019re actually referencing. Virally spreading a CryptoPledge to get more funds directed at EA causes is likely a more tractable problem that catalyzing a macro phase shift that solves the generative function of our coordination problems.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>The other issue with looking at tractability is we have very little data here (because it\u2019s mostly neglected). We haven\u2019t been able to see whether progress is easy, because we (generally) haven\u2019t tried.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>One final note (which I think goes in this bucket?): From my personal experience, the crypto world (and especially the </span><a href=\"https://www.smithandcrown.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Smart-Contract-comparison-chart-01-01-01.jpg\"><span>smart contract platform</span></a><span> ecosystem like Ethereum/Tezos) has a bunch of people who are ripe for EA-style ideas. This is likely a good thing for tractability but perhaps a counter-argument against many of these points: if the crypto world would be interested in EA ideas, why haven\u2019t they already done it? Or, perhaps they are ready enough for it that it\u2019s not worth our effort? (i.e. It\u2019s inevitable.)</span></p>\n<h1><span>What are the major arguments against this problem being pressing?</span></h1>\n<p><span>You could go through each of the buckets above and argue against various points. i.e. Blockchain is not actually going to have a large impact, it\u2019s not actually that neglected because there\u2019s so much nerd overlap, and it\u2019s not actually that tractable because we\u2019re dealing with complex macro systems. I think all of those are reasonable. Here are some additional reasons to down-prioritize this cause. If...</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Smart contract platforms continue to have serious scaling issues (none of the ETH scaling solutions work as planned, and new platforms like Tezos/Dfinity stay in testing).</li>\n<li>Trust in centralized institutions (<a href=\"http://www.people-press.org/2017/05/03/public-trust-in-government-1958-2017/\"><span>nation-states</span></a><span>, </span><a href=\"http://news.gallup.com/poll/212840/americans-confidence-institutions-edges.aspx\"><span>banks</span></a><span>, academic institutions) increases enough to make \u201cexit\u201d less needed/desirable.</span></li>\n<li>Governments around the world coordinate to crack down on crypto.</li>\n<li>Initial tests in the path towards macro systems change fail.</li>\n<li>The \u201cCost of Delay\u201d for a different cause increases dramatically.&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Random Notes:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>From a \u201cpositively shaping AI\u201d perspective, it\u2019s likely some attention should be given to AI + blockchain projects like <a href=\"https://oceanprotocol.com\"><span>Ocean</span></a><span> (a data substrate layer), </span><a href=\"https://singularitynet.io\"><span>SingularityNET</span></a><span> (decentralized AI compute), and </span><a href=\"https://numer.ai/\"><span>Numerai</span></a><span> (AI hedge fund). </span></li>\n<li>A reminder that the base rates are low for new Organizational Technology and high-impact technology. (i.e. It\u2019s more likely that not that a random new technology isn\u2019t actually that important.)</li>\n<li>There are some intuitive thoughts that haven\u2019t been fleshed out here, like: what are the emergent properties of programmable money (especially given a status quo of 250 years of traditional nation-state fiat)? And what are the emergent properties of adding a value creation layer/protocol to the internet, thereby democratizing the ability to rewire incentive structures?</li>\n<li>This argument definitely exists in the realm of complex dynamic systems, which has not (traditionally) been placed under the EA umbrella. In many ways, I\u2019m actually making the claim \u201cwe should focus on macro systemic change\u201d, <span>not</span><span> the claim \u201clet\u2019s positively shape the development of crypto\u201d (crypto is just \u201chow\u201d we do the system change \u201cwhat\u201d).</span></li>\n<li>There is a bit of strange reasoning here, where I\u2019m not just looking at reality from a purely objective perspective. Instead, I\u2019m saying something like: <span>\u201cwouldn\u2019t it be cool if crypto helped us solve coordination problems? Well we can kind of nudge it so that it might be able to. There\u2019s high expected value, but only if we distort reality to make it so.\u201d</span></li>\n<li>If you\u2019re reading this and think \u201cwoof, Rhys really is down the crypto rabbit hole and is a crazy crypto maximalist\u201d, I think that\u2019s a relatively reasonable response. (And my counter would be <span>\u201cwouldn\u2019t you be a maximalist about something that could help us phase shift to beat coordination problems?\u201d</span><span>)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thanks again for reading!

This overview focuses on beliefs about population ethics and exchange rates between <em>goods</em> (e.g. happiness) and <em>bads</em> (e.g. suffering). Two variables seem particularly important and action-guiding in this context, especially when trying to make informed choices about how to best shape the long-term future: 1) One\u2019s <em>normative goods-to-bads ratio</em> (N-ratio) and 2) one\u2019s <em>expected bads-to-goods ratio</em> (E-ratio). I elaborate on\u00a0how a framework consisting of these two variables could inform our decision-making with respect to shaping the long-term future, as well as facilitate cooperation among differing value systems and further moral reflection. I then present concrete ideas for further research in this area and investigate associated challenges. The last section lists resources which discuss further methodological and theoretical issues which were beyond the scope of the present text.</p>\n<h1>Descriptive ethics and long-term future prioritization</h1>\n<p>Recently, some debate has emerged on whether reducing extinction risk is the ideal course of action for shaping the long-term future. For instance, in the <a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/gpi-research-agenda.pdf\">Global Priorities Institute (GPI) research agenda</a>, Greaves &amp; MacAskill (2017, p.13) ask \u201c[...] whether it might be more important to ensure that future civilisation is good, assuming we don\u2019t go extinct, than to ensure that future civilisation happens at all.\u201d We could further ask to what extent we should focus our efforts on reducing\u00a0<a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/reducing-risks-of-astronomical-suffering-a-neglected-priority/\">risks of astronomical suffering</a> (s-risks). Again, Greaves &amp; MacAskill: \u201cShould we be more concerned about avoiding the worst possible outcomes for the future than we are for ensuring the very best outcomes occur [...]?\u201d Given the enormous stakes, these are arguably some of the most important questions facing those who prioritize shaping the long-term future.<a href=\"#footnote\"><sup>1</sup></a></p>\n<p>Some interventions increase both the quality of future civilization as well as its probability. <a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/international-cooperation-vs-ai-arms-race/\">Promoting international cooperation</a>, for instance, likely reduces extinction risks as well as s-risks. However, it seems implausible for one single intervention to be <em>optimally</em> cost-effective at accomplishing both types of objectives at the same time. To the extent to which there is a tradeoff between different goals relating to shaping the long-term future, we\u00a0should make a well-considered choice about how to prioritize among them.</p>\n<h2>Normative and expected ratios (aka exchange rates and future optimism)</h2>\n<p>I suggest that this choice can be informed by two important variables: One\u2019s <em>normative bads-to-goods ratio</em><a href=\"#footnote\"><sup>2</sup></a> (<strong>N-ratio</strong>) and one\u2019s empirically<em> expected goods-to-bads ratio</em> (<strong>E-ratio</strong>). Taken together, these variables can serve as a framework for choosing between different options to shape the long-term future.</p>\n<p>(For utilitarians, N- and E-ratios amount to their normative / expected suffering-to-happiness ratios. But for most humans, there are bads besides suffering, e.g. injustice, and goods other than happiness, e.g. love, knowledge, or art. More on this below.)</p>\n<p>I will elaborate in greater detail below on how to best interpret and measure these two ratios. For now, a few examples should suffice to illustrate the general concept. Someone with a high N-ratio of, say, 100:1 believes that reducing bads is one hundred times as important as increasing goods, whereas someone with an N-ratio of 1:1 thinks that increasing goods and reducing bads is of equal importance.<a href=\"#footnote\"><sup>3</sup></a> Similarly, someone with an E-ratio of, say, 1000:1 thinks that there will be one thousand times as much good than bad in the future in expectation, whereas someone with a lower E-ratio is more pessimistic about the future.<a href=\"#footnote\"><sup>4</sup></a></p>\n<p>Note that I don\u2019t assume an objective way to measure goods and bads, so a statement like \u201creducing suffering is <em>x</em> times more important than promoting happiness\u201d is imprecise unless one further specifies what precisely is being compared. (See also the section \"<a href=\"#measurability\">The measurability of happiness and suffering</a>\".)</p>\n<p>In short, the more one's E-ratio exceeds one's N-ratio, the higher one\u2019s expected value of the future, and the more one favors interventions that primarily reduce extinction risks.<a href=\"#footnote\"><sup>5</sup></a> In contrast, the more one's N-ratio exceeds one's E-ratio, the more appealing become interventions that primarily reduce s-risks or otherwise improve the quality of the future without affecting its probability. The graphic below summarizes the discussion so far.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://foundational-research.org/files/N_E_ratio_priorities_transparent.png\" /></p>\n<p>Of course, this reasoning is rather simplistic. In practice, considerations from comparative advantages, tractability, neglectedness, option value, moral trade, et cetera need to be factored in.<a href=\"#footnote\"><sup>6</sup></a> See also <a href=\"/ea/1k4/cause_prioritization_for_downsidefocused_value/\"><em>Cause prioritization for downside-focused value systems</em></a> for a more in-depth analysis.<a href=\"#footnote\"><sup>7</sup></a></p>\n<h3>Interpreting and measuring N-ratios</h3>\n<p>The rest of this section elaborates on the meaning of N-ratios and explains one approach of measuring or at least approximating them. In short, I propose to approximate an individual\u2019s N-ratio by measuring their response tendencies\u00a0to various ethical thought experiments (e.g. as part of a questionnaire or survey) and comparing them to those of other individuals. These questions could be of (roughly) the following kind:</p>\n<p>Imagine you could create a new world inhabited by X humans living in a utopian civilization free of involuntary suffering, and where everyone is extremely kind, intelligent, and compassionate. In this world, however, there also exist 100 humans who experience extreme suffering.\u00a0</p>\n<p>What\u2019s the smallest value of X for which you would want to create this world?</p>\n<p>In short, people who respond with higher equivalence numbers X to such thought experiments should have higher N-ratios, on average.</p>\n<p>Some words of caution are in order here. First, the final formulations of such questions should obviously contain more detailed information and, for example, specify how the inhabitants of the utopian society live, what form of suffering the humans experience precisely, et cetera. (See also the document \u201c<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hXMYQlFxkXYXwN9Oxa2bgZ2Y4mv9cA3RFl9h2QKGcZI/edit?usp=sharing\">Preliminary Formulations of Ethical Thought Experiments</a>\u201d which contains much longer formulations.)</p>\n<p>Second, an individual\u2019s equivalence number X will depend on what form of ethical dilemma is used and its precise wording. For example, asking people to make <strong>intra</strong>personal instead of <strong>inter</strong>personal trade-offs, or writing \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Person-affecting_view\">preserving</a>\u201d instead of \u201ccreating\u201d, will likely influence the responses.</p>\n<p>Third, subjects\u2019 equivalence numbers will depend on which <em>type</em> of bad or good is depicted. Hedonistic utilitarians, for instance, regard pleasure as the single most important good and would place great value on, say, computer programs experiencing extremely blissful states. Many other value systems would consider such programs to be of no positive value whatsoever. Fortunately, many if not most value systems regard suffering<a href=\"#footnote\"><sup>8</sup></a> as one of the most important bads and also place substantial positive value on flourishing societies inhabited by humans experiencing eudaimonia \u2013\u00a0i.e. \u201chuman flourishing\u201d or happiness plus various other goods, such as virtue and friendship.<a href=\"#footnote\"><sup>9</sup></a> In conclusion, although N-ratios (as well as E-ratios) are generally <em>agent-relative</em>, well-chosen \u201csuffering-to-eudaimonia ratios\u201d will likely allow for more meaningful and robust interindividual comparisons while still being sufficiently natural and informative. (See also the section \"<a href=\"#agent-relativity\">N-ratios and E-ratios are agent-relative</a>\" of the appendix for a further discussion of this issue.)</p>\n<p>However, <em>even</em> if we limit our discussion to various forms of suffering and eudaimonia, judgments might diverge substantially. For example, Anna might only be willing to trade one minute of physical torture in exchange for many years of eudaimonia, while she would trade one week of depression for just one hour of eudaimonia. Others might make different or even opposite choices. If we had asked Anna only the first question, we could have concluded that her N-ratio is high, but her stance on the second question suggests that the picture is more complicated.</p>\n<p>Consequently, one might say that even different forms of suffering and happiness/eudaimonia comprise \u201caxiologically distinct\u201d categories and that, instead of generic \u201csuffering-to-eudaimonia ratios\u201d \u2013 let alone \u201cbads-to-goods ratios\u201d \u2013 we need more fine-grained ratios, e.g. \u201csuffering_typeY-to-eudaimonia_typeZ ratios\u201d.<a href=\"#footnote\"><sup>10</sup></a></p>\n<p>See also \u201c<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_QVHQrgIFtnVIldL9-SdBT4vSEi26OQzB1Gr749Nrk4/edit?usp=sharing\">Towards a Systematic Framework for Descriptive (Population) Ethics</a>\u201d for a more extensive overview of the relevant dimensions along which ethical thought experiments can and should vary. \u201c<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1COlUvsQa1wFxY7HOt12pK1YI-LgdnvsUJK8bdOg4dAg/edit?usp=sharing\">Descriptive Ethics \u2013 Methodology and Literature Review</a>\u201d provides an in-depth discussion of various methodological and theoretical questions, such as how to prevent anchoring or framing effects, control for scope insensitivity, increase internal consistency, and so on.</p>\n<h1>The need for a survey (of effective altruists)</h1>\n<p>Do these considerations suggest that research in descriptive ethics is simply not feasible? This seems unlikely to me but it\u2019s at least worth investigating further.</p>\n<p>For illustration, imagine that a few hundred effective altruists completed a survey consisting of thirty different ethical thought experiments that vary along a certain number of dimensions, such as the form and intensity of suffering or happiness, its duration, or the number of beings involved.</p>\n<p>We could now assign a percentile rank to every participant for each ethical thought experiment. If the concept of a general N-ratio is viable, we should observe that the percentile ranks of a given participant correlate across different dilemmas. That is, if someone gave very high equivalence numbers to the first, say, fifteen dilemmas, it should be more likely that this person also gave high equivalence numbers to the remaining dilemmas. Investigating whether there is such a correlation, how high it is, and how much it depends on the type or wording of each ethical thought experiment, could itself lead to interesting insights.</p>\n<h2>What could we learn from such a survey?</h2>\n<p>Important and action-guiding conclusions could be inferred from such a survey, both on an individual and on a group level.</p>\n<p>First, consider the individual level. Imagine a participant answered with \u201cinfinite\u201d in twenty dilemmas. Further assume that the average equivalence number of this participant in the remaining ten dilemmas was also extremely high, say, one billion. Unless this person has an unreasonably high E-ratio, this person should, ceteris paribus, prioritize interventions that reduce s-risks over, say, interventions that primarily reduce risks of extinction but which might also increase s-risks; especially so if they learn that most respondents with lower average equivalence numbers do the same.<a href=\"#footnote\"><sup>12</sup></a></p>\n<p>Second, let\u2019s turn to the group level. It could be very useful to know how equivalence numbers among effective altruists are distributed. For example, central tendencies such as the median or average equivalence number could inform allocation decisions within the effective altruism movement as a whole. They could also serve as a starting point for finding compromise solutions or moral trades between varying groups within the EA movement \u2013\u00a0e.g. between groups with more upside-focused value systems and those with more downside-focused value systems. Lastly, engaging with the actual thought experiments of the survey, as well as its results and potential implications, could increase the moral reflection and sophistication of the participants,\u00a0allowing them to make decisions more in line with their idealized preferences.</p>\n<h3>Descriptive ethics and its importance for multiverse-wide superrationality</h3>\n<p><em>Readers unfamiliar with the idea of multiverse-wide superrationality (MSR) are strongly encouraged to first read the paper \u201c</em><a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/files/Multiverse-wide-Cooperation-via-Correlated-Decision-Making.pdf\"><em>Multiverse-wide Cooperation via Correlated Decision Making</em></a><em>\u201d (Oesterheld, 2017) or the post \u201c</em><a href=\"/ea/1gf/multiversewide_cooperation_in_a_nutshell/\"><em>Multiverse-wide cooperation in a nutshell</em></a><em>\u201d. Readers unconvinced by or uninterested in MSR are welcome to skip this section.</em></p>\n<p>To briefly summarize, MSR is the idea that by taking into account the values of <a href=\"https://www.gwern.net/docs/xrisks/1985-hofstadter\">superrationalists</a> located elsewhere in the multiverse, it becomes more likely that they do the same for us. In order for MSR to work, it is essential to have at least some knowledge about how the values of superrationalists elsewhere in the multiverse are distributed. Surveying the values of (superrational) humans<a href=\"#footnote\"><sup>13</sup></a> is one promising way of gaining such knowledge.<a href=\"#footnote\"><sup>14</sup></a></p>\n<p>Obtaining a better estimate of the average N-ratio of superrationalists in the multiverse seems especially action-guiding. For illustration, imagine we knew that most superrationalists in the multiverse have a very high N-ratio. All else equal and ignoring considerations from neglectedness, tractability, etc., this implies that superrationalists elsewhere in the multiverse would probably want us to prioritize the reduction of s-risks over the reduction of extinction risks.<a href=\"#footnote\"><sup>15</sup></a> In contrast, if we knew that the average N-ratio among superrationalists in the multiverse is very low, reducing extinction risks would become more promising.</p>\n<p>Another important question is to what extent and in what respects superrationalists discriminate between their native species and the species located elsewhere in the multiverse.<a href=\"#footnote\"><sup>16</sup></a></p>\n<h2>The problem of biased, unreliable, and unstable judgments</h2>\n<p>Another challenge facing research in descriptive ethics is that at least some answers are likely to be driven by more or less superficial <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual_process_theory_(moral_psychology)\">system 1 heuristics</a> generating a variety of biases \u2013\u00a0e.g. empathy gap, duration neglect, scope insensitivity, and framing effects, to name just a few. While there are ways to facilitate the engagement of more controlled cognitive processes<a href=\"#footnote\"><sup>17</sup></a> that make reflective judgments more likely, not every possible bias or confounder can be eliminated.</p>\n<p>All in all, the skeptic has a point when she distrusts the results of such surveys because she assumes that most subjects merely pulled their equivalence numbers out of thin air. Ultimately, however, I think that reflecting on various ethical thought experiments in a systematic fashion, pulling equivalence numbers out of thin air and then using these numbers to make more informed decisions about how to best shape the long-term future is often better \u2013\u00a0in the sense of dragging in fewer biases and distorting intuitions \u2013 than pulling one\u2019s entire decision out of thin air.<a href=\"#footnote\"><sup>18</sup></a></p>\n<p>A further problem is that the N-ratios of many subjects will likely fluctuate over the course of years or even weeks.<a href=\"#footnote\"><sup>19</sup></a> Nonetheless, knowing one\u2019s N-ratios will be informative and potentially action-guiding for some subjects \u2013\u00a0e.g. for those who already engaged in substantial amounts of moral reflection (and are thus likely to have more stable N-ratios), or for subjects who have particularly high N-ratios such that their priorities would only shift if their N-ratios changed dramatically. Studying the stability of N-ratios is also an interesting research project in itself.

Consequently, if we want to avoid confusion, E-ratios and N-ratios should ultimately refer to the values of a specific agent, or, to be more precise, a specific set of goods and bads.</p>\n<p>For illustration, consider two hypothetical agents: Agent_1 has an N-ratio of 1:1 and an E-ratio of 1000:1, while agent_2 has an N-ratio of 1:1 and an E-ratio of 1:10. Do these agents share similar values but have radically different conceptions about how the future will likely unfold? Not necessarily. Agent_1 might be a total hedonistic utilitarian and agent_2 an AI that wants to maximize paperclips and minimize spam emails. Both might agree that the future will, in expectation, contain 1000 times as much pleasure as suffering but 10 times as many spam emails as paperclips.</p>\n<p>Of course, the sets of bads and goods of <em>humans</em> will often overlap, at least to some extent. Consequently, if we learn that human_1 has a much lower E-ratio than human_2, this tells us that human_1 is probably more pessimistic than human_2 and that both likely disagree about how the future is going to unfold.</p>\n<p>In this context, it also seems worth noting that there might be more overlap with regards to bads than with regards to goods. For illustration, consider the number of macroscopically distinct futures whose net value is extremely negative according to at least 99.5% of all humans. It seems plausible that this number is (much) greater than the number of macroscopically distinct futures whose net value is extremely positive according to at least 99.5% of all humans. In fact, those of us who are more pessimistic about the prospect of wide agreement on values might worry that the latter number is (close to) zero, especially if one doesn\u2019t allow for long periods of moral reflection.</p>\n<h2>The measurability of happiness and suffering</h2>\n<p>In my view, there are probably no \u201cobjective\u201d units of happiness or suffering. Thus, it can be misleading to talk about the absolute magnitude of N-ratios without specifying the concrete instantiations of bads and goods that were traded against each other.</p>\n<p>For more details on the measurability of happiness and suffering (or lack thereof), I recommend the essays \u201c<a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/measuring-happiness-and-suffering\">Measuring Happiness and Suffering</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/what-is-the-difference-between-weak-negative-and-non-negative-ethical-views/\">What Is the Difference Between Weak Negative and Non-Negative Ethical Views?</a>\u201d by Simon Knutsson, especially <a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/measuring-happiness-and-suffering/#If_happiness_and_suffering_are_not_sufficiently_measurable_in_principle\">this section</a> and the <a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/measuring-happiness-and-suffering/#Appendix_Objective_non-evaluative_measurement_of_happiness_and_suffering\">description of Brian Tomasik\u2019s views</a> whose approach I share.</p>\n<h2>Other resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>FLI's\u00a0<a href=\"https://futureoflife.org/superintelligence-survey/\">superintelligence</a> survey.</li>\n<li>SlateStarCodex\u2019s <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2016/06/28/survey-results-suffering-vs-oblivion/\">suffering vs. oblivion</a> survey.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/a-small-mechanical-turk-survey-on-ethics-and-animal-welfare/\">Brian Tomasik\u2019s survey</a> on ethics and animal welfare.</li>\n<li>Some parts of the section \u201c<a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/open-research-questions/#Suffering-focused_ethics\">Suffering-focused ethics</a>\u201d of FRI\u2019s Open Research Questions page, in particular the subpage \u201c<a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/tradeoffs-between-good-and-bad-parts-of-lives/\">Tradeoffs between good and bad parts of lives</a>\u201d.</li>\n<li>This <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/1117549958301360/\">survey of effective altruists</a>.\u00a0</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Footnotes</h1>\n<p>[1] For more considerations along these lines, I especially recommend the section \u201cThe value of the future\u201d of the <a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/gpi-research-agenda.pdf\">GPI research agenda</a> (p. 12 - 14).</p>\n<p>[2]\u00a0The term \u201c<a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/utilitarian-exchange-rates/\">exchange rate</a>\u201d is more <a href=\"http://www.amirrorclear.net/academic/ideas/negative-utilitarianism/\">common</a>.</p>\n<p>[3]\u00a0Views with N-ratios greater than 1:1 have also been referred to as \u201c<em>negative-leaning</em>\u201d. Prominent examples include <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_consequentialism\">negative consequentialism</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_utilitarianism\">negative(-leaning) utilitarianism</a>.\u00a0However, the distinction between negative and \u201ctraditional\u201d consequentialism is non-obvious, see e.g. <a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/what-is-the-difference-between-weak-negative-and-non-negative-ethical-views/\">What Is the Difference Between Weak Negative and Non-Negative Ethical Views?</a> (Knutsson, 2016).</p>\n<p>[4]\u00a0Of course, if one person has an E-ratio that is unusually low or unusually high, this presents grounds for concern, as it could indicate a bias or lack of updating towards other people's judgment. Diverging N-ratios could also be subject to the same consideration, but because N-ratios concern normative disagreements, it is less clear to what extent updating towards other people's moral intuitions is demanded by epistemic rationality.</p>\n<p>[5]\u00a0Note that, even for a person with a very high E-ratio and a low N-ratio, interventions that primarily reduce extinction risks are neither necessarily <em>optimal</em> nor as cost-effective as, for instance, interventions that primarily increase the probability of the very best futures (such as certain forms of advocacy).</p>\n<p>[6]\u00a0I\u2019m also ignoring interventions which don\u2019t primarily affect extinction risks or s-risks but e.g. increase the probability of the very best futures.</p>\n<p>[7]\u00a0Particularly the sections \u201c<a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/cause-prioritization-downside-focused-value-systems/#Downside-focused_views_prioritize_s-risk_reduction_over_utopia_creation\">Downside-focused views prioritize s-risk reduction over utopia creation</a>\u201d and \u201c<a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/cause-prioritization-downside-focused-value-systems/#Extinction_risk_reduction_Unlikely_to_be_positive_according_to_downside-focused_views\">Extinction risk reduction: Unlikely to be positive according to downside-focused views</a>\u201d.</p>\n<p>[8]\u00a0Particularly the involuntary, gratuitous suffering of innocent humans.</p>\n<p>[9]\u00a0See also <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/well-being/#TheWelBei\">section 4</a> of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy entry on \u201cWell-Being\u201d.</p>\n<p>[10]\u00a0In this context, see also the appendix for further discussion.</p>\n<p>[11]\u00a0It could be argued that many interventions in this area don\u2019t actually increase s-risks because they will only affect <em>how</em> recovery will happen rather than <em>if</em> it will happen.</p>\n<p>[12]\u00a0However, it does necessarily follow that this person should actually pursue interventions which primarily reduce s-risks. For example, depending on the specifics of her values and other considerations such as neglectedness, tractability, et cetera, interventions that increase the quality of the long-term future while not primarily affecting s-risks might be even more promising.</p>\n<p>[13]\u00a0Cf. Oesterheld (2017, p. 66): \u201cBecause the sample size [of superrationalists] is so small, we may also look at humans in general, under the assumption that the values of superrationalists resemble the values of their native civilization. It may be that the values of superrationalists differ from those of other agents in systematic and predictable ways. General human values may thus yield some useful insights about the values of superrationalists.\u201d</p>\n<p>[14]\u00a0We should not draw too strong conclusions from surveying current superrationalists because they might be atypical in various ways and thus not representative (cf. Oesterheld, 2017, p.71).</p>\n<p>[15]\u00a0One might retort that superrationalists should always focus on staying around so they can help to actualize the values of superrationalists elsewhere in the multiverse. But assuming the average N-ratio of superrationalists is sufficiently high, the possible upside from ensuring good futures in which superrationalists can actualize goods valued by superrationalists elsewhere in the multiverse is likely smaller than the possible downside from failing to prevent bad futures full of suffering or other forms of disvalue. Of course, one\u2019s ultimate decision also has to be informed by one\u2019s E-ratio and by other considerations such as tractability, neglectedness or one\u2019s comparative advantage.</p>\n<p>[16] For example, many people dislike the civilization of \u201cems\u201d depicted in Hanson\u2019s <em><a href=\"http://ageofem.com/\">Age of Em</a></em> although most ems are happy and presumably more similar to humans than the average alien. Generally, it seems that many humans wish that the eventual descendants of humanity retain a lot of their idiosyncratic values and customs. And given the rather unenthusiastic reactions of many readers to the utopian civilization of the \u201c<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/y7/the_super_happy_people_38/\">super happy people</a>\u201d (a race of extraterrestrials depicted in Eliezer Yudkowsky\u2019s short story <em>Three Worlds Collide</em>), it seems not too implausible to conclude that many humans just don\u2019t care much for the existence of alien civilizations elsewhere in the multiverse \u2013 however flourishing and utopian from the perspective of their inhabitants. If one further assumes that superrationalists (here and elsewhere in the multiverse) share these sentiments to some degree but also care at least somewhat about the prevention of suffering (even if experienced by aliens), this suggests that alien superrationalists would want us to prioritize avoiding the worst possible futures over ensuring the existence of a utopian (post-)human civilization. In contrast, the less superrationalists discriminate between the well-being of humans and aliens, the less substantive this line of argumentation.\u00a0Of course, this whole line of\u00a0reasoning is very speculative to begin with, and should be taken with a (big) grain of salt.</p>\n<p>[17]\u00a0See e.g. the sections \u201c<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1COlUvsQa1wFxY7HOt12pK1YI-LgdnvsUJK8bdOg4dAg/edit#heading=h.tozbqsr9fme9\">How to test and control for various biases</a>\u201d and \u201d<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1COlUvsQa1wFxY7HOt12pK1YI-LgdnvsUJK8bdOg4dAg/edit#heading=h.wa2mixups5ho\">Increasing validity and internal consistency</a>\u201c of the document \u201cDescriptive Ethics \u2013 Methodology &amp; Literature Review\u201d for further relevant methodological considerations.</p>\n<p>[18]\u00a0Just as pulling other numerical values (probabilities, cost estimates, etc.) out of thin air and then using these numbers to inform one\u2019s decision is often better than pulling the decision out of thin air (in this context, see e.g. <a href=\"http://www.howtomeasureanything.com/\"><em>How to Measure Anything</em></a> by D.

Please consider applying and, if you know anyone else who might be qualified and interested, please let them know.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>The Future of Humanity Institute</h3>\n<p>Most readers here will likely have heard of them but, if not, the Future of Humanity Institute is a leading research centre within the University of Oxford&#xA0;which looks at big-picture questions for human civilisation. Academics at FHI bring the tools of mathematics, philosophy, social sciences, and science to bear on big-picture questions about humanity and its prospects, seeking to focus their work where&#xA0;they can make the greatest positive difference over the long term. To read more about FHI&#x2019;s work, please see&#xA0;their <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/research/research-areas/\">website</a>.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h3>The Global Priorities Institute</h3>\n<p>The Global Priorities Institute is a newly established research centre, also within the University of Oxford. Its aim is to develop the intellectual roots of the&#xA0;effective altruism movement with an academic level of rigour and detail, and to spread EA theory and concerns throughout academia.&#xA0;Although effective altruism is gaining increasing traction in the non-profit world, it has gained comparatively little within academia and, as a result, may potentially be missing out on valuable contributions from many talented researchers and well-respected figures. GPI seeks to improve this situation.&#xA0;To find out more, please see their <a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/\">website</a>.

The successful candidate will be responsible for effectively putting into practice our plans, particularly in the areas of finance, personnel and administration. S/he will provide comprehensive support in relation to HR matters in both institutes, will oversee the planning and management of their finances and will provide strategic advice on administrative matters.</p>\n<p>This is a challenging role in rapidly expanding areas, requiring a proactive mindset, considerable initiative, intellectual ability and versatility and the readiness and flexibility to do the work required to best achieve the Institutes&#x2019; goals. It will also need excellent operational and organisational skills and significant experience of financial and personnel management. In addition, it requires strengths in general management and in written and oral communication. The Senior Administrator will work largely independently, and will need to relate well to both academic and administrative staff at all levels.</p>\n<p>Candidates should apply online via <a href=\"https://www.recruit.ox.ac.uk/pls/hrisliverecruit/erq_jobspec_version_4.display_form\">this link</a>.

As discussed in the following sections, however, there is more to the story.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Changes in ACE\u2019s assumptions in 2017</span></h2>\n<p><span>Upon further investigation, I found that much of the apparent differences are explained in changes in some of the assumptions in ACE\u2019s cost-effectiveness estimates.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>In 2017, ACE added a new parameter for the \u201cProbability that groups will follow through on the pledges that they made,\u201d and assigned a value of 0.75 for THL. Since this didn\u2019t exist in the 2015 and 2016 estimates, those estimates implicitly assume a probability of 1.00.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><span>In 2015 and 2016, ACE estimates that the \u201cProportional improvement in welfare due to cage-free policies\u201d is ~0.10. That is, moving one hen from a battery-cage to a cage-free facility reduces 10% as much suffering as preventing the hen from existence. In 2017, ACE reduced this estimate further to ~0.05.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>As demonstrated in the following section, applying these changes to 2015 and 2016 causes a decline in cost-effectiveness for these years, and also reduces the apparent decline from 2016 to 2017.</span></p>\n<h2><span>ACE\u2019s cost-effectiveness estimates, adjusted with 2017 assumptions</span></h2>\n<p><span>I think ACE would probably agree that the assumptions described above should apply similarly to 2015 and 2016. Therefore, I\u2019ve adjusted the estimates applying the 2017 assumptions to the previous years as well. With these adjustments, the apparent decline in cost-effectiveness between 2016 and 2017 still remains, but is smaller.</span></p>\n<p><span><img title=\"Chart\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995532/mirroredImages/aZFzgsipkAqd95CBd/jcwiwu9qjuq8yggbkpgh.png\" alt=\"\"></span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>With these adjustments, we also see an increase in \u201cequivalent years of suffering spared,\u201d in contrast to the decrease we saw before these adjustments.</span></p>\n<p><span><img title=\"Chart\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995533/mirroredImages/aZFzgsipkAqd95CBd/gz1j5crkc6kn6e8p7bnr.png\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\n<p><span>The adjustments, however, do not affect the spending, which substantially increased between 2016 and 2017.

It\u2019s likely that much of this groundwork, which included smaller, early wins, was necessary for the 2016 pledges to materialize. Therefore, attributing to the pledges in 2016 to the costs in 2016 may cause the 2016 work to appear more cost-effective than it actually was, while making earlier years appear less cost-effective than they really were. </span></p>\n<p>Moving forward, THL and other organizations are working on securing pledges from corporations to improve the welfare for broiler chickens in the US and layer hens outside the US. While the US cage-free pledges cover most of the 300 million layer hens in the US, representing a very large number of animals, these numbers are still small in comparison to the ~1.1 billion broiler chickens in the US and the ~6 billion layer hens elsewhere.<sup><a href=\"#ftnt8\">[8]</a></sup><span>&nbsp;If THL and other organizations are able to secure pledges for a large proportion these animals over the next few years, it might be correct to attribute much of these pledges to the groundwork done in earlier years, including the smaller wins in 2017.</span></p>\n<p><span><img title=\"Chart\" src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995532/mirroredImages/aZFzgsipkAqd95CBd/tfw5pilyjsdlehjwr2vk.png\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\n<h3><span>Capacity building</span></h3>\n<p><span>The large budget increase in corporate campaigns from 2016 to 2017 represents a large capacity building effort. It\u2019s expected that capacity building may show limited benefits in the short term as employees are hired and trained, even if they yield large benefits in the long term. One consideration against this view, however, is that THL also substantially increased their corporate campaigns budget between from 2015 to 2016, and this increase was associated with a large increase in apparent cost-effectiveness.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Reasons to put limited weight into this analysis</span></h2>\n<p><span>This analysis represents an attempt to understand the apparent changes in cost-effectiveness, but there are multiple reasons not to put too much weight into it.</span></p>\n<h3><span>ACE\u2019s acknowledges the limitations of their cost-effectiveness estimates</span></h3>\n<p>In regard to their <span><a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-reviews/evaluating-charities/evaluation-criteria/our-use-of-cost-effectiveness-estimates/#6\">cost-effectiveness estimates</a></span>, ACE writes:&nbsp;</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>We want to be very clear: our cost-effectiveness estimate<span>s are approximations, they involve uncertain quantitative estimates, and they are subject to bias and error. They are not the only factor we consider when we evaluate interventions and charities\u2014so our readers should interpret them carefully.</span>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>We do not advise our readers to accept our CEEs unquestioningly.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3><span>Comparisons between years could be misleading</span></h3>\n<p>ACE makes no claim that comparing cost-effectiveness estimate<span>s between years will lead to meaningful results, and there are reasons for concern that such comparisons could be misleading.</span></p>\n<p>The adjustments I made for 2015 and 2016 were based on the two obvious changes I observed in ACE\u2019s assumptions. However, there may have been other less obvious changes that affected these estimates. As an example, there\u2019s some ambiguity about what time period each cost-effectiveness estimate<span>&nbsp;covers, and which aspects of the estimates are based on past data vs. future projections. If estimates for different years vary in their approach in these areas, this may reduce the accuracy of these comparisons.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Different metrics would lead to different results</span></h3>\n<p>Although I\u2019m focusing on the metric \u201cequivalent years of suffering spared,\u201d ACE also provides a different metric of \u201cequivalent animals spared.\u201d I prefer to focus on the former because I regard it as more morally relevant, but others might disagree.

And if either of those are your interest, please do come talk to me. I&apos;ll be at the office hours but I&apos;ll also be at the poster session. The starting point of this project is the fact that in my experience, when you introduce the idea of effective altruism to groups of people, you almost always hear &quot;but if everyone gave to AMF, what&apos;s going to happen to cancer research?&quot; And this is a really bad critique. Many people have pointed out that this is a really bad critique for a few different reasons. And I&apos;m not going to dwell on that. What I&apos;m interested in is when you point out that this is a really bad critique to the people raising it, they don&apos;t seem terribly convinced even if they understand why. And so I was looking at whether there&apos;s kind of a better concern hiding in there. Is there something more that they&apos;re getting at?</p>\n<p>And I argue that there is at least a coherent concern that they&apos;re perhaps getting at here. And so it centers around how if we think of an EA world, what is the world we&apos;re thinking about? Now I don&apos;t think we can describe that world in any particular detail, which is kind of it&apos;s own interesting issue. But I think we can say that there would be causes which would go unfunded because they are too ineffective, too expensive. Jonathan touched on this as kind of an inescapable principle that if you have two interventions and one of them is going to save more lives, you go for that intervention. And I actually think this might be the thing that is causing people some concern. Essentially what I&apos;m talking about is people who if you give them the example of Sightsavers vs. guide dogs they agree we should donate to Sightsavers, but they don&apos;t want to live in a world without guide dogs.</p>\n<p>And I think this concern breaks down into two parts. So I think we firstly have a concern about the value of hope - the possibly quite practical value of hope. If people know they&apos;re going to receive no help, they lose hope - this is a loss of welfare, this is a negative thing. And I think that&apos;s a more practical concern that effective altruism can deal with quite easily. We can say well we can just put that into our model. That&apos;s just another welfare concern.</p>\n<p>But I think the second part of this concern is less practical and is an idea about a world without chances, a world that lacks fairness. And the concern here is that when you say that a particular group of people are just going to receive no help whatsoever and have no chance of savior, that is unfair in some way. And so there seems to be an underpinning idea here that if you were to die having had no chance of savior that is somehow worse and somehow unfair compared to you dying having had some chance that you missed out on. So I think if you hold this view of a world without chances, you think it&apos;s unfair to distribute resources in this way, what you probably want is something like a weighted lottery. So you distribute resources according to impact - less effective interventions get less funding, but they won&apos;t get none, so everyone has some chance of help.</p>\n<p>So we then need to ask: is that idea at all reconcilable with effective altruism? And I&apos;ve argued that it really doesn&apos;t seem to be. It seems like if effective altruism tries to accommodate this idea, what it&apos;s really doing is abandoning maximization or at least a typical understanding of maximization. Now I confess since being at the conference and discussing the poster with a few people, some individuals seem to have broader conceptions of effective altruism than I&apos;m familiar with.&#xA0;But it certainly seems like softening to this kind of weighted lottery principle would really change what we understand effective altruism to be by massively redefining how we approach maximization. And to me this seems like a significant concern. Because we don&apos;t actually know how common this view is and I think that&apos;s in itself a bit worrying.</p>\n<p>But if even a fraction of the people who raised the &quot;Ah but if everyone gave to AMF&quot; concern is actually holding this view, then that&apos;s going to pose a massive issue to our movement growth because&#xA0;it isn&apos;t something we can adopt. And so essentially what I would like or what I think it&apos;d be good to have is if any of you happen to be in marketing or psychology or statistics, I think it&apos;d be fantastic to have quantitative data on how many people hold these kinds of views, what are the typical responses to EA. Because currently we have a data driven movement that seems to have a severe lack of data on how we actually grow this movement. And I think if these kinds of views - which seem to clash with principles that we&#xA0;hold to be very obvious - if these kinds of views are common, that is going to to be a huge barrier to the growth of the movement and this is information we desperately need.&#xA0;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>To explore the idea of a weighted lottery system,&#xA0;let&apos;s consider a hypothetical:</p>\n<p>There are 100,000 people with disease A; it costs $5,000 to cure one person of disease A.</p>\n<p>There are 2,400,000 people with disease B; it costs $30,000 to cure one person of disease B.</p>\n<p>The two diseases cause an equal amount of suffering per person.</p>\n<p>We have $100,000,000 to spend. How do we spend it?</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>If our goal is to maximize the number of people cured, then we would spend all of the money on curing people of disease A (resulting in 20,000 people being cured of disease A).</p>\n<p>If our goal is to maximize utility (including hope), then we would presumably choose&#xA0;to spend some amount of money on curing people of disease B.</p>\n<p>But what if we want to use a weighted lottery system? This system could be implemented in several different ways. One way is to allocate money such that the probability of an individual being cured is inversely proportional to the cost of the cure (meaning that the probability of being cured of&#xA0;a given disease goes down as the cost of curing a person of that disease goes up).&#xA0;I&apos;ll refer to this as the proportional chance&#xA0;principle. To figure out how much to allocate to curing people of each disease under this principle, we need to solve a system of equations.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Here are our variables:</p>\n<p>N<sub>A</sub> = number of people who have disease A [100,000]</p>\n<p>N<sub>B</sub> = number of people who have disease B [2,400,000]</p>\n<p>C<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;= cost of curing a person of disease A [$5,000]</p>\n<p>C<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;= cost of curing a person of disease B [$30,000]</p>\n<p>S<sub>T</sub>&#xA0;= total amount of money to be spent [$100,000,000]</p>\n<p>S<sub>A</sub> =&#xA0;amount of money to be spent curing people of disease A [to be determined]</p>\n<p>S<sub>B</sub> = amount of money to be spent&#xA0;curing people of disease B [to be determined]</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Here are our equations:</p>\n<p>1: S<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;+ S<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;= S<sub>T</sub></p>\n<p>2: C<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;/ C<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;= ((S<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;/ C<sub>A</sub>) / N<sub>A</sub>) / ((S<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;/ C<sub>B</sub>) / N<sub>B</sub>) [On the left side, we have the ratio of the cost of curing a person of disease B to the cost of curing a person of disease A. On the right side, we have the ratio of the fraction of people with disease A who are cured to the fraction of people with disease B who are cured. To calculate the fraction of people with a given disease who are cured, we divide the amount allocated to curing people of that disease by the cost of curing a person of that disease to obtain the number of people with that disease who will be cured and then divide the number of people with that disease who will be cured by the total number of people with that disease.]</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Now let&apos;s solve for C<sub>B</sub>.</p>\n<p>C<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;/ C<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;= ((S<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;/ C<sub>A</sub>) / N<sub>A</sub>) / ((S<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;/ C<sub>B</sub>) / N<sub>B</sub>) [Equation 2 from above]</p>\n<p>C<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;/ C<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;= (S<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;/ (C<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;* N<sub>A</sub>)) / (S<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;/ (C<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;* N<sub>B</sub>))</p>\n<p>C<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;* (S<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;/ (C<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;* N<sub>B</sub>)) = C<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;* (S<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;/ (C<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;* N<sub>A</sub>))</p>\n<p>S<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;/ N<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;= S<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;/ N<sub>A</sub></p>\n<p>S<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;+ S<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;= S<sub>T</sub>&#xA0;[Equation 1 from above]</p>\n<p>S<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;= S<sub>T</sub>&#xA0;- S<sub>B</sub></p>\n<p>S<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;/ N<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;= (S<sub>T</sub>&#xA0;- S<sub>B</sub>) / N<sub>A</sub></p>\n<p>S<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;* N<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;= (S<sub>T</sub>&#xA0;- S<sub>B</sub>) * N<sub>B</sub></p>\n<p>S<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;* N<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;= S<sub>T</sub>&#xA0;* N<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;- S<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;* N<sub>B</sub></p>\n<p>S<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;* N<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;+ S<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;* N<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;= S<sub>T</sub>&#xA0;* N<sub>B</sub></p>\n<p>S<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;* (N<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;+ N<sub>B</sub>) = S<sub>T</sub>&#xA0;* N<sub>B</sub></p>\n<p>S<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;= S<sub>T</sub>&#xA0;* N<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;/ (N<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;+ N<sub>B</sub>)</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Plugging in numbers, we get:</p>\n<p>S<sub>B&#xA0;</sub>=&#xA0;100,000,000&#xA0;*&#xA0;2,400,000&#xA0;/ (100,000&#xA0;+&#xA0;2,400,000)</p>\n<p>S<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;= 96,000,000</p>\n<p>S<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;= 100,000,000 - 96,000,000</p>\n<p>S<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;= 4,000,000</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Thus, we have the following allocation:</p>\n<p>We will spend $4,000,000 on helping the 100,000 people with disease A (with each cure costing $5,000).</p>\n<p>We will spend $96,000,000 on helping the 2,400,000 people with disease B (with each cure costing $30,000).</p>\n<p>Now let&apos;s confirm that this allocation complies with the proportional chance principle.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>We&#xA0;cure 800 people of disease A ($4,000,000 / $5,000), which is 1/125 of people with disease A&#xA0;(800 / 100,000).</p>\n<p>We cure 3,200 people of disease B ($96,000,000 / $30,000), which is 1/750 of people with disease B (3,200 / 2,400,000).</p>\n<p>This means that the chance of a person with disease A being cured is six times higher (1/125 / 1/750).</p>\n<p>Since it cost six times more to cure a person of&#xA0;disease B ($30,000 / $5,000), our allocation complies with the proportional chance principle.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>There are three things worth noting about this allocation.</p>\n<p>1. It results in significantly fewer&#xA0;people being cured (4,000 under this allocation (800 + 3,200) vs. 20,000&#xA0;when maximizing the number of people cured).</p>\n<p>2. Look at the&#xA0;equation we got for S<sub>B</sub>: S<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;= S<sub>T</sub>&#xA0;* N<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;/ (N<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;+ N<sub>B</sub>). It only contains N<sub>A</sub>, N<sub>B</sub>, and S<sub>T</sub>. This means that when determining the amount of money to spend curing people of disease B (denoted by S<sub>B</sub>), the only relevant considerations are the total amount of money (denoted by S<sub>T</sub>), the number of people suffering from disease A (denoted by N<sub>A</sub>), and the number of people suffering from disease B (denoted by N<sub>B</sub>); the&#xA0;cost of curing a person of disease A (denoted by C<sub>A</sub>) and the cost of curing a person of disease B (denoted by C<sub>B</sub>) are not relevant.&#xA0;Thus, the same allocation would be used even if the cost of curing a person of disease B doubled.* Because the&#xA0;relative cost-effectiveness of the cures is irrelevant to the allocation of money under the proportional chance principle, <em>the proportional chance principle is literally incompatible with effective altruism.&#xA0;</em></p>\n<p>*Let&apos;s verify that the same allocation would comply with the proportional chance principle even if the cost of curing a person of disease B doubled from $30,000 to $60,000.</p>\n<p>We still spend $4,000,000 on helping the 100,000 people with disease A (with each cure still costing $5,000).</p>\n<p>We still spend $96,000,000 on helping the 2,400,000 people with disease B (though each cure now costs $60,000).</p>\n<p>We still cure 800 people of disease A ($4,000,000 / $5,000), which is 1/125 of people with disease A&#xA0;(800 / 100,000).</p>\n<p>We now cure only 1,600 people of disease B ($96,000,000 / $60,000), which is 1/1,500 of people with disease B (1,600 / 2,400,000).</p>\n<p>This means that the chance of a person with disease A being cured is 12&#xA0;times higher (1/125 / 1/1,500).</p>\n<p>Since it costs 12 times more to cure a person of&#xA0;disease B ($60,000 / $5,000), our&#xA0;new allocation complies with the proportional chance principle.</p>\n<p>To see why doubling the cost of&#xA0;curing a person of disease B has no effect on the allocation, recall our equation for the proportional chance principle:&#xA0;C<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;/ C<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;= ((S<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;/ C<sub>A</sub>) / N<sub>A</sub>) / ((S<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;/ C<sub>B</sub>) / N<sub>B</sub>). As the cost of&#xA0;curing a person of disease B increases&#xA0;(increasing the ratio of the cost of curing a person of disease B to the cost of curing a person of disease A), the share of people with disease B who are cured&#xA0;decreases (proportionally increasing the ratio of the share of people with disease A who are cured to the share of people with disease B who are cured).&#xA0;</p>\n<p>3.&#xA0;Under our allocation, 24&#xA0;times as much money is spent on curing people of disease B ($96,000,000 / $4,000,000). There are also 24 times as many people with disease B (2,400,000 / 100,000). Is this a coincidence? Let&apos;s check by deriving the ratio of spending on curing people of disease A to spending on curing people of disease B under the proportional chance principle.</p>\n<p>We start by deriving&#xA0;the equation for S<sub>A</sub>, the amount spent on curing people of disease A.</p>\n<p>S<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;= S<sub>T</sub>&#xA0;* N<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;/ (N<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;+ N<sub>B</sub>) [This is the equation for S<sub>B&#xA0;</sub>that we derived earlier.]</p>\n<p>S<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;+ S<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;= S<sub>T</sub>&#xA0;[Equation 1 from above]</p>\n<p>S<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;= S<sub>T</sub>&#xA0;- S<sub>B</sub></p>\n<p>S<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;= S<sub>T</sub>&#xA0;- S<sub>T</sub>&#xA0;* N<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;/ (N<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;+ N<sub>B</sub>)</p>\n<p>S<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;= S<sub>T</sub>&#xA0;* (1 - N<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;/ (N<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;+ N<sub>B</sub>))</p>\n<p>S<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;= S<sub>T</sub>&#xA0;* ((N<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;+ N<sub>B</sub>) / (N<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;+ N<sub>B</sub>)&#xA0;- N<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;/ (N<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;+ N<sub>B</sub>))</p>\n<p>S<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;= S<sub>T</sub>&#xA0;* (N<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;+ N<sub>B&#xA0;</sub>- N<sub>B</sub>) / (N<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;+ N<sub>B</sub>)</p>\n<p>S<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;= S<sub>T</sub>&#xA0;* N<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;/ (N<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;+ N<sub>B</sub>)</p>\n<p>Now let&apos;s&#xA0;calculate the ratio of S<sub>A </sub>to&#xA0;S<sub>B</sub>.</p>\n<p>S<sub>A&#xA0;</sub>/&#xA0;S<sub>B&#xA0;</sub>= (S<sub>T</sub>&#xA0;* N<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;/ (N<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;+ N<sub>B</sub>)) / (S<sub>T</sub>&#xA0;* N<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;/ (N<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;+ N<sub>B</sub>))</p>\n<p>S<sub>A&#xA0;</sub>/&#xA0;S<sub>B&#xA0;</sub>= (N<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;* (S<sub>T</sub>&#xA0;/ (N<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;+ N<sub>B</sub>))) / (N<sub>B</sub>&#xA0;* (S<sub>T</sub>&#xA0;/ (N<sub>A</sub>&#xA0;+ N<sub>B</sub>)))</p>\n<p>S<sub>A&#xA0;</sub>/&#xA0;S<sub>B&#xA0;</sub>= N<sub>A </sub>/ N<sub>B</sub></p>\n<p>The ratio of funding for curing people of disease A to funding for curing people of disease B is the same as ratio of the number of people with disease A to the number of people with disease B.

Instead of allocating the same amount of funding per person to each disease regardless of the cost of curing people for each disease, let&apos;s allocate funding such that the funding per person for a given disease is inversely proportional to the cost of curing a person of that disease (meaning that the&#xA0;funding per person for a given disease goes down as the cost of curing a person of that disease goes up).

When it comes to doing the highest impact activity it can seem impossible to be confident in one plan over another. Additionally, new information that comes from further research or even just time passing can make plan A seem better than plan B only to have it switch again the next day. This can cause some people to be lost in analysis paralysis or switch frequently between ideas, making little progress on each one. On the other hand, some people can pick a direction then never update again, constantly leaving impact on the table. </span></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>When I first entered the EA movement I was more the former, spending months on projects only to be convinced that something else was higher impact to work on before the project could be efficiently finished. Not falling prey to sunk cost fallacy, I would switch to the higher impact project and start afresh. Sadly, 10 half finished projects do not equal the value of a single finished project, and although I was always working on what I thought was highest impact at the time, this lack of staying power made the overall output over those years fairly low relative to what it could have been if I had persevered through the projects. Of course, it's also very easy and common to get stuck or committed into a project that is no longer the best choice and some people end up spending their career this way. So the real question becomes how to find a balance between those two. I think Sam Altman puts it quite well:</span></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995629/mirroredImages/e2heLEnbeqTHaJqBf/wqvvzcm25jgdv6wnlzpk.png\"></span></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Although I think the specific numbers can be argued (perhaps it should be 6 months and 3 years) and for EAs generally our focus would be on the highest impact thing instead of the most interesting direction, I think the fundamental pattern is something I have also noticed. Using a strategy like this allows you to finish and mentally commit to large important projects. It also greatly increases the odds of a project coming to fruition. I expect a strategy like this will lead to far higher utility than a more intuitive strategy of \u201cswitch whenever you think something is higher impact than what you are doing\u201d or \u201cswitch when something seems equally high impact but more exciting\u201d. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Systematic exploring and choosing</span></p>\n<p><span>Let\u2019s dive into a bit more detail about what both of these phases might looked like. In the choosing phase you would want to be careful and fair minded, likely doing </span><a href=\"/ea/1lz/why_we_should_be_doing_more_systematic_research/\"><span>systematic research</span></a><span> on a broad range of options to determine the top contenders. You would not want to psychologically commit to any idea but remain impartial during this phase. </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>You likely will find many competing options that look promising, although different in their relative merits. You then want to compare them carefully and get external feedback from other respected peers. This is the best time to get broad feedback as you are not committed to the project and you can directly show the comparison. You could ask a close friend or mentor if they think plan A or B is better and explain the merits of both. You friend could then answer honestly knowing that you have not already made the decision. People often won\u2019t disagree with your plan if you\u2019re already committed for fear of demotivating you or hurting your feelings. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>The biggest enemy will be getting lost in analysis or being too quick to commit to a plan. Setting a specific amount of time for this research can greatly help both these concerns. Time capping is often necessary if you do want to make an endline choice because the truth is there will be very few occasions in project selection when you feel absolutely certain. At the end what you can hope for is making a well informed guess at the best option. And it\u2019s important to learn not to eliminate all uncertainty, but rather develop the art of being confident you made the best choice you could have in the time available. On the other side of the coin, if you\u2019re predisposed to jump into the first good idea that comes along, seeing that you\u2019re only a fraction of a way through the time you set aside for research will remind you that you probably haven\u2019t carefully considered enough of the alternatives. </span></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Relentless focus</span></p>\n<p><span>A common topic in EA is the idea of donation splitting. A less discussed topic is the idea of how to split time between projects. The concept of how much focus to have or how many projects to split time between has applications both personally and organizationally. Many people will put careful analysis into where they donate (even if it's fairly small amounts of money) but not apply the same rigour to volunteering or generally spending time on projects. This is particularly true for projects that are alluring and seem to have minimal time commitments. </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Two common approaches I have seen I will term the 90/10 approach and the heavy focus approach. In this context the 90/10 approach involves spreading one's time over a wide range of projects and getting large amounts of benefit from minimal amounts of time. For example being on the board of many charities or having a full time job and doing several projects on the side. The heavy focus approach involves putting over 90%+ of your working time/energy into a single project (likely you full time job unless you are a student or doing E2G). An example of this might be a staff of an EA organization who does not do any major projects on the side and instead puts more time/energy into working more hours for the organization. </span></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Over time I have become more positive towards the heavy focus approach and less positive towards the 90/10 approach for most EAs, despite continuing to value it in many other topics such as research. One piece of evidence that updated me in this direction was the endline results of individuals that have been focused compared to individuals who have been more spread out. I have found that individuals who spread themselves across many projects tend to have projects slip through the cracks and end up spending time on projects that after a comparative analysis would not compete with the top thing they are working on. When I compare these people to people of seemingly similar abilities but who have a much tighter focus I tend to find they end up with much larger success and not a proportionally lower number of success.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>There are a few possible reasons this could happen. I think there is a heavy cognitive cost of switching your mind between very different projects, leading to less deep and creative thinking than you would expect given the split of hours. Generally part time workers have a harder time making major contributions to an organization and the same principle would seem to hold true between working more or less hours as a full time employee.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>A second possibility is that smaller projects tend to be hit harder by planning fallacy than large ones. If I expect it to take 3 years to start a high impact charity often that has ended up taking 5 years but for many small projects that are high impact, presuming they will only take 10 hours ended up taking orders of magnitude more time than expected. </span><span><br></span><span><br></span><span>Another possibility is that many of the most worthwhile projects are really difficult and require full time attention to have a good chance of being done successfully. To use a personal example, most of my time is spent working on Charity Science Health, a direct poverty charity that is aiming to be GiveWell recommended. This project is sufficiently challenging that our odds are under 50% of being successful, even with almost all my time and energy going into the project. I think founding other charities or for-profits are often similarly challenging, and most of the very worthwhile projects also come with very high levels of difficulty and time commitment. </span></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Plan re-evaluation points</span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>An important concept I often talk about to people starting new and ambitious projects is the idea of plan re-evaluation points. With many ambitious projects, some days your project will be going great and you will feel great about it. During other days it will take all of your energy just to stay positive and everything will feel like it's falling apart. Days like this will come and go for even the best projects. It's great to think carefully about your project\u2019s impact but if, as an EA, you are constantly re-evaluating your project, it will be hard not to abandon it on a hard day/week/month. The solution I propose is set \u201cplan re-evaluation points\u201d where you review your project and plan with fresh eyes and look over all the data you can to see if this project is still worth doing. I think how often to do these varies a bit depending on how long you been on the project. It might start as once every 6 months but move to longer periods until its once every 3 years. These plan re-evaluation points can allow you a deeper level of focused without sliding into questioning your whole project while still ensuring you can update appropriately based on long term trends and evidence. The real trick to be able to hold off between plan re-evaluations is having strong confidence in your initial choosing phase such that you know you made a good call. This system can save a lot of pain and also increase the chance you stay on your project long term. </span></p>\n<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><span>In summary:</span></p>\n<p>- Spend 1 year choosing and 4 years relentless pursuing a project.</p>\n<p>- In the choosing phase, be careful, broad, systematic and uncommitted.</p>\n<p>- In the choosing phase, pick the best option you can in the time you have given yourself.</p>\n<p>- In the focus phase, avoid other projects that might seem like easy wins but will sap your time and energy.</p>\n<p>- In the focus phase avoid major project re-evaluation until set points.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><span>Following these steps I think you can end up with a much higher impact career where you can make major progress on important projects. &nbsp;</span></p>", "user": {"username": "Joey"}}, {"_id": "ccYmLL7KWgAhma6TB", "title": "AI Summer Fellows Program: Applications open", "postedAt": "2018-03-23T21:20:05.203Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>CFAR and MIRI are running an 18-day&#xA0;<strong>AI Summer Fellows Program&#xA0;</strong>(AISFP) in the San Francisco Bay Area from June 27 to July 14.

This paper discusses whether Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI) should be researched, on the controversial ethical assumption that reducing existential risk is overwhelmingly morally important. On the one hand, SAI could eliminate the environmental existential risks of climate change (arguably around a 1% chance of catastrophe), and reduce the risks of interstate conflict&#xA0;associated with extreme warming. Moreover, the risks of termination shock and unilateral deployment are overstated. On the other hand, SAI introduces risks of interstate conflict which are very difficult to quantify. Research into these security risks would be valuable, but also risks reducing willingness to mitigate. I conclude that the decision about whether to research SAI is one of &#x2018;deep uncertainty&#x2019; or &#x2018;complex cluelessness&#x2019;, but that there is a tentative case for research initially primarily focused on the governance and security aspects of SAI.</p>\n<h4>Highlights</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>It is uncertain whether Stratospheric Aerosol Injection(SAI) research is justifiable, but a tentative case be made for security-focused research.</li>\n<li><span>SAI would eliminate the arguable environmental existential risks of climate change (&lt;1% &#x2013; 3.5%).</span></li>\n<li><span>It is extremely unclear whether SAI would reduce willingness to mitigate, and extensive efforts should be made to reduce the risk of mitigation obstruction.</span></li>\n<li><span>Termination shock risk is overstated.</span></li>\n<li><span>The risk of unilateral deployment is overstated, but SAI introduces other serious security risks.</span></li>\n</ul></body></html>", "user": null}, {"_id": "cbdtXGb9nPFvd4tTH", "title": "A rough estimate of social impact of a psychotherapist in QALYs added", "postedAt": "2018-03-19T21:43:46.855Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><em><span>Recently, when I was assessing my career options in terms of impact I prepared a rough estimate of the social impact of psychotherapy. I haven&apos;t encountered such an estimate before - other than in a google sheet calculation that I received from an fellow EA via FB. I thought this might be helpful to people who are interested of doing a more comprehensive review of mental health as a cause.</span></em></p>\n<h3><span>Introduction</span></h3>\n<p><span>This is an attempt to roughly estimate the impact of a psychotherapist in units of QALYs added per therapist-hour. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality-adjusted_life_year\">One QALY corresponds to value of one year lived in perfect health</a>. This estimate is an upper bound for the social impact because it does not take into account the effects of <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2012/08/how-many-lives-does-a-doctor-save/\">diminishing returns and replaceability</a>. Similar estimate has been earlier compiled by Lynette Bye [1].</span></p>\n<h3>Estimate #1</h3>\n<p><span>Following data are from a study on long-term cost-effectiveness of CBT in treating depression [2,3]:</span>&#xA0;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mean annualized QALYs in intervention group 0.596 vs. 0.544 control group (usual care including antidepressants)</li>\n<li>Follow-up 3-5 years after intervention, on average 40 months after therapy ended</li>\n<li>Number of CBT sessions received: 12 &#x2013; 18 (duration 50-60min)</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>Using these data is possible to estimate additional QALYs gained per therapist-hour:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Additional QALYs: 0.596 &#x2013; 0.544 = 0.052 for, on average 40/12 = 3.33 years resulting in 0.052*3.33 = 0.173 QALYs gained.</li>\n<li>15 sessions lasting on average 55 minutes means 15*55/60 = 13.75 hours</li>\n<li>The resulting estimate is 0.173/ 13.75 = 0.0126 QALY/therapist-hour</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span>Estimate #2</span></h3>\n<p><span>A second study on cost-effectiveness of interventions for social anxiety disorder [4] (this is one of the studies included in earlier estimate [1]) contains the following data:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Best CBT treatment (ICBT, C&amp;W) in resulted in average 3.75 QALYs gained vs. waitlist average 3.37 QALYs gained</li>\n<li>Best treatment (ICBT, C&amp;W) included 14 individual sessions, 90 minutes each, resulting in 21 therapist-hours per intervention</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>These data result in an estimate of (3.75-3.37) / 21 = 0.0181 QALY/therapist-hour.</span><span>&#xA0;</span></p>\n<h3><span>Conclusion</span></h3>\n<p><span>The two studies resulted in estimates in the range of 0.012-0.018 QALY/therapist-hour. This is in the same ballpark as the result of earlier calculation [1]: roughly 0.157 QALY / 10 sessions = 0.016 / session.</span></p>\n<p><span>Even though these calculations are based on two, in my opinion high quality studies, the estimate is rough because the basis is just two studies whose QALY estimates contain a fair bit of uncertainty. Secondly, it is unclear how long the effects of therapy persist. Based on these studies, they might persist for a long time (5 years) but it is unclear what is the average effect. Thirdly, improved mental health might have positive secondary network effects for the well-being of patient&#x2019;s immediate social circle, e.g. children, spouse and close relatives. These hypothetical network effects are not included in the estimate.</span></p>\n<p><span>To assess the impact of psychotherapy alone, it is better to compare psychotherapy to treatment as usual without psychotherapy (i.e. pharmacotherapy) rather than no treatment. Estimate #1 compared psychotherapy to usual care whereas estimate #2 compared it to waitlist which makes estimate #1 somewhat more credible. Overall, taking into account the high level of uncertainty involved, I estimate that the impact of psychotherapy is in the range of 0.005-0.03 QALY/therapist-hour for mental health problems with good treatment response to therapy such as depression and social anxiety.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Notes regarding impact over career</span></h3>\n<p><span>By estimating the number of therapist-hours a psychotherapist works over his or her career it is possible to gauge the overall impact. For example, assuming 20 therapist-hours per week, that is 27 45-minute sessions per week, for 45 weeks per year for 30 years one gets an estimate of 20*45*30 * [0.005 &#x2013; 0.03] = 135 &#x2013; 810 QALYs or 5 &#x2013; 27 lives saved using conversion rate of 30 QALYs = &#x201C;1 life saved&#x201D; [5].</span></p>\n<p><span>&#xA0;</span></p>\n<h3><span>Sources</span></h3>\n<p><span>[1] <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nqUwyHHWBiccUkVkP-Mau1MwCdtJeleG-coeLL6U5n8/edit#gid=0\">Counseling impact model: some estimates compiled by Lynette Bye</a></span></p>\n<p><span>[2] Wiles, N.

We&apos;ve just released a new recommended charity quiz that allows users to enter in their specific preferences and outputs the best animal charities that correspond to those values. We believe that this is especially appropriate for effective animal advocacy charities, as there&#xA0;may be a higher level of variance depending on initial values than there would be with human-based charity comparisons.</p>\n<p>When it comes to reaching out to non-EA audiences, we believe that using quizzes like this may allow us to connect more closely with existing animal advocates who are as-yet unfamiliar with EA ideas&#xA0;like focusing on just the &quot;best&quot; charity. We also want to be wary of relying too closely on expected value calculations, since the <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-reviews/evaluating-charities/evaluation-criteria/our-use-of-cost-effectiveness-estimates/\">cost effectiveness estimates we use are approximations, fail to resolve uncertainty, and are subject to bias</a>, even though we do think they are useful for intervention reports and charity evaluations. For these reasons, we believe that this new recommended charity quiz is both appropriate and useful.</p>\n<p>The remainder of this post is copied verbatim from the ACE blog, authored by ACE Research Associate <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/author/jamie-spurgeon/\">Jamie Spurgeon</a>.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>We are excited to announce the launch of our recommended charity quiz. This quiz will allow you to discover charities that match your interests and values, determined by some of the distinguishing features of our recommended charities.</p>\n<p>At ACE we are always looking for new ways to engage with our community and help donors connect with the most effective charities. To this end, we recently released an update to our&#xA0;<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/comparison-of-our-2017-top-and-standout-charities/\">charity comparison chart</a>&#xA0;and now you can use the quiz to receive a personalized recommendation of the three charities that best align with your goals and interests. While we think that reading&#xA0;<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-reviews/all-charity-reviews/\">our reviews</a>&#xA0;is the best way to fully understand why we recommend our Top and Standout Charities, we recognize that reading all of our reviews may take more time than some readers have to invest. The charity quiz can help you to quickly identify charities that you may be particularly interested in, giving you more time to explore those organizations in depth.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/donation-advice/recommended-charities/charity-quiz/\">TAKE THE QUIZ!</a></p>\n<p>The following information is for those more interested in further explanations of the factors explored in the quiz. In general, the quiz aims to capture individual preferences about charity features that aren&#x2019;t clearly good or bad. By measuring the relative importance individuals place on each of these features, we can identify charities that closely align with those preferences.</p>\n<h3>How important is a strong track record of success?</h3>\n<p>This factor is directly related to&#xA0;<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-reviews/evaluating-charities/evaluation-criteria/#c4\">Criterion 4</a>&#xA0;in our comprehensive charity review process. Among the charities we evaluate, there is a large disparity in the strength of their track records, and this is an important consideration for some donors. A charity&#x2019;s track record encompasses at least three factors: (i) the length of time that the charity has been achieving successes, (ii) the number of successes they&#x2019;ve achieved, and (iii) the magnitude of effect those successes have had in creating change for animals.</p>\n<p>The quiz question aims to determine how important the overall effect of these factors are to you, relative to the other traits that make for a promising charity. If you are a potential donor, charities with strong track records may seem to be a safer option as they appear more likely to achieve future successes similar to those seen in the past. However, some donors may not feel that track record is necessarily a strong indicator of future success, or they may simply prefer to support younger charities that could be working in a particularly promising area in which it is possible they will have an even larger impact if successful.</p>\n<h3>Do you prefer to support more established advocacy methods with a lower risk of failure, or would you like to support advocacy that is less established but may have a potentially larger impact?</h3>\n<p>There are other aspects of charities&#x2019; work beyond track record that affect the balance between risk (the chance of future success), and reward (the magnitude of that success). If we recommend a charity that we perceive to be higher risk, then it is often because we feel their potential reward is higher, so these two individual factors tend to remain relatively in balance across all of our charities.</p>\n<p>For example, a charity working in regions where the animal advocacy movement is less developed, such as parts of South America, may be considered higher risk but also higher reward. They may find several advantages to their work:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Wages may be lower, allowing them to achieve more with their budget</li>\n<li>Proven methods from countries with more established animal advocacy movements can be re-used (e.g., using corporate outreach campaigns to secure cage-free commitments for egg laying hens)</li>\n<li>Interventions such as investigations may have a higher impact, as they are less saturated in number<span>1</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>However, there are unknown factors involved with work in some South American countries that may make it less tractable than it initially appears:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The public attitudes towards vegan advocacy may be less favorable, or other unknown cultural differences may affect individuals&#x2019; receptivity to advocacy messaging</li>\n<li>The different legal situation may prohibit the success of some interventions (such as investigations and corporate outreach)</li>\n<li>The political climate may affect the likelihood that legal advocacy work will be successful</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Other examples of charities that might be considered higher risk/higher reward include charities that work on longer-term goals and those that are focusing efforts on highly neglected groups of animals (such as fish). This quiz question aims to capture each donor&#x2019;s preference for higher vs lower risk/reward.</p>\n<h3>Do you prefer to donate to charities with smaller budgets, or larger budgets?</h3>\n<p>During our charity evaluations, we have two main criteria in which we consider a charity&#x2019;s budget&#x2014;<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-reviews/evaluating-charities/evaluation-criteria/#c1\">Criterion 1</a>, which concerns the amount of room for more funding that a charity has, and&#xA0;<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-reviews/evaluating-charities/evaluation-criteria/#c3\">Criterion 3</a>, which concerns the cost effectiveness of the charity&#x2019;s programs. As it is objectively better for a charity to have both a higher room for more funding and a higher cost effectiveness, these are not especially useful metrics for determining a preference that our audience may have. However, the absolute size of a charity&#x2019;s budget often comes with advantages and disadvantages, and the charities we recommend span a large range in this regard. For example, donations to smaller charities will have a greater effect on that charity than a similar donation to a charity with a much larger budget. Additionally, smaller charities are more likely to be working in novel areas. On the other hand, charities that have a larger budget may be able to achieve things that smaller charities can&#x2019;t, such as influencing large food producers in a corporate outreach campaign.</p>\n<h3>How important is it for a charity&#x2019;s work to support the animal advocacy movement as a whole?</h3>\n<p>While most of our recommended charities work to directly cause change for animals, there are some that also (or sometimes solely) work to support the movement as a whole. This includes conducting and publishing research, either in collaboration with other charities or through evaluating their own programs. It also includes charities that take on a more organizational role, providing support to and helping coordinate the efforts of other charities in order to create a greater impact. Charities that are not as supportive of the movement, however, may be less so because they are working in particularly niche or neglected areas, and this may be of particular interest to some donors. Some donors may also simply prefer to support charities that work more directly to create change for animals.</p>\n<h3>Which types of animal advocacy do you want to support?</h3>\n<p>To measure donors&#x2019; preferences for particular interventions, we have divided up the types of animal advocacy interventions into three main groups: traditional advocacy, institutional advocacy, and innovative advocacy.<span>2</span>&#xA0;Traditional advocacy includes interventions that have been commonly used by the movement for more than 10 years and often aim to create individual changes in attitudes or behavior&#x2014;such as the adoption of veganism. These interventions include&#xA0;<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/advocacy-interventions/interventions/leafleting/\">leafleting</a>, protesting, and undercover investigations, among many others. Institutional advocacy includes any interventions that target institutions&#x2014;from large international corporate food producers to smaller institutions such as schools and hospitals. Finally, innovative advocacy encompasses more novel areas of advocacy&#x2014;including the development of cultured and plant-based meat, securing legal rights for animals, and conducting or facilitating research into wild animal suffering. These tend to be more ambitious approaches that have large potential for change, but that also have more uncertainty surrounding whether their end goals will be achieved.</p>\n<h3>Putting it all together</h3>\n<p>We have given each of our recommended charities featured in the quiz a subjective score for each topic that is covered by a question or a particular response. As you go through and specify your preferences, the quiz uses your responses to weight the scores given to each charity. It then recommends the three charities that most closely align with the preferences you indicated. Expressing a strong preference for a particular question puts a higher weight on that factor when calculating your matches.</p>\n<p>If you have any further questions, please leave a comment here or submit a feedback form at the end of the quiz. Don&#x2019;t forget to share your results!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/donation-advice/recommended-charities/charity-quiz/\">TAKE THE QUIZ!</a></p>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>We expect that the U.S. is reaching a point where the large number of investigations released means that future investigations are likely to start to have diminishing returns.&#xA0;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>It&#x2019;s difficult to divide interventions into distinct categories, as often those categories will overlap. For example, while protesting and undercover investigations are examples of established advocacy interventions, they are both also used to support institutional campaigns. However, as multiple answers can be selected for this question, we hope this won&#x2019;t significantly skew our quiz results.&#xA0;</p>\n</li>\n</ol></body></html>", "user": {"username": "EricHerboso"}}, {"_id": "qPTwC53TqiJw6Pgcw", "title": "Enlightened Concerns of Tomorrow", "postedAt": "2018-03-15T05:29:29.854Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><em>I&apos;ve written the below as a response to Steven Pinker&apos;s new book &quot;Enlightenment Now&quot; and specifically a dedicated chapter he wrote on existential threats.</em></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Enlightenment Now</strong></p>\n<p>Steven Pinker&#x2019;s works span the fields of cognitive psychology, linguistics and human nature. His book &#x201C;The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined&#x201D; provided a strong voice against the prevailing rhetoric that human violence has been increasing. His assertions have not been without criticism, but for many, his evidence-based arguments have been a welcome dissident voice filled with seemingly justified optimism against prevailing unsupported cynicism about human nature.</p>\n<p>Pinker&#x2019;s latest book &#x201C;Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism and Progress&#x201D; is a continuation within the theme of optimism. Starting with a summary of the building block ideals of the Enlightenment, he weaves data and statistics to tell a story of positive human progress. Pinker lays a foundation for discussing contemporary topics of concern, ranging from inequality to terrorism, the environment to the quality of life, arguing that by all relevant measures most human affairs have improved drastically, and asserting that knowledge and technology will alleviate most of our persisting worries in time. He writes, &#x201C;&#x2026; there is no limit to the betterments we can attain if we continue to apply knowledge to enhance human flourishing.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Existential Threats</strong></p>\n<p>However, carrying this optimism forward brazenly, he is quick to dismiss the notion that humans are at risk of future catastrophes. In a dedicated chapter entitled &#x201C;Existential Threats&#x201D; he caricatures those worried about global catastrophic risks as Luddites who are sounding an unfounded alarm about emerging and anthropogenic threats to humanity. He lists the Future of Humanity Institute as one of the &#x201C;Techno-philanthropist [&#x2026;] bankrolled research institutes dedicated to discovering new existential threats and figuring out how to save the world from them.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>This focus on existential threats seems potentially dangerous from Pinker&#x2019;s point of view, and he argues that concerns about catastrophic risks can itself have unintended negative consequences. He cites the 1960&#x2019;s nuclear arms race and the 2003 invasion of Iraq as examples of times that fears about hypothetical disasters endangered humanity instead of protecting it. He later argues that human behaviour changes for the worse when contemplating possible demise, and that the &#x201C;cumulative psychological effects of the drumbeat of doom&#x201D; should be given consideration. He does not, however, suggest a mechanism by which to weigh these potentially negative consequences against possible catastrophic events, or suggest a threshold by which we should concern ourselves with potential existential threats.&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Pinker goes on to argue that the notion of civilisation able to destroy itself is misconceived.&#xA0; He likens present concerns about existential risks caused by Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a &#x201C;21st-century version of the Y2K bug.&#x201D; He seems to misunderstand some basic tenets of AI safety research, citing that &#x201C;Understanding does not obey Moore&#x2019;s Law: knowledge is acquired by formulating explanations and testing them against reality, not by running an algorithm faster and faster.&#x201D; He suggests the main concern in AI safety is the development of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and infers that the relative temporal distance of AGI makes it of little concern. With regards to developing a &#x2018;Doomsday Computer&#x2019; he suggest &#x201C;The way to deal with this threat is straightforward: don&#x2019;t build one.&#x201D; However, this negates the concerns within the AI safety community that such technological developments may not be intentional or foreseen, but inadvertently created.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Global Catastrophic Biological Risks</strong></p>\n<p>In Pinker&#x2019;s discussion on the topic of bioterrorism, he becomes ensnared in the Normalcy bias, purporting that the lack of role that biological weapons has played in modern warfare since the international prohibition in 1972 by the Biological Weapons Convention is sufficient reason to believe they will never pose an existential threat. This is a common problem when thinking about unprecedented risks, because their never-before-seen characteristic makes them difficult for most humans to consider.&#xA0; Nonetheless, the counsel of science suggests our intuition can be an unreliable guide to reality, and the counsel of history warns that the past does not always augur the future well.</p>\n<p>Engineered pathogens of pandemic potential are a novel threat with consequences that are difficult to ascertain, but may be trajectory-altering for humankind. While Pinker discusses possible augmentations to pathogens that increase their transmissibility, virulence and durability, he also states &#x201C;&#x2026; breeding such a fine-tuned germ would require Nazi-like experiments on living humans that even terrorists (to say nothing of teenagers) are unlikely to carry off.&#x201D; This ignores the recent apposite case of horsepox virus being synthesized <em>de novo</em> and resurrected by a team of scientists in Canada for $100,000. Small-scale actors engineering &#x201C;fine-tuned germs&#x201D; seems more conceivable everyday.</p>\n<p>Pinker asserts that risk assessments, which vary by orders of magnitude for highly improbable events, is a reason in itself to set aside worries about global catastrophic events. He states bluntly &#x201C;You can&#x2019;t worry about everything.&#x201D; This is true to perhaps to a technical extent, but there is a large difference between &#x201C;everything&#x201D; and low probability, high impact risks. Indeed, it has been demonstrated that uncertainty in risk assessments does not negate cause for consideration, but instead adds to the reason for concern.<sup>1</sup> Furthermore, there is a strong case for considering low probability, high impact risks that may threaten human extinction and all future generations.<sup>2</sup> Given the astronomical number of lives that could exist in the future,<sup>3</sup> reducing the risk of their non-existence even by a small factor is a worthwhile endeavour.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>\n<p>Global Catastrophic Risks are an emerging phenomenon in a fast-evolving risk landscape filled with uncertainty. As with all new technologies and unprecedented advances, the lack of historical precedence carries little weight against their consideration as a plausible existential threat to humanity. Criticism is a valuable tool that invokes debate and refinement, however, hasty dismissal does not allow for balanced discourse on a topic that potentially could be of existential importance.</p>\n<p>Pinker concedes that he can offer no assurance that global catastrophe will never happen, instead insisting that &#x201C;we can treat them not as apocalypses in waiting but as problems to be solved.&#x201D; However, these solutions rely upon the hard work and due concern of individuals to mitigate risks that threaten the existence of civilisation and future generations.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>References</strong></p>\n<p><sup>1&#xA0;</sup>Ord T, Hillerbrand R, Sandberg A.

However, not all research is created equal. Systematic research can often lead to very different conclusions than more typical research approaches. Some areas of EA have been systematic in their research. Others have a lot to gain from improving in this area. In this article I&#x2019;ll first give a quick definition of systematic research, then give some examples relevant to EA.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>What is systematic research</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>The main thing that distinguishes systematic research from non-systematic is planning and thoroughness. An example of unplanned research is when you&#x2019;re wandering page to page on Wikipedia. You think of a question that interests you or seems relevant, then a fact triggers another question which you then follow up with, etc. An example of planned research is a meta-analysis. Meta-analyses usually state in advance the question they are trying to answer, where they&#x2019;ll look for answers, what studies will qualify and which won&#x2019;t, etc. Another way to systematize research is to </span><a href=\"/ea/14a/using_a_spreadsheet_to_make_good_decisions_five/\"><span>use spreadsheets </span></a><span>to lay out all of the options and criteria you&#x2019;ll consider in advance. You can see more examples </span><a href=\"/ea/14a/using_a_spreadsheet_to_make_good_decisions_five/\"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>The other aspect is thoroughness. This usually happens because it&#x2019;s planned, and if you follow a procedure, you are more likely to do the thing you already know you should do. For example, it&#x2019;s a commonly accepted rationalist virtue to look for disconfirming evidence or look at more than two options/hypotheses, but it&#x2019;s very easy to forget to do so if you haven&#x2019;t explicitly added it to your system. Setting up a plan just makes you much more likely to follow best practices. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>With that defined, below are some examples of where EA could benefit from more systematicness. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Places it&#x2019;s under utilized in the EA movement </strong></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Relative to other communities, EA research is on average quite systematic. Charity evaluators in particular tend to be more systematic to avoid missing promising but less well known charities. However, there are several other areas that we could stand to be a lot more systematic. I will give three examples. A whole blog post or several could be written on each of these topics, but hopefully even with relatively little detail on each it will start to be clear there are areas EA could be a lot more systematic. </span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Historical research:</span><span> A few EA organizations rely on historical evidence to support the claim that what they are doing is high impact, but history is a great example of an area where it&apos;s easy to find support for or against any idea you&#x2019;d like. For example, if you are making a case that protests have been successful in helping social movements succeed, it will be straightforward to find examples showing that is true. However, there will also be many examples where protests have either done nothing or even hurt a movement. A systematic way for the research to be done might be to compare the top 100 social movements (as decided by an unbiased selection criteria like a Wikipedia list) on an objective metric of success (e.g. passing a related law, like abolishing slavery or women getting the right to vote). Then you could list all of the different strategies they used, then pull correlations between the top 10 most used strategies and the success level of the movement. That would dramatically change the landscape on how seriously one could take a claim that X strategy is better than Y strategy based on historical evidence. Sadly, non-systematic research on this topic generally leads to results very similar to the researchers&#x2019; starting hypothesis, which makes it hard to weigh this evidence as a strong update in any direction. </span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Reference classes:</span><span> A lot of EA debates come down to which reference class you choose, but this is very rarely done in a systematic way. Take for example a conversation I had where another EA and I were trying to determine the likelihood of a breakthrough happening in psychology. The discussion went back and forth with little progress, but then was largely helped when we did some systematic research with pre-set criteria. Specifically, we looked at how many psychologists have a Wikipedia page, which was generally seen as what we would expect to see at a minimum from a breakthrough, and compared this to how many people had a psychology PhD and were working in experimental psychology. Although this reference class was imperfect, it was objective, looked at both the hits and the misses instead of just the former, and helped inform our views. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Of course, specific reference classes might be hard to agree upon, but even when people do agree on them, very rarely does the research itself seem to be done, and often even if they are not perfectly agreed on, this can shed light on the issue. For example, </span><a href=\"/ea/14s/how_many_hits_does_hitsbased_giving_get_a/\"><span>systematic research could be done on hits based giving</span></a><span>. There are certainly hits that can be listed, but what would be ideal is to look at the number and size of the hits compared to the number of attempts and the total resources put into gettings hits. This would definitely take time, but give a much more reliable result than intuition.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Criteria:</span><span> EA has a pretty common set of criteria that several organizations have adopted: neglectedness, tractability and importance. The broad idea being that these criteria proxy the more difficult to directly quantify total good done per dollar spent metric. However, no systematic evaluation of how these criteria perform or what other criteria was considered and how well they fared has been put forward publicly. For example, what if evidence base correlates stronger with &#x201C;good per $&#x201D; than neglectedness does. What if there are several other criteria that should be used in combination to make a better model (maybe five criteria should be used instead of three)? Of course the words are sufficiently broad that much criteria you could list could fall under one or other (e.g., maybe evidence falls under tractability), but in practice, evaluating evidence base vs tractability leads to very different conclusions on the strength of many different cause areas. It seems unlikely that we have picked the best possible criteria for cause selection unless we have rigorously and systematically comparing several different options. If our criteria changes significantly, it seems very likely this could influence what is considered an EA cause area or not, so it certainly seems worth the additional time. &#xA0;</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>In summary, systematic research is slower and less fun than the alternative. However, I argue that the benefits of following best practices such as looking for disconfirming evidence and considering multiple options and hypotheses, more than make up for those costs, particularly for important issues like the examples above.</span></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Joey"}}, {"_id": "3oukNayDZXWLzte7c", "title": "EA Survey: Sexual Harassment Questions - Feedback Requested", "postedAt": "2018-03-14T15:07:05.694Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>I interested Tee Barnett and Peter Hurford in adding sexual violence questions to the survey.

Some people seem to want to avoid talking about this to prevent women from being scared off. Women are being targeted by sex offenders. They are going to notice that. Sex offenders are scaring people off whether we talk about it or not.<br><br>If we want to be rigorous enough to have meaningful survey results, we *need* to compensate for survivorship bias. I have no doubts about that.<br><br>Lists of EA Global attendees from different years can be compared to see how many people returned and how many people did not. CEA won&#x2019;t release their data. There is a quick and dirty way to accomplish a rough estimate without the data. CEA told me they&#x2019;d run a script that:<br><br></li>\n<ol>\n<li>Compares the full names of attendees of EA Global from two different years to see which people returned to the conference and which people did not. (Keeping the names a secret.)<br><br></li>\n<li>Counts the number of &#x201C;male&#x201D; and &#x201C;female&#x201D; names (and ambiguous names) on each side. (Based on a database of baby names which includes the gender they&#x2019;re usually assigned to.)<br><br></li>\n<li>Outputs a table containing the total number of names in each category that did and did not attend both events.</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<p><br>An r or python script can be run in an installation of r statistics on one of the CEA computers. *Only* the table containing the completely anonymized numerical totals needs to be shared. So yes, this is quick and dirty and would only output a rough estimate. The only way to get really accurate data is for CEA to have an internal person write the script.<br><br></p>\n<ol>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Definitional quagmires.</strong> Sadly, the definitions of sexual violence vary a lot from one source to the next, and this even applies to the sources that are supposed to be credible like legal definitions, psychology definitions, and research definitions. Worse, all of the definitions I have seen so far are completely insane in at least one respect. For instance, the CDC definition classifies male rape via penile envelopment as a different kind of sex offence, as if it is not rape. It is *not* included in the number of rapes! For some reason, a lot of definitions of stalking require that the person stalks you more than once. What if the stalker follows you around and successfully attacks you on the first try? I guess someone decided that when stalkers are especially effective at what they do, they aren&#x2019;t really stalking after all? Insane. A lot of the definitions I&#x2019;ve seen contain something nutty like this.<br><br></li>\n<ol>\n<li>No standardized definitions.</li>\n<li>Lots of definitions include at least one really insane loophole.</li>\n<li>All the terms are ambiguous because a lot of people refuse to report sex offences if they have to be specific. This is reminiscent of what happened to user agent values in the browser wars though it happens for a different reason. (They started having browsers lie to websites about which browser they are as a chaotic way to manage competitions over features and compatibility, so the identifiers became pretty muddled.)<br><br></li>\n<li>Humans respond to incentives with motivated reasoning, cognitive biases and other forms of irrationality. This means that the definitions we use must be resistant to people coming along and to tear them down simply because a state of denial is a lot more pleasant.<br><br></li>\n<li>Sexual violence definitions do not have a utilitarian basis like how much suffering they cause. This is probably because there can be many differences between an event that is upsetting vs. an event which does not. If a dog sniffs your crotch, you will probably be annoyed but not traumatized. If an adult human did that, it would be very upsetting. Why? The dog is smaller. The dog probably isn&#x2019;t expressing interest in you. The dog has no political power whatsoever. The dog may be expressing friendly emotions rather than sadism, dominance, etc. Probably other reasons. There are many contextual things like this which result in a huge amount of confusion and also make it extremely hard to define sexual violence in a utilitarian way. A lot of people in our network are interested in whether every type of behavior that qualifies as a sex offence causes harm.<br><br></li>\n<li>The main benefit of utilizing a common set of sexual violence definitions is that we&#x2019;ll easily be able to compare our rate of sex offences to external rates of sex offences to know whether it is elevated or not. The main downside of utilizing a commonly used set of sexual violence definitions is that most of them include something insane. Unless we can find a credible source of sexual violence definitions which has no insane loopholes, we will need to choose between comparability and sanity.</li>\n</ol>\n<li><strong>Insufficient understanding of sexual responses and preferences:</strong> Some people never experience sexual trauma, or are not as likely to experience it due to some kind of trait. Perhaps they did not receive the genes for trauma at all, or the genes for sexual trauma specifically, or they experience sexual traumas under a totally different set of conditions from others.<br><br>From what I&#x2019;ve been seeing, I am really starting to suspect that there are multiple &#x201C;orientations&#x201D; around consent needs and what situations are experienced as sexual violence. Some people vehemently deny that sex offences cause harm or act like harm is rare when research shows it is not. I think what&#x2019;s happening is that people with non-standard sexual responses and sexual preferences tend to construct bubbles based on these traits. They may not realize they are living in a bubble and that the rest of us really do experience sexual trauma.<br><br>There isn&#x2019;t a definition that such people will find credible because the crux is not about verbiage for them. What they would find credible is an explanation as to why some people claim X is harmful while others claim X was enjoyable or did not cause harm.<br><br>My best answer for them is that most people probably experience sexual trauma, while those who don&#x2019;t experience it (or who have different conditions for it) probably at least sometimes end up in social bubbles with others who have different sexual responses and behaviors.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t know all the details, and I may only see the tip of the iceberg. Right now, I&#x2019;m pretty sure that some people need both explicit verbal consent and monitoring for enthusiasm in order to function sexually and avoid trauma. Others require body language (Or perhaps other cues? I am not one of these people.) to function sexually, and have literally reported that using explicit verbal consent actually causes them dysfunction. One person reported that this is *in spite of* the risk of trauma, *not* because the risk of trauma is absent.<br><br>To make it more complicated, I think there are kinky people in both the explicit consent and body language camps. That is to say I think some kinky people sexually dysfunction if they can&#x2019;t use body language and must use explicit verbal consent.<br><br>Such people are not going to cease their sexual behaviors because others function a different way. They wouldn&#x2019;t function at all then. At this time, I think it is safest for everyone to encourage people to form different bubbles that all members are comfortable with. Vilifying comfortable bubble creation doesn&#x2019;t make much sense. I think the people in each bubble just need to be aware that there are people in various other bubbles who genuinely have different responses and preferences.<br><br>I think right now there are a lot of misunderstandings because the people in the different bubbles don&#x2019;t even believe that the other bubbles really exist for sure, let alone do people from each bubble know how the other people work. We&#x2019;ve all been viewing each other&#x2019;s bubbles as if they are non-existent, imaginary or dysfunctional.<br><br>I think if people shared openly the consent philosophy that they prefer others to use on them, this would help immensely with preventing confusion when people in multiple bubbles mix. I think this has the potential to reduce sexual violence because it will reduce confusion between those who need explicit verbal consent and those who need to use body language. There may be a lot of other differences I am unaware of, so I will leave off with a hope that people will communicate more clearly in the future to prevent misunderstandings.<br><br>Important:<br><br>Bubbles are *not* a complete solution. This is because some people literally have preferences like &#x201C;doing stuff you&#x2019;re not supposed to do&#x201D; / &#x201C;doing unwanted things&#x201D;. Yes, I do mean that there are people who do this *without* hoping to delight the other person. (Some sadists and dominants prefer to delight masochists and submissives while others just go for anybody without consideration, and some actually intend to cause people harm.)<br><br>Others have problems along the lines of a strong mind projection fallacy which results in them believing others reciprocate their interest when this is not true. This bias might be bad enough to cause a sex offence. Additionally, it seems that many people experience so much motivated reasoning that they rape people even though they experience empathy and should theoretically be able to tell that they&#x2019;re doing something harmful. I guess, for some, the motivated reasoning and bias that can happen during mating experiences is deeply confusing.<br><br>Then there are people who take more risk with sex or kink than they intend to and someone ends up unnecessarily harmed through a lack of education. So, unfortunately, there are a bunch of things that can result in people getting hurt even if everyone aims to communicate really well and people stick to dating/hookups/play with others who share a compatible consent philosophy.<br><br>\n<p>If we use a mainstream source of sexual violence definitions, it will stigmatize people who need to use body language rather than explicit verbal consent. They probably aren&#x2019;t going to change their behavior, since that would result in sexual dysfunction. Also, I&#x2019;m concerned that there probably is not enough research on people with this preference for us to have any understanding of them. Without thorough research, stigma is unjustified.<br><br>If we don&#x2019;t use definitions that require explicit verbal consent, this may open the floodgates for a lot of people who are confused by motivated reasoning and bias. It is probably safer if people prone to motivated reasoning and bias do *not* try to use body language to figure out what others want. They need to work extra hard to make distinctions and I suspect it helps them to be told clearly and explicitly what is wanted.<br><br></p>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Cognitive biases, motivated reasoning, and incentives.</strong>\n<ol>\n<li>Optimism bias:<br>The tendency to expect things to be more pleasant than they are.<br><br></li>\n<li>Normalcy bias:<br>The tendency to fail to plan in advance for disasters and to respond inappropriately when one is underway.<br><br></li>\n<li>Ostrich effect bias:<br>Ignoring an obvious negative situation.<br><br></li>\n<li>Affect heuristic:<br>Being more likely to believe information that is pleasant than information that is unpleasant.<br><br></li>\n<li>Status quo bias:<br>Being more likely to support the status quo.<br><br></li>\n<li>Survivorship bias:<br>Focusing on who or what is left / failing to take into account who or what is gone.</li>\n<li>Sour grapes bias:<br>Telling yourself that what you&#x2019;ve lost wasn&#x2019;t desirable anyway.<br><br></li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Proposed definitions:</strong></p>\n<p>The things I care about the most are things like whether someone is traumatized, whether they become suicidal and whether they leave or intend to leave the movement or their job.</p>\n<p>What would be *really* interesting is to ask *both* &#x201C;did things A, B, or C happen to you&#x201D; *and* &#x201C;did it cause you to experience X, Y, Z harm&#x201D;?<br><br>This would be long because there&#x2019;d be a subset of questions *about* each of the questions in the main set. Also, since multiple offences can happen to one person, you&#x2019;d need to be able to answer each question and subset question more than one time. This sounds complicated and I&#x2019;m not sure it will happen since surveys have length constraints.</p>\n<p>This would be awesome because we would have an opportunity to understand this so much better by taking a peek at which behaviors cause the most harm.</p>\n<p>If it needs to be concise, I&#x2019;m imagining something like this:</p>\n<ol>\n<ol>\n<ol>\n<li>What consent philosophy do you prefer others use on you? (If you use a particular variation on a consent philosophy, please specify.)<br><br></li>\n<li>Where is your consent philosophy documented? (Please link to the specific variation if possible.)<br><br></li>\n<li>How many times did any EA violate your consent philosophy with speech that appeared to be motivated by sexual or romantic desire?<br><br></li>\n<li>How many times did any EA violate your consent philosophy with exhibitionism that appeared to be motivated by sexual or romantic desire?<br><br></li>\n<li>How many times did any EA violate your consent philosophy with voyeurism that appeared to be motivated by sexual or romantic desire?<br><br></li>\n<li>How many times did any EA violate your consent philosophy with touching that appeared to be motivated by sexual or romantic desire?<br><br></li>\n<li>How many times did any EA violate your consent philosophy with following, intruding or spying (non voyeurism) that appeared to be motivated by sexual or romantic desire?<br><br></li>\n<li>How many of the aforementioned instances of violations had a significant negative impact on your psychological health?<br><br></li>\n<li>How many of the aforementioned instances of violations resulted in suicidal thoughts?<br><br></li>\n<li>How many of the aforementioned instances of violations resulted in a desire to leave an EA job?<br><br></li>\n<li>How many of the aforementioned instances of violations resulted in a desire to leave the EA movement?<br><br></li>\n<li>If applicable, please list all the types of EA spaces where the aforementioned instances of sexual harassment or sexual violence happened. (examples: EA share house, EA organization, EA conference, EA work party, an unrelated cafe, a park, etc.).<br><br></li>\n<li>What do you think might have prevented the violation(s) of your consent philosophy?<br><br></li>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n</ol>\n<p>This wouldn&#x2019;t give us the sort of result that&#x2019;s directly comparable to external sexual violence statistics. However, it would give us the sort of result we care about: whether people&#x2019;s preferred consent philosophies are being violated, and whether the violations are causing harm. Most importantly, we&#x2019;d actually have some data about the impact on specific areas including psychological health, suicidal thoughts, turnover intentions, and intentions to leave the community.</p>\n<p>The results would be harder to compare from one year to the next because tying sexual violence definitions to people&#x2019;s individual ideas about consent adds more complexity than brutalizing all the subtleties to create standardized verbiage. It *is* possible to make survey results comparable *if* people put in the effort to thoroughly document all the different sets of preferences they have, name each consent philosophy or variation, and publish these. I think encouraging people to do this is a good thing because it encourages us to deepen our understanding and communicate more clearly.</p>\n<p>Tying the definition to people&#x2019;s individual preferences just seems a lot more sane than trying to come up with sexual violence definitions that work for everybody at a time when so much more research needs to be done to understand all the variation in responses and preferences, not to mention solving whatever it is that has been resulting in insane loopholes.</p>\n<p>Nonetheless, I think something in this general direction would be much better at tracking the things we care about the most: whether preferences are being respected, and whether harm is being done.</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;m not an expert on designing surveys. There will be people on the survey team looking this over and it may need to be changed.

This article is written for an audience of people familiar with cause prioritization and other important <a href=\"https://concepts.effectivealtruism.org/\">effective altruism concepts</a> and who have considered arguments for the importance of long-term impact. To others it may seem confusing unless they get their bearings first through reading such books as <em>Doing Good Better</em> and <em>Superintelligence</em>.</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;m aware of many arguments for the great importance of long-term strategic planning, but when &#x201C;long-term&#x201D; refers to millenia and more, it becomes unintuitive that we should be able to have an influence on it today with any but miniscule probability. I&#x2019;m hoping to avoid having to base my work on <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pascal%27s_mugging\">Pascal&#x2019;s Mugging</a>&#x2013;type of scenarios where enormous upsides are used to compensate their miniscule probability for a still-high expected value. So I need to assess when, in what cases, or for how long we can influence the long term significantly and with macroscopic&#xA0;probabilities.</p>\n<p>Then I need heuristics to be able to compare, very tentatively, interventions that all can&#x2019;t rely on feedback cycles or only on feedback cycles around unreliable proxy&#xA0;measures.</p>\n<p>Finally, I would like to be able to weigh assured short-term impact (in the sense of &#x201C;a few centuries at best&#x201D;) against this long-term impact and develop better heuristics for understanding today which strategies are more likely or unlikely to have long-term&#xA0;impact.</p>\n<div>\n<p>Reservations</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The heuristics I&#x2019;m using are not yet part of some larger model that would make it apparent when there are gaps in the reasoning. So there probably are huge gaps in the&#xA0;reasoning.</li>\n<li>In particular, I&#x2019;ve come up with or heard about the heuristics during a time when I got increasingly excited about Wild Animal Suffering Research, so I may have inadvertently selected them for relevance to the intervention or even for being favorable to it.<sup><a href=\"#fn-heuristics-collection\">1</a></sup></li>\n<li>I&#x2019;m completely ignoring considerations related to infinity, the simulation hypothesis, and faster-than-light communication or travel for now. Especially the simulation hypothesis may be an argument why even slight risk aversion or a slight quantization of probability can lead to a greater focus on the short&#xA0;term.</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<h2>Comparing&#xA0;Causes</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/problem-framework/\">The importance, neglectedness, tractability (<span>INT</span>) framework</a> (or scale, crowdedness, solvability) provides good guidance for comparing between problems (also referred to as causes). It can be augmented with heuristics that make it easier to assess the three&#xA0;factors.</p>\n<h3>Upward&#xA0;Trajectories</h3>\n<p>One addition is a heuristic or consideration for assessing scale (and plausibly tractability) that occurred to me and that seems to be very important provided that we are able to make our influence felt over sufficiently long&#xA0;timescales.</p>\n<p>I care primarily about reducing suffering (in the broad sense of <a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/the-case-for-suffering-focused-ethics/\">suffering-focused ethics</a> not specifically negative utilitarianism),<sup><a href=\"#fn-antirealism\">2</a></sup> so I want my <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnxuYmVja3N0ZWFkfGd4OjExNDBjZTcwNjMxMzRmZGE\">trajectories</a> to point downward. Suffering of humans from poverty-related diseases <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Better_Angels_of_Our_Nature\">has long been</a> <a href=\"https://www.gatesfoundation.org/Who-We-Are/Resources-and-Media/Annual-Letters-List/Annual-Letter-2014\">going down</a>. If I were to get active in that area and actually succeed quite incredibly, the result may look like the chart&#xA0;below.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://claviger.net/images/cause-selection-2018/speeding-up-existing-development.png\" alt=\"Speeding up an existing development\"></p>\n<p>Here the sum of the two darker areas is the counterfactual suffering over time and the lighter area is the difference that I&#x2019;ve made compared to the counterfactual without&#xA0;me.</p>\n<p>But consider the case where I pick out something that I think has an increasing&#xA0;trajectory:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://claviger.net/images/cause-selection-2018/dampening-negative-development-short-term.png\" alt=\"Dampening a negative development in the short term\"></p>\n<p>When we zoom out,<sup><a href=\"#fn-clustering\">3</a></sup> this starts to look really&#xA0;big:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://claviger.net/images/cause-selection-2018/dampening-negative-development-long-term.png\" alt=\"Dampening a negative development in the long term\"></p>\n<p>In this simplified model, the impact of interventions that can and conceivably will solve the issue they&#x2019;re addressing can be curtailed by intersecting with y = 0 if our influence is sufficiently&#xA0;durable.</p>\n<p>This is a heuristic of scale and tractability. It is straightforward that the scale of a problem that is nigh infinite over all time is greater than that of a problem that is&#xA0;finite.</p>\n<p>In practice, we will probably see an asymptotic approach toward the x axis as the cost-effectiveness of more work in the area drops further and further. This is where tractability comes in. As you approach zero disutility within some reference class, there is usually some decreasing marginal cost-effectiveness as the remaining sources of disutility are increasingly tenacious ones. If our influence is still felt at that point, it&#x2019;ll rapidly become less important, something that does not happen (and maybe even the opposite<sup><a href=\"#fn-increased-marginal-utility\">4</a></sup>) in the case of interventions that try to dampen the exacerbation of a problem. So if I have the chance to affect some trajectory by 1&#xB0; in a suffering-reducing direction, then I&#x2019;d rather affect an upward trajectory than a downward one, one that afterwards will at most become constant.<sup><a href=\"#fn-slight-downward-trajectory\">5</a></sup></p>\n<p>Some EAs have complained that they set out to make things better and now they&#x2019;re just trying to prevent them from getting much worse. But perhaps that&#x2019;s just the more impactful&#xA0;strategy.</p>\n<h3>Urgency</h3>\n<p>I&#x2019;ve often seen urgency considered, but not as part of the <span>INT</span> framework. I think it is a heuristic of tractability. When there is an event that is important to prevent, and the event is of such a nature that preventing it is all-important but there&#x2019;s nothing left to do if and once it happens, then all the leverage we have over the value of the whole future is condensed into the time leading up to the potential&#xA0;event.</p>\n<p>Survival analysis is relevant to this problem, because there are two cases, one where the event happens and then nothing (e.g., some suffering-intense singleton emerges and continues throughout the future &#x2013; <a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/s-risks-talk-eag-boston-2017/\">a suffering risk or s-risk</a>) and one where the event doesn&#x2019;t happen but may, as a result, still happen just a little&#xA0;later.</p>\n<p>There is some <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_function\">survival function</a> that describes our chances of survival beyond some point in time. It may be some form of exponential decay function. These have a mean, the expected survival duration, which may serve as a better point for comparisons of urgency than the earliest catastrophic&#xA0;event.</p>\n<p>If we wait with preventing catastrophes for so long that at the time when we do start to work on them the duration of the future that we can expect to influence is longer than the duration of the future we can expect to survive for, then it seems to me that we waited for too long. Conversely, if the expected end of our influence is earlier than our demise, it might be better to first focus on either more urgent causes or causes that don&#x2019;t have such a strong event character. But first we&#x2019;ll need to learn more about the likely shape of the decay function of our&#xA0;influence.</p>\n<div>\n<p>Further&#xA0;Research</p>\n<p>It would also be interesting to investigate whether we can convert the survival function for an s-risk-type of catastrophe<sup><a href=\"#fn-s-risks\">6</a></sup> into an expected suffering distribution, which we could then compare against expected suffering distributions from suffering risks that don&#x2019;t have event character. The process may be akin to multiplying the failure rate with the suffering in the case of the catastrophe, but since the failure rate is not a probability distribution, I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s quite that&#xA0;easy.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Interventions</h2>\n<p>Some of my considerations for comparing interventions are less well established than the scale, tractability, neglectedness framework for problems. Michael Dickens proposed a tentative <a href=\"/ea/yp/evaluation_frameworks_or_when_importance/\">framework</a> for assessing the effectiveness of interventions, but it is somewhat dependent on the presence of feedback loops. Apart from that, however, it makes the important contribution of considering the strength of the evidence in addition to what the evidence says about the expected marginal&#xA0;impact.</p>\n<p>I will propose a few heuristics other than historical impact for evaluating interventions. In each case it would be valuable to not only count the heuristic as satisfied or not but also multiply in once confidence with that verdict. Michael Dickens, for example, generated likely <a href=\"/ea/ws/on_priors/\">background distributions</a> of intervention cost-effectiveness to adjust his confidence in any particular estimate&#xA0;accordingly.</p>\n<h3>Feedback&#xA0;Loops</h3>\n<p>Confusingly, I&#x2019;m listing feedback loops as one of the heuristics. But I don&#x2019;t mean it in the sense that we should necessarily draw on historical evidence when evaluating the cost-effectiveness of an intervention (we should do so whenever possible of course) but that the presence of feedback loops that are short enough will be very valuable for the people running the intervention. So if there&#x2019;s a chance that they can draw on them, it&#x2019;s a big plus for the intervention enabling iterative improvements and reduced risks of updating around aimlessly on mere&#xA0;noise.</p>\n<h4>Good&#xA0;Proxies</h4>\n<p>We can almost never measure the outcomes we care about most directly but almost always have to make do with proxies, so the reliability of these proxies is an important&#xA0;consideration.</p>\n<h3>Durability</h3>\n<p>There are two failure modes here: the desired change may be reversed at some point in the future or it may have eventually happened anyway. For example, <a href=\"/ea/xp/lessons_from_the_history_of_animal_rights/\">vegan and vegetarian societies have not been stable in the past</a> or valuable research may get done in academia only a little later than at an <span>EA</span>-funded institute.<sup><a href=\"#fn-cooperatively-waiting-for-research\">7</a></sup> Another failure mode for many interventions is that some form of singleton may take control of all of the future so that we can influence the future only by proxy through influencing what singleton&#xA0;emerges.</p>\n<p>I can see three possible futures at the moment: (1) the emergence of a singleton, a wildcard for now, (2) complete annihilation of sentient or just intelligent life, or (3) space colonization. I&#x2019;ll mention in the following why I&#x2019;m conflating some other scenarios into these three. (This is heavily informed by Lukas Gloor&#x2019;s &#x201C;<a href=\"/ea/1k4/draft_cause_prioritization_for_downsidefocused/\">Cause Prioritization for Downside-Focused Value Systems</a>.&#x201D;)</p>\n<h4>Singleton</h4>\n<p>I&#x2019;ve heard opinions that implied that a permanent singleton is possible and others that leaned toward thinking that value preservation under self-improvement is so hard that value drift is inevitable. Perhaps this path may enable us to create a wonderful populated utopia or attempts at it might lead to &#x201C;<a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/cause-prioritization-downside-focused-value-systems/\">near misses [that] end particularly badly</a>.&#x201D; Improving our strategy for preparing for this future seems very valuable to&#xA0;me.</p>\n<p>A seeming singleton that turns out unstable after a while may be as deleterious for our ability to influence the future via other means than the singleton itself as an actual (permanent) singleton. Artificial general intelligence (<span>AGI</span>) may turn any sufficiently technologically advanced state that is not a singleton into a distractor state, in which case many of my thoughts in this text are moot. So this case is crucial to&#xA0;consider.</p>\n<h4>Extinction</h4>\n<p>In the cases of human extinction or extinction of all life, it would be interesting to estimate the expected time it&#x2019;ll take for another at least similarly intelligent species to emerge. <a href=\"/ea/1lf/paper_surviving_global_risks_through_the/\">Turchin and Denkenberger</a> have attempted this, yielding a result of something to the order of 100 million years. Such a long delay may significantly reduce the maximal disvalue (and also value, for less suffering-focussed value systems) of space colonization because resources will be more thinly spread (time-consuming to reach) throughout the greatly expanded universe and some other factors.<sup><a href=\"#fn-long-delays\">8</a></sup> However, space colonization may still happen relatively quickly if there are more species within our reachable universe who are also just some millenia away from starting to colonize space.<sup><a href=\"#fn-models-of-galactic-spreading\">9</a></sup></p>\n<p>But <a href=\"/ea/1k4/draft_cause_prioritization_for_downsidefocused/\">Lukas Gloor thinks</a> &#x201C;that large-scale catastrophes related to biorisk or nuclear war are quite likely (~80&#x2013;90%) to merely delay space colonization in expectation,&#x201D; with <span>AGI</span> misalignment and nanotechnology posing risks of a different category.<sup><a href=\"#fn-recovery-after-catastrophe\">10</a></sup> So a wide range of seeming extinction risks may allow our civilization to recover eventually, at which point the future will still hold these three&#xA0;options.</p>\n<h4>Space&#xA0;Colonization</h4>\n<p>Even if this repeats many times, it is likely that eventually one of these civilizations will either go completely extinct, form a singleton, or colonize space. The third option would eliminate many classes of extinction risks, the ones that are only as severe as they are because we&#x2019;re physically clustered on only one planet. Extinction risks that only depend on communication will remain for much&#xA0;longer.</p>\n<p>Risks from artificial intelligence will probably only depend on communication<sup><a href=\"#fn-ai-and-communication\">11</a></sup> so that it will have to turn out that artificial intelligence can be controlled permanently for space colonization to happen. This surely makes this scenario less likely than the previous two. (Or more precisely, though such precise language may imply a level of confidence I don&#x2019;t have, less than one third of the probability mass of the future may fall on this scenario.) Perhaps, though, we have a greater chance to influence the outcome or influencing it may require different skill sets than influencing artificial&#xA0;intelligence.</p>\n<p>But while humans may look out for one another, we have a worse track when it comes to those who are slightly outside our culture (or involved in it only in a unidirectional way where they can&#x2019;t make demands of their own in &#x201C;trades&#x201D; with them). <a href=\"https://sentience-politics.org/files/Dello-Iacovo-On-terraforming-wild-animal-suffering-and-the-far-future.pdf\">Michael Della-Iacovo</a> considers that insects may be spread to other planets (or human habitats in space) as a food source or even by accident. Eventually, farmed animals may follow, and they may return to being wild animals even when animal farming becomes obsolete due to such technologies as cultured meat. People may even spread wild animals for aesthetic reasons. Finally, the expected capacity for disutility of bacteria may be small, but large numbers of them play vital roles in some proposed strategies for terraforming&#xA0;planets.</p>\n<p>So the graphs in &#x201C;Upward Trajectories&#x201D; are inaccurate in the important way that suffering is likely to expand spherically as some cubic polynomial of the radius from our solar system &#x2013; not linearly.<sup><a href=\"#fn-cubic-spreading\">12</a></sup></p>\n<p>If we want to influence a future of space colonization positively, then it is all-important to make sure that our influence survives to the start of the space colonization era. (I will qualify this further in &#x201C;Reaching the Next Solar System&#x201D; below.) Then, longer survival of the influence becomes rapidly less important: Communities will likely cluster because of the lightspeed limit on communication latency,<sup><a href=\"#fn-faster-than-light\">13</a></sup> and if one of these communities loses our influence or would&#x2019;ve reaped its benefits even without us, it&#x2019;ll carry this disvalue or opportunity cost outward only into an increasingly narrow cone of uncolonized&#xA0;space.</p>\n<h3>Strategic&#xA0;Robustness</h3>\n<p>I specify that I mean <em>strategic</em> robustness because I&#x2019;ll mention something that I&#x2019;ll refer to as <em>ethical</em> robustness later, but this strategic robustness is just what others mean when they just say &#x201C;<a href=\"http://www.stafforini.com/blog/bostrom/\">robustness</a>.&#x201D; Strategic robustness unfortunately overlaps with what I called durability, but I try to disentangle it by using <em>robust</em> to refer to strategies that are beneficial across many different possible futures while I use <em>durable</em> to refer to strategies that have a chance to survive until we colonize space, if it should come to that. Insofar as the second is included in the first, it is a small (but important) part of the concept, so I hope not to double-count too&#xA0;much.</p>\n<h4>Fundamentality</h4>\n<p>In <a href=\"https://claviger.net/the-bulk-of-the-impact-iceberg.html\">The Bulk of the Impact Iceberg</a>, I argue that any interventions that observably produce the impact we care about rest on a foundation of endless amounts of preparatory work that is often forgotten by the time the impact gets generated by the final brick intervention. Some of this preparatory work may not get done automatically. This suggests that highly effective final brick interventions are few compared to equally or more effective preparatory&#xA0;interventions.</p>\n<p>A particularly interesting question is here whether there are heuristics for determining where the most important bottlenecks are in these trees of preparatory work because that is where we should invest most heavily. Studying advertisement may be helpful for noticing and testing such heuristics. (More on that in the abovelinked&#xA0;article.)</p>\n<p>I particularly highlight (and use as one such heuristic for now) research as a highly effective interventions, because, if it is done right and studies something that is sufficiently plausible, it is valuable whether it is successful or seemingly&#xA0;fails.</p>\n<h4>Value of&#xA0;Information</h4>\n<p>Feedback loops generate valuable information to improve an intervention incrementally. In this context of robustness, however, I&#x2019;m referring to information that is generated that doesn&#x2019;t only benefit the very intervention that generates it but is more widely beneficial. People working in the area of <a href=\"https://claviger.net/cause-area-human-rights-in-north-korea.html\">human rights in North Korea</a>, for example, may not be working on the most large-scale problem there is, and tractability and neglectedness may not make up for that, but they may gain skills in influencing politics and gain insights into how to avoid similar nigh-singletons as North Korea in the&#xA0;future.</p>\n<h4>Instrumental&#xA0;Convergence</h4>\n<p>Anything that we have already determined to be instrumentally convergent &#x2013; i.e. something that a wide range of agents are likely to do no matter their ultimate goals &#x2013; is convergent for reasons of its robustness. So all else equal, an intervention toward a convergent goal is a robust intervention. Gathering, knowledge, intelligence, and power are examples of such robust capacity&#xA0;building.</p>\n<h4>Option&#xA0;Value</h4>\n<p>Things that destroy option value are bad (all else&#xA0;equal):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>If you work on some intervention for a decade and then find that it is not the best investment of your time, it&#x2019;s best if the work still helped you build transferable skills and contacts, which you&#x2019;ll continue to profit&#xA0;from.</li>\n<li>If you never defect against other value systems even when it would be useful to you, you don&#x2019;t lose the option to continue cooperate with them or to intensify your&#xA0;cooperation.</li>\n<li>If you remain <a href=\"/ea/18i/hardtoreverse_decisions_destroy_option_value/\">neutral or low-profile</a>, you retain the ability to cooperate with a wide range of agents and can <a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/MovementGrowth.pdf\">avoid controversy and opposition</a>.</li>\n<li>If you avoid making powerful enemies you can minimize risks to yourself or your organization. The individual or the organization are often points of particular fragility in an intervention so long as relatively few people are working on it or they are fairly concentrated. (The failure of an organization, be it for completely circumstantial reasons, may also discourage others from founding another similar&#xA0;organization.)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Relatedly, something that I like to call &#x201C;control&#x201D; is useful because it implies higher option value: If you can change course quickly and at a low cost you have more control than if you could do the same but at a somewhat higher cost or more&#xA0;slowly.</p>\n<h4>Backfiring</h4>\n<p>Finally, robustness is nil if the risk of very bad counterfactually significant outcomes is too&#xA0;high.</p>\n<h3>Counterfactual of&#xA0;Funding</h3>\n<p>Valuable work that is funded by money or time that would&#x2019;ve otherwise benefited almost as valuable work is not terribly valuable. Resource constraints are rarely so clear cut, so we may never know whether it was great, good, eh,<sup><a href=\"#fn-eh\">14</a></sup> or bad for <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2016/02/the-value-of-coordination/\">Rob Wiblin to switch to 80,000 Hours</a>, but if you can achieve the same thing whether you&#x2019;re funded by EAs or by a <span>VC</span>, then it&#x2019;ll likely make a big&#xA0;difference.</p>\n<h3>Supportability</h3>\n<p>Even a problem whose solution is tractable may have an intervention addressing it that is hard to support, e.g., because you&#x2019;d have to have a very particular skill set or the intervention is so far only a hypothetical&#xA0;one.</p>\n<h3>Cooperation</h3>\n<p>No two people have completely identical values, and often values are significantly different. Battling this out in a battle of force or wits has rather flat expected utility dependent on the actors relative strengths <a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/gains-from-trade-through-compromise/\">while cooperation lets them find Pareto-efficient points</a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Depending on the shape of the frontier, this can be an extremely important consideration even for a risk neutral agent with a single value system:\n<ul>\n<li>To use the example from the article linked above, a special deep ecologist may care equally about 8e6 species totalling <a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/how-many-wild-animals-are-there/\">2e18 individuals</a> or the same number of species totalling radically more individuals. If most of these individuals suffer badly enough throughout their lives, a suffering reducer may greatly prefer the relatively smaller number. A trade would be very valuable for the suffering reducer &#x2013; if they&#x2019;re roughly equally powerful, then many times more than a battle in&#xA0;expectation.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>But it is also very decisive for me because I empathize with many value systems, so I want to do the things that are good or neutral for all of them &#x2013; what I refer to as ethical&#xA0;robustness.</li>\n<li>Even if the frontier is such that the gains from trade are minor, a zero-sum game may look more like a battle than a race, so that time is irreversibly lost, time that could be used to avert suffering risks or preserve important suffering-reducing knowledge across existential&#xA0;catastrophes.</li>\n<li>More speculatively, insofar as our decisions can be correlated with those of sufficiently similar agents who yet have different moral goals, we can determine the results of the different instantiations of the decision algorithm that we share with them and <a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/multiverse-wide-cooperation-via-correlated-decision-making/\">thus get them to cooperate with our moral system too</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n<h4>Comparative&#xA0;Advantage</h4>\n<p>Agents with strong commitments to cooperation will still face hurdles to achieving that cooperation because they may not be able to communicate efficiently. They can apply heuristics such as <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2015/11/25/good-ventures-and-giving-now-vs-later/\">splitting their investments</a> (see the &#x201C;Coordination Issues&#x201D; section in the linked article) into shared projects equally or focussing on the issues that they know few others <em>can</em> focus on, so capitalizing on their comparative&#xA0;advantage.</p>\n<p>Altruists at government institutions or many foundations may face greater requirements to make strong cases for their investment decisions that they can point to later when something goes wrong or a project fails to avoid being blamed personally. Private donors or the Open Philanthropy Project can thus cooperate with the former group by supporting the types of projects that the former group can&#x2019;t support.<sup><a href=\"#fn-audience\">15</a></sup></p>\n<h2>Influencing the&#xA0;Future</h2>\n<p>The first space colonization mission is about to be launched but the team of meteorologists is split over whether the weather is suitable for the rocket launch. Eventually, the highest-ranking meteorologist decides that if their colleagues can&#x2019;t agree then the weather situation is too uncertain to permit the&#xA0;launch.</p>\n<p>A week later, the rocket launches, and it sets a precedent for others. Innovation accelerates, prices drop, and eventually humans expand beyond the solar system far out into the Milky Way launching new missions in all directions by the minute. And all the while they take with them bacteria, insects, and many larger animals, may <a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/the-importance-of-wild-animal-suffering/\">r-strategists</a> among them. Unbeknownst to everyone, though, the launch would&#x2019;ve been successful even the first&#xA0;time.</p>\n<h3>Simple Delay&#xA0;Model</h3>\n<p>What influence does the one-week delay have one millennium later?<sup><a href=\"#fn-millennia\">16</a></sup> Intuitively, I would think that is has close to no impact, but a very simple model is not enough to confirm that&#xA0;impression.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://claviger.net/images/cause-selection-2018/simple-delay-model.png\" alt=\"Simple delay model\"></p>\n<p>The chart assumes that I&#x2019;m the meteorologist and that I&#x2019;ve turned a world whose suffering would&#x2019;ve looked like the blue line, <em>t&#xB3;</em>, into the red-line world, <em>(t-1)&#xB3;</em>. The yellow line is the difference in suffering between the worlds: <em>3t&#xB2; - 3t + 1</em>. That&#x2019;s a ton, and rather than diminishing over time like my intuition intuited, it increases&#xA0;rapidly.</p>\n<p>What decreases rapidly, however, is the size of the difference relative to the suffering that increases even more rapidly &#x2013; the green dotted line: <em>(3t&#xB2; - 3t + 1) / (t - 1)&#xB3;</em>. So is it just this morally unimportant relative difference that caused my intuition to view our influence as something like an exponential decay function when really it will increase throughout the next millennia? Dan Ariely certainly thinks that we erroneously reason about money in relative rather than absolute terms, fretting about cents and dollars when buying sponges but lightly throwing around thousands of dollars when renovating a house or speculating on&#xA0;cryptocurrencies.</p>\n<h3>Cyclical&#xA0;Model</h3>\n<p>Or maybe the intuition is informed by cyclical&#xA0;developments.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://claviger.net/images/cause-selection-2018/cyclical-model.png\" alt=\"Cyclical model\"></p>\n<p>Some overwhelming outside force may limit our potential absolutely at some point in time and force us back, and from that point onward, the suffering trajectory would only be conditional on the overwhelming force rather than our influence from the&#xA0;past.</p>\n<p>Seasons, winter in particular, are an obvious example of cyclical forces like that, but in the context of space colonization, I can&#x2019;t think of reason for it just yet &#x2013; especially once several solar systems have been colonized with decades of communication delay between them and probably no exchange in commodities given how much longer they would have to&#xA0;travel.</p>\n<h3>Progress Vacuum&#xA0;Model</h3>\n<p>But what about correlated forces rather than mysterious overwhelming outside&#xA0;forces?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://claviger.net/images/cause-selection-2018/progress-vacuum-model.png\" alt=\"Progress vacuum model\"></p>\n<p>Perhaps that week of delay saw one week of typical progress in charting space, searching for exoplanets, and advancing technology, so that the delay created one more week of &#x201C;progress vacuum,&#x201D; which eventually backfired by speeding up progress beyond the slope of the trajectory of the counterfactual&#xA0;world.</p>\n<p>But the graph above is probably an exaggeration. When you reduce the supply by slowing some production process down, the demand reacts to that in complex ways due to various threshold effects, and the resulting cumulative elasticity factor is just that, a factor, a linear polynomial. If our influence is a quadratic polynomial, as surmised in the first diagram, then multiplying it with a small linear polynomial is not going to have a significant negative impact in the long&#xA0;term.</p>\n<h3>Threshold&#xA0;Model</h3>\n<p>But might we face more mighty&#xA0;thresholds?</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://claviger.net/images/cause-selection-2018/threshold-model.png\" alt=\"Threshold model\"></p>\n<p>Now that&#x2019;s one mighty threshold right there! Once we&#x2019;re spread throughout space, it becomes harder to think of thresholds like that because it has to have an expected impact that is at least commensurate to a quadratic polynomial of time or radius. But so long as the radius is constant and we&#x2019;re still down to earth, a conference may be all that&#x2019;s needed: a research group may present some seminal paper at a conference &#x2013; delay them by one week, and they&#x2019;ll hurry up and have a typo more in the presentation, but they will still present their results to the world at the same&#xA0;moment.</p>\n<p>In conclusion, I think, based on just these rough considerations, that the cyclical model will continue to lose relevance but that the correlated speed-up (or supply/demand elasticity) model and the threshold model &#x2013; the first probably just a smoothed out version of the second &#x2013; will continue to be highly relevant for as long as we&#x2019;re still in one solar system or even on one&#xA0;planet.</p>\n<h3>Improvements vs.&#xA0;Delays</h3>\n<p>Intentionally delaying things that others care about is a bit uncooperative. The intervention that I&#x2019;m most excited about at the moment, making space colonization more humane for nonhumans, would instead aim to reduce the suffering footprint space colonization without interfering with its rate, so for example 0.9<em>t</em>&#xB3; instead of (<em>t</em>-1)&#xB3;. The difference to the counterfactual is now a cubic polynomial&#xA0;itself!</p>\n<p>For short time scales, the delay approach is still&#xA0;ahead:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://claviger.net/images/cause-selection-2018/improvement-vs-delay-short-term.png\" alt=\"Improvement vs. delay (short term)\"></p>\n<p>But then the cubic polynomial of the improvement approach of course quickly catches&#xA0;up:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://claviger.net/images/cause-selection-2018/improvement-vs-delay-long-term.png\" alt=\"Improvement vs. delay (long term)\"></p>\n<p>Now how can my intuition that impact decays still be true when we&#x2019;re dealing with a polynomial that is yet another degree&#xA0;higher?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Thresholds would have to look different than papers presented at conferences to limit out impact in this&#xA0;scenario.</li>\n<li>A progress vacuum is also not as straightforward. But if we put in a lot of work to advance a technology for making space habitable that minimizes suffering and so make it the go-to technology by the time the exodus starts (see &#x201C;Humane Space Colonization&#x201D; below), we&#x2019;re establishing it through some degree of path dependence.\n<ol>\n<li>If it turns out that it wasn&#x2019;t the most efficient technology, the path dependence may not be enough to lock it in permanently &#x2013; just as it is imaginable that Colemak might eventually replace&#xA0;Qwerty.</li>\n<li>Or fundamental assumptions of the technology we locked in that way may cease to apply &#x2013; more comparable to how Neuralink might eventually replace&#xA0;Qwerty.</li>\n<li>But in either case, our impact may only degrade to delay levels, not to&#xA0;zero.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>But if our impact still decays and if the period until the cubic polynomial overtakes the quadratic one is suitable in length, then we might still be better off delaying. Perhaps there&#x2019;s potential for a moral trade here: We&#x2019;ll help you with your technological progress but in return you have to commit to long-term funding of our work to make it more&#xA0;humane.</p>\n<div>\n<p>Further&#xA0;Research</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What are the strongest risks to our impact with the improvement&#xA0;approach?</li>\n<li>Can we build some sort of technological obsolescence model off the idea that assumptions follow a tree structure where technologies closer to the root make fewer assumptions &#x2013; they are harder to invent but there are fewer ways to make them obsolete &#x2013; whereas the opposite is true for inventions closer to the leaves, and that in the shape of an exponential relationship, thus introducing a factor that can perhaps, in some way I haven&#x2019;t quite fleshed out, still explain my decay&#xA0;intuition?</li>\n<li>When r-strategists reproduce they might &quot;multiply&quot; exponentially within the Malthusian bounds. If we can hope to affect little of the future, this may be highly relevant. Even if not, might we be able exert greater force on the polynomial than a delay has by influencing the factor of the exponent of such exponential but bounded&#xA0;growth?</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n<h3>Observations</h3>\n<p>Which of these models might best fit any observations that we can already make?

A large company may be better positioned to get old than a small one, but there&#x2019;s probably not enough space for enough large companies so that they can have the same outliers that there are among small&#xA0;companies.</p>\n<p>Languages and cities still exert influences several millennia later, but because of the high probability that the oldest cities would&#x2019;ve been founded anyway in short intervals because of their geography, languages are probably the stronger example.

It may be interesting to weigh the factors that indicate either&#xA0;direction.</p>\n</div>\n<p>So we can perhaps hope for our influence to last between half a century and a couple thousand&#xA0;years.</p>\n<p>If we want our influence to reach other solar systems &#x2013; and we travel there in a waking state &#x2013; we have to travel these, let&#x2019;s say, 10 light years at the 100th to 1000th part of the speed of light. That&#x2019;s some 30&#x2013;300 times the 356,040 km/h that <a href=\"http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2016/7/nasa%E2%80%99s-juno-probe-recognised-by-guinness-world-records-as-fastest-ever-spacecraft\">Helios 2</a> reached, probably the fastest human-made object in space to date.<sup><a href=\"#fn-time-dilation\">25</a></sup> That doesn&#x2019;t seem&#xA0;unattainable.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, in a sleeping or suspended (in the case of emulations) state the distance doesn&#x2019;t matter. Such missions will probably be expensive, so they&#x2019;ll need to be funded by many stakeholders that will have particular interests and goals, such as harnessing the energy of another sun. They&#x2019;re more likely to fund a mission with suspended passengers who can&#x2019;t change the goals of the mission when the stakeholders can no longer&#xA0;intervene.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, that doesn&#x2019;t necessarily mean that the new ships will be launched soon and none of our influence will be lost during the travel. Stakeholders will aim to make a good trade-off between an earlier launch and higher speeds, because waiting for technological innovation in, say, propulsion systems may be worth it and result in an earlier arrival. So the launch may be delayed, and if earlier enterprises get their predictions wrong and innovation happens faster than they thought, then their ships may even be overtaken by later, more value-drifted&#xA0;ships.</p>\n<h3>Reaching the Next Solar&#xA0;System</h3>\n<p>The jump from colonizing our solar system (where communication is feasible) and colonizing others is huge: The <a href=\"https://www.universetoday.com/15585/diameter-of-the-solar-system/\">diameter of our solar system</a> is in the area of 0.001 light years &#x2013; around 9 light hours &#x2013; while the <a href=\"https://www.spaceanswers.com/deep-space/whats-the-nearest-solar-system-to-our-own/\">closest solar system</a>, around the star Epsilon Eridani, is 10.5 light years away and another one, around the star Gliese 876, full 15.3 light years. (Infeasibly far for light-speed communication with our solar system.) So the different levels of feasibility of communication mean that a range of existential risks will diminish much earlier than any reduction of risk from value&#xA0;drift.</p>\n<h2>Ideas for a&#xA0;Model</h2>\n<p>Maybe I&#x2019;ll find the time to create a quantitative model to trade off short-term-focused and long-term-focused activities in view of the scenario where space colonization either happens before any civilizational collapse occurs or where our influence survives the collapse or&#xA0;collapses.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://getguesstimate.com/\">Guesstimate</a> has the added benefit that the limit to 5,000 samples introduces a quantization that, incidentally, protects against Pascal&#x2019;s Mugging type of calculations unless you reload very often. That will make the conclusions we can draw from it more intuitive or intuitively&#xA0;correct.</p>\n<p>The model should take at least these factors into&#xA0;account:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Our colonization of space can probably be modeled as a spherical expansion at some fraction of the speed of light.\n<ol>\n<li>It might take into account that faster-than-light travel might be&#xA0;discovered.</li>\n<li>It should assume small fractions or otherwise take relativistic effects into&#xA0;account.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>It should take the expansion of space into account, which will put a limit on the maximum region of space that can be colonized &#x2013; less than the Hubble&#xA0;volume.</li>\n<li>It should consider the number and perhaps the differences in density of solar systems\n<ol>\n<li>Since a large fraction of our time will be spent in transit, it may also be important to investigate whether the transit would likely be spent in a suspended or sleep state<sup><a href=\"#fn-ems\">26</a></sup> that should preserve all properties of the civilization or in an active state where the civilization continues to&#xA0;evolve.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>If we assume that there&#x2019;s no faster-than-light communication, then civilizations will probably cluster or otherwise have little effect on each other. Solar systems may be a sensible choice for the expanse of such clusters because they also have an energy source.\n<ol>\n<li>Whole brain emulation seems to me (mostly from considerations in <em>Superintelligence</em>) more quickly achievable than large-scale space colonization, so between already-colonized regions of space, communication and travel will become similar concepts.\n<ol>\n<li>Emulation may also become possible through training models of yourself with&#xA0;Neuralink.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>It should include some sort of rate of decay of influence, perhaps modeled as a risk per time, resulting into a decay function such as <a href=\"http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ExponentialDecay.html\">exponential decay</a>. The following &#x201C;risks&#x201D; should contribute to it, but separately as I will argue below:\n<ol>\n<li>Decay due to destruction of the civilizational cluster.\n<ol>\n<li>Crucial so long as we&#x2019;re huddled together on earth, afterwards probably limited to planets more than to whole civilizational&#xA0;clusters.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Decay due to random &#x201C;value&#x201D; drift, but not limited to values\n<ol>\n<li>Likely to be relevant for whole civilizational clusters, so probably close to impossible to overcome for us&#xA0;today.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Decay (of our influence) due to independent, counterfactual discovery of our contribution.\n<ol>\n<li>Dito.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Priorities</h2>\n<p>I think it makes more sense for me to put effort into prioritizing between different broad &#x201C;classes of interventions&#x201D; than individual charities, because if the charities are at all competent, they&#x2019;re likely more competent than me. And within each cause area, I should just be able to ask the charities which one I should support, or else they&#x2019;d fail my cooperativeness criterion. (Except, I may not notice many&#xA0;defections.)</p>\n<p>Just this &#x201C;class of intervention&#x201D; is something they&#x2019;re probably somewhat locked in to, either by by-laws, comparative advantage through early specialization, or some feature of the team&#x2019;s ethical&#xA0;system.</p>\n<p>So below I try to make sometimes a bit artificial distinctions and then try to apply my heuristics in the form of pros and cons of the cause area and the class of interventions. When an intervention has more cross-cutting benefits, then this scheme breaks down quickly &#x2013; moral circle expansion, for example, can be beneficial in how it influences futures without singleton and in how it influences what singleton emerges, but the latter benefits are counted only in the &#x201C;influencing the singleton&#x201D; section. I think the usefulness of this section doesn&#x2019;t go much beyond a mere&#xA0;brainstorming.</p>\n<p>And note that it doesn&#x2019;t make sense to count the pros and cons below because their weights are vastly different or my confidences are vastly different or they&#x2019;re highly correlated or they&#x2019;re just questions or some combination of&#xA0;these.</p>\n<h3>Influencing the&#xA0;Singleton</h3>\n<p>My heuristics don&#x2019;t help much to evaluate this one until I have more clarity on how to convert a hazard function (failure rate) into an expected suffering distribution. I continue to see immense variance in this whole future scenario because of the wide range of different worlds we might get locked in&#xA0;to.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>&#xA0;</th>\n<th>Pro</th>\n<th>Con</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>\n<div>Problem</div>\n</th>\n<td>\n<dl>\n<dt>Scale or upward&#xA0;trajectories</dt>\n<dd>See <span>WASR</span> below.

They&#x2019;ll probably have a range of options, and will choose the one that is most feasible, cheap, or expedient.

So in order to increase the chances that the technology that gets used in the end and that perhaps sees some lock-in is the one that we think is most likely to minimize animal suffering, we need to invest into differential technological development such that at the time that the technology is needed by SpaceX and company, the one that is most feasible, cheap, and expedient coincides with the one that minimizes animal&#xA0;suffering.</p>\n<p>A social enterprise that aims to achieve this could be bootstrapped on the basis of vertical agriculture, greenhouse agriculture, and zero-waste housing technologies and then use its know-how and general capacity to research low-suffering technologies for making space&#xA0;habitable.</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>&#xA0;</th>\n<th>Pro</th>\n<th>Con</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>\n<div>Problem</div>\n</th>\n<td>\n<dl>\n<dt>Scale or upward&#xA0;trajectories</dt>\n<dd>See Wild Animal Suffering&#xA0;Research.</dd>\n<dt>Neglectedness</dt>\n<dd>No one is working on it specifically as far as I know.

My moral perspective is the result of a <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/01/moral-uncertainty-towards-a-solution.html\">moral parliament</a> (note that the article appears to be written from a realist perspective) that consists mostly of a type of two-level <a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/hedonistic-vs-preference-utilitarianism/\">preference utilitarianism</a> with some negative and classic utilitarian minorities. The result looks akin to a <a href=\"/ea/140/integrity_for_consequentialists/\">deontological decision procedure</a> and something like lexical threshold prioritarianism. My intuition is also that suffering <a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/experience.pdf\">scales</a><a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/how-the-simulation-argument-dampens-future-fanaticism#Many_copies_of_a_brain_dont_matter_much_more_than_one_copy\">linearly</a> with the number of beings suffering to the same degree.&#xA0;<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 2 in the text\" href=\"#fnref-antirealism\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When talking about the long term, I either mean millennia &#x2013; periods long enough that we can suffer existential catastrophes or start colonizing space &#x2013; or all of the future. Humans, as the currently most powerful species, are still compressed in one spot in the universe, so that I think that what we do now will matter more (might even matter greatly more if our influences can last long enough) for the rest of the future than what any similarly sized cluster of people will do once they have colonized enough of the surrounding universe that communication between the clusters becomes difficult.&#xA0;<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 3 in the text\" href=\"#fnref-clustering\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Just as problems will typically become harder to solve to the same degree the closer they are to being solved absolutely, so they will typically become easier to solve to the same degree the farther they are away from being solved absolutely.&#xA0;<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 4 in the text\" href=\"#fnref-increased-marginal-utility\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Or plausibly one with a downward trajectory that is still so far away from being solved that I don&#x2019;t expect any significant drops in marginal utility throughout a period that I can hope to affect. (More on that in the &quot;Model&quot; section below.)

But if the EA-funded institute does the interesting research first the non-EA researchers will probably research something uninteresting (again, from our perspective) in that time, so less interesting research will get done. This may at first seem uncooperative, and it&#x2019;ll probably pay to stay alert to cases where it is, but it is the observed preference of the non-EA researchers to research the interesting topic in question, so they pay no price for our gain.&#xA0;<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 7 in the text\" href=\"#fnref-cooperatively-waiting-for-research\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://foundational-research.org/cause-prioritization-downside-focused-value-systems/\">Lukas Gloor</a>: &#x201C;Any effects that near-extinction catastrophes have on delaying space colonization are largely negligible in the long run when compared to affecting the quality of a future with space colonization &#x2013; at least unless the delay becomes very long indeed (e.g. millions of years or longer).&#x201D;&#xA0;<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 8 in the text\" href=\"#fnref-long-delays\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I&#x2019;m still very much looking for models of intergalactic spreading that take into account lightspeed limits and cosmic expansion; trade-offs between expansion and more efficient usage of close space and resources (e.g., through a switch to silicon-based life); and trade (including moral trade) with other space-colonizing species.&#xA0;<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 9 in the text\" href=\"#fnref-models-of-galactic-spreading\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>From &#x201C;<a href=\"/ea/1k4/draft_cause_prioritization_for_downsidefocused/\">Cause Prioritization for Downside-Focused Value Systems</a>&#x201D;: &#x201C;This leaves us with the question of how likely a global catastrophe is to merely delay space colonization rather than preventing it. I have not thought about this in much detail, but after having talked to some people (especially at FHI) who have investigated it, I updated that rebuilding after a catastrophe seems quite likely. And while a civilizational collapse would set a precedent and reason to worry the second time around when civilization reaches technological maturity again, it would take an unlikely constellation of collapse factors to get stuck in a loop of recurrent collapse, rather than at some point escaping the setbacks and reaching a stable plateau (Bostrom, 2009), e.g. through space colonization. I would therefore say that large-scale catastrophes related to biorisk or nuclear war are quite likely (~80&#x2013;90%) to merely delay space colonization in expectation.[17] (With more uncertainty being not on the likelihood of recovery, but on whether some outlier-type catastrophes might directly lead to extinction.)&#x201D; See also footnote 17 in the original.&#xA0;<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 10 in the text\" href=\"#fnref-recovery-after-catastrophe\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Unless perhaps they need great amounts of resources, such as energy, or some other additional limiting factor.&#xA0;<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 11 in the text\" href=\"#fnref-ai-and-communication\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Space has three spatial dimensions and is, at the largest scale, filled with matter evenly. When our civilization expands into space, we&#x2019;ll always try to reach the resources that are closest and not yet claimed by others, so that there&#x2019;s no reason why we would expand only in one direction (at a sufficiently large scale). At the largest scale, we&#x2019;d get a volume of our civilization and thus suffering of &#xBE;&#xB7;&#x3C0;&#xB7;r&#xB3;, but first there are many irregularities that will lead to a much more complex (but still cubic) polynomial &#x2013; irregularities such as cultural differences between mostly isolated clusters of our civilization, perhaps evolutionary differences, irregularities in the density of solar systems and galaxies, etc.&#xA0;<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 12 in the text\" href=\"#fnref-cubic-spreading\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Faster-than-light communication or even travel would change my models significantly.&#xA0;<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 13 in the text\" href=\"#fnref-faster-than-light\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><code>&#xAF;\\_(&#x30C4;)_/&#xAF;</code>&#xA0;<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 14 in the text\" href=\"#fnref-eh\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I would guess that this article is mostly read by an audience of private donors and perhaps someone at the Open Philanthropy Project or another similar foundation, so I can gear it a little bit toward that audience.&#xA0;<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 15 in the text\" href=\"#fnref-audience\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A millennium is long enough that it seems unintuitive to me that a little delay at the beginning should have an effect at the end of it but it is short enough that the accessibility of marginal resources (solar systems and such) is not systematically lower at the end due to such effects as the expansion of space or increase in entropy.&#xA0;<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 16 in the text\" href=\"#fnref-millennia\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For example, ETGing for highly effective short-term-focused charities for 50 years of one&#x2019;s life.&#xA0;<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 17 in the text\" href=\"#fnref-etg-influence\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I&#x2019;ll refer to these as concepts or ideas (whichever is clearer in the context) or influences when I only mean the difference between their factual and counterfactual duration of existence.&#xA0;<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 18 in the text\" href=\"#fnref-concepts-and-ideas\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Databases of the application for and expiry of trademarks (such as the USPTO) and of companies themselves may provide enough data to try to fit a decay function to it.&#xA0;<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 19 in the text\" href=\"#fnref-uspto\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>In comparison to languages for example, a company either exists or doesn&#x2019;t, but Proto-Indo-European, albeit incomprehensible to us, still exerts some influence on languages today.&#xA0;<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 20 in the text\" href=\"#fnref-companies\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I hope that sentence is comprehensible even if I got the grammar wrong.&#xA0;<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 21 in the text\" href=\"#fnref-counterfactual-homonymy\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At least in the sense of &#x201C;more than average.&#x201D;&#xA0;<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 22 in the text\" href=\"#fnref-most\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Is this true?

It&#x2019;ll probably take a while longer to build up such capacity. MIRI seems to be popular at FRI, but it is also (finally) well-funded this year.

If we (people like me) had to still fight harder for our survival, we may not have had the resources (time, leisure, iodine, etc.) to become more altruistic in the first place. Just as our civilization gives us those resources, it also makes altruism cheaper through economies of scale, gains from trade, transport, communication, etc. If this civilization is destroyed and some people are just struggling to rebuild it, then (1) knowledge whose implementation is feasible today will be infeasible for a long time, throughout which it may get lost, and (2) those who can&#x2019;t themselves fight or bargain to be included, such as nonhuman animals, will (again) be left behind for the longest time. Neither approach, scientific knowledge or moral arguments, are likely to be enough. However, a technology that will continue to be feasible, will profit its operator as much or more than an alternative, and benefits the animals would be the most likely technology to survive.&#xA0;<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 29 in the text\" href=\"#fnref-durability-of-knowledge\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>See the paper <a href=\"/ea/1lf/paper_surviving_global_risks_through_the/\">Surviving global risks through the preservation of humanity&apos;s data on the Moon</a> by Turchin and Denkenberger.&#xA0;<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 30 in the text\" href=\"#fnref-to-the-moon\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>He&#x2019;s particularly worried about very bad outcomes from fanaticism for example about EA ideas when they are read at a time when people are less aware of biases or more prone to superstitious thinking. But if the probability of fanaticism is small compared to a failure of the texts to have any effect (let&#x2019;s call it a null result) but the outcome may be bad enough to offset that, then, without act-omission distinction, fanaticism doesn&#x2019;t seem clearly worse than simple failure by a factor of more than 1&#x2013;2 or so, while the probability of a null result seems orders of magnitude more likely to me.&#xA0;<a title=\"Jump back to footnote 31 in the text\" href=\"#fnref-fanaticism\">&#x21A9;</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>A test of that might be to ask people from many different backgrounds and cultures to summarize such texts, preferably people who don&#x2019;t know enough of the culture of the author to adjust for the difference.

Some background:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>I first heard about effective altruism when professor Singer gave a talk on it at my university a few years ago while I was an undergrad. I was intrigued by the idea. At the time, I had already decided that I would donate the vast majority of my future income to charity because I thought that preventing and/or alleviating the&#xA0;intense suffering of others is a much better use of my money than spending it on personal luxuries. However, the idea of donating my money to <em>effective </em>charities was a new one to me. So, I considered effective altruism for some time, but soon I came to see a problem with it that to this day I cannot resolve. And so I am not an effective altruist (yet). </span></p>\n<p><span>Right now, my stance is that the problem I&apos;ve identified is a very real problem. However, given that so many intelligent people endorse effective altruism, there is a good chance I have gone wrong somewhere. I just can&#x2019;t see where. I&apos;m currently working on a donation plan and completing the plan requires assessing the merits of effective altruism. Thus, I would greatly appreciate your feedback.&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p><span>Below, I state the problem I see with effective altruism, some likely objections and my responses to those objections. </span></p>\n<p><span>Thanks in advance&#xA0;for reading!&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong><span>B. The problem I see with effective altruism: </span></strong></p>\n<p><span>Suppose we find ourselves in the following choice situation: With our last $10, we can either help Bob avoid an extremely painful disease by donating our $10 to a charity working in his area, or we can help Amy <em>and</em> Susie each avoid an equally painful disease by donating our $10 to a more effective charity working in their area, but we cannot help all three. Who&#xA0;should we help? </span></p>\n<p><span>Effective altruism would say that we should help the group consisting of Amy and Susie since that is the more effective use of our $10. Insofar as effective altruism says this, it effectively denies Bob (and anyone else in his place) any chance of being helped. But that seems counter to what reason and empathy would lead me to do.</span></p>\n<p><span>Yes, Susie and Amy are two people, and two is more than one, but were they to suffer (as would happen if we chose to help Bob), it is not like any one of them would suffer more than what Bob would otherwise suffer. Indeed, were Bob to suffer, he would suffer <em>no less</em> than either Amy or Susie. Susie&#x2019;s suffering would be felt by Susie alone. Amy&#x2019;s suffering would be felt by Amy alone. And neither of their suffering would be greater than Bob&#x2019;s suffering. So why simply help them over Bob rather than give all of them an equal chance of being&#xA0;helped by, say, tossing a coin? (footnote 1)</span></p>\n<p><span>Footnote 1: A philosopher named John Taurek first discussed this problem and proposed this solution in his paper &quot;Should the Numbers Count?&quot; (1977)&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p><span>&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>C. Some likely objections and my responses:</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span>Objection 1:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>One might reply that two instances of suffering is <em>morally worse</em> than one instance of the same kind of suffering and that we should prevent the morally worse case (e.g., the two instances of suffering), so we should help Amy and Susie. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>My response:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>I don&#x2019;t think two instances of suffering, spread across two people (e.g. Amy and Susie), is a morally worse case than one instance of the same kind of suffering had by one&#xA0;<em>other</em>&#xA0;person (e.g. Bob). I think these two cases are just as bad, morally speaking. Why&#x2019;s that? Well, first of all, what makes one case <em>morally worse</em> than another? Answer: Morally relevant factors (i.e. things of moral significance, things that matter). Ok, and what morally relevant factors are present here? Well, experience is certainly one - in particular the severe pain that either Bob would feel or Susie and Amy would each feel, if not helped (footnote 2). Ok. So we can say that a case in which Amy and Susie would each suffer said pain is <em>morally worse</em> than a case in which only Bob would suffer said pain just in case there would be more pain or greater pain in the former case than in the latter case (i.e. iff&#xA0;</span><span>Amy&#x2019;s pain and Susie&#x2019;s pain would together be&#xA0;</span><em>experientially worse</em><span>&#xA0;than Bob&#x2019;s pain.)</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Footnote 2: In my response to Objection 2, it will become clear that I think something else matters too: the identity of the sufferer. In other words, I don&apos;t just think suffering matters, I also think who suffers it matters. However, <em>unlike</em>&#xA0;the morally relevant factor of suffering, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s helpful for our understanding to understand&#xA0;this second morally relevant factor as having an effect on the moral worseness of a case, although one could understand it this way. Rather, I think its better for our understanding to accommodate its force via the denial that we should always prevent the morally worst case (i.e. the case involving the most suffering). If you find this result deeply unintuitive, then maybe its better for <em>your&#xA0;</em>understanding to understand this second morally relevant factor as having an effect on the moral worseness of a case, which allows you to say that what we should always do is prevent the morally worse case. In any case,&#xA0;ignore the morally relevant factor of identity&#xA0;for now as I haven&apos;t even argued for why it is morally relevant.&#xA0;</span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Here,&#xA0;it&apos;s helpful to keep in mind that <em>more/greater instances of pain&#xA0;</em>does not <em>necessarily </em>mean&#xA0;<em>more/greater pain. </em>For example,&#xA0;2 very minor headaches is more instances of pains than 1 major headache, but they need not involve more pain than a major headache (i.e., they need not be experientially worse than a major headache). Thus, while there would clearly be more <em>instances</em> of pain in the former case than in the latter case (i.e. 2 vs 1; Amy&apos;s <em>and</em> Susie&apos;s vs Bob&apos;s), that does not <em>necessarily</em> mean that there would be more pain.&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p><span>So the key question for us then is this: Are 2 instances of a given pain, spread across two people (e.g. Amy and Susie), <em>experientially worse</em> (i.e. do they involve more/greater pain) than one instance of the same pain had by one person (e.g. Bob)? If they are (call this thesis &#x201C;<em>Y</em>&#x201D;), then a case in which Amy and Susie would each suffer a given pain is <em>morally worse</em> than a case in which only Bob would suffer the given pain. If they aren&#x2019;t (call this thesis &#x201C;<em>N</em>&#x201D;), then the two cases are <em>morally just as bad</em>, in which case Objection 1 would fail, even if we agreed that we should prevent the morally worse case. </span></p>\n<p><span>Here&#x2019;s my argument against <em>Y</em>:</span></p>\n<p><span>Suppose that 5 instances of a certain minor headache, all experienced by one person, are experientially worse than a&#xA0;certain major headache experienced by one person. That is, suppose that any person in the world who has an accurate idea/appreciation of what 5 instances of this certain minor headache feels like and of what this certain major headache feels like would prefer to endure the major headache over the 5 minor headaches if put to the choice. Under this supposition, someone who holds <em>Y </em>must&#xA0;also hold that 5 minor headaches, <em>spread across 5 people</em>, are experientially worse than a major headache had by one person. Why? Because, at bottom, someone who holds <em>Y</em>&#xA0;must also hold that 5 minor headaches spread across 5 people are <em>experientially just as bad </em>as 5 minor headaches all had by one person.</span></p>\n<p><span>So let&apos;s assess whether&#xA0;</span><span>5 minor headaches, spread across 5 people, really&#xA0;</span><span>are experientially worse than a major headache had by one person.</span><span>&#xA0;Given the supposition above, c</span><span>onsider first&#xA0;<em>what makes&#xA0;</em>a <em>single</em> person who suffers 5 minor headaches experientially worse off than a person who suffers just 1 major headache, other things being equal.</span></p>\n<p><span>Well, imagine that we were this person who suffers 5 minor headaches. We suffer one minor headache one day, suffer another minor headache sometime after that, then another after that, etc. By the end of our 5th minor headache, we will have experienced what it&#x2019;s like to go through 5 minor headaches. After all, we went through 5 minor headaches! Note that the what-it&#x2019;s-like-of-going-through-5-headaches consists simply in the what-it&#x2019;s-like-of-going-through-the-first-minor-headache then the what-it&#x2019;s-like-of-going-through-the-second-minor-headache&#xA0; then the what-it&#x2019;s-like-of-going-through-the-third-minor-headache, etc. Importantly, the what-it&#x2019;s-like-of-going-through-5-headaches is <em>not&#xA0;</em>whatever we experience right after having our 5th headache (e.g. exhaustion that might set in after going through many headaches or some super painful headache that is the &quot;synthesis&quot; of the intensity of the past 5 minor headaches). It is&#xA0;<em>not</em> a singular/continuous feeling like the feeling we have when we&apos;re experiencing a normal pain episode. It is simply&#xA0;this:&#xA0;the what-it&#x2019;s-like of going through one minor headache, then another (some time later), then another, then another, then another. Nothing more. Nothing less.</span></p>\n<p><span>Now, by the end of our 5th minor headache, we might have long forgotten about the first minor headache because, say, it happened so long ago. So, by the end of our 5th minor headache, we might not have an accurate appreciation of what it&#x2019;s like to go through 5 minor headaches even though we in fact have experienced what it&#x2019;s like to go through 5 minor headaches. As a result, if someone asked us whether we&#x2019;ve been through more pain due to our minor headaches or more pain through a major headache that, say, we recently experienced, we would likely incorrectly answer the latter.</span></p>\n<p><span>But, if we did have an accurate appreciation of what it&#x2019;s like to go through 5 minor headaches, say, because we experienced all 5 minor headaches rather recently, then there will be a clear sense to us that going through them was experientially worse than the major headache. The 5 minor headaches would each be &#x201C;fresh in our mind&#x201D;, and thus the what-it&#x2019;s-like-of-going-through-5-minor-headaches would be &#x201C;fresh in our mind&#x201D;. And with that what-it&#x2019;s-like fresh in mind, it seems clear to us that it caused us more pain than the major headache did.</span></p>\n<p><span>Now, a headache being &#x201C;fresh in our mind&#x201D; does not mean that the headache needs to be so fresh that it is qualitatively the same as experiencing a real headache. Being fresh in our mind just means we have an accurate appreciation/idea of what it feels like, just as we have some accurate idea of what our favorite dish tastes like.</span></p>\n<p><span>Because we have appreciations of our past pains (to varying degrees of accuracy), we sometimes compare them and have a clear sense that one set of pains is worse than another. But it is not the comparison and the clear sense we have of one set of pains being worse than another that ultimately makes one set of pains worse than another. Rather, it is the other way around: it is the what-it&#x2019;s-like-of-having-5-minor-headaches that is worse than the what-it&#x2019;s-like-of-having-a-major-headache. And if we have an accurate appreciation of both what-it&#x2019;s-likes, then we will conclude the same. But, when we don&#x2019;t, then our own conclusions could be wrong, like in the example provided earlier of a forgotten minor headache.</span></p>\n<p><span>So, at the end of the day, what makes a person who has 5 minor headaches worse off than a person who has 1 major headache is the fact that he experienced the what-it&#x2019;s-like-of-going-through-5-minor-headaches.&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p><span>But, in the case where the 5 minor headaches are spread across 5 people, there is no longer the what-it&#x2019;s-like-of-going-through-5-minor-headaches because each of the 5 headaches is experienced by a different person. As a result, the only what-it&#x2019;s-like that is present is the what-it&#x2019;s-like-of-experiencing-one-minor-headache. Five different people each experience this what-it&#x2019;s-like, but no one experiences what-it&#x2019;s-like-of-going-through-5-minor-headaches. Moreover, the what-it&#x2019;s-like of each of the 5 people cannot be linked to form the what-it&#x2019;s-like-of-experiencing-5-minor-headaches because the 5 people are experientially independent beings.</span></p>\n<p><span>Now, it&apos;s clearly the case that the what-it&#x2019;s-like-of-going-through-1-minor-headache is not experientially worse than the what-it&#x2019;s-like-of-going-through-a-major-headache. Given what I said in the previous paragraph, therefore, there is nothing present that could be experientially worse than the what-it&#x2019;s-like-to-go-through-a-major-headache in the case where the 5 minor headaches are spread across 5 people. Therefore, 5 minor headaches, spread across 5 people, cannot be (and thus, is not) worse, experientially speaking, than one major headache.</span></p>\n<p><span>Indeed, five independent what-it&apos;s-likes-of-going-through-1-minor-headache is very different from&#xA0;</span><span>a single what-it&apos;s-like-of-going-through-5-minor-headaches</span><span>. And given a moment&apos;s reflection, one thing should be clear:&#xA0;</span><em>only</em><span>&#xA0;the&#xA0;latter what-it&apos;s-like can plausibly be experientially worse than a major headache.&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p><span>Thus, one should not treat 5 minor headaches spread across 5 people as being experientially just as bad as 5 minor headaches all had by 1 person. The latter is experientially worse than the former. The latter involves more/greater pain.&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p><span>We can thus make the following argument against <em>Y</em>:</span></p>\n<p><span>P1) If <em>Y </em>is true, then 5 minor headaches spread across 5 people&#xA0;is&#xA0;experientially just as bad&#xA0;</span><span>5 minor headaches all had by 1 person</span><span>.</span></p>\n<p><span>P2) But&#xA0;that is not the case (since&#xA0;</span><span>5 minor headaches all had by 1 person is&#xA0;</span><span>experientially worse than&#xA0;</span><span>5 minor headaches spread across 5 people).</span></p>\n<p><span>C) Therefore <em>Y</em> is false. </span><span>And therefore Objection 1 fails, even if&#xA0;it&apos;s granted that we should prevent the morally worse case.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong><span>Objection 1.1: (Improving it)</span></strong><br></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Objection 1.2:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span><span>One might&#xA0;reply that experience is a morally relevant factor, but when the amount of pain in each case is the same (i.e. when the cases are experientially just as bad), the number of people in each case also becomes a morally relevant factor. Since the case in which Amy and Susie would each suffer involves more people, therefore, it is still the morally worse case.&#xA0;</span></span></p>\n<p><strong><span>My response: </span></strong></p>\n<p><span>I will respond to this objection in my response to Objection 2. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Objection 1.3:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>One might&#xA0;reply that the number of people involved in each case&#xA0;is a morally relevant factor <em>in of itself&#xA0;</em>(i.e. completely independent of the amount of pain in each case). That is, one might say that the inherent moral&#xA0;relevance of the number of people involved in each case must be reconciled with the inherent moral relevance of the amount of pain in each case, and that therefore, in principle,&#xA0;a case in which many people would each suffer a relatively lesser pain can be morally worse than a case in which one other&#xA0;person would suffer a relatively greater pain, so long as there are enough people on the side of the many. For example, between helping a million people avoid depression or one other person avoid very severe depression, one might have the intuition that we should help the million, i.e. that a case in which a million people would suffer depression is morally worse.&#xA0;&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>My response:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>I don&#x2019;t deny that many people have this intuition, but I think this intuition is based on a failure to recognize and/or appreciate some important facts. In particular, I think that if you really kept in the forefront of your mind the fact that&#xA0;not&#xA0;one of the million would suffer worse than the one</span><span>, and the fact that the million of them together would not suffer&#xA0;worse<em>&#xA0;</em>than the one (assuming my response to Objection 1 succeeds), then your intuition would not be as it is (footnote 3). </span></p>\n<p><span>Nevertheless, you might still feel that the&#xA0;million people should still have a chance of being helped. I agree, but this is not because of the sheer number of them involved. Rather, it is because which individual suffers matters. (Please see my response to Objection 2.)</span></p>\n<p><span>Footnote 3: For those familiar with Derk Pereboom&#x2019;s position in the free will debate, he makes an analogous point. He doesn&#x2019;t think we have free will, but admits that many have the intuition that we do. But he points out that this is because we are generally not aware of the deterministic psychological/neurological/physical causes of our actions. But once we become aware of them &#x2013; once we have them in the forefront of our minds &#x2013; our intuition would <em>not</em> be that we are free. See pg 95 of &#x201C;Free Will, Agency, and Meaning in Life&#x201D; (Pereboom, 2014)</span></p>\n<p><span>&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Objection 2:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>One might reply that we should help Amy and Susie because either of their suffering neutralizes/cancels out Bob&#x2019;s suffering, leaving the other&#x2019;s suffering to carry the day in favor of helping them over Bob. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>My response:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>I don&#x2019;t think one person&#x2019;s suffering can neutralize/cancel out another person&#x2019;s suffering because <em>who </em>suffers&#xA0;matters. Which individual it is that suffers matters because it is <em>the sufferer</em> who bears the complete burden of the suffering. It is the&#xA0;<em>particular&#xA0;person who ends up suffering</em> that feels all the suffering. This is an obvious fact, but it is also a very significant fact when properly appreciated, and I don&#x2019;t think it is properly appreciated. </span></p>\n<p><span>Think about it. The particular person(s) who suffers has to bear everything. If we save Amy and Susie, it is<em>&#xA0;Bob</em> &#x2013; <em>that</em> <em>particular vantage point on the world </em>- who&#xA0;has to&#xA0;feel all of the suffering (which it bears remembering is suffering that would be <em>no less</em> painful than the suffering Amy and Susie would each otherwise endure). The same, of course, is true of each of Amy and Susie were we to save Bob.</span></p>\n<p><span>I fear that saying anymore might make the significance of the fact I&#x2019;m pointing to less clear. For those who appreciate the significance of what I&#x2019;m getting at, it should be clear that neither Amy&#x2019;s or Susie&#x2019;s suffering can be used to neutralize/cancel out Bob&#x2019;s suffering and <em>vice versa</em>. Yes, it&#x2019;s the same kind of suffering, but it&#x2019;s importantly different whether Amy and Susie each experiences it or Bob experiences it, because again, whoever experiences it is the one who has to bear all of it. </span></p>\n<p><span>Notice that this response to objection 2 is importantly compatible with empathizing with every<em>&#xA0;</em>individual involved (e.g., Amy, Susie&#xA0;<em>and</em> Bob). Indeed, to empathize with only select individuals is biased. Yet, it seems to me that many people are in fact likely to forget to empathize with the group containing the fewer number. Note that a</span><span>s I understand it, to empathize with someone is to imagine oneself in their shoes and to care about that imagined perspective.</span></p>\n<p><span>Also, notice&#xA0;that this response to objection 2 also deals with Objection 1.2&#xA0;since this response argues against (what seems to me) <span>the <em>only plausible way</em> in which</span> the number of people involved might be thought to be relevant when the amount of pain involved in each case is the same<em>:</em> when the amount of pain&#xA0;involved in each case is the same, it might be thought that one person&apos;s&#xA0;pain can neutralize or cancel out another person&apos;s pain, e.g. that the suffering Amy would feel can neutralize or cancel out the suffering Bob would feel, leaving only the suffering that Susie would feel left in play, and that therefore the case in which Amy and Susie would suffer is morally worse than the case in which Bob would suffer. But if my response to Objection 2&#xA0;is right, then this thought is wrong. </span></p>\n<p><span>Just to be clear, this is not to say that I think one person&#x2019;s suffering can not&#xA0;<em>balance</em> (or, in the case of greater suffering, <em>outweigh</em>) another person&#x2019;s equal (or lesser) suffering such that the reasonable and empathetic thing to do is to give the person who would face the greater suffering a higher chance of being helped. In fact, I think it <em>can</em>. But balancing is not the same as neutralizing/canceling out. Bob&#x2019;s suffering balances out Amy&#x2019;s suffering and it also independently balances out Susie&#x2019;s suffering <em>precisely </em>because Bob&#x2019;s suffering does not get neutralized/cancelled out by either of their suffering.<span>&#xA0; </span></span></p>\n<p><span>My own view is that we should give the&#xA0;person who would face the greater suffering<em>&#xA0;a higher chance of being saved in proportion to how much greater his suffering would be relative to the suffering that the other person(s) would each otherwise face. </em>We shouldn&apos;t automatically help him just because he would face a greater suffering if not helped.&#xA0;After all, who suffers matters, and this includes those who would be faced with the lesser suffering if not helped (footnote 4).</span></p>\n<p><span><span>Footnote 4:&#xA0;</span><span>My own view is slightly more complicated than this, but those details aren&apos;t important given the simple sorts of choice situations discussed in this essay.</span></span></p>\n<p><span>Going back to Objection 1.3, this then explains why I agree that we should still give those who would each suffer a less serious depression a chance of being helped, even though&#xA0;the one other person&#xA0;would suffer more if not saved. Importantly, the number of people who would each suffer the less serious depression is irrelevant. I would give them a chance of being saved whether they are&#xA0;2 persons or a million or a billion. </span><span>How high of a chance would I give them? In proportion to how&#xA0;their depression compares in&#xA0;suffering to the single person&#x2019;s severe depression. So, if it involves slightly less suffering, I would give them around 48% of being helped. If it involves a lot less suffering, then I would give them lot lower of a chance&#xA0;(footnote 5).</span></p>\n<p><span>Footnote 5: </span><span>Notice that with certain types of pain episodes, such as a torture episode vs a minor headache, there is such a big gap in&#xA0;amount of suffering between them that&#xA0;any clear-headed person in the world&#xA0;would rather endure <em>an infinite number of minor headaches</em> (i.e. live with very frequent minor headaches in an immortal life) than to endure the torture episode. This would explain why in a choice situation in which we can either save a person from torture or&#xA0;x number of persons from a minor headache (or 1 person from x minor headaches), we would just save the person who would be tortured rather than give the other(s) even the slightest chance of being helped. And I think this accords with our intuition well.</span></p>\n<p><span>&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>Objection 3:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>One might reply that from &#x201C;the perspective of the universe&#x201D; or &#x201C;moral perspective&#x201D; or &#x201C;objective perspective&#x201D;, either of their suffering neutralizes/cancels out Bob&#x2019;s suffering, leaving the other&#x2019;s suffering to carry the day&#xA0;in favor of helping them over Bob. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>My response:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>As I understand it, the perspective of the universe is the impartial or unbiased perspective where personal biases are excluded from consideration. As a result, such a perspective entails that we should give equal weight to equal suffering. For example, whereas I would give more weight to my own suffering than to the equal suffering of others&#xA0;</span><span>(due to the personal bias involved in my everyday personal perspective)</span><span>, if I took on the perspective of the universe, I would have to at least intellectually admit that their equal suffering matters the same amount as mine. Of course, it doesn&#x2019;t matter the same amount as mine from </span><em>my </em><span>perspective. It matters the same amount as mine from the perspective of the universe that I have taken on. We might say it matters the same amount as mine </span><em>period</em><span>. However, none of this entails that, from the perspective of the universe, which individual suffers doesn&#x2019;t matter &#x2013; that whether it is I who suffers X or someone else who suffers X doesn&#x2019;t matter. Clearly it does matter for the reason I gave earlier. Giving equal weight to equal suffering does </span><em>not</em><span> entail that who suffers said suffering doesn&#x2019;t matter. It is precisely because it matters that in a choice situation in which we can either save person A from suffering X or person B from suffering X we think we should flip a coin to give each an equal chance of being saved, rather than, say, choosing one of them to save on a whim. This is our way of acknowledging that A suffering is importantly different from B suffering -</span><span>&#xA0; </span><span>that who suffers matters.</span></p>\n<p><span>Even if I&apos;m technically wrong about what the perspective of the universe -&#xA0;<em>as understood by utilitarians&#xA0;</em>- amounts to, all that shows is that the perspective of the universe, so understood, is not the moral perspective. For who suffers matters (assuming my response to Objection 2 is correct), and so the moral perspective must be one from which this fact is acknowledged. Any perspective&#xA0;from which it isn&apos;t&#xA0;therefore cannot be the moral perspective.&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;<strong><span>&#xA0;</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span>D. Conclusion:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>I therefore think that according to reason and empathy, Bob should be accorded an equal chance to be helped (say via flipping a coin) as Amy and Susie. This conclusion holds regardless of the number of people that are added to Amy and Susie&#x2019;s group as long as the kind of suffering remains the same. So for example, if with a $X donation we can either help Bob avoid an extremely painful disease or a million other people from the same painful disease, but not all, reason and empathy would say to flip a coin &#x2013; a conclusion that is surely against effective altruism.</span></p>\n<p><strong><span>&#xA0;</span></strong></p>\n<p><strong><span>E. One final objection:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>One might say that this conclusion is too counter-intuitive to be correct, and that therefore something must have gone wrong in my reasoning, even though it may not be clear what that something is. </span></p>\n<p><strong><span>My response:</span></strong></p>\n<p><span>But is it<em> really</em> all that counter-intuitive when we bear in mind all that I have said? Importantly, let us bear in mind three facts:</span></p>\n<p><span>1) Were we to save the million people instead of Bob, Bob would suffer in a way <em>that is no less painful</em> than any one of the million others otherwise would. Indeed, he would suffer in a way that is <em>just as painful</em> as any one among the million. Conversely, were we to save Bob, no one among the million suffering would suffer in a way that is <em>more painful</em> than Bob would otherwise suffer. Indeed, the most any one of them would suffer <em>is the same</em> as what Bob would otherwise suffer. </span></p>\n<p><span>2) The suffering of the million would involve <em>no more pain</em> than the pain Bob would feel (assuming my response to&#xA0;Objection 1 is correct). That is, a million instances of the given painful disease, spread across a million people, would <em>not be&#xA0;experientially worse</em> - would not involve more pain or greater pain - than one instance of the same painful disease had by Bob. (Again, keep in mind that&#xA0;<em>more/greater&#xA0;instances of a pain</em>&#xA0;does not necessarily mean <em>more/greater pain</em>.)</span></p>\n<p><span>3) Were we to save the million and let Bob suffer, it is <em>he </em>&#x2013; not you, not me, and certainly not the million of others &#x2013; who has to bear that pain. It is <em>that particular person</em>, <em>that unique sentient perspective on the world</em> who has to bear it all. </span></p>\n<p><span>In such a choice situation, reason and empathy tells me to give him an equal chance to be saved. To just save the millions seems to me to completely neglect what Bob has to suffer, whereas my approach seems to neglect no one. </span></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Jeffhe"}}, {"_id": "E5uGZguvMhSuuga6M", "title": "Introducing Czech Association for Effective Altruism - history", "postedAt": "2018-03-12T22:01:49.556Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><span> This is a first part of two-part post about effective altruism in the Czech Republic, describing its history and reflections on what worked.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>I think it can be useful</span></p>\n<p><span>- to share experiences with building the EA community in a country where it did not exist (even if it is anecdotal evidence)</span></p>\n<p><span>- because we are working on several projects that have global or European ambitions, and we are happy to work together on them with you :)</span></p>\n<p><span>- because the perspective from Prague is sometimes different from Oxford or the Bay Area</span></p>\n<p><span>Beginnings</span></p>\n<p><span>The Czech Association for Effective Altruism (CZEA) was established relatively recently in the second half of 2016, by members of <a href=\"http://lesswrong.cz/\">the local LessWrong community</a>, but also with the participation of Radim Lacina from Oxford and Ale&#x161; Fl&#xED;dr from Harvard EA. Our first project was the organization of the <a href=\"http://www.eagxprague.org/\">EAGx Prague 2016</a> conference, with the main goal of increasing the number of effective altruists in the country.

The combination of &quot;important&quot; people and students seems to us to work better than something narrowly focused on students because it is more prestigious (it signals the importance of the effort in ways people intuitively evaluate). Media coverage in the form of a 30s spot in national TV or short articles in mainstream media is not good at explaining EA, but in a country where the EA has not existed, it is good for people who had met the EA ideas independently to notice and coordinate.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Another good idea that influenced CZEA was me going to <a href=\"https://www.eaglobal.org/events/eagx-oxford-2016/\">EAGx Oxford</a>. While online resources provide a firehose of information, it is often outdated, and attending a conference where the core of the movement is present is by far the most effective way to synchronize with what are the biggest priorities and current discussions. In our case this lead to more focus on research, less on giving. Another thing that is highly valuable are connections in the social network.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>I think both things are replicable: if we have the ambition to build a global, coordinated movement, a possible recommendation for central EA organizations could be that it would be a good idea to prioritize attendance of community leaders from countries where the movement is just emerging at global events, despite such groups not having an impressive list of successes. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>It would make sense to sponsor EAGx in countries where the community is small / emerging, but capable to organize a conference. Again, one big benefit is it is much easier to learn current thoughts from people than from the depths of literature, the second value is in synchronization of actions of people inclined toward EA. </span></p>\n<p><span>Large part of the benefit of conferences may be in improving the flows of </span><span>implicit </span><span>information.</span></p>\n<h2>&#xA0;</h2>\n<h2>2017</h2>\n<p><span>We wrote a rather ambitious <a href=\"https://translate.google.cz/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=cs&amp;u=http://efektivni-altruismus.cz/blog/strategie-spolku-pro-efektivn%25C3%25AD-altruismus-na-rok-2017/&amp;prev=search\">strategy</a> for 2017. We tried to think about the possible comparative advantages of effective altruists in the Czech Republic from the global perspective. EA prioritization considerations are often made from the point of view of a person living in Oxford, London, or Bay Area, and it seemed necessary to at least estimate what would be the result if we adapted the model for our circumstances.</span></p>\n<p><span>There are some real differences: the wage level in the Czech Republic is much lower than in central EA locations. To give an extreme example, a philosophy professor in Prague may earn as little as 18 000 usd per year. &#xA0;This means it is much less effective to follow any kind of &quot;earning to give&quot; strategies, take GWWC pledges, etc. So we deprioritized &quot;contributing money&quot;.</span></p>\n<p><span>On the other hand, due to low wages, relatively low income inequality and free study at public universities, the comparative advantage of the Czech Republic is cheap skilled labor, cheap research, development and various service works that can contribute to the global community. (E.g., the monthly salary of a PhD in maths working in research could be also around 15000 usd per year )</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Another area where our location may have a comparative advantage is organizing events - the costs of holding a conference or workshop with European reach in the Czech Republic are significantly lower than for example in Berlin or London. Prague has a good connection to many UK airports and is within 4-5 hours driving or taking a super-cheap bus from a major part of Germany. Actually, it would probably be cheaper to even run purely UK-focused events in Prague, as the airfare is lower than the difference in venue costs.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>What were the results of the strategy creation efforts?</span></p>\n<p><span>I would quote directly from the strategy document:</span></p>\n<h4>&#xA0;</h4>\n<h4><span>2017 Strategy</span></h4>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>In the Czech Republic, we are just at the beginning and we are not yet an established stable organization. In order to achieve the greatest possible positive impact, we need to ensure our future existence. Therefore, our primary priority is building community and to galvanize members. ... It is very valuable to build a community of people who are mutually supportive in their enthusiasm for effective altruism, even if they will not, for example, make any donations during the next 5 years.</span></p>\n<p><span>In addition to building a community of already involved effective altruists, it is also necessary to spread information about the philosophy of effective altruism toward people outside of the movement. We will produce information texts on effective altruism in Czech to inform and reduce barriers.</span></p>\n<p><span>Both of these areas are &quot;meta-activities&quot; focused mainly on the growth and promotion of the movement. We have also decided to supplement them with other activities that are focused on more direct help.</span></p>\n<p><span>We want to prove that we are serious about improving the world, and we do not just want to build a university debate club. From an outside point of view, we definitely do not want to look as an &quot;Effective Altruism Society, trying to help others as much as possible, whose only activity is its own promotion and expansion.&quot;</span></p>\n<p><span>However, looking at our actions on a long-term basis, it is much better to create an EA cell that will be active for the next 10 years, and every year it will contribute an effective charity equivalent of $50,000 than a cell that creates the equivalent of $ 100,000 in 2017 and then collapses. In the long run, therefore, in 2017, the meta-activity of building the movement is more important than direct aid.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>For the meta-activity of building a movement, however, projects focusing on more direct help will be instrumentally useful. Direct projects will give us:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>References and credibility (&quot;We are the Association for Effective Altruism: In 2017, we have succeeded in implementing successful specific projects X, Y, and Z.&quot;)</span></li>\n<li><span>Information (for example, &quot;We put a lot effort into the &#xA0;&quot;Adopt a chicken&quot; project and failed, but thanks to it we already know that people prefer pigs rather than chickens, so we can move our efforts further.&quot;)</span></li>\n<li><span>New skills (the more versatile, the better, the more useful they will be in future projects)</span></li>\n<li><span>Contacts</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>We chose two areas for more direct work: social impact assessment and research initiatives. As part of social impact assessment, we will focus on Czech non-profit and donors and will provide them with information on the methodology for measuring aid effectiveness and data-based selection of interventions. Research initiatives will inform the Czech academic environment about what research directions are potentially of great value for the future of humanity and support this research. Both of these direct projects provide, in addition to their direct goals, the ability to inform important groups of people about effective altruism. People engaging in non-profit work are often altruistically motivated, and it is, therefore, more appropriate for them to count others as an important priority in life. Collaboration with the academic community is again useful because of the general merits of properly targeted research.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>So, that was the strategy. What happened in practice?</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Results</span></p>\n<p><span>Impact assessment</span></p>\n<p><span>We started a social impact assessment project, called<a href=\"http://pomahej-efektivne.efektivni-altruismus.cz/\"> &quot;Help effectively&quot;</a>. It is probably worth explaining it was not created due to lack of understanding of EA ideas (like &quot;let&apos;s improve local charities!&quot;), but as a part of a larger communication strategy. There is much shorter inferential distance toward the idea of &quot;impact measurement&quot; or &#x201C;effective charity&#x201D; than toward let&apos;s say &#x201C;existential risk&#x201D; or &quot;AI safety&quot;, so the plan was to first promote the &quot;effectivity mindset&quot; and than ask people to use it on a more meta level. The project won support from the <a href=\"http://socialimpactaward.cz/\">Social Impact Awards incubator</a>, successfully passed the incubation, and started working on several impact evaluations.</span></p>\n<p><span>Even with the successful incubation and support from consultations from one of the &#x201C;big 4&#x201D; consultancies, the results were small on the object level and mixed on a meta level. After much market research, it turned it is problematic to find &quot;customers&quot; for impact measurement among &#xA0;NGOs, as they usually lack funding for such activity. So the second try was to find customers among the donors, who may be interested in improving the impact of their donations, or impact of the NGOs they support. This also didn&apos;t really catch up, or the organizations wanted services we didn&apos;t want to provide (like some &quot;turnkey impact assessment solution&quot;).</span></p>\n<p><span>On the meta level, the big problem was what people in NGOs would really love is confirmation that what they are doing is good and effective, and just needs some fine tuning. Often this would not be the case, from EA perspectives. This put the people working on the project in a conflict of interest: reasoning from EA principles, it would be usually effective for the &quot;customer&quot; to switch to something quite different, but this would not be an outcome of the audit they would like, or an outcome which would attract more customers. At the end, it seemed the project had dangerous potential to corrupt the reasoning of the people working on it.</span></p>\n<p><span>After the team leader of the project <a href=\"/ea/1l8/costbenefit_policy_prioritization_in_a_developed/\">left to work for the Copenhagen Consensus on &quot;Czech Priorities&quot; project</a>, the project basically froze, and we do not intend to actively promote it further. However, it seems even without doing much useful in direct work, it can have some longer term impact in directing the people who start minding impact in an EA way.</span></p>\n<p><span>The project also had some benefits on an instrumental level. The association has established links with a number of big foundations and donors who are interested in the subject of impact assessment. It has also been confirmed that it is a good &quot;introductory theme&quot; that brings new people to EA. On the other hand, the trajectory where the new member joins effective altruism, they are most attracted to impact measurement work and start working on it, seems particularly dangerous for a deeper understanding and alignment of such members. The project work also helped build local community skills and organizational competence.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Research initiatives</span></h3>\n<p><span>In the field of research steering, we originally planned to organize an AI safety workshop in the summer of 2017. We wanted the event to be held on academic grounds, and include speakers doing both AGI safety research and people from academia working on the more common near-term topics like adversarial ML. It turned out to be quite demanding to find the right academic partner - though we found some senior researchers interested in the subject, the usual problem was such people were too busy with managing their own grants, research groups, etc. Also when the opportunity to organize <a href=\"http://cfar.eu\">CFAR workshop in Europe</a>, described later, arose, I decided to switch the organizational effort toward CFAR.</span></p>\n<p><span>The second main endeavor was starting the &quot;Effective thesis&quot; project. I will describe <a href=\"http://www.EffectiveThesis.com\">EffectiveThesis.com</a> in more detail in the second article, so here is just the reasoning leading to its creation. There seems to be huge intellectual effort wasted in what people work on in their masters, bachelors or sometimes even PhD theses. Often the main point of the work is just getting the degree. If we can steer part of the good students toward EA aligned research topics, it may lead to interesting research being done at little cost. Apart from that, it can create big impact in three additional directions. </span></p>\n<p><span>1. It would connect the students to EA research institutions and would make hiring easier in the future, based on the experience and the produced thesis. </span></p>\n<p><span>2. Topic selection is often a critical moment in an academic career, shaping a researcher&apos;s long-term trajectory. Getting more people in the academia thinking about EA topics seems extremely valuable. </span></p>\n<p><span>3. As the students would seek advisors for their EA-aligned topics, the topics would get introduced to academia in a somewhat &quot;bottom-up approach&quot;.</span></p>\n<h3><span>CFAR</span></h3>\n<p><span>After meeting Duncan Sabien at EAGxOxford, we started communicating with CFAR staff about the possibility of bringing CFAR to Europe. This led to an agreement sometime in the spring of 2017 of running a CFAR workshop in Prague in October. The division of work was CFAR staff does all the teaching, and we do all the operations. Later, when the first workshop quickly filled up, we added one more.</span></p>\n<p><span>This was super-good for the CZEA. Along the way it led to a creation of strong, tightly cooperating team working on the workshop, having two workshops allowed the local organizers to attend and created many valuable social links.</span></p>\n<p><span>Feedback from the CFAR staff was also </span><a href=\"http://www.rationality.org/resources/updates/2017/fourth-quarter-cfar-newsletter\"><span>quite positive</span></a></p>\n<p><span>It is probably too early to early to evaluate impacts of the workshop, and CFAR will do that, but from what we know there are at least 7 workshop participants either directly working on AI safety or changing their careers toward AI safety/x-risk, another big part of participants is working in EA movement building.</span></p>\n<p><span>Indirect effect from the workshop was receiving <a href=\"/ea/166/donor_lottery_details/cwv\">a donation from Timothy Telleen-Lawton</a>, allowing partial professionalization of our organization in 2018.</span></p>\n<h3><span>General community building activities</span></h3>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>We also organized in average slightly more than 1 meetup or public lecture per months. While this lead to a number of people getting somewhat familiar with EA ideas, it seems it was hard to retain people who did not become involved in some of the projects. There seems to be some tension between content of meetups which is interesting for more experienced members and content good for novices. For 2018 we decided to split the meetups into &quot;public&quot; and &quot;internal&quot;, with the public-oriented more toward public and explaining concepts like prioritization, and the internal meetups more focused on the development of member competences, deeper knowledge, and connectedness.</span></p>\n<p><span>Structure</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>In the beginning, the structure of the association was basically flat - a group of nerds with Michal Pokorn&#xFD; as chairman of the legal entity.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>After Michal left, having been offered work for Google in Zurich, Jan Kle&#x148;ha became the second chairman. I think it was a major factor for the organization&apos;s success that Jan spent much of the year working for the association ca 0.5 FTE, and I spent about 0.3FTE organizing CFAR in the months before the workshops. It seems an organization consisting of ten volunteers working each for 0.1 FTE is considerably less efficient than seven volunteers working for 0.1 FTE and one coordinator 0.3 FTE. Even if the total workload is the same, the first group has much larger coordination overhead.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>After growing to about 30 members, we decided the flat structure was no longer scalable and created an elected Board. (If anybody is in the same situation, we suggest approval voting as the voting system).</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Our biggest mistake in structural growth was not securing enough funding - this led Jan Kle&#x148;ha to leave for Copenhagen Consensus in October (He was basically working for CZEA half-time almost without any income, and we realized too late this is not sustainable).</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>So we prioritized getting some funding, allowing someone to work on the community building and coordination. Fortunately, this was solved by the grant from Tim, who decided CZEA is worth supporting from funds he distributes as the result of the EA donor lottery.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Final remarks</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Building a movement on the level of a country is somewhat different than on the level of &quot;university group&quot;.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><span>Having a group of aspiring rationalists as the founding EA core helps.<br><br></span></li>\n<li><span>Interacting with CFAR helped us a lot.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Jan_Kulveit"}}, {"_id": "EAi24qrjxdzup3GjJ", "title": "Avoiding AI Races Through Self-Regulation", "postedAt": "2018-03-12T20:52:06.475Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>The first group to build artificial general intelligence or AGI stands to gain a significant strategic and market advantage over competitors, so companies, universities, militaries, and other actors have strong incentives to race to build AGI first.

We started organizing reading groups last semester. We tried to find relevant guides for that, but weren&apos;t able to find anything comprehensive in the EA community. Because of the need, we started to create a guide ourselves. It&apos;s a draft and would benefit from all kinds of comments. Here&apos;s the link to Google Docs:&#xA0;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/2p9kLgj\">http://bit.ly/2p9kLgj</a>. Everybody is welcome to make suggestions. Thank you for your time in advance!</p>\n<h1>What is a reading group?</h1>\n<p>Reading groups range from a few friends who meet regularly to talk about particular books that they have all read, often sharing a few bottles of wine to ease the discussion along, to more formal meetings, perhaps led by an academic, which explore literature in a more structured manner, rather like a seminar.</p>\n<p>Many reading group members find their reading becomes more rewarding, more focused, and that exchange of ideas with others can provide a whole new slant on a book. Readers in a rut will be introduced to books they would never have thought of reading, thanks to the recommendations of other group members.</p>\n<h1>What are the goals of a reading group?</h1>\n<p>The goals of effective altruism groups generally are to find and foster the development of people who are highly dedicated to, have a sophisticated understanding of, and have skills relevant to &#x2018;doing the most good&#x2019;, and to integrate these people into the broader effective altruism community.</p>\n<p>Along these general lines, there can be a variety of different goals for a reading group such as to have intellectual entertainment, improve philosophical or scientific understanding, and inspire actionable steps in readers&apos; lives to make the world a better place.</p>\n<h1>How to set up a reading group?</h1>\n<p>The easiest way is to start is with friends, family, colleagues and acquaintances. EA groups often already have done this to a lower or higher degree and therefore have a list of people to invite to these events. That is a better option, because these people are probably already interested in effective altruism. But by attracting people you don&#x2019;t know, you are likely to be introduced to books, authors, and ideas that are new to you as well reach new people to promote EA to.</p>\n<h1>How many members should a group have?</h1>\n<p>The average reading group has 6 to 10 members. This allows for a really good discussion, from several different points of view, and should allow for everyone to be able to make a contribution. Also the size won&#x2019;t inhibit shyer members.</p>\n<h1>Where to meet and when?</h1>\n<p>Some groups meet in local bookshops, in each other&#x2019;s homes, village halls, pubs, or university rooms. It has to be a venue that will be comfortable, accessible and relaxing for all members. If it is in people&#x2019;s homes, make sure there is enough room to accommodate everyone, and that everyone takes a turn with the hosting where possible, so that no one person has to cope with the catering and clearing up afterwards. Getting everyone together for an initial meeting is always difficult, but try and gauge what time of day, and day of the week suits the majority. Use that time for the first meeting, and then when you have that initial gathering you can discuss future dates and times.</p>\n<h1>Organizing the first and next meetings</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>How often do you want to meet? Monthly? Biweekly? Weekly?</li>\n<li>What time of day do people want to meet?</li>\n<li>What will your venue be?</li>\n<li>How long will you meet for? On average groups meet for an hour to an hour and a half.</li>\n<li>Do you want to have refreshments?</li>\n<li>Who will lead the discussion? It&#x2019;s often good to get members to take turns in doing this.</li>\n<li>What kind of group will you be? Philosophy? Science? Books or articles?</li>\n<li>Think about the books you would like to read in advance and if possible ask members what they&#x2019;d be most interested in to read.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Try to make the first meeting really relaxing and informal. You could use the ice breaker questions below, to get discussion flowing. It might be an idea to ask people to bring along their all time favorite book, or a book that they really can&#x2019;t get into to start of the conversation.</p>\n<h1>&#x201C;Ice breakers&#x201D; for the first meeting</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>What do you do for work or school?</li>\n<li>What are your general research and learning interests?</li>\n<li>How did you first hear about effective altruism?</li>\n<li>What effective altruism books have you read and what did you think of them?</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Leading discussions</h1>\n<p>There should be a moderator who leads discussions. He/she should be well-prepared with notes, open-ended questions, comments, etc. He/she can focus on definitions/concepts, arguments, evidence, examples, and main claims. He/she may also summarize what has been said and make conclusions based on that.</p>\n<p>The moderator should moderate enough but not too much. If he/she dominates too much, then others get to share their ideas less and probably feel less motivated to continue having discussions. If the moderator doesn&apos;t participate enough, the discussion might get too broad and lose focus or turn into an unproductive one.</p>\n<h1>How to read philosophy?</h1>\n<ol>\n<li>Approach the text with an open mind &#x2013; philosophy at its best is a fair-minded and fearless search for truth. Avoid making a judgment before you fully/fairly understand ideas and arguments. Try to maintain a neutral attitude, presuming that the author is neither right nor wrong. When you make a judgment, ask yourself what reasons you have for that judgment.</li>\n<li>Read actively and critically &#x2013; philosophical reading is intense, it cannot be rushed, it must be slow and deliberate. When you read philosophy, you are usually trying to follow the arguments closely. Ask yourself what key terms and passages mean, how the argument is structured, what the central thesis is, where the premises are, how key ideas are related, whether the main conclusion conflicts and compares with other propositions or philosophical writings. The whole point is to discover whether various claims are worthy of acceptance.&#xA0;</li>\n<li>Identify the conclusion first, then premises &#x2013; first find the main conclusion, then search for the premises that support that. There may be several arguments.</li>\n<li>Outline, paraphrase, or summarize the argument &#x2013; you can test your grasp of the argument by outlining, paraphrasing, or summarizing it.</li>\n<li>Evaluate the argument and formulate a tentative judgment &#x2013; understanding is the first step, the second step is to make an informed judgment. The judgment is your evaluation of the argument &#x2013; whether the conclusion follows from the premises and whether the premises are true.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>How to evaluate the impact of a reading group?</h1>\n<p>Use a feedback form after every session, after some sessions, or after reading an entire book. For example, these questions could be asked:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How much did you learn?</li>\n<li>How much did the discussion change your beliefs?</li>\n<li>Did the discussion generate ideas to implement in your life?</li>\n<li>What do you expect from the next discussions? What should the moderator have done better?</li>\n<li>How much did you enjoy your time?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In general, the impact can be evaluated according to how much participants enjoyed the discussions, how much they learned, and how much it influenced their beliefs and life.</p>\n<h1>What are the best practices for taking and using notes?</h1>\n<p>Laptop, tablet, smartphone, and printed paper can all be used for notes during the discussion, but each has its benefits and downsides. Laptop is larger and may disturb eye contact as well as increase the chance of multitasking, while a smartphone is smaller and better for communicating but makes it difficult to take notes during the discussion. What works then is to take notes in a notebook and transfer them to a computer later. Printed paper seems least convenient.</p>\n<h1>Guidelines for being benevolent and charitable in discussions</h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Be nice.</li>\n<li>Don&apos;t interrupt.</li>\n<li>Don&apos;t present objections as flat dismissals (leave open the possibility that there&apos;s a response).</li>\n<li>Don&apos;t be incredulous (not willing to believe).</li>\n<li>Don&apos;t roll your eyes, make faces, laugh at a participant, etc, especially to others on the side.</li>\n<li>Don&apos;t start side conversations parallel to the main discussion.</li>\n<li>Acknowledge your interlocutor&apos;s insights.</li>\n<li>Object to theses, don&apos;t object to people.</li>\n<li>You should attempt to re-express your target&#x2019;s position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, &#x201C;Thanks, I wish I&#x2019;d thought of putting it that way.&quot;</li>\n<li>You should list any points of agreement (especially if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).</li>\n<li>You should mention anything you have learned from your target. Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.</li>\n<li>Objections are fine, but it&apos;s also always OK to be constructive, building on a speaker&apos;s project or strengthening their position. Even objections can often be cast in a constructive way.</li>\n<li>Even when an objection is destructive with respect to a position, it often helps to find a positive insight suggested by the objection. If you find yourself thinking that the project is worthless and there is nothing to be learned from it, think twice before asking your question.</li>\n<li>It&apos;s OK to question the presuppositions of a project or an area, but discussions in which these questions dominate can be unhelpful.</li>\n<li>You don&apos;t need to keep pressing the same objection (individually or collectively) until the speaker says uncle.</li>\n<li>Remember that philosophy isn&apos;t a zero-sum game.</li>\n<li>Don&apos;t dominate the discussion (partial exception for the speaker here!).</li>\n<li>Try not to let your question (or your answer) run on forever.</li>\n<li>Acknowledge points made by previous questioners.</li>\n<li>It&apos;s OK to ask a question that you think may be unsophisticated or uninformed.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Sample discussion guide for Doing Good Better</h1>\n<p><strong>Introduction and chapter 1:</strong></p>\n<p>Quotes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#x201C;Randomized controlled trials are the gold-standard method of testing ideas in other sciences, and for decades pharmaceutical companies have used them to test new drugs. In fact, because it&#x2019;s so important not to sell people ineffective or harmful drugs, it&#x2019;s illegal to market a drug that hasn&#x2019;t gone through extensive randomized controlled trials. But before Kremer suggested it, the idea had never been applied to the development world.&#x201D;</li>\n<li>&#x201C;Effective altruism is about asking, &#x201C;How can I make the biggest difference I can?&#x201D; and using evidence and careful reasoning to try to find an answer. It takes a scientific approach to doing good. Just as science consists of the honest and impartial attempt to work out what&#x2019;s true, and a commitment to believe the truth whatever that turns out to be, effective altruism consists of the honest and impartial attempt to work out what&#x2019;s best for the world, and a commitment to do what&#x2019;s best, whatever that turns out to be.&#x201D;</li>\n<li>&#x201C;As I use the term, altruism simply means improving the lives of others. Many people believe that altruism should denote sacrifice, but if you can do good while maintaining a comfortable life for yourself, that&#x2019;s a bonus, and I&#x2019;m very happy to call that altruism. The second part is effectiveness, by which I mean doing the most good with whatever resources you have. Importantly, effective altruism is not just about making a difference, or doing some amount of good. It&#x2019;s about trying to make the most difference you can.&#x201D;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Why do we depend on intuitions so much when choosing charities? How can abstract and counter-intuitive charities be made emotionally appealing?</li>\n<li>Should philanthropy be self-sacrificing and is true altruism such that the person being altruistic doesn&apos;t get any benefits and suffers due to helping?</li>\n<li>What do you think how rich are you in the world?: https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/how-rich-am-i. What implications does it have?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Chapter 2:</strong></p>\n<p>Quotes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#x201C;There were so many, and they kept coming. Patients were taped with a 1, 2, or 3 on their foreheads: 1 meant treat now, 2 meant treat within twenty-four hours, and 3 meant irretrievable. The 3s were moved to the small hill by the roadside opposite the emergency room and left to die in as much comfort as could be mustered for them. They were covered with blankets to stay warm and given water and whatever morphine we had. The 1s were carried by stretcher to the emergency room or to the entrance area around it. The 2s were placed in groups behind the 1s. ... With so many casualties coming in, Orbinski knew he could not save everyone, and that meant he had to make tough choices: whom did he save, and whom did he leave to die?&#x201D;</li>\n<li>&#x201C;The idea behind the QALY is that there are two ways you can give a health benefit to someone. First, you can &#x201C;save someone&#x2019;s life. (I use quotes here because &#x201C;saving&#x201D; a life, of course, only ever means extending someone&#x2019;s life.) The second way to benefit someone is to improve the quality of their life during the time they are alive. Migraines don&#x2019;t kill people, but, as someone who occasionally suffers from them, I know that life is better without them.&#x201D;</li>\n<li>&#x201C;The difficulty of comparing different sorts of altruistic activity is therefore ultimately due to a lack of knowledge about what will happen as a result of that activity, or a lack of knowledge about how different activities translate into improvements to people&#x2019;s lives. It&#x2019;s not that different sorts of benefits are in principle incomparable.&#x201D;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Would anyone disagree that we need to set priorities when trying to do good?

The number of spots at medical school is fairly rigid, so if you decide not to go to medical school, someone else will take your place and become a doctor in your stead. Thus, by becoming a doctor, you&#x2019;re really just changing who works as a doctor, not adding to the overall amount of talent out there.&#x201D;</li>\n<li>&#x201C;Earning to give means exactly what it sounds like: rather than trying to maximize the direct impact you have with your job, you instead try to increase your earnings so you can donate more, improving people&#x2019;s lives through your giving rather than your day-to-day work.

How much does the charity spend on administration? How much is its CEO paid? What percentage of donations are put directly to the charity&#x2019;s main programs? This is the approach that Charity Navigator, the oldest and most popular charity evaluator, has taken for the last fifteen years. According to Charity Navigator, &#x201C;Savvy donors know that the financial health of a charity is a strong indicator of the charity&#x2019;s programmatic performance.&#x201D;&#x201D;</li>\n<li>&#x201C;Given the lessons of the previous chapters, however, we should already understand that this approach to evaluating a charity&#x2019;s effectiveness is seriously misguided. For starters, think about the logic behind this reasoning if you apply it to personal spending. Suppose you&#x2019;re deciding whether to buy a Mac or a PC. What factors would you consider? You&#x2019;d probably think about the design and usability of the two computers, the hardware, the software, and the price. You certainly wouldn&#x2019;t think about how much Apple and Microsoft each spend on administration, and you wouldn&#x2019;t think about how much their respective CEOs are paid. Why would you? As a consumer you only care about the product you get with the money you spend; details about the financials of the companies who make the products are almost always irrelevant. If Apple spent a lot of money to attract a more talented management team, you might even consider that a good sign that their products were the best on the market!&#x201D;</li>\n<li>&#x201C;This may have been true of the Against Malaria Foundation in 2013: GiveWell had named it its top-recommended organization in 2012, and it received a surge in donations totaling $10 million. They struggled to spend that money quickly, which suggested that additional donations to them wouldn&#x2019;t have the same effectiveness as previous donations, so GiveWell didn&#x2019;t recommend them in 2013. (They successfully increased their capacity in 2013, however, so GiveWell recommended them again in 2014.)&#x201D;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Have you donated before?

We assume that if people refused to buy goods from sweatshops, these factories would succumb to economic pressure and go out of business, in which case their employees would find better employment elsewhere. But that&#x2019;s not true. In developing countries, sweatshop jobs are the good jobs. The alternatives are typically worse, such as backbreaking, low-paid farm labor, scavenging, or unemployment.&#x201D;</li>\n<li>&#x201C;... if we&#x2019;re thinking about buying fair-trade ourselves, we need to ask how much we&#x2019;re actually benefitting people in poor countries by shelling out a few extra dollars for fair-trade versus regular coffee. The evidence suggests that the answer is &#x201C;disappointingly little.&#x201D;&#x201D;</li>\n<li>&#x201C;Sadly, many popular ways of reducing your greenhouse gas emissions are rather ineffective. One common recommendation is to turn off or shut down electronic devices when you&#x2019;re not using them, rather than keeping them on standby. However, this achieves very little compared to other things you could do: one hot bath adds more to your carbon footprint than leaving your phone charger plugged in for a whole year; even leaving on your TV (one of the worst offenders in terms of standby energy use) for a whole year contributes less to your carbon footprint than driving a car for just two hours.&#x201D;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are you persuaded that it&#x2019;s a bad idea to protest sweatshops? What about fair-trade? What kind of evidence persuades you one way or another?</li>\n<li>What do you think about ethical consumerism?

At the same time, the decision is high-stakes. Your choice of career is a choice about how to spend more than eighty thousand hours over the course of your life, which means it makes sense to invest a considerable amount of time in the decision. If you were to spend just 1 percent of your working time thinking about how to spend the other 99 percent, that would mean you&#x2019;d spend eight hundred hours, or twenty working weeks, on your career decision. I doubt many people spend this much time thinking about their careers, but it might be worth it.&#x201D;</li>\n<li>&#x201C;Finding a career that&#x2019;s the right &#x201C;fit&#x201D; for you is crucial to finding a career, but believing you must find some preordained &#x201C;passion&#x201D; and then pursue jobs that match it is all wrong. &#x2026; Should you pick a career by identifying your greatest interest, finding jobs that &#x201C;match&#x201D; that interest and pursuing them no matter what? On the basis of the evidence, the answer seems to be no.&#x201D;</li>\n<li>&#x201C;In general, we recommend people think of three primary routes by which they can have impact on the job. The first is through the labor you provide. This can be the work you do if you are employed by an effective organization, or the research you do if you are a researcher. The second is the money you can give. The third is the influence you can have on other people. In order to work out the total impact you can have, you should look at all three of these; whereas advice that solely focuses on the charity sector only looks at the first.&#x201D;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>How have you made career decisions in your life? Has it been different from what&#x2019;s recommended in this book?</li>\n<li>How important do you think personal passion is when choosing a career? But personal fit?</li>\n<li>What careers have the highest expected social impact? What about career capital?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Chapter 10:</strong></p>\n<p>Quotes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#x201C;Though foundations and social entrepreneurs often talk about trying to maximize their impact, they normally just focus on maximizing their impact within the cause or causes that they&#x2019;re personally passionate about (like poverty, or education, or climate change), rather than thinking strategically about which causes they should focus on. If we&#x2019;re really trying to do the most good we can, however, then we need to think carefully about cause selection. We&#x2019;ll be able to help more people to a greater degree within some cause areas than we will in others, which means that, in order to have the biggest impact we can, we have to think carefully about what causes we choose to focus on.&#x201D;</li>\n<li>&#x201C;...bear in mind that decisions about cause selection involve value judgments to an even greater degree than some of the other issues I&#x2019;ve covered in this book, so the conclusions you reach might be quite different from the ones I reach. Though effective altruism aims to take a scientific approach to doing good, it&#x2019;s not exactly physics: there is plenty of room for differences of opinion. This doesn&#x2019;t, however, make thinking rigorously about which cause one chooses to focus on any less important.&#x201D;</li>\n<li>&#x201C;On the framework I propose, you can compare causes by assessing them on how well they do on each of the following three dimensions: First, scale. What&#x2019;s the magnitude of this problem? How much does it affect lives in the short run and long run? Second, neglectedness. How many resources are already being dedicated to tackling this problem? How well allocated are the resources that are currently being dedicated to the problem? Is there reason to expect this problem can&#x2019;t be solved by markets or governments? Third, tractability. How easy is it to make progress on this problem, and how easy is it to tell if you&#x2019;re making progress? Do interventions within this cause exist, and how strong is the evidence behind those interventions? Do you expect to be able to discover new promising interventions within this cause?&#xA0;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Questions:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Do you think anyone could be motivated to pursue a cause that is most pressing even though they don&#x2019;t have personal interest in that?</li>\n<li>What causes do you think are most pressing?

Yet opportunities for individual donors to find high impact grant opportunities remain. In this post I review the recent history of AI safety organizations, speculate on the ways in which funding early AI safety organizations may have impacted today&#x2019;s AI safety landscape, and on this basis propose some heuristics for finding untapped funding opportunities:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Focus on which people you&#x2019;re bringing into the community</span></li>\n<li><span>Personal brands and platforms matter, and have accounted for some of the largest successes of the community</span></li>\n<li><span>Culture and intellectual environments matter</span></li>\n<li><span>Small amounts of funding today may move much larger amounts of funding in the future</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span>Introduction</span></h2>\n<p>For early AI safety organizations, funding was a major bottleneck. During the 2000-2010 period, large donors were sparse and, with few exceptions, not motivated to commit large amounts of capital to such esoteric causes<sup><a href=\"#ftnt1\">[1]</a></sup>. Small donors accounted for a substantial fraction of the budget of organizations such as SIAI<sup><a href=\"#ftnt2\">[2]</a></sup>, while others located themselves within universities. A private donor looking for funding opportunities at this time would quickly find multiple organizations with significant room for funding, and much of the work in making grants consisted in&#xA0;<span>comparing different funding opportunities to determine which would lead to greatest counterfactual impact.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Over the past few years that situation has changed. Multiple large grant-making organizations have identified AI safety as an important cause area,<sup><a href=\"#ftnt3\">[3]</a></sup>&#xA0;including the Open Philanthropy Project<sup><a href=\"#ftnt4\">[4]</a></sup>, the Future of Life Institute<sup><a href=\"#ftnt5\">[5]</a></sup>, the Berkeley Existential Risk Institute<sup><a href=\"#ftnt6\">[6]</a></sup>, and the EA Long Term Future Fund<sup><a href=\"#ftnt7\">[7]</a></sup>. While the amounts that each organization or individual hopes to deploy within AI safety is not public (or in many cases is not yet decided), it seems likely that the amount of&#xA0;<span>funding that would be deployed if there were many large, promising funding opportunities exceeds the room for more funding across currently existing AI safety organizations.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>This changes the nature of funding decisions, since in a world with more funding than projects, the decision to fund a project looks more like an evaluation of whether the project crosses some usefulness threshold, and less like a comparison between projects.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>In this post I propose some initially thoughts on how grant-makers might approach this changed funding landscape. Of particular relevance to me is opportunities available to a individual donors acting in the midst of multiple large foundations deploying significant amounts of capital.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Everything here should be should be interpreted as early thoughts on the topic, and I expect to update significantly based on feedback from the community.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Growth</span></h2>\n<p><span>If today&#x2019;s AI safety community is to have a meaningful effect on the overall development of AI then I believe it must at some point in the future grow significantly beyond its current size. By &#x201C;grow&#x201D; I mean an increase in either the number of people involved, or a spreading of ideas, culture, and public interest. There appears at present to be a vast amount of technical work to do, and an even greater amount of operational and engineer work must surely follow. In the long term, it seems to me that the total amount of work being done on AI safety in a given year must be non-trivial compared to the total amount of work being done on AI, yet at the moment these two fields are several orders of magnitude apart in terms of people and output. Since the AI field itself is currently growing quickly, it seems unlikely that the AI safety community will have a meaningful impact on the future development of AI if it never grows beyond its current size.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>This does not imply that the community should grow immediately or that it needs to grow quickly, only that it must&#xA0;<span>eventually</span><span>&#xA0;grow if it is to have a meaningful impact. Thankfully, the community looks to me to be well poised for significant growth over the coming years and decades. When making funding decisions, grant makers should therefore think carefully about how funding decisions flow through scenarios in which there is significant growth at some point in the future.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>If the community does grow significantly, then much of our raw output (research, outreach, policy proposals, and so on) will be in the future, where there are larger numbers of people doing direct work, and those people are better informed by what has or has not worked so far, have more information on how the overall AI landscape is evolving, and so on. For this reason we may have substantial&#xA0;<span>leverage</span><span>&#xA0;now, since small efforts today may be able to affect the work done by the future AI safety community: what its focus is, how clear its research agenda is, who is involved, and how it is perceived externally.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>I therefore think that much of the&#xA0;<span>impact</span><span>&#xA0;of funding decisions today flow through this larger future AI safety community: that is, either the community does not grow, and grants made today have little impact on the long term future of AI, or else the community does grow, and the impact of today&#x2019;s grants play out via their effects on the future where most of the total work is done.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Examples from recent history</span></h2>\n<p><span>If the impact of today&#x2019;s funding decisions mostly flow through tomorrow&#x2019;s AI safety community, then it may be helpful to understand how funding decisions made in the past have affected today&#x2019;s AI safety community. In this section I will give a brief rundown of the oldest organizations in this space, and some thoughts on how their actions have shaped today&#x2019;s AI safety community.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Unfortunately&#xA0;the task of reconstructing a detailed history of these organizations is a much larger project, so I&#x2019;m going to present here some very rough notes based on published timelines<sup><a href=\"#ftnt8\">[8]</a></sup><span>&#xA0;and on my own understanding of how these organizations evolved. If my reconstruction here is incorrect then I hope that this lens will still provide an intuition pump for thinking about how funding decisions made today may affect the future.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Some caveats:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>I am arbitrarily including everything up to 2010 as &#x201C;recent history&#x201D;</span></li>\n<li><span>I am trying to assess the ways in which the early forms of today&#x2019;s organizations affected the present landscape. I am not trying to assign positive or negative value to these effects.</span></li>\n<li><span>As always, it is very difficult to properly allocate counterfactual credit and this is just a first pass.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span>Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence</span></h3>\n<p>Singularity Institute was founded by Eliezer Yudkowsky in July 2000<sup><a href=\"#ftnt9\">[9]</a></sup>&#xA0;with the stated mission of &#x201C;creating a&#xA0;friendly, self-improving artificial intelligence&#x201D;.&#xA0;<span>In 2013 the organization was renamed to the Machine Intelligence Research Institute.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Here I list some of the work that SIAI engaged in during these years<span>&#xA0;and my best guess as to their effects on today&#x2019;s AI safety community.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Direct research</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span>It seems that some of the early Yudkowsky publications (pre-2012) convinced key individuals to take AI safety seriously.</span></li>\n<li>But today&#x2019;s AI safety literature does not seem to build directly on conceptual foundations laid by this early work.</li>\n<li><span>The main exception appears to be the work on decision theory, which does seem to trace its roots directly to technical work from this period.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Lesswrong</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Appears to have caused a substantial number of people to devote their careers to working on AI safety, and many more to become involved outside of full time work.</span></li>\n<li><span>The specific ideas written about in the sequences are clearly widely known, but it is unclear to me how much impact they have had on today&#x2019;s technical AI safety landscape.</span></li>\n<li><span>The culture created within lesswrong appears to have spread via numerous lesswrong meetups.

Its early publications appear to have had less direct impact on shaping the research agendas being pursued today</span></p>\n<h3><span>Future of Humanity Institute</span></h3>\n<p>FHI was established by Nick Bostrom and Anders Sandberg in 2005 with funding from James Martin and the Bright Horizons Foundation.&#xA0;<sup><a href=\"#ftnt10\">[10]</a></sup><span>&#xA0;Some of the activities that FHI undertook in the years up to 2012 were:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Funding of the blog Overcoming Bias</span></li>\n<li><span>Organization of Whole Brain Emulation Workshop</span></li>\n<li><span>Direct research</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Publishing of Global Catastrophic Risks</span></li>\n<li><span>Publishing of Anthropic Bias</span></li>\n<li><span>Publishing of Human Enhancement</span></li>\n<li><span>Numerous papers by Bostrom, Sandberg, and others</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Creation of an intellectual microcosm</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Toby Ord was a researcher at FHI when he and others launched Giving What We Can, which led directly to the formation of the Effective Altruism movement.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>FHI appears to have placed less emphasis on AI safety in its early days compared to the present day. To my mind, it looks as if much of the impact of FHI&#x2019;s early work flows through the later publishing of Superintelligence by Bostrom. To a first approximation, the early FHI research appears to have had much of its impact by giving Bostrom the credibility and platform that allowed his later book to have such a broad reception.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>One might also speculate about what if any contribution FHI&#x2019;s early work had in spurring Toby Ord to start Giving What We Can by Toby Ord in 2009, which was one of the foundations on which the early Effective Altruism community was built. Ord and Bostrom were publishing together as early as 2006<sup><a href=\"#ftnt11\">[11]</a></sup>. On the other hand, there are no other FHI staff on the list of early Giving What We Can pledges.<sup><a href=\"#ftnt12\">[12]</a></sup></p>\n<h3><span>GiveWell</span></h3>\n<p><span>GiveWell was founded in 2008 by Holden Karnofsky and Elie Hassenfeld to study philanthropic giving opportunities and make recommendations to small and medium-sized donors. GiveWell was never focused on AI safety, although GiveWell Labs did appear to conduct an informal evaluation of SIAI in 2012, which was negative.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>From an AI safety perspective, GiveWell&#x2019;s largest impact has almost certainly been the creation of the Open Philanthropy Project, which is the primary adviser to the multi-billion dollar fund, Good Ventures, and has identified risks from advanced AI as a focus area.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>It seems to me that the largest impacts from GiveWell&#x2019;s early work flowed through the people who went on to create OpenPhil, and the culture of approaching philanthropy as an intellectually serious endeavor. The direct work performed by GiveWell was almost certainly crucial in attracting talent to the cause, and capturing the attention of Good Ventures, but this impact appears to flow to a large extent through people and culture, both of which were critical to the later creation of OpehPhil.</p>\n<h2><span>Heuristics for funding AI safety organizations</span></h2>\n<h3><span>Focus on People</span></h3>\n<p><span>Some of the largest impacts of funding FHI or SIAI in their early years appear to have flown through the individuals those organizations hired, who went on to contribute substantially within the community. I suspect that the early research performed by these organizations was impactful primarily insofar as it attracted certain individuals into the community.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>One lens through which grant makers may view funding decisions is therefore as a sort of hiring decision in which the grant maker asks which people will be moved into the AI safety community as a result of the grant. For organizations that would not otherwise receive funding, this may encompass all individuals in the organization. For others, the grant-maker is moving whichever individuals end up being hired as a result of the grant.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>When making a hiring decision, it is of course important to review past work and evaluate the impact that the candidate&#x2019;s planned work will have, yet most hiring decisions also place substantial weight on a more nebulous sense of the potential of bringing intelligent, motivated, value-aligned individuals into an organization. Grant makers should similarly take this more nebulous component seriously, since it appears to have accounted for a significant amount of the impact of past funding decisions in the field.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Interestingly, this matches the oft-quoted wisdom among startup investors of making early-stage investments largely on the strength of the team that runs the company.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Platforms Matter</span></h3>\n<p>Bostrom&#x2019;s book Superintelligence probably could not have gained such widespread exposure without Bostrom having built up a serious academic platform<sup><a href=\"#ftnt13\">[13]</a></sup>. The platform on which he launched Superintelligence was built over 14 years, and during this time he authored more than a hundred papers, presented at many hundreds of conferences and workshops, and gave numerous media appearances.<sup><a href=\"#ftnt14\">[14]</a></sup><span>&#xA0;Yet a large component of impact of all this work thus far does not seem to have been the direct insights gleaned or the direct effects of public outreach on specific issues, but instead seems to have flown through the creation of a platform upon which his later views on AI safety could reach a broad audience.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>A grant maker considering funding FHI during the 2000-2010 period may have been tempted to evaluate the impact of the direct work that the organization planned to pursue in the short term, but this would have largely missed the most important resource being generated at FHI.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Culture and Intellectual Environments</span></h3>\n<p>Through the creation of LessWrong, SIAI caused a worldwide network to coalesce around ideas in philosophy, math, and AI. This network had distinctive culture that appears to me to have had a substantial impact on today&#x2019;s AI safety community<sup><a href=\"#ftnt15\">[15]</a></sup><span>. The long-term cultural impacts of FHI appears to have been even larger, particularly if we give it partial credit for creating the intellectual environment in which Giving What We Can and eventually the broader Effective Altruism movement formed.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Culture is difficult to measure or predict. Early funders of SIAI or FHI would have had difficulty foreseeing the long-term cultural impacts these organizations would have, yet these cultural outcomes do appear to have been a very significant component of the respective organizations&#x2019; impact, so are worth taking seriously.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>This also matches a widespread belief among technology startups that early company culture is&#xA0;a&#xA0;<span>critical determinant of long term success or failure.</span></p>\n<h3><span>Funding begets further funding</span></h3>\n<p><span>If the growth thesis above is correct then making grants today has the potential to move many times as much money in the future, if making a grant now causes an organization to be more likely to exist, or be more prominent during a future AI safety growth phase.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Early GiveWell supporters surely deserve some credit for the much larger amounts of money that OpenPhil is now moving. Similarly, early FHI and SIAI backers deserve some credit for the more substantial present day budgets of those organizations.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>For AI safety grant makers today, this implies that funding early-stage organizations may have particularly high impact, since it can make the difference between an organization existing and not existing during a future growth phase. This provides one argument in favor of giving now rather than giving later.<sup><a href=\"#ftnt16\">[16]</a></sup></p>\n<h2><span>Feedback Loops</span></h2>\n<p><span>It looks to me that the largest effects of funding AI safety organizations will materialize through growth and the feedback loops that drive them:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Cultural feedback</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Initial effect: founding team lays down a certain culture within an organization</span></li>\n<li><span>Feedback effect: as new people enter the organization they adopt the culture of those already in the organization</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Hiring feedback</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Initial effect: an organization uses money from a grant to hire people</span></li>\n<li>Feedback effect: some of those people start new organizations, which continue to hire more people, or contribute to hiring decisions</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Memetic feedback</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Initial effect: by encountering work published by an organization, individuals outside the AI safety community adjust their views on AI safety</span></li>\n<li>Feedback effect: memes propagate to further individuals</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Funding feedback</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Initial effect: an organization receives a grant</span></li>\n<li><span>Feedback effect: other grant makers choose whether to funding this and similar organizations based on its perceived success or failure</span></li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span>Conclusion</span></h2>\n<p><span>With the entry of several large grant makers to the AI safety space, many of the largest organizations appear to have exhausted their capacity for additional funding. Furthermore, the budgets of these organizations remain small compared to the total capital that AI safety grant makers hope to deploy in the next few years, so the re-emergence of significant funding gaps among well-established organizations seems unlikely even as these organizations scale up.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Nevertheless, individual grant makers may hope to find large opportunities for impact by identifying funding opportunities among small organizations, since we must assume that the AI safety community will grow substantially at some point if it is not have substantial impact.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>When making funding decisions, grant makers should pay special attention to opportunities to &#x201C;hire&#x201D; people into the overall AI safety community, and the unique culture that some organizations foster. In addition, grant makers should seize opportunities to help individuals build up platforms upon which their ideas can reach a wide audience, and be aware that grants made today may move much larger sums of money in the future.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Donors who take these nebulous factors seriously may find opportunities for impact missed by grant makers that focus more on the immediate work generated by grants.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<hr>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"#ftnt_ref1\">[1]</a><span>&#xA0;For one snapshot of the funding landscape from 2003 until 2010, see&#xA0;</span><span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=http://lesswrong.com/lw/5il/siai_an_examination/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1520823693513000&amp;usg=AFQjCNFY_o5Aq4qPNGtaP8knAWS6i9xftA\">http://lesswrong.com/lw/5il/siai_an_examination/</a></span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"#ftnt_ref2\">[2]</a><span>&#xA0;The Singularity Institute for Artificial Intelligence, which was renamed to the Machine Intelligence Research Institute in 2014</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"#ftnt_ref3\">[3]</a><span>&#xA0;See e.g. https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"#ftnt_ref4\">[4]</a><span>&#xA0;https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-catastrophic-risks/potential-risks-advanced-artificial-intelligence/</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"#ftnt_ref5\">[5]</a><span>&#xA0;https://futureoflife.org/background/benefits-risks-of-artificial-intelligence/</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"#ftnt_ref6\">[6]</a><span>&#xA0;http://existence.org/grants</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"#ftnt_ref7\">[7]</a><span>&#xA0;https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"#ftnt_ref8\">[8]</a><span>&#xA0;E.g.&#xA0;</span><span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_Machine_Intelligence_Research_Institute&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1520823693511000&amp;usg=AFQjCNGT-Dg1aN-VUWoWkGwSBNK4Hd0hkQ\">https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_Machine_Intelligence_Research_Institute</a></span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"#ftnt_ref9\">[9]</a><span>&#xA0;</span><span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_Machine_Intelligence_Research_Institute&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1520823693510000&amp;usg=AFQjCNH_pxFvGgnC06AyWzUmV6EIhGqF6g\">https://timelines.issarice.com/wiki/Timeline_of_Machine_Intelligence_Research_Institute</a></span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"#ftnt_ref10\">[10]</a><span>&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p><span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://web.archive.org/web/20060512085807/http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk:80/Papers/FHI%2520Newsletter%25201%2520-%2520April%2520200611.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1520823693509000&amp;usg=AFQjCNF_CZw7MoqlOKVZnq4v4bFJH_BPFg\">https://web.archive.org/web/20060512085807/http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk:80/Papers/FHI%20Newsletter%201%20-%20April%20200611.pdf</a></span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"#ftnt_ref11\">[11]</a><span>&#xA0;Nick&#xA0;</span><span>Bostrom, and Toby Ord. &quot;The reversal test: eliminating status quo bias in applied ethics.&quot;</span><span>Ethics</span><span>&#xA0;116.4 (2006): 656-679.</span><span>)</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"#ftnt_ref12\">[12]</a><span>&#xA0;</span><span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/members/&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1520823693513000&amp;usg=AFQjCNE4d3Uo2_xsiLmRkT5dLHEyr6vLiQ\">https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/members/</a></span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"#ftnt_ref13\">[13]</a><span>&#xA0;Looking through the nonfiction category of the New York Times bestsellers list, I see few published by individuals who do not already have a substantial platform.</span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"#ftnt_ref14\">[14]</a><span>&#xA0;</span><span><a href=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://nickbostrom.com/cv.pdf&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1520823693510000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEuI6lwSo6KjsWNZHZq8cbJBuzOiQ\">https://nickbostrom.com/cv.pdf</a></span></p>\n</div>\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"#ftnt_ref15\">[15]</a><span>&#xA0;This is very difficult to justify explicitly.

I think there is a lot of exploration value hidden in this project.&nbsp;It&nbsp;falls&nbsp;into the category of prioritization research and improving institutional decision-making.</p><p>The project is called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.ceskepriority.cz/\">Czech Priorities</a>, it will be run by the&nbsp;Copenhagen Consensus Center (CCC) and the aim is to identify the smartest solutions to the most pressing social and economic challenges in the Czech Republic, with expected over-spill effects in the region and possibly across Europe, if it turns out&nbsp;easy to replicate&nbsp;in other countries.</p><p><i>Note: For the last 14 months I led the Czech EA Association. Lot of credit for it goes to my colleagues and volunteers, especially for organizing EAGx conference, first two public CFAR workshops in Europe, the&nbsp;</i><a href=\"http://effectivethesis.com/\"><i>Effective thesis</i></a><i>&nbsp;project, or for&nbsp;</i><a href=\"/ea/166/donor_lottery_details/cwv\"><i>receiving a donation</i></a><i>&nbsp;that allows us to pay full-time staff in 2018. I now work for the Copenhagen Consensus Center and the project I will talk about here is run separately from our EA activities and we do not publicly associate it with the Czech EA.</i></p><p><strong>Project background</strong></p><p>About a year ago, Copenhagen Consensus Center&nbsp;was considering, among many other projects around the world, carrying out a national prioritization project in the Czech Republic.&nbsp;We&nbsp;knew a Czech philanthropist, who really likes economic prioritization and lives on the same street in Prague as Bjorn Lomborg, president of the Copenhagen Consensus Center. They have met and the donor committed to fund 1/5 of the project, identifying couple of other potential sources of funding. The CCC has done full-scale national prioritization projects in developing countries so far (e.g. Haiti, Bangladesh, India) and now has a methodology, infrastructure, will and the momentum to try it in a developed country as well.</p><p>Our goal is to raise the remaining 2 million USD in 2018, hire a team, spend two years doing world-class cost-benefit analyses on approx. 70 of the most promising local (state or non-governmental) interventions (contracting the best economists in all areas), and create public awareness by disseminating the results (list of top national priorities with \u201cprice tags\u201d) through popular media (something like: \u201eWOW, 1 extra Koruna invested into pre-school education can bring 17 Korunas of benefits!\u201c). Previous projects show, that this is a very effective way to create a pressure on politicians, who eventually realize it\u2019s both rational and politically smart to take at least some of those priorities, include them in their program and actually support them from the taxpayer\u00b4s money.</p><p><strong>Pilot in a developed country</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/global-priorities-research/\">Global priorities research</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/improving-institutional-decision-making/\">improving institutional decision-making</a>&nbsp;are very effective causes (they have indeed been listed on the 3rd and 4th spot in the 80k Hours\u00b4 list of priorities last year). But when I started working for this project, just to be completely compliant with EA thinking, I decided to look for funds only from sources that would not otherwise be used to fund AI Safety, promoting effective altruism or specific projects in third world countries, where the bang-for-the-buck ratio would likely be higher.&nbsp;Having worked&nbsp;on the project for four months, I came to realized that it\u00b4s worthy to discuss, if Czech Priorities could have enough positive international over-spill effects and exploration value for the EA community, that it might actually be one of the most effective projects to fund, across the spectrum.</p><p>Will McAskill spent a large part of his closing speech at the 2017 EA Global conference in London talking about the importance of global priorities research. I talked to him, Richard Parr or people from Global Priorities Institute about this during the conference. Global Priorities Institute is, for example, at the moment doubling-down on philosophy and economics in their research. The comparative advantage of Copenhagen Consensus Center is, that Bjorn Lomborg knows how to work with politicians and get things going. Personally, I am a big fan of Global Priorities Institute\u00b4s philosophical work, and I am aware of the issues with external validity, causal inference, extrapolation and other deficits of RCTs and cost-benefit analyses. On the other hand, my background from political studies leads me to believe, that there might be surprisingly lot of additional value in orchestrated efforts towards actual political implementation of and advocacy for good enough ideas and effective policies.</p><p><strong>Exploration value</strong></p><p>Making a good use of prioritization research often seems to imply changing incentive structures of entire political systems, so that the most effective programs start getting implemented. Of course it would be most effective to do it globally, but is that even possible with our current resources? In its&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/post-2015-consensus\">Post-2015 Consensus</a>&nbsp;project, the CCC carried out great cost-benefit studies on UN\u00b4s Sustainable Development Goals. It generated lot of attention, but the structure of funding of SDGs remained mostly intact on an international level. There are a lot of initiatives trying to prioritize globally, but isn\u00b4t the whole planet a little too big of a playground to start at?</p><p>Wouldn\u00b4t it be more effective to start with prioritizations locally and then systematically scale-up, replicate, and localize the findings to other regions in the world, and then slowly work up to an international and global level? Wouldn\u2018t it be more applicable and politically acceptable to create deep understanding of priorities for each specific country and region, and only then prioritize among those priorities at an international level?</p><p><strong>Why the Czech Republic</strong></p><p>Here is a summary of why I think the Czech Republic would be the perfect guinea-pig among developed countries in which to test the effectiveness of a national prioritization project (this is my understanding, not a statement of the Copenhagen Consensus Center):</p><p><i><strong>Characteristics of the Czech Republic:</strong></i></p><p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>High potential for policy improvement</u>&nbsp;\u2013 Growing economy (fiscal surplus, world\u00b4s best monetary policy) but the tide seems to be about to turn (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/RekonstrukceStatu/videos/1982938231723523/\">here</a>&nbsp;or below). Basic needs of people are mostly covered, but social inequality is increasing and the country is notably underperforming neighboring Germany and Austria in indexes of well-being and opportunity.</p><p>\u00b7&nbsp; &nbsp;<u>Attractive&nbsp;place for R&amp;D&nbsp;</u>- bridge between Western and Eastern Europe, increasingly attractive for living, unused global advantage in IT and R&amp;D (low-cost,&nbsp;well educated&nbsp;researchers and developers).</p><p>\u00b7&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<u>Size&nbsp;</u>\u2013 with 10 million people, it\u2019s relatively easy to have an impact on institutions (especially with this government), very little institutional and private money invested in strategy and prioritization so far, good track-record of \"public lobby\" initiatives.</p><p><i><strong>Problems to solve:</strong></i></p><p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Still urgent post-communist social problems -</u>&nbsp;1 in 10 people living under poverty line, most middle class considered poor by EU standards, 10% of citizens under property distraint</p><p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Felt need for changes&nbsp;</u>\u2013 country is not run effectively (too much bureaucracy, corruption, e-government initiatives becoming obsolete, etc.), economy is based on industries with low long-term potential (car industry, mechanical engineering, transit etc).</p><p>\u00b7&nbsp; &nbsp;<u>Fear of Czexit</u>&nbsp;\u2013 strong political propaganda against EU, pro-EU part of the political spectrum is broken, populist parties are seriously talking about referendum for Czexit, the president is openly pro-Russian and pro-Chinese (this is a very emotional issue for Czech people, who feel that we need to improve something as soon as possible. If Czexit happens, the country will likely fall back to the level of Bulgaria and the concept of the EU will be seriously undermined in the region).</p><p><i><strong>Why national prioritization should work here:</strong></i></p><p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Environment is ready&nbsp;</u>\u2013 we are in contact with the largest Czech economic institutions and politicians across the spectrum, have informal pre-commitment from the Ministry of Finance, much non-financial support from the NGO sector and a notable media attention by now.</p><p>\u00b7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <u>Ability to implement the outcomes</u>&nbsp;\u2013 Current Prime Minister, even though controversial, is pragmatic and claims to like data-based politics. Chances are high, that there will be political power to implement some of the outcomes.</p><p>\u00b7&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<u>Ability to assess impact&nbsp;</u>- Economic performance historically related to Germany (traceable indiators of progress), member of Visegrad group of countries (similar cultural background \u2013 good for counterfactual testing, effects of policy changes are regionally comparable and measurable).</p><p><i><strong>Expected outcomes:</strong></i></p><p><u>Scenario 1 (positive):</u>&nbsp;A new or existing political party agrees to implement our outcomes and consults the program with EA and Copenhagen Consensus Center. A first political party in Europe with an EA-aligned evidence-based program could be created. It could be an interesting case study. Strong effects of the supported interventions and/or good performance of the party would build strong arguments for prioritization projects to be implemented in other developed countries.</p><p><u>Scenario 2 (positive):</u>&nbsp;Economy and politics keep improving on their own. Media disseminates the outcomes and politicians eventually implement at least some of the recommendations. Robust impact assessment methods are applied. As above, lives of citizens are effectively improved, compared to counterfactual. The cost-benefit ratios can be used for new experimental projects such as prediction markets for the well-being of citizens or a ground for voting in a DAO democracy (Some Czech entrepreneurs would likely want to take up the challenge of being the first country to experiment with decentralized voting/democracy, similarly as Estonia did with e-government and finance).</p><p><u>Scenario 3 (neutral):</u>&nbsp;Most results don\u00b4t get implemented or become suddenly outdated (due to political shifts, economic crisis, etc.). In this case, at least a part of the outcomes can be used by the NGO sector or in other countries to better fight system ineffectiveness. Cost-befit prioritization methodology will be better localized, fine-tuned to approach problems in developed world.</p><p><u>Scenario 4 (negative):</u>&nbsp;Outcomes cannot be implemented at all (methodology fails to reasonably assess long-term and overspill effects, project is seriously discredited etc.) In this case, we learn that national prioritization projects in developed countries need to be done more carefully/are not effective/are difficult or impossible.</p><p><strong>A bit of Murphyjitsu</strong></p><p>I am also trying to build a mental model of this: Would it have made sense to invest into such projects during the 20th century, when we could have prevented developed countries from falling to spheres of influence of expansive authoritarian regimes? A bit of nudging towards rationality seemed to work well in Greece or Italy after WW2. Should we have done that more in Eastern Europe? How about North Korea or Vietnam? Iran? Cuba or Venezuela?&nbsp;Geopolitics is extremely complex, of course, but some general&nbsp;historical shifts repeat throughout history. Speaking of Italy, it also decided to take the irrational, populist political path, literally yesterday.&nbsp;</p><p>I am wittingly neglecting lot of variables here,&nbsp;but what if we wake up 15 years from now, and see that countries of the former Soviet bloc have naturally (and suddenly) gravitated back to some form of authoritarianism (mentality is hard to change in one generation) and the Western world spends billions of dollars on development aid to previously developed areas, which deeply rooted problems have been underestimated? Would we be shocked? And what if in times of optimism, a couple of smart projects could spread the critical mass of political rationality across the region? Will it look obvious 15 years from now, that we should have done exactly that? Being very difficult to measure and predict, the probability of sudden authoritarian surges&nbsp;in Eastern Europe might be higher than available data would indicate. At least my inner-sim tells me, that I wouldn\u00b4t be too shocked if something like that happens.</p><p><strong>Summary</strong></p><p>I suggest that national, cross-sector cost-benefit prioritization project in a small, regionally important developed country could be a great thing for EA donors to fund at the moment, especially for it\u00b4s exploration value. To improve institutional decision-making and international prioritization, it seems to be best to start locally, implement, measure, and then scale-up, replicate and localize the findings to other regions in the world and only then work up to global level. From a long-term view, by focusing national prioritization only on the poorest regions of the world, we are likely to miss out some important international over-spill effects coming from solving neglected structural problems in more developed countries.</p><p>At this point, Copenhagen Consensus Center has proven EA-aligned methodology, infrastructure for local prioritization projects, it works around the world, and the Czech Republic seems like a good place to start in Europe. We have spent 6 months preparing the environment and this opportunity for a case study shouldn\u00b4t be passed.</p><p>I\u00b4ll be happy to hear your views, ideas about who could be a good EA partner for&nbsp;us and how to make such national prioritization projects take off.</p><p>Also, please refer me to any studies that argue for or against this kind of reasoning.</p>", "user": {"username": "janklenha"}}, {"_id": "Z95TxtkjHGPq4TAqY", "title": "Why not to rush to translate effective altruism into other languages", "postedAt": "2018-03-05T02:17:20.153Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><span>Over the last year, I&#x2019;ve been doing research into the intersection between effective altruism in China (see our </span><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/china-careers/\"><span>recent article</span></a><span> on the topic). I participated in a retreat in Hong Kong on this topic, and oversaw the funding and mentoring of someone to work full-time on research and advising to help Western organisations learn about the country. I also speak basic conversational Chinese, have lived for almost a year in the country, and was heavily involved in our first efforts to promote effective altruism in the West.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>All this has made me very cautious about trying to translate effective altruism materials into Chinese, or do broad based outreach in the country.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>I think many of the arguments behind this position also apply to translating effective altruism materials into other languages. <strong>So, I think most efforts to do this translation work should probably be delayed.</strong> The more different the language, culture and politics, the longer we should wait.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Instead, <strong>I think that efforts to expand effective altruism into other languages should initially focus on person-to-person outreach to a small number of people with key expertise.</strong></span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>In the rest of this post, I outline four reasons why, and sketch an alternative approach.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>1) Doing mass outreach in another language creates irreversible &#x201C;lock in&#x201D;</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>We made many mistakes doing outreach in the UK and USA, which have been difficult to unwind. For instance, even today many people think 80,000 Hours is primarily about earning to give, despite us <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/07/80000-hours-thinks-that-only-a-small-proportion-of-people-should-earn-to-give-long-term\">saying many times</a> we don&#x2019;t think earning to give is typically the highest-impact option.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>In this way, any kind of broad based outreach is risky because it&#x2019;s hard to reverse. Once your message is out there, it tends to stick around for years, so if you get the message wrong, you&#x2019;ve harmed years of future efforts. We call this the risk of &#x201C;lock in&#x201D;.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Lock in is partly caused because once there are websites and media articles about you, they stick around. But it&#x2019;s also because first impressions are difficult to shift.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>The existence of lock in means it&#x2019;s worth delaying broad based outreach to increase the chance of getting the messages right first time.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>China faces especially high risk of lock in, because you also face the risk of government censorship, but the consideration applies in any language.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>2) It&#x2019;s very difficult to translate effective altruism</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>There&#x2019;s a huge amount we still don&#x2019;t understand about how to explain effective altruism in English, and translating it into a different language creates a whole host of other problems. </span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Making translations with the right nuance is difficult. For instance, the direct Chinese translation of &#x201C;effective altruism&#x201D; that was initially used (&#x6709;&#x6548;&#x5229;&#x4ED6;&#x4E3B;&#x4E49;) had the following problems:</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>1. Used a term for &#x201C;altruism&#x201D; that implied a great deal of self-sacrifice.</span></p>\n<p><span>2. Sounds obviously foreign, which we expect would make it less appealing.</span></p>\n<p><span>3. Sounds like a political ideology, which may not be viewed positively by the government.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Likewise, one of the possible translations of &#x201C;existential risk&#x201D; (&#x751F;&#x5B58;&#x5371;&#x673A;) is very close to the the name of a computer game (&#x751F;&#x5316;&#x5371;&#x673A;), so doesn&#x2019;t have the credibility one might want. </span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>What&#x2019;s more, each culture is different, and ideas often need to be presented in different ways depending on the context. For instance, Chinese writing makes a much greater use of historical analogies and ancient quotes than similar English writing. Rather than quote Peter Singer, we might consider <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozi\">quoting Mozi</a></span><span> -- arguably the earliest consequentialist philosopher in history who in wrote around 400 BC of the importance of &#x201C;universal concern&#x201D; (</span><a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%85%BC\"><span>&#x517C;</span></a><a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%84%9B\"><span>&#x611B;</span></a><span>) towards all people. </span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Likewise, many materials in the West focus on the value of donating to charities in Africa, but internationally focused philanthropy is much rarer in China, and the Chinese government has prohibited foreign nonprofit organisations fundraising in the country, so this doesn&#x2019;t seem like a promising route.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>The ideas can also combine in unexpected ways with the local culture, leading to surprising results. For instance, effective altruism culture is fairly different in Oxford, the Bay Area and the German-speaking world.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>It&#x2019;s unlikely we&#x2019;ll successfully navigate these kinds of problems unless we have people who are both excellent writers and marketers in the new language <em>and</em> have an in-depth understanding of effective altruism as it currently exists. But these kinds of people are often in short supply, and it would be better to wait until we find some.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>This problem is greater the more culturally different the country of the new language is, so the greater the difference the longer we should wait to translate. My guess is that French is relatively safe (though likely still worth delaying), while we should wait longest to translate and promote materials in Chinese, Japanese, Russian and Arabic.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>3) Existing English language materials are often out of date</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Our views have changed significantly in just the last couple of years, so many existing materials don&#x2019;t reflect our current views.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>For instance, personally, I think <em>Doing Good Better</em> is too focused on donating to charity, contributing to the widely repeated assertion that effective altruism is &#x201C;about how to donate to effective charities,&#x201D; when actually it&#x2019;s about all ways to do good, and where we think decisions about your career or policy change are often more important than decisions about where to donate.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Likewise, <em>Doing Good Better</em> is focused on global health and short-term issues, when today we think global catastrophic risks, emerging technologies and long-term issues are more urgent.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Translating effective altruism into a new language gives us a chance to correct outdated views and avoid lock in with those old views, and it&#x2019;s a shame to waste that opportunity by directly translating old materials.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>4) Mass outreach is not a good way to promote effective altruism in general</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>The ideas of effective altruism are unusually complex, and mass outreach tends to oversimplify them, leading to misunderstandings getting locked in. We still have a lot of work to do working out how best to frame the ideas in English, and this favours small-scale outreach where you can get rapid feedback on how well you&#x2019;re being understood. </span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>What&#x2019;s more, it&#x2019;s usually higher-impact to have a small number of highly involved people than hundreds of are merely aware of the ideas, or only participating in a superficial way. This is because impact is a product of how much effort someone invests and how effective their efforts are. A highly engaged person might exert 10-times the effort (e.g. donate 20% rather than 2%) and work 10-times more effectively, making for 100-times the impact. </span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>More concretely, if you&#x2019;re running a local group, then finding one other dedicated volunteer can mean the difference between the group surviving and failing, which is more important than having hundreds of people who attend events but don&#x2019;t help out. Likewise, finding one person who speaks the language and really gets the ideas, or has knowledge relevant to a top problem area, is more useful than having thousands of people know about the ideas in a superficial way.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>For both reasons, we think it&#x2019;s usually better to focus on in-depth outreach to a small number of people, ideally through person-to-person discussions, rather than widely promoted short-form content or other mass marketing.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>This can feel a bit counterintuitive. We find that people new to building the effective altruism community often think they should focus on getting media attention, inviting famous speakers to events, and &#x201C;partnerships&#x201D; with prestigious groups. But these approaches don&#x2019;t normally yield as many results as building strong person-to-person relationships with genuinely enthusiastic people, and they also pose greater risks.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>If written materials </span><span>are</span><span> used, then it&#x2019;s better to focus on books, academic articles and podcasts aimed at a niche audience. Read more about the &#x201C;<a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/blog/the-fidelity-model-of-spreading-ideas/\">fidelity model</a>&quot;</span><span>, and &#x201C;<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/how-valuable-is-movement-growth-owen-cotton-barratt/\">how valuable is movement growth</a>&#x201D;</span><span>, which argues that we should focus on how attractive the ideas are before spreading them widely. The approach we advocate here also has similarities with Y Combinator&apos;s</span><span> &#x201C;<a href=\"http://paulgraham.com/ds.html\">do things that don&#x2019;t scale</a>&#x201D;</span><span> advice.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>What should we do instead?</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Rather than &#x201C;translating&#x201D; effective altruism into new languages, it seems better to think in terms of creating a local movement from scratch that&#x2019;s </span><span>inspired</span><span> by the ideas of effective altruism, but is highly adapted to the local context. Imagine that Will MacAskill was Chinese: then what would he have written?</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>To do this well, we&#x2019;ll need people who are both experts in the local culture and effective altruism in the West. We&#x2019;ll also need people who are excellent writer and communicators in the new language.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Initial efforts to expand effective altruism into new languages should focus on making strong connections with a small number of people who have relevant expertise, via person-to-person outreach instead of mass media.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Instead of creating irreversible risks, this strategy has two benefits.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>First, it has a significant short-term impact, because finding even a small number of really engaged community members is valuable.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Second, it puts us in a better position to do outreach in the future, because these initial connections will better understand the new language and culture, enabling better translations and outreach in the future.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>One counterargument is that you face a chicken and egg problem. Without mass outreach, you could argue that it&#x2019;s hard to find anyone interested in the ideas, or gain credibility. However, I don&#x2019;t think this argument holds up.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>The recent <a href=\"/ea/1h5/ea_survey_2017_series_how_do_people_get_into_ea/\">survey of the community</a></span><span>, showed that the media has played a comparatively small role in getting people involved. Rather, the biggest single entry route was personal referral. Some of these entrances into the community might have been aided by the existence of media, but I suspect many could have happened without.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>For this reason, I expect that it&#x2019;s possible to start getting people involved in new countries with more person-to-person outreach. This would mean speaking to and arranging smalls events with (i) friends (ii) existing community members who speak the new language, and (iii) connections of connections from the previous two groups.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Beyond this, you could find more people by targeting lectures and discussion groups at especially promising groups. With these, it&#x2019;s better to have a small event where the ideas are accurately expressed than one with a well-known speaker who doesn&#x2019;t quite get what effective altruism is about.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Once you have an initial community of around 100 people, you could start creating written materials to support these efforts. But these materials would initially be tested on people you already know rather than promoted widely. If you need more credibility to support these efforts, rather than seek new press coverage, you could mention the achievements of effective altruism in other countries.</span></p>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Only after significant testing would you release public written materials. Even then, it would be better to focus on in-depth materials like books and podcasts, rather than short-form media articles.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Translating effective altruism into new languages has the potential to have a tremendous impact, but could also spoil future efforts if done badly, slowing efforts by many years. If we start with in-depth, targeted, in-person outreach, we can make significant progress while reducing these risks.</span></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Benjamin_Todd"}}, {"_id": "nhLecBGBJxT7gk6ce", "title": "[Paper] Surviving global risks through the preservation of humanity's data on the Moon", "postedAt": "2018-03-03T18:39:56.988Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>My, with David Denkenberger, article about surviving global risks through the preservation of the data on the Moon has been accepted in Acta Astronautica.

This requires information preservation of an order of magnitude of 100 million years, a little-explored topic thus far. It is important that a potential future civilization will discover this information as early as possible, thus a beacon should accompany the message in order to increase visibility. The message should ideally contain information about how humanity was destroyed, perhaps including a continuous recording until the end. This could help the potential future civilization to survive. The best place for long-term data storage is under the surface of the Moon, with the beacon constructed as a complex geometric figure drawn by small craters or trenches around a central point.

First I want to disclose some important differences in how the three organisations operate and report their numbers. I would stress that readers only update on the numbers given based on their magnitude and general trend, not their exact numerical value, as I&#x2019;ve not invested a lot of time in preparing this.<br><br></span></p>\n<p><span>TLYCS have not published an impact report for 2017, so the numbers below is from </span><a href=\"https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Portals/0/Annual%20Report%202016%20-%20The%20Life%20You%20Can%20Save.pdf\"><span>their 2016 report</span></a><span>. Each of the last three years they have grown substantially, so I expect their numbers to be significantly higher in 2017. Since GiveWell themselves are based in the US, they would &#x201C;compete&#x201D; with TLYCS in doing EA fundraising for the GW recommended charities. Note also that TLYCS fundraise for more than just these charities.<br><br></span></p>\n<p><span>EAF provided me with the amount raised for GW recommendations, excluding what is associated with </span><a href=\"https://reg-charity.org/\"><span>REG</span></a><span> (an EAF project). EAF also fundraises for other charities than GW recommended charities, but this is not included here. EAF also told me that they expect their efforts in 2017 would result in donations of $10-20 million in 2018, most of which will likely be donated to GiveWell recommended charities. Here, I&#x2019;ve used the conservative figure that only includes funds raised through their own website in 2017. I don&#x2019;t know how this distributes between Germany, Switzerland and other countries, but I&#x2019;ll just assume Germany and Switzerland provides everything.<br><br></span></p>\n<table><colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>&#xA0;</td>\n<td><span>USD moved</span></td>\n<td><span>Inhabitants (mill)</span></td>\n<td><span>USD moved <br>per 1000 inhabitants</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>Effect - Norway</span></td>\n<td><span>$ 232 000</span></td>\n<td><span>5.233</span></td>\n<td><span>$ 44.3</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>TLYCS - USA</span></td>\n<td><span>$ 2 700 000</span></td>\n<td><span>323.1</span></td>\n<td><span>$ 8.4</span></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><span>EAF - Ger./Swiss</span></td>\n<td><span>$ 1 800 000</span></td>\n<td><span>82.62 + 8.40</span></td>\n<td><span>$ 19.8</span></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p><strong>&#xA0;</strong></p>\n<p><span>Norway is a small country, but the support of foreign aid in the general public is high and the median income level is one of the highest in the world.

However we&#x2019;ve invested a limited amount of money and time and still we&#x2019;ve got solid results. I believe there are low hanging improvements like implementing a better, more automated donation system, getting tax deductibility status and better utilize effective marketing strategies. Therefore, I believe that we could reach USD 0.65-1 mill within 3-5 years in yearly donations and keep, or increase, the share of counterfactual donations. A well coordinated collaboration with the newly formed </span><a href=\"http://www.effektivaltruisme.no/\"><span>EA Norway</span></a><span> would be essential.<br><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Currently the Effect Foundation does not have a funding gap as we are constrained on people rather than money. As a small organization based on volunteers, starting a fundraising and hiring process is paradoxically a barrier in it self. This could already change later this year if EA Norway gets funded and would help out with hiring, administration and strategy. Therefore a way of helping out Effect would be to support EA Norway.</span><span><br></span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;<span><br></span><span>If you have questions or comments that you don&apos;t want to post in the comments below, please send them to </span><a href=\"mailto:jorgen@stiftelseneffekt.no\"><span>jorgen@stiftelseneffekt.no</span></a><span>.

Davis.</em></p>\n<p>Rethink Charity is excited to announce our new project, Rethink Priorities, which is dedicated to doing foundational research on neglected causes in a highly empirical and transparent manner. This work will begin this year, beginning with a focus on lessons that can be taken from analyzing vaccinations as an intervention in the developing world and animal welfare corporate campaigns.</p>\n<p>This work will be led by Marcus A. Davis and Peter Hurford, with Marcus working full-time and Peter working part-time.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Marcus is a co-founder of Charity Entrepreneurship and Charity Science Health, where he systematically analyzed global poverty interventions, led cost-effectiveness analyses, and oversaw all technical aspects of the project. Before joining the Charity Science team, he ran Effective Altruism Chicago and worked with LEAN coordinating outreach to local EA groups around the globe.</p>\n<p>Peter is a data scientist working from Chicago. He co-founded Rethink Charity, and is on the board of Charity Science and Animal Charity Evaluators. He has reviewed and produced research on cause prioritization and effective altruism since 2013.</p>\n<p>In doing this research, we focus on the following principles:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Generating new insight and knowledge</strong> in addition to synthesizing existing research. We&#x2019;re focused more on producing cutting-edge content rather than summarizing existing content.</li>\n<li><strong>Publishing shorter and more digestible information more frequently</strong>, rather than publishing sprawling research less frequently. By taking the same amount of information and breaking it down into &#x201C;minimal publishing units,&#x201D; we make it easier for ourselves and others to understand and build upon, and get quicker feedback loops.</li>\n<li><strong>Emphasizing quick feedback loops</strong> trying to go from initial research to an initial publication in about a month.</li>\n<li><strong>Seeking tractability in research</strong> by looking for questions that we may be able to make meaningful progress on. <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/8ns/hack_away_at_the_edges/\">We&#x2019;ll hack away on the edges</a>, so to speak.</li>\n<li><strong>Keeping all research in touch with the bigger picture</strong>, building upon individual publications to try to answer key questions.</li>\n<li><strong>Finding new opportunities over creating more ranked lists of existing opportunities.</strong> We predict improving on existing uncertain ranking methods is less effective than finding directions that have been previously neglected in EA. We&#x2019;re unlikely to convince people of the number one cause, but we might find something others have not thought about.</li>\n<li><strong>Tracking the impact of our research</strong> to help us make key decisions. We have plans to do follow-up reviews on all our research, including surveys to determine the influence of the research.</li>\n<li><strong>Shutting the project down if it doesn&#x2019;t generate impact</strong> to avoid wasting our time and effort. We are pre-committing to an initial six month test phase and pivoting as necessary. We will completely shut down if there&#x2019;s no discernable impact within the first year. If our work isn&#x2019;t helping others make better decisions, we should try something else.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Right now, our research agenda is focused on:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>trying to learn how to apply cost-effectiveness frameworks to uncertain domains. (As an example, see our first post on <a href=\"/ea/1l4/how_much_does_it_cost_to_research_and_develop_a/\">vaccine research and development</a>.)</li>\n<li>prioritization and research work within interventions aimed at nonhuman animals (as research progress here looks uniquely tractable compared to other cause areas)</li>\n<li>assisting LEAN and SHIC in gathering evidence about EA movement building (as research here looks tractable and neglected)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>What we&#x2019;ve done so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"/ea/1l4/how_much_does_it_cost_to_research_and_develop_a/\">How Much Does it Cost to Research and Develop a Vaccine?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/ea/1l5/how_much_does_it_cost_to_rollout_a_vaccine/\">How Much Does it Cost to Roll-out a Vaccine?</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/ea/1kz/what_is_animal_farming_in_rural_zambia_like_a/\">What is Animal Farming in Rural Zambia Like?

The text is taken from our&#xA0;one-pager on organising the&#xA0;EAGx Netherlands conference in late June.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>EDIT:&#xA0;By&#xA0;implying below that, for example, a social entrepreneur should learn about population ethics from a Oxford professor to increase impact (and the professor can learn more about organisational processes and personal effectiveness), I don&apos;t mean&#xA0;to say&#xA0;that they&#xA0;should both become generalists. Rather, I mean to convey that the EA network enables people here to divide labour at particular decision levels and then pass on tasks and learned information to each other through collaborations, reciprocal favours and payments. <br>In a similar vein, I think it makes sense for CEA&apos;s Community Team to specialise in engaging existing community members on high-level EA concepts at weekend events and for Local Effective Altruism Network to help local groups get active and provide them with ICT support. However, I can think of 6 past instances where it seems that either CEA or LEAN could have potentially avoided making a mistake by incorporating the thinking of the other party at decision levels where it was stronger.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&quot;<span>EA Netherlands&#x2019; focus in 2018 is on building up a tight-knit and active core group of individuals that are exceptionally capable at doing good. </span><span>We assume that &#x2018;capacity to do good&#x2019; is roughly log-normal distributed, and that an individual&apos;s position on this curve results from effective traits acting as multipliers. We&#x2019;ve found this &#x2018;values-to-actions chain&#x2019; useful for decomposing it:</span></p>\n<p><span> &#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;&#xA0;capacity</span> <span>&#x221D;</span> <span>values </span><span>x</span><span> epistemology </span><span>x</span><span> causes </span><span>x</span><span> strategies </span><span>x</span><span> systems </span><span>x</span><span> actions</span><span><br><br></span></p>\n<p><span>That is, capacity to do good increases with the rigour of chained decisions &#x2013; from higher meta-levels (e.g. on moral uncertainty and crucial considerations) to getting things done on the ground.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>However, the capabilities of individuals in the Dutch EA community &#x2013; and the social networks they are embedded in &#x2013; tend to be unevenly distributed across these levels. On one end, people at </span><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/RationalityMeetupNL/?ref=br_rs\"><span>LessWrong meetups</span></a><span> seem relatively strong at deliberating what cause areas are promising to them (AI-alignment, mental health, etc.) but this often results in intellectual banter rather than next actions to take. The academics and student EA group leaders that we&#x2019;re in touch with face similar problems. On the other end, some of the young professionals in our &#xA0;community (graduates from university colleges, social entrepreneurs, etc.) as well as philanthropists and business leaders (through </span><a href=\"https://www.effectivegiving.nl/\"><span>Effective Giving</span></a><span>) have impressive track records in scaling organisations, but haven&#x2019;t deliberated much yet on what domain they should focus their entrepreneurial efforts on.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Our tentative opinion is that the individuals who build their capacity to do good the fastest are those most capable of rationally correcting and propagating their decisions through a broad set of levels (since a person&#x2019;s corrigibility at a given level of abstraction determines how fast they update their beliefs there with feedback).</span>&quot;</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "remmelt"}}, {"_id": "ctduj4nkf6ZZG8gA8", "title": " Where I am donating this year and meta projects that need funding", "postedAt": "2018-03-02T13:42:18.961Z", "htmlBody": "<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>In this post I cover:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>How to be the best donor I can be.</strong> Some high-level thinking on where to give to have the biggest impact as a medium size donor who is clued up on EA ideas and interested in meta charities.</li>\n<li><strong>Where I am giving and why.</strong> Details of where I am giving, some underfunded opportunities I found and why I think they are impactful.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h1>1. How to be the best donor I can be.\u00a0</h1>\n<p>In the year 1170 in the town of Fustat in Egypt, the philosopher, astrologer, physician and all round bad-ass Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon began to pen his magnum opus, \u201cMishnah Torah\u201d. In this he sets out a ladder with 8 rungs of effective charitable giving, working up from worst (giving unwillingly) to best (supporting self-sufficiency).</p>\n<p>Fast forward. It is now the year 2018. There is a lot more funding for meta and community building and x-risk projects than there has been previously. But not all is right with the world. Donor coordination is still hard with funders waiting to be the last to fill a funding gap. Worse, many smaller projects that could have a huge impact are not getting funded! Over 300 EA Grants applicants passed the first round of scrutiny but did not get funding. EA Ventures and EA funds have not solved this (although I remain cautiously optimistic about <a href=\"/ea/1ir/centre_for_effective_altruism_cea_2017_review_and/\">EA Grants Mk2</a>).</p>\n<p>As a medium donor (\u00a310-100k) with time to spend making a decision it is far from obvious what principles to apply to my decision making. But such donors can play an important role in funding smaller projects.\u00a0 So, harking back to my Jewish ancestors of old, here is a possible ladder of effective EA giving (beyond the <a href=\"/ea/cq/top_tips_on_how_to_choose_an_effective_charity/\">basics</a>):</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Fund something highly effective but already receiving significant funding</strong> (Eg. CEA or 80K or AMF or GiveDirectly). Alternatively outsource your giving to EA Funds or an EA lottery.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><strong>Find a impactful project with a funding gap it may not meet</strong>. With Good Ventures doing it\u2019s bit most larger EA related orgs have a reasonable funding stream. Yet smaller projects are slipping under the radar. Find them. Figure out their value. Fund them. Although don\u2019t be that person who waits until 30 seconds before the funding deadline to poke your head above the parapet and say \u2018happy to chip in if there is still a gap\u2019.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><strong>Find a small impactful project with a funding gap that you are uniquely qualified to evaluate.</strong> Let\u2019s say, for example, you are an expert in synthetic biology \u2013 do you know anyone looking for funding for research on bio-engineering risks, that you might be uniquely able to assess the value of? I expect that even if EA Grants Mk 2 takes off, they will struggle with projects that require expertise to fully understand and in many such cases hold back funding (as happened with EA Grants <a href=\"/ea/1fc/effective_altruism_grants_project_update/\">previously</a>.)<br /><br /></li>\n<li><strong>Be the catalyst for something new.</strong> This is the gold star of philanthropic prowess. What is the most important project that needs to exist in the world right now and can you offer funding to make it happen? Can your generosity make a start-up EA pipe dream into a reality? Is there a world-changing project that would world-change even better if it suddenly had more money in its coffers? Admittedly funding people before they have asked for funding risks capturing less dedicated people, however I am reasonably confident that competent potential EA entrepreneurs are out there waiting for the right financial nudge.<br /><br /></li>\n<li><strong>Keep on learning.</strong> Donating effectively is a skill, a difficult skill, but one I want to Master. The most important factor in my giving is that I continuously build my ability to do good. I give on an annual basis, reflect on the previous year\u2019s giving and try to do better. With the limited time to decide I take a different focus each year. Sometimes trying to use my money in ways that encourages others to give, sometimes making quick decisions, sometimes slow decisions. My experiment this year is to focus on finding small underfunded opportunities.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>So there we have it.\u00a0Five thoughts on being the best donor I can be this year. Let me know what you think.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h1>2 Where I am giving and why</h1>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2>Cause prioritisation</h2>\n<p>So before applying my principles of effective giving I decided to dabble in a spot of cause prioritisation.</p>\n<p>This year my giving will focus on:</p>\n<p><strong>Meta organisations</strong> (EA movement building, cause prioritisation research, etc). Having seen the success of charities in this area to date, with producing useful research, growing the EA community and raising significantly more funds than they spend, I believe this is where I can leverage the most good for the world.</p>\n<p>On top of that I want to focus on</p>\n<p><strong>Policy organisations.</strong> There is not lot of useful research in EA on policy. Improving policy could be considered a key cause area itself (<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/improving-institutional-decision-making/\">see here</a>) and presents opportunities for impact ranging from broad-brush x-risk reduction strategies (<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/articles/a-proposed-adjustment-to-the-astronomical-waste-argument-nick-beckstead/\">see here</a>) to highly impactful international development anti-corruption systemic change interventions (<a href=\"/ea/1jq/could_i_have_some_more_systemic_change_please_sir/\">see here</a>). It is also an area where I have some relevant expertise to evaluate suggestion.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2>Identifying organisations that I think should be funded</h2>\n<p>Now all that is needed is to find the places to give. So, I sat down, had a think and asked around. Where others giving? Do I know anyone entrepreneurial? Are there underfunded academics doing cause prioritisation? Does there a local group that needs funding? And so forth.</p>\n<p>And, after a bit of consideration and a few conversations I came up with the following shortlist of meta EA organisations I think should be funded. In the order I intend to fund them. Et volia:</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.appgfuturegenerations.com/\"><strong>The APPG for future generations</strong></a>\u00a0</p>\n<p>This APPG aiming to promote the idea that politics needs to think more about the long-term future and all the people who do not exist yet. Now APPGs do not tend to achieve a lot and are mostly talking shops for interesting ideas and ways for industry and pressure groups to get a foot in the door to having fancy events in Parliament. They are a cautious approach to lobbying. That said they can open doors and I think this is a sensible approach for people concerned with the far future to start influencing policy.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://eepurl.com/c3LGDv\">My current civil service project</a></strong></p>\n<p>I am currently working with others on a project to support UK civil servants keen to lead socially impactful careers. Think like 80000 Hours but within government rather than within universities. It is not clear how we would use funding at this stage but I think some funding could help them it off.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://sogive.org/\">SoGive</a></strong></p>\n<p>A project to nudge donations towards more effective charities. There is some chance of failure (it is a start-up) but I my personal estimate of the expected value of this is that an additional \u00a32+ will go to top EA charities for every \u00a31 invested. Other EA fundraising projects have been relatively successful and the person running this seems to know what he is doing.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"/ea/1hu/charity_science_health_has_room_for_more_funding/\"><strong>Charity Science Health</strong></a></p>\n<p>A project to start a new top recommended international development charity. Has a decent chance to be fully funded soon but this is not guaranteed.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://rtcharity.org/donate/\">Rethink Charity</a></strong></p>\n<p>EA movement building. Is collecting money to disburse to fund local groups. Has a decent chance to be fully funded soon but this is not guaranteed.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"http://ealondon.com/\">My local EA group (EA London)</a></strong></p>\n<p>EA London has a strong team, an ambitious plan, and good evidence of impact to date. My main reason for hesitation is that I think I am bias towards thinking this is a good project as I set it up and have been running it to date and am currently a Trustee. EA London has funding for 2018, but might struggle for funding beyond that, and an early donation could help (also if the funds are not needed they could be easily regranted to Rethink Charity or ACE).</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://app.effectivealtruism.org/funds/ea-community\">Effective altruism community fund (or other EA fund)</a></strong></p>\n<p>A good bet to have an expert fund manager decide where to give. However, I have <a href=\"/ea/1k9/ea_funds_hands_out_money_very_infrequently_should/\">not been super impressed</a>\u00a0by their work so far.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/donate/\">CEA</a></strong>\u00a0/ <strong><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/support-us/donate/\">80K</a></strong></p>\n<p>Amazing organisations doing amazing work. However, it looks like these organisations are not struggling for funds right now.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JuBtFGuD_HTBcbJ9humL0Zzf2Fo9pytrC5WY5Gyd3kI/edit\"><strong>GEM Labs</strong></a> (still in consideration)</p>\n<p>An EA project to do research into policy. I am still in discussion with them to figure out exactly what they are doing and why.\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<h2>The final countdown ... (dum de dum dum\u00a0 ...)</h2>\n<p>So that is the list. But how will I break down my funding between these fine specimens of moral worthiness?</p>\n<p>This year I have earned about \u00a355k and of that I want to give about \u00a315k to charity before the end of March with the following plan:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Fill funding commitments already made. I owe \u00a31000 to No Means No and \u00a3500 to AMF as a result of various Giving Games run this year. I will also offer small donations to SoGive and GEM Labs as a thank you for putting the time and effort into answering my questions.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>I am interested in any opportunities to fund the APPG for future Generations. Perhaps an offer of funding can help them be more ambitious. But otherwise:<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Put \u00a35k aside for the work I am doing within the civil service. Unless anyone else funds this which might happen.<br /><br /></li>\n<li>Split my remaining donations between SoGive, Charity Science Health and Rethink Charity (and maybe GEM labs depending on how discussions pan out). I do not have strong views as to which of these are best or what the diminishing marginal returns are on these projects.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So, there we have it. My 2016-17 donation plans. And it only took 2000 words. This approach of looking for small underfunded EA projects is somewhat a giving experiment but I hope to learn from it. Who knows, maybe next year I will revert back to making a last-minute decision and just donating to say AMF and 80K.</p>\n<p>But of course: <strong>please give feedback</strong>. My hope of writing this us is that the magic of collective internet brain power will have sensible things to say and change my plans for the better.</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>", "user": {"username": "weeatquince"}}, {"_id": "zFiGfWbZGgT8sGwRC", "title": "AI impacts and Paul Christiano on takeoff speeds", "postedAt": "2018-03-02T11:16:05.802Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><a href=\"https://sideways-view.com/2018/02/24/takeoff-speeds/\">Paul Christiano</a>&#xA0;and <a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/likelihood-of-discontinuous-progress-around-the-development-of-agi/\">AI Impacts</a> release posts arguing that a gradual improvement in AI capability is more likely than a discontinuous improvement.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Crosspost"}}, {"_id": "y4Kmnmf8meMix5DBc", "title": "New recommended career path for effective altruists: China specialists", "postedAt": "2018-03-01T21:18:46.124Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>This is the first new career path we&apos;ve promoted since AI policy and strategy 8 months ago.

What follows is the introduction to the full article.</p>\n<p>* * *</p>\n<p>Last summer, China unveiled a plan to become the world leader in artificial intelligence, aiming to create a $150 billion industry by 2030.</p>\n<p>&#x201C;We must take initiative to firmly grasp this new stage of development for artificial intelligence and create a new competitive edge,&#x201D;&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-ai/china-aims-to-become-world-leader-in-ai-challenges-u-s-dominance-idUSKBN1A5103\">the country&#x2019;s State Council said</a>. The move symbolised the technological thrust of &#x201C;the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation&#x201D; promoted by President Xi Jinping.</p>\n<p>And it&#x2019;s not just AI. China is becoming increasingly important in the solution of other global problems prioritised by the&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/\">effective altruism community</a>, including biosecurity, factory farming and nuclear security. But few in the community know much about the country, and coordination between Chinese and Western organisations seems like it could be improved a great deal.</p>\n<p>This suggests that a high-impact career path could be to develop expertise in the intersection between China, effective altruism and pressing global issues. Once you&#x2019;ve attained this expertise, you can use it to carry out research into global priorities or AI strategy; work in governments setting relevant areas of China-West policy, advise Western groups on how to work together with their Chinese counterparts, and other projects that we&#x2019;ll sketch below.</p>\n<p>For this reason, we&#x2019;ve added &#x201C;China specialists&#x201D; to the list of priority career paths we&#x2019;re preparing to publish. Although there&#x2019;s still much we don&#x2019;t understand about this area, we think it&#x2019;s an option especially worth considering if you&#x2019;re aligned with the effective altruism community, have an interest in China, and are relatively good at humanities compared to quantitative skills.</p>\n<p>In the rest of this article, we explain why understanding China is valuable. Then, we suggest concrete career steps you could take along this path, both in the short and long term, whether you have a Chinese or Western background. We&#x2019;ll also explain why we don&#x2019;t think&#xA0;<em>outreach</em>&#xA0;in China is a good idea right now.</p>\n<p>There are already several people going down this path, but we need a lot more expertise and connections. In the next few years, it seems useful for up to 10-20 people in the community to develop significant expertise across the relevant topics.</p>\n<p>For this reason, we recently began working with a part-time specialist advisor focused on China, who co-authored this post, and can provide one-on-on-one advice, introductions to others working in this area, and help finding funding.</p>\n<p>What follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span><span>Why is it important to understand China?</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>Which topics are most important to understand?</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>Why we don&apos;t want to do &quot;outreach&quot; in China.</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>How you can start a career in this area.</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>If you already have knowledge of China, what to do.&#xA0;</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>Who is a good fit for this option.</span></span></li>\n<li><span><span>How Russia and India compare.</span></span></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://80000hours.typeform.com/to/hgspaj?src=article__EAForum&amp;int_campaign=article__china-careers&amp;utm_campaign=article__china-careers\">Let us know</a> if you&apos;re interested in&#xA0;entering this path.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/china-careers/\">Read the full article.</a></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Benjamin_Todd"}}]
