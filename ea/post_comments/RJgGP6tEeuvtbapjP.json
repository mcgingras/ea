We are hosting a workshop on Friday to encourage this type of reflection (\"First-timers at EAGx\", at 3 pm UTC). You can also use <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZU0wZG9yGe5Wr3BEfoJpsvTUaJ_Xjr8fmKPBw5e8tOE/edit\">our planning worksheet</a>.</li><li>Group activities like watching talks together, in-person 1-1s, and shared lunch seem like good ideas!</li><li>It is better if space for 1-1s isn't packed very tight. It can be distracting when lots of people speaking around. And if two people are attending the same meetup or office hours they will hear each other speaking both in their headphones and in the room.</li></ul><p>We've already heard about multiple groups from different countries planning such co-attending sessions, it's exciting! I think it's especially valuable in regions with a lack of reliable infrastructure (e.g. where home internet is not reliable but it's possible to book a room at a local university or coworking with fiber internet).</p>", "parentCommentId": "abbXj8gLgnu7t8C3w", "user": {"username": "Alex_Berezhnoy"}}]
