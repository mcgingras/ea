Some benefits from fiscal sponsorship are much more predictable than others. Impact being one of the less predictable ones.</p><p>I <strong>agree strongly</strong> with the second sentence. I think it is part of any fiscal sponsor (and sponsees) due diligence to do that. Fiscal sponsorship relationships should be reassessed continually and with care. I think this <a href=\"https://www.arabellaadvisors.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/Fiscal-Sponsorship-White-Paper.pdf\">white paper </a>describes this very well.</p><blockquote><p>My guess is that this will show that having multiple large orgs share a legal structure is not worth it, but using sponsorship for short term projects or a launching pad will continue to make sense.</p></blockquote><p>This seems roughly right.

On priors, I think we should assume that there's a reasonable chance that the board had good reason to prevent this, and they're not just being evil. It's not obvious that more governance was bad in this case, compared to MacAskill doing what he thought was best (as a general process, even if you absolutely trust MacAskill in particular).</p><blockquote><p>it didn\u2019t raise any alarm bells for me when my first check from \u201cthe FTX Future Fund (regrantor program)\u201d came via CEA, and the second used the name North Dimensions.</p></blockquote><p>When someone accepts money from an ethically and legally dubious entity like a cryptocurrency exchange, I would be extremely surprised if the reaction would be different because they have interacted with fiscally sponsored projects in the past.
