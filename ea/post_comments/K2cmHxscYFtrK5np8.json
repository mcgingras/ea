For example, presumably this considers the funding gaps for specific programmes/countries that the likes of AMF are currently focusing on. But once that funding gap is filled, it seems plausible that there are other countries they could work on.<br><br>As an example, <a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/ImmediateFundingGap.aspx\">AMF currently state they have a funding gap of $53m</a> (vs less than $1m according to that GiveWell spreadsheet). They state that \"Agreements are being finalised with each country's Ministry of Health. This process is far advanced for the above programmes and we do not anticipate any issues. We do not publicly identify countries involved until an Agreement is signed\". It seems plausible that these countries are not included in GiveWell's figures.</p><p>Another possibility is that the funding gap on AMF's website is for programmes that will be implemented after 2023</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Matt_Sharp"}}, {"_id": "FgNaGi8aJhqZyshHK", "postedAt": "2021-11-13T19:49:01.927Z", "postId": "K2cmHxscYFtrK5np8", "htmlBody": "<p>I totally agree - I replied <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JamesOzOz/status/1458509889832095752\">something very similar</a> to Ben on Twitter.

I'm somewhat skeptical of this however as GiveWell don't mention anything about this in their <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/amf\">review of AMF</a> but really not sure at all. I would also love if someone from GiveWell or AMF could weigh in on this and clear this up!</p>", "parentCommentId": "n2DRu6smqCaRCqWAg", "user": {"username": "JamesOz"}}, {"_id": "3eoyqMw3wD8mJ7CdA", "postedAt": "2021-11-13T20:17:38.780Z", "postId": "K2cmHxscYFtrK5np8", "htmlBody": "<p>Also interesting: when I posted my tweet on the 10th (3 days ago) AMF had a listed funding gap of $74m and today (on the 13th) it's $54m!
