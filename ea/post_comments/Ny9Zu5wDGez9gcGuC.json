If it does, that\u2019s fine, but I\u2019m not sure this is the place for such simplistic and emotion-laden declarations.</p>\n<p>The reality is that war and conflict is a complicated and unfortunate fact of reality, and it\u2019s not very productive to just spout off random hatred against war. Furthermore, sometimes \u201cpeace\u201d might be worse than war. In the Civil War, should the North have simply let the South secede and continue the barbaric practice of slavery? Should the UK have just thrown down their arms when Hitler invaded, or when he was gassing Jewish people?</p>\n<p>If you\u2019ve been personally affected by war I can understand that you might have a lot of emotions, but to be brutally honest, the degree of thoughtfulness in this declaration is on par with young children; many people I know have come to understand that the world is not so black and white by middle or at least high school.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Harrison D"}}]
