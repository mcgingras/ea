Nonlinear was the first (and currently only) EA org I\u2019ve interned at.</p><p>Nonlinear had formally stopped hiring interns when I applied, due to the incidents mentioned above. I contributed to the Superlinear bounty platform as a remote volunteer, without knowing it was owned by Nonlinear, or what Nonlinear was. I had spent so much time trying to contribute to EA part-time, that I wanted to make the experience easier for others.</p><p>When I was hired as an intern, I texted my friend \u201c<i>What\u2019s Nonlinear? Are they \u2026 like, a big deal?\u201d.</i> My friend explained that having Nonlinear as a reference would help me gain admission to EA conferences, and be taken seriously for EA job applications.</p><p>Now that Nonlinear\u2019s reputation within EA has been seriously harmed, I\u2019ve been very concerned about how this affects my ability to contribute within EA. Should I add Nonlinear/Kat as references and risk very negative associations, or omit them and risk being overlooked in favour of other applicants who do have references from prominent EAs? It means a lot to me because, as a non-US/EU/UK citizen, I know I\u2019m always applying at a significant disadvantage.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6hkodzdmtu2\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6hkodzdmtu2\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I will always have fewer opportunities than an EA born in London who goes to a prestigious UK college with an active EA chapter and many EA internship options, who doesn\u2019t have additional Visa requirements.

However, I think this is conditional on the people in question acknowledging that something went wrong and being willing to learn from it.</p><p>I wish there was more reflection and apologising in your post. Just blaming the EA community for assuming ill-intent too often and spending all your energy on debunking as many claims as possible gives the impression that you're not really taking responsibility for the situation. It seems pretty clear to me that working and living together (especially when going to lots of new places where you don't have an existing support system) does create a lot of dependence and makes it more likely for your employees to feel stripped of their agency. I think a lot of the things that I find icky from Ben's post and that still feel icky to me have to do with this dynamic of completely blurred professional and personal boundaries.

It sounds like some people interpreted it differently, but I thought the point of the section was quite clear (to me, anyway) based on this part of it: \"However, this is completely unfair to Ben.

Providing evidence to an investigator takes way less time than doing a full write-up for the EA forum.<br><br>(3) I didn't do a detailed look at every row in the \"Short summary overview table\", but for the ones I did look into in more detail, I found Nonlinear's counter evidence to be compelling.

In particular, I'd say:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The photos provide a bit of information, but can be viewed as distracting and misleading. I think the value of information they provide is probably sufficient for their inclusion in a linked Google Doc, but including them twice in the post (and once near the top) gives them a lot of salience, and as some of the comments here show, this can cause some readers to switch off or view your post with hostility.</li>\n<li>Some of the alternative hypothesis stuff, and the stuff related to claims about Ben Pace, may also have been better suited to a linked Google Doc -- something that curious readers could dig into, but that was not given a lot of salience for somebody who was just interested in the core claims. I think there's some value to these exercises, but it would muddy the waters less if this were less salient, so that readers could focus on the core claims.</li>\n<li>Some of the editorialization e.g., around what we should be focusing on, or how much effort was wasted on this, would probably have been best left to a follow-up post, <em>if</em> and <em>after</em> the core claims of this post achieved more widespread acceptance.

This has destroyed their reputation in EA, and been catastrophic to the org, in a way that they consider ill-deserved. They want to write a post to clear their name. They were very emotionally hurt by this, and extremely reasonably! \"Alice, Ben, and Chloe hurt me (Kat) so much I couldn\u2019t sleep, I couldn\u2019t eat, and I cried more than any other time in my life.

Plus, idk, most people won't read exhaustive evidence (I expect few readers of this post are reading the long attached doc!) Attacking the credibility of your attackers seems one of the few ways of getting out of that. I further think that, if the list of false allegations Nonlinear gives are truly false, Alice and Chloe really aren't that credible, made some extremely serious and false allegations, and their overall credibility is a really important part of evaluating this story! And justifies a pretty forceful attack on them.</p><p>If we live in world C then \"I don't see many places where you admit to making mistakes and it doesn't seem like you're willing to take ownership of this situation at all.\" doesn't really make sense.</p><p>Of course, if we live in world A, then Nonlinear are getting rightfully criticised and are fighting dirty against whistleblowers.

Obviously the document could not be super-specific without knowledge of exactly what allegations would be made or exactly how they would be worded, but going by what Kat suggests in the post, the approximate list of concerns that the former employees were raising was already known to Nonlinear. (In fact, I'd go further and say they should have focus-grouped or otherwise gotten feedback on their responses so as to understand how others might perceive things). Having a document like this prepared before there was a PR crisis would have helped in several ways:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Nonlinear staff (Kat and others) could have gotten over some of the emotional edge that one has when first confronting accusations, or putting one's response to accusations on paper, which may have improved the quality of their communication, reducing the risk of them appearing defensive or otherwise sending out signals of poor epistemic virtue.</li>\n<li>Nonlinear could have proactively provided the proofs to Ben without requesting him to wait a week for them to collect proofs, because <em>the proofs would have been ready</em>.</li>\n<li>Even if Ben had not been willing or able to review all of these, Nonlinear could have published its response relatively more quickly after Ben's post was published. The 3-month-plus delay likely cost a lot to Nonlinear's reputation.</li>\n<li>Having a substantive response may also have reduced the chances that Nonlinear would resort to approaches such as legal threats, that (in my view) did not succeed, and rather ended up backfiring for Nonlinear in the court of public opinion.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>My suggestion would have been to purely prepare the document defensively, only to be published if the accusations gained wider credence, but potentially the document could also be shared with funders, grantees, potential employees, or other stakeholders who had already heard the accusations and were concerned about associating with Nonlinear due to the accusations.</p>\n<p>I think many of the same factors that led to a lot of the problems in the first place likely also constrained Nonlinear's ability to preemptively respond to the problems, namely: not a lot of manpower, not a lot of internal organization, always being on the move, etc. I think it could still be a valuable lesson for other individuals or organizations to consider when they come to learn that there is negative information about them that's floating around.</p>\n<p>Preemptively responding to a threat that may never materialize may mean wasted effort. But then again, a lot of the whole existential risk / catastrophic risk / AI safety community is focused on preemptively responding to things that may not materialize. So I don't think that's much of an objection in principle. It comes down partly to how high the probability is, but it's worth keeping in mind the other angle: once the threat has materialized, it's much harder to respond in a level-headed manner.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "vipulnaik"}}, {"_id": "dDD7WmNS76ojhHjMD", "postedAt": "2023-12-12T23:31:37.187Z", "postId": "H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC", "htmlBody": "<p>I think it is too early to make a call on whether Ben could have done a better job fact-checking things.

The fact that Ben included the information in his post shows that he didn't intend to hide it; nonetheless, my sense is that he didn't highlight it as a disclosure / disclaimer / caveat for readers to keep in mind when interpreting the post. He did include other disclaimers around his process and motivation at the start of the post, that I found helpful, and his non-inclusion of payment along with those disclosures gives me the sense that he didn't consider the distortionary effect of payment as a biasing factor worth highlighting to readers. My guess is that it would be pretty likely for readers to miss it (as I did).

Is  it maybe possible that Emerson's initial reply had little else besides \"Some points still require clarification,\" and Emerson only later conveyed how strongly he disagreed with the overall summary once he realized that Ben was basically set on publishing on a 2h notice? If so, that's very different from Ben being told in the very first email reply that Nonlinear's stance on this is basically \"good summary, but also dozens of claims are completely false and we can document that.\" That's such a stark difference, so it feels to me like there was miscommunication going on.)</p>\n<p>At the same time:</p>\n<p>(2) I still find Chloe's broad perspective credible and concerning (in a \"this is difficult work environment with definite potential for toxicity\" rather than \"this is outright abusive on all reasonable definitions of the word\"). The replies by Nonlinear leadership didn't change my initial opinion here by too much because there are features of how Kat and Emerson are presenting their side of things that make me think \"ah, I see it: not surprised Chloe felt negative emotions about her perceived standing in relation to them.\" (Admittedly, I think if I applied more charitable priors here, I could see alternative explanations like \"the negative features I believe I see here are best explained by Kat and Emerson feeling hurt and upset by things Chloe said, so they come across as defensive and one-sided in return, but they'd be better able to see and re-state Chloe's perspective if they were more distanced from the events, and may have been better at seeing Chloe's perspective earlier, before they all had a falling out.\")</p>\n<p>To elaborate on (1):</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If Nonlinear's description of Alice is even halfway accurate, then I feel like Ben should have decided not to air any of her claims altogether, and only gone with Chloe as the single source. This would have made clear that the picture is one of mostly just one person. This would probably have changed the forcefulness of the post by quite a bit, which would've been less immediately condemning towards Nonlinear (making the resulting discussion fairer).</li>\n<li>I also thought some of the replies Nonlinear gave towards Chloe seemed more persuasive than I would've expected. (At the same time, I think many of their replies seemed roughly what I would have expected, and in fact seem arguably revealing to me in some ways \u2013&nbsp;see my point below on \"(2).\" [I guess the people who disagree with me will think I'm still influenced by the priors I've formed from the previous discussion, and that it's hard to be objective after having initially formed a negative-leaning view.])</li>\n</ul>\n<p>To elaborate on (2)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I didn't like the repeated mentions of phrases like \"this would have been your dream day!\" or \"to many [...], this would have been their dream job!.\" Sure, I get where this is coming from: Contrasted with accusations of not feeding people well or not paying them enough money, it makes sense to highlight that the role had lots of perks. At the same time, the lengths to which they went to highlight this, and the talk about hanging out with other high-status community heroes, gave me too much of a feeling that they almost expected Chloe and Alice to feel indebted towards them. I can see how this attitude would lead to difficult dynamics in a setting where you're co-living and forming \"what-can-feel-like-friendships\" with people you also expect to do all sorts of tasks for you.</li>\n<li>Relatedly, it's begging the question to self-describe your group with \"Your group has a really optimistic and warm vibe. There\u2019s this sense in the group that anything is possible if you are just creative, brave, and never give up. It feels really empowering and inspiring.\" It's fair if Kat or Emerson perceived their group that way, but, evidently, Chloe felt very different about it. So, it feels like it's not hearing her perspective when they describe things like that. This is a strange disconnect. (As another commenter pointed out, there's a similar disconnect with posting the pictures of social fun and tropic scenery, without at least pointing out that it's not actually what most of the discussion was about. I get the desire to share pictures, fwiw, but I think this could've been embedded with a framing that acknowledges the disconnect issue.)\n(Also relatedly: On \"warm vibes,\" I'm remembering some of the screenshots in the food-ordering discussion made me feel like \"I can see why Chloe wouldn't necessarily feel like they're being super warm towards her.\" Not in a way that's too bad or anything, but, Idk, something about how much value is put on productivity and the ability to negotiate, as opposed to, e.g., going out of one's way to make sure Chloe feels comfortable voicing whenever she struggles with something or needs something when she's sick or feeling low. [I'm not claiming that all employers need to be particularly warm or proactive about encouraging their employees to become better at asking for their basic needs to be met; I'm just pointing out that it's problematic if there's a mismatch between self-perceived warmth vibes and actual effect one has on others, combined with risky work setups like isolated travels and co-working with people who do tasks for you, and blurring potential-for-friendship and professional interactions.]) Overall, there just feels like too little engagement with the possibility that Chloe's experience was maybe predictable and not out of the ordinary, i.e., that Chloe wasn't entitled or disgruntled to react the way she did.</li>\n<li>I thought some of the short-summary replies to Chloe seemed uncharitable to the point of being mean. For instance, this part: \"CHLOE: I had unclear work boundaries and was pressured into working on a weekend (implies this was a regular occurrence). NONLINEAR: \"My boss offered me an all-expenses-paid trip to the Caribbean island St. Barths, which required one hour of work to arrange the boat and ATV rentals (for me to enjoy too). But it was one hour on a weekend, so I complained, and it never happened again.\" I remember reading Chloe's account of this incident and it felt very different to me. When I read Chloe's account, I could easily see where she was coming from. I admit that it's okay to use hyperbole in a summary. Maybe they thought it's okay because everyone can see that this is meant somewhat hyperbolically. However, the following is a case where it's more unambiguously mean-spirited rather than just hyperbolic: \"Complex situations she herself cites: ordering a taxi, asking for a ride, packing suitcases. [...] This is some of the best public evidence of her being mentally unwell. These are not overwhelming tasks for most people.\" I feel like this is very unfair. Having read Chloe's descriptions, I'd say it fails to engage with what makes these things complicated (people having various strong preferences about specifics related to the tasks, and you have juggle all of them and make everyone happy, while taking care of other constraints + brain fog from having worked too much before the weekend you're supposed to have off).</li>\n<li>\"So how do we learn from this to make our community better? How can we make EA antifragile?\" Maybe this is a minor point, but I don't like this style of \"writing things as though it's now conclusively established that Ben and Chloe were in the wrong, so we can move on to lessons learned given that specific conclusion.\" It feels premature. I also didn't like this part: \"I wish I could think that Alice, Ben, and Chloe were villains.\" Ben and Chloe get tainted by association with Alice. The points made by Nonlinear against Alice are way more concerning-if-true than the points made against Chloe or Ben. (I'm not sure about the degree to which they are contested because some of it goes well beyond earlier things that were said about Alice, and people who know more context about Alice, which doesn't describe me at all, haven't had the chance to comment on this.)</li>\n<li>Overall, I thought it's simply implausible that the most Nonlinear leadership could come up with in terms of \"things we could've done differently\" (see their appendix on this) is stuff like \"Emerson shouldn't have snapped at Chloe during that one stressful day\" or \"we shouldn't have have lived together with employees who weren't previously assistants because, apparently, such employees cannot handle it and will think we're friends.\" (I'm being admittedly a bit unfair/hyperbolic here; also, note that there were like two or three other short items.) To be more fair, I realize that when you're faced with lots of false accusations (and I agree many of the claims now seem dubious to me and probably uncalled for!), it's understandable to focus mostly on defending yourself and on highlighting how outrageous everything is. However, I think there are several reasons to also focus a lot on what one could've done better. One: I think there's almost always something one can learn from conflicts, even if one is genuinely 98% percent in the right and dealing with a person who has an unhealthy relationship to their own negative emotions that turn them into a wrecking ball of toxicity. Secondly, it's sometimes hard to be right about things like that, so one kind of has a duty, when \"fighting back,\" to make sure one isn't the one \"in the wrong\" rationalizing one's negative perspective of the other party. Thirdly, and very related to the previous point, I feel like pointing out what one could've done differently is some of the more reliable types of evidence one can readily give in favor of not being someone who looks at things in a  one-sided and distorted fashion. So, even if this is just about making sure one's defense is credible, it's strategically smart to inspect and point out what didn't go well. Lastly, I noticed that the post and appendix by Nonlinear is quite well-written in terms of persuasive rhetoric across a number of dimensions, which makes me think that them not including a more comprehensive takeaways/\"lessons learned\" section is unlikely to be a simple strategic mistake (not realizing that this sort of thing is something that readers in the audience would look out for). Instead, it feels like maybe more a genuine display of their belief that they're close to infallible. If this is the case, it's easy to see why this attitude increases the potential for things to not go well interpersonally.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even though many the things in my elaboration of \"(2)\" are negative about Nonlinear, I want to emphasize again that this post made me update positively about them and that I think it's unfortunate how the initial presentation and resulting discussion was too one-sided. I appreciate the length of this post; it must have been very stressful and anxiety-inducing to feel compelled to write it. (I'm overall inclined to think that it was positive for them/their reputation to write it.)</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Lukas_Gloor"}}, {"_id": "eXhHWTwB2vJaQtmu4", "postedAt": "2023-12-13T02:15:37.290Z", "postId": "H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC", "htmlBody": "<p>Sometimes, it is not enough to make a point theoretically, it has to be made in practice.

If the gun-wielder then goes around saying that \u201cyou hit them\u201d they\u2019re missing a&nbsp;<i>critical&nbsp;</i>detail in the story.</p><p>Ben&nbsp;<i>knowingly</i> published numerous falsehoods that were extremely damaging to us. He published dozens&nbsp;<i>more&nbsp;</i>libelous falsehoods from Alice and Chloe which he could have easily avoided if he\u2019d just looked at the evidence. He knew he was about to wreck our ability to do good and cause immense personal suffering to us.</p><p><strong>He heard somebody - who has a reputation for dishonesty - yell \u201cthief!\u201d and shot us in the stomach before he could check and see if we were actually thieves.</strong> He was unwise and reckless. You shouldn\u2019t shoot people that easily. Especially when you&nbsp;<i>know</i> that the person yelling it has told you lies before. But he was well-intentioned nonetheless.</p><p>And even as Ben proudly says he\u2019d shoot us again, we\u2019re saying that the real villain is unaligned AI and let\u2019s focus on that. We should not be fighting each other. We don\u2019t want to fight.&nbsp;</p><p>Ben, we\u2019re on the same side. We all want to make AI go well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You were misled. By women who need help and compassion, no doubt. But the way to help them isn\u2019t to shoot us.</strong> It\u2019s to actually try to understand the situation, then go from there.&nbsp;</p><p>Remember: the way that good people do bad things is to demonize the other. So even if some of you might be very mad at Ben for doing this, I call on everybody to try to be their best selves. To set off an upward spiral. To remember that Ben had good intentions. His methods were bad and the outcomes disastrous, but the way to solve that is not to shoot him. The way to solve it is to creatively problem-solve, assume good intent, and remember the bigger picture.&nbsp;</p><p>To always remember:</p><p><br>Almost nobody is evil</p><p>Almost everything is broken</p><p>Almost everything is fixable</p></blockquote><p>And the accusation of threatening to hire stalkers is just a really weird accusation. That should be an indicator that somebody is not mentally alright.&nbsp;</p><p>I'm really sad too that we couldn't just talk too. I hope we still might be able to, once you've read the document and see that the retaliation reputation was unwarranted. I would really love to talk. I think trying to do conflict resolution in a high stakes, hostile, and public venue is less likely to work than if we can talk face-to-face and have a higher bandwidth conversation.&nbsp;</p><p>Honestly, I wish we'd already invented mind reading technology, because I'd just let you read my mind, unfiltered. I know that if you could, you'd see that I really have no negative intentions and I'm really just trying to figure out how to make everybody happy and reduce suffering. This situation is complicated and I certainly can sometimes unintentially cause harm, and I hate that, and I'm always working on trying to prevent that. But I really do just want everybody to be happy, including you. Anyways, for now we don't have mind-reading technology that's accurate or cheap enough, so we'll have to make do with me trying to convey through text that I really am not retaliatory. If you hurt me, I will try to understand you, try to help you understand me, then try to collaboratively problem-solve.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "kbckHWjNkTLBLsPax", "user": {"username": "katherinesavoie"}}, {"_id": "vGL4RMCy2CFuH4ebf", "postedAt": "2023-12-13T02:53:19.632Z", "postId": "H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC", "htmlBody": "<p>I agree with this though it is unfortunately much the same in lots of longtermism/AI safety.

Ultimately, if this post chooses to adopt certain rhetorical tactics (for good or bad), I think Kat and the Nonlinear term do need to take responsibility for these tactics. And to my understanding, they have -- for instance, in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims?commentId=MoJH3cPC5wWFJ4hSx\">this comment</a> Kat says that some of the controversial decisions around inclusion of stuff in the post were things that the team discussed and decided on.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "iXwRZTXNSj9vJoqSG", "user": {"username": "vipulnaik"}}, {"_id": "TwzuoXEdopP8MvL3D", "postedAt": "2023-12-13T07:24:56.389Z", "postId": "H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC", "htmlBody": "<p>I agree with this. I think overall I get a sense that Kat responded in just the sort of manner that Alice and Chloe feared*, and that the <i>flavor of treatment</i> that Alice and Chloe (as told by Ben) said they experienced from Kat/Emerson seems to be on display here. (* Edit: I mean, Kat could've done worse, but it wouldn't help <i>her</i>/Nonlinear.)</p><p>I also feel like Kat is misrepresenting Ben's article? For example, Kat says</p><blockquote><p>Chloe claimed: they tricked me by refusing to write down my compensation agreement</p></blockquote><p>I just read that article and don't remember any statement to that affect, and searching for individual words in this sentence didn't lead me to a similar sentence in Ben's article on in Chloe's <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH/sharing-information-about-nonlinear?commentId=gvjKdRaRaggRrxFjH\">followup</a>. I think the closest thing is this part:</p><blockquote><p>Chloe\u2019s salary was verbally agreed to come out to around $75k/year. However, she was only paid $1k/month, and otherwise had many basic things compensated i.e. rent, groceries, travel. This was supposed to make traveling together easier, and supposed to come out to the same salary level. While Emerson did compensate Alice and Chloe with food and board and travel, Chloe does not believe that she was compensated to an amount equivalent to the salary discussed, and I believe no accounting was done for either Alice or Chloe to ensure that any salary matched up. (I\u2019ve done some spot-checks of the costs of their AirBnbs and travel, and Alice/Chloe\u2019s epistemic state seems pretty reasonable to me.)</p></blockquote><p>I, too, was mentally tallying up benefits. Plane tickets, hotel fees and other perks might be that costly, but the business <i>required</i> her to travel so it seems like we shouldn't treat it dollar-for-dollar like normal compensation.</p><p>More importantly I feel like there's misdirection. Chloe's claim was that a verbal agreement existed and wasn't fully upheld; <strong>Kat rewrites this into a different claim, then labels it \"False.\"</strong></p><p>No, you don't get to do this. When your reputation is on the line and you're being scrutinized, I expect you to be on your best behavior.</p><ul><li>Ben's article draws a sharp distinction between the reputations of Alice and Chloe, but Kat's article lumps them together as \"Alice/Chloe\" 27 times (tbf, Ben also groups them about 19 times, but Kat's lumping seems less appropriate to me, on average)</li><li>Kat says there were 21 Nonlinear employees but Ben refers to \"their two in-person employees\" as if there are <i>only</i> two plus Kat, Emerson and Drew. I assume the difference is made up by remote and former employees. But if Alice and Chloe were the <i>only</i> two in-person employees and had no relation to each other, Kat's implication that they <i>both</i> lied or (in Chloe's case) gave misleading accounts would be surprising if true.</li></ul><p>Kat, if you're reading this\u2015I think you mean well, and my charitable reading is that (1) you are a proper EA at heart, (2) you have social skills but also some bad social habits, and (3) you wrote this from an emotional place that compromised your objectivity, which caused you to choose a highly defensive PR strategy in which you exaggerated the positions of Ben/Alice/Chloe in order to make them sound less reasonable. (Edit: or rather, to make their positions easier to refute. And let's keep in mind that Ben did a \"search for negative information\" and did not build a \"balanced case\".)</p><p>I might let that slide if it was just one employee who had a bad experience at every previous job, but there were two, plus Ben's judgement and \"many\" anonymous sources. Plus, I agree with Ben that the policy \"I don\u2019t say bad things about you, you don\u2019t say bad things about me\" is not a good policy; \"I speak charitably of you, you speak charitably of me\" is the most I think one could reasonably ask for. So what you <i>needed</i> to do was reflect upon what mistakes you and Emerson made, and what you can do to begin to repair your reputations (e.g. recognize faults and apologize), and then do that. I wonder if you're so convinced of your own innocence that you can't see that the red flags that were discussed were actually red....</p><p>Kat reworded <strong>every</strong> claim made by Alice/Chloe/Ben, so I checked a few more:</p><ul><li>Kat says \"Alice/Chloe claimed Nonlinear failed to pay them. Later, they denied ever claiming this.\" Now I'm <i>really</i> confused, like, did Ben publish more than one article? <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH/sharing-information-about-nonlinear\">The one I read</a> didn't make it sound like that. It did indicate that Alice may have communicated poorly or deceptively (\"catastrophic miscommunications\", Kat reportedly said), but I can't find any claim <i>from Chloe</i> about not being paid.</li><li>Kat said \"Chloe claimed: they told me not to spend time with my romantic partner\". It does seem a bit odd that Ben's article doesn't mention Chloe's romantic partner being there for two months, since it <i>does</i> say \"Alice and Chloe report that they were advised not to spend time with \u2018low value people\u2019, including their families, romantic partners, and anyone local to where they were staying, with the exception of guests/visitors that Nonlinear invited.\" But since this part is a <i>combination</i> of what Alice and Chloe said, it's not strictly accurate to say \"<i>Chloe</i> claimed she was advised not to spend time with her romantic partner\", or to say \"told\" (which sounds like an order) rather than \"advised\".</li><li>Kat said that Chloe said \"I felt like they didn\u2019t value me or my time\". I can't find any statement to that effect in Ben's article or Chloe's big comment, but it did remind me of something: \"Alice reported that she would get these compliments near-daily. She eventually had the sense that this was said in order to get something out of her. She reported that one time, after a series of such compliments, the Kat Woods then turned and recorded a near-identical series of compliments into their phone for a different person.\" Kat's response was basically that Nonlinear was generous and that \"Kat showed so much gratitude that Chloe actually asked her to <i>stop</i> expressing gratitude\". But after what Alice said, I feel like Kat may have missed the point of whatever the paraphrase \"they didn\u2019t value me\" was intended to refer to.</li><li>Kat said that Alice said that \"Kat threatened my career for telling the truth\". There is a similar clause in Ben's article, but it comes across differently: \"Kat Woods\u2019 texts that read to me [Ben] as a veiled threat to destroy someone\u2019s career for sharing negative information about her.\"</li><li>Kat refers to \"Ben\u2019s hypothesis - 2 EAs are Secretly Evil\". I don't think that's accurate (edit: but Kat likely does see it this way.)</li></ul>", "parentCommentId": "7YxPKCW3nCwWn2swb", "user": {"username": "dpiepgrass"}}, {"_id": "wSYAFtG9b4KhYSwch", "postedAt": "2023-12-13T08:46:13.318Z", "postId": "H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC", "htmlBody": "<p>(No, that is very inaccurate)&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "ZbcRh8scurGmGWpCS", "user": {"username": "Habryka"}}, {"_id": "4Rq6sDoAAiFypSpHw", "postedAt": "2023-12-13T09:42:02.097Z", "postId": "H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC", "htmlBody": "<p><br>I won't comment on who is right and who is wrong.

How a whole movement pays the PR price of the luxury lifestyle of a few? How this is plainly in contradiction with principles of effective altruism and nobody says anything because I assume the funder and the causes are hyped?

Alice and Chloe report this made them very socially dependent on Kat/Emerson/Drew and otherwise very isolated.</p></blockquote><p>There aren't any other details in the original post specifically from Chloe or specifically about her partner, including in the comment in Chloe's words below the post. The only specific detail about romantic partners I see in the original post is about Alice, and it plausibly fits the \"romantic partners\" piece of this summary. (\"Alice was polyamorous, and she and Drew entered into a casual romantic relationship. Kat previously had a polyamorous marriage that ended in divorce, and is now monogamously partnered with Emerson. Kat reportedly told Alice that she didn't mind polyamory \"on the other side of the world\u201d, but couldn't stand it right next to her, and probably either Alice would need to become monogamous or Alice should leave the organization.\")</p><p>Both links in the summary table go to the same place, which says:</p><blockquote><h2>Chloe says: \u201cThey told me not to spend time with my boyfriend so I was kept socially dependent\u201d, yet we invited her boyfriend to live with us (rent-free) for 2 of the 5 months, discrediting her as a reliable source of truth</h2></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>False, Questionable, or Misleading Claim:&nbsp;</strong>Alice and Chloe report that they were advised not to spend time with \u2018low value people\u2019, including their families,&nbsp;<strong>romantic partners\u2026</strong></p><p><strong>The Other Side:</strong> Simply a sad, unbelievable lie given how easily refutable it is.&nbsp;</p><p>In direct contradiction to this, Chloe\u2019s boyfriend traveled with us 40% of the time! (~2 of the 5 months she was with us) We thought he was wonderful, had high potential, and we even considered inviting him to join us indefinitely! Emerson also helped her boyfriend financially for part of the time by not charging him for rent/groceries</p><p>[cropped phone screenshots of text conversations from February and May 2022, respectively, with the description \"<i>LEFT: Kat and Emerson discuss whether they should let Chloe\u2019s boyfriend stay with them longer.

He just wanted the highest quality people exchanging ideas to maximize impact in beautiful places.</p></blockquote><p>As far as I can tell, \"They told me not to spend time with my boyfriend so I was kept socially dependent\" is not a direct quote or paraphrase. (Maybe I'd use ~tildes~ for a device like this.) Rather, it picks out one possible contributor to Ben's summary paragraph.</p><p>Taking the screenshots at face value, they establish that as of February, Kat and Emerson thought Chloe's boyfriend might have high enough potential for an extended invite (Emerson: \"i'm open to it\" \"he seems eager to help build shit\"), and as of May, Kat was not telling Chloe not to spend time with him. (Chloe was with Nonlinear from January to July.)</p><p>From my perspective, this is between \"not responsive to the complaint\" and \"evidence for the spirit of the complaint\". It seems an overreach to call \"They told me not to spend time with my boyfriend...\" a \"sad, unbelievable lie\" \"discrediting [Chloe] as a reliable source of truth\" when it is not something anyone has cited Chloe as saying. It seems incorrect to describe \"advised not to spend time with 'low value people'\" as in \"direct contradiction\" with any of this, which instead seems to affirm that traveling with Nonlinear was conditioned on \"high potential\" or being among the \"highest quality people\". Finally, having initially considered inviting Chloe's boyfriend to travel with them would still be entirely consistent with later deciding not to; encouraging a visit in May would still be consistent with an overall expectation that Chloe not spend too much time with her boyfriend in general for reasons related to his perceived \"quality\".</p><p>Edit: the summary table also says \u201cWe were just about to invite him to travel with us indefinitely because it would make Chloe happy, but then Chloe quit [in July].\u201d This would fit with not inviting him in February and later being reluctant for \u201cquality\u201d reasons.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Muireall"}}, {"_id": "x5P4Henb3C76au4N6", "postedAt": "2023-12-13T15:27:06.771Z", "postId": "H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC", "htmlBody": "<p>[Third edit to add my current position on 22/12/23]<br><br>I said below that I would read the arguments from both sides and then make a final decision.

I think it would have been reasonable for Ben to give Nonlinear, say, exactly one week to provide the evidence they wanted with a promise to read/review it and decide if he felt it was worthwhile to edit the post before publishing.</p></blockquote><p>I will again link to my original comments on this issue:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>I don\u2019t have all the context of Ben\u2019s investigation here, but as someone who has done investigations like this in the past, here are some thoughts on why I don\u2019t feel super sympathetic to requests to delay publication:</p><p>In this case, it seems to me that there is a large and substantial threat of retaliation. My guess is Ben\u2019s sources were worried about Emerson hiring stalkers, calling their family, trying to get them fired from their job, or threatening legal action. Having things be out in the public can provide a defense because it is much easier to ask for help if the conflict happens in the open.</p><p>As a concrete example, Emerson has just sent me an email saying:</p><blockquote><p>Given the irreversible damage that would occur by publishing, it simply is inexcusable to not give us a bit of time to correct the libelous falsehoods in this document, and if published as is we intend to pursue legal action for libel against Ben Pace personally and Lightcone for the maximum damages permitted by law. The legal case is unambiguous and publishing it now would both be unethical and gross negligence, causing irreversible damage.</p></blockquote><p>For the record, the threat of libel suit and use of statements like \u201cmaximum damages permitted by law\u201d seem to me to be attempts at intimidation. Also, as someone who has looked quite a lot into libel law (having been threatened with libel suits many times over the years), describing the legal case as \u201cunambiguous\u201d seems inaccurate and a further attempt at intimidation.</p><p>My guess is Ben\u2019s sources have also received dozens of calls (as have I received many in the last few hours), and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised to hear that Emerson called up my board, or would otherwise try to find some other piece of leverage against Lightcone, Ben, or Ben\u2019s sources if he had more time.</p><p>While I am not that worried about Emerson, I think many other people are in a much more vulnerable position and I can really resonate with not wanting to give someone an opportunity to gather their forces (and in that case I think it\u2019s reasonable to force the conflict out in the open, which is far from an ideal arena, but does provide protection against many types of threats and adversarial action).</p><p>Separately, the time investment for things like this is really quite enormous and I have found it extremely hard to do work of this type in parallel to other kinds of work, especially towards the end of a project like this, when the information is ready for sharing, and lots of people have strong opinions and try to pressure you in various ways. Delaying by \u201cjust a week\u201d probably translates into roughly 40 hours of productive time lost, even if there isn\u2019t much to do, because it\u2019s so hard to focus on other things. That\u2019s just a lot of additional time, and so it\u2019s not actually a very cheap ask.</p><p>Lastly, I have also found that the standard way that abuse in the extended EA community has been successfully prevented from being discovered is by forcing everyone who wants to publicize or share any information about it to jump through a large number of hoops. Calls for \u201cjust wait a week\u201d and \u201cjust run your posts by the party you are criticizing\u201d might sound reasonable in isolation, but very quickly multiply the cost of any information sharing, and have huge chilling effects that prevent the publishing of most information and accusations. Asking the other party to just keep doing a lot of due diligence is easy and successful and keeps most people away from doing investigations like this.</p><p>As I have written about before, I myself ended up being intimidated by this for the case of FTX and chose not to share my concerns about FTX more widely, which I continue to consider one of the worst mistakes of my career.</p><p>My current guess is that if it is indeed the case that Emerson and Kat have clear proof that a lot of the information in this post is false, then I think they should share that information publicly. Maybe on their own blog, or maybe here on LessWrong or on the EA Forum. It is also the case that rumors about people having had very bad experiences working with Nonlinear are already circulating around the community and this is already having a large effect on Nonlinear, and as such, being able to have clear false accusations to respond against should help them clear their name, if they are indeed false.</p><p>I agree that this kind of post can be costly, and I don\u2019t want to ignore the potential costs of false accusations, but at least to me it seems like I want an equilibrium of substantially more information sharing, and to put more trust in people\u2019s ability to update their models of what is going on, and less paternalistic \u201cpeople are incapable of updating if we present proof that the accusations are false\u201d, especially given what happened with FTX and the costs we have observed from failing to share observations like this.</p><p>A final point that feels a bit harder to communicate is that in my experience, some people are just really good at manipulation, throwing you off-balance, and distorting your view of reality, and this is a strong reason to not commit to run everything by the people you are sharing information on. A common theme that I remember hearing from people who had concerns about SBF is that people intended to warn other people, or share information, then they talked to SBF, and somehow during that conversation he disarmed them, without really responding to the essence of their concerns. This can take the form of threats and intimidation, or the form of just being really charismatic and making you forget what your concerns were, or more deeply ripping away your grounding and making you think that your concerns aren\u2019t real, and that actually everyone is doing the thing that seems wrong to you, and you are going to out yourself as naive and gullible by sharing your perspective.</p><p>[Edit: The closest post we have to setting norms on when to share information with orgs you are criticizing is Jeff Kauffman\u2019s <a href=\"https://ea.greaterwrong.com/posts/f77iuXmgiiFgurnBu/run-posts-by-orgs\">post</a> on the matter. While I don\u2019t fully agree with the reasoning within it, in there he says:</p><blockquote><p>Sometimes orgs will respond with requests for changes, or try to engage you in private back-and forth. While you\u2019re welcome to make edits in response to what you learn from them, you don\u2019t have an obligation to: it\u2019s fine to just say \u201cI\u2019m planning to publish this as-is, and I\u2019d be happy to discuss your concerns publicly in the comments.\u201d<br><br>[EDIT: I\u2019m not advocating this for cases where you\u2019re worried that the org will retaliate or otherwise behave badly if you give them advance warning, or for cases where you\u2019ve had a bad experience with an org and don\u2019t want any further interaction. For example, I expect Curzi didn\u2019t give Leverage an opportunity to prepare a response to My Experience with Leverage Research, and that\u2019s fine.]</p></blockquote><p>This case seems to me to be fairly clearly covered by the second paragraph, and also, Nonlinear\u2019s response to \u201cI am happy to discuss your concerns publicly in the comments\u201d was to respond with \u201cI will sue you if you publish these concerns\u201d, to which IMO the reasonable response is to just go ahead and publish before things escalate further. Separately, my sense is Ben\u2019s sources really didn\u2019t want any further interaction and really preferred having this over with, which I resonate with, and is also explicitly covered by Jeff\u2019s post.</p><p>So in as much as you are trying to enforce some kind of existing norm that demands running posts like this by the org, I don\u2019t think that norm currently has widespread buy-in, as the most popular and widely-quoted post on the topic does not demand that standard (I separately think the post is still slightly too much in favor of running posts by the organizations they are criticizing, but that\u2019s for a different debate).]</p></blockquote><p>I think there are a few different types of updates to make from this post, but I don't think Nonlinear has provided any evidence that they are unlikely to retaliate (and indeed, the degree to which past employees seemed threatened into not sharing any negative information about Nonlinear was my biggest warning flag about the organization). I think one of the central criticisms of this post in the comments is the degree to which it does seem optimized to retaliate.&nbsp;</p><p>The threats of retaliation were straightforwardly the central reason why we didn't delay publishing, and I still stand by that decision. If you want me or Ben to do something else in the future, please give me an alternative that prevents undue threats of retaliation. We had talked to Nonlinear and did try to integrate the things they said as best as we can into the post, which like, included a whole section that did indeed argue against various parts that Alice and Chloe said.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "ncWaxmpcEWjBRfjCM", "user": {"username": "Habryka"}}, {"_id": "RKSfRsvcBDHKGdDAH", "postedAt": "2023-12-13T18:30:11.892Z", "postId": "H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC", "htmlBody": "<p>This is a really good comment.

To save you time and having to hop on many long rambly calls, let's do this: in the next week we will prepare a detailed doc of claims and evidence which should be thorough enough to answer all your questions in a single call. In the meantime, feel free to add any more questions that you'd like answered that weren't in your original list.

(I generated a random number between 1 and 135.)</p><p>This page is split between two sections. The first starts on page 114:</p><blockquote><p>Ben paints Emerson as a power-hungry villain when almost all of the last 4 years Emerson has been working part-time on EA things, gives his money away quietly, and is almost always behind the scenes, giving credit and decision-making power to others</p></blockquote><p>The quote given in support of this is \"I think Emerson is very ambitious and would like a powerful role in EA/X-risk/etc.\" In my opinion, the quote and the paraphrase are very different things, especially since, as it happens, that quote is not even from the original post, it's from a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH/sharing-information-about-nonlinear?commentId=SbPFnWfLyiD4A7oDt\">comment</a>.</p><p>The Google Doc then goes on to describe the reasons Drew believes that Emerson is not ambitious for status within EA. This is ultimately a character judgement, and I don't have a strong opinion about who is correct about Emerson's character here. However, I do not think it's actually important to the issue at hand, since the purported ambition was not in fact load-bearing to the original argument in any way.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The second section is longer, and goes on for several pages. It concerns Emerson's previous company, Dose.&nbsp;</p><p>Specifically, in the original post, Ben quoted a couple very negative Glassdoor reviews about Dose and about Emerson specifically. He also noted there were \"also far worse reviews about a hellish work place which are very worrying, but they\u2019re from the period after Emerson\u2019s LinkedIn says he left, so I\u2019m not sure to what extent he is responsible he is for them.\"&nbsp;</p><p>According to the Google Doc, Ben's original post included those reviews and he only removed them after being prompted several times. If that's true, that seems suboptimal but not horrible: that's the point of sharing posts with people before sharing them publicly.</p><p>Nonlinear's response also claims that&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/dxRw2xPQWFLjyr7WH/apply-to-greater-than-30-ai-safety-funders-in-one-1?commentId=dvzGmsnXZKiieqrqC\">However, the evidence shows that the opposite is true: while Emerson was CEO, Dose\u2019s average ratings were ~3.9, roughly the same as Meta (#57 best place to work in 2022).&nbsp;</a> Also, Dose was featured on a number of Best Places To Work Lists, which use anonymous company-wide surveys, which Ben\u2019s article did not include.</p></blockquote><p>The link goes to a comment where Kat calculates that average. I double-checked the numbers by averaging all the Emerson-era reviews, and I got a slightly lower number, but probably that was because I did not know exactly when he left and included all of the 2017 reviews in the average. <i>However</i>. One of the reviews says:</p><blockquote><p>All of these super positive reviews are being commissioned by upper management. That is the first thing you should know about Spartz, and I think that gives a pretty good idea of the company's priorities.</p></blockquote><p>and that seems important. Overall, the reviews, even the overall positive ones, appear to have a consensus that there was a huge amount of micromanagement, and a lot of confusion and lack of direction. Which is not a mortal sin, but seems worth keeping in mind.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Side note: the EA Forum, months later, found someone had been sockpuppeting the original Nonlinear-Bad-EA Forum thread based on Alice/Chloe\u2019s lies - the sockpuppets created even more false consensus.</p></blockquote><p>This claim has no links or sources, and by its nature, will not be in the original post, so I'm not sure how to fact-check it.</p><blockquote><p>Habryka found that it was difficult to find particularly negative reviews, until finally he found <i>one</i> anonymous comment claiming \u201cmanagement commissioned positive reviews\u201d... whatever that means.</p></blockquote><p>This part has no links to sources, so I don't know what exactly Habryka found or said about it, but in fact there are seven 1-star reviews from this period, out of a total of 35 reviews. (The comment mentioning commissioned reviews was actually not one of them.) Obviously Nonlinear is correct that one anonymous allegation of commissioning reviews is not conclusive, but in my subjective opinion, it seems broadly plausible.</p><p>This section also contains a great deal of anger at Ben for his perceived carelessness with Emerson's reputation. I agree that the anger would be justified if he was in fact careless, but I do not in fact see all that much evidence of that carelessness in this section. Which makes the outrage ring somewhat hollow. It is difficult to take seriously accusations that Ben \"frames it in the most outrage-inducing way\" when, as far as I can tell, that is what the document I am reading is doing.</p><p>Overall, my impression is that the evidence is inconclusive about whether Emerson was a bad boss at Dose.

While Nonlinear claim that Chloe is entitled, it's still the case that her beef with them is largely around the tensions of living together (primes her to expect equal-ness and friendship) combined with her having to do tasks for them that make her feel like her time isn't being valued. (Plus things around the vagueness of her role and her being repeatedly negatively surprised by things they expect of her or ways they treat her.)<br><br>Even if you take Nonlinear's account at face value, it seems like you'd have a lot of uncertainty about the claim \"Chloe is likely to be destructive in other contexts.\"&nbsp;<br><br>Lastly, I again want to flag that I don't consider it established that Chloe is entitled or unreliable. ((To some degree, the same caveats may also apply to claims about Alice, but I haven't focused on that much because it seems like Nonlinear have a lot of anonymized evidence?, and it's hard to argue with that..., plus even Ben acknowledged that Alice feels like less reliable a source than Chloe.)) I don't think someone has to be entitled to feel devalued doing assistant-type tasks for others. It really depends on how you're treated. It's a bit suspicious that an assistant feeling unvalued is framed as \"the assistant didn't like being an assistant.\" Sure, this could be true. But it could also be true that the assistant simply didn't like aspects of how they were treated, and these things can be subtle and not easy to explain, but we all know that there are \"horrible bosses\" and \"entitled bosses,\" so it's not like this is a complaint with a very low base rate.

I know several people who have interacted with them - mainly with Kat - and had good experiences. I know several people who deeply admire her. I have interacted with Kat occasionally, and she was helpful. I have only read good things about Emerson.&nbsp;<br><br>As far as I can tell from this and everything I know/have read, it seems reasonable to assume that the people at Nonlinear are altruistic people. They have demonstrably made exceptional commitments to doing good; started organisations, invested a lot of time and money in EA causes, and helped a lot of people.&nbsp;<br><br>Right now, on the basis of what could turn out to have been a lot of lies, their reputations, friendship futures and careers are at risk of being badly damaged (if not already so).&nbsp;<br><br>This may have been (more) justified if the claims in the original post were all found and believed to be clearly true. However, that was, and is not, clearly the case at this point in time.&nbsp;<br><br>At present, Nonlinear have demonstrably set aside significant time to write a huge response to the claims made against them. From my initial reading they seem to have largely shown that most claims were not accurate, that the sources of the claims were unreliable (and bad actors), that the method of investigation was unfair (as per their example of its use toward Ben).<br><br>Despite this, NL have not been shown much support or sympathy. Relatively few (popular) comments appear to say something like \"thank you for writing this up... it must have been hard to deal with the accusations... I changed my mind on x based on your evidence....I still don't think you were correct about y - can you say more there.\"<br><br>Instead, as I see it, the main, or at least most upvoted, response here has been to critique stylistic mistakes made in their almost impossible task of refuting very damaging claims from anonymous sources in unknown contexts. Or to critique remote work and travel while trying to do good, or various ways they are running their organisation unconventionally etc.<br><br>[I admit that I am conflicted on the part about Ben - I agree it could be seen as unfair but it shows how his method was flawed in a very effective way. I can understand critiques of this - but surely a comment that is solely a critique isn't the best/fairest way to respond to a post like this in this context]<br><br><strong>If you face a lot of false accusations, I can't even imagine how hard it is to find the time and mental strength to produce what has been produced, let alone to respond to all the comments in a measured way.&nbsp;</strong><br><br>If, and it is still to be determined, the claims made were largely false, then I think it is incredibly impressive and admirable that NL still made such a great effort to refute them despite the amount of ingratitude, criticism and unkindness that they faced in the comments on the original post.<br><br>I can't help but feel that too many people essentially made their minds up after reading the first post from Ben and are now consciously or unconsciously seeking to maintain their prior negative associations.<br><br>I'd like people to imagine what they would do in a similar situation if they were faced with similar accusations. How would you successfully persuade people that you didn't do the things you were accused of, and that the context was not as portrayed? How would you feel when most of the EA forum community appeared to form a firm impression that you and your organisation were bad, and didn't thank you for your effort of writing a huge response or really engage the counterclaims.<br><br><strong>Nonlinear and their members may have made some mistakes or acted unethically, but the evidence for this is currently in dispute. In light of what they have done previously, here, and more generally, they surely deserve more empathy and positive (or at least neutral) engagement than what they are getting. I imagine that all of us would want the same if put in their circumstances.</strong><br><br>As I finish this, I sort of regret starting to write it, and I may regret posting it. I just don't feel comfortable watching this happen without saying something.<br><br>As per my earlier comment, I still need to read Ben's original post and the full appendix from the response posts in more detail, to feel more confident about my judgement. I could change my mind and decide that Nonlinear etc made more serious mistakes than I thought and that I don't feel so positive about them anymore. However, I would still like a more charitable response to their efforts and evidence.<br><br>I will also admit that I do like to see the best in people, and this has led me astray in the past (e.g., &nbsp;with Gleb). I hope I am not wrong here.<br><br>22/12/23 Edit:<br><br>I said elsewhere that I would read the arguments from both sides and then make a final decision. I haven't done that because I didn't have time, and it didn't feel like high value. Especially in light of later posts and comments by people who are better qualified. I feel that it is still better (or at least closer to keeping my prior commitment) to state my current position for future readers than to not say anything further. With that in mind, this (copied from elsewhere) is where I ended up:<br><br>Before BP post: NL are a sort of atypical, low structure EA group, doing entrepreneurial and coordination focused work that I think is probably positive impact.<br>After BP post: NL are actually pretty exploitative and probably net negative overall. I'll wait to hear their response, but I doubt it will change my mind very much.<br>After NL post: NL are probably not exploitative. They made some big mistakes (and had bad luck) with some risks they took in hiring and working unconventionally. I think they are probably still likely to have a positive impact on expectation. I think that they have been treated harshly.<br>After <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bwtpBFQXKaGxuic6Q/?commentId=qqJyHp3AEqsjxAKMJ\">this</a> post: I update to be feeling more confident that this wasn't a fair way to judge NL and that these sorts of posts/investigations shouldn't be a community norm.&nbsp;<br><br>I am still pretty uncertain overall.

In fact, one of her unofficial titles was Fun Lord of Nonlinear, First of Her Name. One day, spontaneously, we decided to go on a trip to St. Barths. Emerson asked her to do her usual job, and she said \u201cIt\u2019s a weekend\u201d and he said, \u201cBut you like organizing fun trips!\u201d - she had said so many times - and she said sure.</p><p>She continued doing her job (arranging ATV rentals for the group - herself getting to ride as well of course). Then, when she complained, Emerson said \u201cOK\u201d and then just\u2026 went and did her job for her. And that was that.</p><p>(This is another example of Chloe coming in with the implicit frame that doing her job is abusive. \u201cEveryone sits down at a lovely cafe to have coffee and chit chat, while I\u2019m running around to car and ATV rentals to see what they have to offer.\u201d We can empathize with her wishing she could join us before finishing her job, but this was her job. Being an assistant is not abuse.)</p><p>The day after she talks to me about it, how she wants to not have work spontaneously sprung on her on a break day. I agree with her. I think break days should be sacred. I talk to Emerson about it and tell him that he can\u2019t do that, and that we cannot spring work on her on break days unless they\u2019re an actual emergency. He disagrees because he thinks it\u2019s totally normal for startup employees to ocassionally work on weekends, but I insist, and that\u2019s that.</p><p>We proceed to only ask her to do her job on work days. She must just not remember that we set up this policy. But we did.</p></blockquote><p>For comparison, here's Chloe's <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH/sharing-information-about-nonlinear?commentId=gvjKdRaRaggRrxFjH\">original</a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>There was a time during our stay at St Martin when I was overwhelmed from living and seeing only the same people every single day and needed a day off. Sometimes I\u2019d become so overwhelmed I became really bad at formulating sentences and being in social contexts so I\u2019d take a day off and go somewhere on the island where I could be on my own, away from the whole team - I\u2019ve never before and after experienced an actual lack of being able to formulate sentences just from being around the same people for too long. This was one of these times. We had guests over and the team with the guests had decided in the morning that it\u2019s a good vacation day for going to St Barths. I laid low because I thought since I\u2019m also on a weekend day, it would not be mine to organize (me and Kat would take off Tuesdays and Saturdays, these were sometimes called weekend or vacation days).</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Emerson approaches me to ask if I can set up the trip. I tell him I really need the vacation day for myself. He says something like \u201cbut organizing stuff is fun for you!\u201d. I don\u2019t know how to respond nor how to get out of it, I don\u2019t feel like I have the energy to negotiate with him so I start work, hoping that if I get it done quickly, I can have the rest of the day for myself.&nbsp;</p><p>I didn\u2019t have time to eat, had just woken up, and the actual task itself required to rally up 7 people and figure out their passport situation as well as if they want to join. St Barths means entering a different country, which meant that I needed to check in with the passport as well as covid requirements and whether all 7 people can actually join. I needed to quickly book some ferry tickets there and back for the day, rally the people to the cars and get to the ferry - all of this within less than an hour. We were late and annoyed the ferry employees - but this is one of the things generally ignored by the Nonlinear team, us being late but getting our way is a sign of our agency and how we aren\u2019t NPCs that just follow the prescribed ferry times - they\u2019re negotiable after all, if we can get away with getting to St Barths anyway.</p><p>I thought my work was done. We got to the island, my plan was to make the most of it and go on my own somewhere but Emerson says he wants an ATV to travel around with and without an ATV it\u2019s a bit pointless. Everyone sits down at a lovely cafe to have coffee and chit chat, while I\u2019m running around to car and ATV rentals to see what they have to offer. All ATVs have been rented out - it\u2019s tourist season. I check back in, Emerson says I need to call all the places on the island and keep trying. I call all the places I can find, this is about 10 places (small island). No luck. Eventually Emerson agrees that using a moped will be okay, and that\u2019s when I get relieved from my work tasks.&nbsp;</p><p>I did describe this to Kat in my next meeting with her that it\u2019s not okay for me to have to do work tasks while I\u2019m on my weekends, and she agreed but we struggled to figure out a solution that would make sense. It remained more of a \u201clet\u2019s see how this plays out\u201d.</p></blockquote><p>It's probably best for readers to think first about whether they feel like the summary omits important things. I think it's fine to omit some things and mostly describe the incident from Kat and Emerson's perspective. But I think not mentioning the following three things, at least, is pretty bad form and misleading:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>There's a huge difference between&nbsp;<br>\"I tell him I really need the vacation day for myself\"<br>versus&nbsp;<br>\"Emerson asked her to do her usual job, and she said \u201cIt\u2019s a weekend\u201d<br>This difference above really changes the context for<br>\"He says something like \u201cbut organizing stuff is fun for you!\u201d.\"<br>Basically, for the version where Chloe only said \"It's a weekend,\" it's defensible to interpret Emerson's reply as a friendly negotiation attempt. By contrast, in the version where Chloe says \"I really need the vacation day for myself,\" the comment that most readily comes to my hyperbole-prone mind for \"But organizing stuff is fun for you!\" is \"psychopathic.\"<br>(To be fair, it could be that Chloe failed at expressing just how much she needed that day off \u2013 I think that's a common pattern with many people to struggle with voicing their needs and limits. Even so, I think it's bad form by Nonlinear to not acknowledge this discrepancy of accounts and instead impose their own framing on Chloe's account. It feels like trying to alter the frame covertly rather than discussing what happened in the open.) (Not to mention that \"she said so many times\" (about liking to organize trips) is totally beside the point, and pretending otherwise is bizarre. Like, if they can't even get this right here on the forum after three months of thinking about it, things don't look good.)</li><li>I think it's not okay to omit relevant context when they summarized the following passage:<br>\"(This is another example of Chloe coming in with the implicit frame that doing her job is abusive. \u201cEveryone sits down at a lovely cafe to have coffee and chit chat, while I\u2019m running around to car and ATV rentals to see what they have to offer.\u201d We can empathize with her wishing she could join us before finishing her job, but this was her job. Being an assistant is not abuse.)\"<br>They make it seem like Chloe was complaining about normal work on a normal work day. However, in this story, Chloe had agreed here to work on a weekend and she only expected that she had to organize the trip (St Martin and back) and nothing else. Getting the ATV rentals while everyone else was having coffee was <i>yet another unexpected task on her off day</i>. It's a very different thing to feel bad about unexpected new tasks coming up on your off day after you already felt like you got talked into doing more than you wanted, than it is to feel bad about normal work while your bosses are resting. It feels unfair not to acknowledge the true source of Chloe's discontent in this specific story about the cafe.</li><li>Chloe doesn't seem to agree with the following description:&nbsp;<br>\"Then, when she complained, Emerson said \u201cOK\u201d and then just\u2026 went and did her job for her.\"<br>Here, what Nonlinear omitted was this contradicting passage in Chloe's account:<br>\"All ATVs have been rented out - it\u2019s tourist season. I check back in, Emerson says I need to call all the places on the island and keep trying. I call all the places I can find, this is about 10 places (small island). No luck. Eventually Emerson agrees that using a moped will be okay, and that\u2019s when I get relieved from my work tasks.\"<br>It's strange to omit this. It sounds like Emerson insisted that she made ten phone calls before dropping the idea. To me, it feels quite demanding to ask your assistant to go to such great lengths on what was initially an off day for them (or at all, tbh), especially if you can probably infer based on their mood and behavior that they're not in the happiest and most energetic of states.</li></ul><p>In any case, this is the sort of thing that makes me feel like \"Nonlinear are being unfair and somewhat sneaky in their presentation.\"<br><br>To be clear, I'm not necessarily accusing them of deliberately misrepresenting what Chloe said. They might reasonably reply, \"We know Chloe said different things; after all, we linked to her long comment and we think forum readers can read for themselves. We decided to showcase our side of the story, how we remember it.\" However, even if that's how they reply, I think it's not okay to do things underhandedly like that, especially when they then go on and make strong negative statements about Chloe's entitlement and bad attitude based on their version of events, <i>without flagging that Chloe disagrees about so much of the context</i>. Doing things underhandedly is manipulative because <i>it hides possible points of disagreement</i>, making it seem like their version of the story is more obviously accurate/objective than it actually is.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Lukas_Gloor"}}, {"_id": "kB3mbKAe4eLhsEExW", "postedAt": "2023-12-14T03:34:59.123Z", "postId": "H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC", "htmlBody": "<p>If you think writing an 100 word summary of all of this content is as easy as downvoting, you're probably significantly overrating the value of your original comment.</p>", "parentCommentId": "zbadWhKsGeKbdoefv", "user": {"username": "pseudonym"}}, {"_id": "rCatSByG2GYZdjGrj", "postedAt": "2023-12-14T03:49:18.819Z", "postId": "H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC", "htmlBody": "<p>I wrote this in response to Ben's post&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Thanks for writing this post.<br><br>I've heard enough bad stuff about Nonlinear from before, that I was seriously concerned about them.

But I don't yet know who is telling the truth and who isn't. The reason I think this is that this don't look like just escalating misunderstandings. From what I can see [a<i>t least</i> one side is delusional or lying], but also [only one side being delusional or lying] is enough to explain the evidence. I still have enough faith in EA that I think most EAs are mostly sane an honest, which means that [only one side being delusional or lying] is more likely on priors.</li><li>I think the important thing now is to find the truth. Any discussions of what lessons to learn should wait.</li><li>I expect all of these public accusations to be very painful for everyone involved. I want to express sympathy for everyone involved. Someone is falsely accused of terrible things. I think I can imagine how much this hurts.</li><li>I still think it probably good that this issue get public scrutiny. Who ever is right, some of these allegations are serious enough that I don't think it should be over looked, and our community don't have some type of more closed doors court to appeal too. If this was not brough out, who ever is in the wrong, would probably continue to hurt more people. But I also have a lot of uncertainty on this point.&nbsp;</li><li>Even though I expect it to be mostly one sided (which I could be wrong about by the way). I also expect anyone involved in this, who is trying to be honest, will make mistakes, and will sometimes express things in a somewhat hyperbolic way.

(They will charge slightly less) This is because it is not actually fun or nice to live with your bosses, and having a live-in is considered more a perk for the FAMILY than the nanny.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile many well-meaning but uninformed bosses think their room is worth a lot of money to the nanny because it is expensive to the family.</p>\n<p>For example, I live in the Bay and I would RATHER pay $1000/mo to rent a room in grouphouse than stay in my bosses' extremely expensive fancy house for free, even though my bosses' mortgage for that room is very expensive to them.</p>\n<p>Similarly, a boss spending $5000 to take you to Costa Rica is not giving you $5000 of value. You aren't choosing where you are going or what the money is spent on.

Alice eventually gave in and ate non-vegan food in the house\u201d&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>You start with the one that I do think I made the biggest update on, though I also think most of the relevant evidence here was shared back during the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH/sharing-information-about-nonlinear?commentId=Ejbe8ukX6FhrfRv5C\">original discussion</a>. I am still kind of confused what happened here, and am hoping to dig into it, but I agree that there are some updates for me (and I assume others) here, and I currently think Alice's summary is overall pretty misleading.&nbsp;</p><p>To be clear, in the quoted section Ben is summarizing what Alice told him, and Ben's original post also directly includes this summary from Kat:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Second; the semi-employee said that she wasn't supported in getting vegan food when she was sick with Covid, and this is why she stopped being vegan. This seems also straightforwardly inaccurate, we brought her potatoes, vegan burgers, and had vegan food in the house. We had been advising her to 80/20 being a vegan and this probably also weighed on her decision.</p></blockquote><p>I think with both of these being listed, I am reasonably happy with the presentation and am glad that we included both sides on this.&nbsp;</p><p>You also say:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>(from my reading of the evidence this is not close to accurate, and I believe Ben had access to the counter evidence at the time when he published)</p></blockquote><p>This is inaccurate. I don't think there is any evidence that Ben had access to that doesn't seem well-summarized by the two sections above. We had a direct report from Alice, which is accurately summarized in the first quote above, and an attempted rebuttal from Kat, which is accurately summarized in the second quote above. We did not have any screenshots or additional evidence that didn't make it into the post.</p><hr><blockquote><p>\u201cBefore she went on vacation, Kat requested that Alice bring a variety of illegal drugs across the border for her (some recreational, some for productivity). Alice argued that this would be dangerous for her personally, but Emerson and Kat reportedly argued that it is not dangerous at all and was \u201cabsolutely risk-free\u201d&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Yep, this still seems accurate to me. As Kat has documented herself she asked Alice to bring Schedule 2 drugs across borders without prescription (whether you need a prescription in the country you buy it is irrelevant, what matters is whether you have one in the country you arrive in), something that can have quite substantial legal consequences (I almost certainly would feel pretty uncomfortable asking my employee to bring prescription medications across borders without appropriate prescription).&nbsp;</p><p>I also currently still think that requests for other more recreational drugs were made, and I don't consider the evidence to have debunked that, and wouldn't have phrased the original very differently based on the evidence provided (I am hoping to find more concrete evidence for requests for recreational drugs, though it's hard since as I understand these requests were verbal, if made at all).</p><p>Again, the original post also contains this summary of Kat's position:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Third; the semi-employee was also asked to bring some productivity-related and recreational drugs over the border for us. In general we didn't push hard on this. For one, this is an activity she already did (with other drugs). For two, we thought it didn't need prescription in the country she was visiting, and when we found out otherwise, we dropped it. And for three, she used a bunch of our drugs herself, so it's not fair to say that this request was made entirely selfishly. I think this just seems like an extension of the sorts of actions she's generally open to.</p></blockquote><p>This seems like a pretty good summary of what Nonlinear's current position is, and so I feel pretty good about the details given here.&nbsp;</p><hr><blockquote><p>After being hired and flying out, Chloe was informed that on a daily basis their job would involve driving e.g. to get groceries when they were in different countries.</p></blockquote><p>I don't see any direct evidence for the daily vs. weekly claim, but I did update a bit on this dimension based on Kat directly claiming otherwise. My current best guess is that it was still multiple times a week, but not daily.</p><p>I do currently continue to believe that Chloe was pressured into driving without a license, and felt pressured to learn how to drive in the first place as part of her job. This kind of stuff is hard to arbitrate, and I don't consider the evidence provided in the Nonlinear appendix here very compelling (it's mostly just Kat asserting that she didn't pressure her).</p><p>I currently feel a bit sad about the \"daily\" here, but would write roughly the same thing replacing it with \"multiple times a week\".</p><p>In her comment, Chloe also explicitly says that getting taxis was hard, and often asking other people to drive her was the only option she saw, making me skeptical that the errands that she was expected to perform as part of her job were actually easily achievable via taxis:</p><blockquote><p><i>And boy did we have to negotiate. I needed to run a medical errand for myself in Puerto Rico and the amount of negotiating I needed to do to get them to drive me to a different city that was a 30 min drive away was wild. I needed to go there three times, and I knew the answer of anyone driving me would be that it\u2019s not worth their time, at the same time getting taxis was difficult while we were living in isolated mountain towns, and obviously it would have been easiest to have Drew or Emerson drive me</i></p></blockquote><hr><blockquote><p>\u201cIn summary Alice spent a lot of her last 2 months with less than \u20ac1000 in her bank account, sometimes having to phone Emerson for immediate transfers to be able to cover medical costs when she was visiting doctors. At the time of her quitting she had \u20ac700 in her account, which was not enough to cover her bills at the end of the month, and left her quite scared. \u201d</p></blockquote><p>I don't currently see anything inaccurate in this paragraph.&nbsp;</p><p>I do think it's currently sad that Ben's post didn't also mention Alice's company, though my understanding is that she had made hard commitments to herself and her family to never withdraw any funds from that until it was properly self-sustaining, and had communicated those commitments to Kat and Emerson. It is still true that she did not have that money in her bank account in a direct way, and that she really didn't want to withdraw that money for pretty reasonable reasons. I also think Nonlinear's summary of Alice making $3000/mo from this company is inaccurate and off by a factor of 4x or 5x. My understanding is that Alice made less than $10k from this company throughout its whole existence (which is not very surprising, making money with that kind of company is very hard, especially if you are only spending a single day a week on it).</p><p>Nonlinear talks about the outstanding reimbursements, which Ben also directly included:</p><blockquote><p>Though to be clear she was paid back ~\u20ac2900 of her outstanding salary by Nonlinear within a week, in part due to her strongly requesting it.</p></blockquote><p>The \"in part due to her strongly requesting it\" part currently feels unclear to me, and I would probably say something slightly different given my current epistemic state. I genuinely believe that Alice was afraid and concerned that Nonlinear would withhold the \u20ac2900 from her, and it is clearly the case that she racked up $3000 worth of reimbursements on a $1000 dollar salary, which is pretty scary. The central point for this inclusion was to demonstrate the financial dependence. Saying instead \"After she left she was paid back ~$3000 of outstanding reimbursements, which she was concerned Nonlinear might withhold from her or dispute being legitimate, which did help her financial situation\" seems like it gets the same point across and captures my current epistemic state better.</p><p>I think it would have been better to say that she was paid back $3000 in outstanding reimbursements instead of salary, but I don't think it makes a huge difference.</p><hr><blockquote><p>Afterwards, I wrote up a paraphrase of their responses. I shared it with Emerson and he replied that it was a \u201cGood summary!\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Yeah, I think it was a bad move to not include the follow-up of \"some points still require clarification\", but to be clear, I did totally interpret Emerson's email as saying it was basically a good summary. I think it's still bad to not have included the next sentence, and I was glad that it was corrected in <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Lc8r4tZ2L5txxokZ8/sharing-information-about-nonlinear-1?commentId=oXTodv8mXxxdeRdoy\">the comments at the time</a> (and I also somewhat think Ben should have updated the post to clarify that point so the correction is more easily visible).&nbsp;</p><p>For context, here is Emerson's message:&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/t85zDii8N4NFTiAFQ/hxxrrn3opopkihbxvalk\"></figure><p>Given the agreement-votes on this comment at the time, other people seemed to agree with me that summarizing the above as just a \"Good Summary\" was a kind of understandable mistake to make, and that this email did not successfully convey that Emerson disagreed with the points in the summary as provided,&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rm7BxYwroiKxNQW3Q/jnwyyzvznscyuzjskofe\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rm7BxYwroiKxNQW3Q/dxcak4gk2xebstcxnizu 170w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rm7BxYwroiKxNQW3Q/i7mmpuwixeshc078fcli 340w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rm7BxYwroiKxNQW3Q/xf9wedakfhqkep3abm40 510w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rm7BxYwroiKxNQW3Q/xv1bzpt26zyjs4i7jqyw 680w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rm7BxYwroiKxNQW3Q/acc6fifydmzby3atozap 850w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rm7BxYwroiKxNQW3Q/pzdkosiwfoadibrbusn6 1020w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rm7BxYwroiKxNQW3Q/b3drfhfcakutimiy50xx 1190w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rm7BxYwroiKxNQW3Q/pwiyc56zroxspdbgfb88 1360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rm7BxYwroiKxNQW3Q/ngbijfqym1rfmsc7qpjd 1530w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rm7BxYwroiKxNQW3Q/xjrvyv8uwqsqhzqy3jrl 1662w\"></figure><hr><p>Overall, yeah, given the messiness of a situation like this, I still feel quite good about basically all the quotes that you highlighted. I have now read the whole appendix to this post, spending over 10 hours going through it, and I can't find any clear rebuttal to almost any of what I consider the core claims in Ben's post.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, I do think someone might point out some inferences together with evidence in the appendix that might make me think some of the information that we quoted from sources is inaccurate. Both memory is fallible, and I also totally think that both Chloe and Alice had strong feelings here that might have clouded their judgement and memory. But as it stands, having spent a lot of time, I overall genuinely expected Nonlinear to be able to present more counter-evidence than Nonlinear was actually capable of providing, and currently think that any aggregate statements Ben made about probabilities he assigns to various behaviors, and the epistemic statuses he attached to statements made by Alice and Chloe, to still be quite well-calibrated and to capture the situation quite well.</p><p>It has still been less than a week, and the appendix is really massive, so if someone has clear rebuttals of things Ben said in the post, especially things that are not quotes or paraphrasings of Alice, but things that Ben directly claimed were true or where he expressed his epistemic state, I would be very interested in that.

When I stayed with all of the involved parties for a few days: Alice, Chloe, Kat, Emerson, and Drew (which was not in Peurto Rico), I got taxis twice, and it was slightly annoying - I spent about 5-10 minutes explaining where exactly to meet me, but was able to successfully get taxis on both of those occasions. Of course, that was just in one place that they lived (I think they were in that location for a couple of weeks if I recall correctly), and it might have been harder in other places, but at least in that location, getting taxis was no more than a minor nuisance.</p><p>Update: since it's so easy to verify the claim about taxis, I just went ahead and checked it myself. My understanding is that Chloe was talking about Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico. I used google maps to find and then call three taxi companies in that region. The first two didn't pick up. The third said to text them, which I did, and they gave me a quote for getting a taxi today to drive 40 minutes (which was $45). It took about 10 minutes of my time (and 20 minutes on the clock, since they took ~10 minutes to give me a quote).&nbsp;</p><p>I didn't realize this earlier, but in their evidence doc, Nonlinear talks about a similar check they did: &nbsp;\"Lastly, it was&nbsp;<i>not</i> complicated to get a taxi there.

I called one of them and they said it would cost $30 and they could come pick me up whenever.

If someone ends up in the financial red in a situation where they are having their living costs covered and being paid a $1k monthly stipend... I am not rushing to pass judgement on them, I am just noting that this seems like a bad fit for this sort of position, which I think NL has more than acknowledged, and if they misled NL about their financial security, that further alleviates NL of some responsibility]</p><p>Ok, so maybe it's just a shitty job offer despite the apparent perks?

At the same time, it wouldn't feel ideal either to pretend like I don't now have significant concerns about them.

To be fair, Chloe is currently protected by anonymity, so you could argue this is the smaller issue. However, some people contemplated de-anonymizing both Chloe and Alice, and I'm truly shocked by the suggestion to de-anonymize Chloe, especially since the message this would be sending is something like, \"public judgment that the community considers her a bad actor.\" For these reasons, I felt compelled to press the point that I think Nonlinear look bad to me in many ways both regarding initial events under discussion and related to how they now speak about Chloe, even though I'm also sympathetic to the viewpoint of \"maybe let it be, they've gone through enough.\"</p>", "parentCommentId": "G2sGBCjdWpSDQ5Z5h", "user": {"username": "Lukas_Gloor"}}, {"_id": "XRkoErcM3vuJP9QrZ", "postedAt": "2023-12-14T16:56:23.143Z", "postId": "H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC", "htmlBody": "<p>Agree that my epistemic state on this point is also something close to this.</p>\n<p>Summarized would be \"something like asking her to bring the drugs probably happened, and if so was a mistake that I'd hope was learned from, but the major issue would be if she was pressured to do it, and I'm unsure if I trust the person reporting enough to decide either way without evidence.\"</p>\n<p>[Edit: I know this is probably a frustrating thing for others to read, but seems worth saying anyway... since making the above comment I've had private information shared with me that makes me more confident NL didn't act in an abusive way regarding this particular issue.]</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "qfC69NCTxjJocyfrw", "user": {"username": "Daystar Eld"}}, {"_id": "mJSL4apBNFJMC7sHo", "postedAt": "2023-12-14T16:59:39.582Z", "postId": "H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC", "htmlBody": "<p>Reading&nbsp;<a href=\"http://h4dyehklxz5npqdbc\"><u>Lukas_Gloor\u2019s commen</u></a>t (and to a lesser extent,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims?view=postCommentsRecentReplies&amp;postId=H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC&amp;commentId=mY8HjjBT4pjdTWi4Z\"><u>this still helpful one from Erica_Edelman</u></a>) made me realize what I think is the big disagreement between people and why they are talking past each other.&nbsp;</p><p>It comes down to how you would feel about doing Alice/Chloe\u2019s job.&nbsp;</p><p>Some people, like the Nonlinear folks and most of those sympathetic to them, think something like the following:</p><p>\u201cWhy is she such an ungrateful whiner? She has THE dream job/life. She gets to travel the world with us (which is awesome since we can do anything and this is what we chose to do), living in some insanely cool places with super cool and successful people AND she has a large degree of autonomy over what she does AND we are building her up and like 15% of her job is some menial tasks that we did right before she joined and come on it\u2019s fine. How can you complain about the smallest unpleasant thing when the rest of your life rocks and this is your FIRST job out of college when this lifestyle is reserved for multimillionaires? She gets to live the life of a multimillionaire and is surrounded by cool EA people\u201d</p><p>Others look at Alice/Chloe\u2019s life and think something like the following:</p><p>\u201cWow, that really sucks to have to follow these people around all the time, doing whatever they want to do, living away from the comfort of your own home. She thought she was going to do operations work for a cool longtermist startup that was expanding but instead, she\u2019s always on the clock, paid very little, and being told that getting to travel alongside them and live like them is a PERK! Run away from these people as fast as possible! How is anyone defending these rich, entitled, exploiters? Of course, she would exaggerate some things, it felt like that!\u201d</p><p>Look at Lukas\u2019 comment again and how they each describe a certain experience in St. Barth\u2019s.&nbsp;</p><p>From Emerson/Nonlinear\u2019s perspective, they didn\u2019t bring someone on to do some stuff 9-5. They brought someone on to be one of them which includes doing stuff for a couple of hours whenever they pop up and this is just what it\u2019s like to be in a faster pace startup (how Nonlinear describes themself and how Emerson has always lived and how he built his previous companies). It was in the job description. She\u2019s going on this trip too after all and someone has to call the places to organize. Alright, she\u2019s whining again so I\u2019ll just take over, whatever.</p><p>From Chloe\u2019s perspective, she\u2019s been following these people around for the past month and always seeing them and wants a break from them and it\u2019s finally her supposed day off so she wants it off but they randomly decide to do a day excursion. Well, that sucks. Now she is forced to spend the day with them AND do stupid planning tasks trying to convince some random guy to let her plan this last minute just because Emerson wants to. She then tells Kat that she doesn\u2019t want to have to work on her weekends.</p><p>Look at Erica's comment. If you think this is like being a remote travelling nanny who should be getting paid extra for the travel but you are getting paid less, it sucks. If you think this is joining some cool remote/travelling charity startup, this is awesome.</p><p>This also explains why some people (as Kat would say, 19/21 people) who joined Nonlinear under this arrangement had a great time. They got to live a cool life, with a lot of freedom, in cool places. To them, this was a great experience. They got to pocket $12k/year into savings and live like a king.&nbsp;</p><p>Essentially, what I think happened is there was a really bad fit (and there are some bad incentives that are also at play here that will take too long to go into with regards to selecting a candidate) and different expectations between the parties. Nonlinear wanted to start adding people to their crew and expanding their team who travelled the world and worked on AI safety and wanting people to slot right into how they do things; taking spontaneous vacations, living in exotic places where it\u2019s always sunny, getting shit done regardless of who's job it is etc. Alice/Chloe might have thought they wanted it but didn\u2019t know and so they tried it out and they definitely didn\u2019t like it but didn't feel they could quit (Whether this was true or not. Remember that while they could probably leave whenever, they might not have felt like they could for reasons that are hard to explain).</p><p>What should have happened here? Hard to say. I think a gradual ramping up to this is super necessary and hiring people (from Nonlinear\u2019s perspective: adding people to the team) after a couple of interviews that you had never really spent a lot of time with or lived with before is ill-advised. A 1/2-week work trial seems especially necessary here. But Alice/Chloe also needed to be doing some constant introspection from day 1 if they wanted to stay here.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "MarcusAbramovitch"}}, {"_id": "Szfn2vwePPw4iH4Zw", "postedAt": "2023-12-14T17:03:41.089Z", "postId": "H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC", "htmlBody": "<p>I agree that asking employees to commit illegal acts they wouldn't normally commit is bad.

This is in large-part due to them doing very little accounting. In summary Alice spent a lot of her last 2 months with less than \u20ac1000 in her bank account, sometimes having to phone Emerson for immediate transfers to be able to cover medical costs when she was visiting doctors. At the time of her quitting she had \u20ac700 in her account, which was not enough to cover her bills at the end of the month, and left her quite scared. Though to be clear she was paid back ~\u20ac2900 of her outstanding salary by Nonlinear within a week, in part due to her strongly requesting it. (The relevant thing here is the extremely high level of financial dependence and wealth disparity, but Alice does not claim that Nonlinear failed to pay them.)</p><p>One of the central reasons Alice says that she stayed on this long was because she was expecting financial independence with the launch of her incubated project that had $100k allocated to it (fundraised from FTX). In her final month there Kat informed her that while she would work quite independently, they would keep the money in the Nonlinear bank account and she would ask for it, meaning she wouldn\u2019t have the financial independence from them that she had been expecting, and learning this was what caused Alice to quit.</p></blockquote><p>If you think these claims have been debunked, can you say where and in which way they are wrong?&nbsp;</p><p>There is one small thing in here that Nonlinear dispute, but do not provide hard evidence for, which is that her outstanding salary/reimbursements were paid back this quickly in part due to her strongly requesting it. I currently still believe this is true, though of course Nonlinear disputing it is some evidence.&nbsp;</p><p>However, I don't see any evidence against any of the other claims in these two paragraphs. This still seems like a quite good summary of the situation.</p><p>Edit: I think Jeff below makes a valid point that it matters a good amount whether the late payment was for \"salary\" or \"reimbursement\" and I would consider the claim that it was reimbursement instead of salary a relatively direct contradiction with the relevant sentence.</p>", "parentCommentId": "csMfsiNy8RaHdPnst", "user": {"username": "Habryka"}}, {"_id": "EGh8rAMSjuMEL99u6", "postedAt": "2023-12-14T19:04:52.518Z", "postId": "H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC", "htmlBody": "<p>It's misleading to frame the argument as \"them claiming things were inaccurate was appropriate reason to delay publication.\" The appropriate reason to delay publication was their evident willingness to compile specific counter-evidence within a week.

We were having some of the top figures in the field come live with us for weeks right during the dates she\u2019d chosen.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>She\u2019d basically be skipping one of the best career and impact opportunities of her life.&nbsp;</p><p>We, who were her mentors and employers, recommended she not miss out on this once in a lifetime opportunity. That she\u2019d probably have more impact if she visited her family at a different time. The friendships she made and the ideas she got exposed to might be the real big break in her ability to do good.&nbsp;</p><p>We were doing our best to launch Alice\u2019s career, and one of those ways to help her was providing her mentorship. Advice. She disagreed with the advice and said she\u2019d prefer to visit family. And we said, \u201cenjoy some quality family time!\u201d<br><br>(<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P4iLZPrQt-dxl9njvz1EvnB8qOBt11DVmtn8PHwFyPw/edit#bookmark=kix.u78ao3nma0ql\">Source; scroll up and it's directly above the linked screenshot, on the same page</a>.)</p></blockquote><p>In the short summary overview table, Nonlinear describes the claim that Alice was advised not to spend time with her family as a \"Bizarre, false accusation.\" However, the appendix includes the above description of a time when Nonlinear told her to postpone a family visit in order to spend time with EAs Nonlinear had invited to live with them. They say it happened only once, and they provide evidence that they encouraged her to interact with her family on other occasions; I consider this context at least partially mitigating, but I think describing this as a false accusation is misleading.</p><p>The advice about locals:</p><blockquote><p><strong>False, Questionable, or Misleading Claim: \u201c</strong>Alice and Chloe report that they were advised not to spend time with \u2018low value people\u2019, including their families, romantic partners,<strong> and anyone local to where they were staying\u2026\u201d</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>The Other Side:</strong> Alice was spending a lot of time hanging out with random Uber drivers and bartenders in rural Puerto Rico, while at the same time kept asking for advice and expressing a strong desire to have the largest impact possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course we like interacting with locals (that\u2019s partly why we travel) but at various points we gave advice like \u201cyou are the average of the 5 people you spend the most time with\u201d, and \u201cKat has been constantly introducing you to top EAs, so if you want to maximize impact it\u2019s usually higher leverage to spend time with them vs random bartenders\u201d However, Alice seems to have twisted this completely normal advice into a sinister attempt to control her, as is her pattern.&nbsp;</p><p>(<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P4iLZPrQt-dxl9njvz1EvnB8qOBt11DVmtn8PHwFyPw/edit#bookmark=kix.jods2rqwyprq\">Source</a>)</p></blockquote><p>Nonlinear says that they did sometimes advise Alice to spend less time hanging out with locals as opposed to with EAs they introduced her to, but clarify that Alice had asked for advice and said that she wished to maximize her impact. (They subsequently indicate that both Alice and Chloe sometimes hung out with locals and attended local events. Again, this is mitigating context in my view; however, if I take Nonlinear's description at face value, it would seem to indicate that Alice's claim was true.)</p><p>Based on Nonlinear's own recounting of events, I think it's true that Alice and Chloe were advised to prioritize spending time with people who Nonlinear considered to be high-impact, instead of family and locals. (I don't know whether this also happened with romantic partners, but Nonlinear at least does not report having done so). Nonlinear provides mitigating context, and I do not consider this to be proof that they were abusive as employers, but this makes it difficult for me to trust that their assessments of the evidence will match mine for the rest of the document.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "evere"}}, {"_id": "qPbWeaD3d6Pg2xZkK", "postedAt": "2023-12-15T14:04:17.398Z", "postId": "H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>I think if this is a summary of Kat's experiences with Ben</p></blockquote><p>Is it actually the case that Kat and Ben used to date?

She asks again about Burger King and is told it's inconvenient to get there. &nbsp;Instead, they go to a different restaurant and offer to get her something from the restaurant they went to. Alice looks at the menu online and sees that there are no vegan options. Drew confirms that 'they have some salads' but nothing else for her. She assures him that it's fine to not get her anything.</p><p>It seems completely reasonable that Alice remembers this as 'she was barely eating, and no one in the house was willing to go out and get her nonvegan foods' - after all, the end result of all of those message exchanges was no food being obtained for Alice and her requests for Burger King being repeatedly deflected with 'we are down to get anything that isn't fast food' and 'we are down to go anywhere within a 12 min drive' and 'our only criteria is decent vibe + not fast food', after which she fails to find a restaurant meeting those (I note, kind of restrictive if not in a highly dense area) criteria and they go somewhere without vegan options and don't get her anything to eat.&nbsp;<br><br>It also seems totally reasonable that no one at Nonlinear understood there was a problem. Alice's language throughout emphasizes how she'll be fine, it's no big deal, she's so grateful that they tried (even though they failed and she didn't get any food out of the 12/15 trip, if I understand correctly). I do not think that these exchanges depict the people at Nonlinear as being cruel, insane, or unusual as people. But it doesn't seem to me that Alice is lying to have experienced this as 'she had covid, was barely eating, told people she was barely eating, and they declined to pick up Burger King for her because they didn't want to go to a fast food restaurant, and instead gave her very limiting criteria and went somewhere that didn't have any options she could eat'.</p></blockquote><p>My guess is this aligned with Ben's interpretation at the time. The screenshots were relevant evidence, but they did not directly disprove anything in the original article.&nbsp;</p><p>Kat then shared further screenshots in the comments, which importantly were not shared with Ben beforehand<strong> </strong>(unless Spencer failed to forward them to me in my DM with him yesterday), that demonstrated that on the next day Kat did successfully bring her food.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the story, in the above screenshot, on December 15th, is that indeed Alice did not get food, despite her requesting it. The screenshots that Spencer sent us appear to fail to include the most relevant part of the conversation, which is that they did indeed fail to get her vegan food <s>that day </s>during that trip.</p><p>(Edit: Kat disputes this below, sharing some additional screenshots that seem to show that Kat did get food for Alice later that day, which seems important to get right. Though I don't think Spencer's screenshot demonstrated this).</p><p>Here are the edits I currently agree would have been better, though I think they are minor enough that I don't currently see it as a major error to not have included them:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Nonlinear disputes this, and sent dated screenshots<strong> </strong>that document part of the relevant conversation. In those screenshots we can see that on December 15th Alice did indeed request vegan food from multiple restaurants, but her and Drew ran into difficulties finding vegan food that was available in the area, and it seems like Nonlinear ultimate did indeed decline to stop by a different restaurant for Alice to get her vegan food, though the details are not fully clear. They agree that she quit being vegan at this time, and say it was because being vegan was unusually hard due to being in Puerto Rico. Alice disputes that she received any vegan burgers; we did not ask her to comment on the screenshots.)</p></blockquote><p>I really encourage you to look at the screenshots, Kelsey's summary, and Kat's original comment on the Nonlinear post and explain to me how these screenshots falsify part of the post. As we later received more screenshots, it seems like we actually received confirmation that the conversation on that date did indeed not result in Alice getting food.</p><p>(Edit: Kat shares some additional screenshots below that do seem to show Alice got food on the 15th, though not from the restaurant trip that was talked about in the screenshot Spencer sent us)</p>", "parentCommentId": "cLThFHGFwLMmeqvph", "user": {"username": "Habryka"}}, {"_id": "6FPtkrcN7GtjJKMff", "postedAt": "2023-12-15T20:44:19.127Z", "postId": "H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>You and Ben published a thorough, detailed article that mixed hundreds of hours of investigative reporting and opinion with a very specific goal: Destroy the reputation of a group within your community.

My current model is that if you want to be able to catch things like FTX early, before they explode as badly as they did and cause enormous harms, you need some better ways of propagating information than we had at the time.

When you're looking to publish those concerns, you should make reasonable efforts to verify their specifics, which matter a great deal and cannot be handwaved away.

How can you say that when she falsely accused someone of sexual assault, and tried to smear their character in her own way when proven wrong? She was demonstrably wrong. Please just let the dead rest. No one will like it, including Kathy's family and friends, if this gets brought up again. Honestly it is not appropriate that you posted her suicide letter which has falsehoods within, and we know how drama hungry the EA community is.&nbsp;I personally witnessed the pain and chaos her delusions prompted her to cause and it does not need to be repeated. Many people witnessed that pain but mostly we don't talk about it out of respect for the dead, because it is so evident she was unwell not malicious. It's very sad. If you don't see her claims constantly being refuted out in the open that's why. Most correction about Kathy happens over DM so as to not publicly embarrass her memory. But it's been 5 years and people on the EA Forum need to stop giving her falsehoods platform in your comments. So now I am writing this public response.<br><br>BTW you start off saying \"EA/rationalism does have a sexual assault problem\". Actually, this still remains to be proven that EA has issues with sexual misconduct (let alone assault) worse than other, say, millenial-coded, social communities. Yes there was a big blowup with Brent Dill and Vassar 5 years ago. Appalling stuff. But I fail to see how this necessarily translates to the average EA's experiences. As someone who has spent time in many social scenes (rave, burning man, nerd, gamer, poly, startup, animal liberation, spiritual/woo, and university social scenes to name a few) blowups happen everywhere thanks to the worst men. Women also have bad experiences everywhere. Unfortunately it is part of being a woman in a coed space. EA's social scene is very respectful/boundary-respecting toward women in my experience, and their reporting processes are good (even Kathy praised the reporting systems of EA/CEA). Is there room for improvement? Almost definitely, like anywhere else. I hope to see more improvement. But in my opinion EA does not have a noteworthy sexual misconduct problem in 2023. Let alone an <i>assault</i> problem.<br><br>Just my opinion based on my own experience. But it is just as valid a data point as anyone else's. If you are going to share stories, you could share the stories of women who have not experienced harassment too. Pushing back on this salacious narrative does not mean dismissing women's reports btw. We EAs should take reports extremely seriously. And I expect most reports will be true or mostly true. But we should also refrain from labelling the whole diverse community as being plagued with a \"sexual assault problem\" because some women have had problems. Men do troubling things in every community. Reports are extremely important so we can attend to those specific people and situations, but they tell us almost nothing about frequency/endemicness of harassment within the broader community. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Jt7p4JcbmiunZwsh6/announcing-surveys-on-community-health-causes-and-harassment\">Hopefully we get broader data soon.</a></p>", "parentCommentId": "EGn2YrwgQvtGHCFre", "user": {"username": "Ivy_Mazzola"}}, {"_id": "XRt3RBy8ijByy73j4", "postedAt": "2023-12-16T00:57:22.652Z", "postId": "H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC", "htmlBody": "<p>Another debunked financial claim: Ben's original post has:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Chloe's salary was verbally agreed to come out to around $75k/year.

Also, I actually think even a partial softening of Ben's post would've been important and might have materially changed Kat's response and increased community cohesion.

I really have to wonder if you actually read the Facebook threads, because that isn't damning at all. Especially not against Yudkowsky.. it's actually overtly vindicating of him. And it is intellectually dishonest that you even link the archived miricult website when even the medium piece and the Facebook posts malign it as essentially a highly inaccurate hit-piece. So, your second link contradicts the first. (The first is so nutty it's not believable anyway it's very pizzagate-ish).</p><p>And tbh, the facebook threads themselves discredit much of the second link where they are ironically posted within as proof of the claims it tries to make. &nbsp;<br><br>Also it is funny that if you read those Facebook threads, Michael Vassar is named as a primary source for some of those claims they discuss whether or not they could they be true. And Vassar is actually one of the few people that is agreed to be a sexual harasser/assaulter and serious agent of chaos. He is one of the men RuffleJax names in your 3rd and 4th links. So, your third and fourth links which implicate Vassar as a bad actor, in so doing also discredit the 1st and 2nd about MIRI involvement in statutory rape/blackmail/etc.&nbsp;<br><br>As for the RuffleJax tweet allegations, yes serious stuff. I can't comment on the Rettek stuff because I am not in the rationality community to the extent to know, but <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7b9ZDTAYQY9k6FZHS/abuse-in-lesswrong-and-rationalist-communities-in-bloomberg?commentId=BYvgpTxBTCZJQqHCz\">Vassar has been discussed on here before </a>and has been banned from EA and SlateStarCodex events for quite a while. Please read that link. Plus RuffleJax admits that the only reason she included EA in her tweets, not only rationality, was out of respect for Kathy naming EA. RuffleJax only had issues in rationality, but it is proven that Kathy was wrong about EAs so there was never any reason for RuffleJax to mention EA and doing so was a mistake on her part tbh. Relatedly, I wish you too would not speak of EA and rationality as though they are interchangeable.<br><br>That same <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7b9ZDTAYQY9k6FZHS/abuse-in-lesswrong-and-rationalist-communities-in-bloomberg?commentId=BYvgpTxBTCZJQqHCz\">Vassar discussion</a> also is a good enough rebuttal to the Time piece, though there is a lot more to be concerned about with the veracity and relevance if you dig for anything that doesn't already confirm your ideas that EA has an abnormally high rate of sexual assaulters:</p><p>Questions like, were any women with recent experiences who spoke to journalists actually interacting with EAs, or were they interacting with startup and coliving people in the bay and assigning the responsibility to EAs? As 2023 has progressed, people have become a lot more aware that EA does not necessarily include E/acc and other random bay area armchair-philosophizer, polyamorous, and AI-obsessed types. But tbh most people could be forgiven for being mistaken about this when the TIME journalist was doing interviews. More questions you might care about could be: Had the EA community health team handled those complaints already to the victim's satisfaction? Are perpetrators cast out and what are the banning procedures? Should it matter for EA's reputation that the EA community had not been given the chance to handle some of those complaints? (Some women spoke to TIME without ever having told anyone of the behavior they experienced and I think this matters, because men do sexual misconduct everywhere behind closed doors. So I think it is more how a community handles misconduct <i>when reported</i> that should matter for that community's reputation. How else would other EAs not experiencing harassment know about it? Reports are so essential). And is this quantity of complaints one can dig up unusually large for a community of this size and diversity, especially if you allow yourself to go back 5 or more years in collecting reports? (In my experience no this is not an unusual quantity of complaints going back 5 years)<br><br>It feels like you are just throwing everything you can think of to prove your preconceptions, but the intellectually honest thing would be to pick the things you think are valid only. Your links either contradict each other (as with the first 4) or are redundant and outdated (as Vassar is implicated strongly in both RuffleJax's tweets and the Time piece and has been dealt with) and actually paint a picture of a hit-piece not a serious critique or expose at all.&nbsp;<br><br>I don't want to comment much on what did or didn't happen. What I will comment on myself is this: <strong>Those instances where we can actually identify the alleged bad actors were a long time ago:</strong></p><ul><li>The miricult stuff was alleged to have happened <strong>10 years ago</strong> (and I'm not sure this relates to EA anyway tbh). Personally I don't find them believable allegations anyway. But I'll leave it at 10 years.</li><li>The RuffleJax/Vassar/Rettek stuff was alleged<strong> 5 years ago</strong> and has been dealt with, and has <i>nothing</i> to do with EA by her own admission.</li><li>The one thing in the Time piece that was definitely attached to EA and not Vassar or startup/AI culture (the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9JCkkjKMNL4Hmg4qP/ev-uk-board-statement-on-owen-s-resignation\">OCB stuff</a>) was also <strong>5 years ago </strong>and has been dealt with. In fact the woman had told CEA that she was satisfied with CEA's handling prior to the TIME piece being written. The dynamics were also quite a lot more socially complicated than it was made out to be in the Time piece.</li></ul><p>If your claim is still that EA and/or rationality has a sexual harassment or assault problem <strong>today</strong>, I'm sorry but your data just does not prove that in the slightest. If you disagree with this still then I really don't know what to say. Maybe, \"encourage women to make more reports that include date and names?\" Because right now it is impossible to say what has been going on <strong>in recent years</strong>. It's always going to be harder to prove a negative (that sexual misconduct <i>doesn't </i>happen much in EA or rationality), but at least if reporting were the norm, lacking recent reports would be a good signal. Right now it's hard to say if it means that misconduct instances or low, or just that women were avoiding reporting and wanted to exit the community asap.&nbsp;</p><p>It's funny because back in 2018 I was <i>extremely </i>hard on the rats about the Brent Dill stuff. Now 5 years later I'm the one who is reminding everyone that time has passed and it's possible things changed. I witnessed the rat community wake up to abuses and people really started paying a lot more attention to twisted dynamics. I am actually really hopeful that not only have things gotten better, but that EA (and maybe even rationality!!) is a more respectful place for women than other counterfactual communities. Again, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Jt7p4JcbmiunZwsh6/announcing-surveys-on-community-health-causes-and-harassment\">it looks like we will have better data soon</a>. But your links are not good data at all that there is a current issue. I don't understand the rush to condemn an entire diverse community, almost every one of whom cares deeply about sexual misconduct as much as anyone else who, say, read that TIME piece.

But that isn't what turned out to be the case:</p><ul><li>Nonlinear has evidence that on December 15, they had oatmeal, peanuts, almonds, prunes, tomatoes, cereal, an orange, mixed nuts, and quinoa (which Kat offered to cook) in the house.</li><li>On the same day, Kat had <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P4iLZPrQt-dxl9njvz1EvnB8qOBt11DVmtn8PHwFyPw/edit#bookmark=id.whlxyxt6wzqh\">successfully purchased</a> mashed potatoes for Alice.</li><li>On the next day, they apparently went out and purchased both <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P4iLZPrQt-dxl9njvz1EvnB8qOBt11DVmtn8PHwFyPw/edit#bookmark=id.u44i21xi843k\">Panda Express vegan noodles</a> and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/171yUeCg3Z3HDPRrPT_nKSZaNaj4ujZYs73af_zmuW2U/edit\">vegan burgers</a> for Alice.</li><li>At some point, Emerson went out and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P4iLZPrQt-dxl9njvz1EvnB8qOBt11DVmtn8PHwFyPw/edit#bookmark=id.buaixlrhb3vz\">tried</a> to purchase Alice more food despite his knee injury, but he couldn't find the very specific items she requested.</li><li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P4iLZPrQt-dxl9njvz1EvnB8qOBt11DVmtn8PHwFyPw/edit#bookmark=id.rii7b0antw0j\"><i>Then</i></a>, on December 18, it looks like Alice's first non-vegan meal was a vegetarian pizza she ordered (rather than non-vegan food already in the house). It looks like she ordered it right after Kat reminded her that they already had vegan noodles in the fridge.</li><li>On top of all of this, apparently everybody in the house was either sick or injured, but Ben's post only mentions that Alice was sick.</li><li>It seems that Alice/Ben have no evidence to counter any of the points above.</li></ul><p>So the original claim that was stated as fact (\"nobody in the house was willing to go out and get her vegan food\") seems very wrong.

To clarify where I think we are on the same page: I am pretty unhappy about that section, and wouldn't ask Ben to write something different given what I believe today.&nbsp;</p><p>The thing I was responding to was whether we misrepresented the evidence that we did have at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>On that topic, I do think it was a mistake to omit as many of the \"Alice/Chloe claims that X\" in the post as we did, and fall back into a neutral third-party way of summarizing the claims, and given that we did, I think it makes sense to hold Ben and Lightcone more responsible for the veracity of statements that did not include an explicit \"Alice/Chloe alleges X\".</p><p>I also think that there is a pretty reasonable case to be made that we should have waited longer on getting more evidence from Nonlinear. I felt conflicted on this topic then, and feel conflicted now. I really hate that the situation we were in made it quite hard for us to wait longer for Nonlinear to respond to us. I am still not fully sure whether I would wait if I was in this situation again, since the considerations against waiting were also quite strong, though overall I am leaning slightly that waiting would have been the better option (I do not think this forgives or excuses Nonlinear's attempts at intimidation and threats of retaliation).</p><p>However, overall on the question of \"did we accurately summarize the evidence available to us\", I think Ben's post and this section is doing pretty well.&nbsp;</p><p>I agree that we frame Alice and Chloe's evidence as more trustworthy, and in-aggregate, across the whole post, I stand behind that framing, in that I think Alice and Chloe are substantially more reliable sources of evidence than Kat and Emerson. I agree that in this situation I think this went the wrong way around and it looks to me like the vegan food situation seems like it was represented to us in a substantially misleading way, and I am still hoping for me or Ben to follow up with Alice on this topic and figure out whether I am missing something. However, I think on-average the framing of the post was not misleading about the balance of evidence that we had received to that point (including accounting for expected future evidence Nonlinear that we expected Nonlinear might provide).</p><p>Some smaller nitpicks on your comment:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>In contrast, Nonlinear's perspective is shared as \"[Nonlinear] says [x].\"</p></blockquote><p>It's true that we don't share Nonlinear's perspective with the same authority as Alice and Chloe's. We did also include a summary directly written from their perspective, which I do think helps:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>This seems also straightforwardly inaccurate, we brought her potatoes, vegan burgers, and had vegan food in the house. We had been advising her to 80/20 being a vegan and this probably also weighed on her decision.</p></blockquote><p>Another quick comment:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>It seems that Alice/Ben have no evidence to counter any of the points above.</p></blockquote><p>I would give people some time before concluding that. While Ben (and I) are trying really hard to not be dragged into a full-on follow-up investigation of this, I do expect there will be some kind of response to this which includes procuring more evidence. I personally do feel pretty convinced on this point, but I am not updating on Alice or Ben not providing more evidence in coming to that conclusion, since they haven't responded to anything so far, and I do know that many of the claims in the OP and associated appendix are inaccurate, and those also haven't been responded to yet (it includes many claims about what Ben believes or what the process of writing Ben's original post was like, which I am very confident are inaccurate).</p>", "parentCommentId": "AE992Zhu4JsDCr3Nb", "user": {"username": "Habryka"}}, {"_id": "sygjXeaWTvdjTLJ92", "postedAt": "2023-12-18T00:55:01.480Z", "postId": "H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC", "htmlBody": "<p>I'd say Vassar was a primary source for the salaciousness of the wording of the whole situation. Which is what matters if you are going to say it is damning. Because, surely you don't think a 17yo who consented and is still in the community 10 years later who has shown no apparent problem looking back on it, is that big of a deal?<br><br><strong>Did you know that in every European country and 38/50 US states the legal age of sexual consent is 17 or below?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Don't you think this makes 18 more of a legal quirk than a boundary on which to park your moral disgust reactor? Now I personally like the age of consent being high because it makes taking legal action extremely easy in case people behave badly. It means people should behave carefully. And I think it is dumb and often emotionally risky to have sex with a 17 yo. But dumb is not the same as unethical, and <i>often</i> emotionally risky is not the same as <i>always</i> emotionally risky. From what I have heard elsewhere, that person was one month from turning 18, and they weren't like, plucked off the street for having a sexy body or something. It seems everyone knew each other and had been friends/friendly for months. I'm not seeing proof of abuse of power or objectification going on.</p><p>FWIW you can literally ask people for details as I have done before now. These are real people who had the experiences you are gossiping about. 10 years ago. I have never understood this desire to gossip rather than actually do something meaningful to root out and address problems. I think if you wouldn't have the guts to approach the now-27yo or someone else you think might have been involved, that is probably your conscience telling you \"ah tbh you are overstepping and you know it isn't really a real issue\" in which case you shouldn't have the guts to spread their private info on internet forums. It really reads to me as pretending something was a big deal that you really know was not. If you really think someone was abused there (and especially if you think that risk remains today!) please reach out to some relevant parties. I would applaud you for putting your effort where your mouth is.&nbsp;<br><br>So anyway I still think it is not damning. And even if it were damning, you have no idea who it was. You have no idea if that person whoever it was still even works at MIRI. It almost def wasn't Yudkowsky according to that thread. So why are you using that to support to your thesis that EA has problems today? Very strange. I'm all in support of rooting out bad behavior toward women or minors. But your chain of reasoning does not hold to support such a grand conclusion about a community of tens of thousands of people across dozens of cities. It does not even hold to support the claim that MIRI has an issue. It's been 10 years. In case it isn't obvious, I'm not dying on the hill that nothing bad happened. I have only even responded to you again and again because I am under the impression you are trying to prove that EA has a problem with sexual misconduct <i>today.</i><br><br>As for the rest of your comment... It's super weird you are tracking this all down about Yud. It has absolutely nothing to do with your original thesis and it is moving the goalposts, for a new goal which I'm not even sure what it might be. If you don't like Yudkowsky, just say that. You are free to say that. You can say you think Yudkowsky is a dick, or a jerk, or is wrong about things.* What you are not allowed to do is take your feelings about someone, feelings based of of cherrypicked pieces from an extremely prolific writer, and use those feelings for motivated reasoning to share those cherrypicked bits as suggestion that that person has abused children or teens, and then even further, use <i>that </i>as proof that the community he is a part of has a drastic sexual assault or harassment problem. TO MAKE THOSE CLAIMS IS SO WILDLY INAPPROPRIATE AND FAR-FETCHED IT IS ESSENTIALLY SLANDEROUS. And if you aren't making those claims, I have no idea what you are trying to say tbh.&nbsp;<br><br>If I were you I would really ask yourself what you are trying to do here. Is it help women? If so, how is what you are doing helping? What could you do that is more helpful for women, that doesn't just leave a bunch of chaos and misinformation in your wake about people (EAs, including EA women who try to address sexual misconduct) who don't deserve it?&nbsp;<br><br>I will not be responding to further comments. I only expect more gish gallop from you. I warn everyone reading this to significantly downgrade their trust in what you write next in this thread. To the extent a reader can agree I have refuted your first-choice arguments, and your second-choice, and then your third-choice, I highly doubt your 4th and 5th choice set of gish gallops will suddenly be intellectually honest and prove your <i>original</i> thesis. Which again, is all I'm here for. Not dying on the hill that nothing bad ever happened, obviously. I actually view <i>that</i> claim as an impossibility, because I think crappy men occasionally do bad things to women in every coed community.&nbsp;<br><br>*FWIW Yud is right though that pedophilia is different than ephebophilia. [[Edit 1: IDK why he wrote that and neither do you. For all we know, he could have been saying \"Inb4 any edgelords reply that pedophilia isn't inherently harm-causing. If you believe that, you must be thinking of ephebophilia and regardless of what I think, I refuse to have this conversation today. Reminder that I'm talking about pedophilia, not ephebophilia.\" And we don't even know if he meant ephebophilia in the sense of \"an insatiable fetish\" or \"the possibility to feel some attraction for some teens.\"</p><p>But no matter why he wrote it, or in what sense he meant that term, I agree with his statement. E and P are NOT the same.]] It's disgusting to speak as though attraction to or sex with a 17yo is the same as attraction to or sex with a 12yo, 8yo, or 4yo. Ephebophilia even includes 18 and 19 year-olds so you aren\u2019t even necessary venturing into illegal territory. If you equivocate E with P, then I claim you are nothing more than a moral relativist robot who bases morality on the letter of whatever local law you happen to exist under, and doesn't understand what is truly twisted about sex with children. I'm actually angry that you'd try to corner <i>me </i>in this discussion as being the one with the unacceptable opinion if I agree with Yud's obviously correct opinion there. Everyone agrees with that around the world. Which is why 17 and even 16 years old are very, very common legal ages of consent. Much more so than age 18, which is a relatively uncommon legal age of consent. About 25% of countries/states have a legal age of sexual consent that is 18 or older. And the remaining 75% have 17 or under. I think there are valid reasons to have the law at 18 or higher, but they are not that potential sex with, let alone attraction to, a 17yo is objectively wrong. They are more to add strength to a <i>potential victim's</i> toolkit. I don't think it makes sense for <i>someone else</i> (you) to yell statutory rape regarding<i> a consenting 17 year old.</i> Only the victim themselves doing so makes sense to me, if they are <i>that old at time of consent</i>. If someone thinks they were taken advantage of at 17yo, when reflecting years later, let them take it to court or their community under statutory rape. And let everyone in our culture be aware this is a thing that can happen. I want everyone to be careful and screw them if they were careless enough to cause a problem for someone down the line. Support people if they come forward, but if not, mind your business I'd say, and don't go imagining coercive cultures that you've got no proof of. I realize it might sound salacious in a PC culture, but please get yourself together and realize that once in a while a 17 year old will strongly desire to have sex <i>and</i> be able to meaningfully consent to sex. Most other countries, states, and people understand that.</p><p>[[Edit 2: I just want to make it very clear that if someone came forward unhappy with their 17yo experiences at the hands of older people, I would support them in taking retributive action. Problems can obviously occur in those types of arrangements. But I still don't expect a case from 10 years ago to be proof of broader problems today. I have seen and experienced way too much sexual misconduct by men to believe that episodes <i><strong>ten years ago</strong></i><strong> </strong>(and prior to the Me Too Movement too, when I witnessed a lot of men \"wake up\" about this stuff and become better at policing their communities)<strong> </strong>should prompt us to typecast and trash an org, community, or subculture <i><strong>today</strong></i>. I'd have to throw the whole world out, and I promise I'm not overdramatizing when I say that.]]</p>", "parentCommentId": "yxNrdkZCfXMBytiyc", "user": {"username": "Ivy_Mazzola"}}, {"_id": "rpDEoe2ERFD2p6WR7", "postedAt": "2023-12-18T01:19:03.738Z", "postId": "H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>I stand behind that framing, in that I think Alice and Chloe are substantially more reliable sources of evidence than Kat and Emerson.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Given Chloe is not involved in this claim, do you also stand behind the framing that Alice is more reliable than Kat/Emerson?</p>", "parentCommentId": "dAMaBvun69vXNLz2r", "user": {"username": "pseudonym"}}, {"_id": "WPEJqQZqHbErmsaBZ", "postedAt": "2023-12-18T01:21:21.128Z", "postId": "H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC", "htmlBody": "<p>I am substantially less confident in that claim, though yeah, I would still overall say I believe it (it's not super well-operationalized so not super clear what a probability would mean, but like, I guess I am at ~80% that if I knew all the facts and had arbitrary insight into Alice's, Kat's and Emersons' life that I would overall expect Alice to be reporting more accurately than Kat and Emerson)</p>", "parentCommentId": "rpDEoe2ERFD2p6WR7", "user": {"username": "Habryka"}}, {"_id": "swFi2AAPu7KrkkMaX", "postedAt": "2023-12-18T01:49:22.340Z", "postId": "H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC", "htmlBody": "<p>I am commenting to encourage everyone to think about the real people at the centre of all of the very ugly accusations being made, which I hope is acceptable to do, even though this comment does not directly address the evidence presented by either Lightcone or Nonlinear.&nbsp;</p><p>This is getting a lot of engagement, as did Ben Pace\u2019s previous post, and for the people being discussed, this must be incredibly stressful.

It seems like if somebody got a scholarship that included room and board, and then they get upset, because they would have spent it on a different house. If they accept the scholarship, then that is how they would spend it. They would spend it on that house and that food, because that is what they chose. They could have just tried to get a different scholarship or a job. In fact, if you accept that scholarship, and then speak to the people who gave you it and say that you would prefer cash instead and they say yes, that is exceptionally generous and way outside the norm of what is expected.&nbsp;</p><p>If a scholarship/fellowship/job offered you room and board and you accepted and then later asked for cash instead I suspect that 98% of them would say no.&nbsp;</p><p>She is trying to make it sound like a hardship and us being unreasonable when it is incredibly unreasonable to ask for your compensation package to be changed so quickly after you accepted it.&nbsp;</p><p>Most people do not ask for changes in compensation until they've been working for at least a year.&nbsp;</p><p>Most people if they\u2019re offered room and board + stipend never get the option of switching to cash only.</p><p>Most people don\u2019t accept a compensation package and then later say they would have preferred a different compensation package and therefore they were financially controlled.&nbsp;</p><p>Most people don\u2019t go to the EA Hotel and say that they\u2019re being financially controlled because they got room and board and a stipend and couldn\u2019t choose to spend the money on something else.&nbsp;</p><p>Most people don\u2019t say that a scholarship offering to pay for room and board is somehow bad because the student could have used that money to spend less on a room or paid for a different room.&nbsp;</p><p>Sure, everybody would&nbsp;<i>prefer&nbsp;</i>that.

I regret contributing another long and involved comment to this discourse, but I feel like \u201cactually assessing the claims\u201d has been underrepresented compared to people going to the meta level, people discussing the post\u2019s rhetoric, and people simply asserting that this evidence is conclusive proof that Alice and Chloe lied.</p><p>My process of thinking through this has made me wish more receipts from Alice and Chloe were included in Ben\u2019s post, or even just that more of the accusations had come in their own words, because then it would be clear exactly what they were claiming. (I think their claims being filtered through first Ben and then Kat/Emerson causes some confusion, as others have noted).</p><p>I want to talk about some parts of the post and why I\u2019m not convinced. To avoid cherry-picking, I chose the first claim, about whether Alice was asked to travel with illegal drugs (highlighted by Kat as \u201cif you read just one illustrative story, read this one\u201d), and then I used a random number generator to pick two pages in the appendix (following the lead of other commenters).</p><p>I worry that the following will seem maximally negative. But I don\u2019t mean I am strongly convinced of the more negative interpretations I suggest; just that a lot of the screenshots are consistent with Alice and Chloe\u2019s claims being true. This should be read in the spirit of red-teaming or spot-checking, rather than me offering a figured-out narrative.</p><p>Was Alice asked to bring drugs across borders illegally?</p><p>Ben wrote: \u2018Before she went on vacation, Kat requested that Alice bring a variety of illegal drugs across the border for her (some recreational, some for productivity). Alice argued that this would be dangerous for her personally, but Emerson and Kat reportedly argued that it is not dangerous at all and was \u201cabsolutely risk-free\u201d. Privately, Drew said that Kat would \u201clove her forever\u201d if she did this. I bring this up as an example of the sorts of requests that Kat/Emerson/Drew felt comfortable making during Alice\u2019s time there.\u2019</p><p>As evidence against this, Kat offers screenshots showing Drew asking Alice to pick up some medicine. When Alice reports that a prescription is needed and says she is too sick to ask around extensively, Drew says not to worry, and hopes she gets better soon.</p><p>Does this prove that Alice wasn\u2019t asked to bring drugs across borders illegally?<br>No: just because on this occasion Drew didn\u2019t push the issue, doesn\u2019t mean she wasn\u2019t asked to do illegal things on other, different occasions.</p><p>Note that the exchange is with Drew, who was dating Alice for some of the time, and who as far as I know no-one has made any negative allegations about. This exchange doesn\u2019t have any bearing on whether similar exchanges with Kat or Emerson involved more pressure on Alice. The texts also don\u2019t show whether it would have been legal for her to travel with the medicine to where Nonlinear were based, even if she could purchase it without a prescription where she was.</p><p>I realise that it\u2019s actually nigh-on impossible for Nonlinear to prove they never asked Alice to do anything illegal! They\u2019d have to show their entire message history, and even then, Alice could claim that the conversation happened in person. So maybe this is the best evidence they could have included. But just because it\u2019s the best evidence we could hope for, doesn\u2019t mean we should accept it as knock-down, irrefutable evidence that Alice lied; that requires believing that this is the incident Alice was referring to in her conversations with Ben, which is not clear to me.</p><p>Spot checks: p 52</p><p>From the appendix:<br>\u2018Alice says \u201clook at this screenshot - it\u2019s proof that Kat is trying to silence me by withholding my pay!\u201d But Alice strategically cropped this screenshot.\u2019<br><br>This is the screenshot that was included in Ben\u2019s original post, when Alice says she is figuring out \u2018survival stuff\u2019 and Kat appears to make her silence about her experience a condition of offering her help. In the appendix, Kat shows more context; she shows that she proactively reached out to Alice, suggested some free accommodation (like the EA hotel) and a mental health resource. She comments:<br>\u201cThis, by the way, is a perfect example of how Alice spreads falsehoods. They\u2019re mostly lying by omission. She\u2019ll say something that is true (the cropped screenshot), but not show the rest. And the rest will totally flip the sign of the whole accusation.\u201d</p><p>I disagree that the rest flips the sign of the accusation. I think these messages are consistent with Kat\u2019s story: that Alice was mentally unwell and spreading (false) bad stories, and Kat genuinely wanted to help her while preventing her from spreading lies. I also think they\u2019re consistent with Alice\u2019s story; that Kat had found out that Alice was telling (true) stories about bad experiences she\u2019d had at Nonlinear, and Kat was trying to persuade her to stop. If you want to persuade someone to stop telling negative stories about you \u2014whether true or false \u2014being helpful and friendly is a good way to do it! Ime it\u2019s much harder to say negative things about someone who is being explicitly very generous to you.&nbsp;</p><p>I guess something that confuses me here about Kat's story is, if Alice was telling lies because of mental illness or a lack of contact with reality, then I\u2019m not sure why Kat expected a commitment from her to mean anything anyway.</p><p>I think it\u2019s right that Ben\u2019s claim that Alice was \u201cin a position of strong need\u201d was stretching it: she does say she\u2019s safe, and \u2018figuring out basic survival stuff\u2019 *could* mean being very needy, but could also mean something less extreme than that.</p><p>Spot check: p. 104<br>from the appendix:<br>\"Kat: It\u2019s incredibly unwise to date your colleague/roommate/boss\u2019s brother who has a different relationship orientation, but it\u2019s up to you. &nbsp;<br>Alice: Kat\u2019s trying to force me to not be poly!\"<br><br>Here Kat gives some evidence that she\u2019s not anti-poly and would never try to interfere with someone\u2019s dating life:</p><p>\u2018For example, around the time Alice alleges that Kat said she couldn\u2019t be poly around her, Kat suggested that Alice might like dating two of her poly friends coming to visit who she knows are looking for a third to form a triad. Also, we\u2019ve invited many poly people to travel with us. Including Alice, who was practicing polyamory the entire time she lived with us. We knew she was poly before she even arrived and were 100% fine with it. She started polyamorously sleeping with multiple of our friends within a week of joining us in Puerto Rico. So clearly we don\u2019t mind having poly people live with us.\u2019</p><p>To say \u2018we can\u2019t be anti-poly because we invited polyamorous Alice to travel with us\u2019 is begging the question, since Alice claimed that Kat asked her to stop being poly and wasn't '100% fine with it'.&nbsp;</p><p>The other parts aren\u2019t strong evidence that Kat did not have the conversation Alice reported. Someone can have a bias or discomfort without that affecting them literally all the time. Lots of people in the EA and AI safety community are poly, so it would be difficult for Nonlinear to avoid asking poly people to travel with them.</p><p>I think it\u2019s reasonable for Kat to discourage Alice from dating Drew \u2014albeit arguably hypocritical, given that Kat and Emerson are a couple and also colleagues, so they clearly can\u2019t think it\u2019s inappropriate in all cases.</p><p>Again, there is probably no way that Kat could actually prove that she never told Alice she shouldn\u2019t be poly! But again, just because this is the best evidence we could reasonably hope for, doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s actually that strong.</p><p>General thoughts<br>This is all tricky, because my impression is that this was always very much about\u2026vibes? (Which partly comes from the fact that I heard about it from Alice and Chloe, rather than Ben\u2019s post). It\u2019s understandable that lots of discussion has been about legible, concrete things: how much were they paid? Were they asked to bring illegal drugs across borders or not? But that legible stuff has always seemed less central than \u2018there were just super toxic interpersonal dynamics at play\u2019. &nbsp;And that\u2019s tricky either way: if Alice and Chloe are telling the truth, it\u2019s tricky because it\u2019s really hard to express \u2018why was it so bad\u2019 (I thought Chloe\u2019s comment about her experience on the weekend day trip was really useful here). And if Kat and Emerson are telling the truth, it\u2019s hard to argue against a vibe, or to argue that the vibe came from unreasonable interpretations or expectations on the part of Alice and Chloe. In general, it just seems really, really hard to think clearly about situations like this. My sympathies to everyone involved.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Amber"}}, {"_id": "QNvwmGc3S4xnv7NKj", "postedAt": "2023-12-19T20:06:50.469Z", "postId": "H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC", "htmlBody": "<p>You and I don't disagree.

And I was acknowledging that things can take years to come out, that is how these things can happen, so even though it has been a decade, I would support if something came out. I added in that edit out of raw fear that people would misunderstand me and I would get cancelled. But somehow you have taken that edit as proof of something very different, almost the opposite, the opinion that \"if we haven't heard about an incident for ten years, that means that a group doesn't still have a problem.\" That is an opinion that I don't hold, and yeah which I could be unduly cancelled for, so I guess my edit got me into <i>hotter </i>water. Sigh.</p><p>Again, I don't think it's impossible that something bad occurred. But if you read the FB thread, the <i>one</i> now-27 yo (then 25 I think)<strong> remarks on it in a very unperturbed fashion </strong>and also claims they were the only minor. That was the more important thing that made it \"not damning\". And less so the time gap, although the two bits look strong put together I guess. IMO at this point it is violating privacy to <i>assume</i> bad things happen and go spreading such links.<br><br>And again, I don't think it's impossible there is a current problem worse than other communities.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftokk90dmjj\"><sup><a href=\"#fntokk90dmjj\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Or that the group doesn't \"still\" have a problem.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefad3yjcccwp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnad3yjcccwp\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I agree, there <i>could</i> be \"a [bigger than average] problem\". I just think there is very, very poor proof of this. And I think you and I would agree that a problem ten years ago, <i><strong>if</strong></i> it was a problem, when you <strong>don't even know who it was </strong>or if they still at work at the same org or in the movement, is generally very bad proof that there is a noteworthy problem today. You might say \"sure but it would be <i>weak</i> proof if it was reported as a problem retroactively!\" Would it? Because I promise you I can walk into any longrunnning <i>large</i> social community and ask them if they had a problem with any man doing messed up things to women in the past ten years, and the answer will be yes. Especially if that community is tens of thousands of people, and especially if you go back to the founding most-casual years of that community before systems inevitably get put in place. Honestly, I'm having a hard time imagining that even, say, Rotary Club, has been exempt in the past decade. They just don't have a culture of airing grievances publicly, which is EA's bread and butter.<br><br>So nothing I have seen, in the density of complaints I have seen over time, including even if that consensual statutory incident was actually problematic, proves <i><strong>or disproves </strong></i>the idea that EA could have a big problem. Thomas was making a positive claim of a big problem, which is why my focus on trying to bring back neutrality could perhaps be misconstrued as arguing for the opposite claim. People are used to seeing two opposite claims duking it out, not just someone trying to return neutrality. So, to make my position abundantly clear, I am not arguing for any particular claim except sharing my own experience as a data point, and I am trying to get other people to stop using bad evidence to back up claims. And using bad evidence naturally means that the claim won't hold up well when you look close, if that poor evidence is all or most of what you have. That doesn't mean I'm trying to prove the opposite of the claim, it means they set up their argument that badly.</p><p>Does EA have a big problem? It's hard to prove one way or another, and <i>it has not been proven</i>. But we will have more data soon. Until then, I would like to remind critics of what <i>definitely</i> matters <i><strong>if they are going to make claims </strong></i>about our community today as though their claims are the unobjectifiable truth: women's safety <strong>today</strong>. That is essentially the only evidence that definitely matters if the claim is not \"EA or rationality <i>used </i>to have a problem\". We should use 5 years past, 10 years past, suspicion of problems to do more digging into whether EA has a current major problem and if so, how our recent systems that focus on sexual misconduct have been inadequate. Which is indeed what is being done.<br><br>Please keep in mind, it is <i><strong>extremely stressful </strong></i>to write the types of comments I wrote above. I do it to try to protect real people and our very real movement from <i>unwarranted hasty kneejerk</i> cancellation, which derails lives, waylays futures, and causes emotional health crises for those effected. Unfortunately, I am well aware that while doing so, I risk such cancellation myself, which is very scary and necessitates (IMO) me writing a cringe novel so people can fully understand the context of my words and not come after me/ruin my future. But the more words I write, the more sentences I create which also demand perfection or risk being nitpicked And people interpret things in different ways, or forget points I make if I haven't revisited it in the last few paragraphs. It would be a lot nicer if people on this forum would afford some grace to those of us who take on this reputational risk for the good of others in the community (and under our real names, so it actually means something). If I saw someone share a letter that was proven to falsely accuse Titotal, I would step in for you too. And wouldn't it annoy you, perhaps even greatly concern you, if, after a defense of you had been mounted, saying validly \"we don't know there was a problem here\", then someone comes in and says \"but there still might be a problem tho\"? Like, yes, but I just want it to sink in with an audience that attacking others, posting proven falsehoods, and making grand unsupported claims about these things is not okay, and let that stand on it's own. I really think EAs should stick up for ourselves and each other here.&nbsp;<br><br><i><strong>A note to forum readers in general: </strong></i>Instead of trying to pick everything apart on the defensive side, where I/people like me are simply trying to add <i>neutrality</i> back in and police interpersonal decency so as to prevent slander and privacy-violations, you could pick apart the other side. The side that initially tries to make active (not neutral) claims which they \"prove\" with blatant falsehoods, outlandishly farfetched speculation, and uncalled-for judgements on people/the movement who are multiple steps removed from theoretical or actual bad situations. I wait a good bit of time usually from when I see an unacceptable comment, but hardly anyone ever steps in. If anyone thinks they can do it better, please do. But right now I have to wonder if I'm one of the few who notices and cares that journalists and people with pitchforks sometimes hang out here, and based on noticing that risk, does time-urgent comms in response to potentially-damaging comments.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefi7clv3c70da\"><sup><a href=\"#fni7clv3c70da\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;We should not expect downvotes and disagreevotes to stop journalists or people with pitchforks--they can just DM the person who got downvoted or copypaste anyway. They can easily use that as proof that EAs just don't want to hear \"valid\" critiques. The truth was that the critiques were not valid, but people will never know unless EA Forum users like you and me respond. Journalists can share the truth if they want, but I can't be the only one who no longer expects journalists to figure out what <i>is </i>true let alone what true things are relevant to a grand thesis. In that case, someone needs to do the factchecking and, frankly, critical thinking for such comments/posts on the spot before gish gallops and the like snowball. This is why I responded to the Kathy Forth stuff and so on and so on to whatever might have slanderous aspects or I see as unfair to others. You can do this too. Please.</p><p>I am sorry for going off here Titotal, but I really don't need the feedback that \"we need to be more careful with statements like this\" or \"X does not mean Y\". I was very careful. And I know that X does not mean Y. It is already nightmare fuel for me that I had that conversation with Thomas all through the weekend, and I tried very hard for many hours, and I only did so for the good of others. Maybe focus on the other side to be careful with their statements. If you want to add or highlight another point, it would be nicer if you check for what I think in the thread, or ask a question of what I really meant, or frame it as a heads up to the audience, rather than (apparently) try to correct me on the one thing in thousands of words you think I might not have gotten.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fntokk90dmjj\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreftokk90dmjj\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Okay I admit I do have strong expectation that EA does not have more <i>assault </i>than other communities, which was the original claim I was pushing back against, but that is still just my belief and I'm still trying to focus on data and wait for more to come out</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnad3yjcccwp\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefad3yjcccwp\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Although I will say that if we have a Bill Cosby in our community, someone who would be doing ongoing bad things for many years and still today, it was probably Brent Dill or Michael Vassar.

In her final month there Kat informed her that while she would work quite independently, they would keep the money in the Nonlinear bank account and she would ask for it, meaning she wouldn\u2019t have the financial independence from them that she had been expecting, and learning this was what caused Alice to quit.</p></blockquote><p>These are the only mentions I can find of Alice running an incubated project.

Which is so strange because we told her again and again and again that it was a project under Nonlinear. That it wasn\u2019t her own organization. And she\u2019d say \u201cYes, I get it.\u201d Then she\u2019d come back a few days later thinking it was hers.</p></blockquote><p>This is supported by a screenshot which shows minutes from a meeting on April 14, 2022, listing Kat as \"Supreme Commander\" and a redacted name (presumably Alice) as \"PM.\"</p><p>Kat also includes a screenshot of a Whatsapp conversation with Alice about her organization/project, the Productivity Fund. The texts show that 1) money for the Productivity Fund was raised from FTX, and 2) Alice could spend money \"as [she] saw fit\" as long as it's within scope for the original application. If she wanted to do something out of scope for the Productivity Fund, she wouldn't be able to use their allocated budget.</p><p>Finally, Kat says Alice wasn't running her own organization, because she was still \"Attending Nonlinear weekly meetings, Getting expenses reimbursed by Nonlinear, Using a Nonlinear email address, Having Chloe, our operations manager, handle her operations\"</p><p>In summary: <strong>Kat says that Alice's project was </strong><i><strong>not</strong></i><strong> an incubated organization at all, but only a project under Nonlinear. But the evidence she cites isn't conclusive either way.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I think this is due to some confusion about how incubation/fiscal sponsorship works. As an example, I run an organization (Asterisk Magazine) which is fiscally sponsored by another organization (Effective Ventures Foundation U.S.). This means that I report to the CEO of EVF, my organization's allocated funding is housed in EVF's bank account, and many of my ops tasks, like accounting and finance, are handled by EVF's staff. However, I have full control over the project I run, and I'm currently in the process of spinning out into a separate organization \u2013&nbsp;at which point the funds I've raised would follow me. In this case, EVF is acting as an incubator to help me get Asterisk off the ground while I build up operational capacity.</p><p>Everything Kat shows here is consistent with Alice running her own incubated organization. It's normal for the head of an incubated organization to report to the CEO of their fiscal sponsor, use their fiscal sponsor's operational resources, and be reimbursed by their fiscal sponsor for expenses. I think that the Whatsapp messages support this interpretation \u2013&nbsp;Kat is telling Alice that she can use the money raised from an outside funder for her organization however she wants, but can't use those funds for other projects (just like I can't use funds allocated for another EVF project to support Asterisk).</p><p>Kat keeps talking about Alice being confused and thinking she was running a \"separate org\" \u2013&nbsp;e.g. &nbsp;\"This is where Alice, again, thinks that it\u2019s a separate organization and that I\u2019ve given her $240,000. Her only evidence for this strange idea is her memory of the conversation\" and \"Alice misunderstood this as it being a separate org again. Maybe it\u2019s because she kept getting confused about the possibility of spinning out in the future?\" But it's really unclear to me if Alice ever believed this, or if she thought she was running a <i>fiscally sponsored organization</i> which would one day be independent and whose budget she controlled. This is what Ben's original post says, and nothing here disproves that interpretation.</p><p>On the other hand, there is a fair amount of evidence suggesting that at the time, Nonlinear and Alice both understood Alice to be incubating her own organization.</p><p>Here's Alice's job description from Nonlinear's website at the time she worked there:<br><br><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cGRxpD6Gocd6j3nxf/qjlkrjowse4jem9tsvd9\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cGRxpD6Gocd6j3nxf/zuzgytitnt7kdfagirfz 139w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cGRxpD6Gocd6j3nxf/zykri8qrnysgqutbmxne 219w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cGRxpD6Gocd6j3nxf/kgasy7mz9yyjjoi83tqa 299w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cGRxpD6Gocd6j3nxf/ldejszfxvtbaotexx3qd 379w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cGRxpD6Gocd6j3nxf/qffumbr33zjinceguxix 459w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cGRxpD6Gocd6j3nxf/vvwvgvctiqcjxsjmb8k2 539w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cGRxpD6Gocd6j3nxf/v9mukblep8o5joo6zqlc 619w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cGRxpD6Gocd6j3nxf/qemygt3opxbasx6mmczz 699w\"></p><p>(Note: This screenshot comes from an archived version of Nonlinear's about page. I'm not providing a link because this would reveal Alice's identity, and I strongly urge everyone reading this not to use this information to dox her. I realize posting this at all caries some doxxing risk, and if mods want me to take it down of course I'll do so.)</p><p>Here, Alice is clearly referred to as a incubatee building up her own project, though the project listed here (Idea Market) is different from the project Kat discusses (Productivity Fund). This listing also seems to use incubatee and project manager interchangeably, which could contribute to the confusion over how much independence Alice was supposed to have.</p><p>There's also <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/aoZfdTMo9xkLcBNJS/field-specific-le-longterm-entrepreneurship#Z9aenmBBFsn44kHKe\">an EA forum comment</a> from Kat talking about incubating a \"promising woman\" to run an unspecified charity. Based on the dates, I think this has to be referring to Alice.&nbsp;</p><p>[EDIT: a friend points out that Kat refers to Alice as an independent founder in the appendix, too. \"Some of Alice\u2019s stories suddenly make no sense when you know she only worked for us for 4 months, and the plan was she\u2019d soon leave to start her own charity - the opposite of controlling\" (page 22), \"Even though she was there as a friend, Emerson was not charging her rent and was covering groceries while she, a founder, figured out what x-risk charity to start next\" (page 22), \"We thought [Alice] might spin [the Productivity Fund] out, depending on how it goes, in like, 6 months to 1.5 years maybe\" (page 96). All of this seems to suggest an environment where it was generally assumed that Alice was running her own project that she was planning to spin out! I can see why the situation might seem unclear to her.]<br>&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, I'm pretty confused. Alice's bio refers to the \"Idea Market\" and clearly lists this as her incubated organization. Ben's post also refers to Alice's incubated organization, and says that it had a &nbsp;budget of $100k. But Kat's post refers to the \"Productivity Fund,\" which has a budget of $240k. &nbsp;It's unclear to me if these are separate projects with their own budgets, or if the scope and nature of Alice's project changed while she worked at nonlinear.</p><p>In either case, it seems disingenuous of Kat to express total befuddlement at Alice's belief that she was running her own incubated org. It might be that Kat is using a nonstandard definition of \"incubate\" that includes projects that remain within Nonlinear and never become independent, but this seems inconsistent with Nonlinear's description of their incubation program on their current home page, which does explicitly talk about launching new charities:</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;Our goal is to 10x the number of talented people working on x-risk by launching dozens of high impact charities.&nbsp;This helps solve the bottlenecks because entrepreneurs \u201cunlock\u201d latent EA talent -&nbsp;if one person starts an organization that employs 100 people who weren\u2019t previously working on AI safety, that doubles the number of people working on the problem.</p></blockquote><p>It seems very likely to me that both Alice and Kat were confused about what being an incubated organization entailed, and had trouble communicating their expectations with each other.</p><p>On the other hand, looking at the public descriptions of Alice's project and Alice's role, I'm troubled by how Nonlinear characterizes it in this rebuttal. The rebuttal makes it sound like Alice would have to be delusional or dishonest to understand the project as \"her incubated project\", and also claims that the only record of this is Alice's (presumed suspect) memory, when there's in fact documentation that Alice was supposed to be incubating a project. I find this especially concerning because it's part of a larger pattern of Nonlinear mischaracterizing statements by Ben, Alice, or Chloe, which has been pointed out in other spot-checks and leaves me with very serious doubts about their integrity.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Clara Collier"}}, {"_id": "AFadSacdmgevbnfkE", "postedAt": "2023-12-22T13:16:59.578Z", "postId": "H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>Alice's bio refers to the \"Idea Market\" and clearly lists this as her incubated organization.</p></blockquote><p>It doesn\u2019t.

Ben never claims, and never claims that Alice claimed, that she had a fully independent entity of this type. When he says she \"gave Nonlinear ownership\" of the organization, I did not read that as him saying that she transferred legal control of an indendent entity, &nbsp;but ceded practical control of the project she was incubating inside Nonlinear.

During our conversations, I felt listened to, and she directly addressed the challenges I communicated. What particularly stood out was Kat\u2019s energy and enthusiasm which are infectious. Starting a new organization is challenging, and I remember a call where I felt somewhat discouraged about a development at my project. After the call, I felt re-energized and gained new perspectives on tackling the issues we discussed. She encouraged me to reach out again if I needed further discussion which made me feel supported.</p><p>Having someone to bounce ideas off, especially someone who has co-founded multiple organizations is incredibly helpful. Kat's directness was both amusing and beneficial in ensuring clear communication. This frank approach is refreshing compared to the often indirect and confusing hints others may give.</p><p>A significant aspect of coaching is understanding the coachee's needs in depth to provide tailored solutions. Different coaching styles work for different people. In my case, while I felt listened to, the coaching could have been even more effective if Kat had spent more time initially asking questions. This would have allowed for a more nuanced understanding before she passionately began offering resources and solutions to my problems. However, this point didn't detract from the overall value of the calls. I always felt that I made significant progress and found the calls highly beneficial.&nbsp;</p><p>Another aspect of my interaction with Kat that I greatly appreciated was her warm and bubbly nature. This demeanor added a sense of comfort and positivity to our discussions. Working on reducing existential risks can often be a daunting and emotionally taxing endeavor. It's rare to find someone who can blend professional insight with a genuinely uplifting attitude, and Kat does this exceptionally well. Her ability to lighten the mood without undermining the seriousness of the topics we discussed was a skill that significantly enhanced the coaching experience.</p><p>Overall, I would rate her 9 out of 10, considering these points. I am grateful for having had the opportunity to receive guidance and coaching from Kat and hope that she can assist many more individuals in their efforts to do good better.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Johan de Kock"}}, {"_id": "FH4HLGnsvAB56KaDD", "postedAt": "2023-12-29T01:35:44.139Z", "postId": "H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC", "htmlBody": "<p>Sorry Habryka!
