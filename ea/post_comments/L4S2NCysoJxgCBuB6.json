Gossip can have an important community function - at the very least, from this comment you can conclude that things happened at Nonlinear which induced people (in fact, many people) to negatively gossip about the organization - but should also be treated as different from hard accusations, especially those backed by publicly available evidence.  In the wake of the FTX fiasco, I think it's likely that people are more inclined to treat gossip of the sort I share below as decisive.</p>\n<p>That said, I do think that the gossip below paints a basically accurate picture. I also have other reasons to distrust Nonlinear that I don't feel comfortable sharing (more gossip!). I know this is hard epistemic territory to work in, and I'm sorry. I would feel best about this situation if someone from, e.g., CEA would talk to some of the people involved, but I'm sure anyone who could deal with this is swamped right now. In the meantime, I think it's fine for this gossip to make you unsure about Nonlinear, but still  e.g. consider applying to them for emergency funding.

I have general sense that they had a pattern of taking on young, idealistic  interns with poor ability to stand up for themselves and exploiting them to a standard many would consider unacceptable (e.g. manipulating them into accepting unreasonably little pay, and sometimes not following through on payment when they thought they could get away with it).</p>\n<p>As I understand things, in July 2022 a group of Nonlinear employees and interns quit because they were unhappy with either their own treatment or the treatment of their coworkers.</p>\n<p>I've also heard that Emerson can be retributive, and that some people around Nonlinear were scared about Emerson finding out they'd spoken badly about him.

Like, actual nightmares while I'm asleep. There are some seriously manipulative, narcissists at Dose. If you are a semi-decent person who cares even an inkling about your own well being or the well being of others, I highly suggest staying away from this insane company.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Dose-RVW23841412.htm\"><strong>Yikes.</strong></a><strong> </strong>Working at Dose is like being in a sorority who thinks they're really cool, popular and making a difference in the world, but are so blinded by their own delusions and egos, that it couldn't be further from the truth. Specifically, I'm talking specifically about upper management. The \"leaders\" not only have no clue what they're doing, but they refuse to listen to other people's opinions and play favorites. If you're not extroverted or as \"hyped\" about the company, you\u2019ll become less respected. Those who can speak their language of BS buzzwords with enthusiasm are those who get promotions, get invited to happy hours, etc.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Dose-RVW68359722.htm\"><strong>Stepping Stone Job</strong></a><strong> </strong>Toxic workplace, with little to no career pathway. Inexperienced management.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Dose-RVW51897116.htm\"><strong>Toxic</strong></a><strong>:</strong>Truly the only way to succeed at dose is to suck up to upper management, as your growth there will depend more on how well you manage to befriend the higher ups than your actual work ethic. Beware: lack of training, constant gaslighting, putting people on the spot [...] are the norm. Dose acts like it's fun and cool but there is a reason why half the team quit [...]. Also, there is rampant nepotism at dose, with the CEO hiring many of his friends that aren't actually competent (and you can't really say anything because they are friends and there is NO HR - big red flag). I could go on, but in general, upper management at dose is stuck in a high school mean girl attitude and it seems that will never change. if you're looking to 1up your career, use them for a period of time and then get out. Otherwise, run far far away. The managers put on an amazing front of being friendly and will tell you things like oh your mental health is important etc etc so you think it's this amazing place, but it's really not.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Dose-RVW43169466.htm\"><strong>Progressive Company?</strong></a><strong> </strong>No amount of snacks make up for the toxic and traumatizing workplace environment nurtured here. The leadership micromanaged, gaslit and blamed everything and everyone but themselves while team members quit one after the other and the remaining unrealistic workload fell on fewer and fewer shoulders. The expectation was that working \u201cjust\u201d 40 hours a week wasn\u2019t enough. On any given week in the office, the chances were pretty high that someone would end up crying, screaming or melting down. All this from a company that once called itself \u201cprogressive.\u201d Also, from a diversity perspective, look out if you are a person of color. The sometimes \u201csubtle\u201d and often explicit racism and prejudice I witnessed had real impacts on many careers, kept promising candidates away and sent talented professionals to the door. Everyone was aware this was happening and nothing was done. This is not a progressive company and I don't think it's an ethical one. Maybe things have changed. I hope they will. Advice to Management: Try kindness, trust people and believe what they tell you. do something</li><li><a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Dose-RVW38897327.htm\"><strong>A discouraging place to work</strong></a><strong> </strong>Toxic work environment -Lack of infrastructure -Burnout galore. Witnessed employees having crying breakdowns at least half a dozen times due to the pressure and workload. -Unpaid overtime -Tight deadlines for a high volume of work -Too many cooks in the kitchen/top-heavy upper management/everyone wants to feel important -No matter how hard you work or how much you accomplish, unless you're willing to consistently be on call past working hours, your work is seen as lacking,&nbsp;or, at best, on par. -The other reviews say it all. The goalposts are always changing, workflow is chaotic, and everyone is overworked. Advice to Management: &nbsp;Stop taking miles when your employees offer inches. When you're a decade-old company, the \"we're a scrappy startup\" line comes off as a glib excuse to treat your employees like workhorses. Deliver when you say you care about your employees' well-being by creating actionable solutions instead of just doing damage control and trying to placate them when things get especially bad. Hire more people, especially creatives, to handle the workload or stop overpromising to clients.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-Dose-RVW36379176.htm\"><strong>Values their clients more than their employees</strong></a><strong> </strong>Toxic culture - Expected to work overtime without extra pay - Our mistakes are called out constantly, but our hard work is rarely acknowledged - Management often changes the organizational structure/goals of the company, which results in disorganization and more stress. - Creatives (designers and copywriters) are not being heard by upper management. No matter what the client asks for, management says yes without even thinking about the capabilities or bandwidth of their creative team. This often results in creatives spending an unnecessary amount of hours bending over backwards to execute something. - At least half of the company has had one foot out the door for the past 6 months. There is nobody here who enjoys this company. - Don't work here unless you want to be belittled, stretched too thin, and undervalued. Advice to Management: It's not enough to just say \"I hear you\" when your employees are expressing their concerns. Stop telling them to \"be agile.\" Listen to them, believe that they know what they're talking about, and learn how to push back to your clients when necessary. Your employees are exhausted and unhappy.

Since this thread is clearly picking up again, I\u2019d like to provide my perspective as someone who\u2019s worked at Nonlinear, and on the Emergency Fund. First, context:&nbsp;</p><ol><li><strong>All this is my own experience and opinion.</strong> The fact that I had overall positive experiences does not invalidate someone else\u2019s negative experience. I admit it\u2019s \u2026 not a good look to have such a high rate of strong negative sentiment.</li><li><strong>I\u2019ve been working with Nonlinear for ~3 months.</strong> About 80% of my interaction is with Drew Spartz&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefr8k5xqsmzk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnr8k5xqsmzk\">[1]</a></sup></span>and Luca (the other intern). The other 20% is Kat who I\u2019ve had one 2-hour meeting with when planning the Nonlinear Emergency Fund and text correspondence/coordination as Nonlinear processes applications. I have never interacted with Emerson.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>What I can do is provide additional context. So far, we\u2019ve received ~40 applications for the Nonlinear Emergency Fund. Kat has been personally following up on requests, coordinating with external funders and handling relevant documents for dozens of grantees. To my knowledge, ~10 of the most time-sensitive requests have been approved. The responsibility is kind of insane, since improper follow-up/delay has immediate consequences on the grantee\u2019s end. About 8 requests indicated they needed to hear back in less than a week, and the shortest was less than three days.</p><p><u>Motivations behind the Emergency Fund</u><br>Keep in mind that none of this is something Nonlinear actually has to do. There\u2019s practically no direct impact to us, and the emergency funding we give out are, to my knowledge, unconditional. I did see one grant that stipulated additional non-emergency funding contingent on producing policy-actionable research, but that doesn\u2019t benefit Nonlinear either.</p><p>During the 2-hour call when Kat, Luca and I discussed the Emergency Fund, the 2 main focuses were:</p><ol><li><strong>Prioritising immediate financial/personal emergencies of grantees</strong></li><li><strong>Prioritising counterfactual impact on EA work</strong> This means bridge-funding projects/work that would otherwise have to be stopped as grantees have to cease their work. I won\u2019t give names, but let\u2019s just say I was very surprised to see projects I\u2019d used before/applied to.</li></ol><p>At no point did I hear ulterior motives. And frankly, I feel like launching an emergency fund of your own money, when you don\u2019t have to, isn\u2019t the kind of thought process a selfish opportunist jumps at.</p><p><u>Implications</u><br>Also, keep in mind that, at the time:</p><ol><li><strong>Nonlinear also lost $250k in funding from FTX Future Fund.</strong> I have been told some of the team also had larger personal funds on FTX. If anything, FTX is paying Nonlinear if clawbacks occur.</li><li><strong>Kat was entirely focused on the community.</strong> Video calling someone on a treadmill while she earnestly details plans to distribute six figures in emergency funding, right after a third of EA funding vanished overnight, is a very surreal experience.</li><li><strong>Kat had no reassurance that any other funders would also step up for any of the grantees.</strong> Hence the explicit assumption was that Nonlinear\u2019s founders would self-fund the grantees out of their own pockets.
