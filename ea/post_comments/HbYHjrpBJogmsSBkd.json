For example, we think that we could do more to make our site helpful and appealing to mid-career people (it can be off-putting for them currently due to a vibe of treating the reader like a 'blank slate'), and my current guess is that our marginal resources would be better put there in the near future vs. doing more neartermist content.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Ardenlk"}}, {"_id": "K5jtLDrc3Cmpcetn6", "postedAt": "2023-09-30T16:10:18.829Z", "postId": "HbYHjrpBJogmsSBkd", "htmlBody": "<p>(I work at 80,000 Hours but on the 1on1 side rather than website.)
