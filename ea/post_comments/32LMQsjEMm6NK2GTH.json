I've spoken to \"Alice\" (both while she worked at nonlinear and afterward), Kat (throughout&nbsp;the period when the events in the post were alleged to have happened and afterward), Emerson, Drew, and (recently) the author Ben, as well as, to a much lesser extent, \"Chloe\" (when she worked at nonlinear). I am (to my knowledge) on friendly terms with everyone mentioned (by name or pseudonym) in this post. I wish well for everyone involved. I also want the truth to be known, whatever the truth is.</p><p>I was sent a nearly final draft of this post yesterday (Wednesday), once by Ben and once by another person mentioned in the post.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>I want to say that I find this post extremely strange&nbsp;for the following reasons:<br>&nbsp;</p><p>(1)<strong> The nearly final draft of this post that I was given yesterday had factual inaccuracies that (in my opinion and based on my understanding of the facts) are very serious</strong> despite ~150 hours being spent on this investigation. This makes it harder for me to take at face value the parts of the post that I have no knowledge of. &nbsp;Why am I, an outsider on this whole thing, finding serious errors in the final hours before publication? That's not to say everything in the post is inaccurate, just that I was disturbed to see serious inaccuracies, and I have no idea why nobody caught these (I really don't feel like I should be the one to correct mistakes, given my lack of involvement, but it feels important to me to comment here since I know there were inaccuracies in the piece, so here we are).<br>&nbsp;</p><p>(2) <strong>Nonlinear reached out to me and told me they have proof that&nbsp;a bunch&nbsp;of claims in the post are completely false</strong>. They also said that in the past day or so (upon becoming aware of the contents of the post), they asked Ben to delay his publication of this post by one week so that they could gather their evidence and show it to Ben before he publishes it (to avoid having him publish false information). However, he refused to do so.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>This really confuses me. Clearly, Ben spent a huge amount of time on this post (which has presumably involved weeks or months of research), so why not wait one additional week for Nonlinear to provide what they say is proof that his post contains substantial misinformation?&nbsp;Of course, if the evidence provided b<u>y</u>&nbsp;nonlinear&nbsp;is weak, he should&nbsp;treat it as such, but if it is strong, it should also be treated as such. I struggle to wrap my head around the&nbsp;decision&nbsp;not to look at that evidence. I am also confused why Ben, despite spending a huge amount of time on this research, apparently didn't seek out this evidence from Nonlinear long ago.</p><p>To clarify: I think it\u2019s very important in situations like this not to let the group being criticized have a way to delay publication indefinitely. If I were in Ben\u2019s shoes, I believe what I would have done is say something like, \u201cYou have exactly one week to provide proof of any false claims in this post (and I\u2019ll remove any claim you can prove is false) then I\u2019m publishing the post no matter what at that time.\u201d This is very similar to the policy we use for our Transparent Replications project (where we replicate psychology results of publications in top journals), and we have found it to work well. We give the original authors a specific window of time during which they can point out any errors we may have made (which is at least a week). This helps make sure our replications are accurate, fair, and correct, and yet the teams being replicated have no say over whether the replications are released (they always are released regardless of whether we get a response).<br>&nbsp;</p><p>It seems to me that basic norms of good epistemics&nbsp;require that, on important topics, you look at all the evidence that can be easily acquired.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>I also think that if you publish&nbsp;misinformation, you can't just undo it by updating the post later or issuing a correction. Sadly, that's not the way human minds/social information works. In other words, misinformation can't be jammed back into the bottle once it is released. I have seen numerous cases where misinformation is released only later to be retracted, in which the misinformation got way more attention than the retraction, and most people came away only with the misinformation. This seems to me to provide a strong additional reason why a small delay in the publication date appears well worth it (to me, as an outsider) to help avoid putting out a post with potentially substantial misinformation. I hope that the lesswrong/EA communities will look at all the evidence once it is released, which presumably will be in the next week or so, in order to come to a fair and accurate conclusion (based on all the evidence, whatever that accurate final conclusion turns out to be) and do better than these other cases I\u2019ve witnessed where misinformation won the day.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, I don't know Ben's reason for jumping to publish immediately, so I can't evaluate his reasons directly.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: I am friends with multiple people connected to this post. &nbsp;As a reminder, I wish well for everyone involved, and I wish for the truth to be known, whatever that truth happens to be. I have acted (informally) as an advisor to nonlinear (without pay) - all that means, though, is that every so often, team members there will reach out to me to ask for my advice on things.</p><p>Note: I've updated this comment a few times to try to make my position clearer, to add some additional context, and to fix grammatical mistakes.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "spencerg"}}, {"_id": "gaAD87SmCrjYRadB9", "postedAt": "2023-09-07T07:54:03.492Z", "postId": "32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH", "htmlBody": "<p>This is a short response while I write up something more substantial.&nbsp;</p><p>The true story is very different than the one you just read.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ben Pace&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>purposefully</strong></i><strong> posted this without seeing our evidence first, which I believe is unethical and violates important epistemic norms.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>He said \u201cI don't believe I am beholden to give you time to prepare\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>We told him we have<i> incontrovertible proof</i> that many of the important claims were false or extremely misleading.

My guess is Ben's sources were worried about Emerson hiring stalkers, calling their family, trying to get them fired from their job, or threatening legal action. Having things be out in the public can provide a defense because it is much easier to ask for help if the conflict happens in the open.&nbsp;</p><p>As a concrete example, Emerson has just sent me an email saying:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Given the irreversible damage that would occur by publishing, it simply is inexcusable to not give us a bit of time to correct the libelous falsehoods in this document, and if published as is we intend to pursue legal action for libel against Ben Pace personally and Lightcone for the maximum damages permitted by law. The legal case is unambiguous and publishing it now would both be unethical and gross negligence, causing irreversible damage.</p></blockquote><p>For the record, the threat of libel suit and use of statements like \"maximum damages permitted by law\" seem to me to be attempts at intimidation. Also, as someone who has looked quite a lot into libel law (having been threatened with libel suits many times over the years), describing the legal case as \"unambiguous\" seems inaccurate and a further attempt at intimidation.&nbsp;</p><p>My guess is Ben's sources have also received dozens of calls (as have I received many in the last few hours), and I wouldn't be surprised to hear that Emerson called up my board, or would otherwise try to find some other piece of leverage against Lightcone, Ben, or Ben's sources if he had more time.&nbsp;</p><p>While I am not that worried about Emerson, I think many other people are in a much more vulnerable position and I can really resonate with not wanting to give someone an opportunity to gather their forces (and in that case I think it's reasonable to force the conflict out in the open, which is far from an ideal arena, but does provide protection against many types of threats and adversarial action).</p><p>Separately, the time investment for things like this is really quite enormous and I have found it extremely hard to do work of this type in parallel to other kinds of work, especially towards the end of a project like this, when the information is ready for sharing, and lots of people have strong opinions and try to pressure you in various ways. Delaying by \"just a week\" probably translates into roughly 40 hours of productive time lost, even if there isn't much to do, because it's so hard to focus on other things. That's just a lot of additional time, and so it's not actually a very cheap ask.</p><p>Lastly, I have also found that the standard way that abuse in the extended EA community has been successfully prevented from being discovered is by forcing everyone who wants to publicize or share any information about it to jump through a large number of hoops. Calls for \"just wait a week\" and \"just run your posts by the party you are criticizing\" might sound reasonable in isolation, but very quickly multiply the cost of any information sharing, and have huge chilling effects that prevent the publishing of most information and accusations. Asking the other party to just keep doing a lot of due diligence is easy and successful and keeps most people away from doing investigations like this.&nbsp;</p><p>As I have written about before, I myself ended up being intimidated by this for the case of FTX and chose not to share my concerns about FTX more widely, which I continue to consider one of the worst mistakes of my career.</p><p>My current guess is that if it is indeed the case that Emerson and Kat have clear proof that a lot of the information in this post is false, then I think they should share that information publicly. Maybe on their own blog, or maybe here on LessWrong or on the EA Forum. It is also the case that rumors about people having had very bad experiences working with Nonlinear are already circulating around the community and this is already having a large effect on Nonlinear, and as such, being able to have clear false accusations to respond against should help them clear their name, if they are indeed false.</p><p>I agree that this kind of post can be costly, and I don't want to ignore the potential costs of false accusations, but at least to me it seems like I want an equilibrium of substantially more information sharing, and to put more trust in people's ability to update their models of what is going on, and less paternalistic \"people are incapable of updating if we present proof that the accusations are false\", especially given what happened with FTX and the costs we have observed from failing to share observations like this.</p><p>A final point that feels a bit harder to communicate is that in my experience, some people are just really good at manipulation, throwing you off-balance, and distorting your view of reality, and this is a strong reason to not commit to run everything by the people you are sharing information on. A common theme that I remember hearing from people who had concerns about SBF is that people intended to warn other people, or share information, then they talked to SBF, and somehow during that conversation he disarmed them, without really responding to the essence of their concerns. This can take the form of threats and intimidation, or the form of just being really charismatic and making you forget what your concerns were, or more deeply ripping away your grounding and making you think that your concerns aren't real, and that actually everyone is doing the thing that seems wrong to you, and you are going to out yourself as naive and gullible by sharing your perspective.</p><p>[Edit: The closest post we have to setting norms on when to share information with orgs you are criticizing is Jeff Kauffman's <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/f77iuXmgiiFgurnBu/run-posts-by-orgs\">post</a> on the matter. While I don't fully agree with the reasoning within it, in there he says:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Sometimes orgs will respond with requests for changes, or try to engage you in private back-and forth. While you\u2019re welcome to make edits in response to what you learn from them, you don\u2019t have an obligation to: it\u2019s fine to just say \u201cI\u2019m planning to publish this as-is, and I\u2019d be happy to discuss your concerns publicly in the comments.\u201d<br><br>[EDIT: I\u2019m not advocating this for cases where you\u2019re worried that the org will retaliate or otherwise behave badly if you give them advance warning, or for cases where you\u2019ve had a bad experience with an org and don\u2019t want any further interaction. For example, I expect Curzi didn\u2019t give Leverage an opportunity to prepare a response to My Experience with Leverage Research, and that\u2019s fine.]</p></blockquote><p>This case seems to me to be fairly clearly covered by the second paragraph, and also, Nonlinear's response to \"I am happy to discuss your concerns publicly in the comments\" was to respond with \"I will sue you if you publish these concerns\", to which IMO the reasonable response is to just go ahead and publish before things escalate further. Separately, my sense is Ben's sources really didn't want any further interaction and really preferred having this over with, which I resonate with, and is also explicitly covered by Jeff's post.</p><p>So in as much as you are trying to enforce some kind of existing norm that demands running posts like this by the org, I don't think that norm currently has widespread buy-in, as the most popular and widely-quoted post on the topic does not demand that standard (I separately think the post is still slightly too much in favor of running posts by the organizations they are criticizing, but that's for a different debate).]</p>", "parentCommentId": "75GmvRBw9sRufYzFk", "user": {"username": "Habryka"}}, {"_id": "T8YtfvmtHcvo7nwTh", "postedAt": "2023-09-07T08:21:00.057Z", "postId": "32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH", "htmlBody": "<p>Could this be an instance of the rationalist tendency to \"<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/7cAsBPGh98pGyrhz9/decoupling-vs-contextualising-norms\">decouple</a>\"?</p><p>From one perspective, Ben is simply \"Sharing information about nonlinear.\" What's wrong with providing additional information?

It was extremely positive. She was very committed to frugality, and she initially offered me the position of Associate Director at a salary of $25K/year, the bottom end of the advertised salary range. We exchanged several long emails discussing the tradeoffs in a higher or lower salary (team morale, risk of value drift, resources available for the core work, counterfactual use of funds, etc.). The correspondence felt like a genuine, collaborative search for the truth. I had concluded that I needed to make at least $45K/year to feel confident I was saving the minimum I would need in retirement, and in the end we agreed on $45K.

But after reading the above, it's up to you. <i>I might advise the median EA not to work for them and I'd advise them not to hire people unless they are pretty hard-nosed though seemingly Kat has said she would change things anyway.</i></li></ul></li><li>I am pretty curious about <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/spencerg?mention=user\">@spencerg</a>'s statement that many simple errors were wrong with a recent draft this.

Maybe 20% that there would be.&nbsp;</li><li>I guess most people think that is above the acceptable tolerance.</li><li>I think it's above tolerance for me too. It seems much higher than any other org I can think of. Notably it seems very avoidable.</li><li>I guess I do think things trade off against one another and maybe I'd like a way for us to say \"this org is really effective but we don't recommend most people work for them\". <i>This is the sort of stance many have towards non-safety AI work as a means to upskill</i></li><li>I think rather than this being seen as punishment it can be seen as acceptable boundary setting - communities are allowed to want people given status and others not. This action will lower Nonlinear's status and as a group we can choose to do that. Generally I think about things in terms of bad/unacceptable behaviour rather than bad people and I think a community gets to set the level of predictable bad behaviour it is exposed to.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>What could Nonlinear do to convince me that they deserve the same levels of easy trust as other EA orgs?&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkivpe5dfvuq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkivpe5dfvuq\">[1]</a></sup></span><ul><li>Provide evidence that this article is deeply flawed</li><li>Not threaten to sue Lightcone for publishing it</li><li>Acknowledge the patterns of behaviour that led to these outcomes and how they have changed - <i>this would probably involve acknowledging that lots of these events took place</i></li><li>They could just decide that they don't want this - they want to work in a different way to how EA orgs tend to, and that's fine-adjacent, but then I would recommend they be treated differently too.

A lot of the things that (no one is disputing) happened here are professionally weird; for example, these anecdotes from Ben's summary of Nonlinear's response (also the linked <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20211022160447/https://www.nonlinear.org/operations.html\">job ad</a>):</p><ul><li>\"Our intention wasn't just to have employees, but also to have members of our family unit who we traveled with and worked closely together with in having a strong positive impact in the world, and were very personally close with.\"</li><li>\"We wanted to give these employees a pretty standard amount of compensation, but also mostly not worry about negotiating minor financial details as we traveled the world.

In general we didn't push hard on this.\"</li></ul><p>I am reminded again that, while many professional norms are stupid, a lot of them exist for good reasons. Further, I think it's often pretty easy to disentangle the stupid professional norms from the reasonable professional norms by just thinking: \"Are there good reasons this norm exists?\" (E.g., \"Is there a reason employees and employers shouldn't live together?\" Yes: the power dynamics inherent to the employer/employee dynamic are at odds with healthy roommate dynamics, in which people generally shouldn't have lots of power over one another. \"Is there a reason I should have to wear high heels to work in an office?\" .... no.) Trying to make employees part of your family unit, not negotiating financial details with your employees, covering your employees' rent and groceries, and being in any way involved in your employees breaking the law are all behaviors that are at odds with standard professional practices, and there are very obviously good reasons for this.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "hobbes"}}, {"_id": "bgeiiymDptbka3hbq", "postedAt": "2023-09-07T13:55:54.166Z", "postId": "32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH", "htmlBody": "<p>There are so many things wrong with this post that I'm not entirely sure where to start. Here are a few key thoughts on this:</p><p>-EA preaches rationalism. As part of rationalism, to understand something truly, you need to investigate both sides of the argument. Yet the author specifically decided to only look at one side of the argument. How can that possibly be a rationalist approach to truth-seeking? If you're going to write a defamation article about someone, especially in EA, please make sure to go about it with the logical rigor you would give any issue.&nbsp;</p><p>-I've been working with Kat and Nonlinear for years now and I heard about the hiring process, the employment issues, and the nasty separation. I can guarantee you from my perspective as a coach that a good number of the items mentioned here are abjectly false. I think the worst mistake Kat made was to not have a contract in writing with both of her employees (Chloe's agreement was in writing) detailing the terms of their work engagement.</p><p>-I'm not seeing information collected from other Nonlinear employees, which makes me wonder why there's a biased sample data here. Again, if you're spending the amount of time and effort as was put into this post to defame someone, choose an appropriate data sample.</p><p>-Have you ever been through or seen people go through a divorce? Nasty splits happen all the time, and the anger can cloud retrospective judgment.

I briefly met Kat and Emerson while visiting in Puerto Rico and had positive interactions with them. My personality is such that I have a very strong inclination to try to see the good in others, which I am aware can bias my views.]<br><br>A few random thoughts related to this post:<br><br>1. I appreciate the concerns over potential for personal retaliation, and the other factors mentioned by <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/habryka?mention=user\">@Habryka</a> and others for why it might be good to not delay this kind of post. I think those concerns and factors are serious and should definitely not be ignored. That said, I want to point out that there's a different type of retaliation in the other direction that posting this kind of thing without waiting for a response can cause: Reputational damage. As others have pointed out, many people seem to update more strongly on negative reports that come first and less on subsequent follow up rebuttals. If it turned out that the accusations are demonstrably false in critically important ways, then even if that comes to light later the reputational damage to Kat, Emerson, and Drew may now be irrevocable.</p><p>Reputation is important almost everywhere, but in my anecdotal experience reputation seems to be even more important in EA than in many other spheres. Many people in EA seem to have a very strong in-group bias towards favoring other \"EAs\" and it has long seemed to me that (for example) getting a grant from an EA organization often feels to be even more about having strong EA personal connections than for other places. (This is not to say that personal connections aren't important for securing other types of grants or deals or the like, and it's definitely not to say that getting an EA grant is only or even mostly about having strong EA connections. But from my own personal experience and from talking to quite a few others both in and out of EA, this is definitely how it feels to me. Note that I have received multiple EA grants in the past, and I have helped other people apply to and receive substantial EA grants.) I really don't like this sort of dynamic and I've low-key complained about it for a long time - it feels unprofessional and raises all sorts of in-group bias flags. And I think a lot of EA orgs feel like they've gotten somewhat better about this over time. But I think it is still a factor.</p><p>Additionally, it sometimes feels to me that EA Forum dynamics tend to lead to very strongly upvoting posts and comments that are critical of people or organizations, especially if they're more \"centrally connected\" in EA, while ignoring or even downvoting posts and comments in the other direction. I am not sure why the dynamic feels like this, and maybe I'm wrong about it really being a thing at all. Regardless, I strongly suspect that any subsequent rebuttal by Nonlinear would receive significantly fewer views and upvotes, even if the rebuttal were actually very strong.</p><p>Because of all this, I think that the potential for reputational harm towards Kat, Emerson, and Drew may be even greater than if this were in the business world or some other community. Even if they somehow provide unambiguous evidence that refutes almost everything in this post, I would not be terribly surprised if their potential to get EA funding going forward or to collaborate with EA orgs was permanently ended. In other words, I wouldn't be terribly surprised if this post spelled the end of their \"EA careers\" even if the central claims all turned out to be false. My best guess is that this is not the most likely scenario, and that if they provide sufficiently good evidence then they'll be most likely \"restored\" in the EA community for the most part, but I think there's a significant chance (say 1%-10%) that this is basically the end of their EA careers regardless of the actual truth of the matter.</p><p>Does any of this outweigh the factors mentioned by <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/habryka?mention=user\">@Habryka</a>? I don't know. But I just wanted to point out a possible factor in the other direction that we may want to consider, particularly if we want to set norms for how to deal with other such situations going forward.</p><p>2. I don't have any experience with libel law or anything of the sort, but my impression is that suing for slander over this kind of piece is very much within the range of normal responses in the business world, even if in the EA world it is basically unheard of. So if your frame of reference is the world outside of EA then suing seems at least like a reasonable response, while if your frame of reference is the EA community then maybe it doesn't. I'll let others weigh in on whether my impressions on this are correct, but I didn't notice others bring this up so I figured I'd mention it.</p><p>3. My general perspective on these kinds of things is that... well, people are complicated. We humans often seem to have this tendency to want our heroes to be perfect and our villains to be horrible. If we like someone we want to think they could never do anything really bad, and unless presented with extremely strong evidence to the contrary we'll look for excuses for their behavior so that it matches our pictures of them as \"good people\". And if we decide that they did do something bad, then we label them as \"bad people\" and retroactively reject everything about them. And if that's hard to do we suffer from cognitive dissonance. (Cf. halo effect.)</p><p>But the reality, at least in my opinion, is that things are more complicated. It's not just that there are shades of grey, it's that people can simultaneously be really good people in some ways and really bad people in other ways. Unfortunately, it's not at all a contradiction for someone to be a genuinely kind, caring, supportive, and absolutely wonderful person towards most of the people in their life, while simultaneously being a sexual predator or committing terrible crimes.</p><p>I'm not saying that any of the people mentioned in this post necessarily did anything wrong at all. My point here is mostly just to point out something that may be obvious to almost all of us, but which feels potentially relevant and probably bears repeating in any case. Personally I suspect that everybody involved was acting in what they perceived to be good faith and are / were genuinely trying to do the right thing, just that they're looking at the situation through lenses based on very different perspectives and experiences and so coming to very different conclusions. (But see my disclaimer at the beginning of this comment about my personality bias coloring my own perspective.)</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "iarwain"}}, {"_id": "XoNpsAckJMyLvaLJK", "postedAt": "2023-09-07T16:22:08.761Z", "postId": "32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH", "htmlBody": "<p>Possibly naive question: if Non-Linear have material that undeniably rebuts these accusations and they only need to sort it out/organize for presentation, why not publish it in a disorganized/scrambled format, sort it out later and then publish clean/sorted out version?

Later on, Kat shared with me and the other 2 finalists that the incubatee changed their mind to focus on another career path. While disclosing that the original funding source might not be available, she encouraged us to try taking on this challenge as she believed we would be doing a lot of good in any case.&nbsp;</p><p>She also provided a small amount of seed funding for our time.

Nonlinear also provided the initial funds enough for us co-founders to be able to work together while doing proper fundraising. As we got enough resources to run the org on our own, our interactions with Nonlinear reduced.</p><p>After several months of doing the recruiting agency work together, the HIRe founders parted ways for other opportunities just before the FTX fiasco. But during the entire time, Nonlinear has been nothing but positive, taking time to catch up with every few weeks as well as get together in EA conferences. In no way were we forced to do anything, and were independent in running the project. There were also no manipulations and confusion regarding \u201cownership\u201d, etc. as we were encouraged by Kat that it was ours to run (even with some disagreements with her advice.)</p><p>[Note that before we decided to take on the recruiting agency work, Kat did not have to spend time and energy encouraging us and at any point could have moved on without much issue as there were no contracts signed (not saying this is a good thing - it would have been better if there were as these are baseline practices).

The law does not strike me as particularly well-calibrated about what promotes good communal epistemics, and I do not see how preventing negative evidence from being spread, which is usually the most undersupplied type of evidence already, helps \"promote better epistemics\". Naively the prior should be that when you suppress information, you worsen the accuracy of people's models of the world.</p><p>As a concrete illustration of this, libel law in the U.S. and the U.K. function very differently. It seems to me that the U.S. law has a much better effects on public discourse, by being substantially harder actually make happen. It is also very hard to sue someone in a foreign court for libel (i.e. a US citizen suing a german citizen is very hard).&nbsp;</p><p>This means we can't have a norm that generically permits libel suits, since U.K. libel suits follow a very different standard than U.S. ones, and we have to decide for ourselves where our standards for information control like this is.&nbsp;</p><p>IMO, both U.S. and UK libel suits should both be very strongly discouraged, since I know of dozens of cases where organizations and individuals have successfully used them to prevent highly important information from being propagated, and I think approximately no case where they did something good (instead organizations that frequently have to deal with libel suits mostly just leverage loopholes in libel law that give them approximate immunity, even when making very strong and false accusations, usually with the clarity of the arguments and the transparency of the evidence taking a large hit).</p>", "parentCommentId": "mPGHDkPh7AGdPWaJE", "user": {"username": "Habryka"}}, {"_id": "b895ffz8EtyHmqoxb", "postedAt": "2023-09-07T17:51:57.758Z", "postId": "32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH", "htmlBody": "<p>To some extent, I agree with this, but I also think it overlooks an important component of how defamation law is used <i>in practice</i> \u2014 which is not to hold people to high epistemic norms but instead to scare them out of harming your reputation regardless of the truth. This is something folks who work on corporate campaigns for farmed animal welfare run into all the time. And, because our legal system is imperfect, it often works. Brian Martin has <a href=\"https://www.bmartin.cc/dissent/documents/defamation.html\">a good write-up</a> on the flaws in our legal system that contribute to this:</p><blockquote><p><i><strong>Cost:</strong></i> If you are sued for defamation, you could end up paying tens of thousands of dollars in legal fees, even if you win. If you lose, you could face a massive pay-out on top of the fees.</p><p>The large costs, due especially to the cost of legal advice, mean that most people never sue for defamation. If you don't have much money, you don't have much chance against a rich opponent, whether you are suing them or they are suing you. Cases can go on for years. Judgements can be appealed. The costs become enormous. Only those with deep pockets can pursue such cases to the end.</p><p>The result is that defamation law is often used by the rich and powerful to deter criticisms. It is seldom helpful to ordinary people whose reputations are attacked unfairly.</p><p><i><strong>Unpredictability:</strong></i><strong> </strong>People say and write defamatory things all the time, but only a very few are threatened with defamation. Sometimes gross libels pass unchallenged while comparatively innocuous comments lead to major court actions. This unpredictability has a chilling effect on free speech. Writers, worried about defamation, cut out anything that might offend. Publishers, knowing how much it can cost to lose a case, have lawyers go through articles to cut out anything that might lead to a legal action. The result is a tremendous inhibition of free speech.</p><p><i><strong>Complexity:</strong></i> Defamation law is so complex that most writers and publishers prefer to be safe than sorry, and do not publish things that are quite safe because they're not sure. Judges and lawyers have excessive power because outsiders cannot understand how the law will be applied. Those who might desire to defend against a defamation suit without a lawyer are deterred by the complexities.</p><p><i><strong>Slowness:</strong></i> Sometimes defamation cases are launched months after the statement in question. Cases often take years to resolve. This causes anxiety, especially for those sued, and deters free speech in the meantime. As the old saying goes, \"Justice delayed is justice denied.\"</p></blockquote><p>I'm not saying this is what's happening here \u2014 I have no idea about the details of any of these allegations. But what if someone did have additional private information about Nonlinear or the folks involved? Unless they are rich or have a sophisticated understanding of the law, the scary lawyer talk from Nonlinear here might deter them from talking about it at all, and I think that's a <i>really bad</i> epistemic norm. This isn't to say \"the EA Forum should be completely insulated from defamation law\" or anything, but in a high-trust community where people will respond to alternatives like publicly sharing counterevidence, threatening lawsuits seems like it might hinder, rather than help, epistemics.</p>", "parentCommentId": "mPGHDkPh7AGdPWaJE", "user": {"username": "Tyler Johnston"}}, {"_id": "LGZnRkg2CErECnxQn", "postedAt": "2023-09-07T17:54:35.845Z", "postId": "32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH", "htmlBody": "<p>Being a close friend of Kat for quite some time, do you believe that your point of view could shed some valuable light on this discussion, or is there a chance folks might see it as an effort to spruce up Kat's or Nonlinear's image?</p><p>In the interest of keeping things on the level, can you confirm whether you were clued in about this situation before making this post?

The best-sounding concepts in the world still have to be tested before we should build lots of infrastructure on them, so I see the prize stuff as a fairly inexpensive experiment, and I think often good coordinators are undervalued. My skepticism is more that despite Nonlinear's high profile as coordinators, I have no evidence of Nonlinear's impact, and I'm unconvinced that they've found good pressure points for coordination in general.

Some posts announce new funding opportunities; we evaluate these in terms of brevity, clarity, relevance, and useful links for applicants. Some posts are introduce a new potential EA cause area; we evaluate them in terms of whether they make a good empirical case for the cause area being large-scope, neglected, and tractable. Some posts raise a theoretical issues in moral philosophy; we evaluate those in terms of technical philosophical criteria such as logical coherence.</p><p>This post by Ben Pace is very unusual, in that it's basically investigative journalism, reporting the alleged problems with one particular organization and two of its leaders. The author doesn't explicitly frame it this way, but in his discussion of how many people he talked to, how much time he spent working on it, and how important he believes the alleged problems are, it's clearly a sort of investigative journalism.</p><p>So, let's assess the post by the usual standards of investigative journalism. I don't offer any answers to the questions below, but I'd like to raise some issues that might help us evaluate how good the post is, if taken seriously as a work of investigative journalism.&nbsp;</p><p>Does the author have any training, experience, or accountability as an investigative journalist, so they can avoid the most common pitfalls, in terms of journalist ethics, due diligence, appropriate degrees of skepticism about what sources say, etc?</p><p>Did the author have any appropriate oversight, in terms of an editor ensuring that they were fair and balanced, or a fact-checking team that reached out independently to verify empirical claims, quotes, and background context? Did they 'run it by legal', in terms of checking for potential libel issues?</p><p>Does the author have any personal relationship to any of their key sources? Any personal or professional conflicts of interest? Any personal agenda? Was their payment of money to anonymous sources appropriate and ethical?</p><p>Were the anonymous sources credible? Did they have any personal or professional incentives to make false allegations? Are they mentally healthy, stable, and responsible? Does the author have significant experience judging the relative merits of contradictory claims by different sources with different degrees of credibility and conflicts of interest?</p><p>Did the author give the key targets of their negative coverage sufficient time and opportunity to respond to their allegations, and were their responses fully incorporated into the resulting piece, such that the overall content and tone of the coverage was fair and balanced?</p><p>Does the piece offer a coherent narrative that's clearly organized according to a timeline of events, interactions, claims, counter-claims, and outcomes? Does the piece show 'scope-sensitivity' in accurately judging the relative badness of different actions by different people and organizations, in terms of which things are actually trivial, which may have been unethical but not illegal, and which would be prosecutable in a court of law?&nbsp;</p><p>Does the piece conform to accepted journalist standards in terms of truth, balance, open-mindedness, context-sensitivity, newsworthiness, credibility of sources, and avoidance of libel? (Or is it a biased article that presupposed its negative conclusions, aka a 'hit piece', 'takedown', or 'hatchet job').</p><p>Would this post meet the standards of investigative journalism that's typically published in mainstream news outlets such as the New York Times, the Washington Post, or the Economist?</p><p>I don't know the answers to some of these, although I have personal hunches about others. But that's not what's important here.&nbsp;</p><p>What's important is that if we publish amateur investigative journalism in EA Forum, especially when there are very high stakes for the reputations of individuals and organizations, we should try to adhere, as closely as possible, to the standards of professional investigative journalism. Why? Because professional journalists have learned, from centuries of copious, bitter, hard-won experience, that it's <i>very</i> hard to maintain good epistemic standards when writing these kinds of pieces, it's very tempting to buy into the narratives of certain sources and informants, it's very hard to course-correct when contradictory information comes to light, and it's very important to be professionally accountable for truth and balance.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "geoffreymiller"}}, {"_id": "jdi9Yt4ADbakkn5zP", "postedAt": "2023-09-07T20:00:23.663Z", "postId": "32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH", "htmlBody": "<p>I'd also be pleased to find out that my understanding is wrong!&nbsp;</p><p>I don't think they're in a position to show that a lot of hurt didn't accrue to the employees, but maybe they can show some ways in which they clearly signaled that they wouldn't try to ruin their employees or intimidate them, such as</p><ul><li>Texts where they told Alice/Chloe &nbsp;\"I understand that you had a horrible experience here, and it's totally fine for you to tell other people that this working/living environment was awful and you've been really hurt by it, and also here's a way in which I'm going to make sure you're better off for having interacted with us\"&nbsp;</li><li>Any writing where Emerson says \"I have used vicious and aggressive business tactics in the past, but to be clear if this work-slash-family situation really burns you, I will not come after you with these tactics even if I strongly disagree with your interpretations of what happened\"&nbsp;</li><li>Or generally some \"philosophy of how to behave with allies\" doc written by Emerson that says something like \"Here are the 48 Laws of Power, and here is my explanation why you should never use these tactics if you want to be trustworthy, and here's why we would never use them in an EA/x-risk/etc context\"</li></ul><p>Then that could change my mind on the intimidation aspect a bunch.

She asks again about Burger King and is told it's inconvenient to get there. &nbsp;Instead, they go to a different restaurant and offer to get her something from the restaurant they went to. Alice looks at the menu online and sees that there are no vegan options. Drew confirms that 'they have some salads' but nothing else for her. She assures him that it's fine to not get her anything.</p><p><br>It seems completely reasonable that Alice remembers this as 'she was barely eating, and no one in the house was willing to go out and get her nonvegan foods' - after all, the end result of all of those message exchanges was no food being obtained for Alice and her requests for Burger King being repeatedly deflected with 'we are down to get anything that isn't fast food' and 'we are down to go anywhere within a 12 min drive' and 'our only criteria is decent vibe + not fast food', after which she fails to find a restaurant meeting those (I note, kind of restrictive if not in a highly dense area) criteria and they go somewhere without vegan options and don't get her anything to eat.&nbsp;<br><br>It also seems totally reasonable that no one at Nonlinear understood there was a problem. Alice's language throughout emphasizes how she'll be fine, it's no big deal, she's so grateful that they tried (even though they failed and she didn't get any food out of the 12/15 trip, if I understand correctly). I do not think that these exchanges depict the people at Nonlinear as being cruel, insane, or unusual as people. But it doesn't seem to me that Alice is lying to have experienced this as 'she had covid, was barely eating, told people she was barely eating, and they declined to pick up Burger King for her because they didn't want to go to a fast food restaurant, and instead gave her very limiting criteria and went somewhere that didn't have any options she could eat'.<br><br>On December 16th it does look like they successfully purchased food for her.&nbsp;<br><br>My big takeaway from these exchanges is not that the Nonlinear team are heartless or insane people, but that this degree of professional and personal entanglement and dependence, in a foreign country, with a young person, is simply a recipe for disaster. Alice's needs in the 12/15 chat logs are acutely not being met. She's hungry, she's sick, she conveys that she has barely eaten, she evidently really wants someone to go to BK and get an impossible burger for her, but (speculatively) because of this professional/personal entanglement, she lobbies for this only by asking a few times why they ruled out Burger King, and ultimately doesn't protest when they instead go somewhere without food she can eat, assuring them it's completely fine. This is also how I relate to my coworkers, tbh - but luckily, I don't live with them and exclusively socialize with them and depend on them completely when sick!!<br><br>Given my experience with talking with people about strongly emotional events, I am inclined towards the interpretation where Alice remembers the 15th with acute distress and remembers it as 'not getting her needs met despite trying quite hard to do so', and the Nonlinear team remembers that they went out of their way that week to get Alice food - which is based on the logs from the 16th clearly true! But I don't think I'd call Alice a liar based on reading this, because she did express that she'd barely eaten and request apologetically for them to go somewhere she could get vegan food (with BK the only option she'd been able to find) only for them to refuse BK because of the vibes/inconvenience.</p>", "parentCommentId": "Ejbe8ukX6FhrfRv5C", "user": {"username": "Kelsey Piper"}}, {"_id": "trpyhuhoku4DvcvHo", "postedAt": "2023-09-07T20:34:28.253Z", "postId": "32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH", "htmlBody": "<p>I appreciate the frame of this post and the question it proposes, it's worth considering.

I have skim read the replies. I'm afraid I am only making this one post because involvement with online debates is very draining for me.</p>\n<p>My post is roughly structured along the lines of:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>My relationship to Kat</li>\n<li>My opinions about Kat's character</li>\n<li>My opinions about EA culture and risky weirdness</li>\n<li>My opinions about how we go about ensuring good practices in EA</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Kat is a good friend, who I trust and think highly of. I have known her personally (rather than as a loose acquaintance, as I did for years prior) since summer 2017. I do not know Emerson or his brother from Adam.</p>\n<p>I see somebody else was asked about declaring interests when they spoke positively about Kat. I have never been employed by Kat. Back in 2017, Charity Science had some legal and operational infrastructure (e.g. charity status, tax stuff) which was hard to arrange. And during that time, .impact - which later became Rethink Charity, collaborated with Charity Science in order to shelter under that charitable status in order to be able to hire people, legally process funds and so forth. So indirectly the entity that employed me was helped out by Charity Science.</p>\n<p>However, I never collaborated in a work sense with Charity Science. Professionally I was employed by Tom Ash to do temporary project coordination on LEAN in 2015/16 while I was completing my PhD. In 2017, LEAN was incorporated into SHIC and rebranded as Rethink Charity, under Tee Barnett and Baxter Bullock. (For those of you who are new, Rethink Priorities incubated with Rethink Charity at it's inception before operational aspects were in place for it to separate, hence the similar name. .impact was also co-founded by Peter Hurford prior to his co-launch of RP). Tee and Baxter hired me as project manager for LEAN, which I did for a year and a few months, after which I product managed the first stages of the reboot of <a href=\"http://eahub.org\">eahub.org</a>. So basically... my opinions in this post are biased by my personal friendship with Kat, but not by any other aspects of my position.</p>\n<p>When I met Kat she was working on/leading Charity Science: Health. We struck up a friendship and, over my 2 and a half years of living in Vancouver, we socialised regularly. Mostly one to one, going on hikes together. But also in group contexts, such as dinner parties. Since I left Canada (in August 2019) we have kept in touch through video calls every few months.</p>\n<p>My assessment of Kat's character is that she is very moral and honest individual. I do not recognise any characterisation of her as manipulative or passive aggressive or threatening. Kat is direct. She is highly rational and principled. She is also a very creative, out of the box thinker who sees things through a completely unique lens which makes her very radical. She is extraordinarily committed and disciplined in adhering to her values and beliefs. I consider her to be a demonstrably objective and fair person. As the author mentioned, she is very positive and high energy. I have never met a more 'bubbly' person. Even during times when she has been going through really awful ordeals, she has always taken a more upbeat and optimistic outlook than others in her situation would have done. Like a lot of EAs, Kat feels deeply and is very impacted by her conscientious drive to do the right thing. I have seen her go through prolonged periods of turmoil and anxiety over a difficult decision where personal needs were in conflict with what she thought she ought to do. In my observation this has often led to extreme self-exploitation in terms of how hard she has worked, including when ill, because of her commitment to the cause she was working on and the people she was trying to help.</p>\n<p>I find that Kat is slow to criticise or judge others. There have often been times where I have needed to encourage Kat to put her own needs first, to recognise them and to take less shit from other people around her.</p>\n<p>Kat has, herself, endured living and working arrangements that I would see as inadvisable and unacceptable. This is important, because the stuff that Kat is being accused of inflicting on others is consistent with the choices and sacrifices that she imposes on herself.\nTo give you an example, Kat is one of the people who really earned my respect for living an ascetic life in order to give her time and money to charitable causes. For many years (I don't know about now) she and Joey gave themselves incredibly low salaries which I would definitely not have made do with. Dig up old posts by Kat on this forum and you will see advice and write-ups on how to live on next to nothing while staying happy, because that is how she lived. They both treated their own time similarly.</p>\n<p>When I was living in Vancouver, I lived in a shared house with some other EAs (including Tom Ash, Kieran Grieg, Mat Carpendale, Marylen Reid) who had been part of a shared working/living arrangement with Joey and Kat in the early days of Charity Science and of the Vancouver EA community. They described having taken over a set of apartments in a block of housing, and each thinking of a funny name for their apartments that symbolised something about them. The one Kat and Joey lived in was called 'the sweatshop' because of the insane hours they worked.</p>\n<p>I know some former employees of Charity Science who had some grievances and criticisms of how the charity was run. I remember a lot of these were around the org's slightly blase attitude towards legalities. As with what I said two paragraphs back, my observation was that Kat and Joey took all the risks for themselves and their own wellbeing that they asked of others. So I think you might question those risks or judgement calls, but I am sceptical that anything Kat has asked her employees to do wasn't something that lines up entirely with what she puts herself through.</p>\n<p>My overall interpretation of any 'weirdness' to do with issues such as casual contracts, terrible hours, unsafe working conditions, poor pay etc etc. is that I would not personally endorse nor work in that way. And I would personally be cautious towards an employer which had those views towards hours, pay, and legal irregularity.</p>\n<p>I do not see Kat as at all unusual in this attitude towards risk and compliance with conventions compared to other EAs. In my experience A LOT of people in the EA and rationalist space have similar views and attitudes to a whole range of things.</p>\n<p>In Vancouver, my sense of rationalists, and the EAs I lived with, is that people were quite keen to throw a lot of conventions and social norms in the dustbin as part of their interpretation of rationalism. This was pretty exasperating at times, but I do not put any of the individuals who I include in this generalisation into the category of 'bad actors' in my mind. Naive actors maybe... open minded to a fault? Socially blind? But each of them... people who are the first in line to live out the experiment that puts their rationalist beliefs to the test. I think that many people in this space have a poor grasp or appreciation of emotional and personal boundaries, but that this harms them as much as it harms others. A soft example of this in the shared house in Vancouver was when I walked into a room with a couple of my housemates and a large number of guests who were complete strangers. One of my housemates then turned to me and asked me on the spot to share the most embarrassing/irrational thing I had believed during my evangelical Christian childhood. While I understand the logic of why this kind of thing is a norm in rationalist communities, it was obviously hurtful and humiliating to me because a personally difficult time of my life was put under the spotlight in front of strangers, leading me to feel very unsafe. My housemate was doing something which they genuinely thought was promoting a good norm and a good culture, but in doing so they unintentionally hurt me. In my view many people in this thread are in that general category too, and it is somewhat of a spectrum.</p>\n<p>You may or may not be able to tell from how I frame this, that I'm a somewhat more conservative (small c) person myself. For example, I think polyamory is a terrible idea 99.9999999% of the time and that it would probably require several significant phases of actual species evolution for that to change. I think recreational drug use is needlessly risky. I could not get far enough away from the 'cuddle piles' my housemates were keen on. I'm very picky about my living arrangements and food, and my performance on the OCEAN test is basically sky high conscientiousness and neuroticism, paired with introversion and low agreeability. For openness I'm very high on openness to ideas but not to experiences. All of this is to say that lots of things about how many EAs and rationalists lived and did business (including Kat) would be most definitely 'weird' in my books, and 'oh hell no' in terms of how far I'd engage.</p>\n<p>I would also like to share that, despite the general views I've shared in this post, I actually did choose to work in an employment arrangement which was unorthodox when I was working for .impact under Tom Ash. When I initially worked for Tom on .impact, my pay was also very low. I was initially offered the LEAN project management job under some kind of set up where my accommodation and some food would be offered in Vancouver (living in the same house as Tom), to mitigate low pay. There was a contract (I'd never work without one), but there definitely were irregularities and short cuts that some might criticise. I am in no way mentioning this to shame or call out .impact, or Tom or any of it.</p>\n<p>The point I'm trying to make is that if you start to go over all EAs and EA orgs with a microscope, you'll find a lot of people have coloured outside the lines at some point in the last 15 years without anything going amiss. If I did not like my low pay, I didn't have to take the job! If I didn't want to live in a house with Tom, I didn't have to. In fact, when Tee offered me a job on LEAN months after I stopped working for Tom, my first question was whether he could coordinate something similar to what I had been offered by Tom.. namely accommodation in a foreign country I quite fancied trying out, with housemates and a social network thrown in, in exchange for a modest salary. If Time magazine was doing a feature on my job I'm sure this would all have sounded twisted and wrong. And when I moved into that EA house people WERE weird did do things differently... sometimes involving substances and physical intimacy. But that was completely fine, because I simply didn't go along with the things I didn't like (for the record I like none of those things and gave them a grossed out facial suggestion when they were brought to my attention. Hopefully they have now forgiven me). Had I found it weird living with Tom who had previously employed me (by the time I moved there he was on the board of Rethink Charity but no longer directly working with me) I would have moved out.</p>\n<p>Overall I think that unconventional working and living practices do come with high risks of misunderstandings. But they aren't enough in and of themselves to condemn people who run their lives and workplaces in this way, many of who do so because they sincerely think it is the best way to optimise the good. I also think that there is a level of responsibility on all sides in such an arrangement, which includes that of the employee to own their choices regarding what contracts they sign (or don't) and under what conditions they labour.</p>\n<p>I don't know the ins and outs of how Kat and Non Linear employed people. For the record, I have heard about either Alice or Chloe once from Kat before, very briefly, aside from today.</p>\n<p>Nevertheless, a lot of things are completely off to me about this whole thread.</p>\n<p>I disagree with the suggestion that there was something sinister about a policy of 'we don't talk badly about you and you don't talk badly about us'. That is a rephrasing of a fairly standard social (and literal) contract which exists between the majority of people all around the world. As somebody who works for the government making policy, you bet I'd lose my job outright if I publicly criticised them. But I would also expect a variation of this from most employers.</p>\n<p>On a personal and ethical level, I think it is completely unacceptable to slander or badmouth any person or organisation without first giving them a chance to resolve things and settle things privately. I have been on the receiving end, many times, of hurtful public confrontations from people who I thought I was on good terms with. In each case the first time I had any inkling at all something was amiss was when I was challenged in a public setting and completely blindsided. Those experiences were devastating and entirely unfair (none of them happened in EA... one of them was on a fan online community, and the others were at school and in my faculty while I was on my PhD. I feel pain and sorrow from these events to this day, and they have significantly affected my trust and sense of security in social environments.</p>\n<p>Kat says that each of these things were true about how she learned about the grievances of 'Chloe' and 'Alice'. As I understand it, she also had no idea this post was coming from Ben before it was made, and was not given a fair chance to provide evidence to refute a lot of the accusations made. And even when she is able to disprove them, the shape of the accusation is now out there and will have consequences and live on in peoples' perceptions and memories.</p>\n<p>To me, aside from how unfair and cruel I think this was to Kat, I am also very uneasy about the way the EA community seems to be approaching a lot of adjacent issues.</p>\n<p>It seems to me that (gradually but most obviously) since FTX there was this switch to thinking that its somehow healthy or appropriate to launch a kind of autophagic self-immolation process whereby bits of the community launch toxic witchhunts against other bits. It's not healthy. It's not constructive. It's not effective, and to add insult to injury - it's not necessary.</p>\n<p>I am completely for improving the practices, standards, conventions etc. in the EA community, but I am deeply disappointed that people think that a constructive way to do this is via call out culture. I had rather hoped that the one place on the internet I could trust people not to engage in pillory and vigilantism would be in EA! I use those words completely literally, not to be inflammatory. That is what I think this approach amounts to in practice.</p>\n<p>All people, regardless of their position of power, privilege or status, deserve to be treated and considered innocent until proven guilty by some mechanism that is most certainly not Concerned Neighbour #5 or the equivalent. Of course we need a mechanism for people to challenge abuses of power or severe malpractice, but public speculation about specific people or organisations doesn't constitute a professional, fair or reliable vehicle for delivering that outcome.</p>\n<p>This is aside from the fact that Kat and Non Linear are not all-powerful in this set up. Chloe, Alice and friends have intentionally or otherwise caused huge devastation to their reputation and wellbeing. And when I opened this thread, it jumped out as unfair that the two accusors were anonymised while Kat and Non Linear were not. I believe it is out of order for Kat's personal and professional reputation to be publicly attacked this way. This is not just because I believe that Kat is being mischaracterised. It is also a point of principle regardless of the particulars.</p>\n<p>I also don't want to see any other orgs or EAs subject to this either,  in the future.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"Going forward I think anyone who works with Kat Woods, Emerson Spartz, or Drew Spartz, should sign legal employment contracts, and make sure all financial agreements are written down in emails and messages that the employee has possession of. I think all people considering employment by the above people at any non-profits they run should take salaries where money is wired to their bank accounts, and not do unpaid work or work that is compensated by ways that don\u2019t primarily include a salary being wired to their bank accounts.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>To be fair, this should be a fairly universal assumption for any individual considering any employment arrangement. I don't think it is for me or for you or me to form opinions about what went down between Non Linear and it's employees, but if Non Linear employees didn't see to the above then I do think they exercised poor judgement.</p>\n<p>I'll conclude by referring back to my paragraph where I reflected on common kinds of weirdness among EAs and rationalists. I do completely trust that Kat was honest, honourable and conscientious in all of her dealings with her employees. However, I see it as quite likely that she and multitudes of others in this community have approached things in an unorthodox way which we might describe as 'unwise'. But 'unwise' is a very far cry from the portrait painted in this thread, and the consequences of the maverick practices of many EAs and rationalists backfire on them just as they do on others. Conventions, regulations, codes of practice, norms... these are safety rails which  live on because they produce good outcomes on average. I think many EAs and rationalists could learn from well honed systems in other industries and institutions. That's something this debacle really highlights. However, the same point applies to dealing with disagreements and accusations in a professional, fair and systemetised manner.</p>\n<p>As I've been drafting this post for 4 hours and counting, this concludes my engagement with Internet drama for 2023.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Richenda"}}, {"_id": "jCxg6nNHBL76qbsTE", "postedAt": "2023-09-07T23:41:00.753Z", "postId": "32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH", "htmlBody": "<p>Yeah, though if I learned \"Alice is just not the sort of person to loudly advocate for herself\" it wouldn't update me much about Nonlinear at this point, because (a) I already have a fair amount of probability on that based on the publicly shared information, and (b) my main concerns are about stuff like \"is Nonlinear super cutthroat and manipulative?\" and \"does Nonlinear try to scare people into not criticizing Nonlinear?\".</p><p>Those concerns are less directly connected to the vegan-food thing, and might be tricky to empirically distinguish from the hypothesis \"Alice and/or Chloe aren't generally the sort of people to be loud about their preferences\" if we focus on the food situation.</p><p>(Though I cared about the vegan-food thing in its own right too, and am glad Kat shared more details.)</p>", "parentCommentId": "GqLy3vkvHcg8JJpKE", "user": {"username": "RobBensinger"}}, {"_id": "4DC533jB9WkNrEKyP", "postedAt": "2023-09-07T23:45:47.487Z", "postId": "32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH", "htmlBody": "<p>I find the idea of doing that absolutely awful and I've never done anything like that.

There are a zillion shitty jobs out there, and there is nothing wrong with either advertizing or taking a shitty job so long as everyone is aware it is shitty and the terms are clear upfront.</strong></p><p>Against Non-Linear: It is not clear that the interns/whatever were fully aware just how shitty the jobs would be upfront, and they were probably oversold on them. This was probably seen as good business strategy. It isn't.</p><p>Against Alice: Personally, I think these jobs would have red flags a mile away. I have known people who went to work for obvious MLMs, and I think it is ultimately the responsibility of the person signing the contract to read the fine print and be aware of what they are getting into. If you, as an organization, put out shitty terms, and someone agrees to that, it's not your fault for making a shitty offer. If you, as an employee, accept work without a clear contract.... Don't do that. Other people may try to exploit you, and the typical company WILL try to exploit you. That is what they do. Your only defense is to not accept it. If you accept that, you agreed to it so you have to live with the consequences.</p><p>Again, probably the shittiness of the job was somewhat covered up. To the extent to which that is the case, beyond ordinary marketing, that's on Non-Linear. Personally, I think these jobs would be incredibly obviously shitty. And merely advertizing or filling a shitty job is not a crime.</p><p><strong>2. Every organization eventually has someone who distorts the truth and could be a future disgruntled employee.</strong></p><p>This point is not against Non-Linear or against Alice.</p><p>Rather, we should be careful of the low bar Ben set for publicizing this.</p><p>I agree that this would be more of a scandal if Non-Linear were bigger, and it's great to catch this before then, for many reasons.</p><p>But if you hire enough people, you will eventually run into someone who distorts the truth. We may all have different base rates for this. On the one hand, it could be seen as costly to complain. On the other hand, work generally kind of sucks - that's why you have to be paid to do it. (If your work doesn't suck, consider yourself very lucky.) So people often end up in tension with their employers.</p><p>So whatever epistemic standards we set need to account for the fact that, given enough time, there <strong>will</strong> be a motivated disgruntled employee in every EA organization. The trick is how you can distinguish between the organizations that are generally rotten and the ones with a disgruntled employee or two. And I'm not sure Ben's post really gets at this. The talk about setting a low bar is concerning because I don't need an alarm that goes off whenever there is a story, because that will be every organization given enough time. I need an alarm that can distinguish between the signal and the noise. I care about the false negatives <strong>and</strong> the false positives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Personally, I don't find myself updating on the information in Ben's post, and I had not previously heard of any issues with Non-Linear. I don't find myself updating simply because the set-up was so obviously shitty that I'm not surprised. The founders are so clearly obsessed with themselves and brag about how little they pay people for outsourced work - how <i>could</i> it be a good place to work, even before getting to the shared living situation?</p><p>Shitty jobs are shitty. Water is wet. I don't blame Non-Linear for advertizing shitty jobs (so long as they weren't misleading about it). I think it's a shame that young people sometimes have poor awareness regarding shitty jobs, but I don't blame Alice for not realizing. I find it hard to blame either party here for acting in their own self-interest, but practically speaking Non-Linear should have advertized the jobs more to people for whom it would be a legitimate step up, rather than people who would only work there if they were confused about its shittiness.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Moe"}}, {"_id": "d59m7iBxYdHfXWibn", "postedAt": "2023-09-08T01:17:37.768Z", "postId": "32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>If someone uses the phrase \"saving the world\" on any level approaching consistent, run.

Hell, I\u2019d be convinced.</li></ol><blockquote><p>&nbsp;I don\u2019t say bad things about you, you don\u2019t say bad things about me.</p></blockquote><p>I agree this can <i>sound</i> suspicious, but I\u2019ve always had the same principle. I refrain from creating negative impressions of others, because I think everyone should have a chance to make 1 good first impression. I also think it\u2019s subjectively easier to echo negative rumours than positive rumours. All this can add up to a very warped perception, if most of what you hear about a person is secondhand.<br>Of course, this doesn\u2019t extend to possible harm/abuse, so don\u2019t take any of this as me minimising/refuting Alice or Chloe\u2019s experiences. And, as mentioned, I don\u2019t like assuming ill<br>of others based <i>purely</i> on secondhand information.</p><blockquote><p>Alice and Chloe report that they were advised not to spend time with \u2018low value people\u2019, including their families, romantic partners, and anyone local to where they were staying, with the exception of guests/visitors that Nonlinear invited. Alice and Chloe report this made them very socially dependent on Kat/Emerson/Drew and otherwise very isolated.</p></blockquote><p>This is the one part I\u2019m outright skeptical of. It sounds very out-of-character, to the point where I can\u2019t foresee the Nonlinear team ever saying this. My experience with Kat, Drew or Emerson is that they love their families/partners a lot, and frequently communicate/visit. They are extremely intentional, scheduling in time to talk to loved ones every day. And if you think about it \u2026 why would someone visit a dozen countries a year, plus all the bureaucracy and hassle involved, if they <i>didn\u2019t</i> like interacting with locals.<br>This daily pattern of behaviour would be really odd/suboptimal from a cold, logical, utility-maximising standpoint, as implied here.</p><blockquote><p>Multiple people who worked with Kat reported that Kat had a pattern of enforcing arbitrary short deadlines on people in order to get them to make the decision she wants e.g. \u201cI need a decision by the end of this call\u201d, or (in an email to Alice) \u201cThis is urgent and important. There are people working on saving the world and we can\u2019t let our issues hold them back from doing their work.\u201d&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>My Occam\u2019s Razor read is that Kat is basically externalising her internal dialogue. Kat naturally tends to procrastinate, so she uses these strategies to get herself to do work, and that self pep-talk sounds really weird when she externalises it to others. I struggle with procrastination as someone with ADHD, so my internal dialogue sounds very similar, I just don\u2019t use that phrasing when talking to others haha.</p><blockquote><p>By the same reasoning, the employees reported that they were given 100% of the menial tasks around the house (cleaning, tidying, etc) due to their lower value of time to the company. For instance, if a cofounder spilled food in the kitchen, the employees would clean it up. This was generally reported as feeling very demeaning.</p></blockquote><p>If it means anything, when I stayed with Kat and Emerson for around 2 weeks, I never experienced anything similar. Driving, dishwashing and laundry I was never asked to do, which somehow felt weird the other way, because I thought I was doing too little.</p><blockquote><p>Other times when Alice would come to Kat with money troubles and asking for a pay rise, Alice reports that Kat would tell them that this was a psychological issue and that actually they had safety, for instance they could move back in with their parents, so they didn\u2019t need to worry.</p></blockquote><p>OK, I feel this is a misinterpretation. Kat said this to me, but I had a different interpretation. Basically, I was discussing my idea of \u201c<a href=\"https://twitter.com/sama/status/1517223722905571329?lang=en\">the deferred life plan\u201d:</a> that, in my experience, ambitious people who want to start/build/work on meaningful things have a tendency to rationalise not doing it by simply not thinking too hard about the details.&nbsp;<br><br><i>[DISCLAIMER: Taken at face value, Kat\u2019s response to Alice is an insensitive response to a subordinate saying they have money problems and need a pay rise. I\u2019m suggesting that there might have been more context, based on Kat saying very similar things in a very different tone to me.]</i><br><br>I\u2019m sure a lot of EAs have heard/believed some variation of <i>\u201cinstead of trying to help the world/pursue meaningful things, you need to first go to a good college, get a good degree, build a good resume/CV, climb the corporate ladder, achieve financial independence and retire with a 3% rate of withdrawal and then do the thing you want\u201d.</i> My background is climate activism in Singapore, so that\u2019s basically the only advice I\u2019d ever heard.</p><p>I asked Kat for her opinion, because I knew she basically didn\u2019t do any of that. She didn\u2019t have a college degree, travelled a lot and spent years starting a nonprofit and living on very little. This topic is worth its own very long post, but essentially, she said <i>\u201cyou need to break down and plan out exactly what your financial needs are, because intentionally maximising your runway gives you more room for risk tolerance\u201d.</i></p><p>I think that makes sense. I think young EAs, and honestly, most young people, don\u2019t confront themselves on what tradeoffs they need to have the life they want, purely out of discomfort. I\u2019m a guy surrounded by guys from prestigious colleges, I feel all my peers just procrastinate pursuing things that matter to them by seeking high-status, high paying jobs. A lot of them have no goal of <i>\u201cif I make 75k a year for 3 years and rent with 3 roommates, I can pursue what I want for a decade at 25 years old\u201d,</i> even though that\u2019s exactly the kind of calculation you need to \u2026 pursue meaningful things. And if you remove rent from the equation by living with parents, your risk tolerance goes way up.</p><p>Anyway, that\u2019s my interpretation, based on hearing the exact same words from Kat, but extracting a very different meaning.</p><blockquote><p>Re: Adversarial business practices</p></blockquote><p>As for Emerson, he gives very transparent advice about how sharks operate, and how to survive them. He\u2019s very perceptive (or at least, sounds perceptive) about adversarial strategies in high-growth, highly competitive spaces like online media and Web3, due to his 2 decades of experience in these fields.</p><p>Do I think Emerson can sound like a bad actor? Absolutely. It\u2019s hard for a person to explain common manipulative strategies with sounding <i>incredibly suspicious.</i> However, for me, I spent the entire 2 weeks with him writing down notes on my laptop, notes I\u2019ve found incredibly helpful as I\u2019ve been scaling a generative AI startup for the past 4-5 months. Personally, I had to learn to deal with bad actors and adversarial business practices, either by being taught beforehand, or by experiencing it myself, and I vastly,vastly prefer being taught.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Minh Nguyen"}}, {"_id": "TBjJXSTE2jZWwhwQj", "postedAt": "2023-09-08T06:37:38.568Z", "postId": "32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH", "htmlBody": "<p>I'm just going to share my implicit model of this situation, which is that Lightcone is preoccupied with a particular kind of perceived integrity violation that Kat and Emerson are more okay with.

But if I <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/NewToReddit/comments/qbb173/comment/hhhsn0v/\">point to a website that's more experienced in brigading</a> being used to distort discussion, reddit, they consider leaving comments to be brigading:&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>A term that originated on Reddit, <a href=\"https://institute.global/policy/social-media-futures-what-brigading\">Brigading</a> is when a group of users, generally outsiders to the targeted subreddit, \"invade\" a specific subreddit and flood it with downvotes in order to damage karma dynamics on the targeted sub<strong>; spam the sub with posts and comments to further their own agenda</strong>; or perform other coordinated abusive behaviour such as insulting or harassing the subreddit\u2019s users in order to troll, manipulate, or interfere with the targeted community.</p></blockquote><p>(Bold is mine) I suspect most with reddit mod or admin experience would consider what happened to be brigading, because: A) You're over-representing a certain opinion. One might want to use the ratio of comments to quickly determine who is right/wrong, comment brigading distorts this metric. B) You're increasing the flow of <i>team A people, </i>on a<i> team B </i>post, leading to distorted voting, distorted replies (and as discussed, distorted comments)&nbsp;</p><p>You discuss whether it's acceptable for different actors to engage in coordinated comment posting. I'd argue, and wager that the EA forum team agrees, that it's pretty much always unacceptable to engage in concealed coordinated forum engagement.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><br>Would anyone accuse me of brigading if I theoretically knew other people who had negative experiences with Nonlinear and asked them to chime in?</p></blockquote><p>Yes. Please disclose if you ever do anything like this. It's absolutely brigading.&nbsp;<br><br>(2) I have a few key areas of disagreement with this angle&nbsp;<br><br>A) the positive comments being left, are largely irrelevant. If the claim is \"Kat encouraged me to drive without a license\" then no amount of \"I have had great experiences with Kat at EAGs\" is relevant.&nbsp;<br><br>B) Early on, these comments had the potential to set the trajectory of discussion. If you have a model of the forum, where everybody shares perspectives unbiasedly and confidently, then you might be surprised to hear this. But most users try to \"read the room\" before commenting, and will be less likely to comment if they're saying something controversial.&nbsp;<br><br>C) Most users try to determine what's true and what's false by reading the overall total valance of comments. I agree, this is not a great way for determining what is and is not true, but it's a reality. Manipulating the ratio of valanced comments is unhelpful for this reason.&nbsp;<br><br>Just to finish on a question, if Kat had asked N number of people to chime in, at what point would you think it's excessive? I.e. I assume we'd agree, if she asked 400 people to chime in, that would be excessive. But what is the minimum number whereby you feel this would be excessive?&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "eKN7BBbcxPAe5FcQa", "user": {"username": "ElliotJDavies"}}, {"_id": "tvpvoYwvbbsPCdArH", "postedAt": "2023-09-08T10:03:38.066Z", "postId": "32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>A) the positive comments being left, are largely irrelevant.

(Bolding added)</p><p>If you follow&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH/sharing-information-about-nonlinear?commentId=Ejbe8ukX6FhrfRv5C\"><u>the link</u></a>, you\u2019ll see we have screenshots demonstrating that:</p><p>1. There was vegan food in the house, which we offered her.&nbsp;</p><p>2. I personally went out, while I was sick myself, to buy vegan food for her (mashed potatoes) and cooked it for her and brought it to her.</p><p>I have empathy for Alice. She was hungry (because of her fighting with a boyfriend [not Drew] in the morning and having a light breakfast) and sick. That sucks, and I feel for her. And that\u2019s why I tried (and succeeded) in getting her food.&nbsp;</p><p>I would be fine if she told people that she was hungry when she was sick, and she felt sad and stressed. Or that she was hungry but wasn\u2019t interested in any of the food we had in the house. But she told everybody that we didn\u2019t get her food when we did. This made us look like uncaring people, which we are not. She even said in her texts that she felt loved and supported.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>We chose this example not because it\u2019s the most damning (although it certainly paints us in very negative and misleading light) but simply because it was the easiest claim to explain where we had extremely clear evidence without having to add a lot of context, explanation, find more evidence, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>Even so, it took us hours to put together and share. Both because we had to track down all of the old conversations, make sure we weren\u2019t getting anything wrong, anonymize Alice, format the screenshots (they kept getting blurry), and importantly, write it up. Writing for the EA Forum/LessWrong is already quite a difficult thing, with it being a reasonable assumption that people will point out any little detail you get wrong. I ask to please empathize with how it must be for us now, given that so many people currently see everything we post through the lens of being unethical people.</p><p>If you\u2019ve ever spent a long time trying to get a post just right for the EA Forum/LessWrong, I ask you to empathize with what we\u2019re going through here.</p><p>We also had to spend time dealing with all of the other comments while trying to pull this together. My inbox is completely swamped. Not to mention trying to hold myself together when the worst thing that\u2019s ever happened to me is happening.</p><p>We simply meant that original comment to be a placeholder while we spent time gathering and sharing the evidence. We simply wanted people to withhold judgment.&nbsp;</p><p>We continue to ask this. We are all working full-time on gathering, organizing, and explaining all of the evidence. We expect to put out multiple posts over the next few weeks showing more evidence like the above.&nbsp;</p><p>We think that if you see the evidence, a sizeable percentage of you will update and think that we are not \u201cpredators\u201d to be avoided, but rather good but far from perfect people trying to do good. We made some mistakes, and we learned from them and set up ways to prevent them. There are also misrepresentations of the truth that are happening that we will provide evidence for.

It\u2019s a lot easier (and vastly less time consuming) to provide those examples in a private one-on-one with Ben than to provide them publicly (where, for instance, issues of confidentially become much more complicated, and where documentation and wording need to be handled with extreme care, quite different than the norms of conversation).</p>\n<p>The easiest to explain example is that Ben claimed a bunch of very bad sounding quotes from Glassdoor were about Emerson that clearly weren\u2019t (he hadn\u2019t been at the company for years when those complaints were written).

I care a lot about our community having some kind of good process of aggregating information, allowing individuals to integrate it, and update, and decide what to do with it.</p><p>I think a lot of disagreements in the comments here and on LW stem from people having an implicit assumption that the conversation here is about \"should [any particular person in this article] be socially punished?\". In my preferred world, before you get to that phase there should be at least some period focused on \"information aggregation and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SA79JMXKWke32A3hG/original-seeing\">Original Seeing.</a>\"</p><p>It's pretty tricky, since in the default, world, \"social punishment?\" is indeed the conversation people jump to. And in practice, it's hard to have words <i>just</i> focused on epistemic-evaluation without getting into judgment, or without speech acts being \"moves\" in a social conflict.&nbsp;</p><p>But, I think it's useful to at least (individually) inhabit the frame of \"what is true, here?\" without asking questions like \"what do those truths imply?\".</p><p>With that in mind, some generally useful epistemic advice that I think is relevant here:</p><p><strong>Try to have Multiple Hypotheses</strong></p><p>It's useful to have at least two, and preferably three, hypotheses for what's going on in cases like this. (Or, generally whenever you're faced with a confusing situation where you're not sure what's true). If you only have one hypothesis, you may be tempted to shoehorn evidence into being evidence for/against that hypothesis, and you may be anchored on it.</p><p>If you have at least two hypotheses (and, like, \"real ones\", that both seem plausible to you), I find it easier to take in new bits of data, and then ask \"okay, how would this fit into <i>two different </i>plausible scenarios\"? which activates my \"actually check\" process.</p><p>I think three hypotheses is better than two because two can still end up in a \"all the evidence ways in on a one-dimensional spectrum\". Three hypotheses a) helps you do 'triangulation', and b) helps remind you to actually do the \"what frame <i>should</i> I be having here? what are <i>other additional</i> hypotheses that I might not have thought of yet?\"</p><p><strong>Multiple things can be going on at once</strong></p><p>If two people have a conflict, it could be the case that one person is at-fault, or both people are at-fault, or neither (i.e. it was a miscommunication or something).&nbsp;</p><p>If one person does an action, it could be true, simultaneously, that:</p><ul><li>They are somewhat motivated by [Virtuous Motive A]</li><li>They are somewhat motivated by [Suspicious Motive B]</li><li>They are motivated by [Random Innocuous Motive C]</li></ul><p>I once was arguing with someone, and they said \"your body posture tells me you aren't even trying to listen to me or reason correctly, you're just trying to do a status monkey smackdown and put me in my place.\" And, I was like \"what? No, I have good introspective access and I just checked whether I'm trying to make a reasoned argument. I can tell the difference between doing The Social Monkey thing and the \"actually figure out the truth\" thing.\"</p><p>What I later realized is that I was, like, 65% motivated by \"actually wanna figure out the truth\", and like 25% motivated by \"socially punish this person\" (which was a slightly different flavor of \"socially punish\" then, say, when I'm having a really tribally motivated facebook fight, so I didn't recognize it as easily).</p><p><strong>Original Seeing vs Hypothesis Evaluation vs Judgment</strong></p><p>OODA Loops include four steps: Observe, Orient, Decide, Act</p><p>Often people skip over steps. They think they've already observed enough and don't bother looking for new observations. Or it doesn't even occur to them to do that explicitly. (I've noticed that I often skip to the <i>orient</i> step, where I figure out about \"how do I organize my information? what sort of decision am I about to decide on?\", and not actually do the <i>observe</i> step, where I'm purely focused on gaining raw data.</p><p>When you've already decided on a schema-for-thinking-about-a-problem, you're more likely to take new info that comes in and put it in a bucket you think you already understand.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/SA79JMXKWke32A3hG/original-seeing\">Original Seeing</a> is different from \"organizing information\".</p><p>They are both different from \"evaluating which hypothesis is true\"</p><p>They are both different from \"deciding what to do, given Hypothesis A is true\"</p><p>Which is in turn different from \"actually taking actions, given that you've decided what to do.\"</p><p>I have a sort of idealistic dream that someday, a healthy rationalist/EA community could collectively be capable of raising hypotheses, without people anchoring on them, and people share information in a way you robustly trust won't get automatically leveraged into a conflict/political move. I don't think we're close enough to that world to advocate for it in-the-moment, but I do think it's still good practice for people <i>individually</i> to be spending at least some of their time in node the OODA loop, and tracking which node they're currently focusing on.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Raemon"}}, {"_id": "ogqbrei4L24sSBKBm", "postedAt": "2023-09-08T17:00:41.166Z", "postId": "32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH", "htmlBody": "<p>Yep, not clear what to do about that.

But: I hope Nonlinear will rise to the occasion, and take the first stab at writing some soul-searching/error-analysis synthesis post that explains: \"We initially tried THIS system/attitude to handle employees, in the era the complaints are from. We made the following (wrong in retrospect) assumptions. That worked out poorly. Now we try this other thing, and after trialing several things, X seems to go fine (see # other mentee/employee impressions). On further thought, we intend to make Y additional adjustment going forward. Also, we commit to avoiding situations where Z in the future. We admit that A looks sketchy to some, but we wish to signal that we intend to continue doing it, and defend that using logic B...\"</p>\n<p>I think giving Nonlinear the chance to show that they have thought through how to fix these issues/avoid generating them in the future, would be good. They are in what (should) be the best position to know what has happened or set up an investigation, and are probably the most invested in making sense of it (Emotions and motivated cognition come with that, so it's a mixed bag, sure. I hope public scrutiny keeps them honest.). They are also probably the <em>only</em> ones who have the ability to enforce or monitor a within-org change in policy, and/or to undergo some personal-growth.</p>\n<p>If Nonlinear is the one who creates it, this could be an opportunity to read a bit into how they are thinking about it, and for others to reevaluate how much they expect past behavior and mistakes to continue to accurately predict their future behavior, and judge how likely these people are to fix the genre of problems brought up here.</p>\n<p>(If they do a <em>bad</em> job at this, or even just if they seem to have \"missed a spot\": I do hope people will chime in at that point, with a bunch of more detailed and thoughtful models/commentary on how to run a weird experimental small EA org without this kind of problem emerging, in the comments. I think burnout is common, but experiences <em>this</em> bad are rare, especially as a pattern.)</p>\n<p>((If Nonlinear fails to do this at all: Maybe it does fall to other people to... \"digest some take-aways for them, on behalf of the audience, as a hypothetical exercise?\" IDK.

I agree with much of what you say but I seemingly have a few important differences of opinion:</p><blockquote><p><br>\"I disagree with holding all misconduct reports to incredibly high standards, such that in a report with as many allegations as this, people feel the report is basically wrong if it includes a few misinterpretations. In an ideal world, yes, all summaries of patterns of misconduct would not contain any errors. But in reality, I've found that almost all allegations of behaviors that turn out to be -- for all intents and purposes -- true, contain some level of mistakes, misattributions, specific allegations that are overstated.\"</p></blockquote><p>I agree. I don't think I was holding the report to an incredibly high standard though. When I read it I was immediately chagrined by the amount and severity of false information (i.e., false as far as I can tell based on the evidence I have access to). I was also distressed that Ben was not seeking out evidence he could have easily gotten from nonlinear.</p><blockquote><p><br>\"People who allege misconduct are under intense scrutiny. And absolutely, scrutiny is warranted. But as someone who has reported misconduct and spoken to other people that report misconduct, the expectation of perfection is, to put it mildly, chilling. It means people do not come forward, it means people who do come forward are further traumatized, it means allegations that are 80% truthful are dismissed outright.\"</p></blockquote><p>Good point. I would differentiate between the standard for people privately reporting bad behavior (where I think the bar should be way lower) and large scale investigations that are made public (where I think the bar should be much higher for the claims made - e.g., that the investigator should be very careful not to credulously include damaging false information).</p><blockquote><p><br>\"Does a third or more of what Ben wrote comport with your general understanding? If so, these allegations are still concerning to me.\"</p></blockquote><p>I think this framing doesn't quite work because the post contains some very minor concerns and some very major ones, and I think it's much more important whether the major concerns are accurate than that the minor concerns are accurate, so counting up the number of inaccuracies doesn't, I think, reflect what's important. But based on the evidence I've seen, some of the damning claims in his original post seemed to me to be false or missing critical context that make them very misleading.</p><blockquote><p><br>\"And on the Kat screenshots/food question, I do not think they delegitimize what Ben wrote here. At worst, Ben somewhat overstated the food situation. But, my overall impression from those screenshots was what Alice said was basically true. Kat's framing of what the screenshots say make me doubt Kat's account more, not less.\"</p></blockquote><p><br>I think people should decide for themselves what they think is true about this after reviewing the evidence. Here is a side-by-side comparison of what Ben says and what Kat says:</p><p><strong>Ben</strong>: \"Alice claims she was sick with covid in a foreign country, with only the three Nonlinear cofounders around, but nobody in the house was willing to go out and get her vegan food, so she barely ate for 2 days.\"</p><p><strong>Kat</strong>: \"1.

That is a rephrasing of a fairly standard social (and literal) contract which exists between the majority of people all around the world. As somebody who works for the government making policy, you bet I'd lose my job outright if I publicly criticised them. But I would also expect a variation of this from most employers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think it's reasonable for an employer to no longer want to hire you or work with you if you're saying bad things about them, but I don't think it's appropriate for them to try to limit what you say beyond that. I think it's not appropriate for your employer to try to hurt you or your future career prospects at other employers because you talked about having a bad time with them.</p>\n<p>Whistleblower protections aren't exactly analogous, because AIUI they're about disclosure to government authorities, rather than to the general public, and that's a significant enough difference that it makes sense to treat them separately. But it's nevertheless interesting to note that if you disclose certain kinds of wrongdoing in certain ways, your employer isn't even allowed to fire you, let alone retaliate beyond that. These rules are important: it's difficult and unpleasant to be in that situation, but if that's where you end up, protecting the employee over the employer is IMO the right call.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[...] autophagic self-immolation process [...] toxic witchhunts [...] pillory and vigilantism</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I get that threats like these are very painful for the people involved.

I agree social norms are important.</p>\n<p>A possible problem with this kind of conformity principle is that it can preclude moral progress.  Suppose you think a popular law is unjust, and the best way to demonstrate that is to break it publicly.  It could be that all the groups you name take the view that an unjust law is good.  If <em>everyone</em> followed conformity principles, I think we would have a lot more old unjust laws on the books.  (You could try using the third clause about \"laws other EAs think is OK to break\" as an out here, but there's a problem -- EAs in this very thread are endorsing conformity and advocating against weirdness!  Maybe the EA movement was once a bastion of principled independent moral reasoning, but I get the sense that aspect of the movement is weakening.)</p>\n<p>In general I don't think apparent consensus views regarding which laws are OK to break are the output of a high-quality decision process.  In fact, I think most people are quite conformist, and what looks like \"consensus\" is mostly a result of behavioral drift.  E.g. if we polled people on the ethics of online music piracy, my guess is that pre-internet, lots of people would say it's wrong (virtue is cheap).  The introduction of Limewire et al. would cause people to rationalize fun and decide it's OK.  The introduction of Spotify et al. would cause an increase in people saying \"if I'm paying then so should you, it's easy\".  I would guess that people who do principled moral reasoning regarding the ethics of music piracy are a minority who aren't driving changes in consensus opinion.  [Edit: Nonetheless, individual moral reasoning isn't necessarily more reliable than consensus, especially given that individuals may be subject to self-serving motives that are nearly impossible to be aware of and take into account.]</p>\n<p>I also think people in this thread underrate the importance of a specific individual's context.  For example, suppose I am broke, homeless, and suffering from suicidal depression.  I happen to hear a song I really like, and I use Shazam to identify it.  I don't have the money to buy the song, and I think downloading it could help with my suicidal depression.  Is there a sense in which pirating the song is more OK for me than it is for Bill Gates?  I would say yes.  (Perhaps one could even use the \"context\" angle to argue that the introduction of Spotify does, in fact, change the ethics of music piracy!)</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "cPkgxS95xJY28TfFh", "user": {"username": "chinscratch"}}, {"_id": "8ukrdjTXLyysbGb2n", "postedAt": "2023-09-09T19:50:10.409Z", "postId": "32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH", "htmlBody": "<p>Can you give a probability (conditional upon the world existing, humans being alive, etc) for the following statement</p><blockquote><p>In the year 2300, the majority of ethical philosophers would consider the claim \"it is an ethically permissible and perhaps even obligatory act of civil disobedience for employers to pressure their employees to drive cars without a driver's license, in situations similar to that faced by people living in the United States in 2021.\" to be correct and perhaps even self-evident.</p></blockquote><p>(if you don't like the operationalization of ethical philosophers as a stand-in for moral progress, I'm happy for you to come up with a better one).</p><p>___</p><p>Taken a step back, I do want to preserve the \"philosophy club\" aspect of EA<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcn9crsj6mg\"><sup><a href=\"#fncn9crsj6mg\">[1]</a></sup></span>. I think certain EA (ethics) discussions, in their na\u00efvet\u00e9, willingness to think outside the box, follow arguments to their logical conclusions, high decoupling, are at its best quite valuable and insightful in discovering moral innovations and alternative empirical worldviews.&nbsp;<br><br>And often you need to think pretty radical ideas before coming up with fairly sensible solutions. For example, without Brian Tomasik's early work on Wild Animal Suffering, we would not have sensible interventions on humane pesticides and shrimp welfare.

Namely \"public use of reason\" is what you advocate for or ideas you explore in the public arena. Whereas \"private use of reason\" is what you actually do in your own life (including both personally and professionally, but especially professionally). &nbsp;It's a bit confusing because most people have very different intuitions for the relevant bits of public v private axes. But I think the core conclusion in my lights is that you can get most of the benefits<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftz3qanotvqk\"><sup><a href=\"#fntz3qanotvqk\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;of ethical innovation at the discourse stage without having to bite the bullet that you also need companies, governments, etc, to be run by \"ethical innovators.\"</p><p>So in the alleged Nonlinear example, it is one thing for Emerson or Kat, in their public commentator capacities as (eg) EA Forum commentators or op-ed writers, to (eg) advance a position that driving license laws are immoral and classist and we should get rid of them, while being careful that they are not speaking for any organization or in a professional capacity, etc. It is quite another, in their capacities as nonprofit managers, to mandate that an employee or semi-employee to illegally drive a car without a license.&nbsp;</p><p>Now in the demarcation above, it will seem like I should be happy (morally and epistemically if not intellectually) with \"novel\" ethical positions advanced on the forum, as the EA forum is a discussion venue rather than an action venue. However, when people discuss bizarre edge cases about breaking the law without (eg) a careful public/private demarcation, in the context of a discussion where long-time forum members have been alleged to break laws in a situation that's clearly not one of the bizarre edge cases, I worry that both the commentators and onlookers don't in fact have a clean separation in their heads of what's okay to say vs. do, including, unfortunately, people with quite a bit of power in absolute terms.&nbsp;<br><br>(Also I'm limited on free time and I can't tell if you're trolling etc, so I'm probably not going to comment further on this thread, sorry).&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fncn9crsj6mg\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefcn9crsj6mg\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Actual philosophers, in comparison, feel relatively more sterile and uncreative at least in my discussions with them.

Ben's account of Nonlinear's behavior is troubling, and I hope the leadership takes a hard look in the mirror, but it's important for us as a movement to learn the right lessons.</p>\n<p>Thanks for bringing up the public vs private use of reason thing.  A lot of my thinking on these questions was shaped by reading a book about the US in the antebellum + Civil War period.  As I remember, in signing the Emancipation Proclamation, Abraham Lincoln was acting as an ethical innovator.  (Advisors suggested he wait until right after a major Union victory to sign the proclamation, in order to better sell the North on the concept.)  It does seem to me that recommending \"Abraham Lincoln shouldn't have signed the Emancipation Proclamation\" is a pretty serious hit for an ethical rule to take.</p>\n<p>(Note that an abolitionist soldier who fought well for the Union in the Civil War would be violating the deontological principle \"don't kill people\" in order to produce a tiny shift in the probability of a hypothetical future benefit.  And sure enough, in that soldier's far future, we look back on that soldier as a hero.  Furthermore, an analogous \"year 2023\" statement would appear to miss the point -- many 2023 people think that killing is generally wrong, and also that the abolitionist soldier's actions are justified in context.)</p>\n<p>Another case where the \"leaders shouldn't be moral innovators\" principle fails by my lights: is it ethical to <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/35bfnGmsyrZkEnkLJ/steering-ai-to-care-for-animals-and-soon\">persuade people in AI care about animals</a> to a greater degree than people in the general population care about animals?  I would say yes.</p>\n<p>Another point re: leaders who innovate morally -- as e.g. Holly discusses in this thread, EA has a long history of encouraging weirdness and experimentation.  From my perspective, freedomandutility is attempting to innovate on this by making us all sticklers for following the law.  And you, as an EA leader, appear to be endorsing this innovation.  You might say that innovating by advocating inaction is different than innovating by advocating action, but (a) I'm a tad skeptical of act/omission distinctions and (b) endorsing an asymmetry like this could create a ratchet where EAs act less and less, because leaders are way more comfortable advocating inaction than action.</p>\n<p>Re: crisis decisionmaking -- my sense is that many EAs feel we are in a crisis, or on the verge of a crisis.  So I do think this is a good time to discuss what's ethically acceptable in a crisis, and what ethical rules would've performed well in past crises.  (For example, one could argue that in a time of crisis, it is especially important to support rather than undermine your friends &amp; allies, and Nonlinear's leadership violated this principle.)</p>\n<p>Thanks for engaging given your limited free time.

I think people should be able to make up their own opinion on this, and I believe they should have the appropriate information to do so.</i></p><p><i>I want to emphasize *just how much* the entire experience of working for Nonlinear was them creating all kinds of obstacles, and me being told that if I\u2019m clever enough I can figure out how to do these tasks anyway. It\u2019s not actually about whether I had a contract and a salary (even then, the issue wasn\u2019t the amount or even the legality, it was that they\u2019d be verbally unclear about what the compensation entailed, eg Emerson saying that since he bought me a laptop in January under the premise of \u201cproductivity tool\u201d, that meant my January salary was actually higher than it would have been otherwise, even though it was never said that the laptop was considered as part of the compensation when we discussed it, and I had not initiated the purchase of it), or whether I was asked to do illegal things and what constitutes as okay illegal vs not okay illegal - it\u2019s the fact that they threw some impossibly complex setup at us, told us we can have whatever we want, if we are clever enough with negotiating (by us I mostly mean me and Alice). And boy did we have to negotiate. I needed to run a medical errand for myself in Puerto Rico and the amount of negotiating I needed to do to get them to drive me to a different city that was a 30 min drive away was wild. I needed to go there three times, and I knew the answer of anyone driving me would be that it\u2019s not worth their time, at the same time getting taxis was difficult while we were living in isolated mountain towns, and obviously it would have been easiest to have Drew or Emerson drive me. I looked up tourism things to do in that city, and tried to use things like \u201chey this city is the only one that has a store that sells Emerson\u2019s favorite breakfast cereal and I could stock up for weeks if we could just get there somehow\u201d. Also - this kind of going out of your way to get what you wanted or needed was rewarded with the Nonlinear team members giving you \u201cpoints\u201d or calling you a \u201cnegotiation genius\u201d.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Of course I was excited to learn how to drive - I could finally get my tasks done and take care of myself, and have a means to get away from the team when it became too much to be around them. And this is negotiating for just going to a city that\u2019s a 30 minute drive away - three times. Imagine how much I had to negotiate to get someone to drive me to a grocery store to do weekly groceries, and then add to that salary or compensation package negotiations and negotiate whether I could be relieved from having to learn how to buy weed for Kat in every country we went to. I\u2019m still not sure how to concisely describe the frame they prescribed to us (here\u2019s a great post on frame control by Aella that seems relevant&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://aella.substack.com/p/frame-control\"><i><strong><u>https://aella.substack.com/p/frame-control</u></strong></i></a><i><strong>&nbsp;</strong>), but most saliently it included the heavy pep talk of how we could negotiate anything we wanted if we were clever enough, and if we failed - it was implied that we simply weren\u2019t good enough. People get prescribed an hourly rate, based on how much their time is worth at Nonlinear. On the stack of who has most value, it goes Emerson, Kat, Drew, Alice, Chloe. All this in the context where we were isolated, and our finances mostly controlled by Emerson. I\u2019ll add a few stories from my perspective, of how this plays out in practice.</i></p><p><i>Note: These stories are roughly 2 to 3 months into my job, this means 2 to 3 months of needing to find clever solutions to problems that ought to be simple, as well as ongoing negotiations with members of the Nonlinear team, to get the basics of my job done.</i></p><p><i>&nbsp;(\u2159)\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u2026</i></p><p><i>\u201cWhen we were flying to the Bahamas from St Martin, I was given a task of packing up all of Nonlinear\u2019s things (mostly Kat &amp; Emerson) into 5 suitcases. Emerson wanted the suitcases to be below the allowed limit if possible. I estimated that the physical weight of their items would exceed the weight limit of 5 suitcases. I packed and repacked the suitcases 5 to 6 times, after each time Emerson would check my work, say that the suitcases are too heavy, and teach me a new rule according to which to throw things out. Eventually I got it done to a level that Emerson was satisfied with. Him and Kat had been working outside the entire time.</i></p><p><i>In a previous packing scenario I had packed some things like charging cables and similar daily used items too fast, which Emerson did not appreciate, so this time I had left some everyday things around for him to use and grab as the last things. When I said we are packed and ready to go, he looked around the house and got angry at all the things that were lying around that he now had to pack himself - I remember him shouting in anger. I was packing up the cars and didn\u2019t deal with him, just let him be mad in the house. This got Drew pretty frustrated as well, he had witnessed me repacking five bags 5-6 times and also tried to negotiate with Emerson about ditching some things that he refused to leave behind (we carried around 2 mountain bikes, and Emerson tasked me with packing in a beach chair as well). When we got into the car which was packed to the brim, Drew got to driving and as we drove out, he shouted really loudly out of anger. The anger was so real that I parsed it as him making a joke because I could not fathom how angry he was - my immediate response was to laugh. I quickly realized he was serious, I stopped and apologized, to which he responded with something like \u201cno I am actually mad, and you should be too!\u201d - related to how much we had to pack up. (2/6)\u201c</i></p><p><i>\u2026</i></p><p><i>\u201cKat had asked me to buy her a specific blonde hair coloring, at the time she told me it\u2019s urgent since she had grown out her natural hair quite a lot. We were living in St Martin where they simply do not sell extreme blond coloring in the specific shade I needed to find, and Amazon does not deliver to St Martin. I also needed to grab this hair coloring while doing weekly groceries. One important guideline I needed to follow for groceries was that it had to be roughly a 10 min car trip but they were frequently disappointed if I didn\u2019t get all their necessities shopped for from local stores so I naturally ventured further sometimes to make sure I got what they asked for.</i></p><p><i>I ended up spending hours looking for that blonde hair coloring in different stores, pharmacies, and beauty stores, across multiple weekly grocery trips. I kept Kat updated on this. Eventually I found the exact shade she asked for - Kat was happy to receive this but proceeded to not color her hair with it for another two weeks. Then we had to pack up to travel to the Bahamas. The packing was difficult (see previous paragraph) - we were struggling with throwing unnecessary things out. The hair color had seemed pretty important, and I thought Bahamas would also be a tricky place to buy that haircolor from, so I had packed it in. We get to the airport, waiting in the queue to check in the suitcases. Kat decides to open up the suitcases to see which last minute things we can throw out to make the suitcases lighter. She reaches for the hair color and happily throws it out. My self worth is in a place where I witness her doing this (she knows how much effort I put into finding this), and I don\u2019t even think to say anything in protest - it just feels natural that my work hours are worth just this much. It\u2019s depressing. (3/6)\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u2026</i></p><p><i>\u201cThere was a time during our stay at St Martin when I was overwhelmed from living and seeing only the same people every single day and needed a day off. Sometimes I\u2019d become so overwhelmed I became really bad at formulating sentences and being in social contexts so I\u2019d take a day off and go somewhere on the island where I could be on my own, away from the whole team - I\u2019ve never before and after experienced an actual lack of being able to formulate sentences just from being around the same people for too long. This was one of these times. We had guests over and the team with the guests had decided in the morning that it\u2019s a good vacation day for going to St Barths. I laid low because I thought since I\u2019m also on a weekend day, it would not be mine to organize (me and Kat would take off Tuesdays and Saturdays, these were sometimes called weekend or vacation days).</i></p><p><i>Emerson approaches me to ask if I can set up the trip. I tell him I really need the vacation day for myself. He says something like \u201cbut organizing stuff is fun for you!\u201d. I don\u2019t know how to respond nor how to get out of it, I don\u2019t feel like I have the energy to negotiate with him so I start work, hoping that if I get it done quickly, I can have the rest of the day for myself.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>I didn\u2019t have time to eat, had just woken up, and the actual task itself required to rally up 7 people and figure out their passport situation as well as if they want to join. St Barths means entering a different country, which meant that I needed to check in with the passport as well as covid requirements and whether all 7 people can actually join. I needed to quickly book some ferry tickets there and back for the day, rally the people to the cars and get to the ferry - all of this within less than an hour. We were late and annoyed the ferry employees - but this is one of the things generally ignored by the Nonlinear team, us being late but getting our way is a sign of our agency and how we aren\u2019t NPCs that just follow the prescribed ferry times - they\u2019re negotiable after all, if we can get away with getting to St Barths anyway.</i></p><p><i>I thought my work was done. We got to the island, my plan was to make the most of it and go on my own somewhere but Emerson says he wants an ATV to travel around with and without an ATV it\u2019s a bit pointless. Everyone sits down at a lovely cafe to have coffee and chit chat, while I\u2019m running around to car and ATV rentals to see what they have to offer. All ATVs have been rented out - it\u2019s tourist season. I check back in, Emerson says I need to call all the places on the island and keep trying. I call all the places I can find, this is about 10 places (small island). No luck. Eventually Emerson agrees that using a moped will be okay, and that\u2019s when I get relieved from my work tasks.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>I did describe this to Kat in my next meeting with her that it\u2019s not okay for me to have to do work tasks while I\u2019m on my weekends, and she agreed but we struggled to figure out a solution that would make sense. It remained more of a \u201clet\u2019s see how this plays out\u201d. (4/6)\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u2026</i></p><p><i>\u201cOne of my tasks was to buy weed for Kat, in countries where weed is illegal. When I kept not doing it and saying that it was because I didn\u2019t know how to buy weed, Kat wanted to sit me down and teach me how to do it. I refused and asked if I could just not do it. She kept insisting that I\u2019m saying that because I\u2019m being silly and worry too much and that buying weed is really easy, everybody does it. I wasn\u2019t comfortable with it and insisted on not doing this task. She said we should talk about it when I\u2019m feeling less emotional about it. We never got to that discussion because in the next meeting I had with her I quit my job. (\u215a)\u201d</i></p><p><i>\u2026</i></p><p><i>\u201cThe aftermath of this experience lasted for several months. Working and living with Nonlinear had me forget who I was, and lose more self worth than I had ever lost in my life. I wasn\u2019t able to read books anymore, nor keep my focus in meetings for longer than 2 minutes, I couldn\u2019t process my own thoughts or anything that took more than a few minutes of paying attention. I was unable to work for a few months. I was scared to share my experiences, terrified that Emerson or Kat would retaliate. While working with them I had forgotten that I used to be excited for work, and getting new tasks would spark curiosity on how to solve them best, rather than feelings of overwhelm.

As someone who lived in East Asia for 7 months across as many different islands/regions, it is really hard to be productive and happy for me in that type of nomadic life. I think it's hard for most people.

So I think re: job listings:</p><ul><li>Necessary travel should not be listed as a job perk, but a key job <i><strong>trait</strong></i><strong> </strong>with both pros and cons and emphasis on suitability for certain <i>less than common</i> personalities. And hirers for travelling positions should try really hard to sort out the people who won't like it.</li><li>It should be made clear how much of an assistant's job description is literally \"dealing with the hassles of travel and working abroad for the team\". <i><strong>To their credit</strong>,</i> the NonLinear job listings do address this, but it is at the bottom and general. I mean it should be semi-granular on the listing, like \"~10 hours/week\", because I think the amount it was for Chloe (sounds substantial) might have been a surprise and added to reasonable resentment and trapped and useless feelings.&nbsp;</li><li>I also think \"helping your boss with their personal tasks\" should be discussed more granularly (maybe it was in interviews IDK, but seems good to get specific early and in writing)</li><li>I additionally suspect (with low confidence because I don't know what's normal in business/nonprofits) that for personal tasks, accounting and pay source should be different for those hours, maybe.</li></ul><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn18qqfm45dodi\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref18qqfm45dodi\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Less relevantly, I have seen Kat promote working abroad and nomadic living as seemingly a really good solution to EAs who follow her on Facebook or her blog. I feel weird that I have not seen Kat post a cons list for travel, but this is a footnote because I also think it isn't generally her responsibility in her personal social media to talk about more than what she is excited about. It is everyone's responsibility to do their own research/not be easily influenced by what they see on social media.

But before I ask, I want to clarify that there's no pressure at all. It's completely up to you as I bet I can wrangle people to turntake as things come up instead. If you want to take it on though, we can discuss how to make up for your day off or what overtime pay makes sense. Feeling keen or no?</li><li>Hi Chloe, asking as a friend, not your boss.. We were thinking of going to St. Barths and we wonder what might be your happy price for helping today? Or do you not even want to be engaged with in this way and want your days off to be sacrosanct? I understand that navigating the social stuff while also being employed by me is probably awkward and I'd like to give you the chance to take the lead and clarify on what feels beneficial, not just passably appropriate, for me to ask you about bonus tasks like this.

I am noticing that I want you to have time to think about it, but then feel conflicted that I am on a deadline to make this St. Barth's trip happen. So let's get some quick takes, and if you still aren't sure, hang back and just enjoy your day to yourself as you planned and as I've noticed you like to do :) Sound good?

Raise your hand if you're coming and I'll delegate something to you, you can trade your tasks if you want. Chloe could you chime in if you think I'm missing anything? [Everyone, before they head out: Thanks Chloe, enjoy your day :) ]</li><li>[If Chloe helps, with or without bonus pay, give lots of check-ins and thanks throughout the day]<br><br>I mean, it would depend on how everybody is/the feel of the group, and how much Chloe was needed Sunday, and how much this is considered personal (make offer out of my pocket/crowdfund out of group's personal pockets, eg \"guys before I ask Chloe to work on her day off is anyone willing to put some money forward for her overtime pay? Let's get some revealed preferences out in the open as to how much we really want this trip and need help with it) vs professional (okay it can be considered a teambuilding exercise but it forces you the leader to think how important it is compared to next week's work because she <i>will</i> need more time off).<br><br>But I feel pretty confident that people can patchwork something together to make this type of thing feel happy and good.

It can <i>tempt</i> you to do bad things, but lots of healthy and normal goals pose temptation risks (e.g., \"I like food, so I'll overeat\" or \"I like good TV shows, so I'll stay up too late binging this one\"); you can resist the temptation without stigmatizing the underlying human value.</p><p>In this case, I think the bad behavior by Nonlinear <i>also</i> would have been bad if it had nothing to do with \"Nonlinear wants to protect its reputation\".</p><p>Like, suppose Alice honestly believed that malaria nets are useless for preventing malaria, and Alice was going around Berkeley spreading this (false) information. Kat sends Alice a text message saying, in effect, \"I have lots of power over you, and dirt I could share to destroy you if you go against me. I demand that you stop telling others your beliefs about malaria nets, or I'll leak true information that causes you great harm.\"</p><p>On the face of it, this is <i>more</i> justifiable than \"threatening Alice in order to protect my org's reputation\". Hypothetical-Kat would be fighting for what's true, on a topic of broad interest where she doesn't stand to personally benefit. Yet I claim this would be a terrible text message to send, and a community where this was normalized would be enormously more toxic than the actual EA community is today.</p><p>Likewise, suppose Ben was planning to write a terrible, poorly-researched blog post called Malaria Nets Are Useless for Preventing Malaria. Out of pure altruistic compassion for the victims of malaria, and a concern for EA's epistemics and understanding of reality, Hypothetical-Emerson digs up a law that superficially sounds like it forbids Ben writing the post, and he sends Ben an email threatening to take Ben to court and financially ruin him if he releases the post.</p><p>(We can further suppose that Hypothetical-Emerson lies in the email 'this is a totally open-and-shut case, if this went to trial you would definitely lose', in a further attempt to intimidate and pressure Ben.

I'm usually reluctant to accuse people of lying, but that just seems to be what happened here?)</p><p>Again, I'd say that this Hypothetical-Emerson (in spite of the \"purer\" motives) would be doing something thoroughly unethical by sending such an email, and a community where people routinely responded to good-faith factual disagreements with threatening emails, frivolous lawsuits, and lies, would be vastly more toxic and broken than the actual EA community is today.</p>", "parentCommentId": "ersqqn7Qm3f9Wwmde", "user": {"username": "RobBensinger"}}, {"_id": "ppmZW7iMdiZp9NHPw", "postedAt": "2023-09-12T00:14:11.283Z", "postId": "32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH", "htmlBody": "<p>Can you share what you mean by \"intimidating behavior\"?

They would send me to work in some warehouse for a few days, and draw up the contract for that work afterwards. Including me falsifying the date for my signature.

I don't deny that the effects of defamation-focused civil litigation can be devastating, but the effects of defamation itself are often at least as bad. Before making this post, which caused enormous reputational damage to Nonlinear (a group I heard about only through this drama), Ben spent a total of three hours hearing their responses and refused to give them requested time to make more of their side clear in advance. Inasmuch as he got anything wrong in it, the errors are serious and have caused serious damage of precisely the sort that courts are a last-resort remedy for.</p><p>People should not feel like they have no recourse beyond submitting to the court of public opinion, with all its flaws and biases. I'm mostly an outsider to the EA community, and while I respect the people within it as clear thinkers, I don't trust \"keep it in the family\" as the sole approach with EA more than I do in any other community. I believe that in a case like this, a threat of a defamation lawsuit should be seen not as a dramatic escalation, but as a predictable and proportionate response to a threat to destroy someone's reputation within their own community, independent of the merits of either party's claim. It's not straightforwardly clear to me that one causes more devastation than the other.</p>", "parentCommentId": "hKEEMnGCcMEmfgnem", "user": {"username": "TracingWoodgrains"}}, {"_id": "CC9GFDdCiSeBeEquf", "postedAt": "2024-01-09T03:40:01.390Z", "postId": "32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH", "htmlBody": "<p>Update: the Eight Circuit has just <a href=\"https://reason.com/volokh/2024/01/08/eighth-circuit-upholds-ban-on-material-lies-on-certain-employment-applications-when-speaker-intends-to-cause-injury/\">upheld a ban</a> in Iowa on using deception to gain employment in order to cause economic harm to the employer.
