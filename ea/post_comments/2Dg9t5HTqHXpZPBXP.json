For example for LessWrong, our ToS includes very few commitments by us, and I definitely don't see myself as having committed to never changing them. If we have a clause in our ToS that asks users to not make too many API requests in quick succession, then I definitely have not committed to not serve people who nevertheless make that many requests (indeed in many cases like search engines or users asking us for rate-limiting exceptions to build things like greaterwrong.com, I have totally changed how we treat users who make too many requests).&nbsp;</p><p>Framing it as having gone back on a commitment seems kind of deceptive to me.</p><p>I also think there is something broader that is off about organizing \"Pause AI\" protests that then advocate for things that seem mostly unrelated to pausing AI to me (and instead lean into other controversial topics).

If their ethical and safety boundaries can be revised out of convenience, they cannot be trusted.</p></blockquote><p>There's a lot going on in Mikhail's post. I am trying to figure out where the major disagreements actually lie. Here is my own tentative analysis:</p><p>If I (1) knew ~nothing about AI safety, (2) received a flyer with this language, and (3) later learned that the work with the Pentagon was only on open-source cybersecurity stuff +/- veteran suicide prevention, then I would feel that (4) the flyer was significantly misleading and (5) I would be unlikely to listen to that organization anymore.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6ja22lmrjdu\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6ja22lmrjdu\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I'd probably have a slightly more favorable opinion of OpenAI and have slightly fewer concerns about AI safety than if I had never received the flyer.</p><p>I find the paragraph significantly misleading for two reasons. First, (6) although there is a balance between conciseness and fidelity, the failure to disclose the nature of the Pentagon-related work is problematic under these circumstances. (7) Without such a disclosure, it is highly likely that an ordinarily reader will assume the work is related to more traditional military activities than open-source cybersecurity. Second, (8) given the lack of specificity in \"Pentagon as a client,\" the implied contrast is with the prior sentence -- sharpened by the use of \"Then\" at the start of the second sentence. The first sentence is about \"high chance of causing harm,\" and \"military and warfare\" uses of OpenAI's work. (9) The difference between \"charter\" and \"usage policy\" is not material to the analysis above.</p><p>(10) Strategically, I think it is important not to push the envelope with advocacy pieces that a reasonable reader could find to be misleading. If the reader concludes that both sides of an issue are full of \"spin,\" s/he is most likely to respond with inaction -- which is generally to the benefit of the disputant holding more power. Also, the disputant with the bigger megaphone has an advantage in those circumstances, and pro-AI forces are loaded.</p><p>(11) I have no opinion on whether the flyer was \"deceptive\" or \"deontologically bad\" because (12) those judgments imply evaluation of the intent (or other culpable mental state) of the author.</p><p>From the discussion so far, I'm not sure how many of those points are the subject of disagreement.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn6ja22lmrjdu\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref6ja22lmrjdu\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Given (1), a large negative update on the org's reliability and a choice not to invest further resources into a more accurate appraisal would make sense.</p></div></li></ol>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Jason"}}, {"_id": "9ZwKY8bQSzRY59iG6", "postedAt": "2024-02-14T02:05:12.916Z", "postId": "2Dg9t5HTqHXpZPBXP", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>I do think that even after correcting the \"charter\"-mistake you continued to frame OpenAI usage policies as something that should be treated as some kind of contractual commitment of OpenAI that they walked back.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>I see what you mean here, and I might even have done this a bit because of the conflation of the two documents in my head that didn't get backpropagated away.

I.e., it gives people a wrong impression of the world, in a way a part of the community assumed would be better suiting their goals.

I don\u2019t even mention the names of the protest organisers or their orgs, because I care about the community preventing deceptive messaging in the future.</p>\n<p>It doesn\u2019t have to be a community-wide mechanism or a central org that checks press-releases; it can be more field-focused orgs and people, it can be practices like fact-checking final versions of public comms and edits to them with outside people who are good at that stuff and have a different background (see comments from @Jason), it can be any of lots of things. I want the community to think about those things and discuss them. I\u2019d be optimistic about people spending time to figure this out and suggesting to the community.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>my impression is that the organisers have tried to correct the mistake to the extent that they believes they made a mistake, and anything else is going to be a matter of public debate.

I\u2019m not confident this is what happened, though, as looking at the messages now, it seems fairly likely that an organiser understood the impression the messaging would create and decided to keep it that way.</p>\n<p>3- I don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair to, while no one of us spent a while thinking about potential mechanisms, suggest those that seem like they wouldn\u2019t seem good/work. Current mechanisms are bad, as they don\u2019t prevent deontologically dubious unilateral actions. I hope there can be better mechanisms.</p>\n<p>I think the community as a whole acted deceptively. This seems really bad and the community should probably respond and improve. We don\u2019t want to be the kind of community that misleads people when it suits our goals. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s been a reaction from the community where people tried to figure out how to address the problem. Instead, most of the comments are related to a protest organiser slowly realising what the issue people are talking about was.</p>\n<p>2- I notice I\u2019m confused and don\u2019t really get your point. Like, yeah, in global health and development, deceptive messaging is obviously enough unlikely be beneficial for people to not do it and not have much reason to engage with another part of the community having issues around deceptive messaging, so this is not a post that seems relevant to all the community to the extent some parts of the community identify only with these parts and not with the whole. But this is not what you\u2019re saying; and I\u2019m failing to understand your point. If we\u2019re discussing a cause area (x-risk) and deceptive messaging and potentially bad consequences of it, how are other cause area relevant here? I rarely go around shrimp welfare posts, saying that I don\u2019t care about these deep sea shenanigans, and people should donate to MIRI instead.</p>\n<p>1- I think better communication could\u2019ve reduced the amount of public drama; but also there\u2019s not a lot of it here, and I\u2019m more concerned with the community not engaging enough with the problems raised in the post.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Thank you for linking the public tweets discussing deontology.</strong> If someone believes it\u2019s OK to violate deontological norms if they calculate the consequences to be positive, I want them to directly say that. If someone decided deceptive messaging can be fine and was ok in this case, I want them to directly say that and not be deceptive towards the community as well.

Among more specific things, I mentioned that \"It seems generally good to try to be maximally honest and non-deceptive\".</p><p><strong>At or before this point, you didn't tell me anything about \"not needing more of my input\".</strong> And you didn't tell me anything like \"I made my decisions\".</p><p>On February 4th, I attended your EAG talk, and on February 5th, I messaged you that it was great and that I was glad you gave it.<br><br>Then, on February 6, you invited me to join your Twitter space (about this protest) and I got promoted to a speaker. I didn't get a chance to share my thoughts about allying with people promoting locally invalid views, and I shared them publicly on Twitter and privately with you on Messenger, including a quote I was asked to not share publicly until an LW dialogue is up. We chatted a little bit about general goals and allying with people with different views. You told me, \"You have a lot of opinions and I\u2019d be happy to see you organize your own protests\". I replied, \"Sure, I might if I think it\u2019s useful:)\" and after a message sharing my confusion regarding one of your previous messages, didn't share any more \"opinions\". This could be interpreted as indirectly telling me you didn't need my input, but that was a week after I shared my concerns about the messaging being misleading, and you still didn't tell me anything about having made your decisions.</p><p>A day before the protest, I shared a picture of a sign I wanted to bring to the protest, and asked \"Hey, is it alright if I print and show up to the protest with something like this?\", because I wouldn't want to attend the protest if you weren't ok with the sign. You replied that it was ok, shared some thoughts, and told me that you liked the sentiment as it supports the overall impression that you want, so I brought the sign to the protest:</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:34.56%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FuRqA8LGfQGqEviTy/j7qvmchu3szwngbn95px\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FuRqA8LGfQGqEviTy/lig1ad3zdeis3cki47ly 90w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FuRqA8LGfQGqEviTy/dlskg8gwniecvx4ksafk 180w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FuRqA8LGfQGqEviTy/cytwgf8v2abis7pv1jj8 270w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FuRqA8LGfQGqEviTy/tndjlrdxd0vawclexnhh 360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FuRqA8LGfQGqEviTy/mnssuzfgvdnqbduypbog 450w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FuRqA8LGfQGqEviTy/o2oa0vrvzpzcz5gxuogt 540w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FuRqA8LGfQGqEviTy/q2osborcvxddmfmp6hs3 630w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FuRqA8LGfQGqEviTy/s821vpbxcxuts45nxe0k 720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FuRqA8LGfQGqEviTy/bcrv7543eqfjvruoorxe 810w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FuRqA8LGfQGqEviTy/sxnxzj8pejhxb1rangsa 856w\"></figure><p>After the protest, I shared the draft of this post with you.
