However, I am less concerned about these critiques when applied to this specific analysis, since this case is just comparing two animal welfare interventions. Critiques of the RP moral weights applied to this case would need to make an argument for why the relative weights of chicken and shrimp are wrong, not the absolute weights.

It\u2019s very tempting to compute a massive EV for this by doing a calculation like (small chance that this brings industry-wide adoption forward n years) * (400 billion shrimp farmed/year) = giant number. But I think that\u2019s probably a bad way to look at it. I think the better way to think of it is that industry-wide adoption would take a successful pilot plus other forms of activism like corporate campaigns, ballot initiatives, or legislative lobbying. So the pilot alone isn\u2019t necessarily bringing forward broader adoption, but rather creating new potentially cost-effective opportunities for donations. The exact EV would therefore depend on questions like the relative cost-effectiveness of those new donation opportunities compared to the existing animal welfare portfolio, and on how funding constrained the animal welfare space is expected to be over the next several years.</p><p>None of this is to say that I disagree with your point, just that I\u2019m quite uncertain about the indirect cost effectiveness and would struggle to find a way to easily model it.</p>", "parentCommentId": "JhARr4scH674W3pQe", "user": {"username": "MHR"}}, {"_id": "32DFTgvnvcrx4Eg2W", "postedAt": "2023-07-28T11:35:05.637Z", "postId": "CmAexqqvnRLcBojpB", "htmlBody": "<p>I think the edits you made to the summary work very well in making it clear what the quantitative analysis does and doesn't cover! &nbsp;Thank you for taking on board my comments so promptly.</p><p>Fully agree with your points on the difficulty of quantifying the indirect benefits, and also how/where those benefits should be attributed. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>I think the challenge is that excluding indirect benefits from a quantitative analysis effectively assigns them a zero value.

Rather than including the below in that post, we thought it made sense to continue the discussion that had already started here.</p><ul><li>Considerations around the&nbsp;<strong>\u201c</strong><a href=\"https://welfarefootprint.org/research-projects/pain-tracks/\"><strong><u>Pain-Track</u></strong></a><strong>\u201d for this intervention</strong>, for example:<ul><li>The intervention targets acute rather than chronic suffering. In some Pain-Tracks,&nbsp;<strong>Time spent suffering can overwhelmingly dominate the calculation of suffering</strong> (though this also depends on the relative intensity of the chronic suffering compared to the acute suffering).</li><li>Similarly, how you weigh the relative suffering of Annoying, Hurtful, Disabling, and Excruciating pains can be a deciding factor. It\u2019s possible that these are within orders of magnitude of each other, but it\u2019s also possible to view \u201cExcruciating\u201d pain as being&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xtcgsLA2G8bn8vj99/reminding-myself-just-how-awful-pain-can-get-plus-an#Question_3__How_does_intense_pain_compare_morally_to_mild_pain_\"><u>infinitely worse</u></a> than other types of pain (and similarly to Time as a factor,<strong> if Excruciating pain is weighted high enough, then any time in this state can end up dominating the overall calculation</strong> for the Pain-Track).</li></ul></li><li>The relative&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/y5n47MfgrKvTLE3pw/p/tnSg6o7crcHFLc395\"><u>welfare range</u></a> of shrimps - in particular,&nbsp;<strong>whether the undiluted experience model of welfare is correct or not</strong> - is another consideration that can dominate cost-effectiveness calculations (largely because the number of shrimps&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Fhoq7tP9LYPqaJDxx/shrimp-the-animals-most-commonly-used-and-killed-for-food\"><u>used and killed for food</u></a> is so large),</li><li>The&nbsp;<strong>likelihood that we accelerate the adoption of humane slaughter practices</strong> - both in terms of the shorter term goal of producers buying further stunners themselves, and the longer-term goal of electrical stunning becoming the norm in the industry.<ul><li>For example, we have one producer who is committed to stunning 100M shrimps, which represents 8% of their shrimps. If the \u201cpilot\u201d is successful, they will likely buy further stunners to stun most (if not all) of their shrimps. This would mean our investment of $65,000 would be the first domino leading to ~1.25B shrimps being stunned per year.</li><li>Additionally, once a buyer has seen that it\u2019s possible for their suppliers to implement stunners, they can be empowered to require that all of their suppliers stun their shrimps (or otherwise source from suppliers who already stun).</li><li>Finally, many certifiers/policymakers are unwilling to require the industry to do things until it has been relatively established. We\u2019re unsure what the timelines of work like this might be, but believe that by counterfactually introducing stunners to the industry earlier than they would have been, it could lead to widespread adoption being accelerated by a number of years.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Any potential \u201cimpact ceiling\u201d we might hit with buying stunners</strong> - if the pool of producers large enough to stun a minimum of 100M shrimps and willing to take up our offer of a stunner is smaller than we currently estimate, then this could limit the potential scale of impact. Likewise, the potential pool could be larger than we realise, for example, we may find a number of smaller producers who want to take a stunner but can\u2019t commit to 100M shrimps, in which case we could offer to pro-rata our contribution, and work with a larger pool of producers at a similar cost-effectiveness.</li><li>Finally, we see hard-to-quantify value in&nbsp;<strong>whether this intervention helps to diversify interventions in the animal welfare space</strong>. Both the decision to focus on shrimps, and to purchase equipment for the industry, are both somewhat novel \u201cbets\u201d that seem to have paid off. We hope that this is encouraging for the movement more broadly to continue to invest in exploratory work in the space.</li></ul>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "AaronBoddy"}}, {"_id": "Z273PbkkScZWYbgu6", "postedAt": "2023-10-24T10:14:26.859Z", "postId": "CmAexqqvnRLcBojpB", "htmlBody": "<p>TL;DR: <strong>I think donations to SWP may be in the conversation for the single most cost-effective opportunity available to humanity.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just saw this comment by chance when doing some of my usual late-night reading about shrimp welfare, and thought I'd reply because somebody mentioned me on the internet!</p><p>I've thought about this specific question (weightings between the different pain categories) at length, and there's quite a bit of uncertainty as with any esoteric area of philosophy. I don't put that much weight on my own experience that Michael described (as these decisions are too important to rely on my own experiences). I know a few people are thinking about this, so I've seen what various people have written about this; a small amount of academic research; some informal surveys; and a fair amount of philosophy. I think that any discussion of this topic needs to acknowledge this uncertainty. I think in a couple of years, we'll be in a much more informed position about the trade-offs between pain categories, perhaps with the exception of excruciating pain.</p><p>I've also given shrimp welfare and shrimp stunning some detailed thought (and my colleagues will know just how critical and conservative I am when conducting research!).</p><p>That said:</p><ul><li>I agree that 6.67x (disabling:hurtful) and 5x (excruciating:disabling) are conservative.</li><li>In my work, I use many sets of weightings, and I assign a rough probability to each one. The weighted mean is quite close to those above numbers. But averages obscure, which is why I use a set of weightings to arrive at a more informed judgement about any particular decision.</li><li>I think there's a &gt;30% chance that disabling:hurtful is above 15x (rather than 6.67x) and that excruciating:disabling is above 100x (rather than 5x).

Some healthy uncertainty around the pain weightings doesn't change that.</p><p>Also, might be worth saying that if anybody strongly disagrees with this claim, I'd be keen to collaborate on a cost-effectiveness analysis of SWP and some other highly cost-effective opportunity (especially outside of the animal space) to see where the cruxes are.</p>", "parentCommentId": "xpLE5HjMYyARwxJks", "user": {"username": "Ren Springlea"}}]
