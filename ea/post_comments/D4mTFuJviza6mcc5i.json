For those reasons, moving to eaforum.org doesn't feel like a significant forward step to me. What might feel more exciting is combining the various pages into something like book.effectivealtruism.com, blog.effectivealtruism.com, wiki.effectivealtruism.com at a later date...

People have pointed out, correctly in my view, that the movement could stand to be more coordinated in terms of letting each other know what we're working on and this could be an important step in that direction.  This would be a pretty big project though, especially if the interfaces got unified.  I wonder if we could put them all under effective.org, altruism.org, impact.org, or something cool like that?</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "qj8GLmoRgmZnaFj4A", "user": {"username": "John_Maxwell_IV"}}]
