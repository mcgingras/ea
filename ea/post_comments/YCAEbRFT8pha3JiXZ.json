There have been quite a few times when discussions around the usefulness of historical studies has come up and it might be good to share ideas and collaborate.</p>\n<p>I don't have time to try and coordinate this at the moment, but it seems like trying to establish some sort of discussion forum (or organisation?) for using the study of history to advance our understanding of (and strategy towards) cause areas which are often prioritised within EA.</p>\n<p>If this is something you (or anyone else seeing this) has an interest in me developing, it's something to bear in mind? People should feel free to contact me at james_a_harris [at] hotmail.co.uk if you want to talk about it further.</p>\n<p>Examples: I'm thinking primarily within Effective Animal Advocacy (Sentience Institute's study of the British antislavery movement; ACE discontinuing their social studies project; technology adoption being considered as a precedent for clean meat e.g. by Sentience Institute and Paul Shapiro) but this would also apply to other fields. The systematic approach described in the post linked at [1] seems to correlate more closely with the approach Holden and others took at OPP than it does the studies done in the Effective Animal Advocacy sphere.</p>\n<p>[1] <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1lz/why_we_should_be_doing_more_systematic_research/\">http://effective-altruism.com/ea/1lz/why_we_should_be_doing_more_systematic_research/</a> </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "5FBJppAnQak5EsnNt", "user": {"username": "Jamie_Harris"}}, {"_id": "Nv3WioEAZS3Qp4EHu", "postedAt": "2018-04-06T23:39:35.088Z", "postId": "YCAEbRFT8pha3JiXZ", "htmlBody": "<p>just emailed you. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "TYKgRPxdB5F58e3Wt", "user": {"username": "MichaelPlant"}}, {"_id": "AeeCDqQx4SRxj9emK", "postedAt": "2018-04-12T23:29:36.095Z", "postId": "YCAEbRFT8pha3JiXZ", "htmlBody": "<p>What are the stages of the application process?
