Interestingly, I lived with someone in the agriculture corps, an initiative by U.S. ag to promote its image by helping developing countries. I think it probably has the effect of putting them more firmly on a factory farming path, sadly.</p>\n<p>The ag corps member would always talk about how terrible animal husbandry in Ghana was, and I was pretty shocked. After all, at least the chickens, goats, and sheep roamed freely. She noted that but said that they eat garbage, and their slaughter is frequently botched. To me, eating garbage seemed like a very small harm next to living your life in a tiny stall or extremely crowded barn. At the end of the discussion, I realized that she thought their animal husbandry was worse than that in the U.S. because her college ag classes had equated good animal husbandry practices with standard industrial practices, so sloppy practices\u2013even if they allowed for more freedom\u2013were worse in her view.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "zdgroff"}}, {"_id": "NG6krawzKnEv2weib", "postedAt": "2020-06-29T08:00:37.318Z", "postId": "PkSncEsBgHkz5iD5E", "htmlBody": "<html><head></head><body><p>Hello!
