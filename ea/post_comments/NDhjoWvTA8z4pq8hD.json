Thanks again for point out the issue.</p>\n<p>We cover a lot of ground in those reports, and much of it corroborates what you say in this post. I'm not sure where the assumption of exponential growth comes from, however. Our research has shown that the proportion of vegans/vegetarians has not increased substantially in the past decade. There may be exponential growth with Google searches of the term &quot;vegan,&quot; but that doesn't mean the vegan population is growing.</p>\n<p>Rather, the reduction in farmed animal slaughter and the rise of vegan food alternatives is being driven by &quot;part-time&quot; abstainers. That's where we see the exponential growth. With that said, I certainly agree the growth rate is more important than the absolute number of vegans. The challenge is that research on low-incidence populations like vegans/vegetarians is hard, especially when tracking changes over time.</p>\n<p>In addition to helping people maintain a nutritious and plentiful diet while being veg*n, animal advocate also need to work on making veganism less of a purist identity and to make it more inclusive. Following are the recommendations copied from our report:</p>\n<p>Improve Vegetarian/Vegan Retention</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Target Demographics \u2013 Target outreach activities toward those who are most likely to adhere to the diet. Current and lapsed vegetarians/\nvegans differ significantly when it comes to their age, political orientation, and religious beliefs. Current vegetarians/vegans are also more\nlikely to have adopted the diet at a younger age and to have transitioned more gradually.</li>\n<li>Increase the Focus on the \u201cHow\u201d of Vegetarianism/Veganism \u2013 1) Design outreach and supporting efforts to address the most common\ndifficulties faced by former vegetarians/vegans, including: cravings and boredom with food options; insufficient interaction with other\nvegetarians/vegans; not being actively involved in a vegetarian/vegan community; not seeing the diet as part of their identity; disliking that\ntheir diet made them \u201cstick out from the crowd;\u201d and feeling it was too difficult to be \u201cpure\u201d with their diet. Interestingly, health did not present\na noticeable difficulty for study participants, with the exception of vitamin B12 monitoring. 2) Consider increasing awareness about the\nimportance of B12: a far greater percentage of former (76%) than current (42%) vegetarians/vegans never had their B12 levels checked\nwhile they were adhering to the diet. 3) Think about barriers in the domestic sphere, including the fact that 33% of former vegetarians/\nvegans were living with a non-vegetarian/vegan significant other when they lapsed. With about a third (34%) of lapsed vegetarians/vegans\nreporting that they ate the diet for three months or less, the window for advocates to help individuals find ways to sustain their\nvegetarianism/veganism is small. While this window is still open, think of vegetarian/vegan advocacy as a longer-term relationship, not just\na single point of outreach.</li>\n<li>Diversify Messaging for the \u201cWhy\u201d of Vegetarianism/Veganism \u2013 Current vegetarians/vegans report a broader range of motivations for\neating their diet than do former vegetarians/vegans. While the only motivation cited by a majority of former vegetarians/vegans (58%) was\nhealth, a number of motivations were identified by a majority of current vegetarians/vegans: health (69%), animal protection (68%), concern\nfor the environment (59%), feelings of disgust about meat/animal products (63%), and taste preferences (52%).</li>\n<li>Focus on Lapsed Vegetarians/Vegans \u2013 More than a third (37%) of former vegetarians/vegans are interested in re-adopting the diet, and a\nmajority of these individuals say they are likely or very likely to do so, with health being the primary motivator. If even half of the individuals\nwho express an interest were to resume the diet, that would double the number of current vegetarians/vegans in the U.S. Some thought will\nbe needed, however, to come up with an advocacy approach that works for these individuals.</li>\n</ul>\n", "parentCommentId": "Tz9B3F4i9XyiDJNbR", "user": {"username": "chegreen"}}, {"_id": "CXo5SrTXpB2XnKtgB", "postedAt": "2015-07-06T14:11:43.411Z", "postId": "NDhjoWvTA8z4pq8hD", "htmlBody": "<p>i agree with the 80/20 idea, and i wonder we apparently 98% of our movement keeps stuck in black and white thinking. for instance in this case, we are apparently thinking that the question to what level of consumption the vegans are sliding back is irrelevant, but it's not, of course. for one thing, moderate use still saves a lot of animals, for another, every reducer helps make full time veganism more easy, by increasing demand (and thus the supply), the social acceptability, the convenience with which to eat vegan etc... a society where 60% of people are 75% vegan is probably a lot better and closer to a vegan society than one where 10% of the people are full time vegan...</p>\n<p>also, something jonathan saffran foer told me: you know the example of the guy that eats meat again because once he was at an airport and it was the only thing he could it? he fell back entirely. i think that has to do with the fact that we see veganism too much as an identity, and as something binary. when we fail, we might as well give up</p>\n<p>i know the second point is perhaps in contradiction with the first, but maybe they both have some merit somewhere... </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "PcT3DrYeSy2g8t3QF", "user": {"username": "tobiasleenaert"}}, {"_id": "GTYb6xAxYWfPMcctc", "postedAt": "2015-07-06T21:46:21.125Z", "postId": "NDhjoWvTA8z4pq8hD", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you!
