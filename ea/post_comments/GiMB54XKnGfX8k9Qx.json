I imagine a typical matching fundraiser audience are merely generally motivated by the matching without explicitly thinking about counterfactuals. I don't think they take there to be even an implication about counterfactuals, which I imagine is why charities are comfortable with matches (which GiveWell apparently think are typically non-counterfactual). So talking about dishonesty is too strong - not being actively transparent about this element is more on the mark.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "jayd"}}, {"_id": "oawWy3XgiT3gdBYnw", "postedAt": "2015-03-01T17:16:59.131Z", "postId": "GiMB54XKnGfX8k9Qx", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>they thought more money would go to the charities in the matching cases.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In particular, they thought that for each $10 donated, <em>a full additional $10</em> would go to the charity if the match was still active.
