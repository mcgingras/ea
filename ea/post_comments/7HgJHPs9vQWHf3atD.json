Prima facie, talks about animal welfare will make people care about animals more than effectiveness, and will bore some people who don't care about animals. I'd be willing to pay that price if I was fairly sure that animal charities were at least among the most effective but that seems like an unsupportable epistemic position.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, there are good arguments for caring about longer-run impact, so I would favour giving risks/deep time/tech a bigger mention.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "RyanCarey"}}, {"_id": "vNWLDx7CpuQFwT6qH", "postedAt": "2014-12-29T22:41:42.842Z", "postId": "7HgJHPs9vQWHf3atD", "htmlBody": "<p>If I had to make a list of the very best videos, it would be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism.html\">The How and Why of Effective Altruism</a> by Peter Singer (TED)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://new.ted.com/talks/dan_pallotta_the_way_we_think_about_charity_is_dead_wrong\">The Way We Think about Charity is Dead Wrong</a> by Dan Pallotta (TED)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://youtu.be/ZGAkrpwyu1k\">How to save hundreds of lives</a> by Toby Ord (TEDxCambridgeUniversity)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMSU6k5-WXg\">Can we prevent the end of the world?</a> by Martin Rees (TED)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here are some extra introductory materials for a longer list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkRAGE6uaeM\">Nick Beckstead on the Dylan Rattigan Show</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7yzKzgxazo\">Wall St Saves The World</a> - Will MacAskill </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qF26MbYgOA\">Earth in its final century?</a> - Martin Rees</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NEqHML98RgU\">Think Rationally Via Bayes Rule</a> - Julia Galef</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZDVv-MI0VU\">The Future of Life, a Cosmic Perspective</a> - Max Tegmark</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14HjKH19QCI\">Effective altruism to warm our hearts</a> - Frazer Kirkman</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zRmkk2PmNcY\">Choosing for effective altruism</a> - TEDx UniMelb, Helen Toner</li>\n</ul>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "RyanCarey"}}, {"_id": "HDEpDi5jYDvbJQToX", "postedAt": "2014-12-30T00:56:02.336Z", "postId": "7HgJHPs9vQWHf3atD", "htmlBody": "<p>I agree with this assessment. My impression is that concern for animals is much more likely to mind-kill people than concern for either world poverty or the far-future.
