I basically agree with the main argument, including your evaluation of the Tortured Tim case.<br><br>To also share one idea: I wonder whether a variation of the famous experience machine thought experiment can be taken to elicit a contrary intuition to Tortured Tim and whether this should decrease our confidence in your evaluation of the Tortured Tim case. Suppose a subject (call her \"Sarah\") can choose between having blissful experiences in the experience machine and having a moderately net-positive live outside of the machine, involving a rather limited amount of positive prudential (experiential and non-experiential) goods. I take it some (maybe many? maybe most?) would say that Sarah should (prudentially) not choose to enter the machine. If rather few non-experiential goods (maybe together with some positive experiences) can weigh more than the best possible experiences, this suggests that non-experiential goods can be very important, relative to experiential goods.</p><p>A possible reply would be that most of the relevant non-experiential goods might not be relevant, as they might be things like \u201cperceiving reality\u201d or \u201cbeing non-deceived\u201d which all animals trivially satisfy. But, in response, one may reply that the relevant non-experiential good is, e.g., the possession of knowledge which many animals may not be capable of.&nbsp;</p><p>In general, in these kinds of intuitive trade-offs negative experiences seem more important than positive experiences. Few would say that the best non-experiential goods can be more important than the most terrible suffering, but many would say that the best non-experiential goods can be more important than purely the most blissful experiences. Thus, since, in the decision-contexts you have in mind, we mostly care about negative experiences, i.e. animal suffering, this objection may ultimately not be that impactful.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "LeonardDung"}}, {"_id": "E8huChZHdrhjagLoj", "postedAt": "2022-11-15T15:55:27.606Z", "postId": "WfeWN2X4k8w8nTeaS", "htmlBody": "<p>Strong upvoted, I think this is a really excellent point.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "zN2xMNkjKKtmJResd", "user": {"username": "MHR"}}, {"_id": "SCentDvki8nweMZqY", "postedAt": "2022-11-16T00:36:22.003Z", "postId": "WfeWN2X4k8w8nTeaS", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for the question, Vasco!
