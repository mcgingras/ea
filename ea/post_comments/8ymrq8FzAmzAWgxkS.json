Good to see Santos talking about this. I think his message was somewhat undermined by three factors, which you alluded to: (1) commencement speeches are usually optimistic, uplifting platitude-dumps written to be as inoffensive as possible, (2) the Doomsday Clock just doesn't have much credibility or gravitas any more, since its meaning has been diluted from the original 'global nuclear war' focus to all sorts of other concerns, (3) mentioning climate change as if it's an 'existential risk' either doesn't understand what 'existential risk' means, or vastly over-estimates the likely severity of climate change.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "geoffreymiller"}}, {"_id": "gG52s9Jq35NJGwtJ2", "postedAt": "2023-05-26T01:00:16.526Z", "postId": "8ymrq8FzAmzAWgxkS", "htmlBody": "<p>I think this is straightforwardly a good sign (especially how much he focused on AI).
