A family friend, with lots of help from my mom, started an orphanage and school in Zambia. Projects like that are highly dependent on the individuals involved, their priorities, and their honesty. There is not another Kathi in the world and I would expect nearly everyone else to be less effective at trying to accomplish what she has done. Now, if you just want to count bodies, her project is not the most effective at saving lives per dollar. However, just as in nature, one must consider quality as well as quantity. Three of her orphaned formerly street children were in the top five on the national test for admission to high school the first year any of her kids took it. Her goal is to get as many through university as possible, but she also teaches farming and sewing and other skills. She could save more lives, but she wants to give Zambia the educated population it needs to thrive on its own. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": null}, {"_id": "cuGvNQ8QNPNrRJMPK", "postedAt": "2015-02-04T03:17:49.741Z", "postId": "FrSaKohTYqkA4KZYs", "htmlBody": "<p>I suspect that such a criticism does apply.
