Medical care is normally provided by the state for the poorest in the West so let's set that to one side for a moment. For the rest we set a lot of minimum standards on what is available to buy; you can't get rice below some minimum safety standard even if that very low-quality rice is more analogous to the rice eaten by a poor Indian person, I would guess virtually all (maybe actually all?) dwellings in the US have running water, etc.</p>\n<p>This presents difficult problems for making these comparisons, and I think it's part of what Rob is talking about in his point (2). One method that comes to mind is to take your median Indian and find a rich Indian who is 10x richer, then work out how that person compares to poor Americans since (hopefully) the goods they buy have significantly more overlap. Then you might be able to stitch your income distributions together and say something like [poor Indian] = [Rich Indian] / 10 = [Poor American] / 10 = [Rich American] / 100. I have some memory that this is what some of the researchers building these distributions actually do but I can't recall the details offhand; maybe someone more familiar can fill in the blanks.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A realistic minimum amount of money to not die in the west is probably $2000-$5000/year, again without gifts or handouts, implying that to be 100 times richer than the average Indian, you have to be earning at least $200,000-$500,000 net of tax (or at least net of that portion of tax which isn't spent on things that benefit you - which at that level is almost all of it, unless you are somehow getting huge amounts of government money spent on you in particular).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Building on the above, hypothetically suppose over the next 50 years the West continues on its current trend of getting richer and putting more minimum standards in place; the minimum to survive in the West is now $10,000 per year and the now-much-richer countries have a safety net that enables everyone to reach this. However, in India nothing happens. </p>\n<p>Is it now true that I need at least $1,000,000 per year to be 100x richer than the median Indian? That seems peverse. Supposing my income started at $100,000 and stayed constant in real terms throughout, why do increases in minimum standards that basically don't affect me (I was already buying higher-than-minimum-quality things) and don't at all affect the median Indian make me much poorer relative to the median Indian?

This is a helpful overview of some of the challenges in coming up with a single quantitative view.</p>\n<p>Overall, I think this suggests two things about how to display and interpret the relevant data.</p>\n<p>First, when using purely quantitative estimates of distributions in currency terms to illustrate an overall trend, use a variety of different consistent estimates. It seems like when the whole thing you're trying to estimate is income inequality, stitching together different sources for the portions below and above the 80th percentile is very likely to introduce problems. For instance, if your above-80% source is better at detecting income, or otherwise biased upwards relative to your below-80% source, then this will substantially overestimate income inequality.</p>\n<p>I would have liked to instead see the whole curve drawn from PovCalNet numbers, with the trendline from Milanovic overlaid on it. Or, ideally, as many different estimated lines as you can measure on the same axis. It's fine to merely footnote or link to explanations for exactly <em>why</em> the lines differ, how they were generated, and your thoughts on which ones are better estimates for which quantiles, but when you use a single graph, people are likely to assume that it's an authoritative illustration of a single data source, whereas showing multiple estimates makes it clearer that there is uncertainty about the details, but not about the fact that the distribution is very unequal.</p>\n<p>If you're worried that this would lead to a too-noisy graph, I highly recommend Edward Tufte's books for advice on how to visually display a large amount of quantitative information elegantly.</p>\n<p>Second, we shouldn't use these numbers directly to make judgments about specific programs to help poor people. Instead, when trying to evaluate any particular decision, we should make sure we understand how a difference in dollar figures relates to a difference in material conditions, since this will not be perfectly consistent.</p>\n<p>For instance, if you use &quot;purchasing power parity&quot; figures, you may get a better estimate of how big differences in material circumstances are, but at the cost of obscuring things like what percentage of someone's income a cash transfer of a certain size will constitute. For this reason, the work charities like GiveDirectly and JPAL are doing directly reporting on <em>what happens</em> as a result of various interventions is extremely important.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "BenHoffman"}}, {"_id": "WTc6iWoH76KzkQD5P", "postedAt": "2017-04-08T21:47:00.097Z", "postId": "LaXGf6hZXXqZ7sj5m", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks Ben, this sounds reasonable.

My general policy is to go with the expert view when it comes to issues that have been thoroughly researched, unless I've looked into it a lot myself. At 80,000 Hours, we don't see ourselves as experts on measuring global income, so instead go with the World Bank, Milanovic and others. Moreover, to our knowledge, the objections raised here are all well understood by the experts on the topic, and have already been factored into the analyses.</p>\n<p>That said, here a few comments to show why the Milanovic etc. estimates are not obviously wrong. First, I'll state the problem, then consider the arguments.</p>\n<p>I'm claiming that US upper middle class = $100k+ for the reason above.\nThe World Bank estimated 800m people live under $1.9 per day in their 2015 figures, or $600 per year. In reality, many of them will live well below that level. So there's probably hundreds of millions living under $300 per year.\nThis means there's over a factor of 300 difference between &quot;upper middle class&quot; and &quot;large numbers of the global poor&quot;</p>\n<p>So, for the claim to be strictly wrong, the consumption of the poor have to be relatively underestimated by a factor of 3. Given the difficulties in making these estimates, this doesn't seem out of the question, but is not obvious. </p>\n<p>Moreover, for it to be wrong in a way that becomes decision-relevant, you'd need the understatement to be more like a factor of 10. Even then, it would still be true that upper middle class earn 30x what the global poor earn, so they'd still be able to benefit others at little cost of themselves, and have a disproportionate influence on the world. But, it would be less pressing than a 300x difference.</p>\n<p>Here are a couple of reasons why it's not obvious the world bank etc is off by a factor of 10.</p>\n<p>It seems the main argument is that you'd die with under $2/day in the west and no hand-outs, so quality of life is worse than $2 in the developing world.</p>\n<p>Will gives one response to that in another comment. You wouldn't actually die.</p>\n<p>Another point is that it would <em>indeed</em> be harder to live in the west on $2/day, because the low-quality goods that the global poor use are not available to buy. I think the relevant comparison is more like &quot;if there were <em>lots</em> of people living on $2/day in the west, what quality of living would you get?&quot;. It's artificial to imagine one person living in extreme poverty without a market and community around them. The PPP adjustments are meant as a hypothetical &quot;what you could buy on $2 per day if the same goods were sold in stores, or if there were lots of other poor people in the country&quot;. (Though of course this is one reason why the comparisons are difficult conceptually.)</p>\n<p>You've argued that the incomes of the poor are understated, but I think the incomes of the rich are also understated. As an inhabitant of a rich country, you get to consume lots of extra public goods that aren't fully included in the post-tax income figures in these data-sets e.g. safety, clean air, beautiful buildings, being surrounded by lots of educated people. You wouldn't get as many of these in a poor community in a poor country, so this is a way in which the global poor are relatively <em>even worse</em> off than the income comparisons suggest.</p>\n<p>Finally, you mention cost of living in another comment as being relevant. Our audience lives in cities where cost of living is higher, making them relatively poorer. However, I think this might be a red herring. Generally, people move to a city to get higher income. If the market is roughly efficient, then the income boost from being in a city should at least offset the increase in cost of living. So it factors out of the equation.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "GuPg7cg3yEZcRdEfo", "user": {"username": "Benjamin_Todd"}}, {"_id": "AgZQ567puceMK76Zc", "postedAt": "2017-04-12T04:22:43.340Z", "postId": "LaXGf6hZXXqZ7sj5m", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>\u201cThis is a problem on the level of \u201cthis chart was cooked up specifically to favor the intended conclusion....\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Actually, our incentives were the precise reverse when this data was being put together. These figures first appeared in the \u2018How Rich Are You Calculator\u2019. In that context we took people who <em>knew</em> their income, and told them what percentage of households they were richer than. It would have been in our interests to include the <em>lowest</em> income numbers possible for the richest folks in the world, in order to inflate what global income percentile people stood at.</p>\n<p>That could have been achieved by going with PovcalNet\u2019s numbers the whole way. Had we been lazy we could have done this more easily than what we did do, as these numbers were already public. We could have then claimed that an individual earning $36,500 is richer than 99.85% of the world! But this is quite wrong. PovcalNet is designed to be reliable for lower incomes, as part of the World Bank\u2019s attempt to measure poverty and economic development around the world. It progressively understates the incomes of people at the top of the income distribution as they aren\u2019t well sampled; hence the need for Milanovi\u0107\u2019s alternative numbers for that group.</p>\n<p>GWWC used Milanovi\u0107\u2019s numbers for as much of the distribution as he gave us data for (i.e. it did not exercise discretion about where to switch).</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I was not working at GWWC when the two datasets were combined, so I wouldn\u2019t want to comment on how that was done. Any new chart should document how things like that are performed (and mine will).</p>\n<p>The most material problem as I see it is that PovcalNet and other measures of poverty usually measure <em>consumption</em> (to ensure inclusion of e.g. growing your own food or foraging for free things), while figures for people in developed countries measure <em>income</em> (as that\u2019s what people know and it can be found in on tax records, while most households don\u2019t know their net consumption in any given year).

Furthermore using consumption inflates the income of the poor relative to the rich because it includes things received for free that wouldn\u2019t be included in income measures for people in the developing world.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Nonetheless, I think this does bias the graph towards showing higher inequality. I\u2019m not yet sure how I'll fix this, as I don\u2019t know of reliable figures across the whole distribution that use only one of these measures, or figures of net savings as a percent of income across the income distribution, which could be used to fix the discrepancy.

This is basically a ubiquitous problem, and EA is no exception. From looking into this back in 2013 I understand well where these numbers come from, the parts of the analysis that make me most nervous, and what they can and can't show. But I think it's fair to say that there has existed a risk of derivative works being produced by people dabbling in the topic on a tough schedule, and i) losing the full citation, or ii) accidentally presenting the numbers in a misleading way.</p>\n<p>A classic case of this playing out at the moment is the confusion around GiveWell\u2019s estimated 'cost per life saved' for AMF, vs the new 'cost per life saved equivalent'. GiveWell has tried, but research communication is hard. I feel sorry for people who engage in EA advocacy part time as it's very easy for them to get a detail wrong, or have their facts out of date (snap quiz, how probable is each of these in light of the latest research: deworming impacts i) weight, ii) school attendance, iii) incomes later in life?). This stuff should be corrected, but with love, as folks are usually doing their best, and not everyone can be expected to fully understand or keep up with research in effective altruism.</p>\n<p>One valuable thing about this debate has been that it reminds us that people working on communicating ideas need to speak with the experts who are aware of the details and stress about getting things as accurate as they can be in practice. Ideally one individual should become the point-person who truly understands any complex data source (and gets replaced when staff move on).</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "wDfLRcgdDCLFSixbk", "user": {"username": "Robert_Wiblin"}}, {"_id": "BZjyHkKJ94vjonYdS", "postedAt": "2017-04-12T06:18:16.354Z", "postId": "LaXGf6hZXXqZ7sj5m", "htmlBody": "<p>Here are some other thoughts off the top of my head. As I see it there are different points this figure could be used to support:</p>\n<p>i) The social impact of someone earning, e.g. $100k a year, is potentially quite large, as they are earning more than the global average, making them unusually powerful.</p>\n<p>ii) It's high-impact to help people in the developing world because many people are so very poor.</p>\n<p>iii) This high level of inequality is an indication of a deep injustice in the economic system that needs to be resolved.</p>\n<p>It seems like some folks are particularly worried about the graph being used to support the third point.

Despite outstanding income growth in the middle of the distribution, IIRC the 10th percentile's income hasn't risen much at all. It remains around the minimum subsistence level. With graduate incomes rising in the US, this ratio has probably <em>increased</em> since 2008. Whether this ratio is 30, 100 or 300 is one factor relevant to how good the opportunities look in poverty reduction as a cause relatively to others (what the ratio is and how much that matters is discussed in the_jaded_one's thread). We turn to this ratio later in our career guide, and recently did a fact check on the incomes of GiveDirectly recipients.</p>\n<p>Interestingly, the ratio of a reader\u2019s income to the global median doesn\u2019t seem the best measure for any of these purposes.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "wDfLRcgdDCLFSixbk", "user": {"username": "Robert_Wiblin"}}, {"_id": "KKTnbt5fdS9oMgizQ", "postedAt": "2017-04-15T20:08:16.857Z", "postId": "LaXGf6hZXXqZ7sj5m", "htmlBody": "<p>What are the answers to the snap quiz btw?</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "QX6iCqbAGN2AS8hAZ", "user": {"username": "michaelchen"}}, {"_id": "M2CD4hkrtWMiCHyQe", "postedAt": "2017-04-16T12:40:24.973Z", "postId": "LaXGf6hZXXqZ7sj5m", "htmlBody": "<p>Was this intended as a response to my comment?

This is because it's basically impossible to &quot;sanity check&quot; charts like this without introducing some selection bias. Each step away from the original source compounds this problem. Hugging the source data as tightly as you can and keeping track of the methodology is really the only way to fight this.

Having experts is great, but the point of sharing a chart is to give other people access to the underlyling information in away that's intuitive to interpret. Robin Hanson's <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2016/12/chip-away-at-hard-problems.html\">post</a> on academic vs amateur methods puts the case for this pretty clearly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A key tradeoff in our methods is between ease and directness on the one hand, and robustness and rigor on the other. [...] When you need to make an immediate decision fast, direct easy methods look great. But when many varied people want to share an analysis process over a longer time period, more robust rigorous methods start to look better. Easy direct easy methods tend to be more uncertain and context dependent, and so don\u2019t aggregate as well. Distant others find it harder to understand your claims and reasoning, and to judge their reliability. So distant others tend more to redo such analysis themselves rather than building on your analysis. [...]</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You might think their added freedom would result in amateurs contributing proportionally more to intellectual progress, but in fact they contribute less. Yes, amateurs can and do make more initial progress when new topics arise suddenly far from topics where established expert institutions have specialized. But then over time amateurs blow their lead by focusing less and relying on easier more direct methods. They rely more on informal conversation as analysis method, they prefer personal connections over open competitions in choosing people, and they rely more on a perceived consensus among a smaller group of fellow enthusiasts. As a result, their contributions just don\u2019t appeal as widely or as long.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>GiveWell is a great example of an organization that keeps track of sources so that people who are interested can figure out how they got their numbers.</p>\n<p>(2) It's weird and a little sketchy that there's not a discontinuity around 80%.

I don't think so. I don't imagine it's easy to be the median average Indian, but I expect that you would have a shack, and food, and not freeze to death. </p>\n<p>Also, there is a larger issue here. Being &quot;100 times richer&quot; than someone hides a lot of important assumptions. Let me grant the point that I could survive as a barely-alive hobo for \u00a31.53/day. Well, that existence is not compatible with having a job in the west. There are amounts of money that I have to spend whether I like it or not, if I am to continue to earn any money at all, let alone my current salary. Others have argued that that restriction is irrelevant since it isn't binding, but actually I would quite like the option to live in a really small room in sharing facilities with 4 people if it was 4x cheaper. The option just isn't on the market.  I am looking for accommodation right now, and plenty of people want to sell me 50m^2 for $1000/month with a 3 month penalty clause ($3000!) if I want to leave in less than 3 years, but no-one is selling 12m^2 for $250/month. In fact, the government in my country (western Europe) has passed laws that prevent me from living in a student house (closer to what I want to pay), because I am not a student; they have deliberately split the housing market into two and made people with jobs ineligible for the cheaper half. I would like to pay insurance that only paid out to a maximum of $1000 because that is all my car is worth, but other people on the roads drive $50000 cars and that impacts my premium.  Then there's the social aspect of wealth. If I lived with the same quality of stuff that an Indian person at the 75th percentile of wealth in India lived on, and took a girl back to my shack, she would urgently have something else to do; whereas I can imagine a female from the 50th percentile in pretty much any place being impressed by a male from the 75th percentile. </p>\n<p>With all these things in mind, I would say that I am not 100 times richer than a guy in India earning $700. If I were earning $70,000 <strong>IN INDIA</strong>, I would say it would be closer to the truth (though some of the same problems would apply, especially having to spend money to hold down a white collar job). For starters, I could easily afford a servant or three on that kind of money in India, which paints a picture that is more intuitively commensurate with the factor of 100 that the numbers imply. </p>\n<p>Anyway, thanks for responding, I realize your time is valuable!</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "BKhWCWqgmStFbSvnh", "user": {"username": "the_jaded_one"}}, {"_id": "mq22bbrgYr3cka8hd", "postedAt": "2017-04-26T17:27:42.917Z", "postId": "LaXGf6hZXXqZ7sj5m", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>it would indeed be harder to live in the west on $2/day, because the low-quality goods that the global poor use are not available to buy.

But many of things I mentioned aren't a result of taxes.
