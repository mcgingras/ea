The discount/expected growth rate is very susceptible to this I think, because it's easy to be overconfident and avoid <i>ok</i> bets because of the perceived opportunity cost (especially as your growth rate will go down as your balance goes up and it's harder to find markets that can absorb all your mana, so people are likely to overestimate their long term growth rate)</li><li>On the practical side, every extra setting increases the chance of bugs, and being pretty confident that the answer is correct is important for a calculator that makes important decisions for you</li></ul><p>My current plan is to leave this calculator basically as is, and built another more fully featured one for advanced users, which will hopefully include these things:</p><ul><li>Accounting for several estimates at the same time, and remembering previous bets</li><li>Time discounting (which overlaps with the one above)</li><li>Limit orders, or some other way of automatically buying in/out of a position over time</li><li>Estimating the resolution time in each outcome (this is important if you have a market like \"Will Donald Trump tweet before the end of 2023\", where it can resolve YES early but can't resolve NO early.
