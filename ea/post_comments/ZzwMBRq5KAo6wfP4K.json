Humanity devotes significant resources to managing risk from asteroids, and yet very little into risk from supervolcanic eruptions, despite these being substantially more likely. The absolute numbers are nonetheless low; super-eruptions are expected roughly once every 14,000 years. Interventions proposed by the authors include better monitoring of eruptions, investments in preparedness, and research into geoengineering to mitigate the climatic impacts of large eruptions or (most speculatively) into ways of intervening on volcanoes directly to prevent eruptions.\"</p></blockquote><p>However, their <i>Nature</i> paper is about <strong>magnitude 7</strong> eruptions, which may have a probability this century of <strong>1/6</strong>, not supervolcanic eruptions (magnitude 8), which as you point out have a much lower probability.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I think its a fascinating paper that in a prominent, rigorous and novel way applies importance/neglectedness/tractability to a comparison of two hazards:</p><blockquote><p>\"Over the next century, large-scale volcanic eruptions are hundreds of times more likely to occur than are asteroid and comet impacts, put together. The climatic impact of these events is comparable, yet the response is vastly different. \u2018Planetary defence\u2019 receives hundreds of millions of dollars in funding each year, and has several global agencies devoted to it. [...] By contrast, there is no coordinated action, nor large-scale investment, to mitigate the global effects of large-magnitude eruptions.

I'm being pernickety as I view a key thrust of their research as distinguishing 7 from 8. We can't just group magnitude 7 (1/6 chance) along with magnitude 8 and write them off as a teeny 1/14,000 chance. We need to distinguish 7 from 8, consider their severity/probability seperately, and prioritise them differently.</p>", "parentCommentId": "BTjdvJYvNN2S8JP2G", "user": {"username": "HaydnBelfield"}}]
