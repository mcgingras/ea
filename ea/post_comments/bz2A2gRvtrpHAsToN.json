Thank you for writing it!</p><p>\nI think your estimates for the annual financial cost of having children underestimate the real costs, because they don't account for the time value of money and because they omit opportunity costs.</p><p>To account for the time value of money, we can use the formula used to calculate <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amortization_(business)\">amortization</a> in business.  Assuming a present-value cost of \u00a3175,000, an interest rate of 5% and 50 periods, the annual cost for each couple turns out to be about <b>\u00a34,700</b> per parent per year.</p><p>To account for opportunity costs, we can use Brian Tomasik's <a href=\"http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/cost-of-kids.html#section3\">estimates</a>.  He claims that the present-value opportunity costs of parenting are about $380,000, or \u00a3225,000. Adding this to the financial costs, we get a total cost of \u00a3400,000.  Using the formula above, this translates into about <b>\u00a311,000</b> per parent per year.</p><p>However, as Brian notes in private correspondence, the opportunity costs could be much lower if parents outsource them. And parents persuaded by Bryan Caplan's arguments should be less reluctant to outsource these costs.  So for you and Toby, and for many other EAs, the estimate is probably lower than \u00a311,000.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Pablo_Stafforini2"}}, {"_id": "6RkHmzwMdWR5sHgE3", "postedAt": "2014-04-15T02:29:00.000Z", "postId": "bz2A2gRvtrpHAsToN", "htmlBody": "<p>You could outsource the costs if that's something you're inclined to do.

But the figure of \u00a34700 per couple is not wildly different from \u00a34000 per couple per annum, given the uncertainty bounds I'd put on it. </p><p>Regarding the opportunity costs estimate here I'd dispute that figure with gusto. I think that estimate is inaccurate and probably inflated for two major reasons.</p><p>Firstly, I don't think we have anything like the amount of certainty about that figure - at the very least it deserves some error bars! (Incidentally, I find this is a big problem with back-of-the-envelope calculations that come out with a single figure - the number looks much more authoritative than it should given the uncertainty regarding the factors behind it). </p><p>I was deliberately not specific as to the amount of the time cost involved because I was unable to find reliable data to make such an estimate. Brian's essay does not provide any data from which he draws  his estimate of 21 hours per week per parent in time opportunity costs (I think I am correct in believing he's not a parent). He simply states it after a long list of the types of work that parenting involves.  In his account, the following are 'work':  &quot;playing with your toddler\u2026spending quality time with your kid on the weekends, taking your kid to events and friends' houses, going to school functions\u2026giving advice on jobs, and everything else in between.&quot; I don't dispute that some elements of parenting are straightforwardly work - probably unpleasant and with no immediate reward for the individual performing them. However to describe playing with your child, engaging in social activities or giving interested advice to a young person exploring future career options as 'work' is a little boggling to me. I suspect that for most people who would class these things as work, parenthood is unlikely to be an attractive prospect.</p><p>So I am sceptical of the apparently randomly drawn figure of the hours of work involved. Of course, I'm happy to report back with data on this in a few years.</p><p>Secondly (and this criticism also applies to Brian's figure of 21 hours per parent per week even if it were accurate), I would dispute the assumption that each marginal hour of time can be spent in earning money at the same rate as your basic income.</p><p>Depending on your type of work, It may not be practically possible: In my case, though I can increase my earnings by taking on extra shifts, the number I can take is capped as I am not allowed to exceed a set number of hours of clinical duty per week (averaged over a period of time). In fact, just yesterday a colleague was reprimanded for having taken on locum shifts which meant he exceeded these hours, and he has had to come off the 'on-call' rota (with a concomitant salary cut) to allow the time to average out. For someone in a full-time salaried position (say a university research appointment), it's not the case that working longer hours increases your pay. For most people in this position it's unlikely to be the case that opportunities exist to find an extra 21 hours of paid work per week which will pay them at a professional wage. </p><p>In addition to the practical possibility there's the psychological reality. I don't know many people who can actually consistently and productively do paid work 50+ hours a week. I recall seeing data (on this blog) that suggested those who estimate their working hours much about the mid-40s were a) overestimating and b) no more productive than those who claimed to work fewer hours.  Certainly at a population level an inverse relationship is observed between hours worked and productivity</p><p><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/09/working-hours\">http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2013/09/working-hours</a>.</p><p>So even we did work in careers that would theoretically allow us to increase our working hours by nearly 50 and be paid for it, I think it's highly unlikely we would sustain that working pattern.

However, they <em>are</em> distributed over twenty years of that time and I think the amortization calculator you used assumes it is all paid as a lump sum on year one. I set up a spreadsheet to allocate the costs evenly over the first twenty years and then look for which amount this was equivalent to paying if the costs were spread out over the whole 50 years. This was \u00a33,000 per parent per year, which is higher than the \u00a32,000, but quite a bit less than the \u00a34,700. This is still not perfect as the costs are skewed a bit towards the early and late years, but it should be pretty close to the right model.</p><p>\nI also think that 5% above inflation is substantially higher than the best estimates of the risk adjusted rate of return.

International comparisons give lower returns and are probably more representative of the future (we don't know which country will do best this time round).\n(3) Within-index selection bias. The major indices are of the top stocks rather than a fixed set, so for example if all the stocks in the S&amp;P 500 went to zero tomorrow, this would really change the real rate of return, but wouldn't change the index that much as the next 500 stocks would replace them -- we need to adjust for that.\n(4) Between-exchange selection bias. Even attempts to adjust for the country selection bias by using a range of stock markets or indices in different countries often overestimate returns because failed stock markets typically don't appear in the later data for they have ceased to exist. One needs to carefully adjust for this.</p><p>\nI don't recall the exact real returns when these things are adjusted for and can't quickly find a good estimate, but I seem to recall it comes down to less than 3%.
