I\u2019ll respond below to some specific points, but please let me know if I\u2019m misunderstanding your core argument.</p><p>I agree online conferences are valuable for many of the reasons you outlined and that\u2019s why I\u2019m excited about EAGxVirtual (applications launching soon!). I also agree that deeper, long-lasting connections are important and that our events should try to create them (I think retreats are particularly good at this, for example).</p><p>However, I disagree with some of the takes here:</p><blockquote><p>Moving almost all real-life EA conferences online</p></blockquote><p>At a high-level, <strong>virtual events score lower on \u201clikelihood to recommend\u201d and \u201cnumber of new connections made\u201d than in-person events</strong>. I strongly think they\u2019re still worth doing largely because it\u2019s too costly for many people to attend in-person events.<br><br>Furthermore, I don\u2019t quite see how favouring virtual conferences leads you to recommend cancelling in-person ones - you can have more of both!</p><blockquote><p>\u201cThe connections EAGs generate are <i>almost exclusively online\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>What\u2019s your evidence for this? My sense is that being physically co-located with other EAs is highly valuable, and that many people move to EA hubs for this reason</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;Hence why measuring the <i>number</i> of connections sounds severely misguided to me, especially when you have opportunities to optimise more closely for the correlates of peak friendships.</p></blockquote><p>I would guess that number of connections correlates quite closely with new peak friendships (the more people you meet, the more potential close friends you meet), so I don't think it's misguided.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "OllieBase"}}, {"_id": "yZjMpN7FtRuEfgGyM", "postedAt": "2022-09-06T22:38:57.238Z", "postId": "35nRwEyzCKDfh3dCr", "htmlBody": "<p>After talking a bit with Ruth Grace Wong about it, I admit to having framed this entire thingthink I should just reframe this entire thing. I\u2019m not trying to <i>reduce</i> irl activity. I\u2019m more concerned with the idea that irl EAG(x)s are short, and connections made are largely long-distance. People meet wonderfwl people they\u2019d like to keep in touch with over the weekend, but because they live far apart, it\u2019s hard to maintain the connection.</p><p>As you point out, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/M5GoKkWtBKEGMCFHn/what-s-the-theory-of-change-of-come-to-the-bay-over-the\"><u>moving to a hub</u></a> makes it a lot easier to maintain connections because there\u2019s less stress involved with seeing each other frequently. But realistically, most people aren\u2019t going to move to stay in touch, either because they lack the opportunity or inclination. And even if most people <i>did </i>move, I think there\u2019s still a lot of value to making it easier for people to keep in touch after they fly back to their respective homes from just having met at EAG. I think the virtual aspects of community building have been neglected, and marginal efforts to optimise this can pay manyfold greater dividends. : )</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cI would guess that number of connections correlates quite closely with new peak friendships\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>My best friends have all come about because we\u2019ve shared spaces where we serendipitously see each other frequently (e.g. the Gather Town coworking space we use). Regular contact is <i>really important</i>. I\u2019ve met several people whom I would consider very usefwl to interact frequently with, but because those interactions would have to be scheduled, they rarely reach their potential. I think people maybe underestimate how much of a hassle it can be for most people to keep scheduling things, even if the call itself is very positive. The scheduling aspect just makes it a lot costlier to maintain.</p><p>I\u2019ve had conversation-length interactions with many more high-compatibility EAs than the number of EAs that I\u2019ve shared office space with, yet it\u2019s overwhelmingly the EAs I\u2019ve shared daily interactions with who have ended up important to me (important in the sense that they keep me going and help &amp; inspire me to do good). On Bayes then, this implies that conversation-length first-impressions have very inferior conversion rates to lasting friendships compared to online shared office spaces--even if the latter generates fewer first-pass \"connections\". Hence why the metric itself seems ill-advised when applied to different activities.</p><p>This is part of my reasoning for why I want <strong>EAG(x)s to be </strong><i><strong>specifically optimised</strong></i><strong> as on-ramps for regular meeting-places online</strong> (virtual hubs), like EA Anywhere, mastermind groups, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/groups/e4ijnQ45gevf8Qcck\">EAVR</a>, or especially coworking office spaces like <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/groups/MCtKD7oex9jhsAWvD\"><u>EAGT</u></a> or Complice.</p><p>The latter spaces also serve as places for the community to just hang out online, and attendance is less <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EpMQBmQv7e4yaDYYN/community-building-solely-as-a-tool-for-impact-creates-toxic\"><u>explicitly focused on having impact</u></a>.</p><blockquote><p><i>The sign of having a healthy community is that when people burn out and need to take a break from trying to have impact, they don't also feel the need to take a break from the community. <strong>The community is their refuge.</strong></i></p></blockquote><p>Anne Wissemann (from the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LR2LG8wggLTG5Gjbe/ea-workspace-virtual-co-working-chatroom-for-eas\"><u>EA Workspace</u></a> project in 2015) also talks about how important it is to have spaces to casually bump into each other for the maintenance of friendship:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cMany of us have full schedules and Skype calls to uphold friendships pose a real cost on time and flexibility and can be a pain to arrange. Keeping in touch via the EAW is easy - you\u2019re bound to bump into each every once in a while if you work at similar times. It doesn\u2019t cost you any additional time since you were having a break anyways, and you can make progress on your projects in the meantime. Win-win!\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>The effect both on happiness and akrasia on finding important value-aligned friends in a daily-interacting coworking environment is <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1KsADx-Zh8hqTSXxgi9vUIn44FEwknXifiPGifoAxo_o/viewanalytics\"><u>hard</u></a> to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EYKRYNzdrZ4LH2jma/less-wrong-study-hall-year-1-retrospective#Hedonic_Impact__Hedonic_improvement_in_the_Hall__1_5__1_being_no_negative_impact__5_being_large_impact_\"><u>understate</u></a>, and the solutions are far from saturated with all the people who could benefit from them.</p><p>Btw, I'd be eager to talk about<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zdsii4c8kbXmgzsEkboTrRcSFiiRco6WqeB7IKW4vXI/\"> <u>some plans</u></a> we have to grow the online office/hub thing, and how CEA might be able to help, if you have time and inclination.

And I agree that retreats sound more conducive to friendships than online interactions for most people.</p><p>What I hope for is just that the a virtual hub/coworking office that's always accessible (this could be EAGT, but anything that serves the purpose is fine) is advertised at EAG(x)s as a way to keep in touch with the people you meet. And perhaps that CEA helps advertise the coworking week starting at the 24th to give it some credibility.
