There are no subcultures which average eight children except ones like Quiverfull which have incredible attrition and are also very damaging to the people raised in them. To my knowledge no historical society has averaged eight children. &nbsp;'as long as each of their descendants can commit to having at least eight children for just 11 generations' is not any more plausible than 'as long as we win the lottery at least one Friday every year'. &nbsp;And I think 'planning out biological children for eleven generations' is suggestive of being pretty much incompetent at thinking about the future.
