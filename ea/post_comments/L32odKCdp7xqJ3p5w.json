There's a bunch of (potentially) relevant networks I'm connected into in Leiden, e.g. Amnesty, ISN (International student network), LDU (Leiden Debating Union), EUSA (European Student Association), but in which I have yet not been able to get through the change I should have pushed harder for. For example, I once had the idea to set up a debating tournament as to not only raise awareness, but do so amongst those who would be most open to its message and most able to then do something about it, namely debaters. This particular idea might not be as feasible as I once thought it was, but there's always other opportunities to be thought of. </p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Here are potential network collaborations that we\u2019re exploring right now:\nLocal/student groups \nThese would clearly define their target groups and offer newcomers a path to learn about EA principles and build up their capacity to do good (established groups like EA London and EA Berkeley are inspirations to us here).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Based on having been in a book club with a community of about ~300 individuals, it's really difficult to get a large group of individuals to be consistently involved. It follows that this strategy has a high risk of failing, demotivating those involved in the failure from staying involved in EA. If you want to go ahead with this, it needs to be thought out well. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "DardanBastiaan"}}, {"_id": "tjhnohkcqioj6xBGK", "postedAt": "2017-07-03T22:49:24.783Z", "postId": "L32odKCdp7xqJ3p5w", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for the points!</p>\n<p>First off, you might be interested in helping continue the EA Leiden group (the current organiser has just finished her Masters and is going back to Germany): <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/?_rdr#~!/profile.php?id=100015874785676\">https://www.facebook.com/?_rdr#~!/profile.php?id=100015874785676</a>\nPlease let me know if you want me to connect you with her. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "nu8RF9yZh3ZY2KeaD", "user": {"username": "remmelt"}}, {"_id": "MRhYW8rW2TZetyvwQ", "postedAt": "2017-07-03T23:17:00.816Z", "postId": "L32odKCdp7xqJ3p5w", "htmlBody": "<p>Ah, I totally missed about a chapter having opened this april.

Rather than having a core group hosting activities which very few would attend, I envision having a core group that first raises awareness throughout Leiden and otherwise working pragmatically, which could include hosting events, to further the EA agenda. If some of these people are anything I know them to be, i.e. highly talented, motivated individuals, then we'd be able to stick together based on our shared passion and desire for a stimulating environment alone. The risk of such a group falling apart would in that sense be far smaller than what I had estimated it to be in my previous post. </p>\n<p>Anyway, again, I very much look forward to working more closely with you and those already active in Leiden. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "g8DHAEvwEZtyfmoBC", "user": {"username": "DardanBastiaan"}}, {"_id": "PTeYdwGqh83WeCwJX", "postedAt": "2017-07-04T14:03:03.778Z", "postId": "L32odKCdp7xqJ3p5w", "htmlBody": "<p>Yes, I think connecting with potentially interested people on existing platforms makes sense for local groups, as an example.

Last May, we actually collaborated with a publisher to get a <a href=\"http://www.lemniscaat.nl/Non-fictie/Filosofie/titels/9789047709442/Effectief%20altruisme\">new translated book</a> of Peter Singer out.</p>\n<p>Here's the deal. From my perspective, it will probably take too much time and attention away from EAN to directly work on distributing the books. Our current strategy for representing EA publicly in the Netherlands is to do it in limited, low marginal cost ways \u2013 through our online channels and invitations from media or lecture platforms (this falls under strategy point 4: EA-related in the Netherlands). </p>\n<p>I think we should aim to become extremely competent by specialising in these approaches, which also means not getting distracted by other outreach opportunities (unless focusing on one of those instead will contribute more to building a thriving EA community). </p>\n<p><strong>To explore this concept more deeply:</strong></p>\n<p>People tend to <a href=\"http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/hykKnw1.html\">naturally specialise</a> in economic markets. This seems more difficult in the EA community because in a transaction, a product (information, skills, and other forms of capital) is often not offered in return for currency units (a medium of exchange) but instead in the expectation of reciprocity (that the other party is 1. aligned enough with your consequentialist preferences and 2. capable of fulfilling these moral preferences sufficiently using what you give them). It's not even barter (the exchange of products as would be done in moral trade, i.e. where moral preferences diverge) but the formation of trust-based partnerships towards shared long-term goals.</p>\n<p>My hope (and what we're testing) is that collaborating on building a fractal social network structure \u2013 with EAs clustering around different adaptable network targets with corresponding specialised expertise at each layer \u2013 would result in a more optimal division of labour.</p>\n<p>So should a competent organiser in the Netherlands reach out to us wanting to build an 'EA Literature network', we'd be open to exploring this! </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "vFuN9JmMSdHrTjmcf", "user": {"username": "remmelt"}}]
