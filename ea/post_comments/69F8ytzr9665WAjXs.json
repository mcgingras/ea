Whilst we have a healthy level of reserves currently, they are designed to protect THL UK and its activities in case of an emergency.

And hi Klara, thanks for your answer on behalf of THL UK! I also wanted to chime in from the perspective of THL.&nbsp;</p><p>If THL were to receive more significant additional funding, we have developed a robust&nbsp;<strong>expansion plan for the OWA through 2030</strong>. The goal of this expansion is to free one billion hens from cages by 2030 and achieve a critical tipping point in the OWA\u2019s mission to eliminate battery cages from the planet.&nbsp;Campaigns against global companies have worked well, but to phase out battery cages across the globe, we must have a robust and high-functioning alliance in every major country.&nbsp;</p><p>Our success in building an effective global alliance is outpacing the operational support THL is able to provide, given our own resource constraints. Our current model of having a single regional OWA coordinator to support upwards of 20 member groups with differing needs across an entire continent is no longer sustainable. As the OWA is one of the only international movement building resources available, our constraints mean that groups are unable to get the training and support that they need, alongside the strategic guidance and leadership development. We also see a huge appetite from groups to expand what the OWA is offering so that we can be an even more effective global coalition.&nbsp;</p><p>To achieve the current need and anticipated growth, we need to create small teams in key regions around the world that can then support the differing needs of groups in their respective regions. To scale this up, we estimate this will cost a minimum of $2.5M in 2024, with capacity to increase our OWA grants by an additional $1M, and closer to $8.5M in 2025.</p><p>Another program that is primed for expansion is the&nbsp;<strong>Animal Policy Alliance</strong>\u2014already 14 member groups strong, and we have a goal to reach at least 30 active alliance members by 2025.&nbsp;THL launched the APA in 2022 to organize, unite, and empower local and state-level animal advocacy groups that are involved in issue-based advocacy and implementing legislative strategies for animals with policy agendas that include animals raised for food. These groups harness and channel the grassroots power of a significant base of animal protection advocates in the United States that they then use to create relationships with legislators at the city, state and federal level, and advocate for policies that benefit animals. Over time, through its leadership role in this alliance and through its grant-making capacity, THL will also influence local groups to focus more on farmed animal and food system issues.&nbsp;</p><p>THL could effectively use up to $2M to expand the APA team and provide grants to member organizations in 2024.&nbsp;We distributed $500K in grants in 2022 and were unable to continue the grants program in 2023 due to funding constraints. But through this process, we know the need for funding policy work in the US is strong, and that there are dozens of groups eager to expand their advocacy for farmed animals.</p><p>Both of these alliances have significant room to scale. We have detailed plans to use 2-3x funding for these programs, but we could scale even further and achieve our desired impact more quickly with additional funding.</p><p>For full details of THL\u2019s room for more funding, check out&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/xourt4HttDM5QcHsk/p/gGBtgScdfLxsodhzg\"><u>this post!</u></a></p>", "parentCommentId": "C9ALvsj45sduhYth3", "user": {"username": "carolinemills"}}, {"_id": "CZeaz7wag47GM8cND", "postedAt": "2023-11-17T18:00:29.606Z", "postId": "69F8ytzr9665WAjXs", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you for your question Andrew.&nbsp;</p><p>Our match funders for our end of year appeal also supported our end of year appeal last year with a similar match.
