This is partly because I've learned more, but partly because I think SIAI/MIRI has gotten better at communicating.  In the past I thought the language was silly and anthropomorphic, with terms like &quot;friendly&quot; and &quot;unfriendly&quot;, so the scenarios didn't strike me as plausible.  Even if AI writers were trying to convey reasonable ideas, the language was offputting for a superficial reader.  I hope MIRI will continue to use clear, objective language and cut back on jargon and jokes.  </p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Lila"}}]
