Meanwhile, I have gotten confused about the overall impact of a plant-based diet, given the uncertain effects on wild animals and in the longterm. I think I continue plant-based because (descending order of importance):</p><ul><li>It feels intuitively wrong to be responsible for some visible torture based on unclear overall effects which are quite uncertain.<ul><li>I think I should feel fine about doing something with overall unclear effects even if the most visible effects are bad.&nbsp;</li><li>However, I do not, and I suppose it makes sense to avoid conflicts with intuitions to some extent. For example, if in theory eating animals was super good overall, and I could not internalise that, still feeling bad about contributing to factory-farming, it is possible the overall best option for me would be continuing not to eat animals, such that I could remain productive working on other matters.</li></ul></li><li>I believe a plant-based diet is healthier, and can extend my life for a few years. Since I think my work is positive, having the chance to do more of it is good!</li><li>I no longer like the taste of animals. Switching at this point would be hard, especially given the above.</li><li>I think a plant-based diet is more practical (e.g. generally involves less cooking time, and less cleaning due to less fat). There would typically be factors contributing to it being less practical, but I do not think those affect me much. For example, for (rare) family meals in restaurants, I am fine with just eating soup, rice and lettuce, or whatever is available.</li></ul>", "parentCommentId": "jitC4Y9amnzdAeAb4", "user": {"username": "vascoamaralgrilo"}}, {"_id": "zzv2aX7RxvxyJrmqX", "postedAt": "2023-03-14T14:22:53.517Z", "postId": "DJTpSNbNfCqKzc7ja", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks, Vasco.
