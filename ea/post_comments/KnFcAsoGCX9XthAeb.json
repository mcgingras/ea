I participated in Toastmasters for a few years in my career and got a lot out of it. Public speaking is hard and getting practice in a low stakes setting was hugely beneficial for me. This allow you to get great feedback from other experienced presenters, and also helps desensitize yourself to the potential feelings of anxiety that can come from public speaking. I plan to be joining a few sessions and giving a talk myself!&nbsp;</p><p>When is the next event and how do I sign up?</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Adam Tury"}}, {"_id": "DtsWTHtL65Y3nTrAw", "postedAt": "2023-10-06T14:15:02.999Z", "postId": "KnFcAsoGCX9XthAeb", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks and likewise, got and continue to get a lot out of Toastmasters, and trying to extend that benefit to EA community, especially those who can't get to a local club in person.
