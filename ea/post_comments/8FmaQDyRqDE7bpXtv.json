My favorite example is <a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/\">Charity Entrepreneurship</a>, and their <a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/our-charities\">incubated charities</a>. They are doing really amazing stuff and are saving thousands of lives, I don't see them (and all their 20 charities) going away any time soon.</p><blockquote><p>I am literally an economist and I am sorry to report that this is the way of the world.
