That said, I agree with the general point that effective altruists probably should spend more time convincing others to join the EA movement.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Stefan_Schubert"}}, {"_id": "wTCrgW8tueuyYCXX6", "postedAt": "2014-09-11T09:04:17.247Z", "postId": "Tu4S9prsSi5teeWJe", "htmlBody": "<p>So am I right to think that the point of the haste consideration is that there is a &quot;return on investment&quot; on doing good? Many good things you do will in turn cause other good things to happen and so good things done further in the past will have had more time to do good through indirect effects. If so, it would seem that it would be really important to think about what good things actually have these indirect effects. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "MarkusAnderljung"}}]
