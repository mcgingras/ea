They work great in some specific applications. Newer UV-C technology is a marginal improvement, but doesn't significantly address the cost, design expertise, and maintenance challenges that have kept UV systems from widespread use. Air filters are generally better for most applications. I do expect we will see more UV-C systems in particular applications, but it is far from the one-technology-to-rule-them-all solution that the EA community seems to think it is. This follows a historic pattern of the EA community generally over-hyping singular technology solutions to major problems in other cause areas, probably because of the techno-optimist worldview that many EAs have.</p>\n<p>See ASHRAE's guidance on filtration and air cleaning technologies for more details and comparisons:\n<a href=\"https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/filtration-disinfection\">https://www.ashrae.org/technical-resources/filtration-disinfection</a></p>\n", "parentCommentId": "ML4qCGzCmHXNgHBXs", "user": {"username": "MatthewDahlhausen"}}, {"_id": "PnCteFgkomQamYzgG", "postedAt": "2023-05-23T22:36:04.937Z", "postId": "DLuiEPoAhgBhuHKi7", "htmlBody": "<p>Could you elaborate on what you consider to be the specific marginal improvements of newer UV-C technologies?</p>", "parentCommentId": "CnPQXmnyHJmtqu5Yn", "user": {"username": "vbelenky"}}, {"_id": "KnzpoJsbtGbmQETnB", "postedAt": "2023-05-24T15:08:07.673Z", "postId": "DLuiEPoAhgBhuHKi7", "htmlBody": "<p>Possibly cheaper, and less ozone production.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "PnCteFgkomQamYzgG", "user": {"username": "MatthewDahlhausen"}}, {"_id": "iw6H25zzRSpnx9evX", "postedAt": "2023-08-24T21:08:38.185Z", "postId": "DLuiEPoAhgBhuHKi7", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Matt - Have you had any experience with testing based on the ECA or ECAi metrics outlined in 241?
