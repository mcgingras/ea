In general, I think the field of computer security has lots of good examples of adversarial setups in which the party that can throw the most intelligence at a problem wins.</p><p>Probably not central to your main points, but on this:</p><blockquote><p>If we assume no&nbsp;<i>qualitative capability leaps</i> from a regular human to a skilled human hacker, then we can say something like \u2018X humans with regular hacking capability will be able to replace one skilled human hacker\u2019. The effect of this on the attack workload is to&nbsp;<i>increase it</i> - i.e, we\u2019d need a&nbsp;<i>more capable system (</i>higher N,V, lower F<i>)&nbsp;</i>to execute the attack in the same calendar time.<strong> By ignoring the&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>skilled hacker v.s regular human</strong></i><strong> distinction, the analysis here considers a worst case scenario world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p></blockquote><p>I think there's at least one thing you're overlooking: there is a <i>lot</i> of variance in human labor, and hiring well to end up on the right side of that variance is really hard. 10x engineers are real, and so are 0x and -5x engineers and -50x managers, and if you're not careful when building your team, you'll end up paying for 10,000 \"skilled\" labor hours which don't actually accomplish much.&nbsp;<br><br>An AI comprised of a bunch of subagents might have vaguely similar problems if you squint, but my guess is that the ability to hire and fire relatively instantaneously, clone your most productive workers, etc. makes a pretty big difference. At the very least, the variance is probably much lower.<br><br>Another reason that I suspect 10,000 labor hours is on the high end for humans: practical offensive cybersecurity isn't exactly the most prestigious career track. My guess is that the most cognitively-demanding offensive cybersecurity work &nbsp;is currently done in academia and goes into producing research papers and proofs-of-concept. Among humans, the money, prestige, and lifestyle offered by a career with a government agency or a criminal enterprise just can't compete with the other options available in academia and industry to the best and brightest minds.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Max H"}}, {"_id": "zD489tiYHg2nmvR7s", "postedAt": "2023-10-04T10:15:20.953Z", "postId": "bhrKwJE7Ggv7AFM7C", "htmlBody": "<p>Yep, the variance of human worker teams should definitely be stressed.
