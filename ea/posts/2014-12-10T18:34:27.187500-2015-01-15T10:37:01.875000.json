Something like \u201cYes, the feeling of constantly being outraged and mired in the latest controversy is unpleasant. And yes, it would be nice to get to avoid it and spend time with your family and look at kitten pics or something. But when the controversy is about people being murdered in cold blood, or living in fear, or something like that \u2013 then it\u2019s your duty as a decent human being to care. In the best case scenario you\u2019ll discharge that duty by organizing widespread protests or something \u2013 but the <em>absolute least</em> you can do is reblog a couple of slogans.\u201d</p>\n<p>I think Cliff Pervocracy is trying to say something similar in <a href=\"http://pervocracy.tumblr.com/post/104260760964/politics-that-feel-good\">this post</a>. Key excerpt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>When you\u2019ve grown up with messages that you\u2019re incompetent to make your own decisions, that you don\u2019t deserve any of the things you have, and that you\u2019ll never be good enough, the [conservative] fantasy of rugged individualism starts looking pretty damn good.</p>\n<p>Intellectually, I think my current political milieu of feminism/progressivism/social justice is more correct, far better for the world in general, and more helpful to me since I don\u2019t actually live in a perfectly isolated cabin.</p>\n<p>But god, it\u2019s uncomfortable. It\u2019s intentionally uncomfortable\u2014it\u2019s all about getting angry at injustice and questioning the rightness of your own actions and being sad so many people still live such painful lives. Instead of looking at your cabin and declaring \u201cI shall name it\u2026CLIFFORDSON MANOR,\u201d you need to look at your cabin and recognize that a long series of brutal injustices are responsible for the fact that you have a white-collar job that lets you buy a big useless house in the woods while the original owners of the land have been murdered or forced off it.</p>\n<p>And you\u2019re never good enough. You can be good\u2014certainly you get major points for charity and activism and fighting the good fight\u2014but not good enough. No matter what you do, you\u2019re still participating in plenty of corrupt systems that enforce oppression. Short of bringing about a total revolution of everything, your work will never be done, you\u2019ll never be good enough.</p>\n<p>Once again, to be clear, I don\u2019t think this is wrong. I just think it\u2019s a bummer.</p>\n<p>I don\u2019t know of a solution to this. (Bummer again.) I don\u2019t think progressivism can ever compete with the cozy self-satisfaction of the cabin fantasy. I don\u2019t think it should. Change is necessary in the world, people don\u2019t change if they\u2019re totally happy and comfortable, therefore discomfort is necessary.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019d like to make what I hope is a friendly amendment to Cliff\u2019s post. He thinks he\u2019s talking about progressivism versus conservativism, but he isn\u2019t. A conservative happy with his little cabin and occasional hunting excursions, and a progressive happy with her little SoHo flat and occasional poetry slams, are psychologically pretty similar. So are a liberal who abandons a cushy life to work as a community organizer in the inner city and fight poverty, and a conservative who abandons a cushy life to serve as an infantryman in Afghanistan to fight terrorism. The distinction Cliff is trying to get at here isn\u2019t left-right. It\u2019s activist versus passivist.</p>\n<p>As part of a movement <a href=\"https://pdf.yt/d/-jQQX6XY9dU0LN4G\">recently deemed postpolitical</a>, I have to admit I fall more on the passivist side of the spectrum \u2013 at least this particular conception of it. I talk about politics when they interest me or when I enjoy doing so, and I feel an obligation not to actively make things worse. But I don\u2019t feel like I need to talk nonstop about whatever the designated Issue is until it distresses me and my readers both.</p>\n<p>I\u2019ve heard people give lots of reasons for not wanting to get into politics. For some, hearing about all the evils of the world makes them want to curl into a ball and cry for hours. Still others feel deep personal guilt about anything they hear \u2013 an almost psychotic belief that if people are being hurt anywhere in the world, it\u2019s their fault for not preventing it. A few are chronically uncertain about which side to take and worried that anything they do will cause more harm than good. A couple have traumatic experiences that make them leery of affiliating with a particular side \u2013 did you know the prosecutor in the Ferguson case was the son of a police officer who was killed by a black suspect? And still others are perfectly innocent and just want to reblog kitten pictures.</p>\n<p>Pervocracy admits this, and puts it better than I do:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But god, it\u2019s uncomfortable. It\u2019s intentionally uncomfortable\u2014it\u2019s all about getting angry at injustice and questioning the rightness of your own actions and being sad so many people still live such painful lives. Instead of looking at your cabin and declaring \u201cI shall name it\u2026CLIFFORDSON MANOR,\u201d you need to look at your cabin and recognize that a long series of brutal injustices are responsible for the fact that you have a white-collar job that lets you buy a big useless house in the woods while the original owners of the land have been murdered or forced off it. And you\u2019re never good enough. You can be good\u2014certainly you get major points for charity and activism and fighting the good fight\u2014but not good enough. No matter what you do, you\u2019re still participating in plenty of corrupt systems that enforce oppression. Short of bringing about a total revolution of everything, your work will never be done, you\u2019ll never be good enough.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That seems about right. Pervocracy ends up with discomfort, and I\u2019m in about the same place. But other, less stable people end up with self-loathing. Still other people go further than that, into Calvinist-style \u201cperhaps I am a despicable worm unworthy of existence\u201d. <a href=\"http://moteinthedark.tumblr.com/post/104382718166/politics-that-feel-good\">moteinthedark\u2019s reply to Pervocracy</a> gives me the impression that she struggles with this sometime. For these people, abstaining from politics is the only coping tool they have.</p>\n<p>But the counterargument is <em>still</em> that you\u2019ve got a lot of chutzpah playing that card when people in Peshawar or Ferguson or Iraq don\u2019t have access to this coping tool. You can\u2019t just bring in a doctor\u2019s note and say \u201cAs per my psychiatrist, I have a mental health issue and am excused from experiencing concern for the less fortunate.\u201d</p>\n<p>One option is to deny the obligation. I am super sympathetic to this one. The <em>marginal</em> cost of my existence on the poor and suffering of the world is zero. In fact, it\u2019s probably positive. My economic activity consists mostly of treating patients, buying products, and paying taxes. The first treats the poor\u2019s illnesses, the second creates jobs, and the third pays for government assistance programs. Exactly what am I supposed to be apologizing for here? I may benefit from the genocide of the Indians in that I live on land that was formerly Indian-occupied. But I also benefit from the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs, in that I live on land that was formerly dinosaur-occupied. I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m complicit in the asteroid strike; why should I feel complicit in the genocide?</p>\n<p>I have no objection to people who say this. The problem with it isn\u2019t philosophical, it\u2019s emotional. For <em>most people</em> it won\u2019t be enough. The old saying goes \u201cyou can\u2019t reason yourself out of something you didn\u2019t reason yourself into to begin with\u201d, and the idea that secure and prosperous people need to \u201cgive something back\u201d is a lot older than accusations of \u201cbeing complicit in structures of oppression\u201d. It\u2019s probably older than the Bible. People feel a deep-seated need to show that they understand how lucky they are and help those less fortunate than themselves.</p>\n<p>So what do we do with the argument that we are morally obligated to be political activists, possibly by reblogging everything about Ferguson that crosses our news feed?</p>\n<h3>II.</h3>\n<p>We ask: <em>why the heck are we privileging that particular subsection of the category \u201cimproving the world\u201d?</em></p>\n<p>Pervocracy says that \u201cshort of bringing about a total revolution of everything, your work will never be done, you\u2019ll never be good enough.\u201d But he is overly optimistic. Has your total revolution of everything eliminated ischaemic heart disease? Cured malaria? Kept elderly people out of nursing homes? No? Then you haven\u2019t discharged your <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/10/infinite-debt/\">infinite debt</a> yet!</p>\n<p>Being a perfect person doesn\u2019t just mean participating in every hashtag campaign you hear about. It means spending all your time at soup kitchens, becoming vegan, donating everything you have to charity, calling your grandmother up every week, and marrying Third World refugees who need visas rather than your one true love.</p>\n<p>And not all of these things are equally important.</p>\n<p>Five million people participated in the #BlackLivesMatter Twitter campaign. Suppose that solely as a result of this campaign, no currently-serving police officer ever harms an unarmed black person ever again. That\u2019s 100 lives saved per year times let\u2019s say twenty years left in the average officer\u2019s career, for a total of 2000 lives saved, or 1/2500th of a life saved per campaign participant. By coincidence, 1/2500th of a life saved happens to be what you get when you donate $1 to the Against Malaria Foundation. The round-trip bus fare people used to make it to their #BlackLivesMatter protests could have saved ten times as many black lives as the protests themselves, <em>even given completely ridiculous overestimates of the protests\u2019 efficacy</em>.</p>\n<p>The moral of the story is that if you feel an obligation to give back to the world, participating in activist politics is one of the worst possible ways to do it. Giving even a tiny amount of money to charity is hundreds or even thousands of times more effective than almost any political action you can take. Even if you\u2019re absolutely convinced a certain political issue is the most important thing in the world, you\u2019ll effect more change by donating money to nonprofits lobbying about it than you will be reblogging anything.</p>\n<p>There is <em>no reason</em> that politics would even <em>come to the attention</em> of an unbiased person trying to \u201cbreak out of their bubble of privilege\u201d or \u201chelp people who are afraid of going outside of their house\u201d. Anybody saying that people who want to do good need to spread their political cause is about as credible as a televangelist saying that people who want to do good need to give them money to buy a new headquarters. It\u2019s possible that televangelists having beautiful headquarters might be <em>slightly</em> better than them having hideous headquarters, but it\u2019s not the first thing a reasonable person trying to improve the world would think of.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/blog_images/sschits.png\" alt=\"Graph showing average number of hits for posts on this blog, by topic\"></p>\n<p><em>Average number of hits for posts on this blog, by topic</em></p>\n<p>Nobody cares about charity. Everybody cares about politics, especially race and gender. Just as televangelists who are obsessed with moving to a sweeter pad may come to think that donating to their building fund is the one true test of a decent human being, so our universal obsession with politics, race, and gender incites people to make convincing arguments that taking and spreading the right position on those issues is the one true test of a decent human being.</p>\n<p>So now we have an angle of attack against our original question. \u201cAm I a bad person for not caring more about politics?\u201d Well, every other way of doing good, especially charity, is more important than politics. So this question is strictly superseded by \u201cAm I a bad person for not engaging in every other way of doing good, especially charity?\u201d And then once we answer that, we can ask \u201cAlso, however much sin I have for not engaging in charity, should we add another mass of sin, about 1% as large, for my additional failure to engage in politics?\u201d</p>\n<p>And Cliff Pervocracy\u2019s concern of \u201cEven if I do a lot of politics, am I still a bad person for not doing <em>all</em> the politics?\u201d is superseded by \u201cEven if I give a lot of charity, am I a bad person for not doing <em>all</em> the charity? And then a bad person in an additional way, about 1% as large, for not doing all the politics as well?\u201d</p>\n<p>There\u2019s no good answer to this question. If you want to feel anxiety and self-loathing for not giving 100% of your income, minus living expenses, to charity, then no one can stop you.</p>\n<p>I, on the other hand, would prefer to call that \u201cnot being perfect\u201d. I would prefer to say that if you feel like you will live in anxiety and self-loathing until you have given a certain amount of money to charity, you should make that certain amount ten percent.</p>\n<p>Why ten percent?</p>\n<p>It\u2019s ten percent because that\u2019s the standard decreed by <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a> and the effective altruist community. Why should we believe their standard? I think we should believe it because if we reject it in favor of \u201cNo, you are a bad person unless you give <em>all</em> of it,\u201d then everyone will just sit around feeling very guilty and doing nothing. But if we very clearly say \u201cYou have discharged your moral duty if you give ten percent or more,\u201d then many people will give ten percent or more. The most important thing is having a Schelling point, and ten percent is nice, round, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tithe\">divinely ordained</a>, and \u2013 crucially \u2013 the Schelling point upon which we have already settled. It is an <em>active</em> Schelling point. If you give ten percent, you can have your name on a nice list and get access to a secret forum on the Giving What We Can site which is actually pretty boring.</p>\n<p>It\u2019s ten percent because <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories/\">definitions were made for Man, not Man for definitions</a>, and if we define \u201cgood person\u201d in a way such that everyone is sitting around miserable because they can\u2019t reach an unobtainable standard, we are stupid definition-makers. If we are smart definition-makers, we will define it in whichever way which makes it the most effective tool to convince people to give at least that much.</p>\n<p>Finally, it\u2019s ten percent because if you believe in <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/05/16/you-kant-dismiss-universalizability/\">something like universalizability</a> as a foundation for morality, a world in which everybody gives ten percent of their income to charity is a world where about <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-17512040\">seven trillion dollars</a> go to charity a year. Solving global poverty forever is estimated to cost about $100 billion a year for the couple-decade length of the project. That\u2019s <em>about two percent</em> of the money that would suddenly become available. If charity got seven trillion dollars a year, <em>the first year</em> would give us enough to solve global poverty, eliminate all treatable diseases, fund research into the untreatable ones for approximately the next forever, educate anybody who needs educating, feed anybody who needs feeding, fund an unparalleled renaissance in the arts, permamently save every rainforest in the world, and have enough left over to launch five or six different manned missions to Mars. That would be the <em>first year</em>. Goodness only knows what would happen in Year 2.</p>\n<p>(by contrast, if everybody in the world retweeted the latest hashtag campaign, Twitter would break.)</p>\n<p>Charity is in some sense the perfect unincentivized action. If you think the most important thing to do is to cure malaria, then a charitable donation is deliberately throwing the power of your brain and muscle behind the cause of curing malaria. If, <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/\">as I\u2019ve argued</a>, the reason we can\u2019t solve world poverty and disease and so on is the capture of our financial resources by the undirected dance of incentives, then what better way to fight back than by saying \u201cThanks but no thanks, I\u2019m taking this abstract representation of my resources and using it <em>exactly</em> how I think it should most be used\u201d?</p>\n<p>If you give 10% per year, you have done your part in making that world a reality. You can honestly say \u201cWell, it\u2019s not my fault that everyone <em>else</em> is still dragging their feet.\u201d</p>\n<h3>III.</h3>\n<p>Once the level is fixed at ten percent, we get a better idea how to answer the original question: \u201cIf I want to be a good person who gives back to the community, but I am triggered by politics, what do I do?\u201d You do good in a way that doesn\u2019t trigger you. Another good thing about having less than 100% obligation is that it gives you the opportunity to budget and trade-off. If you make $30,000 and you accept 10% as a good standard you want to live up to, you can either donate $3000 to charity, or participate in political protests until your number of lives or dollars or DALYs saved is equivalent to that.</p>\n<p>Nobody is perfect. This gives us license not to be perfect either. Instead of aiming for an impossible goal, falling short, and not doing anything at all, we set an arbitrary but achievable goal designed to encourage the most people to do as much as possible. That goal is ten percent.</p>\n<p>Everything is commensurable. This gives us license to determine exactly how we fulfill that ten percent goal. Some people are triggered and terrified by politics. Other people are too sick to volunteer. Still others are poor and cannot give very much money. But money is a constant reminder that everything goes into the same pot, and that you can fulfill obligations in multiple equivalent ways. Some people will not be able to give ten percent of their income without excessive misery, but I bet thinking about their contribution in terms of a fungible good will help them decide how much volunteering or activism they need to reach the equivalent.</p>\n<p>Cliff Pervocracy says \u201cYour work will never be done, you\u2019ll never be good enough.\u201d This seems like a recipe for \u2013 at best \u2013 undirected misery, stewing in self-loathing, and total defenselessness against the first <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/17/the-toxoplasma-of-rage/\">parasitic meme</a> to come along and tell them to engage in the latest conflict or else they\u2019re trash. At worst, it autocatalyzes an opposition of egoists who laugh at the idea of helping others.</p>\n<p>On the other hand, Jesus says \u201cTake my yoke upon you\u2026and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy and my burden is light.\u201d This seems like a recipe for getting people to say \u201cOkay, I\u2019ll take your yoke upon me! Thanks for the offer!\u201d</p>\n<p>Persian poet Omar Khayyam, considering the conflict between the strict laws of Islam and his own desire to enjoy life, settles upon the following rule:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Heed not the Sunna, nor the law divine;<br>\nIf to the poor their portion you assign,<br>\nAnd never injure one, nor yet abuse,<br>\nI guarantee you heaven, as well as wine!</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I\u2019m not saying that donating 10% of your money to charity makes you a great person who is therefore freed of every other moral obligation. I\u2019m not saying that anyone who chooses not to do it is therefore a bad person. I\u2019m just saying that if you feel a need to discharge some feeling of a moral demand upon you to help others, and you want to do it intelligently, it beats most of the alternatives.</p>\n<p>This month is the <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/lek/giving_what_we_can_new_year_drive/\">membership drive</a> for <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a>, the organization of people who have promised to give 10% of their earnings to charity. I am a member. Ozy is an aspiring member who plans to join once they are making a salary. Many of the commenters here are members \u2013 I recognize for example Taymon Beal\u2019s name on their list.

But how did I end up here? Because of my race and gender people were more likely to see me as a potential engineer and take my efforts seriously. Because my parents could afford a computer in the 1980s there was one around for me to learn on. Because they could afford good schooling for me there were classes where I could practice this skill and study the theory behind it. It&apos;s hard to know the chain of causality that led to me getting into programming, but it&apos;s substantially less likely that I&apos;d be here if I&apos;d not had these advantages along the way.</p>\n<p>If you think of privilege as something you have that makes you a bad person, if you know the word and know it applies to you but you try to hide and dismiss your privilege, to find axes along which you have less of it, that&apos;s only marginally more helpful than if you were to deny your privilege entirely and insist that all your accomplishments in life have been due to your efforts alone. Having privilege puts you in position where you have an outsized ability to effect change. The best response to privilege is to turn it to fixing the situation that led you to having these major advantages over others.</p>\n<p>If I look at my situation, my race, class, and gender privilege have been helpful, but my nationality privilege is by far my biggest unearned advantage. Someone at the poverty line in the US earns more than 90% of people in the world, even after adjusting for money going farther in poorer countries. This is not to minimize the suffering of people in the US, along any dimension, but to illustrate the extent of the problem and the work required. With so much need, how could I possibly justify keeping my luck to myself?</p>\n<p>So I earn to give. I can&apos;t reject my privilege, I can&apos;t give it back, the best I can do is use it to give back.</p>\n<p><small><em>I also posted this <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/the-privilege-of-earning-to-give\">on my blog</a>.</em></small></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Jeff_Kaufman"}}, {"_id": "qeQgpMjr9oN6oznWr", "title": "Risky Giving", "postedAt": "2015-01-13T15:54:38.076Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><em>A post by Theron Pummer, <a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2015/01/risky-giving/\">cross-posted from the Practical Ethics blog</a> at his request.</em></p>\n<div><!-- article-content -->\n<p>I highly recommend Leif Wenar&#x2019;s essay &#x201C;<a href=\"http://wenar.info/WenarPovertyNoPond8-09.pdf\">Poverty Is No Pond</a>&#x201D; &#x2013; especially to those not yet familiar with, but interested in, the empirical complexities involved in giving to overseas poverty-fighting charities.&#xA0; Wenar&#x2019;s main aim in his essay is to criticize Peter Singer&#x2019;s 2009 book <em><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Life-You-Can-Save/dp/0812981561\">The Life You Can Save</a></em> for (i) being overly optimistic about the quality of information available on the effects of giving to various charities, and (ii) failing to emphasize that every charitable donation also comes with some risk of harming people living in extreme poverty.&#xA0; I&#x2019;ll only briefly address (i), and then turn to and focus primarily on (ii).</p>\n<p>(i)&#xA0; Wenar raises a number of very good points about the difficulties of assessing the effectiveness of government and NGO (non-governmental organization) aid directed toward people living in extreme poverty.&#xA0; He does not confine himself to a single type of aid, e.g. development or humanitarian aid, but calls our attention to important challenges facing a wide range of aid categories.&#xA0; I do think, however, that it is reasonable to be optimistic about the quality of information available on many health interventions, particularly the ones studied in detail by the <a href=\"http://www.dcp-3.org/\">Disease Control Priorities Project</a> and the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/en/\">World Health Organization</a>.&#xA0; Wenar would probably also be pleased by how far <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a> has developed in the five years since he wrote his essay, and by the convergence between them and <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a> on the tremendous cost-effectiveness of deworming and providing malaria nets (both charity evaluators very highly rank <a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/Default.aspx\">Against Malaria Foundation</a>, <a href=\"http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/schisto\">Schistosomiasis Control Initiative</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.evidenceaction.org/#deworm-the-world\">Deworm the World</a>).&#xA0; Wenar is right that it is difficult to know how much it costs to save a life by donating to, e.g. Against Malaria Foundation, because there is uncertainty about what would have happened had the donation not been made.&#xA0; But charity evaluators like those mentioned above take counterfactuals and uncertainty into account and would agree that we can at best provide rough ranges rather than exact figures, for how much it costs to save a life.&#xA0; Wenar writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#x201C;There are presently few paths or incentives for NGOs to translate academic studies into changed behavior. &#xA0;External audits on aid NGOs cover only the basics of financial probity, without touching on the results of the NGOs&#x2019; projects.&#x201D;&#xA0; (p. 20)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But this doesn&#x2019;t accurately reflect, for example, the <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/process\">in-depth process</a> that GiveWell uses in evaluating charities.&#xA0; Moreover, now there is a new breed of NGOs that are very focused on transparency and accountability; in addition to Against Malaria Foundation and Deworm the World, consider <a href=\"https://www.givedirectly.org/\">GiveDirectly</a> and <a href=\"http://possiblehealth.org/\">Possible</a> (there are still several others).&#xA0; Because of <a href=\"https://centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\">effective altruist</a> organizations like GiveWell, Giving What We Can, and <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/\">The Life You Can Save (Singer&#x2019;s book spawned an organization)</a>, these NGOs do have an incentive to continue down this path, and others to follow their lead.&#xA0; (As one example, endorsements from these charity evaluators feature prominently on <a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/Users/tgpum_000/Desktop/againstmalaria.com\">the Against Malaria Foundation website</a>.)</p>\n<p>(ii)&#xA0; I find Wenar&#x2019;s criticism that Singer&#x2019;s framework does not take account of risk of harming others to be the most philosophically interesting aspect of his essay.&#xA0; I&#x2019;ll briefly remind the reader of Singer&#x2019;s general framework, and then present and discuss Wenar&#x2019;s criticism.&#xA0; In <a href=\"http://philosophyfaculty.ucsd.edu/faculty/rarneson/Singeressayspring1972.pdf\">his 1972 article</a>, Singer offered the following principle:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#x201C;If it is in our power to prevent something bad from happening, without thereby sacrificing anything morally significant, we ought, morally, to do it.&#x201D;&#xA0; (p. 231)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>He then gave the famous pond example, eliciting a powerful and widely shared intuition that plausibly supports the above principle:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#x201C;[I]f I am walking past a shallow pond and see a child drowning in it, I ought to wade in and pull the child out. &#xA0;This will mean getting my clothes muddy, but this is insignificant, while the death of the child would presumably be a very bad thing.&#x201D;&#xA0; (p. 231)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Finally, Singer noted that poverty-related death and suffering are bad things, and that we can prevent them from happening without sacrificing anything morally significant by donating to effective aid agencies.&#xA0; The conclusion is that we ought, morally, to donate to effective aid agencies.</p>\n<p>Wenar&#x2019;s criticism of this Singer framework is that (Wenar claims) it doesn&#x2019;t take into account the fact that our donations invariably come with a risk of harm to others, particularly those living in extreme poverty. &#xA0;He writes:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#x201C;Singer&#x2019;s principle does not capture the correct factual relationship between affluent and poor individuals. &#xA0;So this principle does not capture the moral relationship between them, and it cannot ground a call to action. &#xA0;You are not in a situation analogous to knowing that you can save a child drowning in a shallow pond. &#xA0;Closer is this: &#xA0;if you hand cash to a stranger he may &#x2013; along with other strangers hired by other people &#x2013; try to save some children who have fallen into a lake. &#xA0;Yet it looks like these strangers can only get to the lake by pushing through a crowded rave on a pier with no railings.&#x201D;&#xA0; (pp. 25-6)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Wenar thinks Singer&#x2019;s principle doesn&#x2019;t apply to our situation, because our situation involves risk of harm to others, and (Wenar claims) Singer&#x2019;s principle,</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#x201C;&#x2026;draws attention to only one kind of negative effect of our contributing to aid: &#xA0;that we ourselves may &#x2018;sacrifice&#x2019; &#x2013; that we ourselves may have less disposable money or time.&#x201D;&#xA0; (p. 24)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>But (as Wenar himself acknowledges in footnote 46 of his essay) Singer intends for &#x201C;sacrifice&#x201D; to be understood more broadly than this, such that his principle would not imply that you ought to prevent bad when this would mean violating a deontological constraint (e.g. against harming, stealing, lying, promise-breaking, and so on).&#xA0; I think it&#x2019;s clear that this has been Singer&#x2019;s intention in all of his writings making use of this principle.&#xA0; Still, Wenar is right that Singer did not explicitly draw attention to risk of harm to people living in extreme poverty as a possible clash with deontological constraints.&#xA0; And Wenar is right that in the pond example there&#x2019;s no mention of risk of harm, whereas we donors live in the real, risk-filled world.</p>\n<p>In response to Wenar, one could point out, <a href=\"http://www.jstor.org/stable/full/10.1086/663583\">as Nick Beckstead does</a>, that:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#x201C;While it is plausible that some aid involves [deontologically prohibited] harms (e.g., aid to regions that are overrun by corrupt warlords), other cases seem less worrisome, for example, providing technical assistance to a deworming program in India. &#xA0;Admittedly, providing such assistance may divert employment from the private sector, produce bad incentives, or partly replace government effort, and hence weighing these losses against the gains produced by the program might require some cost-benefit analysis and thinking about how to aggregate harms and benefits. &#xA0;However, implementing the program does not seem to involve any tragic violations of rights or have any other worrisome deontological features.&#x201D;&#xA0; (p. 416)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>So in cases of giving to charities that would impose only these kinds of &#x201C;economic harms&#x201D; for the sake of big health benefits, Singer&#x2019;s principle would indeed ground a call to action &#x2013; that is, if imposing such harms for the sake of providing such benefits isn&#x2019;t in fact prohibited by a plausible constraint against harming.</p>\n<p>I am sympathetic to Beckstead&#x2019;s style of response, and would like to say a bit more to extend it.&#xA0; In particular, notice that the <em>size</em> of the risk of any significant harm of giving to a deworming charity &#x2013; or for that matter any of <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">GiveWell&#x2019;s top-ranked charities</a> &#x2013; seems fairly small.&#xA0; The following position seems to me sensible:&#xA0; one would be in violation of no plausible deontological constraint if one imposed a <em>fairly small</em> risk of harm on some in order to (with a <em>high degree</em> of certainty) <em>substantially</em> benefit others.</p>\n<p>Some might disagree.&#xA0; Imagine an absolutist view that implied that, as long as there is <em>some</em> risk that your act will do harm, it&#x2019;s impermissible.&#xA0; Given that we&#x2019;re stuck in the real, risk-filled world, <em>no matter what we do</em> there is <em>some</em> risk we&#x2019;ll do harm, and thus this view implies that no matter what we do, we act impermissibly.&#xA0; However, I acted permissibly just now when I blinked my eyes, so this view is false.&#xA0; (I apologize if through some Butterfly Effect my blinking will in fact cause an avalanche, destroying a town in the Alps&#x2026;)</p>\n<p>The more moderate position above that I said seems sensible contains a number of vaguely specified quantities (in italics).&#xA0; How must these fields be filled in such that no plausible deontological constraint is violated?&#xA0; I am not sure how much precision can, in principle, be offered here.</p>\n<p>But I do think I can offer something useful.&#xA0; Consider a parent who wants to give her 9-year-old son a fun weekend at Disneyland.&#xA0; She also has an infant daughter, who is too young to get any enjoyment out of the trip.&#xA0; The parent drives both children for six hours on the freeway to get to Disneyland, knowing that there is a risk they will be killed in a car accident.&#xA0; Nonetheless, most of us would say that the parent did not violate any plausible deontological constraint; this seems to be in part because the risk of harm she imposed on her children is <em>fairly small</em>.</p>\n<p>I would wager that the risk (of economic harm) to those living in extreme poverty from you donating $50 to <a href=\"http://www.evidenceaction.org/#deworm-the-world\">Deworm the World</a> is also fairly small, probably comparable to the risk of death associated with six hours of freeway driving.&#xA0; And if it&#x2019;s permissible for a parent to impose this fairly small risk of<em> death</em> for a weekend of fun, then presumably it&#x2019;s permissible for a donor to impose a comparably small risk of <em>economic harm</em> to achieve major health benefits for many children ($50 would be enough to deworm 100 children).</p>\n<p>A worry is that the bigger the donation you give, the greater the risk.&#xA0; Very large donations may no longer yield <em>fairly small </em>risks of harm, but sizeable ones.&#xA0; One point to keep in mind here is that while a very large donation may impose more risk of harm, it would bring about correspondingly more <em>benefit</em>.&#xA0; Still, it is unclear how plausible it is that <em>if</em> the amount of risk imposed in donating $50 is made permissible by deworming 100 children, <em>then</em> the amount of risk imposed in donating $5,000 is made permissible by deworming 10,000 children.&#xA0; For one thing, there may well be a non-linear relationship between donation size and risk size.</p>\n<p>But suppose you added up all the annual donations to a particular deworming charity.&#xA0; How much risk (of economic harm) is imposed, in aggregate, by all these donations?&#xA0; I welcome any corrections on this score, but &#x2013; based on what I know about the activities and results of deworming charities over the past several years &#x2013; my guess is that not much risk of economic harm is imposed even by a whole year of donations.&#xA0; I can add to this that there are <a href=\"http://www.povertyactionlab.org/publication/deworming-best-buy-development\">documented economic benefits of deworming</a> (it&#x2019;s easier for people to go to work and school when they aren&#x2019;t infected).&#xA0; Maybe the greatest risk of a mass donation to a deworming charity is decreased government effort.&#xA0; But it turns out that in many places where deworming projects take place <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/deworm-world-initiative#footnote90_6gsjgsh\">it is unlikely governments would have provided funds if NGOs had not</a>.</p>\n<p>One philosophically interesting question is what to make of cases &#x2013; unlike deworming &#x2013; where very large donations <em>do</em> carry with them sizable risks of harm.&#xA0; Then we will have to determine whether the proportionately greater good done by the large donation makes it permissible to impose the large risk.&#xA0; It&#x2019;s possible to hold the view that, once the size of the risk (of some particular harm) is <em>sufficiently large</em>, it would be a violation of the deontological constraint against doing harm to impose this risk even if the good brought about were proportionately greater.&#xA0; That is, maybe R is the risk threshold, and while it&#x2019;s permissible to bring about .25R risk for the sake of saving 1,000 lives, it&#x2019;s impermissible to bring about R risk for the sake of saving 4,000 lives.&#xA0; This view has the implication that, while it would be permissible for me to make a donation every three months to a charity, each which imposes .25R risk and saves 1,000 lives and which would taken together over the course of a year impose R risk and save 4,000 lives, it would be impermissible for me to lump these donations together, making a single annual donation. &#xA0;I don&#x2019;t intend for this to be a convincing objection to the view, I merely want to flag a further philosophically interesting complication.</p>\n<p>Wenar has done us a service by clearly and carefully presenting a number of important considerations that are relevant to donating to overseas aid agencies that aim to help people in extreme poverty.&#xA0; However, I agree with Beckstead that Singer&#x2019;s principle applies to the risk-filled world we donors find ourselves in; and the most highly-ranked charities are also ones that are pretty innocuous from the standpoint of deontological constraints.&#xA0; If you are skeptical of this, but still want to help, you could give to a reputable organization that rigorously studies extreme poverty interventions, such as <a href=\"http://www.poverty-action.org/\">IPA</a> or <a href=\"http://www.povertyactionlab.org/\">J-PAL</a>.&#xA0; There&#x2019;s almost surely no harm in that.</p>\n<p><em>(I am grateful to Peter Singer, Nick Beckstead, and Tom Ash for helpful feedback.)</em></p>\n</div></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Tom_Ash"}}, {"_id": "hE3JqDapM4v8ZdY8B", "title": "Meetup : Lunch meeting: Aid - Does it work?", "postedAt": "2015-01-13T12:40:01.016Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><h2>Discussion article for the meetup : <a href=\"/meetups/1t\">Lunch meeting: Aid - Does it work?</a></h2>\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHEN:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>29 January 2015 12:00:00PM (+0100)</span><br>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHERE:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>NTNU, Trondheim, Norway</span>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t  </div><!-- .meta -->\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t    <div><p>Have you ever wondered about if aid actually helps the people who get it?

This would provide a tax credit of one dollar for each dollar of charitable giving, up to a certain limit, perhaps 10% of one&#x2019;s incomes.

Until further evidence is in, or until much wider consensus is reached, the only rational approach is to spread your degrees of belief between different ethical theories.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I find this notion unconvincing because I view morality as subjective. For example, if I believe bribery is wrong and someone else believes it&apos;s morally acceptable, I think neither of us is (in)correct. Instead, we simply differ in our moral preferences, similarly to how I might think apples are tasty while someone else thinks they&apos;re gross. This view is sufficient to reject the notion of moral uncertainty described above, but there are at least two ways we can plausibly attempt to preserve the conclusion that we should accommodate alternative moral frameworks in our decision-making.</p>\n<p>First, although it seems to me very unlikely and even incomprehensible to have a correct<sup>2</sup>&#xA0;morality, one that is objective true independent of whose perspective we use, the existence of a correct morality (this belief is often called&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.philosophybasics.com/branch_moral_realism.html\">moral realism</a>) is an empirical belief so I do accept a <a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/why-the-modesty-argument-for-moral-realism-fails/\">modesty argument</a><sup>1 </sup>for its possibility.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Start with the premise of</p>\n<p><span> </span><em>Nonrealist Nihilism</em>: If moral realism is false, then nothing matters.</p>\n<p>Now, suppose you think the probability of moral realism is P. Then when you consider taking some action, the expected value of the action is</p>\n<p><span> </span>P * (value if moral realism is true) + (1-P) * (value if moral realism is false)</p>\n<p><span> </span>= P * (value if moral realism is true) + (1-P) * 0</p>\n<p>where the substitution with 0 follows from the Nonrealist Nihilism premise. Therefore, we can prudentially assume that moral realism is true.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>In this link above, Brian Tomasik points out some good reasons for rejecting this argument. But even given the argument holds, moral realism seems so weird and incomprehensible that I see no reason to prefer any possible moral realisms (e.g. utilitarianism, libertarianism) over any other, so each possible moral realism is canceled out by an equally likely opposite realism (e.g. utilitarianism says happiness is good, but anti-utilitarianism says happiness is bad so these cancel out) and the argument fails.</p>\n<p>The second rescue of moral uncertainty is more tenable and, as far as I know, was first formalized by Ruair&#xED; Donnelly. We can call it&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.ruairidonnelly.com/moral-uncertainty/\">anti-realist moral uncertainty</a>. This is how I&apos;d describe this idea:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I accept some uncertainty in what my future self will morally value. If I am a utilitarian today, I accept I might not be a utilitarian tomorrow. Therefore, I choose to give some weight to these future values.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I, personally, choose not to account for the values of my future self in my moral decisions. If I did, I might expect my future values to be more similar to the average human morality. So, it seems to be simply a matter of personal preference. I think this reframing of moral uncertainty makes sense, even if I don&apos;t see reason that I should adopt it.<br><br>Lastly, it is important to note that even without accommodating for moral uncertainty, there are still <a href=\"http://foundational-research.org/publications/reasons-to-be-nice-to-other-value-systems/\">good reasons</a> to cooperate with people whose value systems differ from our own.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>[1] I am not sure who first came up with these two terms (moral uncertainty and the modesty argument), so I just used the most frequently used write-ups I know of for each term.</p>\n<p>[2] By correct, I mean correct in the way it is correct that the sky is blue.</p></body></html>", "user": null}, {"_id": "Si9r4zbXCXzoGCAQy", "title": "EA Vloging", "postedAt": "2015-01-10T00:55:46.692Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>Hey Everyone! &#xA0;As part of my role as the Director of Community of Giving What We Can, I plan to do a bit of vloging in the future. &#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QArAIXxGpcs\">This</a> is my most recent video explaining why Giving What We Can recommends The Against Malaria Foundation. &#xA0;If you have any suggestions for improving videos in the future, or any suggestions on what topics I should aim to cover, I would love to hear from you!</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "jonathancourtney"}}, {"_id": "jJnT2gagkZ8PBnmAN", "title": "Meetup : A critique of effective altruism", "postedAt": "2015-01-09T20:10:56.333Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><h2>Discussion article for the meetup : <a href=\"/meetups/1s\">A critique of effective altruism</a></h2>\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHEN:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>18 January 2015 02:00:00PM (+0100)</span><br>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHERE:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>Utrecht, La Place, Rijnkade 5</span>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t  </div><!-- .meta -->\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t    <div><p>We have meetups about effective altruism every two weeks.

Skypeing with new members is also really helpful as it lets us to get to know our members a bit better, and lets us know more more about who is taking the pledge and why.</p>\n<p>Over the last few months I have hosted two social events for members, a dinner in London in October, and a dinner in November to celebrate Giving What We Can&#x2019;s fifth anniversary.&#xA0; Both of these events were a lot of fun.&#xA0; I think that having more in person events to allow members to get to know one another in person is really important.&#xA0; If you would like to organize a meet up or event in your local area, I would be happy to help! &#xA0;Email me at: jonathan.courtney@givingwhatwecan.org</p>\n<p>Perhaps one of the less glamorous, but no less enjoyable parts of my job is sending out the physical pledge letters to all of the new members of Giving What We Can.&#xA0; As those of you who have signed up know, shortly after you take the pledge, you receive a letter in the mail welcoming you, discussing our recommended charities in a bit more detail, and giving you a physical pledge form that you can sign and keep as a keepsake.&#xA0; While this is a small gesture, I really enjoy it as it is a physically tangible representation of Giving What We Can&#x2019;s membership growth.&#xA0; It is always great to see membership numbers grown on our <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/dashboard\">dashboard</a>, but somehow it feels more real when I am sending out pledge forms!</p>\n<p>One of the other great aspects of my role is that it allows me to give presentations for many our UK Chapters.&#xA0; Its great not only because I can share Giving What We Can&#x2019;s research and perspective with people who haven&#x2019;t heard of it before, but it also gives me a chance to meet and interact with some of the amazing chapters we have all over the UK. I will talk about these presentations in more detail in my next post.</p>\n<p>Along with my other main actions I occasionally branch out to try some other projects.&#xA0; One recent venture was participating the <a href=\"http://www.projectforawesome.com/\">The Project for Awesome</a>, which is a online fundraising campaign hosted by famous youtubers John and Hank Greene.&#xA0; With the help of several amazing Giving What We Can members, we were able to get a bit of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SNHht8pS5L0\">visibility</a> thought the project, and we are excited to give an even more impressive video next year! &#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Help me do better!</em></p>\n<p>These are a few of the things that keep me busy as the Director of Community, but I would love to have your feedback!&#xA0; One of the best things about working for Giving What We Can is that we are constantly looking to improve and are flexible enough to shift our time and energy to whichever actions look the most promising.&#xA0; If you have ideas about projects or actions which you think would be highly effected, either in growing the community, or just promoting Giving What We Can more generally, feel free to send me an email at: jonathan.courtney@givingwhatwecan.org</p>\n<p>These last few months have been really great, and I look forward to continuing to help to grow the Giving What We Can community in the coming months!</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "jonathancourtney"}}, {"_id": "xSQwZ4ekqdgL9wyvb", "title": "EA Origin Story: Changing", "postedAt": "2015-01-06T14:16:03.470Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><em>Cross-posted from <a href=\"http://a-nice-place-to-live.blogspot.ca/2015/01/changing.html\">A Nice Place To Live</a>.</em></p>\n<p><span>For this month&apos;s Figuring Good Out, the topic is &quot;EA origin stories.&quot;&#xA0;I don&apos;t think of myself as &quot;</span><em>an</em><span>&#xA0;EA&quot; and I can&apos;t remember how things happened very well. Looking back, the years blend together and I can&apos;t quite remember the cause-and-effect of it all. But here&apos;s a story.</span></p>\n<p><span> I&apos;ve always been interested in philosophical questions and arguments.&#xA0;I think my main obsessions as a teenager were art (what makes &quot;good art&quot; good?), morality (what makes &quot;good deeds&quot; good?), and atheism. Coming from a broken home where I spent alternating weekends with my orthodox Jewish father and my basically-secular Jewish mother, I grew up in a uniquely good environment to produce anti-religious views. I&apos;d go from eating McDonald&apos;s one day to waiting six hours between meat and dairy the next. One Saturday I&apos;d watch cartoons all day and eat in front of the TV. The next Saturday I&apos;d have to go to synagogue and sit silently through&#xA0;<em>kiddush</em>. Who could grow up in these conditions and see the religious bits as anything other than unnecessary inconveniences?</span><span><br> </span><span><br> I never lost my faith, I just never believed to begin with. I remember one of the teachers at my Jewish high school asking the class about their religious beliefs. I was surprised at all the hands going up. I remember walking home as a teenager and the thought occurring to me for the first time that everyone else&#xA0;<em>actually believes this stuff</em>. When hearing the stories from the Old Testament as a kid, I had always thought of them as fables like Jack and the Beanstalk and The Boy Who Cried Wolf. It had weirdly never really occurred to me that everybody around me, including the adults, thought Jonah and the Whale was non-fiction.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> When the New Atheism movement emerged, I was an easy sell. Dawkins and Hitchens led me to Harris and Dennett, who led me to Pinker, Krauss, and Singer, who led me to the Churchlands and to science communicators like Michio Kaku, Neil Degrasse Tyson, Brian Greene, and Dan Ariely. And the arguments against religion brought me to David Hume and Bertrand Russell and the circle kept expanding.&#xA0;</span><span><br> </span><span><br> I took some philosophy electives in school: Intro to Philosophy of Science, Philosophy of Mind, and then another course that talked exclusively about Kant for the first half (and then apparently talked exclusively about Hegel for the second half but I stopped going by that point). I kept reading. Sam Harris&apos;s book&#xA0;<em>The Moral Landscape</em>&#xA0;got me to change my mind about one of my favourite topics. At the time, I had a softer stance on morality where nothing could be objectively good or bad because something-about-culture. Still though, becoming a consequentialist had no real effect on my behaviour. I read his book, agreed with his arguments, changed my beliefs, and did nothing.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> Fortunately, I had already read two books by Peter Singer in my first year of university. The first,&#xA0;<em>The Life You Can Save</em>, I read after my Philosophy of Science teacher told our class about an argument that one moral philosopher makes for giving to the poor. He confessed that although the argument had initially made him feel guilty, he&apos;d found possible weak points in the philosopher&apos;s premises after further consideration. I had never heard of Peter Singer before but I, for one, had not been able to find these weak points and was still feeling guilty. I read his book, agreed with his arguments, changed my beliefs, and did nothing.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> The second book I read by Peter Singer was&#xA0;<em>Animal Liberation</em>. I had always been kind of sympathetic to animal suffering but never really cared enough to inconvenience myself over it. Singer&apos;s book was an eye opener for me. He kept quoting this amazing passage by Jeremy Bentham (who I&apos;d never heard of) that made everything clear. Although I became very confident that eating animals was immoral, and tentatively thought that I would like to become a vegetarian in the future, my general stance on the issue was: eating meat is bad but I just don&apos;t care. I read his book, agreed with his arguments, changed my beliefs, and still I did nothing.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> This sort of pop philosophy and pop science became one of my main past times. I read articles from my favourite philosophers on a daily basis. A friend and I began a pact where every day we&apos;d send each other one new article to read. I remember the excitement I&apos;d found when, after about a week of doing this, I discovered Daniel Dennett&apos;s <a href=\"http://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/dennett/bibliography.html\">Tufts University page</a> online. It contained the PDFs for what seemed to be every article he&apos;d ever written, spanning back several decades. I decided to read through all of them in order, a few each day. I never got more than a few articles deep. My friend called me one day to tell me that everything had changed - that he had found enough reading material to keep us both busy for ages - it was endless - it was all compiled into neat sections on this one website - and so my attention turned toward LessWrong.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> My friend had been in a phase of figuring out what he wanted to do with his life, so he was emailing all sorts of folks in various professional fields to ask for advice. One of these people worked for an organization called the Singularity Institute. The employee (Malo), sent my friend a long list of reading material, including the Sequences. I began reading and it was right up my alley.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> There&apos;s a specific feeling I get when I have more exciting reading material than I have energy to stay up any longer. I can&apos;t remember how long it took me to read the Sequences but I know that I was reading for hours a day and I have particularly warm memories of the How to Actually Use Words section.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> Through these, I got into &quot;rationality&quot; and became more interested in cognitive biases. I read&#xA0;<em>Thinking, Fast and Slow</em>&#xA0;and it became my new favourite book. I read&#xA0;<em>Nudge</em>&#xA0;by Thaler and Sunstein. I read Luke Muehlhauser&apos;s&#xA0;<a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/\"><span>Common Sense Atheism</span></a>&#xA0;blog basically cover to cover within a month. I read mountains of material, agreed with many arguments, changed my beliefs many times, and still I did nothing.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> At some point, I heard the term &quot;effective altruism.&quot; It may have been on LessWrong. It may have been on Luke&apos;s podcast. It may have been from Peter Singer. Or from my friend. Or from following Eliezer Yudkowsky on Facebook. The origin of my EA story is the fuzziest part of my EA origin story.&#xA0;At any rate, I discovered the movement and felt no resistance to any of its ideas.&#xA0;As mentioned earlier, I had already bought Singer&apos;s argument for EA from the moment my teacher told it to my class, years prior.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> The ideas had grown on me to the point that I was becoming more interested in all this rationality and philosophy talk than I was in the topic of my career and education. When I entered my MA in Media Production, I had no ideas at all for the sort of creative video project I had planned to produce. My mind was in philosophy mode. A couple of epiphanies about art later, I decided to write a thesis paper about what an effective altruist worldview has to say about artistic value.&#xA0;<span><a href=\"https://www.academia.edu/8094582/Fiction_Fast_and_Slow_Narrative_Media_As_A_Tool_for_Social_Change\">My paper</a>&#xA0;</span>transformed many times in the telling but it sort of stuck to that theme.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> In the early days of researching my paper, I began to realize how big my topic was. If I wanted it to be as good as my favourite books and papers, I&apos;d have to learn a lot more. I&#xA0;emailed Brian Tomasik, whose blog I had been reading. In hindsight, I don&apos;t know why I emailed him given that my project had so little to do with his subject matter. He responded that no, I didn&apos;t need to learn game theory and to my surprise, he added me on Facebook. For the past year or so, I&apos;ve asked Brian a totally random question on Facebook about once a month (&quot;hey, so how does eating meat compare to buying from Nike?&quot;). He played a big part (along with the documentary,&#xA0;<em>Earthlings</em>) in me finally becoming a vegetarian.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> Now that I think about it, when I first emailed Brian, I asked him if I could join the Foundational Research Institute, naively thinking that I was qualified. He responded that I should create my own blog to showcase my abilities. I started A Nice Place To Live and posted 1+ post a day for the first month with Brian as my only reader.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> Slowly, in incremental steps, I approached the cluster of properties associated with effective altruism. I started reading GiveWell&apos;s blog. I familiarized myself with more theory on existential risk. I completed my thesis paper. I once donated $50 to the&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/Default.aspx\"><span>Against Malaria Foundation</span></a>. But really, I&apos;ve changed very little.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> Now, I participate in the EA blogging carnival that I created, post on the EA forum, have a bunch of EA Facebook friends, and I&#xA0;<em>think</em>&#xA0;a lot of EAs know who I am but I&apos;m not sure about that. If at some point in this story, I crossed the threshold of EA-dom, I cannot point to any explicit point of origin.</span></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Bitton"}}, {"_id": "vWSqS3j6sZpRizzNf", "title": "Tentative Thoughts on the SENS Foundation", "postedAt": "2015-01-06T02:39:01.021Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Edit from fucking 2019: this is all obviously wrong, EA is a scam, do all your own analysis of everything if you want to have an impact</p><p><em>This post has been <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/r/discussion/lw/lh9/tentative_thoughts_on_the_cost_effectiveness_of/\">cross-posted</a> to LessWrong.</em></p><p>It should be emphasized that back-of-the-envelope calculations, such as the one given in this post, ought to be <a href=\"/ea/bb/expected_value_estimates_you_can_take_somewhat/\">adjusted</a>\u00a0to account for the fact that interventions can <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/08/18/why-we-cant-take-expected-value-estimates-literally-even-when-theyre-unbiased/\">look much more cost-effective than they are</a>, especially when the interventions were only shallowly investigated.</p><p>Previously, Givewell has looked into the cost-effectiveness of <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/26/scientific-research-funding/\">life</a> <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2014/01/07/exploring-life-sciences-funding/\">sciences</a> <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2014/01/15/returns-to-life-sciences-funding/\">funding</a>, as well as publishing a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/trinity.edu/spreadsheets/d/1984cmL2R3IvjwpGg5ckXfBV5Q-qh8F4Flun1tIYZFw4/edit#gid=0\">simple estimate</a> of the impact of the average dollar spent on cancer research, which suggested that, in the past, each\u00a0$2790\u00a0spent on cancer-relevant biomedical\u00a0research in the US\u00a0added one\u00a0year of life lived (YLL) to the life of a US resident. Givewell has also <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/gwg/sens_and_givewell_conversation_between_holden/\">interviewed</a>\u00a0Aubrey de Grey of the SENS foundation. Owencb has previously <a href=\"/ea/c4/make_your_own_costeffectiveness_fermi_estimates/1rb\">estimated</a>\u00a0the cost-effectiveness of funding SENS/ anti-aging research as being around $50 per QALY. Aubrey de Grey has previously <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2012/04/living-to-1000-an-interview-with-aubrey-de-grey/\">been averse to giving explicit cost-effectiveness estimates</a>\u00a0regarding how many QALYs would be gained per unit of funding supplied to SENS, though he has been clear that SENS&#x27;s funding needs are &quot;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2012/04/living-to-1000-an-interview-with-aubrey-de-grey/\">$100 million per year for each of the next ten years</a>&quot;.</p><br/><hr class=\"dividerBlock\"/><br/><p>This part of the post will consist of me using lots of best guesses to produce something vaguely resembling a cost-effectiveness estimate for SENS. You should <em>not</em> take this cost-effectiveness estimate literally.</p><p>If SENS needs one billion dollars to ensure that rejuvenation technologies that give individuals 30 extra years of healthy life are available to the public in 30 years, we might (completely arbitrarily<em>)</em> assume that someone else will come along and fund SENS in ten years if we don&#x27;t contribute to funding SENS today. This means that if we fund SENS today instead waiting for it to be hypothetically funded in ten years from now,\u00a0about ten times the number of people who die each year would live 30 years of healthy life that they wouldn&#x27;t have lived otherwise. Given that there are about 57 million deaths per year worldwide, this translates to about 17 billion YLLs lost by waiting ten years to fund SENS; since SENS ostensibly requires only 1 billion of philanthropic funding, this implies that $0.059 of funding for SENS\u00a0produces a YLL.</p><p>Of course, regenerative medicine won&#x27;t be free to the people receiving it, and I have no idea how to account for this, given that I don&#x27;t have a good idea of how much regenerative therapies will initially cost. The above estimate hasn&#x27;t been adjusted to account for the fact that there is a time-delay between when funding is provided, and when the benefits of regenerative therapies are available to the public. Perhaps Aubrey <a href=\"http://acritch.com/credence-game/\">isn&#x27;t well-calibrated</a>, and the &quot;$100 million per year for ten years&quot; figure is entirely wrong. It may be the case that starting work on SENS&#x27;s research agenda earlier rather than later would allow certain people who would have otherwise died\u00a0to live until aging escape velocity is reached, which would have lots of utility. There are plenty of other issues with this cost-effectiveness estimate which I am sure that readers could point out.</p><p>The point I wanted to make, though, was that maybe, possibly, SENS is competitive with GiveWell&#x27;s top charities-- I&#x27;m legitimately\u00a0not sure\u00a0whether I would fund SENS or GiveWell if I were making a charitable donation today.\u00a0Does anyone have any further thoughts on this topic?</p>", "user": {"username": "Fluttershy"}}, {"_id": "LjeqMHkYavQsaveh3", "title": "TLYCS Pamphleting Pilot Program", "postedAt": "2015-01-05T23:31:15.425Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><span> </span></p>\n<p>I&#x2019;m working on a pamphleting pilot program with the folks over at The Life You Can Save, and I wanted to lay out our plans and hopefully field some useful thoughts and criticisms. First, a couple notes on the motivation for this project. Pamphleting has been used by other advocacy groups (with positive, although debatable, results), but to my knowledge hasn&apos;t been tried by an EA-flavored global poverty organization, so we&apos;re giving it a shot. There is arguably something old-fashioned and appealing about being handed a physical booklet from a real person that differentiates this medium from, say, online ads, and promotes (or so the argument goes) a deeper level of engagement. We&apos;re hoping that the data we collect, which TLYCS will be using to decide whether to continue it&apos;s program, will be useful to other groups as well, so we wanted to field some feedback here.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>The basic thrust of the project is right out of the Vegan Outreach playbook; put together a leaflet that targets college age students with material relating to global poverty interventions and effective altruism, and hand them out on college campuses on a rolling, semester basis. Whereas for VO the ultimate goal of pamphleting is to make vegans, the goal for the TLYCS pamphlets is to get students to engage with the material <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/\">on the website</a> and then take <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/take-the-pledge\">TLYCS&apos;s pledge</a>. We have our pamphlet nearly finished and plan to start handing them out this spring semester at Southern California universities. In this pilot program, we really want to, 1.) explore the logistical challenges in running this kind of activity, and 2.) try and gauge the effectiveness of pamphleting versus other methods of spreading the message. It is on point two that I am keen to get feedback, so I&#x2019;ll outline our current thoughts on this.</p>\n<p>I plan to hand out pamphlets on discrete days during the pilot period (say, every other friday for several months), and keep track of how many booklets are handed out during each distribution. This should allow us to monitor traffic spikes (or lack of them) to the website from IP addresses in the distribution zone, as well as spikes in pledge signups, which can serve as a preliminary indication of engagement. We will also be pushing a special landing page that is only advertised in the pamphlets as another metric to gauge impact. This would be analogous to VO&#x2019;s vegetarian starter guide offer, in that the offer require&apos;s the reader to actually do something, and therefore ostensibly reflects a more significant level of engagement. We initially envisioned directing students to a &#x201C;special message&#x201D; from TLYCS, which might be a video from Peter Singer or someone else in the organization offering an in-person invitation to explore the site and take the pledge. Another thought was to invite students to play an online version of TYLCS&#x2019;s Giving Game, where they visit the website and choose which of four charities will receive a dollar donation. However, there was some disagreement on the team whether offering a strong &#x201C;hook&#x201D; to get people to come to the site would muddy the effectiveness of the pamphlet qua pamphlet. For instance, TLYCS offers in-person Giving Game workshops, and it was thought that pitching an online version of the Giving Game in the pamphlets would make it harder to compare the effectiveness of the pamphlets versus the in-person workshops. As something of a compromise, we are now inviting students to <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/quiz\">take a quiz</a> (just a shell site right now) in which they answer questions and then get paired up with one of TLYCS&#x2019;s recommended charities. I&#x2019;d be very interested in what people think on this point; what&#x2019;s the right balance between pushing a really strong hook in the pamphlet (e.g. video from Peter Singer, invitation to play Giving Game), versus keeping the pamphlet as independent as possible so we can tell how engaging of a medium it is?</p>\n<p>Ultimately, we&#x2019;d like to come out of the pilot program with a metric that falls somewhere close to &#x201C;cost per TLYCS pledger via pamphlets&#x201D; that we can compare with other outreach efforts (online ads, in-person workshops, etc), and use in deciding whether to expand the program or abandon it. To summarize, I&#x2019;m really interested in hearing comments on:</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Are we making any obvious mistakes in our approach to measuring the effectiveness of the pamphlets?</li>\n<li>What is the right balance to strike between pitching a strong &#x201C;hook&#x201D; in our pamphlets versus keeping them &#x201C;clean&#x201D; so that only the appeal of the pamphlets as a medium is measured?</li>\n<li>Is there anything we can tweak in our pilot that would make it more relevant and useful to other organizations considering a pamphleting program?</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span> </span></p>\n<p>Thanks all, and look forward to hearing from you!</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "jonathonsmith"}}, {"_id": "B3fYvmwJLRiDeM6Cd", "title": "The Outside Critics of Effective Altruism", "postedAt": "2015-01-05T18:37:48.862Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><a><br><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/S3O2clo.png\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>Note: if you&apos;ve come here because you would like to give your first impression of effective altruism, then introductions are&#xA0;<a href=\"/ea/45/what_is_effective_altruism/\">here</a>&#xA0;and&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.ted.com/talks/peter_singer_the_why_and_how_of_effective_altruism.html\">here</a>.</p>\n<p>Note2: Robin Hanson has <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2015/01/on-exposing-hypocrisy.html\">outlined some problems</a> with exposing misalignment between others&apos; actions and professed beliefs about charity.</p>\n<p>---</p>\n<p>Today,&#xA0;Robin Hanson <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2015/01/show-outside-critics.html\">wrote a blog post</a>&#xA0;that explains the importance of outside criticism.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Friendly local criticism isn&apos;t usually directed at trying to show a wider audience flaws in your arguments.

They also debated some&#xA0;<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/cxj/debate_between_80000_hours_and_a_socialist/\">socialists</a>. But these discussions were brief and narrowly focussed clashes between entrenched political ideologies. Others have targeted us for criticism that was so vitriolic that it was hard to find the constructive parts, such as <a href=\"http://www.philanthropydaily.com/the-coming-showdown-between-philanthrolocalism-and-effective-altruism\">William Schambra</a>, <a href=\"http://www.ssireview.org/blog/entry/the_elitist_philanthropy_of_so_called_effective_altruism\">Ken Berger and Robert Penna</a>&#xA0;and the always sarcastic&#xA0;<a href=\"http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Effective_altruism\">RationalWiki</a>. <em>Edit: also some criticism by <a href=\"http://www.philanthropydaily.com/earnest-but-inhumane/\">Scott Walter</a>.</em></p>\n<p>So several years into our movement, that&apos;s all we have to show for criticism. A few insiders and a few fanatics? It&apos;s not to say we can&apos;t harvest some insights from there - by god we should try. But one would hope we have more.</p>\n<p>If we cast the net wider, Warren&apos;s son <a href=\"http://qz.com/201778/warren-buffetts-son-philanthropy-disguises-itself-as-a-fix-when-its-a-part-of-the-problem/\">Peter Buffett</a>&#xA0;has debated William MacAskill on the effectiveness of charity, which is kind-of cool. There are more general aid critics:&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.cato-unbound.org/2006/04/02/william-easterly/why-doesnt-aid-work\">William Easterly</a>, who is a fairly thoughtful economist and <a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Dead-Aid-working-another-Africa/dp/0141031182]\">Dambisa Moyo</a>, who I know less about. But these they don&apos;t really get to the heart of what we care about - if most aid is ineffective, then it would just be important to research it even harder.</p>\n<p>Alternatively, we can look at more narrowly focused critics. LessWrong is often mentioned as a useful source for criticism, and it has usefully challenged philosophical positions held by some effective altruists. Its founder, Eliezer Yudkowsky has challenged hedonistic utilitarianism and some forms of moral realism in the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/xy/the_fun_theory_sequence/\">Fun</a>&#xA0;<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/y0/31_laws_of_fun/\">Theory</a>&#xA0;sequence, the enigmatic (or merely misunderstood) <a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Metaethics_sequence\">Metaethics</a>&#xA0;<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/lp/fake_utility_functions/\">sequence</a>&#xA0;and the fictionalised dilemma <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/y4/three_worlds_collide_08/\">Three Worlds Collide</a>. But these mostly address utilitarians and spare other&#xA0;effective altruists. Of course, Eliezer no outsider to effective altruism - he played some part in founding it. The most upvoted post on LessWrong of all time was in fact feedback <a href=\"/esswrong.com/lw/cbs/thoughts_on_the_singularity_institute_si\">from Holden Karnofsky</a>&#xA0;about its sponsor-organisation MIRI. Again, the relevance of this to most EAs is a stretch.</p>\n<p>In turn, Holden Karnofsky has recieved suggestions for GiveWell might react to philosophical considerations by LessWrong veterans like <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2013/09/14/effective-altruism-and-flow-through-effects/\">Paul Christiano, Carl Shulman</a>,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://intelligence.org/2014/01/27/existential-risk-strategy-conversation-with-holden-karnofsky/\">Eliezer</a>&#xA0;and <a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/6o/conversation_with_holden_karnofsky_nick_beckstead/\">Nick Beckstead</a>. Again, all insiders.</p>\n<p>So here&apos;s how I sum up our problem. Almost all of our critics are insiders. Barring a couple of heroic attempts at self-criticism, we&apos;ve primarily attracted criticism about donating and earning to give. We&apos;ve also offended a couple of fanatics, and I don&apos;t have a strong view on whether we&apos;ve learned from those. This is unsurprising. Taking self-criticism is hard and endorsing it or writing it is harder. Eliezer would say it feels like <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/gw/politics_is_the_mindkiller/\">shooting one of your own men</a>. Scott Siskind says, &quot;Criticizing the in-group is a really difficult project I&#x2019;ve barely begun to build the mental skills necessary to even consider. I can think of criticisms of my own tribe. Important criticisms, true ones. But the thought of writing them makes my blood boil.&quot;</p>\n<p>But criticism seems especially important now as effective altruism is growing fast, our culture is starting to consolidate on the Facebook group and here and as we model it in the&#xA0;<a href=\"/ea/d1/list_of_introductory_ea_presentations/\">popular talks</a> and <a href=\"/effectivealtruism.org\">introductory</a> <a href=\"/ea/6x/introduction_to_effective_altruism/\">materials</a>&#xA0;that we give to new community members.</p>\n<p>To develop the effective altruist movement, it&apos;s essential that we ask people how we&apos;ve failed, or how our ideas are inadequate.</p>\n<p>So an important challenge for all of us is to find better critics.</p>\n<p>Let me know if there&apos;s any big criticm that I&apos;ve missed, or if you know someone who can engage with and poke holes in our ideas.</p>\n<p>Related: <a href=\"/r/main/ea/d2/the_perspectives_on_effective_altruism_we_dont/\">The perspectives on Effective Altruism we Don&apos;t Hear</a> by Jess Whittlestone. <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/lr/evaporative_cooling_of_group_beliefs/\">The Evaporative Cooling of Group Beliefs</a></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "RyanCarey"}}, {"_id": "iTQ44empnAiq6jbHX", "title": "January Meetups Thread", "postedAt": "2015-01-05T16:08:38.455Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><a><br><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/cw7Br0J.png\" alt=\"\"></a></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Here are some meetups coming up in the next month.

I&apos;ve always enjoyed hearing these, both for their inherent human interest and for what they reveal about ways to get people into EA, and the sorts of people who are receptive to it. So here are some common sorts of origin stories, based on accounts people have given me and the answers people gave in <a href=\" http://survey.effectivealtruismhub.com/?s=t-eaf-030115\">last year&apos;s EA survey</a>. I also give the raw figures from the survey. If you fit into one of these categories I&apos;d love to hear from you in comments - and if you haven&apos;t yet <a href=\" http://survey.effectivealtruismhub.com/?s=t-eaf-030115\">taken the survey</a> it would be valuable to get your answers via this!&#xA0;</p>\n<p>EA origin stories typically have two elements. One is how people first heard about the term or the community; the other is what convinced them of EA ideas. Many EAs I&apos;ve spoken to about this - I think a majority - were already sold on EA ideas before hearing the term. A significant fraction knew them under another label, such as &apos;utilitarianism&apos; or &apos;utilitarian or Singerite ideas about charity&apos; - I was one of these. There was an active community discussing them on the utilitarian forum <a href=\"http://felicifia.org/\">Felicifia</a>.</p>\n<p>In the EA survey we had two separate questions asking about these two elements. The first was &quot;How did you first hear about &apos;Effective Altruism&apos;?&quot;. This was a single choice question, which was explicitly about the <em>term</em>&#xA0;&apos;Effective Altruism&apos;, although several people interpreted it &#xA0;as being about EA ideas. (I&apos;d be interested to hear people&apos;s thoughts about what the most interesting such questions would be for this year&apos;s survey.) The second question was &quot;Which factors were important in &apos;getting you into&apos; Effective Altruism, or altering your actions in its direction?&quot; This was a multiple choice question.</p>\n<p>The kinds of EA origin story that I list below can apply to either of these questions. Some will explain how people heard about the term EA more often than they explain how they got convinced by EA ideas, and for some the opposite will hold.&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>The list of origins</h2>\n<h3><span>Friends</span></h3>\n<p><strong></strong><span>This category can be split into people who were </span><em>convinced</em><span>&#xA0;of effective altruism by friends and those who merely heard the term from them, but were already on board with the ideas or were easily sold on them.&#xA0;</span><span>126 survey respondents reported first hearing about EA from friends, 237 said personal contact was important in getting them into it, and 196 said the same of friends or family. Note that since the question about the factors that were important in getting people into EA was multiple choice, there was some overlap between the last two categories.</span></p>\n<p><span>This category overlaps with some of the others below; for example, some people who got into EA through local groups made friends in these groups, and these friendships were sometimes more important than the other activities of the group. Some survey respondents in this boat likely only picked the &apos;local groups&apos; option, so the numbers above will be underestimates.</span></p>\n<p><span>I&apos;m an example of someone who heard about EA (before the term) from a friend - <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/user/pablo-stafforini\">Pablo Stafforini</a> - but was already fully on board with the ideas, for example planning to give a large proportion of my income to effective charities. <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/user/lucas-zamprogno\">Lucas Zamprogno</a> is an example of someone who got on board partly due to an existing friendship (in his case with <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/user/joey-savoie\">Joey Savoie</a>).</span></p>\n<h3><span>People who came to EA conclusions independently</span></h3>\n<p><span>There is some ambiguity in what this category means. Of course, no one reaches EA conclusions in a vacuum, and we are all influenced by the universe of ideas and arguments that we encounter. So the interesting questions are really to what extent people came across preformed EA ideas (for example through reading about them in Peter Singer&apos;s writings or an EA blog), and to what extent they convinced themselves of them rather than hearing persuasive arguments from others.</span></p>\n<p><span>These are not easy questions to settle. For example, utilitarianism involves or implies several EA principles, so arguably someone who came to EA via encountering utilitarianism did not arrive at it independently. But saying this seems too strict, because someone who accepts utilitarianism and derives EA ideas from it has done a lot of the work themselves, compared to someone who becomes an EA through, say, reading the <a href=\"/ea/6x/introduction_to_effective_altruism/\">introductory articles on this forum</a>.</span></p>\n<p><span>I know many people who came to EA via utilitarianism, myself included, so my impression is that a lot of EAs fall into this category. It&apos;s hard to get numbers from the EA survey, but some of the answers people gave for the ways in which they first heard the term suggest they are examples of this. For example, 13 people said they heard about it through internet searches, and presumably some of them were searching for others convinced of positions that they already accepted. I know that this was the case for&#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/user/joey-savoie\">Joey Savoie</a>. Likewise, the most common reported way for people to hear about EA was LessWrong (with 257 survey respondents picking this option). LessWrong readers will encounter arguments for EA, so it&apos;s hard to estimate how many of them were already convinced of it, but my impression is that if you find LessWrong you&apos;re likely to already share a certain perspective rather than getting convinced of it through reading.</p>\n<h3><strong>Local groups</strong></h3>\n<p>Local groups are a major form of EA outreach on the part of grassroots EAs (and of EA organisations, insofar as some groups brand themselves as chapters of these). There are <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/groups\">52 listed on the EA Hub</a>, with more groups steadily creating pages there. Despite this only 12 survey respondents reported first hearing about EA through a group, and only 97 said one was important in getting them involved. However, these figures may be an underestimate, because some people will have picked out an EA organisation instead when they got involved through a chapter of this. For example, 82 people said they first heard about EA through GWWC, 42 through GiveWell, 41 through 80,000 Hours, and 38 through The Life You Can Save. These are still pretty low numbers however.</p>\n<h3>EA organisations, blogs and online communities</h3>\n<p>Many people may have come to EA conclusions independently, but they had to hear the term independently, and if it wasn&apos;t through a friend or local groups, it was likely via reading about it. One place to do so is on a website or blog, such as that of an EA organisation, or the broad EA blogosphere, including LessWrong and this very forum. Some of the people who reported hearing about EA through an organisation - listed above - presumably fall into this category. And significantly more people (257) reported hearing about it through LessWrong, such as <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/user/david-perry\">David Perry</a>&#xA0;and <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/user/alice-monday\">Alice Monday</a>.</p>\n<p>GiveWell is notable here in that relatively few people reported first hearing about EA through it - perhaps because it does not use the term often - but it was the second most common factor in getting people more involved after LessWrong, playing an important role for 267 people. It is after all what many of us rely on in choosing charities.</p>\n<h3>Media reporting</h3>\n<p>Besides the EA blogosphere, effective altruism has also been reported on by mainstream media with a very large reach. However I haven&apos;t personally heard of anyone getting involved in EA through this, and only a handful of people reported doing so in the survey.</p>\n<h3>Peter Singer</h3>\n<p>Peter Singer is arguably the world&apos;s most famous effective altruist, and has an enormous reach among both philosophy students and the general public. His TED talk alone has had 1.1 million reported views on the TED website, and 43 survey respondents reported hearing about EA through it, including <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/user/kelly-atlas\">Kelly Atlas</a> and <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/user/jim-greenbaum\">Jim Greenbaum</a>. A few also singled out Singer as important in getting them into EA, such as <a href=\"http://effectivealtruismhub.com/user/michael-dickens\">Michael Dickens</a>.</p>\n<h3>Other social movements</h3>\n<p>EAs sometimes identified with other social movements beforehand, and some were heavily involved in these. Not many people mentioned these as parts of their origin stories in the survey, but we did ask what movements people identified with. 311 said animal rights, 390 said environmentalism, 669 said rationalist/LessWrong, 374 said transhumanism, and 601 said skepticism/atheism. Presumably many of these did not come to EA through these movements. However, I have heard of people doing so, in particular through rationalism, skepticism and atheism. Of note, the Swiss EA group initially colonised some university freethought societies.&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>The raw figures from the EA survey</h2>\n<p>As a reminder, Peter Hurford and the survey analysis team will be releasing the full results for this soon, but by way of a sneak peak here are the figures for the questions discussed above.</p>\n<h3>How did you first hear about &apos;Effective Altruism&apos;?</h3>\n<p>LessWrong<br> 257<br> Friend<br> 126<br> GWWC<br> 82<br> TLYCS<br> 38<br> TED Talk (Peter Singer)<br> 43<br> GiveWell<br> 42<br> 80K<br> 41<br> Facebook<br> 35<br> Search<br> 13<br> Local Group<br> 12<br> Swiss EAs<br> 9<br> CEA<br> 9<br> Leverage<br> 4<br> Felicifia<br> 3<br> CFAR<br> 3<br> ACE<br> 3<br> THINK<br> 1</p>\n<h3>Which factors were important in &apos;getting you into&apos; Effective Altruism, or altering your actions in its direction?</h3>\n<p>LessWrong<br> 316<br> GiveWell<br> 267<br> Personal contact<br> 237<br> Friends/Family<br> 196<br> GWWC<br> 180<br> 80K<br> 150<br> Online EAs<br> 144<br> Peter Singer (including TED Talk and TLYCS)<br> 113<br> Local group<br> 97</p>\n<h2>What was your origin story?</h2>\n<p>As I mentioned above, I&apos;d love to hear your origin stories in comments, and if you haven&apos;t yet&#xA0;<a href=\" http://survey.effectivealtruismhub.com/?s=t-eaf-030115\">taken the EA survey</a>&#xA0;it would be valuable to get your answers via this.

I was offered to either be a software engineer or a data scientist, and I chose to become a data scientist, because I thought the career was more intrinsically interesting and data science seems to me to be more likely to have some staying power if it turns out we&#x2019;re in another tech bubble (which seems quite plausible to me).</p>\n<p>I was excited by this transition because while I felt like I had worked a lot with statistics in college, I didn&#x2019;t know a lot about how it worked in the real world, where the statistical models would be under a lot of demand. I learned a lot about &#x201C;data engineering&#x201D;, which is the work of moving data around and building data pipelines that can work under heavy load. I spent much more of my job doing that, and actually haven&#x2019;t learned much data science yet.</p>\n<p>While I feel like I learned a lot about R in my last review (July-Sep &#x2018;14), I definitely didn&#x2019;t know as much about it as I did now. I feel pretty confident now in both R and Ruby, and can now look back on some of the code I wrote July-Sep &#x2018;14 and laugh at how much of a beginner I once was. I think I got my first tastes of &#x201C;advanced&#x201D; R scripting in Oct-Dec &#x2018;14, which culminated in writing the plugin <a href=\"https://github.com/peterhurford/batchman\"><span>Batchman</span></a> for batching processes in R. I&#x2019;m excited to learn more!</p>\n<p>I also got my first taste of &#x201C;big data&#x201D;, where the amount of data I was working with was too big for R to handle all at once. This is new for me, and also pretty new for our start-up. There are definitely more mainstream tools to be used here (e.g., Hadoop), but I took the approach of trying to build some tools for R to work with big data instead.</p>\n<p>Lastly, I took the chance to work on some different skills and picked up more responsibilities by becoming a part-part-time project manager for our team. Most of the teams here have their own full-time project managers, but data science was too domain heavy to make it easy to recruit one. I volunteered to fill that gap. So I&#x2019;ve been applying organizational skills to make sure our team is on-track.</p>\n<p><br> Overall, I really like my co-workers, I feel like I&#x2019;m learning a lot, I feel like my work is high challenge while still being possible, and I really like our work&#x2019;s flexible schedule to allow me to work on EA projects when I want to.</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;ve also been excited by the salary afforded to me by this job, which has allowed me to make some donations, noted in my <a href=\"http://peterhurford.com/other/donations.html\"><span>donation log</span></a>.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Day Job: What Went Wrong</strong></p>\n<p>I do feel bad about the 25.5hrs a week figure.</p>\n<p>I can defend it, of course. First, I&#x2019;m using an actual timer to determine how much time I actually work, and I&#x2019;m not counting going out for lunch or even going to the bathroom. If you took a typical 40hr/wk person and subtracted out their Reddit time and bathroom time and lunch hours, I&#x2019;m sure they would be much lower than 40 hours.</p>\n<p>Second, there was an awful lot of holidays in November and December, and I took two weeks off.</p>\n<p>Third, I feel like data science, and anything with software really, is truly a &#x201C;work smarter, not harder&#x201D; kind of industry where the benefits of your results frequently are not a result of how many hours you spent working on them.</p>\n<p>And fourth, maybe the utilitarian in me should be glad that I&#x2019;m getting the same salary, but am able to put more hours into EA projects?</p>\n<p>But all that being said, I think it would be beneficial to me personally if I spent more work on my job, because I think I would learn more in response. Maybe I can start working on learning more parts of the data science industry, such as modeling or devops. ...Or I could get better at big data, such as actually learning how to use Hadoop. I imagine these skills would enhance my future career prospects pretty well.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Day Job: Goals to Accomplish by Next Review</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Get back up to spending 30hrs/wk on my day job.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Learn some data modeling.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stretch goal -- Learn Hadoop.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>EA Direct Work</h2>\n<p>I continue to maintain a large medley of EA projects. I think this is smart, because the only way I can reliably know whether they&#x2019;ll work is to actually do them -- I&#x2019;m not really able to tell in advance.</p>\n<p>To make this a bit more clear, here&#x2019;s a breakdown:</p>\n<div>\n<table>\n<colgroup><col><col><col><col></colgroup> \n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><br></td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Total</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>Per Week</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>% EA</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>EA Survey</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>56.8hrs</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>4.4hrs</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>38.6%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Charity Science</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>22.6</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>1.7</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>15.4%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Birthday for Charity</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>18.5</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>1.4</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>12.6%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Pro-veg Research</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>13.8</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>1.1</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>9.4%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Blogging</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>11.4</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>0.9</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>7.7%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>.impact</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>10.6</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>0.8</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>7.2%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p><span>Other</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>13.3</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>1</span></p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><span>9.1%</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<p><strong>EA Direct: What Went Right</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Charity Science</strong> -- I&#x2019;m pleased to be an early member of <a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com\">Charity Science</a>. I&#x2019;ve been ramping up my involvement with them lately, so the small hours per week isn&#x2019;t really indicative of more recent trends. I&#x2019;ll wait for the official Charity Science three month review to explain our success in more detail, but we&#x2019;ve definitely moved over $100K in 2014 to GiveWell&#x2019;s top charities.</p>\n<p><strong>My personal Birthday for Charity fundraiser</strong> -- I raised over $5K for AMF! I <a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/cs/how_i_raised_501032_for_amf_and_how_you_can_too/\">explain how that happened elsewhere</a>. Giles took those lessons, applied them diligently, and raised over $2K himself. Not bad!</p>\n<p><strong>Pro-veg research</strong> -- Once again, I was given the opportunity to play with far more money than I earned this year, when Jason and I teamed up with <a href=\"http://www.mercyforanimals.org/\">Mercy for Animals</a>&#xA0;to run <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nA3VYi3-UbAOefSWCNcFQQ2fTIceiX1CkyZMIHO-q2Q/edit?usp=sharing\">our study into vegetarian advocacy</a>. The biggest success here is learning delegation, by delegating a lot to Jason and to MFA -- things they would do better than I would! I also managed to delegate some other veg research, such as <a href=\"https://impactresearch.hackpad.com/HumaneSpot-Research-Summary-U8B1Ti0WZTl\">a look into Humane Spot</a>&#xA0;and a study on disguising the intent of vegetarian questionnaires (forthcoming).</p>\n<p><strong>I worked with Tom to <a href=\"https://github.com/tricycle/eaforum/pull/1\">add a feature to this EA forum</a></strong>, the &quot;More Comments&quot; link underneith comments in the sidebar. &#xA0;If you saw how complex the EA Forum codebase is, you&apos;d be impressed too.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>EA Direct: What Went Wrong</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Survey Data Analysis</strong> -- This has been a lesson in the planning fallacy. During my last review, I was convinced that the EA Survey was right around the corner. I was wrong -- I spent nearly 60hrs on it to finish, way more than I expected it would take, but the diligence was important. But then before I could get the final touches done, I hit Thanksgiving, my birthday fundraiser, Christmas, and then New Years, and had no time to get it out the door. It&#x2019;s still sitting there. I&#x2019;m disappointed to not have this done by this review, but I&#x2019;ll definitely have it done by the next one.</p>\n<p><strong>Chicago Skeptics Meetup </strong>-- The Chicago Skeptics have two meetups a month. I went to one in September and promised I&#x2019;d be back to the next one. I never returned&#x2026; to that meetup, or any of the ones over the next four months. I regret that -- I think the networking potential is high, the returns from further testing Charity Science&#x2019;s modeling of targeting skeptics is high, and it was just plain good for me socially.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>EA Direct: Goals to Accomplish by Next Review</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Publish the EA Survey.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Attend at least one more Chicago Skeptics meetup.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Continue to work with Charity Science to test more fundraising ideas, ramping up involvement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Continue to advise MFA on the veg study, but decrease involvement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Decrease involvement in other EA activities and time spent on EA direct work overall.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Entrepreneurship</h2>\n<p>I&#x2019;m still trying to work on some projects to try to bring in money, whether they take the form of &#x201C;passive income&#x201D; projects or potential start-up ideas. I have a long-term goal of eventually replacing my day job income and either (a) making an income cushion so I can do EA projects full-time or (b) creating a rather successful (&gt;$5M in valuation) company.</p>\n<p>Where am I at this goal? September saw the launch of 64or32.com, which has about $6 in recurring monthly revenue (from ads), and which I&#x2019;d value at about $100. Still have a few more zeroes to tack onto that number before I feel successful. But at least it&#x2019;s paid for itself, and I&#x2019;m no longer in the red!</p>\n<p>My business partner and I did a lot of work behind the scenes to bring some other ideas to the MVP stage, and I think we have four potential projects ready to see if they&#x2019;ll get us any money.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Entrepreneurship: What Went Right</strong></p>\n<p>The biggest thing I&#x2019;m excited about so far is our idea generation -- it&#x2019;s greatly surpassed our ability to actually execute, and it means that if our first couple of ideas inevitably fail, we&#x2019;ll have a lot to try next!</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Entrepreneurship: What Went Wrong</strong></p>\n<p>I&#x2019;m still disappointed we didn&#x2019;t actually launch something.</p>\n<p><br><strong> Entrepreneurship: Goals to Accomplish by Next Review</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Launch something.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stretch goal -- launch all four of the projects we think are ready to launch soon.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Stretch goal -- double monthly revenue (sounds impressive until you remember that&#x2019;s bringing us from $6/mo to $12/mo).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Other Things</h2>\n<p><strong>Chinese</strong> -- I&#x2019;m trying to learn Chinese now. It&#x2019;s pretty new -- a goal I started in December. I&#x2019;m mainly doing this because it&#x2019;s fun, though I think there are benefits to learning it. It seems like a generally good skill to have.</p>\n<p><strong>Programming</strong> -- I spent some time outside of work honing my programming skills. I wrote<a href=\"https://github.com/peterhurford/git-it-on.zsh\"><span>Git it on</span></a>, a neat plugin for quickly navigating GitHub from the command line. I wrote <a href=\"https://github.com/peterhurford/git-aliases.zsh\"><span>Git-aliases</span></a>, which is a compilation of aliases for interacting with GitHub more quickly. I also wrote some more R plugins, such as <a href=\"https://github.com/peterhurford/summarizeR\"><span>SummarizeR</span></a>, which generates summary reports of data, and <a href=\"https://github.com/peterhurford/surveytools\"><span>Surveytools</span></a>, a modern, lightweight workflow for analyzing survey data. I&#x2019;d love to work on these more and get them up on <a href=\"http://cran.r-project.org/\">CRAN</a>&#xA0;and <a href=\"/news.ycombinator.com\">Hacker News</a>&#xA0;(goals for the next review).</p>\n<p><strong>Exercise</strong> -- I&#x2019;m disappointed that I&#x2019;m not taking exercise seriously enough, given the large effect it has on happiness, productivity, and well-being (all three things I like). I didn&#x2019;t exercise much Jul-Sep &#x2018;14, and I wanted to turn that around for Oct-Dec &#x2018;14. I succeeded in exercising more (0.4hrs/wk -&gt; 1.4hrs/wk), even buying a pull-up bar, but I&#x2019;m still not where I&#x2019;d like to be. My exercising is still inconsistent, and my weight at 31 Dec 2014 was heavier than it was at 1 Jan 2014. I think as much as I don&#x2019;t like the idea, I need to pony up the money and go to an actual gym and lift actual weights, and double my time spent exercising per week. &#xA0;(Update 3 Jan - going to try to stick to <a href=\"http://peterhurford.tumblr.com/post/107049329111/my-2015-exercise-plan-i-might-be-able-to-stick-to\">this exercise plan</a>.)</p>\n<p><strong>Social</strong> -- I like to socialize with people. This number is high because I had about 20 days (&gt;20% of the review period) where I was on vacation, because our civilization decided to smush the year&#x2019;s three most important holidays together into a block of 36 days. I expect this number to go down for the next review period.</p>\n<p><strong>Sleep and Break</strong> -- These numbers are about as good as they&#x2019;re going to get, and attempting to decrease them further will only be counterproductive. Everyone needs time to recharge. Eight hours of sleep and two hours of break each day still leaves thirteen hours a day to do important stuff, and I certainly have not optimized that yet.</p>\n<p><strong>Prep</strong> -- I&#x2019;m glad that living closer to work has finally brought this number down to something I feel is manageable.</p>\n<p><strong>Planning</strong> -- I spent significantly more time planning Oct-Dec &#x2018;14 than I did in Jul-Sep &#x2018;14. I don&#x2019;t know why that is.</p>\n<p><strong>Email</strong> -- I&#x2019;m spending more time on my email now. I think this is because I do get more email, but I think it&#x2019;s more that I&#x2019;m spending more concentrated periods of time doing emails and multitask less while handling email, so I&#x2019;m more likely to tag time as &#x201C;Email&#x201D;.</p>\n<p><strong>Cleaning</strong> -- I&#x2019;m spending a lot more time cleaning my room now in Oct-Dec &#x2018;14 than Jul-Sep &#x2018;14. It doesn&#x2019;t feel that way, though. I wonder why that is? I imagine that maybe my Jul-Sep &#x2018;14 number wasn&#x2019;t very accurate?</p>\n<p><strong>Moving</strong> -- I&#x2019;m delighted that after spending a ton of time moving in June and September, I finally have a review period where I spent no time moving!</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I find it very hard to make resolutions for the entire year -- I just don&#x2019;t know enough about what my life will be like to plan that far.

Definitions</h1>\n<p>In general, we consider a population to consist of an infinite utility vector <em>(u<sub>0</sub>,u<sub>1</sub>,&#x2026;)</em> where <em>u<sub>i</sub></em> is the aggregate utility of the generation alive at time <em>i</em>. Utility is a <span>bounded</span> real number (the fact that economists assume utility to be bounded confused me for a long time!). Our goal is to find a preference ordering over the set of all utility vectors which is in some sense &#x201C;reasonable&#x201D;. While philosophers have understood for a long time that finding such an ordering is difficult, I will present several theorems which show that it is in fact impossible.</p>\n<p>Due to a lack of latex support I&#x2019;m going to give English-language definitions and results instead of math-ey ones; interested people should look at the papers themselves anyway.</p>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<h1>3.

Possibility Results</h1>\n<p>We&#x2019;ve just shown that it&#x2019;s impossible to construct or even prove the existence of any useful ethical system.

Then X is at least as good as Y. \n<ul>\n<li>Note that this is not a complete ordering! In fact, as per Zame&#x2019;s result above, the set of populations it can meaningfully speak about has measure zero.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Partial translation scale invariance: suppose after some time T, X and Y become the same.

Ordinarily, this is perhaps innocuous, but when the both ideas are highly morally important, their interaction is in turn important &#x2013; many standard arguments on both sides of moral issues like the permissibility of abortion are significantly undermined or otherwise effected by EA considerations, especially moral uncertainty. </em></p>\n<p>A long time ago, Will wrote an article about how a <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/2l6/taking_ideas_seriously/\"><span>key part of rationality was taking ideas seriously</span></a>: fully exploring ideas, seeing all their consequences, and then acting upon them. This is something most of us do not do! I for one certainly have trouble.</p>\n<p>Similarly, I think people selectively apply EA principles. People are very willing to apply them in some cases, but when those principles would cut at a core part of the person&#x2019;s identity &#x2013; <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/lbn/you_have_a_set_amount_of_weirdness_points_spend/\"><span>like requiring them to dress appropriately so they seem less weird</span></a> &#x2013; people are much less willing to take those EA ideas to their logical conclusion.</p>\n<p>Consider your personal views. I&#x2019;ve certainly changed some of my opinions as a result of thinking about EA ideas. For example, my opinion of bednet distribution is now much higher than it once was. And I&#x2019;ve learned a lot about how to think about some technical issues, like <a href=\"/ea/bb/expected_value_estimates_you_can_take_somewhat/\"><span>regression to the mean</span></a>. Yet I realized that I had rarely done a full 180&#xA0; &#x2013; and I think this is true of many people:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Many think EA ideas argue for more foreign aid &#x2013; but did anyone come to this conclusion who had previously been passionately anti-aid?</li>\n<li>Many think EA ideas argue for vegetarianism &#x2013; but did anyone come to this conclusion who had previously been passionately carnivorous?</li>\n<li>Many think EA ideas argue against domestic causes &#x2013; but did anyone come to this conclusion who had previously been a passionate nationalist?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yet this is quite worrying. Given the power and scope of many EA ideas, it seems that they should lead to people changing their mind on issues were they had been previously very certain, and indeed emotionally involved. That they have not suggests we have been <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/gv/outside_the_laboratory/\"><span>compartmentalizing</span></a>.</p>\n<p>Obviously we don&#x2019;t need to apply EA principles to everything &#x2013; we can probably continue to brush our teeth without need for much reflection. But we probably should apply them to issues with are seen as being very important: given the importance of the issues, any implications of EA ideas would probably be important implications.</p>\n<h3>Moral Uncertainty</h3>\n<p>In <a href=\"http://commonsenseatheism.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/MacAskill-Normative-Uncertainty.pdf\"><span>his PhD thesis</span></a>, Will MacAskill argues that we should treat normative uncertainty in much the same way as ordinary positive uncertainty; we should assign credences (probabilities) to each theory, and then try to maximise the expected morality of our actions. He calls this idea &#x2018;maximise expected choice-worthiness&#x2019;, and if you&#x2019;re into philosophy, I recommend reading the paper. As such, when deciding how to act we should give greater weight to the theories we consider more likely to be true, and also give more weight to theories that consider the issue to be of greater importance.</p>\n<p>This is important because it means that a novel view does not have to be totally persuasive to demand our observance. Consider, for example, vegetarianism. Maybe you think there&#x2019;s only a 10% chance that animal welfare is morally significant &#x2013; you&#x2019;re pretty sure they&#x2019;re tasty for a reason. Yet if the consequences of eating meat are very bad in those 10% of cases (murder or torture, if the animal rights activists are correct), and the advantages are not very great in the other 90% (tasty, some nutritional advantages), we should not eat meat regardless. Taking into account the size of the issue at stake as well as probability of its being correct means paying more respect to &#x2018;minority&#x2019; theories.</p>\n<p>And this is more of an issue for EAs than for most people. Effective Altruism involves a group of novel moral premisses, like <a href=\"http://ea-forum.trikeapps.com/ea/6w/cosmopolitanism/\"><span>cosmopolitanism</span></a>, <a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/70/the_moral_imperative_towards_costeffectiveness/\"><span>the moral imperative for cost-effectiveness</span></a> and <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2013/07/17/beckstead-interview/\"><span>the importance of the far future</span></a>. Each of these imply that our decisions are in some way very important, so even if we assign them only a small credence, their plausibility implies radical revisions to our actions.</p>\n<p>One issue that Will touches on in his thesis is the issue of whether fetuses morally count. In the same way that we have moral uncertainty as to whether animals, or people in the far future, count, so too we have moral uncertainty as to whether unborn children are morally significant. Yes, many people are confident they know the correct answer &#x2013; but there many of these on each side of the issue. Given the degree of disagreement on the issue, among <a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1988647\"><span>philosophers</span></a>, politicians and the general public, it seems like the perfect example of an issue where moral uncertainty should be taken into account &#x2013; indeed Will uses it as a canonical example.</p>\n<p>Consider the case of a pregnant women Sarah, wondering whether it is morally permissible to abort her child<sup><a href=\"https://effectivereaction.wordpress.com/?p=160&amp;preview=true#fn-160-1\">1</a></sup>. The alternative course of action she is considering is putting the child up for adoption. In accordance with the level of social and philosophical debate on the issue, she is uncertain as to whether aborting the fetus is morally permissible. If it&#x2019;s morally permissible, it&#x2019;s <em>merely</em> permissible &#x2013; it&#x2019;s not obligatory. She follows the example from <em>Normative Uncertainty</em> and constructs the following table</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://effectivereaction.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/abortion-table-1.png\"><img src=\"https://effectivereaction.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/abortion-table-1.png?w=334&amp;h=107\" alt=\"abortion table 1\"></a></p>\n<p>In the best case scenario, abortion has nothing to recommend it, as adoption is also permissible. In the worst case, abortion is actually impermissible, whereas adoption is permissible. As such, adoption <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategic_dominance\"><span>dominates</span></a> abortion.</p>\n<p>However, Sarah might not consider this representation as adequate. In particular, she thinks that now is not the best time to have a child, and would prefer to avoid it.<sup><a href=\"https://effectivereaction.wordpress.com/?p=160&amp;preview=true#fn-160-2\">2</a></sup> She has made plans which are inconsistent with being pregnant, and prefers not to give birth at the current time. So she amends the table to take into account these preferences.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://effectivereaction.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/abortion-table-2.png\"><img src=\"https://effectivereaction.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/abortion-table-2.png?w=300&amp;h=107\" alt=\"abortion table 2\"></a></p>\n<p>Now adoption no longer strictly dominates abortion, because she prefers abortion to adoption in the scenario where it is morally permissible. As such, she considers her credence: she considers the pro-choice arguments slightly more persuasive than the pro-life ones: she assigns a 70% credence to abortion being morally permissible, but only a 30% chance to its being morally impermissible.</p>\n<p>Looking at the table with these numbers in mind, intuitively it seems that again it&#x2019;s not worth the risk of abortion: a 70% chance of saving oneself inconvenience and temporary discomfort is not sufficient to justify a 30% chance of committing murder. But Sarah&#x2019;s unsatisfied with this unscientific comparison: it doesn&#x2019;t seem to have much of a theoretical basis, and she distrusts appeals to intuitions in cases like this. What is more, Sarah is something of a utilitarian; she doesn&#x2019;t really believe in something being impermissible.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, there&#x2019;s a standard tool for making inter-personal welfare comparisons: QALYs. We can convert the previous table into QALYs, with the moral uncertainty now being expressed as uncertainty as to whether saving fetuses generates QALYs. If it does, then it generates a lot; supposing she&#x2019;s at the end of her first trimester, if she doesn&#x2019;t abort the baby it has a <a href=\"http://spacefem.com/pregnant/mc.php?m=08&amp;d=10&amp;y=12\"><span>98% chance of surviving to birth</span></a>, at which point its <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/fastats/life-expectancy.htm\"><span>life expectancy is 78.7 in the US</span></a>, for 78.126 QALYs. This calculation assumes assigns no QALYs to the fetus&#x2019;s 6 months of existence between now and birth. If fetuses are not worthy of ethical consideration, then it accounts for 0 QALYs.</p>\n<p>We also need to assign QALYs to Sarah. For an upper bound, being pregnant is probably not much worse than having both your legs amputated without medication, which is <a href=\"/ea/7g/disability_weights/\"><span>0.494 QALYs</span></a>, so lets conservatively say 0.494 QALYs. She has an expected 6 months of pregnancy remaining, so we divide by 2 to get 0.247 QALYs. Women&#x2019;s Health Magazine gives the odds of maternal death during childbirth at <a href=\"http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/women-dying-in-childbirth\"><span>0.03% for 2013</span></a>; we&#x2019;ll round up to 0.05% to take into account risk of non-death injury. Women at 25 have a remaining life expectancy of <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/hus/hus11.pdf#fig32\"><span>around 58 years</span></a>, so thats 0.05%*58= 0.029 QALYs. In total that gives us an estimate of 0.276 QALYs. If the baby doesn&#x2019;t survive to birth, however, some of these costs will not be incurred, so the truth is probably slightly lower than this. All in all a 0.276 QALYs seems like a reasonably conservative figure.</p>\n<p>Obviously you could refine these numbers a lot (for example, years of old age are likely to be at lower quality of life, there are some medical risks to the mother from aborting a fetus, etc.) but they&#x2019;re plausibly in the right ballpark. They would also change if we used inherent temporal discounting, but probably <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/n2/against_discount_rates/\"><span>we shouldn&#x2019;t</span></a>.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://effectivereaction.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/abortion-table-3.png\"><img src=\"https://effectivereaction.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/abortion-table-3.png?w=291&amp;h=93\" alt=\"abortion table 3\"></a></p>\n<p>We can then take into account her moral uncertainty directly, and calculate the expected QALYs of each action:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If she aborts the fetus, our expected QALYs are 70%<em>x0 + 30%</em>(-78.126) = -23.138</li>\n<li>If she carries the baby to term and puts it up for adoption, our expected QALYs are 70%<em>(-0.247) + 30%</em>(-0.247) = -0.247</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Which again suggests that the moral thing to do is to not abort the baby. Indeed, the life expectancy is so long at birth that it quite easily dominates the calculation: Sarah would have to be extremely confident in rejecting the value of the fetus to justify aborting it. So, mindful of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overconfidence_effect\"><span>overconfidence bias</span></a>, she decides to carry the child to term.</p>\n<p>Indeed, we can show just how confident in the lack of moral significance of the fetuses one would have to be to justify aborting one. Here is a sensitivity table, showing credence in moral significance of fetuses on the y axis, and the direct QALY cost of pregnancy on the x axis for a wide range of possible values. The direct QALY cost of pregnancy is obviously bounded above by its limited duration. As is immediately apparent, one has to be very confident in fetuses lacking moral significance, and pregnancy has to be very bad, before aborting a fetus becomes even slightly QALY-positive. For moderate values, it is extremely QALY-negative.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://effectivereaction.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/abortion-table-4.png\"><img src=\"https://effectivereaction.files.wordpress.com/2014/12/abortion-table-4.png?w=420&amp;h=175\" alt=\"abortion table 4\"></a></p>\n<h3>Other EA concepts and their applications to this issue</h3>\n<p>Of course, moral uncertainty is not the only EA principle that could have bearing on the issue, and given that the theme of this blogging carnival, and this post, is things we&#x2019;re overlooking, it would be remiss not to give at least a broad overview of some of the others. Here, I don&#x2019;t intend to judge how persuasive any given argument is &#x2013; as we discussed above, this is a debate that has been going without settlement for thousands of years &#x2013; but merely to show the ways that common EA arguments affect the plausibility of the different arguments. This is a section about the directionality of EA concerns, not on the overall magnitudes.</p>\n<h4>Not really people</h4>\n<p>One of the most important arguments for the permissibility of abortion is that fetuses are in some important sense &#x2018;not really people&#x2019;. In many ways this argument resembles the anti-animal rights argument that animals are also &#x2018;not really people&#x2019;. We already covered above the way that considerations of moral uncertainty undermine both these arguments, but it&#x2019;s also noteworthy that in general it seems that the two views are mutually supporting (or mutually undermining, if both are false). Animal-rights advocates often appeal to the idea of an &#x2018;expanding circle&#x2019; of moral concern. I&#x2019;m <a href=\"http://www.gwern.net/The%20Narrowing%20Circle\"><span>skeptical of such an argument</span></a>, but it seems clear that the larger your sphere, the more likely fetuses are to end up on the inside. The fact that, in the US at least, animal activists tend to be pro-abortion seems to be more of a historical accident than anything else. We could imagine alternative-universe political coalitions, where a &#x201C;Defend the Weak; They&#x2019;re morally valuable too&#x201D; party faced off against a &#x201C;Exploit the Weak; They just don&#x2019;t count&#x201D; party. In general, to the extent that EAs care about animal suffering (even <a href=\"http://reducing-suffering.org/do-bugs-feel-pain/\"><span>insect suffering</span></a> ), EAs should tend to be concerned about the welfare of the unborn.</p>\n<h4>Not people yet</h4>\n<p>A slightly different common argument is that while fetuses will eventually be people, they&#x2019;re not people yet. Since they&#x2019;re not people right now, we don&#x2019;t have to pay any attention to their rights or welfare right now. Indeed, many people make short sighted decisions that implicitly assign very little value to the futures of people currently alive, or even to their own futures &#x2013; through self-destructive drug habits, or simply failing to save for retirement. If we don&#x2019;t assign much value to our own futures, it seems very sensible to disregard the futures of those not even born. And even if people who disregarded their own futures were simply negligent, we might still be concerned about things like the <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nonidentity-problem/\"><span>non-identity problem</span></a>.</p>\n<p>Yet it seems that EAs are almost uniquely unsuited to this response. EAs do tend to care explicitly about future generations. We put considerable resources into investigating how to help them, whether through addressing <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog/2013-08-08/less-burn-for-your-buck-which-climate-charities-are-most-effective-in-reducing\"><span>climate change</span></a> or <a href=\"http://www.existential-risk.org/concept.pdfbostrom\"><span>existential risks</span></a>. And yet these people have far less of a claim to current personhood than fetuses, who at least have current physical form, even if it is diminutive. So again to the extent that EAs care about future welfare, EAs should tend to be concerned about the welfare of the unborn.</p>\n<h4>Replaceability</h4>\n<p>Another important EA idea is that of <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/replaceability\"><span>replaceability</span></a>. Typically this arises in contexts of career choice, but there is a different application here. The QALYs associated with aborted children might not be so bad if the mother will go on to have another child instead. If she does, the net QALY loss is much lower than the gross QALY loss. Of course, the benefits of aborting the fetus are equivalently much smaller &#x2013; if she has a child later on instead, she will have to bear the costs of pregnancy eventually anyway. This resembles concerns that maybe <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2014/04/17/david-roodmans-draft-writeup-on-the-mortality-fertility-connection/\"><span>saving children in Africa doesn&#x2019;t make much difference, because their parents adjust their subsequent fertility.</span></a></p>\n<p>The plausibility behind this idea comes from the idea that, at least in the US, most families have a certain ideal number of children in mind, and basically achieve this goal. As such, missing an opportunity to have an early child simply results in having another later on.</p>\n<p>If this were fully true, utilitarians might decide that abortion actually has no QALY impact at all &#x2013; all it does is change the timing of events. On the other hand, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_and_female_fertility\"><span>fertility declines with age</span></a>, so many couples planning to have a replacement child later may be unable to do so. Also, some people do not have ideal family size plans.</p>\n<p>Additionally, this does not really seem to hold when the alternative is adoption; presumably a woman putting a child up for adoption does not consider it as part of her family, so her future childbearing would be unaffected. This argument might hold if raising the child yourself was the only alternative, but given that adoption services are available, it does not seem to go through.</p>\n<h4>Autonomy</h4>\n<p>Sometimes people argue for the permissibility of abortion through autonomy arguments. &#x201C;It is my body&#x201D;, such an argument would go, &#x201C;therefore I may do whatever I want with it.&#x201D; To a certain extent this argument is addressed by pointing out that one&#x2019;s bodily rights presumably do not extent to killing others, so if the anti-abortion side are correct, or even have a non-trivial probability of being correct, autonomy would be insufficient. It seems that if the autonomy argument is to work, it must be because a different argument has established the non-personhood of fetuses &#x2013; in which case the autonomy argument is redundant. Yet even putting this aside, this argument is less appealing to EAs than to non-EAs, because EAs often hold a distinctly non-libertarian account of personal ethics. We believe it is actually good to help people (and avoid hurting them), and perhaps that it is bad to avoid doing so. And many EAs are utilitarians, for whom helping/not-hurting is not merely laud-worthy but actually compulsory. EAs are generally not very impressed with <a href=\"http://aynrandlexicon.com/lexicon/abortion.html\"><span>Ayn Rand style autonomy arguments</span></a> for rejecting charity, so again EAs should tend to be unsympathetic to autonomy arguments for the permissibility of abortion.</p>\n<p>Indeed, some EAs even think we should be legally obliged to act in good ways, whether through laws against factory farming or tax-funded foreign aid.</p>\n<h4>Deontology</h4>\n<p>An argument often used on the opposite side&#xA0; &#x2013; that is, an argument used to oppose abortion, is that abortion is murder, and murder is simply always wrong. Whether because <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_shall_not_murder\"><span>God commanded it</span></a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kantian_ethics\"><span>Kant derived it</span></a>, we should place the utmost importance of never murdering. I&#x2019;m not sure that any EA principle <em>directly</em> pulls against this, but nonetheless most EAs are consequentialists, who believe that all values can be compared. If aborting one child would save a million others, most EAs would probably endorse the abortion. So I think this is one case where a common EA view pulls in favor of the permissibility of abortion.</p>\n<h4>I didn&#x2019;t ask for this</h4>\n<p>Another argument often used for the permissibility of abortion is that the situation is in some sense unfair. If one did not intend to become pregnant &#x2013; perhaps even took precautions to avoid becoming so &#x2013; but nonetheless ends up pregnant, you&#x2019;re in some way not responsible for becoming pregnant. And since you&#x2019;re not responsible for it you have no obligations concerning it &#x2013; so may permissible abort the fetus.</p>\n<p>However, once again this runs counter to a major strand of EA thought. Most of us did not ask to be born in rich countries, or to be intelligent, or hardworking. Perhaps it was simply luck. Yet being in such a position nonetheless means we have certain opportunities and obligations. Specifically, we have the opportunity to use of wealth to significantly aid those less fortunate than ourselves in the developing world, and many EAs would agree the obligation. So EAs seem to reject the general idea that not intending a situation relieves one of the responsibilities of that situation.</p>\n<h4>Infanticide is okay too</h4>\n<p>A frequent argument against the permissibility of aborting fetuses is by analogy to infanticide. In general <a href=\"http://www.gwern.net/An%20Abortion%20Dialogue\"><span>it is hard to produce a coherent criteria that permits the killing of babies before birth but forbids it after birth</span></a>. For most people, this is a reasonably compelling objection: murdering innocent babies is clearly evil! Yet some EAs actually <a href=\"http://www.utilitarian.net/singer/by/1993----.htm\"><span>endorse infanticide</span></a>. If you were one of those people, this particular argument would have little sway over you.</p>\n<h4>Moral Universalism</h4>\n<p>A common implicit premise in many moral discussion is that the same moral principles apply to everyone. When Sarah did her QALY calculation, she counted the baby&#x2019;s QALYs as equally important to her own in the scenario where they counted at all. Similarly, both sides of the debate assume that whatever the answer is, it will apply fairly broadly. Perhaps permissibility varies by age of the fetus &#x2013; maybe ending <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fetal_viability#Scientific_thresholds\"><span>when viability hits</span></a> &#x2013; but the same answer will apply to rich and poor, Christian and Jew, etc.</p>\n<p>This is something some EAs might reject. Yes, saving the baby produces many more QALYs than Sarah loses through the pregnancy, and that would be the end of the story if Sarah were simply an ordinary person. But Sarah is an EA, and so has a much higher opportunity cost for her time. Becoming pregnant will undermine her career as an investment banker, the argument would go, which in turn prevents her from donating to AMF and saving a great many lives. Because of this, Sarah is in a special position &#x2013; it is permissible for her, but it would not be permissible for someone who wasn&#x2019;t saving many lives a year.</p>\n<p>I think this is a pretty repugnant attitude in general, and a particularly objectionable instance of it, but I include it here for completeness.</p>\n<h3>May we discuss this?</h3>\n<p>Now we&#x2019;ve considered these arguments, it appears that applying general EA principles to the issue in general tends to make abortion look less morally permissible, though there were one or two exceptions. But there is also a second order issue that we should perhaps address &#x2013; is it permissible to discuss this issue at all?</p>\n<h4>Nothing to do with you</h4>\n<p>A frequently seen argument on this issue is to claim that <a href=\"http://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/i-helped-shut-down-an-abortion-debate-between-two-men-because-my-uterus-isnt-up-for-their-discussion-9867200.html\"><span>the speaker has no right to opine on the issue</span></a>. If it doesn&#x2019;t personally affect you, you cannot discuss it &#x2013; especially if you&#x2019;re privileged. As many (a majority?) of EAs are male, and of the women many are not pregnant, this would curtail dramatically the ability of EAs to discuss abortion. This is not so much an argument on one side or other of the issue as an argument for silence.</p>\n<p>Leaving aside the inherent virtues and vices of this argument, it is not very suitable for EAs. Because EAs have many many opinions on topics that don&#x2019;t directly affect them:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>EAs have opinions on disease in Africa, yet most have never been to Africa, and never will</li>\n<li>EAs have opinions on (non-human) animal suffering, yet most are not non-human animals</li>\n<li>EAs have opinions on the far future, yet live in the present</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Indeed, EAs seem <em>more</em> qualified to comment on abortion &#x2013; as we all were once fetuses, and many of us will become pregnant. If taken seriously this argument would call foul on virtually ever EA activity! And this is no idle fantasy &#x2013; there are certainly some people who think that <a href=\"http://www.dambisamoyo.com/books-and-publications/book/dead-aid/\"><span>Westerns cannot usefully contribute to solving African poverty</span></a>.</p>\n<h4>Too controversial</h4>\n<p>We can safely say this is a somewhat controversial issue. Perhaps it is too controversial &#x2013; maybe it is bad for the movement to discuss. One might accept the arguments above &#x2013; that EA principles generally undermine the traditional reasons for thinking abortion is morally permissible &#x2013; yet think we should not talk about it. The controversy might divide the community and undermine trust. Perhaps it might deter newcomers. I&#x2019;m somewhat sympathetic to this argument &#x2013; I take the <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/14/the-virtue-of-silence/\"><span>virtue of silence</span></a> seriously, though eventually my boyfriend persuaded me it was worth publishing.</p>\n<p>Note that the controversial nature is evidence <em>against</em> abortion&#x2019;s moral permissibility, due to moral uncertainty.</p>\n<p>However, the EA movement is no stranger to controversy.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There is a semi-official EA position on immigration, which is about as controversial as abortion in the US at the moment, and the EA position is such an extreme position that essentially no mainstream politicians hold it.</li>\n<li>There is a semi-official EA position on vegetarianism, which is pretty controversial too, as it involves implying that the majority of Americans are complicit in murder every day.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Not worthy of discussion</h4>\n<p>Finally, another objection to discussing this is it simply it&#x2019;s an EA idea. There are many disagreements in the world, yet there is no need for an EA view on each. Conflict between the Lilliputians and Blefuscudians notwithstanding, there is no need for an EA perspective on which end of the egg to break first. And we should be especially careful of heated, emotional topics with less avenue to <a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2007/05/policy_tugowar.html\"><span>pull the rope sideways</span></a>. As such, even though the object-level arguments given above are correct, we should simply decline to discuss it.</p>\n<p>However, it seems that if abortion is a moral issue, it is a very large one. In the same way that the sheer number of QALYs lost makes abortion worse than adoption even if our credence in fetuses having moral significance was very low, the large number of abortions occurring each year make the issue as a whole of high significance. In 2011 there were <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/psrh.46e0414.pdf\"><span>over 1 million babies were aborted in the US</span></a>. I&#x2019;ve seen a wide range of global estimates, including <a href=\"http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/wrjp3313.html\">around 10 million</a> to <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/Abortion-Worldwide.pdf\"><span>over 40 million</span></a>. By contrast, the WHO estimates there are <a href=\"http://www.who.int/gho/malaria/epidemic/deaths/en/\"><span>fewer than 1 million malaria deaths worldwide</span></a> each year. Abortion deaths also cause a higher loss of QALYs due to the young age at which they occur. On the other hand, we should discount them for the uncertainty that they are morally significant. And perhaps there is <a href=\"http://www.amirrorclear.net/academic/papers/scourge.pdf\"><span>an even larger closely related moral issue</span></a>. The size of the issue is not the only <a href=\"/ea/cr/factoring_costeffectiveness/\"><span>factor</span></a> in estimating the cost-effectiveness of interventions, but it is the most easily estimable. On the other hand, I have little idea how many dollars of donations it takes to save a fetus &#x2013; it seems like an excellent example of some low-hanging fruit research.</p>\n<h3>Conclusion</h3>\n<p>People frequently compartmentalize their beliefs, and avoid addressing the implications between them. Ordinarily, this is perhaps innocuous, but when the both ideas are highly morally important, their interaction is in turn important. In this post we the implications of common EA beliefs on the permissibility of abortion. Taking into account moral uncertainty makes aborting a fetus seem far less permissible, as the high counterfactual life expectancy of the baby tends to dominate other factors. Many other EA views are also significant to the issue, making various standard arguments on each side less plausible.</p>\n<div>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li> There doesn&#x2019;t seem to be any neutral language one can use here, so I&#x2019;m just going to switch back and forth between &#x2018;fetus&#x2019; and &#x2018;child&#x2019; or &#x2018;baby&#x2019; in a vain attempt at terminological neutrality.&#xA0; </li>\n<li> I chose this reason because it is the <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/3711005.pdf\"><span>most frequently cited main motivation for aborting a fetus</span></a> according to the Guttmacher Institute.&#xA0; </li>\n</ol></div></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Dale"}}, {"_id": "mKGWZYnDPPj8njCiZ", "title": "EAs on RSS and Reddit!", "postedAt": "2014-12-31T17:08:56.986Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>This EA Forum is great. &#xA0;But there&apos;s EA discussion elsewhere. &#xA0;Previously, <a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/bi/effective_altruism_blogs/\">we made a list of EA blogs</a>. &#xA0;Now these blogs are available via RSS!</p>\n<p>Here&apos;s the feed:&#xA0;http://www.rssmix.com/u/7116781/rss.xml</p>\n<p>Here are the feeds I&apos;ve included so far:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/\">This EA Forum</a>&#xA0;(<a href=\"/.rss\">Feed</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/\">GiveWell&apos;s Blog</a> (<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheGivewellBlog?format=xml\">Feed</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/blog/\">80K&apos;s Research Blog</a> (<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/feed/\">Feed</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://givingwhatwecan.org/blog\">Giving What We Can&apos;s blog</a> (<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/blog.xml\">Feed</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Blog.aspx\">The Life You Can Save</a> (<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/TheLifeYouCanSave?format=xml\">Feed</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/\">Giving Gladly</a> (<a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/feeds/posts/default?alt=rss\">Feed</a>)</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net\">Ben Kuhn on Altruism</a> (<a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/rss/effective-altruism\">Feed</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n<div>If you think I should include or remove a blog, please let me know!</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<h2><strong>r/smartgiving</strong></h2>\n<div>Also, if you&apos;re looking for an EA Reddit experience, this RSS feed is <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/myrecipes/personal/8490303\">automatically posted</a> to the <a href=\"http://www.reddit.com/r/smartgiving\">r/smartgiving subreddit</a>! &#xA0;Magic!</div>\n<div><br>We&apos;ve just crossed 1K readers, so now&apos;s a cool time to check it out.</div></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Peter_Hurford"}}, {"_id": "7oEMDW8gSZ4DTpg8d", "title": "The perspectives on effective altruism we don't hear", "postedAt": "2014-12-30T12:04:55.169Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><em>This is my contribution to the December blogging carnival on &quot;blind spots.&quot;</em></p>\n<p>If I&#x2019;d heard about effective altruism in different circumstances, I think I could have reacted quite negatively to the whole concept. If I&#x2019;d been introduced to the idea of effective altruism by a friend who put a slightly negative spin on it, saying it was cold or overly demanding or something, I can totally imagine myself forming a negative impression. I&#x2019;d be surprised if I were the only person for whom this were true.</p>\n<p>Perhaps we should be thinking more about how the ideas of effective altruism might be - and are being - perceived by different people, to ensure that people like me don&#x2019;t end up being put off. It&#x2019;s not that we don&#x2019;t spend any time thinking about this - there&#x2019;s certainly a fair amount of talk about how to &#x201C;pitch&#x201D; or &#x201C;frame&#x201D; effective altruism and giving. But most of this discussion is internal - just a bunch of people who are already convinced by EA talking about how it might be perceived. As objective as we can try to be, there&#x2019;s obviously a massive selection bias here.</p>\n<h2>The opinions we don&#x2019;t hear</h2>\n<p>My friend <a href=\"/www.uribram.com\">Uri Bram</a> recently wrote a great little article for Quartz called &#x201C; <a href=\"http://qz.com/290784/the-most-important-person-at-your-company-doesnt-work-for-you/\"> The most important person at your company doesn&#x2019;t work for you </a> .&#x201D; He makes the following point: the people who stay working at your company are a very non-random sample of all the people who could possibly work for you, obviously - they&#x2019;re likely to be those who feel most positively about the company. This means that if you only seek feedback from your current employees, you&#x2019;ll likely get the impression that things are going pretty much fine. It&#x2019;s the people who left the company, or who never applied in the first place, who are most likely to have useful information about the company&#x2019;s shortcomings.</p>\n<p>I think the same point applies to the EA movement. If we want to really get an accurate picture of the shortcomings and possible failure modes of the movement, we need to do more than talk about it ourselves (although this is certainly useful.) We also need to actively seek out feedback from people who aren&#x2019;t already convinced by EA, people who have a negative impression of EA, or perhaps people who were initially interested but were put off by something, or just didn&#x2019;t get more involved. I can think of plenty of people like this myself, and yet I&#x2019;m not spending much time asking for their opinions and considering them as valuable, relevant feedback.</p>\n<p>Maybe you&#x2019;re already doing this much more than me - I&#x2019;m sure some people are, and that&#x2019;s great. But I also think it&#x2019;s not something we&#x2019;ve prioritised or talked much about explicitly as a group. This is surprising, in a way - seeking negative feedback is such an obviously useful thing. So why aren&#x2019;t we doing this more?</p>\n<h2>Valuing feedback isn&#x2019;t enough</h2>\n<p>One possible explanation is just that seeking criticism is a psychologically difficult thing to do. I think this is definitely at least part of what&#x2019;s going on. Most effective altruists I know really value feedback and criticism - much more than the average person - and are much better at seeking feedback than most as a result. But we&#x2019;re all still human, and so for most of us, having our beliefs challenged still feels unpleasant sometimes. It feels especially unpleasant when it comes to issues that are close to your identity or social group - which is certainly the case for many with effective altruism.</p>\n<p>Another, related problem is that it&#x2019;s easy to immediately write off people who react negatively to EA as &#x201C;just not like us.&#x201D; This isn&#x2019;t an explicit thing, but it can happen implicitly - I&#x2019;ve noticed myself thinking something like this. Someone criticises some element of effective altruism and I&#x2019;ll find myself writing their comment off with a thought like &#x201C;they just don&#x2019;t really get it&#x201D;, or &#x201C;they&#x2019;re biased because x&#x201D;, or &#x201C;they&#x2019;re not really the kind of person we&#x2019;d expect to be interested.&#x201D; I&#x2019;ve had some fairly heated discussions with my parents about the GWWC pledge, for example - they don&#x2019;t particularly like the idea of me donating a substantial proportion of my earnings right now for various reasons. When we initially had these conversations, I mostly wrote off their comments as &#x201C;them just not getting it&#x201D; at best, and &#x201C;them being crazy unreasonable&#x201D; at worst. It&#x2019;s only recently that I&#x2019;ve started to see these conversations as a useful piece of feedback - both a different perspective on how I should prioritise my spending, and on how certain ideas might be off-putting to others. This doesn&#x2019;t mean I have to agree with them, but I do now see that their perspective is useful for me to understand.</p>\n<p>Rejecting something someone else says with &#x201C;they don&#x2019;t get it&#x201D; or &#x201C;they&#x2019;re being unreasonable&#x201D; is essentially a defensive reaction. What this misses is that every piece of feedback - no matter how it&#x2019;s framed or where it comes from - contains useful information.</p>\n<p>Finally, actively seeking out feedback from others - especially those who aren&#x2019;t immediately within our social circle - can just be effortful. Even if you know that seeking feedback is a good idea and you&#x2019;re not actively avoiding it, it takes time and effort to actually go and ask questions, think about different perspectives, and to extract useful information from it. These conversations can also be awkward or lead to conflict. A big part of the reason I don&#x2019;t always talk to my family and friends about effective altruism is that I don&#x2019;t want to seem like I&#x2019;m preaching, or get into a heated discussion.</p>\n<h2>How can we obtain more varied perspectives on effective altruism?</h2>\n<p>So what can we do, practically speaking, to reduce this selection effect and get more useful information about where the EA movement be going wrong? A few ideas:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> <strong>See casual conversations with friends and family as an opportunity to learn about their perspective</strong> . If someone you&#x2019;re talking to isn&#x2019;t immediately taken in by an idea you&#x2019;re telling them about, it&#x2019;s natural to think you can either switch topic or try harder to persuade them. But there&#x2019;s a third option: you could try to better understand what their perspective is on what you&#x2019;re saying, and why it might not appeal to them. You might not agree with their perspective, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean it&#x2019;s not useful. It&#x2019;s still their reaction, and others might have a similar one - and it&#x2019;s valuable for the effective altruism movement to see where these perspectives are coming from. </li>\n<li> <strong>Making more effort to understand the perspectives of those who are critical of effective altruism</strong> - people who write critical pieces online or argue in Facebook comments, for example. It&#x2019;s so natural to get on the defensive in these situations, but it&#x2019;s also so valuable to take a step back and ask: what is making them think or feel this way? Why does what I&#x2019;m saying seem wrong or triggering to them? How might their beliefs and values differ from mine to make this the case? </li>\n<li> <strong>Actively seeking out feedback from people who seem to have a negative or not-entirely-positive view of effective altruism</strong> . This could include a range of people: friends and family, those who have spoken out publicly in criticism, or perhaps people who we might expect to be aligned with effective altruism but don&#x2019;t appear that interested - there are a number of academics and public figures who might fit this description that it could be really valuable to talk to. </li>\n<li> <strong>Doing online studies and surveys to get more data on how people react to different framings of effective altruism</strong> . As I said at the beginning of this post, the way that messages are framed can make a massive difference to how people react to them. I think there&#x2019;s still a lot that we could learn about how people respond to different ways of talking about effective altruism, and the kinds of people who find the ideas most appealing. Running studies online is one way we could get a lot of information on this at relatively low cost. </li>\n</ol>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>I&apos;d be interested in what others think - whether we should be focusing on getting more diverse perspectives, and, if so, what the best strategies for doing that are.</div></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Jess_Whittlestone"}}, {"_id":

from the <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/lfg/cfar_in_2014_continuing_to_climb_out_of_the/\">Center for Applied Rationality</a>, an organisation who among its other goals, aims to improve the capabilities of effective altruists.</p>\n<p>On the 2014 costs, their Executive Director Anna says:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>Our total expenditures in 2014 came up about $840k...&#xA0;</span><span>We ran 9 workshops in 2014, which generated about $435k in revenue, but also $210k in non-staff costs...&#xA0;</span><span>Our basic operating expenses from 2014 were fairly

We were covered in Fast Company -- twice -- the Wall Street Journal, and The Reasoner. Other mentions include Forbes, Big Think, Boing Boing, and Lifehacker. We&#x2019;ve also had some interest in potential training for tech companies. Our curriculum is gaining a second tier in the form of alumni workshops.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>On ongoing aims:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<div>&quot;CFAR seems to many of us to be among the efforts most worth investing in. &#xA0;This isn&#x2019;t because our present workshops are all that great. &#xA0;Rather, it is because, in terms of &#x201C;saving throws&#x201D; one can buy for a humanity that may be navigating tricky situations in an unknown future, improvements to thinking skill seem to be one of the strongest and most robust. &#xA0;And we suspect that CFAR is a promising kernel from which to help with that effort.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>As noted, we aim in 2015 to get all the way to a &#x201C;full prototype&#x201D; -- &#xA0;a point from which we are actually visibly helping in the aimed-for way. &#xA0;This will be a tricky spot to get to. Our experience slowly coming to grips with epistemic rationality is probably more rule than the exception, and I suspect we&#x2019;ll run into a number of curve balls on path to the prototype.&quot;</div>\n</blockquote>\n<div>All of these are covered in a bunch more detail in the <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/lfg/cfar_in_2014_continuing_to_climb_out_of_the/\">full article</a>.</div></body></html>", "user": {"username": "RyanCarey"}}, {"_id": "E4JJCbAh5KyHcbGym", "title": "The Impact you can (and can't) Make in an Hour", "postedAt": "2014-12-26T02:07:13.504Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>This is my contribution to this month&apos;s blogging carnival, with the theme of &quot;blind spots&quot;.</p>\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"http://benkuhn.net\">Ben Kuhn</a> for substantial help organizing and editing this post.</p>\n<p>There&apos;s a trope in the EA world of comparing every activity to spending the same amount of time working and donating the money earned to charity. &#xA0;The implication is that one shouldn&apos;t do any potentially charitable activities unless they meet this extremely high standard. &#xA0;Some examples:</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Eliezer uses a canonical example from economics of a <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/65/money_the_unit_of_caring/\">lawyer who volunteers in a soup kitchen</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/ay/kidney_donation_is_a_reasonable_choice_for/\">Kidney donation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/ba/when_should_an_effective_altruist_be_vegetarian/\">Vegetarianism</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"/ea/b2/open_thread_5/1gd\">Voting</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>This naive hour-for-hour comparison adequately captures the actual consequences of decisions that trade off time, and as I&apos;ll discuss in this post, I think they unfairly discourage us from using our time other ways. &#xA0;We need ways to make decisions about how we spend our time that take into account how we&apos;re spending our time overall, not just any particular hour.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Why the naive hour-for-hour tradeoff model doesn&apos;t work</h2>\n<p><strong>Non-linear return on work</strong></p>\n<p>These comparisons assume that return on work is linear, that is, the marginal hour at work is worth the same amount of money as the average hour at work. &#xA0;This isn&#x2019;t usually true. &#xA0;People who earn salaries usually earn their salary as long as they fulfil the minimum requirements for their job. &#xA0;Even if working more than the minimum helps you earn more, there&apos;s no reason to think that it does so at the same rate.</p>\n<p>For a clear example, consider a teacher. &#xA0;They earn $40,000 a year and have 12 weeks off during the summer, so their wage for the 40 weeks that school is on is $1,000/week. &#xA0;During the summer, they can try to get a second job, but they probably can&apos;t do better than $10/hour, bringing them to $400/week during the summer. &#xA0;Since teacher salaries are usually based on seniority and not skill, putting extra time into school-related things probably doesn&apos;t pay off monetarily. &#xA0;Even though the average wage is about $860/week, their marginal income is more like $400/week. &#xA0;The comparisons above, then, give twice the lost income a teacher could reasonably expect from a lost hour of work.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>What if I&apos;m a software engineer? &#xA0;Since working more in tech probably helps you primarily by increasing the probability that you are promoted, it&apos;s harder to estimate your expected reward. &#xA0;Some considerations:</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Raises in the tech industry are usually small; you usually increase your pay only by switching jobs.</li>\n<li>If you work hard and climb the tech career ladder faster, you enjoy higher salaries for longer, multiplying the effect of your work.</li>\n<li>Tech salaries have a long tail. &#xA0;If you end up the CTO of a successful company, you make a lot of money, but very few people achieve that. &#xA0;One thing this means is that moving from the 60th percentile of tech workers to the 65th is probably much less valuable than moving from the 94th to the 99th.</li>\n<li>It&#x2019;s also probably much easier to move from the 60th percentile of tech workers to the 65th than from the 94th to the 99th, because the other people in the 94th percentile of tech workers are also pretty awesome.</li>\n<li>It&#x2019;s not obvious that working more will help you get ahead at all in tech (although I think it&#x2019;s likely), and if so, what kind of work. &#xA0;Learning new technical skills, expanding your open source resume, working for high-prestige companies, expanding your network, and investing in leadership and interpersonal skills all seem plausible routes forward, and I think any of them could be the best, and any of them could have almost no effect.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Given this, my guess for the value of a marginal hour for a tech worker is something between a quarter and a half of their average salary. &#xA0;Again, this is enough of a difference that we could be significantly misled by valuing their time at their average hourly wage, as the examples above do.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Counterfactual spending</strong></p>\n<p>When I see these comparisons, they always compare the good done by volunteering to the amount of good that could be done with the full amount of money that the potential volunteer would earn. &#xA0;This comparison makes some sense in the abstract-- if I&#x2019;m willing to take a week off work to do good, I should be willing to work an additional week and donate the full amount, not just part of it. &#xA0;However, if I usually donate 10% of my earnings to charity, I will probably only donate 10% of my weeks earnings if I work that week.</p>\n<p>Note that this doesn&#x2019;t apply to everyone-- if you donate all of your earnings above an amount that you are certain to make, you can claim that every marginal dollar would be given to charity. &#xA0;However, if you don&#x2019;t use that system, and I believe most of us don&#x2019;t, you should either expect to donate your usual percentage to charity, or to do some complicated accounting.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Counterfactual Time Use</strong></p>\n<p>Another assumption these comparisons make is that time time spent on one of these activities comes only out of work time. &#xA0;I think this is often false, and we should generally guess that volunteer time comes partly out of work and partly out of recreation time.</p>\n<p>Since people usually make commitments at work to get particular things done, they pretty much have to work long enough to get those things done, so even if someone take Tuesday morning off to walk to the voting booth, they are increasing their probability of working late a future week.</p>\n<p>In addition, since many volunteer activities more closely resemble recreation than work, they may not only funge mostly against recreation time, but have the same positive effects as recreation. &#xA0;That is, if I take two weeks off of work to donate a kidney, I may return to work more rested and productive than if I had worked those two weeks.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Adding it Up</strong></p>\n<p>Say that I earn on average $100 per hour worked, and I&#x2019;m considering taking on some volunteer activity. &#xA0;If I assume that I can earn in a marginal hour half of what I do in an average hour, and if I work an extra hour that I&#x2019;ll donate half of the proceeds, and that the volunteer activity I&#x2019;m considering funges half against work and half against other non-work activities, then the amount I expect my donation to decrease by is not $100/hour, it&#x2019;s $12.50/hour. &#xA0;This order of magnitude difference could easily make the difference between &#x201C;worth it&#x201D; activities and &#x201C;not worth it&#x201D; ones.</p>\n<p>More importantly, though, how a particular time commitment affects your earnings depends a lot on the situation. &#xA0;Every time we make this type of comparison, we&#x2019;re making assumptions. &#xA0;Mine are more explicit, and I think they&#x2019;re more realistic, but even so they only apply to some situations. &#xA0;Someone with a flexible job taking on a small time commitment is likely to have their earnings change by essentially zero. &#xA0;Someone who is paid by the hour who has to trade their shift away to meet a new commitment probably loses essentially their full wages for that hour. &#xA0;No single number comparison will capture all or even most situations.</p>\n<p>All this somewhat begs the question, though-- how should we manage the trade-off between work and other potentially impactful activities? &#xA0;It seems like for most people, working and donating a portion of their salaries is the most impactful thing they can do, and it seems likely that working harder is a path to being able to donate more. &#xA0;It also seems likely that many of us are at risk of overcommitting to volunteer activities to the point where they do interfere substantially with our jobs. &#xA0;I think we can do better than naive hour-by-hour comparisons for understanding time tradeoffs.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Better Models for Time Tradeoffs</h2>\n<p>Instead of comparing the uses of every hour individually, people trying to maximize their earnings should have policies for how they<span> </span>spend their time. &#xA0;A simple and good example is a budget. &#xA0;I might commit to spending 50 hours/week on work (or on investing in work skills), 10 hours/week on other EA related activities, and use the rest of my time how I want. &#xA0;Using this system would allow me to still do activities that I want to do (voting, volunteering) in my free time, and feel confident that I&#x2019;m still doing a good job at work and investing in future earnings. &#xA0;If I overspend in one category, I can consider it a loan from the future, and pay it back later.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Understanding counterfactual use of time</strong></p>\n<p>I&#x2019;ve said that when deciding to spend time on something, it doesn&#x2019;t make sense to assume that in the counterfactual, that same time would be used for work. &#xA0;However, I don&apos;t have a high-certainty idea of what I would do in the counterfactual. &#xA0;Budgeting time gives us the opportunity to be able to answer that question better.</p>\n<p>When you&#x2019;re considering modifying a budget to add an ongoing time commitment, you can compare two plans directly, and be able to make claims with reasonable certainty about what you would do in the counterfactual if you don&#x2019;t take on a commitment.</p>\n<p>Jeff Kaufman wrote about <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/keeping-choices-donation-neutral\">keeping monetary choices donation neutral</a>&#xA0;(they also mention how they would approach some time tradeoffs).</p>\n<p>For many of us, donating money is going to be the most effective thing we do by a noticeable margin. &#xA0;If this is true of you, this probably means putting work in its own category, since regularly choosing to do something besides work with your work time is probably not donation neutral. &#xA0;If you don&apos;t think voting is an effective use of your time, but you still want to do it, go to the polls, but make sure you also meet your other time obligations for the week.</p>\n<p>This all leaves a question, though. &#xA0;My initial criticism was of a way we communicate about time tradeoffs (making naive one-off-comparisons). &#xA0;I&#x2019;ve talked about a better way for people to frame their decisions about how they spend their time, but I&#x2019;ve still deprived them of a catchy way to demonstrate the relative impact of different activities.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Better Ways to Talk about Time Use</strong></p>\n<p>Overall, I&#x2019;d rather see the impact of different activities compared to money than to time. &#xA0;While the good different people can do with an hour may vary from person to person, the good they can do with a dollar can&#x2019;t, so dollars makes a better currency for impact than time. &#xA0;I also think comparing the impact of an activity to the impact of a donation is similarly vivid--Scott Alexander uses in very well in <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2014/12/19/nobody-is-perfect-everything-is-commensurable/\">this recent post</a> to make the same point.</p>\n<p>I also think it&#x2019;s also reasonable to categorize an activity as &quot;not very effective.&quot; &#xA0;I think the examples of soup kitchen work and voting both count as good things that are far enough from being effective we should probably never call them EA activities. &#xA0;This doesn&#x2019;t mean you should never do them, only that you shouldn&#x2019;t put them in your &quot;altruism&quot;

I did it based on the calendar year because many of the expenses (medical visits, pre-birth purchases) started before the birth. This is all based on living in Boston, Massachusetts and trying to be fairly frugal but not painfully so.</span></p>\n<p><span>Childcare:&#xA0;We only used a couple of weeks of daycare at $350/week. We&#x2019;ve since switched to a system in which Jeff works full time and I work part time, and Lily is never in daycare. Our social life consists mostly of things we can bring her to, so we haven&#x2019;t really needed babysitters at night.</span></p>\n<p><span>Clothes: we get most clothes from thrift stores or the local children&#x2019;s resale shop, where they cost about $4/item. We did get hand-me-downs as well,&#xA0;so it would have been more without those.</span></p>\n<p><span>Gear: includes bottlefeeding stuff, cloth diapers, toys, a crib, a rug, and a series of glider chairs. In our area, it&apos;s easy to find many of these things used on Craigslist. Includes $100 for extra loads of laundry done. We got a carseat as a hand-me-down, but I added $100 to the tally in case you needed to get one. We spent $200 in airline fees to take Lily with us on vacation. Breast pumps are now&#xA0;<a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/coverage/breast-feeding-benefits/\">covered by insurance</a>&#xA0;in the US, but bottles and other parts are not.</span></p>\n<p><span>Medical/hygiene: copays and miscellaneous purchases at the drug store. We paid more for better medical insurance this year, plus more copays for more medical visits. Most of our insurance premiums are covered by Jeff&#x2019;s work, so if he worked for a less generous company we would have paid more.</span></p>\n<p><span>Lost wages: I got no paid maternity leave from my job, though I did save up about two weeks of vacation days.&#xA0;I quit my job for five months, then went back part-time. Jeff used 8 weeks of paid parental leave to care for Lily while I was working.&#xA0;My schedule currently dovetails with Jeff&#x2019;s: he works full-time starting at around 7 am, and I work evenings and Saturday mornings. If we had less flexible work schedules, or if he had not gotten the two months of paid leave, our costs would be higher.</span></p>\n<p><span>Housing is conspicuously absent on this chart. We did not change our housing this year, though we did start the process of buying a house. Lily slept in our bedroom. This got hairy at times, and we&#x2019;re looking forward to having a separate room for her. The delay in moving was more about looking for the right house than about trying to save money.</span></p>\n<p><span>Food: I ate an extra 500 calories daily while pregnant or breastfeeding. This cost about $500 extra in groceries. Lily&#x2019;s also eating some solids now, but she mostly eats yogurt and bits of what we&#x2019;re eating.</span></p>\n<p><span>We did not pay more for transportation because we did not buy a car. Living with family and being able to use their car sometimes was helpful.</span></p>\n<p><span>Not included: tax breaks. We expect around $350 in the child tax credit (maximum is $1000 if you earn less than we do). We also expect lower taxes in general because of having a dependent. We don&#x2019;t know how much this will end up saving us; I&#x2019;ll update after we do our taxes.</span></p>\n<p><span>Also not included: costs to our careers. Jeff taking the full paternity leave provided by his work probably hurt his job slightly, though not like it would in a more cut-throat business. Taking time off delayed me getting the hours of supervised work I need for the final step of social work licensure, which is essentially a ticket to better jobs.</span></p>\n<p><span>The federal government&#x2019;s &#x201C;cost to raise a child&#x201D;&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/calculatorintro.htm\">calculator</a>&#xA0;thinks we (as a two-parent high-income family in the Northeast) would spend about $30,000 during our child&#x2019;s first year, not including lost income, which I count as an expense. If we had been scrimping, we could have spent less, especially by using paid childcare for more of the time.</span></p>\n<p><span>Things that could make it more expensive for other families: moving to larger housing; buying a car or better car; formula-feeding (would cost around $1200/year);&#xA0;less flexible work schedules that would necessitate more child care from other people; less of health insurance covered by work;&#xA0;no paid paternity leave; higher initial earnings resulting in more earnings lost from unpaid leave; living in a more expensive area; using disposable diapers.</span></p>\n<p><span>Things that could make it less expensive for other families: more free care from relatives; receiving food assistance, daycare vouchers, or other benefits; lower income and thus more child tax credit; living in a cheaper area; using daycare more, allowing both parents to work full time; living in any of the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parental_leave#Benefits_in_a_selection_of_countries\">163 countries</a>&#xA0;that provide paid maternity leav</span><span>e.</span></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Julia_Wise"}}, {"_id": "6mmACsHiFB7Qajgnh", "title": "Why \"Changing the World\" is a Horrible Phrase", "postedAt": "2014-12-24T00:41:50.234Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><span>Steve Jobs famously convinced John Scully from Pepsi to join Apple Computer with the line, &#x201C;Do you want to sell sugared water for the rest of your life? Or do you want to come with me and change the world?&#x201D;.&#xA0; This sounds convincing until one thinks closely about it.</span></p>\n<p><span>Steve Jobs was a famous salesman. &#xA0; He was known for his selling ability, not his honesty.&#xA0; His terminology here was interesting.&#xA0; &#x2018;Change the world&#x2019; is a phrase that both sounds important and is difficult to argue with.&#xA0; Arguing if Apple was really &#x2018;changing the world&#x2019; would have been pointless, because the phrase was so ambiguous that there would be little to discuss.&#xA0; On paper, of course Apple is changing the world, but then of course any organization or any individual is also &#x2018;changing&#x2019; the world.&#xA0; A real discussion of if Apple &#x2018;changes the world&#x2019; would lead to a discussion of what &#x2018;changing the world&#x2019; actually means, which would lead to obscure philosophy, steering the conversation away from the actual point. &#xA0;</span></p>\n<p><span>&#x2018;Changing the world&#x2019; is an effective marketing tool that&#x2019;s useful for building the feeling of consensus. Steve Jobs used it heavily, as had endless numbers of businesses, conferences, nonprofits, and TV shows.&#xA0; It&#x2019;s used because it sounds good and is typically not questioned, so I&#x2019;m here to question it.&#xA0; I believe that the popularization of this phrase creates confused goals and perverse incentives from people who believe they are doing good things.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span><strong>Problem 1: &apos;Changing the World&apos; Leads to Television Value over Real Value</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>It leads nonprofit workers to passionately chase feeble things.&#xA0; I&#x2019;m amazed by the variety that I see in people who try to &#x2018;change the world&#x2019;. Some grow organic food, some research rocks, some play instruments. They do basically everything. &#xA0;</span></p>\n<p><span>Few people protest this variety.&#xA0; There are millions of voices giving the appeal to &#x2018;change the world&#x2019; in the way that would validate many radically diverse pursuits. &#xA0;</span></p>\n<p><span>TED, the modern symbol of the intellectual elite for many, is itself a grab bag of a ways to &#x2018;change the world&#x2019;, without any sense of scale between pursuits.&#xA0; People tell comedic stories, sing songs, discuss tales of personal adventures and so on.&#xA0; In TED Talks, all presentations are shown side-by-side with the same lighting and display.&#xA0; Yet in real life some projects produce orders of magnitude more output than others.</span></p>\n<p><span>At 80,000 Hours, I read many applications for career consulting. I got the sense that there are many people out there trying to live their lives in order to eventually produce a TED talk.&#xA0; To them, that is what &#x2018;changing the world&#x2019; means.&#xA0; These are often very smart and motivated people with very high opportunity costs. &#xA0;</span></p>\n<p>I would see an application that would express interest in either starting an orphanage in Uganda, creating a woman&apos;s movement in Ohio, or making a conservatory in Costa Rica.&#xA0; It was clear that they were trying to &#x2018;change the world&#x2019; in a very vague and TED-oriented way.</p>\n<p><span>I believe that &#x2018;Changing the World&#x2019; is promoted by TED, but internally acts mostly as a Schelling point.&#xA0; Agreeing on the importance of &#x2018;changing the world&#x2019; is a good way of coming to a consensus without having to decide on moral philosophy. &#x2018;Changing the world&#x2019; is simply the minimum common denominator for what that community can agree upon.&#xA0; This is a useful social tool, but an unfortunate side effect was that it inspired many others to follow this shelling point itself.&#xA0; Please don&#x2019;t make the purpose of your life the lowest common denominator of a specific group of existing intellectuals.&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p><span>It leads businesses to be gain employees and media attention without having to commit to anything.&#xA0; I&#x2019;m living in Silicon Valley, and &#x2018;Change the World&#x2019; is an incredibly common phrase for new and old startups. Silicon Valley (the TV show) made fun of it, as do much of the media.&#xA0; They should, but I think much of the time they miss the point; the problem here is not one where the companies are dishonest, but one where their honestly itself just doesn&#x2019;t mean much.&#xA0; Declaring that a company is &#x2018;changing the world&#x2019; isn&#x2019;t really declaring anything. &#xA0;</span></p>\n<p><span>Hiring conversations that begin and end with the motivation of &#x2018;changing the world&#x2019; are like hiring conversations that begin and end with making &#x2018;lots&#x2019; of money.&#xA0; If one couldn&#x2019;t compare salaries between different companies, they would likely select poorly for salary.&#xA0; In terms of social benefit, most companies don&#x2019;t attempt to quantify their costs and benefits on society except in very specific and positive ways for them.&#xA0; &#x201C;Google has enabled Haiti disaster recovery&#x201D; for social proof sounds to me like saying &#x201C;We paid this other person $12,000 in July 2010&#x201D; for salary proof. It sounds nice, but facts selected by a salesperson are simply not complete.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span><strong>Problem 2: &#x2018;Changing the World&#x2019; Creates Black and White Thinking</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>The idea that one wants to &#x2018;change the world&#x2019; implies that there is such a thing as &#x2018;changing the world&#x2019; and such a thing is &#x2018;not changing the world&#x2019;.&#xA0; It implies that there are &#x2018;world changers&#x2019; and people who are not &#x2018;world changers&#x2019;. It implies that there is one group of &#x2018;important people&#x2019; out there and then a lot of &#x2018;useless&#x2019; others.</span></p>\n<p><span>This directly supports the &#x2018;Great Man&#x2019; theory, a 19th century idea that history and future actions are led by a small number of &#x2018;great men&#x2019;.&#xA0; There&#x2019;s not a lot of academic research supporting this theory, but there&#x2019;s a lot of attention to it, and it&#x2019;s a lot of fun to pretend is true. &#xA0;</span></p>\n<p>But it&#x2019;s not.&#xA0; There is typically a lot of unglamorous work behind every successful project or organization. Behind every Steve Jobs are thousands of very intelligent and hard-working employees and millions of smart people who have created a larger ecosystem. If one only pays attention to Steve Jobs they will leave out most of the work. They will praise Steve Jobs far too highly and disregard the importance of unglamorous labor.</p>\n<p><span>Typically much of the best work is also the most unglamorous.&#xA0; Making WordPress websites, sorting facts into analysis, cold calling donors. Many the best ideas for organizations may be very simple and may have been done before. However, for someone looking to get to TED conferences or become superstars, it is very easy to look over other comparatively menial labor. This means that not only will it not get done, but those people who do it feel worse about themselves.</span></p>\n<p><span>So some people do important work and feel bad because it doesn&#x2019;t meet the TED standard of &#x2018;change the world&#x2019;.&#xA0; Others try ridiculously ambitious things outside their own capabilities, fail, and then give up.&#xA0; Others don&#x2019;t even try, because their perceived threshold is too high for them.&#xA0; The very idea of a threshold and a &#x2018;change or don&#x2019;t change the world&#x2019; approach is simply false, and believing something that&#x2019;s both false and fundamentally important is really bad.</span></p>\n<p><span>In all likelihood, you will not make the next billion-dollar nonprofit. You will not make the next billion-dollar business. You will not become the next congressperson in your district. This does not mean that you have not done a good job. It should not demoralize you in any way once you fail hardly to do these things.&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p>Finally, I would like to ponder on what happens once or if one does decide they have changed the world. What now? Should one change it again?</p>\n<p><span>It&#x2019;s not obvious.&#xA0; Many retire or settle down after feeling accomplished.&#xA0; However, this is exactly when trying is the most important.&#xA0; People with the best histories have the best potentials.&#xA0; No matter how much a U.S. President may achieve, they still can achieve significantly more after the end of their terms.&#xA0; There is no &#x2018;enough&#x2019; line for human accomplishment.</span></p>\n<p><span><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></p>\n<p><span>In summary the phrase change the world provides a lack of clear direction and encourages black-and-white thinking that distorts behaviors and motivation.&#xA0; However, I do believe that the phrase can act as a stepping stone towards a more concrete goal.&#xA0; &#x2018;Change the World&#x2019; can act as an idea that requires a philosophical continuation.&#xA0; It&#x2019;s a start for a goal, but it should be recognized that it&#x2019;s far from a good ending.</span></p>\n<p><span>Next time someone tells you about &#x2018;changing the world&#x2019;, ask them to follow through with telling you the specifics of what they mean.&#xA0; Make sure that they understand that they need to go further in order to mean anything. &#xA0;</span></p>\n<p>And more importantly, do this for yourself.&#xA0; Choose a specific axiomatic philosophy or set of philosophies and aim towards those.&#xA0; Your ultimate goal in life is too important to be based on an empty marketing term.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "oagr"}}, {"_id": "WgucsWuK4SunwNBvj", "title": "MIRI posts its technical research agenda [link]", "postedAt": "2014-12-24T00:27:30.639Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>Today, the Machine Intelligence Research Institute posted its <a href=\"http://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf\">technical research agenda</a>, written by Benja Fallenstein and Nate Soares.</p>\n<p>Here is the introduction. The paper is written predominantly for a technical audience, including AI scientists. But from an effective altruist point of view, section 5 may be worth a read.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>The characteristic that has enabled humanity to shape the world is not strength, not speed, but intelligence. Barring catastrophe, it seems clear that progress in AI will one day lead to the creation of agents meeting or exceeding human-level general intelligence, and this will likely lead to the eventual development of systems which are &quot;superintelligent&apos;&apos; in the sense of being &quot;smarter than the best human brains in practically every field&quot; (Bostrom 2014). A superintelligent system could have an enormous impact upon humanity: just as human intelligence has allowed the development of tools and strategies that let humans control the environment to an unprecedented degree, a superintelligent system would likely be capable of developing tools and strategies that give it extraordinary power (Muehlhauser and Salamon 2012). In light of this potential, it is essential to use caution when developing artificially intelligent systems capable of attaining or creating superintelligence.</span></p>\n<p>There is no reason to expect artificial agents to be driven by human motivations such as lust for power, but almost all goals can be better met with more resources (Omohundro 2008). This suggests that, by default, superintelligent agents would have incentives to acquire resources currently being used by humanity. (Can&apos;t we share? Likely not: there is no reason to expect artificial agents to be driven by human motivations such as fairness, compassion, or conservatism.) Thus, most goals would put the agent at odds with human interests, giving it incentives to deceive or manipulate its human operators and resist interventions designed to change or debug its behavior (Bostrom 2014, chap. 8).</p>\n<p>Care must be taken to avoid constructing systems that exhibit this default behavior. In order to ensure that the development of smarter-than-human intelligence has a positive impact on humanity, we must meet three formidable challenges: How can we create an agent that will reliably pursue the goals it is given? How can we formally specify beneficial goals? And how can we ensure that this agent will assist and cooperate with its programmers as they improve its design, given that mistakes in the initial version are inevitable?</p>\n<p>This agenda discusses technical research that is tractable today, which the authors think will make it easier to confront these three challenges in the future. Sections 2 through 4 motivate and discuss six research topics that we think are relevant to these challenges. Section 5 discusses our reasons for selecting these six areas in particular.</p>\n<p>We call a smarter-than-human system that reliably pursues beneficial goals &quot;aligned with human interests&quot; or simply &quot;aligned.&quot; To become confident that an agent is aligned in this way, a practical implementation that merely&#xA0;<em>seems</em>&#xA0;to meet the challenges outlined above will not suffice. It is also necessary to gain a solid theoretical understanding of why that confidence is justified. This technical agenda argues that there is foundational research approachable today that will make it easier to develop aligned systems in the future, and describes ongoing work on some of these problems.</p>\n<p>Of the three challenges, the one giving rise to the largest number of currently tractable research questions is the challenge of finding an agent architecture that will reliably pursue the goals it is given&#x2014;that is, an architecture which is alignable in the first place. This requires theoretical knowledge of how to design agents which reason well and behave as intended even in situations never envisioned by the programmers. The problem of highly reliable agent designs is discussed in Section 2.</p>\n<p>The challenge of developing agent designs which are tolerant of human error has also yielded a number of tractable problems. We argue that smarter-than-human systems would by default have incentives to manipulate and deceive the human operators. Therefore, special care must be taken to develop agent architectures which avert these incentives and are otherwise tolerant of programmer error. This problem and some related open questions are discussed in Section 3.</p>\n<p>Reliable, error-tolerant agent designs are only beneficial if they are aligned with human interests. The difficulty of concretely specifying what is meant by &quot;beneficial behavior&quot; implies a need for some way to construct agents that reliably<em>learn</em>&#xA0;what to value (Bostrom 2014, chap. 12). A solution to this &quot;value learning&apos;&apos; problem is vital; attempts to start making progress are reviewed in Section 4.</p>\n<p>Why these problems? Why now? Section 5 answers these questions and others. In short, the authors believe that there is theoretical research which can be done today that will make it easier to design aligned smarter-than-human systems in the future.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Further discussion on <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/lfc/miris_technical_research_agenda/\">LessWrong</a></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "RyanCarey"}}, {"_id": "59KBJXSeZvTt6fB6u", "title": "How I Raised $5010.32 for AMF and How You Can Too!", "postedAt": "2014-12-23T15:29:43.162Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><span>This essay is my entry into the December edition of </span><a href=\"http://www.effective-altruism.com/ea/bp/figuring_good_out_launch_thread/\"><span>Figuring Good Out</span></a><span>, the effective altruism blogging carnival.

fundraising experiments to see what works in fundraising and spreading effective altruism to the laypublic.</span></p>\n<p><span>I was excited when one of the things Joey Savoie and Xio Kikauka, the co-founders of Charity Science, did to fundraise was just try to directly fundraise from their friends, no frills involved. &#xA0;They launched simple fundraisers on the YouCaring platform, asking for donations on their birthdays rather than for money, raising </span><a

unexpected came about -- Theron Pummer, a philosophy post-doc associated with </span><a href=\"http://www.populationethics.org/\"><span>FHI&#x2019;s Population Ethics Project</span></a><span>, raised $8036 from </span><a href=\"http://www.youcaring.com/other/i-m-donating-my-birthday-/227539\"><span>his birthday fundraiser</span></a><span> (~$2K USD / $2.3K CAD from his page and the rest from a

came around, I was eager to try to run a fundraiser myself. &#xA0;I was curious how much I would raise. &#xA0;I was pretty sure that Theron was just a wizard, and that I would aim for a more modest goal of $500, which would become $1K with the matching that Charity Science would provide. &#xA0;So I </span><a href=\"http://birthday.causevox.com/peter-hurford\"><span>set up my fundraiser</span></a><span> using the flashy CauseVox platform that Charity Science had just set up, and started raising money.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>...It turned out that Theron wasn&apos;t a wizard.</span></p>\n<p><span>Two days into my fundraiser I already exceeded my $1K goal (with matching), and doubled my fundraiser to $2K. &#xA0;Four days after that, I crossed $2K and re-aimed for $3K. &#xA0;That same day, $3K was met and I set my sights on $4K. &#xA0;$4K remained elusive until the very last day of the fundraiser, when I crossed $4K and sailed all the way onto and past $5K that very day.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>I consider myself pretty ordinary with regard to my interpersonal skills, maybe even a bit below average. &#xA0;I&apos;m certainly not a professional fundraiser by any means. &#xA0;I raised this $5K using 15 simple tips that I&apos;m confident any EA could replicate, as long as they&apos;re willing to put in the hard work.</span></p>\n<p><span><img

alt=\"\"></span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>TIP #1: There is no substitute for hours behind the wheel</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>When I was learning how to drive, my Dad told me that there is no substitute for hours behind the wheel. &#xA0;I could try to optimize my lesson plan, but ultimately there was nothing I could do but put in the many hours it takes to learn how to drive a car safely. &#xA0;Everything else in my life has been the same. &#xA0;Including fundraising.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>There certainly are ways to work smarter not harder here, and I&apos;ll share those tips. &#xA0;But even with those optimizations, I still spent 17 hours directly on running my fundraiser. &#xA0;Yes, I got bored and demotivated at times, but then I reminded myself that all of those hours would be me earning an effective wage of ~$295 per hour.</span></p>\n<p><span>If you&apos;re already earning more than $295 an hour, you get a free pass on running a fundraiser. &#xA0;But for the rest of us, very few things we do earn us $295 per hour of effort. &#xA0;Do you like the idea of earning $295 per hour? &#xA0;If so, run a fundraiser, and spend a lot of time on it.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>-</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>TIP #2: Contact A LOT of people, 1-on-1, in a personal and genuine manner</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Want to raise a lot of money for charity? &#xA0;Clear your calendar for a weekend, sit down, and start reconnecting with your friends.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Err on the side of contacting more people rather than less. &#xA0;The people who give might surprise you, and while I far-and-above raised more money from people I knew more recently and had kept in touch with (e.g., talked to them this year), I raised a decent amount of money based on pretty flimsy connections (e.g., people I barely talked to in college or people I hadn&apos;t talked to in 4+ years).</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>My rule of thumb was (1) &quot;would I genuinely be interested in hearing about what this person is up to?&quot; and (2) &quot;do I expect this person to care about a life update from me?&quot;. &#xA0;If the answer to both these questions was yes, I contacted them -- no exceptions.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>I booted Facebook, and looked through my friends list, and made a note of everyone who met my dual criteria. &#xA0;I then made a list of all the contexts in which I knew friends -- from work, from college, from high school, and from family -- and tried to fill in people who may have fallen through the FB cracks. &#xA0;(There were a few -- notably, I don&apos;t have anyone from my work on Facebook.) </span></p>\n<p><span>That resulted in 152 names. &#xA0;I then sent a personalized message to 149 of them (for three people, I couldn&apos;t get up-to-date contact information).</span></p>\n<p><span>That message looked something like this:</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span><span>Hey Samantha,</span></span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span><span>It was great to see you and Kyle at the Event Workshop in June. &#xA0;Thank you for driving me to the bus station on time; I was worried that I wouldn&apos;t be able to get a ride! &#xA0;I did manage to get home safe and sound. &#xA0;How have things gone since then for you? &#xA0;How are things with Jim?</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span> </span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>I&apos;ve personally been having a good time living in Chicago. &#xA0;I work as a data scientist in a start-up here, doing analytics work. &#xA0;While not doing that, I&apos;ve been helping out two of my friends, who have started a non-profit. &#xA0;They work to end malaria in Africa. &#xA0;Since my birthday is coming up on December 11, I&apos;ve decided to donate my birthday to them and run a birthday fundraiser to help raise money to fight malaria.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><br></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>For just $10, you can buy three bed nets -- these are nets that a family sleeps under that prevents mosquitoes from getting to them, stopping them from getting malaria (since malaria-carrying mosquitoes only strike at night). &#xA0;This is an amazing buy in healthcare, and has been backed as one of the best &quot;bangs for your buck&quot; in charity by the United Nations. &#xA0;Also, it gets better -- thanks to an anonymous benefactor, every dollar you give will be doubled!</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><br></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>My birthday fundraising campaign is here if you want to donate: http://birthday.causevox.com/peter-hurford</span></span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span><span>But if you don&apos;t want to donate or don&apos;t have anything to chip in, that&apos;s totally ok. &#xA0;I&apos;m still happy for your support and would love to know how things are doing.</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span><br></span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Best,</span></span></p>\n<p><span><span>Peter</span></span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>(Of course, don&#x2019;t just copy this message and tweak it, because it has to sound like it actually came from you, or it&#x2019;s not genuine.)</span></p>\n<p><span>...In some cases I had to improvise on the fly. &#xA0;Some people already knew about my job in Chicago, so it would be silly to tell them again. &#xA0;For some, I squeaked by with a &quot;I probably already told you this, but just in case you forgot...&quot; but for others I had to re-write that section completely, usually just mentioning the non-profit part (which I really haven&apos;t told many people about).</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Note that it&apos;s the personal intro in the beginning that makes all the difference, and separates your genuine message from spam. &#xA0;I tried hard to spend about 1-2 minutes personalizing this for each person. &#xA0;Of course, some people I knew less well and didn&apos;t have a hook, so I had to ask more general questions, like about their Thanksgiving. &#xA0;Notably, the people I knew less well responded much less. &#xA0;(Though, if you&#x2019;re short on time, it does appear that less personalized emails have worked well for other people, like Theron.)</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Doing this, I got 71 responses (response rate 47.6%!) and at least 33 of the people I contacted did donate (possibly more because of anonymous donations).</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>TIP #3: Remember, people will be grateful for the chance to help you</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>I originally felt bad about messaging people about this -- I was taking time out of their day for what could be construed as a spammy message. &#xA0;While I can&apos;t say what the people who didn&apos;t respond thought, the people who did respond were really grateful to help out. &#xA0;Some choice quotes...</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>&quot;I have always been impressed by your dedication to put time and money where your mouth is on ethics, so I&apos;d be glad to help out there.&quot;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>&quot;super cool that your friends started a non-profit working with the Against Malaria Foundation plus that you are giving up your birthday for an amazing cause&quot;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>&quot;I will be happy to make a donation and thank you for asking. I am glad to hear you are still involved with community service. I think it is so important to volunteer time and passion towards something you believe in.&quot;</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>...and there were </span><span>many</span><span> other responses along those lines.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>TIP #4: Use psychology in your messaging</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>I&apos;ve been studying psychology, persuasion, and fundraising, and I was curious to try out some of the influence tricks I had learned. &#xA0;I was very intentional with how I crafted my message. &#xA0;Of course, I can&apos;t say if any of these tricks worked (for all I know they may have even backfired!), but it seemed like my best bet.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><span>Starting the message personal made the message genuine and not spammy. &#xA0;I genuinely want to re-connect.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span>I asked questions such as &quot;How are things going with you?&quot; rather than statements like &quot;I hope things are going well&quot;. &#xA0;This leads people to be more likely to respond, to answer those questions.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span>I&apos;m fundraising for myself and a friend, not the detached Against Malaria Foundation or GiveWell. &#xA0;People want to help me, because I&apos;m nice and it&apos;s my birthday. &#xA0;They care less about the actual organization we&apos;re supporting. If you&apos;re not friends with Joey and Xio, this tactic might be less genuine, but you could become their friends!</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span>I&apos;m donating my birthday. &#xA0;This is a special occasion, and not a random solicitation.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span>I indirectly suggest a donation of $10 even though this doesn&apos;t make a lot of sense in context. &#xA0;From my reading of the Obama campaign, $10 is a good suggestion for millennials. &#xA0;Probably not by coincidence, lots of people gave me precisely $10. &#xA0;Note that I didn&apos;t directly suggest $10, which I think would have come across as rude.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span>I give credibility to the intervention by associating it with the United Nations. &#xA0;(Yes, this is </span><a href=\"http://www.unfoundation.org/what-we-do/issues/global-health/preventing-malaria-deaths.html\"><span>an actual thing</span></a><span>.) &#xA0;Many more people recognize the United Nations than GiveWell and see the UN as a genuine authority, even though GiveWell is important. &#xA0;Note that I don&apos;t mention GiveWell (or &quot;effective altruism&quot;), so as to not confuse the message.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span>I mention donation matching. &#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://www.nber.org/papers/w12338\"><span>People love their donation getting matched</span></a><span>. &#xA0;(I didn&#x2019;t try out the </span><a href=\"http://www.vox.com/2014/10/30/7131345/overhead-free-donations-charity-fundraising-seed-matching-gneezy\"><span>no overhead trick</span></a><span> because I was wary of spreading the anti-overhead myth and I didn&#x2019;t want the message to be too long.)</span></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><span>I reaffirm that people don&apos;t have to donate if they don&apos;t want to or can&apos;t. &#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://www.spring.org.uk/2013/02/the-one-really-easy-persuasion-technique-everyone-should-know.php\"><span>People love having their freedom of choice affirmed</span></a><span>.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><br></div>\n<p><span>TIP #5: Follow up with people</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>When people respond to your message, you should obviously follow up in a timely manner. &#xA0;That&apos;s just being polite. &#xA0;But what about the people who don&apos;t respond?</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Ideally you should wait a few days and then follow-up. &#xA0;Many people want to donate, but are too busy, or get side-tracked. &#xA0;Several of the people I reminded expressed appreciation for the reminder, and no one seemed put off by it. &#xA0;Non-profits with actual fundraising campaigns do follow-ups all the time.</span></p>\n<p><span>I didn&apos;t follow up with everyone. &#xA0;I actually only followed up with people who replied to me, mentioned something about promising to donate (e.g., &quot;I&apos;d love to help out!&quot;), but didn&apos;t actually donate. &#xA0;Following up got a good amount of donations that probably would have fallen on the wayside otherwise, and I probably ought to have followed up more than I actually did.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Here&#x2019;s the follow-up I sent:</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>Hey Emily,</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>I hope finals are wrapping up well.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>If you&apos;re still interested in supporting my fundraiser, just wanted to let you know that the deadline for donations is the end of the day tomorrow. &#xA0;We&apos;ve already raised over $3500, and all donations are still being matched dollar-for-dollar!</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Here&apos;s the fundraising page: http://birthday.causevox.com/peter-hurford</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Also, do remember to personally thank your donors (at least the ones that don&apos;t donate anonymously)!</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>TIP #6: Make it into a sales funnel</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>I love the idea of making things into sales funnels whenever appropriate, which is more times than you might think. &#xA0;You don&apos;t contact 149 people without having some good way of tracking what&apos;s going on.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/H5HRSvP6d6R-Y3q1oRDWvip2UCZ0y2aDzhYkIb99CLhWb8biztXrElHNZ85TZF6pTCk10a7htRGYP-I277tp6botdTiaHtuwnRHZdZgZnnT5RvkMd1rMlAXsAzIFsDMq5A\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2014-12-20 at 5.52.36 PM.png\"></span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Here, I made sure that each person got contacted at least once (&quot;green&quot; first box) and then followed up where appropriate.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>I marked the &quot;Sold?&quot; column in grey if they had not yet responded to my message, orange if they responded and I needed to reply back, blue if we were in a conversation (they had responded and I had replied back), black if they told me explicitly they weren&apos;t going to donate (only happened twice), and green if they did end up making a donation.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>I used the notes column to keep track of how they responded, and whether they had promised to donate or not.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>This might be a bit too freaky organized, but it really helped.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>TIP #7: Don&apos;t neglect publishing on social media too</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>While the 1-on-1 contacts are the biggest drivers of donations, posting about the campaign on Facebook ended up being more important than I had realized, since it (a) drove donations from a few people I didn&apos;t think to ask 1-on-1, and (b) acted as a reminder. &#xA0;In particular, the message I posted about it being the last day to donate really drove people to give.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>At the start of my campaign --</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>Want to know what you can get me for my birthday or Christmas? A malaria-free world!</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>http://birthday.causevox.com/peter-hurford</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>I thought about what I wanted for my birthday, and I realized it was stupid just how much I&apos;ve already gotten everything I&apos;ve wanted out of life. There&apos;s not anything I could want that I couldn&apos;t just buy myself in a moment&apos;s notice. But there are children who are sick from malaria and can&apos;t afford the treatment needed to become healthy. Besides being a health issue, malaria is the single greatest drag on Africa&#x2019;s economy. The solution is surprisingly easy: a simple net will do the trick.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>For just $10, you can buy 3 nets that protect two people for ten years each. This is an amazing buy in healthcare, and has been backed as one of the best &quot;bangs for your buck&quot; in charity by independent charity evaluators such as GiveWell and the United Nations.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>And it gets better -- thanks to an anonymous benefactor, every dollar you give will be doubled! Take your chance to double your impact!</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>This is an issue I care passionately about, and I thank you for your support! The families will thank you too.</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Six days before the end of the campaign, on my birthday --</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>I&apos;ve been really delighted to use my birthday to protect people in the developing world from malaria. I&apos;ve been overwhelmed by the support so far, raising over $3000 (!!!) for a good cause.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>$10 is all it takes to buy three bed nets -- nets that a family sleeps under to prevents mosquitoes from getting to them, stopping them from getting malaria (since malaria-carrying mosquitoes only strike at night).</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Not only is it an amazing cause -- backed as one of the best &quot;bangs for your buck&quot; in charity by the United Nations -- but every donation made so far is being *doubled* by an anonymous supporter.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>I can&apos;t keep the fundraiser open forever -- eventually we&apos;ll need to use the funds. But I am keeping it open until 17 December. If you want to donate, you can find my fundraiser here: http://birthday.causevox.com/peter-hurford</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Together, we can help end malaria!</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Right before the end of the campaign --</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>My birthday fundraiser just finally reached it&apos;s 4000th dollar in donations. Wow! I&apos;m really excited for all the support you guys have pitched in. Dozens of individual donations!</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Of course, $4000 still doesn&apos;t mean malaria control is fully funded. The cause is still as important as ever. My fundraiser is still open for ten more hours, so if you wanted to contribute, and get your donation matched dollar-for-dollar, now&apos;s your final chance!</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Remember $10 is all it takes to buy three bed nets -- nets that a family sleeps under to prevents mosquitoes from getting to them, stopping them from getting malaria. One of the most cost-effective interventions you can fund.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>If you want to donate, you can find my fundraiser here: http://birthday.causevox.com/peter-hurford. </span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Ten hours remain!</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>The day after the campaign --</span></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><span>Thanks everyone who was involved with my birthday for charity fundraiser! Together we raised precisely $5000 Canadian dollars ($4309 in freedom dollars) -- a nice round number, and enough to fund over 1500 bed nets to protect people from malaria.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Woohoo!</span></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Note many of the techniques mentioned earlier, plus (I) mentioning the donation totals so as to invoke [social proof] and (J) adding in urgency.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>(Also, thanks to Jess Whittlestone for </span><a href=\"http://www.cafe.com/charity/today-is-giving-tuesday-so-where-should-you-give?u=d98f7e49-856f-4d64-8d9d-ef53727c1d5a\"><span>unwittingly giving me the language</span></a><span> to use in my first FB post appeal and on my actual campaign page.)</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>TIP #8: Give your fundraiser some time, but not too much time</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>I think it would have been smart to do the week before my birthday and the week after. &#xA0;I think I started a bit too early. &#xA0;People need some time to donate and you need some time to get all the messages out, so make sure there&apos;s time for both. &#xA0;But people respond well to the urgency of the campaign ending.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>TIP #9: Don&#x2019;t worry too much about your fundraising target, but have a strategy.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>What should you set your fundraising goal to be? &#xA0;The simple question is to think about how much you can raise, and set it to that. &#xA0;(Well, with donation matching, multiply it by two.)</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>People like goals that are high, but within reach. &#xA0;I personally thought that raising $500 was well within my reach (as several others had done it), so I made my initial goal $1K.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>One thing I was worried about was that I knew of a few people I thought had a chance of donating several hundred dollars, and I didn&#x2019;t want them to see a goal with only $50 to go and then donate only $50 as they think I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to accept more money than that. &#xA0;So I tried to keep my goal about $500 above my total raised at all times, until the very last day.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>TIP #10: Think about who else might share your fundraiser</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>To be honest, I didn&apos;t really think this tip through as much as I should have. &#xA0;Toward the end of my campaign, my girlfriend shared it on her FB wall, which led to some additional donations. &#xA0;This could have potentially been a lot bigger had I got her involved earlier. &#xA0;It also may have been good to consider who else would agree to spread my campaign but would be unwilling to do a campaign of their own.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>TIP #11: You will mess up. &#xA0;And that&apos;s ok.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>There were times when I sent out typos, flubbed the personal introduction, and even flubbed the byline (saying &quot;Hey Patrick&quot; to Sally). &#xA0;Needless to say, this is very embarrassing!</span></p>\n<p><span>This usually happened when I tried to get a bit too wild with copy/paste and Facebook&apos;s &quot;hit enter to send&quot; feature. &#xA0;You can mitigate it by being more careful, but I&apos;m pretty sure you can&apos;t eliminate it. &#xA0;You&apos;ll just have to accept it. &#xA0;The people I blundered on were pretty understanding when I immediately apologized and explained. &#xA0;I don&apos;t think any of them ended up donating, but I don&apos;t think I harmed any friendships.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>TIP #12: Keep in contact with people in the off-season</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>Again, the point of this is to make genuine connections and re-connections, not just to use your friends as a means to an end of fundraising. &#xA0;It&apos;s important to keep in contact with your friends even when not fundraising. &#xA0;I&apos;m excited to use my fundraiser as a launching point to rekindle some old relationships, and I enjoyed having a few phone calls with old pals.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>TIP #13: Yes, there is an 80-20 to fundraising, but it&apos;s not everything.</span></p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><span>I raised $2505 prior to the matching funds. &#xA0;$1000 of this (40%) came from two different people. &#xA0;So, instead of spending 17 hours talking to everyone, why not spend 30 minutes talking to those two people and call it a day with a $2K after-match fundraiser?</span></p>\n<p><span>There certainly is a power law to fundraisers. &#xA0;However, I don&apos;t think the big donors you know would act nearly as much if there aren&apos;t smaller donors as well.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Moreover, even if your FB friends aren&apos;t big donors, it&apos;s still worth contacting them. &#xA0;When I take out these two outliers, each FB contact was still worth about $2 in expectation.</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>If you&#x2019;re short on time, definitely do something rather than do everything.

"2014-12-23T12:12:08.789Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><em><strong>Summary</strong>: We can split the cost-effectiveness of an intervention into how good the cause is, and how good the intervention is relative to the cause. This perspective could help our efforts in prioritisation by letting us bring appropriate tools to bear on the different parts.</em></p>\n<h2>Cost-effectiveness comparisons</h2>\n<p>When we choose between giving time or money to different interventions, we&#x2019;re making a comparison. It&#x2019;s nice to know what these comparisons come down to. There are a lot of sources of evidence, and different ones will be more appropriate in different contexts.</p>\n<p>Say we are comparing between intervention <em>x</em> in cause area X, and intervention <em>y</em> in cause area Y. How they compare depends on things like how well thought-out <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> are, how competent the people and organisations implementing them are, as well as how valuable X is as a whole compared to Y.</p>\n<p>These are all important factors in telling us how <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> ultimately compare, but they&#x2019;re quite different from one another. So it shouldn&#x2019;t be a surprise if it&#x2019;s best to use different methods to compare the different factors. I think this is the case.</p>\n<p>Consider the equation:</p>\n<h6><strong>Cost-effectiveness of intervention = (cost-effectiveness of area) * (leverage ratio of intervention)</strong></h6>\n<p><strong></strong> The left-hand side of this equation expresses how much good is achieved per unit of resources invested in the intervention. For the intervention <em>x</em> we&#x2019;ll denote this G(<em>x</em>). The right-hand side breaks this up as C(X), how much good is achieved per unit of resources invested in X as a whole, and a &#x2018;leverage ratio&#x2019; L(<em>x</em>) which expresses the ratio of how effective <em>x</em> is compared to X as a whole [1].</p>\n<p>Now to compare between <em>x</em> and <em>y</em> we&#x2019;re interested in the ratio G(<em>x</em>)/G(<em>y</em>). We can use the above equation to expand this:</p>\n<p>G(<em>x</em>)/G(<em>y</em>) = (C(X)L(<em>x</em>))/(C(Y)L(<em>y</em>)).</p>\n<p>This rearranges to:</p>\n<p>G(<em>x</em>)/G(<em>y</em>) = C(X)/C(Y) * L(<em>x</em>)/L(<em>y</em>).</p>\n<p>Here we&#x2019;ve split the comparison into two parts, each of which is comparing like with like. This is a good general strategy: making comparisons between dissimilar things is hard, and our intuitions are sometimes terrible at it, so it&#x2019;s helpful to break it into more comparable chunks [2].</p>\n<h2>Comparing cause effectiveness</h2>\n<p>Comparing the cost-effectiveness of different cause areas is quite far removed from everyday experience, and it doesn&#x2019;t have a good feedback mechanism as it can be hard to tell how much something helped the world even after the fact. Moreover it&#x2019;s just the right setting for <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_neglect\">scope insensitivity</a>&#xA0;to cause problems for intuitive judgements. This means that relative to most areas of experience, we should be particularly cautious about putting too much weight on intuitive judgements. This in turn means that it&#x2019;s an area where explicit models are particularly valuable.</p>\n<p>That doesn&#x2019;t mean that explicit models always trump intuitive judgements in this domain; in particular, simple models often omit important factors that are incorporated into our intuitions. <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2014/06/10/sequence-thinking-vs-cluster-thinking/\">Nor does it mean that we should put all our trust into a single model</a>.&#xA0;But it does mean that it&#x2019;s particularly valuable to build, critique, and refine models for the cost-effectiveness of different causes. It also means we should put <a href=\"http://meteuphoric.wordpress.com/2010/12/20/estimation-is-the-best-we-have/\">more weight on the outputs of such models</a>&#xA0;than we do in most domains -- not because the models are more trustworthy, but because the alternatives are worse than usual. This is why I think developing such models is a high value activity, and why I&#x2019;ve been <a href=\"/ea/c3/estimating_the_costeffectiveness_of_research/\">spending time on it</a>.</p>\n<h2>Comparing leverage ratios</h2>\n<p>The leverage ratios are determined largely by things like: whether the intervention is a sensible way of progressing on the cause; the quality of the team involved; how functional the implementing organisation is. In contrast to the overall effectiveness of a cause, these are the much closer to regular experience, so we should be less keen to use explicit models. On the other hand, methods and experience from valuing shares of companies (which have good feedback mechanisms) should be relevant in this context.</p>\n<p>There are several reasons why leverage ratios may vary within a cause area. Many of these will be common across cause areas. Because of this, we might expect similar distributions of leverage ratios in different cause areas (but probably some areas have more variance than others, <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2012/09/how-good-are-the-best/\">just as some jobs have more variance in the productivity of employees than others</a>). It could be valuable to have an idea of how much leverage ratios do vary in practice. This is an empirical question we might be able to get data for.</p>\n<h2>Implications for prioritisation work</h2>\n<p>To choose between interventions, we need to compare cost-effectiveness. I&#x2019;ve claimed that this is best done by comparing the cost-effectiveness of cause areas, and comparing the leverage ratios of the interventions. If this is right, what&#x2019;s more valuable to work on evaluating?</p>\n<p>Of course they are complementary to each other. The better we are able to identify the best cause areas, the more valuable it is to have good estimates for the leverage ratios of interventions in those areas. And the better we are able to identify interventions with very high leverage ratios, the more valuable it is to be able to say which of those are in the most effective causes. So the answer depends in part on how much work each is already receiving.</p>\n<p>It also depends on your beliefs about which component has more variance. If you think that most of the variation in intervention effectiveness comes from leverage ratios, while cost-effectiveness of causes doesn&#x2019;t vary that much, then it&#x2019;s more important to evaluate the leverage ratios of interventions. If on the other hand you think more variation comes between causes, then it&#x2019;s more important to evaluate cause effectiveness. I currently think there is likely to be more variation in cause effectiveness even after you filter to the ones which could plausibly be high value; however I am quite uncertain about this.</p>\n<p>There is also an asymmetry which pushes us towards doing more cause assessment first: it&#x2019;s much easier to cut down the work of evaluating leverage ratios by restricting to a few causes than it is to cut down the work of evaluating cause effectiveness by first identifying opportunities with high leverage ratios. Similarly, if we identify a cause area which is valuable but see no good interventions available to fund, <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2014/05/14/the-importance-of-committing-to-causes/\">we can advertise this and hopefully create good interventions in the area</a>.</p>\n<p>Of course to support giving decisions today we need to compare leverage ratios as well as cause effectiveness. And in some cases studying the interventions may help us to evaluate the cause effectiveness. But I think it will usually be right to investigate leverage ratios only within cause areas that we think have, or might have, high effectiveness, and only after we&#x2019;ve made an effort to assess that.</p>\n<p><small><em>Acknowledgements</em>: thanks to Toby Ord and Nick Beckstead for helpful conversations.</small></p>\n<p><small>Crossposted from the <a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/factoring-cost-effectiveness/\">Global Priorities Project</a>.</small></p>\n<p><small> </small></p>\n<p><small>[1] The leverage ratio is really a function of <em>x</em> together with X. <a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/Default.aspx\">AMF</a> may have one leverage ratio with respect to the area of global health, and another with respect to malaria treatment.</small></p>\n<p><small>[2] An extra advantage of breaking the comparisons into like-with-like is that it&#x2019;s easier to track uncertainty so that it doesn&#x2019;t blow up unnecessarily. I might be very uncertain about how good X is, so I think C(X) lies somewhere in (1, 100). I might also be very uncertain about how good Y is, so that I think C(Y) lies in (1, 100). But it doesn&#x2019;t follow that C(X)/C(Y) could lie anywhere in (1/100, 100). If my uncertainty about X is related to my uncertainty about Y (say X is reducing carbon emissions and Y is helping communities adapt to climate change), then I might have a better idea of the ratio C(X)/C(Y) than I do about either individually. Of course this just means that my estimates for C(X) and C(Y) are strongly correlated. But I think it&#x2019;s helpful to have an idea of practical ways to break up the calculation which help to keep the uncertainty under control.

The same person can be provided with a guide dog for $50,000. There are charities doing each. Both charities are definitely helping people and doing good. But one is helping a lot more people with the same resources. There&#x2019;s something awkward here. It feels nicer to give a bit to all the good charities. But in a world with scarce resources, that&#x2019;s a very costly attitude to have.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Tip 3: Take a big step back</strong></p>\n<p>We all support causes close to our heart. Yet the causes close to our heart are the ones most visible to us and theses may not be the best places to give. What would happen if instead of saying: &#x201C;my mother died of cancer, so I will support cancer charities&#x201D; people said: &#x201C;my mother died of cancer, so I will support the charities that save the lives of as many mothers as possible&#x201D;?</p>\n<p>Take some time to work out what you really want.

&#xA0;Is the book actionable? &#xA0;I personally aim to read books that come to me in reviews, that from a skim of their table of contents look like they&apos;ll provide real value to me.</p>\n<p><strong>I think about what else I could be doing instead of reading.</strong> &#xA0;Reading is great, but in many cases experience can be a better teacher. &#xA0;Moreover, picking up some experience can help me understand and apply the lessons in books better. &#xA0;I try to adopt a &quot;doing-reading&quot; loop, where I read something, act upon it, then read another something, etc., continuing to iteratively improve in whatever skill I&apos;m after. &#xA0;This also helps validate the advice of books.</p>\n<p><strong>I&apos;m not afraid to ditch an&#xA0;underperforming&#xA0;book. &#xA0;</strong>If I don&apos;t like it, it&apos;s wasting my time, and it&apos;s time to move on.</p>\n<p><strong>I consider sources other than books.</strong> Books are often the best source of information on any topic, and are often higher quality because they&apos;re intensely reviewed. &#xA0;But many blog posts and online resources can be great too. &#xA0;I Ignore them at my own peril.</p>\n<p><strong>I read a summary, read the book, then re-read the summary.</strong>&#xA0; My favorite loop for retaining the main ideas of the book I read is to first find a high quality summary of the book and familiarize myself with the basic points. &#xA0;Then I read the actual book. &#xA0;Then, when I&apos;m finished, I look back on the summary and remind myself of the key points and think of the examples that came up in the book. &#xA0;Note that I can&apos;t just read the summary because summaries often only work to remind myself of the book and not to replace the book&apos;s content. &#xA0;(Also note that this summary-read-summary loop might not work well with some books, like textbooks.)</p>\n<p><strong>I skim and read actively.</strong> If I&apos;m hunting for information, there&apos;s no need to read every word on every page. &#xA0;I feel free to skip through parts I already know, or when the author is belaboring the point too much. &#xA0;Conversely, I re-read important sections.</p>\n<p><strong>I use Audible, Pocket, and Kindle.</strong>&#xA0; Even with the best of intentions, I never actually make the time to read. &#xA0;Instead, I&apos;ve found much more success with fitting reading into the gaps of my day. &#xA0;I use <a href=\"http://www.audible.com\">Audible</a>&#xA0;to listen to audiobooks when I&apos;m exercising, cleaning, or commuting. &#xA0;I use <a href=\"http://www.getpocket.com\">Pocket</a> on my phone to read blog posts when I&apos;m standing in line or in the bathroom. &#xA0;I use <a href=\"https://kindle.amazon.com/\">Kindle</a>&#xA0;on my computer when I&apos;m between tasks, or waiting for a program to run. &#xA0;Substitute other apps as you see fit, but fill your time.</p>\n<p><strong>I take notes during, or at least after.</strong>&#xA0;Ideally, I should be taking notes on what I read as I read them. &#xA0;But this usually doesn&apos;t end up happening. &#xA0;Either way, I aim to take some time after reading the book to summarize the book and internalize my lessons learned and figure out what it is about my life (and/or my research program) will be different after reading the book. &#xA0;If I can&apos;t come up with an answer, I probably wasted my time reading the book.</p>\n<p><strong>I slow down to digest the books.</strong> &#xA0;Many good books teach a lot at once, and I need to slow down to reflect upon each piece. &#xA0;Many times, this means I have to take some time away from the book to reflect.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Peter_Hurford"}}, {"_id": "yGZWnxLqJoGW3vRfA", "title": "Two examples of EAs raising thousands from their friends", "postedAt": "2014-12-19T23:40:03.676Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><img src=\"https://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mak6ktGGkA1ru90dzo1_250.gif\" alt=\"\"><span>Two recent Charity Science birthday fundraisers have raised thousands of dollars each.

They simply emailed a particularly large cross-section of their personal networks - Peter, for instance, emailed 145 people. Naturally, the majority of these people weren&#x2019;t in the habit of giving them birthday presents, but this didn&#x2019;t matter in the way it would have had Theron and Peter been asking for accessories for their private yachts (which I gather are already well furnished). We&#x2019;ve consistently found that friends and family react very positively when asked if they want to contribute to fundraisers. Many of Theron&#x2019;s donations came from philosophers who he only knew passingly from conferences and the like, and hadn&#x2019;t spoken to in a long time.</p>\n<p>One useful lesson from this is that many people don&#x2019;t need much prompting to give to effective charities. Plausibly they were ready to give to charity anyway, and a friend (even a loose one) making an ask prompted them to do so and determined their charity choice. It&#x2019;s worth noting that Theron and Peter judged that the vast majority of their donations wouldn&#x2019;t have been made otherwise, basing this partly on what those responsible for those donations said.&#xA0;An uncertain question is how much difference was made by the choice of charity (deworming for Theron and AMF for Peter). As I&#x2019;ve said, the fact that a friend was making the ask and had chosen this particular charity was plausibly dominant, but these were clearly causes that people were happy to give $20 or $200 to, and it&#x2019;s hard not to think that the figures Theron and Peter were able to cite made a difference.</p>\n<p>If you&#x2019;d like to see if you can emulate Theron and Peter&#x2019;s success - and help a great many people in the process - then you can sign up to run a <span><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fbirthday.causevox.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNHCLB57z1I-MD8GiJoJBXoTEGCZ0w\">birthday</a></span>&#xA0;or <span><a href=\"http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fchristmas.causevox.com%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNG71jPzXp-6jQIlevG03MXamvhBSg\">Christmas</a></span>&#xA0;fundraiser.

That is, it would be permissible and perhaps also morally better to give more, but not wrong to refuse to do this &#x2013; giving still more would be going beyond the call of duty.&#xA0; And although they&#x2019;re in the minority, there are some who think that every act of self-sacrifice is supererogatory, no matter how small the sacrifice and no matter how greatly others would benefit.</p>\n<p>When it&#x2019;s supererogatory, or morally optional, <em>whether</em> to give your $200 to charity or instead keep it for yourself, does it follow that it&#x2019;s morally optional <em>where </em>you give your $200, if you do give it to charity?&#xA0; Many seem tempted to accept this inference, but I don&#x2019;t think we should. &#xA0;(<span>See note 1</span>.)</p>\n<p>Consider a thought-experiment.&#xA0; There is 1 person drowning in West Lake and 100 people drowning just to the east in East Lake.&#xA0; If you were at the same latitude as these lakes, it&#x2019;d be virtually costless to save the 1 and virtually costless to save the 100, but impossible to save all 101 (you can launch a rescue boat into one lake or the other).&#xA0; Unfortunately you&#x2019;re 50 miles south of the lakes, and it&#x2019;d cost you $200 (including inconvenience) to travel up to them.&#xA0; Assume it&#x2019;s supererogatory to incur the $200 cost to travel north.&#xA0; Nonetheless, it seems that if you <em>did </em>travel north and were at the same latitude as both lakes, you&#x2019;d be morally required to save the 100 people in East Lake over the 1 in West Lake.&#xA0; (Once you&#x2019;re up there, it feels like you&#x2019;re in a simple <a href=\"http://individual.utoronto.ca/stafforini/parfit/parfit_-_innumerate_ethics.pdf\">&#x201C;save the greater number&#x201D; case</a>.)&#xA0; In this example, it&#x2019;d be morally optional whether to travel up to the lakes, but <em>not</em> morally optional where to offer assistance once there. &#xA0;(<span>See note 2</span>.)</p>\n<p>One might object that this isn&#x2019;t how giving to charity typically works.&#xA0; It&#x2019;s not as if you first pay $200 to some meta-charity, and subsequently decide whether it goes to charity X or to charity Y.&#xA0; Instead, typically the reality is that whether to donate and where to donate are bundled together in a single choice:&#xA0; you can donate $0, donate $200 <em>to charity X</em>, or donate $200 <em>to charity Y</em>.</p>\n<p>In response, I could revise the thought-experiment:&#xA0; West Lake and East Lake are 100 miles apart, and you&#x2019;re right in between them.&#xA0; You could pay $200 to go west (where you could virtually costlessly save 1) or you could instead pay $200 to go east (where you could virtually costlessly save 100).&#xA0; Again, you can&#x2019;t save all 101.&#xA0; Again, we&#x2019;re supposing it&#x2019;s morally optional whether to incur the cost of $200 at all.&#xA0; But it doesn&#x2019;t follow that <em>if</em> you are going to incur this cost, it is morally optional whether you head east or west.&#xA0; On the contrary, it seems that if you <em>are</em> going to incur this cost and end up at one lake or the other, you are morally required to go east where you&#x2019;d do much more good.&#xA0; And this does appear analogous to situations we&#x2019;re often in with regard to charitable donation.&#xA0; While you might not be morally required to give your $200 to charity, if you <em>are</em> going to donate it, and you have the choice between a charity X that would use it to save 1 life and a charity Y that would use it to save 100 lives, you should donate to charity Y (<span>see note 3</span>).&#xA0; (Where this &#x201C;should&#x201D; entails that it would be wrong of you not to donate to charity Y.)</p>\n<p>One might reasonably ask what it is that ultimately <em>makes</em> it permissible not to donate the $200 at all &#x2013; for it could turn out that whatever this is would in turn make it permissible to donate to charity X as well as permissible to donate to charity Y.&#xA0; I believe a defensible answer is that your own well-being (and <a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2014/10/people-and-charitable-causes-are-importantly-different-things/\">perhaps also the well-being of those near and dear to you</a>) generates special permission for you to act in a way that is not optimal from a fully impartial perspective.&#xA0; Perhaps you&#x2019;d be permitted to save yourself (or your loved one) over 100 strangers.&#xA0; But suppose you&#x2019;ve decided to donate your $200 to &#x201C;charity,&#x201D; where this refers to a long disjunction of particular charities A, B, C, &#x2026;X, Y, Z, none of which would, if donated to, benefit you (or anyone near and dear to you).&#xA0; Indeed, this is a fairly realistic situation for donors to find themselves in &#x2013; as so many charities help distant needy strangers.&#xA0; Thus we can see that it doesn&#x2019;t follow from the claim that it&#x2019;s morally optional whether to give that it&#x2019;s morally optional where to give.</p>\n<p>Next one might object that what makes it permissible for you not to donate the $200 at all is simply a matter of your <em>desires</em>.&#xA0; The thought continues:&#xA0; If you desire to &#x201C;donate&#x201D; the money to <em>yourself </em>(or to a friend, a family member, a restaurant server, etc.), it&#x2019;s permissible to do so, and so similarly if you desire to donate the money to charity X rather than the much more cost-effective charity Y, it&#x2019;s likewise permissible to do so.&#xA0; But unless the frustration of your desire to give to charity X constitutes a genuine cost to you, the second half of the previous sentence is very implausible.&#xA0; If you could costlessly save the 1 in West Lake or costlessly save the 100 in East Lake, it wouldn&#x2019;t be permissible to save the 1 in West Lake merely in virtue of your desire to do so.&#xA0; If on the other hand the frustration of your desire to give to charity X did constitute a genuine cost to you (as certain desire-satisfaction theories of well-being imply), then perhaps it&#x2019;d be permissible to give to charity X.&#xA0; But it&#x2019;s worth noticing that <em>apart from your having this desire</em> there&#x2019;s nothing costlier to you about you giving to charity X rather than charity Y, and charity Y is much better from an impartial point of view.&#xA0; Insofar as changing your desire is itself costless to you (or perhaps it&#x2019;d even be beneficial to you to bring your desires closer into alignment with reason!) it&#x2019;s plausible that you <em>should</em> desire giving to Y instead of X.&#xA0; (This isn&#x2019;t to say you should give to Y, assuming your desires haven&#x2019;t yet changed.)</p>\n<p>Finally, as before, there remains the simple point that, while you may have a desire to donate your $200 to yourself over giving it to charity, your desires themselves may be neutral when it comes to selecting between particular charities A through Z.&#xA0; This happens often enough.&#xA0; And so in these cases permission not to donate wouldn&#x2019;t imply that it&#x2019;s permissible to donate to any charity, given that one does choose to donate to charity.</p>\n<p>Many people give to charity (and not just to &#x201C;charity&#x201D; but also to friends, family, etc.) not on the basis of <em>mere</em> desires, or whims, but on the basis of deep emotional connections and commitments.&#xA0; Perhaps the basis of your permission whether, and where, to give isn&#x2019;t simply a matter of your desires, but rather of what&#x2019;s <em>close to your heart</em>.&#xA0; Perhaps deep emotional connections can generate such permissions.&#xA0; But first, even if so, this wouldn&#x2019;t support a general inference from &#x201C;permissibility whether to give&#x201D; to &#x201C;permissibility where to give,&#x201D; since there will remain cases in which your emotional connections are neutral with respect to the particular charities you can donate to. &#xA0;And second, surely there are <em>limits</em> on the sort of permission that emotional connections could plausibly generate &#x2013; they can&#x2019;t plausibly permit you to act in ways that are <em>much </em>worse from an impartial standpoint.&#xA0; Return to the West Lake versus East Lake example.&#xA0; Suppose you&#x2019;ve worked as a lifeguard for West Lake for many years, and have a serious emotional connection and commitment to helping people there.&#xA0; You can save 1 person drowning there, or save 100 people drowning in East Lake (all strangers to you).&#xA0; It seems implausible that the fact that helping people in West Lake is closer to your heart could permit you to save the 1 over the 100.&#xA0; Should it matter if we replaced &#x201C;helping people in West Lake&#x201D; with &#x201C;helping people in the United States&#x201D; or &#x201C;helping people who have suffered from some illness you&#x2019;re especially emotionally connected to (such as cancer)?&#x201D; &#xA0;I do not believe so.&#xA0; But just how strong must the emotional connection or commitment be to generate significant permissions whether and where to give, and just what are the limits of the permissions generated? &#xA0;These are difficult questions I won&#x2019;t be able to settle here.</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;ve been discussing where you should donate your money, assuming that it&#x2019;s permissible for you not to donate to charity at all (either because you&#x2019;ve already given so much or because the duty of beneficence is very undemanding).&#xA0; I&#x2019;ve argued that at least as long as you&#x2019;re donating to charities that are equally good from the standpoint of your own interests (and the interests of those near and dear to you, and your desires, and what&#x2019;s close to your heart), you should donate to the ones that do the most good from an impartial standpoint.&#xA0; The moral option not to give to charity at all doesn&#x2019;t entail that it&#x2019;s morally optional where to give.&#xA0; But for all that, probably most of us would have to give considerably more before the moral option not to give kicks in. &#xA0;I suspect the truth is that <a href=\"http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/0195108590.001.0001/acprof-9780195108590\">the duty of beneficence is pretty demanding by comparison with commonsense standards</a>, and that few of us really do give enough.&#xA0; I doubt I do.</p>\n<p><em>I am grateful to Caley Anderson, Tom Ash, Gulzaar Barn, Roger Crisp, Michelle Hutchinson, Brian McElwee, Andreas Mogensen, Caleb Ontiveros, and Peter Singer for helpful discussions.</em></p>\n<p><span>Notes</span>:</p>\n<p>1. &#xA0;Some qualifications:&#xA0; First, I am not here discussing&#xA0;<em>legal&#xA0;</em>options or rights; if there weren&#x2019;t and ought not to be laws compelling people to donate money to&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.oxfam.org/\">Oxfam</a>, this wouldn&#x2019;t settle the question of whether it&#x2019;s&#xA0;<em>morally</em>&#xA0;optional to donate there.&#xA0; Second, though the following discussion is couched in terms of saving lives,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2014/11/what-kind-of-altruism-is-most-effective/\">it&#x2019;s highly debatable whether life-saving charities are best from an impartial point of view</a>.&#xA0; Arguably, charities that primarily improve quality of life (such as&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.evidenceaction.org/deworm-the-world/\">deworming charities</a>) are better.&#xA0; It&#x2019;s also worth considering charities that focus on&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/\">animal well-being</a>.&#xA0; My examples could be revised accordingly without damage to the main argument.&#xA0; Third, I recognize that there is a lot of uncertainty about what charities are best or &#x201C;do the most good&#x201D; from an impartial point of view.&#xA0; More radically, it may be indeterminate which are best, or perhaps none is&#xA0;<em>best</em>&#xA0;but several very good charities are&#xA0;<a href=\"http://ruthchang.net/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/THE-POSSIBILITY-OF-PARITY.pdf\">on a par</a>; I believe the main points of this post are consistent with these possibilities.&#xA0; Importantly, it remains the case that some charities are much better than many others.</p>\n<p>2. &#xA0;I&#x2019;m not the first to offer examples illustrating this point.&#xA0; In&#xA0;<em><a href=\"http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/0198239165.001.0001/acprof-9780198239161\">The Limits of Morality</a></em>&#xA0;(p.16), Shelly Kagan imagines that you find a building on fire, and are told that someone may still be trapped inside. &#xA0;Plausibly, it is permissible for you not to enter the building to try to rescue them. &#xA0;Suppose, however, that you do enter the building and find a child and a caged bird; you can rescue one or the other, not both.&#xA0; Plausibly, it would be wrong to save the bird rather than the child, though it would not have been wrong for you to have refused to save the child by refusing to enter the building out of concern for your own safety.&#xA0; (In Kagan&#x2019;s example the cost to you is much greater than the cost to you in the lakes example, as well as greater than the cost to you in more everyday cases of donating to charity.)</p>\n<p>3. &#xA0;Typically it costs considerably more money than this to save lives.&#xA0; Arguably the most cost-effective life-saving charity (<a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/Default.aspx\">the Against Malaria Foundation</a>) saves a life roughly every $3,000 received.</p>\n<!-- /article-content --></div></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Tom_Ash"}}, {"_id": "PY5t76osnkAJyZget", "title": "Can you think of any fundraising ideas?", "postedAt": "2014-12-17T19:51:45.403Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><span>As many of you will know, Charity Science, the EA organisation that I work for, focuses on fundraising for GiveWell-recommended charities.

For example, <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a> has found that distributing some <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF\">600 bed nets, at a cost of $3,000, can prevent one infant dying of malaria</a>. For the same price, they have also found you could deliver <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative\">6,000 deworming treatments that work for around a year</a>.</p>\n<p>A common question at this point is &apos;how can you compare the value of helping these different people in these different ways?&apos; Even if the numbers are accurate, how could anyone determine which of these two possible donations helps others the most?</p>\n<p>I can&apos;t offer a philosophically rigorous answer here, but I can tell you how I personally approach this puzzle. I ask myself the question:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Which would I prefer, if, after making the decision, I were equally likely to become any one of the people affected, and experience their lives as they would? [1]</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Let&apos;s work through this example. First, we&apos;ll make the number of people we are considering a manageable number: for $5, I could offer 10 children deworming treatments, or alternatively offer 1 child a bed-net, which has a 1 in 600 chance of saving their life. To make this decision, I should compare three options:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>I don&apos;t donate, and so none of the 11 children receive any help</li>\n<li>Ten of the children receive deworming treatment, but the other one goes without a bed-net</li>\n<li>The one child receives a bed-net, but the other ten go without deworming</li>\n</ol>\n<div>If I didn&apos;t know which of these 11 children I was about to become, which choice would be more appealing?</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>Obviously 2 and 3 are better than 1 (no help), but deciding between 2 and 3 is not so simple. I am confident that a malaria net is more helpful than a deworming tablet, but it is ten times more useful?</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>This question has the virtue of:</div>\n<div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>Being &apos;fair&apos;, because in theory everyone&apos;s interests are given &apos;<em>equal consideration</em>&apos;</li>\n<li>Putting the focus on how much the <em>recipients&apos; value the help</em>, rather than how you feel about it as a donor</li>\n<li><em>Motivating you to actually try</em> to figure out the answer, by putting you in the shoes of the people you are trying to help.</li>\n</ul>\n<div>You&apos;ll notice that this approach looks a lot like the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance\">veil of ignorance</a>, a popular method among moral philosophers for determine whether a process or outcome is &apos;just&apos;. It should also be very appealing to any consequentialist who cares about &apos;wellbeing&apos;, and thinks everyone&apos;s interests ought to be weighed equally. [2] It also looks very much like the ancient instruction to &quot;<em><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule\">love your neighbor as yourself</a></em>&quot;.</div>\n</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>In my experience, this thought experiment pushes you towards asking good concrete questions like:</div>\n<div>\n<ul>\n<li>How much would deworming improve my quality of life immediately, and then in the long term?</li>\n<li>How harmful is it for an infant to die? How painful is it to suffer from a case of malaria?</li>\n<li>What risk of death might I be willing to tolerate to get the long-term health and incomes gains offered by deworming?</li>\n<li>And so on.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n</ul>\n<div>I find the main weakness of applying this approach is that thousands of people might be affected in some way by a decision. For instance, we should not only consider the harm to young children who die of preventable diseases, but also the grief and hardship experienced by their families as a result. But that&apos;s just the start: health treatments delivered today will change the rate of economic development in a country and therefore the quality of life of all future generations. A big part of the <a href=\"http://eml.berkeley.edu/~emiguel/pdfs/miguel_wormsatwork.pdf\">case for deworming</a> is that it improves nutrition, and thereby raises education levels and incomes for people when they are adults - benefits that are then passed on to their children and their children&apos;s children.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>This doesn&apos;t make this question the wrong one to ask, but rather that tracking and weighing the impact on the hundreds of people who might be affected by an action is beyond what most of us can do in a casual way. However, I find you can still make useful progress by thinking through and adding up the impacts on paper, or in a spreadsheet. [3] When you apply this approach, it is usually possible to narrow down your choices to just a few options, though in my experience you may then not have enough information to confidently decide among that remaining handful.</div>\n<div><br></div>\n</div>\n<div>--</div>\n<div><br></div>\n</div>\n<div>[1] A very similar, probably equivalent, question is: <em>Which would I prefer if, after making the decision, I then had to sequentially experience the remaining lives of everyone affected by both options?</em></div>\n<div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>[2] One weakness is that this question is ambiguous about how to deal with interventions that change who exists (for instance, policies that raise or lower birth rates). If you assume that you must become someone - non-existence is not an option - you would end up adopting the &apos;average view&apos;, which actually has&#xA0;<a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/repugnant-conclusion/#IntNewWayAggWelMeaVal\">no supporters</a> in moral philosophy. If you simply ignored anyone whose existence was conditional on your decision, you would be adopting the &apos;person affecting view&apos;, which itself has <a href=\"http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nonidentity-problem/\">serious problems</a>. If you do include those people in the population of people you could become, and add &apos;non-existence&apos; as the alternative for the choices which cause those people not to exist, you would be adopting the &apos;total view&apos;.</div>\n</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div>[3] Alternatively, if you were convinced that these long-term prosperity effects were the most important impact, and were similarly valuable across countries, you could try to estimate the increase in the rate of economic growth per $100 invested in different projects, and just seek to maximise that.</div>\n<div><br></div></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Robert_Wiblin"}}, {"_id": "WoQ8pub55TNzCjJb8", "title": "Effective Altruism Outreach needs your donations this Christmas!", "postedAt": "2014-12-11T14:54:39.846Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><a href=\"http://eao.causevox.com/\"><img src=\"http://www.nielbowerman.com/content/vox-image.jpg\" alt=\"EA Outreach Fundraising Campaign Page\"></a></p>\n<h2><a href=\"http://eao.causevox.com/\"><strong>Donate now.</strong></a></h2>\n<p>Effective Altruism Outreach is a project within the Centre for Effective Altruism to grow and strengthen the effective altruism movement.</p>\n<p>As part of these efforts, we will be coordinating the launches of two books on effective altruism in 2015: one by William MacAskill, published by Penguin in the US and Guardian Faber in the UK; and another by Peter Singer, published by Yale University Press.

You can measure this in its own units, but whatever you use here will be the units of value that come out in the cost-effectiveness estimate.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>p</span><span> </span><span>and </span><span>y/z</span><span> are parameters that we will estimate together. </span><span>p</span><span> </span><span>is the probability of getting a solution by the time </span><span>y</span><span> resources have been dedicated to the problem, if </span><span>z</span><span> </span><span>resources have been dedicated so far. Note that we only need the ratio </span><span>y/z</span><span>, so we can estimate this directly.</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Although </span><span>y/z</span><span> is hard to estimate, we will take a (natural) logarithm of it, so don&#x2019;t worry too much about making this term precise.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>I think it will often be best to use middling values of </span><span>p</span><span>, perhaps between 0.2 and 0.8.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span>And that&#x2019;s it. </span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<p><span>Example:</span><span> How valuable is extra research into nuclear fusion? Assume:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>R(0) = $5 billion</span><span> (after a quick google turns up $1.5B for current spending, and adjusting upwards to account for non-financial inputs);</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>B = $1000 billion</span><span> (guesswork, a bit over 1% of the world economy; a fraction of the current energy sector);</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>There&#x2019;s a 50% chance of success (</span><span>p = 0.5</span><span>) by the time we&#x2019;ve spent 100 times as many resources as today (</span><span>log(y/z) = log(100) = 4.6</span><span>). </span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div><span><span><br></span></span></div>\n<p><span>Putting these together would give an expected societal benefit of (0.5*$1000B)/(5B*4.6) = </span><span>$22 for every dollar spent</span><span>. This is high enough to suggest that we may be significantly under-investing in fusion, and that a more careful calculation (with better-researched numbers!) might be justified.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Caveats</span></h2>\n<p><span>To get the simple formula, the model made a number of assumptions. Since we&#x2019;re just using it to get rough numbers, it&#x2019;s okay if we don&#x2019;t fit these assumptions exactly, but if they&#x2019;re totally off then the model may be inappropriate. One restriction in particular I&#x2019;d want to bear in mind:</span></p>\n<p><span><br></span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>It should be plausible that we could solve the problem in the next decade or two.</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div><span><span><br></span></span></div>\n<p><span>It&#x2019;s okay if this is unlikely, but I&#x2019;d want to change the model if I were estimating the value of e.g. trying to colonise the stars.</span></p>\n<h2><span>Request for applications</span></h2>\n<p><span>So -- what would you like to apply this method to?

It builds some models which allow principled reasoning about how we should act. These models are quite crude but easy to work with: they are intended to lower the bar for Fermi estimates and similar, and provide a starting point for building more sophisticated models.</li>\n<li><a title=\"Estimating cost-effectiveness for problems of unknown difficulty\" href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/estimating-cost-effectiveness/\">Estimating cost-effectiveness for problems of unknown difficulty</a>&#xA0;picks up from the models in the above post, and asks what they mean for the expected cost-effectiveness of work on the problems. This involves building a model of the counterfactual impact, as solvable research problems are likely to be solved eventually, so the main effect is to move the solution forwards. This post includes several explicit formulae that you can use to produce estimates; it also explains analogies between the explicit model we derive and the qualitative &apos;three factor&apos; model that GiveWell and 80,000 Hours have used for cause selection.</li>\n<li><a title=\"Estimating the cost-effectiveness of research into neglected diseases\" href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/research-into-neglected-diseases/\">Estimating the cost-effectiveness of research into neglected diseases</a>&#xA0;is an investigation by Max Dalton, which uses the techniques for estimating cost-effectiveness to provide ballpark figures for how valuable we should expect research into vaccines or treatments for neglected diseases to be.

Even if you don&#x2019;t share my goal, I&#x2019;d like to share advice that can help you achieve more of what you&#x2019;d like.</p>\n<p><em>Download the </em> <a href=\"http://yboris.com/frugal.pdf\"><em>PDF</em></a> <em> or read:</em></p>\n<p>Frugality is a word that may have several meanings. It could mean not being lavish or extravagant with one&#x2019;s spending, or it could mean avoiding waste, or just being economical of monetary resources. I don&#x2019;t intend to argue for definitions, I&#x2019;d like to share the best advice I&#x2019;ve come across to help you think about using your money wisely.</p>\n<p>Because I am passionate about giving to charities, it&#x2019;s useful for me to be more cautious about spending my money, not just because I have less to spend on myself but also because I can have more of my money left to give. I&#x2019;ve been frugal most my life for various reasons; I now have an excellent reason. Regardless of why you&#x2019;d like to be frugal, I want to help you succeed.</p>\n<p>Personally I see frugality as using your money most effectively to achieve your goals. Because I don&#x2019;t care about television shows I can save money by skipping cable. Someone who enjoys TV too much to give it up may be pleased that Netflix or some other service can provide the same pleasure but for less money; sometimes a substitute service may even end up being a better fit!</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s always great if you can save without giving up something, but it&#x2019;s not always possible; in the end, it&#x2019;s a trade-off between different things you can do with your money. You might save by not watching TV, but be rewarded by having vacation money. Figuring out what you prefer most may be the best step towards smarter spending.</p>\n<p>The most important principle I think everyone should be aware of is that we all have limited amount of money and thus must be discriminate about how to use it. Buying some things will bring us pleasures or allow us to accomplish some of our goals; but that spending necessarily means we&#x2019;ll have less financial resources to spend on other things and other goals. Figure out your goals first!</p>\n<p><strong>Benefits of being frugal:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li> More money left over for things you really care about </li>\n<li> Less things to transport when moving (time and money costs) </li>\n<li> Less things to store when living (maintenance costs) </li>\n<li> Less things to worry about (psychological costs) </li>\n<li> Less environmental impact </li>\n<li> If you choose to eat less, you&#x2019;ll stay healthier and live longer (see: <em>caloric restriction</em>) </li>\n</ul>\n<p><em> What follows is a list of numerous ideas and techniques. I don&#x2019;t use all, nor would I recommend all; but some people found each one very useful on their path to greater frugality. These are not in any particular order.

The reason you want something may be because someone wanted you to want it. Or you might want something because you&#x2019;ve unintentionally joined the never-ending signaling game to show you&#x2019;re &#x2018;better&#x2019; than others (see: <em>conspicuous consumption</em>). </li>\n<li> Avoid being manipulated by ads (don&#x2019;t look at them) </li>\n<li> Become more in control of your life (spend on things that matter, not on frivolous immediate pleasures the companies want you to have) </li>\n<li> Ask &#x201C;is there an alternative way I can spend this money?&#x201D; (aka: <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opportunity_cost\">opportunity cost</a>) </li>\n<li> Ask &#x201C;do I <em>need</em> it?&#x201D; </li>\n<li> Hedonic adaptation aka <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill\">hedonic treadmill</a> (e.g. getting accustomed to fancy wine doesn&#x2019;t make you enjoy it more in the long run, it sets a new, more expensive standard; after a few months you get no more enjoyment than you did with the cheaper wine) </li>\n<li> Living in America you are accustomed to a superbly lavish lifestyle; even a poor lifestyle in America will be akin to a <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/resources/how-rich-you-are.php\">rich life</a> in many other countries, that is when compared to the majority of the world&#x2019;s population </li>\n<li> Delay purchases above $100 by 1 day for every $100 of cost </li>\n<li> Procrastinate on buying (unless you genuinely need the item) </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>General principles:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li> 20/80 &#x2018;rule&#x2019; aka <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle\">Pareto principle</a> (it&#x2019;s possible that 20% of your spending gives you 80% of your pleasure/life satisfaction and 80% of your spending accomplishes only 20% of what you prefer) </li>\n<li> Proportions don&#x2019;t matter, absolute dollars do (saving $50 on a $10,000 purchase is as good as saving $50 on a $100 purchase) </li>\n<li> Repeated purchases add up (e.g. $3+ coffee / day is about $1,000 / year; at this point buying even an expensive coffee machine may be the frugal thing to do) </li>\n<li> Avoid big losses (e.g. traffic tickets, car accidents; it&#x2019;s obvious but by reminding yourself and by forming safer habits and taking safer actions will decrease your chance of such losses. Thousands of examples come to mind: locking a key in the car, forgetting an iPod in public, dropping your wallet) </li>\n<li> Long-term planning is better (e.g. monthly subway pass rather than daily subway pass) </li>\n<li> Spending hours to save pennies is not worth it (be frugal with your limited time) </li>\n<li> Economic efficiency &#x2013; don&#x2019;t spend 10 hours making a trinket you can buy for $50 (and have 10 hours for something you enjoy far more than making the thing) </li>\n<li> Owning less means less upkeep costs (smaller apartment, etc) </li>\n<li> Don&#x2019;t buy what you won&#x2019;t use often (e.g. power tools &#x2013; borrow them) </li>\n<li> For every $1 you save and <a href=\"http://www.moneychimp.com/calculator/compound_interest_calculator.htm\">invest</a>, in 30 years at 8% growth you&#x2019;ll have $10 </li>\n<li> Take the long-term view (don&#x2019;t forget about your future self - a quintessentially rational act) </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Specific advice:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li> Shopping around for a cell phone plan that saves you $5/month means $120 over 2 years (3 hours spent finding such a plan means you earned $40/hour) </li>\n<li> Turn down heat, wear long underwear (why heat the whole house when it&#x2019;s your body you care about?) </li>\n<li> Consider the cost of car per mile (take cost of car and add all maintenance costs you&#x2019;ll need for it until it&#x2019;s dead, divide by the number of miles you expect it to last, add cost of gas, per mile driven. You&#x2019;ll find it&#x2019;s usually no less than $0.25/mile for even cheap new cars; used cars might need more maintenance and could cost more per mile) </li>\n<li> Corollary: Driving 2 extra miles to save $0.05/gallon on gas is stupid </li>\n<li> Decrease your commute time (has other benefits such as a significant boost in happiness) </li>\n<li> Skip cable (use another service like <em>Hulu</em> or <em>Netflix</em>) </li>\n<li> Call your cell company and ask for a decrease in the bill (look for guides how to do this online) </li>\n<li> Don&#x2019;t get into credit card debt (always pay off credit card debt as quickly as possible) </li>\n<li> Don&#x2019;t eat out (cook at home, eating at home will be much cheaper and can be much healthier) </li>\n<li> Don&#x2019;t drink at a bar (drink at home, bar drinks are superbly expensive) </li>\n<li> Buy in-season veggies (cheaper, fresher, more nutritious) </li>\n<li> Bad idea: splurging on a fancy car (may cost you $3,000-$10,000 more), see <em>hedonic adaptation</em>. There are better uses for that money ($1,000 more on a car won&#x2019;t give you as much pleasure as $1,000 spent efficiently on other things). Also you&#x2019;ll pay more in insurance and upkeep and have more worries about it being stolen. </li>\n<li> Buy timeless clothes (those that don&#x2019;t go out of style) </li>\n<li> Shop in second-hand stores (e.g. you could find a $10 jacket that was worn only a few times once cost $200; new-looking $3 bag that cost $50 when new) </li>\n<li> Libraries (free books!) </li>\n<li> Budget your money (be aware where you&#x2019;re spending and on what; <em>mint.com</em> is an excellent tool for this) </li>\n<li> Consider (free or paid) music services rather than music purchases (e.g. <em>di.fm</em>) </li>\n<li> Make sure to cover all necessary payments first with money you earn, before you start spending on non-essentials. </li>\n<li> If you&apos;re impulsive, consider only using cash, withdrawing per-week only what you think is acceptable to spend; leave your credit cards at home. </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Websites:</strong> <br> <em>A short list of websites that can save you money.</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li> Craigslist.org </li>\n<li> Freecycle.org </li>\n<li> Couchsurfing.org </li>\n<li> Swap.com </li>\n<li> Mint.com </li>\n<li> NeighborGoods.net </li>\n<li> Airbnb.com </li>\n<li> Hulu.com </li>\n<li> Netflix.com </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Miscellaneous:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li> Being frugal is easier to start when young </li>\n<li> There is a philosophic tradition of stoicism and asceticism that fits with a frugal lifestyle </li>\n<li> Some people claim to dislike work, but then spend money on useless things; another option is to spend less so you can work less (and have more free time for things you really like) </li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Sticking to your goals:</strong></p>\n<p><em> Even if you resolve to be frugal, it&#x2019;s now a matter of putting your desires and goals into practice; for that you need a set of tricks to refrain from compulsive or impulsive spending. </em></p>\n<ul>\n<li> Avoid looking at advertisements </li>\n<li> Don&#x2019;t go into a store without a clear idea of what you need </li>\n<li> Don&#x2019;t shop for food on a hungry stomach </li>\n<li> Make it a habit (habits take time to form, a good guess is it takes between 30 and 60 days) </li>\n<li> Make absolute rules (e.g. &#x201C;I will not spend more than $X on habit Y&#x201D;) </li>\n<li> Make flexible rules (e.g. &#x201C;every time I refrain from buying X, I have more money for Y&#x201D;) </li>\n<li> Remind yourself about avoiding big losses (e.g. &#x201C;driving faster can get me an expensive ticket&#x201D;) </li>\n<li> Remind yourself of what you really care about (e.g. &#x201C;With every $1 I save, I can donate to a cost-effective charity like SCI and <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative\">cure a child of parasitic worms</a>&#x201D;) </li>\n</ul></body></html>", "user": {"username": "yboris"}}, {"_id": "z2nKz3kSBWxuxahBJ", "title": "How much attention does climate change warrant?

A Conversation with Climate Scientist and Energy Technology and Public Policy Expert David Keith</strong></p>\n<p>David Keith is Professor of Applied Physics in the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences and Professor of Public Policy at the Harvard Kennedy School. His academic work currently focuses on solar geoengineering: assessments of the technology, public engagement with its social consequences, and the development of related public policies and governance mechanisms. Following years of research on direct air capture, Keith founded and currently serves as president of Carbon Engineering, a Calgary-based start-up that works on capturing carbon dioxide from ambient air to produce low carbon fuels for transportation on an industrial scale. Keith also co-manages the Fund for Innovative Climate and Energy Research, a multimillion-dollar philanthropic geoengineering research fund established by Microsoft founder Bill Gates. Keith was named Canadian Geographic&#x2019;s Environmental Scientist of the Year in 2006 and one of TIME magazine&#x2019;s Heroes of the Environment in 2009.</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://harvardea.org/assets/img/2014-12-04/keith.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p><strong>HEA</strong>: How much effort should we devote to combatting climate change in relation to more immediate issues like infectious diseases?</p>\n<p>Keith: If all you care about is direct measurable human welfare, measured by how long people are going to live or whether or not they can get enough basic materials, then I think climate change is not as high priority as pollution and other social problems we face. I think climate is an environmental problem, so for lots of reasons I would like to leave more of the natural world to be enjoyed by my great grand kids and everybody else&#x2019;s. I think there is some real value to not egregiously messing with this wondrous thing that we&#x2019;ve inherited, but I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s because we need it that much. Some people want to say that the reason we should protect the climate is purely for utilitarian practical reasons: we have to do it because otherwise there is an existential threat. I don&#x2019;t see much evidence for that from climate change.</p>\n<p><strong>HEA</strong>: Won&#x2019;t climate change result in severe consequences for humanity?</p>\n<p>Keith: Severe compared to what, for whom, and at what time scale? Humans are moving extraordinarily fast and causing extraordinary impact on human welfare. I worked on climate change for half of my life myself; I care about it. I just think that claims that you could compare it directly with some other threads are overblown. Take sea-level rise as an example: a two meter rise, which is a very high-end estimate, actually will occur really slowly compared to other social factors. Yes that means Miami won&#x2019;t be there, but big deal. People don&#x2019;t think through how big the other changes are going to be in the next two centuries. In terms of direct impact on human welfare, I would think that changes due to Southern Florida going gradually under sea level over a hundred years won&#x2019;t kill anybody directly, and real estate values really aren&#x2019;t meaningfully valued on that time scale. I personally think that it&#x2019;s an outrageous idea that we would let the world be damaged that much, but I don&#x2019;t think that the reason is the standard economist rationalization for why we should act on climate change: add up all the damages from sea level rise and whatnot and the cost of control, with discounting over time, and calculate the optimum. Under that story people like me care about climate change because we are going to make our grand kids one or two percent richer because the amount that we save from climate damages is larger than the cost to cut emissions. I find that utterly unconvincing. If the answer were the opposite, if I were to make people one percent poorer to deal with climate change, I would still want to do it for reasons that aren&#x2019;t captured by economic calculations.</p>\n<p><strong>HEA</strong>: Could you comment on the general state of climate policy today?</p>\n<p>Keith: The general state of climate policy is that it&#x2019;s not going very far. Nothing much is happening. But things might happen. I&#x2019;ve been involved with this for over a quarter of a century and people always think that things are going to happen and I don&#x2019;t expect anything dramatic to happen, to say Paris, next year. I think that there will be announcements that make it sound good, but I&#x2019;m skeptical that something really dramatic will happen. I think the underlying reasons why it&#x2019;s hard to get a deal are deep, and they are not to do with opposition by this or that ugly fossil fuel company. This is not to say there isn&#x2019;t that opposition, there absolute is and it&#x2019;s awful, but it&#x2019;s to do with the fact that the costs of cutting emissions are paid for locally while the benefits are felt a hundred years in the future. It&#x2019;s the time and space aspect. We&#x2019;ve dealt with externalities: in the developed world we have done an extraordinary job in improving air quality, improving water quality, toxin, DDT, and we&#x2019;ve dealt with externalities that were one or two percent of GDP. China now is facing externalities from air pollution of several percent of GDP and China will very certainly deal with those&#xA0;<span>because</span>&#xA0;if the Chinese government imposes these big costs the generation that pays the cost of emission controls will see their air get cleaner and there is a basic political deal there. But climate isn&#x2019;t like that because of the very very long time delays and the global aspect.</p>\n<p><strong>HEA</strong>: Is solar geoengineering a suitable backup plan if policy changes fail us?</p>\n<p><strong>Keith</strong>: Solar geo-engineering seems to act quickly and, from current evidence, has pretty widespread benefits, making it likely that politicians will ultimately do it, and it doesn&#x2019;t require a global agreement that cutting emissions does.</p>\n<p>But in the end you have to bring the emissions to zero to stabilize climate. No amount of solar engineering can solve that problem. If you don&#x2019;t restrain emissions you don&#x2019;t have a stable climate. And I&#x2019;m just making an observation that I think politicians should react. I didn&#x2019;t say anything about what I think the right answer was and I have no idea what promising means in this context.</p>\n<p><strong>HEA</strong>: You have conducted research on whether patents on solar geoengineering technologies could be banned and advocated for keeping these technologies in the public domain. What are the dangers of privatizing solar geoengineering?</p>\n<p><strong>Keith</strong>: With incredibly technologies like this you could destroy the world. You don&#x2019;t want private enterprise making nuclear weapons, and you don&#x2019;t want that with geo-engineering. The decisions could impact the whole world and need to be taken as legitimately and as transparently as possible and that&#x2019;s not what companies do. For these public policy matters, it&#x2019;s important to discourage private enterprise and business involvement in solar geo-engineering because it has such potentially high leverage and therefore presents such a threat. The incentive to distort the facts about it would be so large so I&#x2019;m strongly against doing that in a for profit mode.</p>\n<p><strong>HEA</strong>: Where should people put their money to see environmental change?</p>\n<p><strong>Keith</strong>: To me I&#x2019;m less excited by the big environmental NGOs, which seem a bit too business like and too captured inside the old way, so I&#x2019;m more excited by some of the new ideas of how to mobilize people that are like 350.org, and the divestment movement, but there&#x2019;s a whole lot of things. Personally when I give money, I give money to lobbying organizations that will change laws because I think the way we are going to restrain carbon emissions is through changing people&#x2019;s attitudes and laws and I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s through encouraging behavior that would lower individual carbon footprints because we need to bring emissions to zero and people are not going to bring their consumption to zero; you are going to do that through technological change: switching to more efficient vehicles, solar power, nuclear power what have you. So I think it&#x2019;s very important to have non-governmental organizations and environmental groups fight to have these regulations passed.</p>\n<p><strong>HEA</strong>: What are some of the most effective ways of changing the mindset of politicians and the population regarding climate change and the actions we should take?</p>\n<p><strong>Keith</strong>: These things depend on social movements! I&#x2019;m really excited by the students here who are are involved with the divestment movement. I think divestment narrowly draws, if nothing else, changes, and of course the critics are right in that it won&#x2019;t do much but the point of the divestment movement is trying to be really clear about what the long term consequences of our choices are with regard to carbon and what the impact of that is and to try and hold senior decision makers including the big investors and senior people who run Harvard accountable for that, and I think it&#x2019;s fantastic. I think it&#x2019;s part of an attempt to make a social movement that spreads more broadly the idea that people really have to demand to change, to restrain the amount of carbon emissions. I think these things are absolutely and inherently political and should not be decided in some cold analytic way. Indeed a lot of last decade&#x2019;s policies been done too much by professionals who suppose they could calculate their way into the right answer and we need more activism.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Ales_Flidr"}}]
