[I recommend you update <i><strong>moderately</strong></i> for this point]</li><li>EAIF has outlined a specific strategy which they didn't have at the time. When they had a broader remit, it was presumably harder for them to make effective decisions. [I recommend you update <i><strong>moderately</strong></i> for this point]</li><li>Although I <i>did</i> point out that other EA money might fund the project, and I did ask for feedback to help stop that money going to this project if it weren't high impact enough, when the fund manager didn't feel able to provide a rationale for rejection, I didn't then push for the Fund to provide us with funding. I felt this would have violated norms of respecting their decision. However doing so might have caused them to come up with reasons which they didn't state in the call. Overall, I find this less convincing, because if they did come up with more reasons, then they would have had to essentially contradict themselves, which means my conclusion of low confidence in their decision-making remains unchanged.

Also, I appreciate the details here are (deliberately) vague enough that it will be hard for the fund managers to identify the case or respond.
