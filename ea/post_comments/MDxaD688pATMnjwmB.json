First of all, you studied support for effective giving (EG), which is different from effective altruism as a whole. I would suspect at least the following three factors to really be different between EG and EA:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for cause impartiality, both moral impartiality (measuring each being according to their innate characteristics like sentience or intelligence, rather than personal closeness) and means impartiality (being indifferent between different means to an end, e.g. donating money or choosing a career with direct impact</li>\n<li>Dedication. I believe that making career changes or pledging at least 10% of your income to donate is quite a high bar and much fewer people would be inclined to that.</li>\n<li>Involvement in the community. As you wrote the community is quite idiosyncratic. Openness to (some of) its ideas does not imply people will like the movement.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Of course, not all of this implies that the study is worthless, that getting people to donate their 1 or 2% more effectively is useless, or that we shouldn't try to make the movement more diverse and welcoming (if this can be done without compromising core values such as epistemic rigor). I think there is a debate to be held how to differentiate effective giving from EA as a whole, so that we can decide whether or not to promote effective giving seperately and if so, how.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "SiebeRozendal"}}, {"_id": "NfQtEqD6CQSc2xGHN", "postedAt": "2018-06-07T11:14:36.335Z", "postId": "MDxaD688pATMnjwmB", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks both, great point. We focused the description in this study on the effective giving and career choice aspects of EA, and the results may well be different depending on the framing -- it'd be worth replicating with something like x-risk. Here's the full description (built from ea.org): </p>\n<p>&quot;What is Effective Altruism? Thinking carefully about how to do good. Effective altruism is about answering one simple question: how can we use our resources to help others the most? Rather than just doing what feels right, we use evidence and careful analysis to find the very best causes to work on.</p>\n<p>Most of us want to make a difference. We see suffering, injustice and death, and are moved to do something about them. But working out what that \u2018something\u2019 is, let alone doing it, is a difficult problem.\nWhich cause should you support if you really want to make a difference? What career choices will help you make a significant contribution? Which charities will use your donation effectively? If you don\u2019t choose well, you risk wasting your time and money. But if you choose wisely, you have a tremendous chance to improve the world.</p>\n<p>Effective altruism considers tradeoffs like the following: Suppose we want to fight blindness. For $40,000 we can provide guide dogs to blind people in the US. Or for $20 per patient, we can pay for surgery reversing the effects of trachoma in Africa (a disease which causes blindness). If people have equal moral value, then the second option is more than 2,000 times better than the first.&quot;</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "ZKdkrKqgqjkyzo3T5", "user": {"username": "NickFitz"}}, {"_id": "4AkeL5aNaW2C2XyWJ", "postedAt": "2018-06-07T11:39:06.092Z", "postId": "MDxaD688pATMnjwmB", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for this. The SEGS consisted of seven items on a 7-point Likert agree/disagree scale: (1) I am interested in Effective Altruism, (2) I would like to learn more about Effective Altruism, (3) I support the Effective Altruism movement, (4), I would share information about Effective Altruism with people in my network, (5) I identify as an &quot;effective altruist,&quot; (6) I would like to meet others who support Effective Altruism, and (7) I will donate my money based on Effective Altruism. We also measured a few more-behavioral outcomes e.g., a windfall donation task (in which participants allocated money between Deworm the World, Make a Wish, a local choir, and keeping it for themselves), and willingness to sign the GWWC pledge. For the SEGS x Empathy relationship, we controlled for past giving behavior to try to feather that out. </p>\n<p>Ah yes, the links to the scales don't appear to work in the PDF, here are open-access versions:</p>\n<p>EQ: <a href=\"http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2004_Lawrence_etal_MeasuringEmpathy.pdf\">http://docs.autismresearchcentre.com/papers/2004_Lawrence_etal_MeasuringEmpathy.pdf</a></p>\n<p>IRI: <a href=\"http://fetzer.org/sites/default/files/images/stories/pdf/selfmeasures/EMPATHY-InterpersonalReactivityIndex.pdf\">http://fetzer.org/sites/default/files/images/stories/pdf/selfmeasures/EMPATHY-InterpersonalReactivityIndex.pdf</a></p>\n<p>MFQ-20: <a href=\"http://www.moralfoundations.org/questionnaires\">http://www.moralfoundations.org/questionnaires</a> </p>\n<p>TIPI: <a href=\"https://gosling.psy.utexas.edu/scales-weve-developed/ten-item-personality-measure-tipi/\">https://gosling.psy.utexas.edu/scales-weve-developed/ten-item-personality-measure-tipi/</a> </p>\n<p>MS-S: <a href=\"http://journal.sjdm.org/16/16129b/jdm16129b.pdf\">http://journal.sjdm.org/16/16129b/jdm16129b.pdf</a> </p>\n<p>CRT: <a href=\"http://journal.sjdm.org/15/151029/jdm151029.pdf\">http://journal.sjdm.org/15/151029/jdm151029.pdf</a></p>\n", "parentCommentId": "EzA3NixNcE2WnztEs", "user": {"username": "NickFitz"}}, {"_id": "cofcRGnHRfeE6YZTE", "postedAt": "2018-06-07T11:42:15.647Z", "postId": "MDxaD688pATMnjwmB", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Siebe - it's definitely worth distinguishing effective giving, career choice, x-risk, etc. There's likely a whole host of factors that differ between them.
