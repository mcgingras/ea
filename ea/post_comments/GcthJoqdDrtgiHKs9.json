Slum conditions currently do not support a healthy or high-quality life. This is a very important issue.\nTractability:&nbsp;Slum policy interventions appear relatively intractable. In contrast,&nbsp;In situ&nbsp;slum upgrading interventions largely deliver cost-effective results, but more research is needed.</p>\n<p>[...]</p>\n<p>As slums grow at an alarming rate, a better understanding of problems uniquely faced by slum populations is required. For this to happen, governments must consider slums as spatial entities and collect more extensive census data, while academia may contribute by focusing research directly on slum health.\"</p>\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/sgkvhJLFMDzBPgovp/shallow-investigation-slums\">https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/sgkvhJLFMDzBPgovp/shallow-investigation-slums</a></p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": null}, {"_id": "PTYm7GgSvodRnwtpK", "postedAt": "2023-05-19T16:54:32.459Z", "postId": "GcthJoqdDrtgiHKs9", "htmlBody": "<p>Normally I'd say yes, but my AGI timelines are now 50% in ~4 years, so there isn't much time for R&amp;D to make a difference.
