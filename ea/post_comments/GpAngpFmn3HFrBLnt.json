Or is this something that you could scale to other countries? Or could be done by desk-based researchers elsewhere?</p><p>I have also done some NGO/charitable/public sector mapping in Uganda and just remember it being an absolute nightmare driving around trying to work out which places were still open, had ever existed, or were open to our user base. Huge props to you guys for doing this work and I'm interested to follow its progress when you start talking to other orgs :)</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Joe Pusey"}}, {"_id": "T6WJByEvmc4SgDXeJ", "postedAt": "2023-08-18T09:17:11.076Z", "postId": "GpAngpFmn3HFrBLnt", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks, Joseph for the great question.</p><p>Health AIM can definitely be used by desk-based researchers, even if you have never been to Uganda our tool can help you understand the healthcare situation here.</p><p>The idea for the prototype came through our in-depth knowledge of the health service demand in Northern Uganda, and our mission to reach every healthcare \"<strong>black hole</strong>\" with quality healthcare.
