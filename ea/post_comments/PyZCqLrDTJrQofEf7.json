I think that the question posed somehow cannot be answered by a natural-science based approach, that it's one to be approached best by the tools of history or maybe IR rather than power distributions, as a eras change, even between WWI, WWII and 2022, and big wars are quite sui generis events. A parameter that I would like to see in such an analysis would be how much more interconnected our world is at present and that it may get in the future. Here's two examples from the present: a) the energy situation affecting Europe, and the economic effects of the Ukraine war, and b) internet use - imagine if a rogue country had in its tactics to cut internet supply or attack nuclear facilities or hospitals through cyberwarfare. Or, imagine worse, if the AI you mentioned is linked to the internet and some state hackers decide to hack them, without knowing for example how crazy the AI would go if hacked (ok, i'm stretching it a bit here).&nbsp;<br><br><br>I think more useful a more useful lead from your article is the mention of the democratization and the turning of the tide with citizens not willing to fight in really big and protracted wars (i guess the extinction war would have to escalate a bit before it reaches doomsday point, even though I wouldn't rule out the accidental escalation that would lead to the nuclear winter in like a week or so - I can even see a quick escalation over Taiwan or sth, i hope i'm just naive).&nbsp;<br><br>Anyway, this was just a ramble, I apologise for this, the key takeaway from the above that I'd love to discuss with you is that I don't think that power-laws can say much about a war leading to human extinction.&nbsp;On the contrary, history and perhaps psychology (the decisions of those a) deciding politics b) creating weapons and c) using weapons) could be more useful guides.<br><br>Best Wishes,<br>Haris</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Haris Shekeris"}}, {"_id": "tRh2SJcorMgXCuS6f", "postedAt": "2022-11-08T10:29:14.728Z", "postId": "PyZCqLrDTJrQofEf7", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Haris, thanks for this.
