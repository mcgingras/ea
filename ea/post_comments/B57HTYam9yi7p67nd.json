The honors program of a 50,000-student campus is likely to have an aggregation of talent that rivals that of the Ivies. Liberal-arts colleges in the boondocks, with their paucity of non-academic diversions, can nurture a student culture that is more engaged with ideas and books. The PhD glut has sent brilliant scientists and humanists into every outpost of the academic archipelago. And in many fields the best programs are at lesser-known universities, which can nimbly expand into new intellectual frontiers while their Ivy League counterparts, stultified by tradition and cushioned by reputation, become backwaters.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Still, there are no grounds for the sweeping pronouncements about the virtues of non-Ivy students (\u201cmore interesting, more curious, more open, and far less entitled and competitive\u201d) that Deresiewicz prestidigitates out of thin air. It\u2019s these schools, after all, that are famous for their jocks, stoners, Bluto Blutarskys, gut-course-hunters, term-paper-downloaders, and majors in such intellectually challenging fields as communications, marketing, and sports management. In another use of the argument \u201cIf I say it, it\u2019s true,\u201d Deresiewicz decrees that obscure religious colleges \u201cdo a much better job\u201d in teaching their students \u201chow to think,\u201d and that they \u201cdeliver a better education, in the highest sense of the word\u201d than elite universities\u2014and then, breathtakingly, elevates an assertion that was based on nothing but his say-so (and that is almost certainly false) into an \u201cindictment of the Ivy League and his peers.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>But the biggest problem is that the advice in Deresiewicz\u2019s title is perversely wrongheaded. If your kid has survived the application ordeal and has been offered a place at an elite university, don\u2019t punish her for the irrationalities of a system she did nothing to create; by all means send her there! The economist Caroline Hoxby has shown that selective universities spend twenty times more on student instruction, support, and facilities than less selective ones, while their students pay for a much smaller fraction of it, thanks to gifts to the college. Because of these advantages, it\u2019s the selective institutions that are the real bargains in the university marketplace. Holding qualifications constant, graduates of a selective university are more likely to graduate on time, will tend to find a more desirable spouse, and will earn 20 percent more than those of less selective universities\u2014every year for the rest of their working lives. These advantages swamp any differences in tuition and other expenses, which in any case are often lower than those of less selective schools because of more generous need-based financial aid. The Ivy admissions sweepstakes may be irrational, but the parents and teenagers who clamber to win it are not.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "parentCommentId": "XwcF9igJsvX9HhfKu", "user": {"username": "RyanCarey"}}, {"_id": "5B5wGHiAHxRJPwkJP", "postedAt": "2014-09-17T09:31:38.694Z", "postId": "B57HTYam9yi7p67nd", "htmlBody": "<p>&quot;In view of the fact that in any future world war nuclear weapons will certainly be employed, and that such weapons threaten the continued existence of mankind, we urge the Governments of the world to realize, and to acknowledge publicly, that their purpose cannot be furthered by a world war, and we urge them, consequently, to find peaceful means for the settlement of all matters of dispute between them.&quot; - <a href=\"http://www.umich.edu/~pugwash/Manifesto.html\">The Russel-Einstein Manifesto</a></p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "RyanCarey"}}, {"_id": "TwXs7JnJw26bg7ScA", "postedAt": "2014-09-17T09:54:25.197Z", "postId": "B57HTYam9yi7p67nd", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>We should reward the charities that we believe do the most good, not those that have the best marketing strategy, otherwise the most successful charities will be those that are best at soliciting funds, not those that are best at making the world a better place.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"http://qz.com/250845/this-week-lets-dump-a-few-ice-buckets-to-wipe-out-malaria-too/\">William MacAskill</a></p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "HelenToner"}}, {"_id": "CmWTw7eATCjtzbF57", "postedAt": "2014-09-17T10:01:38.398Z", "postId": "B57HTYam9yi7p67nd", "htmlBody": "<p>A contrasting note on the limits of instrumental rationality (which Adorno thought led to the holocaust):</p>\n<p>&quot;Bourgeois society is ruled by equivalence.

One does not tell a schoolmaster that he has expressed himself well. Hans Castorp, indeed, had done so once or twice in the early days of their acquaintance, probably from an instinct to preserve the social equilibrium; but the humanist's utterances had  never before reached quite such a didacting pitch. There was nothing for it but to pocket the admonition, feeling as embarrassed as a schoolboy at so much moralizing. Moreover, one could see by Herr Settembrini's expression that he had not finished his train of thought. He still stood so close to Hans Castorp that the young man was constrained to bend a little backwards; and his black eyes gazed fixedly into the other's face.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;You suffer, Engineer,&quot; he went on. &quot;You are like one distraught - who could help seeing it?

I have them from Lugano, where there is an office of a branch of the League. You inquire after its principles, its scope? The League for the Organization of Progress deduces from Darwinian theory the philosophic concept that man's profoundest natural impulse is in the direction of self-realization. From this it follows that all those who seek satisfaction of this impulse must become co-labourers in the cause of human progress. Many are those who have responded to the call; there is a considerable membership, in France, Italy, Spain, Turkey, and in Germany itself. I myself have the honour of having my name inscribed on the roll. A comprehensive and scientifically executed programme has been drawn up, embracing all the projects for human improvement conceivable at the moment. We are studying the problem of our health as a race, and the means for combating the degeneration which is a regrettable accompanying phenomenon of our increasing industrialization. The League envisages the founding of universities for the people, the resolution of the class conflict by means of social ameliorations which recommend themselves for the purpose, and finally the doing away with national conflicts, the abolition of war through the development of international law. You perceive that the objects toward which the League directs its efforts are ambitious and broad in their scope. Several international periodicals are evidence of its activities - monthly reviews, which contain articles in three or four languages on the subject of the progressive evolution of civilized humanity. Numerous local groups have been established in the various countries; it is expected that they will exert an edifying and enlightening influence by means of discussion evenings and appropriate Sunday observances. Above all, the League will strive its utmost to aid with the material at its disposal the political party of progress in every country. You follow me, Engineer?&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Herr Settembrini appeared satisfied. &quot;I assume that these are new and surprising ideas to you?&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Yes, I confess this is the first time I have heard of these - these endeavours.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;Ah, Settembrini murmured, &quot;ah, if you had only heard of them earlier! But perhaps it is not yet too late. These circulars - you would like to know what they say? Listen.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>[T]he League for the Organization of Progress, mindful of its task of furthering human happiness - in other words, of combating human suffering by the available social methods, to the end of finally eliminating it altogether; mindful also of the fact that this lofty task can only be accomplished by the aid of sociology, the end and aim of which is the perfect State, the League, in session at Barcelona, determined upon the publication of a series of volumes bearing the  general title <em>The Sociology of Suffering</em>. It should be the aim of the series to classify human suffering according to classes and categories, and to treat it systematically and exhaustively. You ask what is the use of classification, arrangement, systematization? I answer you: order and simplification are the first steps toward the mastery of a subject - the actual enemy is the unknown. We must lead the human race up out of the primitive stages of fear and patient stupidity, and set its feet on the path of conscious activity. We must enlighten it upon two points: first, that given effects become void when one first recognizes and then removes their causes; and second, that almost all individual suffering is due to disease of the social organism. Very well; this is the object of the <em>Sociological Pathology</em>. It will be issued in some twenty folio volumes, treating every species of human suffering, from the most personal and intimate to the great collective struggles arising from the conflicting interests of classes and nationals; it will, in short, exhibit the chemical elements whose combination in various proportions results in all the ills to which our human flesh is heir. The publication will in every case take as its norm the dignity and happiness of mankind, and seek to indicate the measures and remedies calculated to remove the cause of each deviation. Famous European specialists, physicians, psychologists, and economists will share in the composition of this encyclopedia of suffering, and the general editorial bureau at Lugano will act as the reservoir to collect all the articles which shall flow into it.&quot;</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Thomas Mann, <em>The Magic Mountain</em>, London 1924/1999, pp. 243-246.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Stefan_Schubert"}}, {"_id": "CwCs52yeMjpPdrxcq", "postedAt": "2014-09-17T12:48:56.560Z", "postId": "B57HTYam9yi7p67nd", "htmlBody": "<p>I always feel like I'm catching up too.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://aeon.co/magazine/philosophy/ross-andersen-human-extinction/\">Link to the article, for the lazy</a></p>\n", "parentCommentId": "iXxabuwBtNYkLuMzc", "user": {"username": "Evan_Gaensbauer"}}, {"_id": "kJToXvoPc4BugBcnj", "postedAt": "2014-09-17T12:55:48.720Z", "postId": "B57HTYam9yi7p67nd", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>Oskar Schindler</strong>: I could have got more out.
