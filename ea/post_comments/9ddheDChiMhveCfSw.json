For confidentiality reasons, the team can\u2019t provide details of the institutions and roles of XPT participants. However, because several of our recruitment channels were EA-adjacent or directly related to existential risks (e.g. we recruited some experts via a post on the EA Forum and reached out to some organizations working on x-risks), our prior is that the XPT biorisk experts are more concerned about catastrophic and existential risks than would, say, a sample of attendees at the <a href=\"https://www.ghsconf.com/\">Global Health Security Conference</a>. So, you\u2019re right that it shouldn\u2019t be taken as representative sample of biosecurity or biorisk experts. It is also unclear to us what that sampling frame would look like, in general.
