I think something that (understandably, as your thesis here is narrow) should be considered is how ethical theories outside of utilitarianism and deontology should be considered. Although you provided a fairly strong argument against deontology, there was no argument for <i>uniquely</i> utilitarianism as many of the intuition you had against deontology could also apply to most other ethical theories. Perhaps a virtue ethical, care ethical, or communitarian approach could accommodate for the short comings of deontology as well as (or maybe better than!) utilitarianism.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you for the post!</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Ryan F Baylon"}}, {"_id": "7YzuFywXZLotffHfx", "postedAt": "2023-07-29T20:33:29.264Z", "postId": "ZQ77uGtKX8mR4vtxo", "htmlBody": "<p>I'm not fully sure to what extent this piece means to argue for i) utilitarianism beats deontology, versus ii) utilitarianism is the correct moral theory or at least close to the correct moral theory. (At times it felt to me like the former, and at times the latter, though it's very possible that I did not read closely enough.)</p><p>To the extent that ii is the intended conclusion, I think this is overconfident on a couple of counts. Firstly, one\u2019s <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/2WS3i7eY4CdLH99eg/independent-impressions\">all-things-considered view</a> should probably take into account that only 30% of academic philosophers are consequentialists (see <a href=\"https://philarchive.org/archive/BOUPOP-3\">Bourget &amp; Chalmers, 2020, p. 8</a>; note that consequentialism is a superset of utilitarianism). Secondly, reasons relating to infinite ethics. As Joe Carlsmith (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CeeeLu9PoDzcaSfsC/on-infinite-ethics\">2022</a>) puts it:</p><blockquote><p>I think infinite ethics punctures a certain type of utilitarian dream. It\u2019s a dream I associate with the utilitarian friend quoted above (though over time he\u2019s become much more of a nihilist), and with various others. In my head (content warning: caricature), it\u2019s the dream of hitching yourself to some simple ideas \u2013 e.g., expected utility theory, totalism in population ethics, maybe&nbsp;<a href=\"https://handsandcities.com/2021/02/14/contact-with-reality/\">hedonism about well-being</a> \u2014 and riding them wherever they lead, no matter the costs. Yes, you push fat men and harvest organs; yes, you destroy Utopias for tiny chances of creating zillions of evil, slightly-happy rats (plus some torture farms on the side). But you always \u201cknow what you\u2019re getting\u201d \u2013 e.g., more expected net pleasure.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>But I think infinite ethics changes this picture. As I mentioned above: in the land of the infinite, the bullet-biting utilitarian train runs out of track. You have to get out and wander blindly. The issue isn\u2019t that you\u2019ve become fanatical about infinities: that\u2019s a bullet, like the others, that you\u2019re willing to bite. The issue is that once you\u2019ve resolved to be 100% obsessed with infinities,&nbsp;<i>you don\u2019t know how to do it</i>. Your old thing (e.g., \u201cjust sum up the pleasure vs. pain\u201d) doesn\u2019t make sense in infinite contexts, so your old trick \u2013 just biting whatever bullets your old thing says to bite \u2013 doesn\u2019t work (or it leads to&nbsp;<i>horrific&nbsp;</i>bullets, like trading&nbsp;<i>Heaven + Speck</i> for&nbsp;<i>Hell + Lollypop</i>, plus a tiny chance of the lizard). And when you start trying to craft a new version of your old thing, you run headlong into Pareto-violations, incompleteness, order-dependence, spatio-temporal sensitivities, appeals to persons as fundamental units of concern, and the rest. In this sense, you start having problems you thought you transcended \u2013 problems like the problems the other people [e.g., deontologists] had. You start having to rebuild yourself on new and jankier foundations.</p><p>\u2026</p><p>All in all, I currently think of infinite ethics as a lesson in humility: humility about how far standard ethical theory extends; humility about [...] how little we might have seen or understood.</p></blockquote>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Will Aldred"}}, {"_id": "KqYh4dWzfgLYsjgcg", "postedAt": "2023-07-29T20:45:40.403Z", "postId": "ZQ77uGtKX8mR4vtxo", "htmlBody": "<p>I respectfully disagree. Firstly, that is by no means the last word on infinite ethics (see papers by Manheim and Sandberg, and a more recent paper out of the Global Priorities Institute).

This is sensible and prudent.</p>\n<p>Thirdly, in an infinite world, we should understand that utilitarianism is not about maximising some abstract utility function or number in the sky, but about improving the conscious experiences of sentient beings. Infinities don\u2019t change the fact that I can reduce the suffering of the person in front of me, or the sentient being on the other side of the world, or the fact that this is good for them.

I\u2019m saying that we do not have an \u201cultimate argument\u201d for utilitarianism at present, and that there\u2019s a good chance that further reflection on known unknowns such as infinite ethics will reveal that our current conception of utilitarianism\u2014in so far as we\u2019re putting it forward as a \u201ccorrect moral theory\u201d candidate\u2014is non-trivially flawed.</p><blockquote><p>Secondly, we should act as if we are in a finite world [...] This is sensible and prudent.</p></blockquote><p>I disagree. I think we should act to do the most good, and this may involve, for example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://longtermrisk.org/msr\"><u>evidentially cooperating</u></a> with other civilizations across the potentially infinite universe/multiverse. Your sentence \u201cit would be seen as terribly callous of someone not to have relieved the suffering of others if it turned out we were in a finite universe all along\u201d seems to me to be claiming that we should abandon expected value calculus (or that we should set our credence on the universe/multiverse being infinite to zero, notwithstanding the possibility that we could reduce suffering by a greater amount by having and acting on a best guess credence), which I view as incorrect.</p><blockquote><p>Thirdly, [...] Infinities don\u2019t change the fact that I can reduce the suffering of the person in front of me, or the sentient being on the other side of the world</p></blockquote><p>I believe this claim falls foul of the Pareto improvement plus agent-neutrality impossibility result in infinite ethics, once you try to decide on whose suffering to reduce. (Another objection some\u2014e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/ethics/infinite.pdf\"><u>Bostrom</u></a>\u2014might make is that if there is infinite total suffering, then reducing suffering by a finite amount does nothing to reduce total suffering.
