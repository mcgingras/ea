This might be the single biggest thing I want to change about EA leaders' behavior. And relatedly, I think \"be more candid, and less nervous about PR risks\" is probably the biggest thing I want to change about rank-and-file EAs' behavior. Not because the risks are nonexistent, but because trying hard to avoid the risks via not-super-honest tactics tends to cause more harm than benefit. It's the wrong general policy and mindset.</p><blockquote><p>Q: Is your approach utilitarian? A: It's utilitarian flavoured.</p></blockquote><p>This seems like an unusually good answer to me! I'm impressed, and this updates me positively about Ben Todd's honesty and precision in answering questions like these.</p><p>I think a good description of EA is \"the approach that behaves sort of like utilitarianism, when decisions are sufficiently high-stakes and there aren't ethical injunctions in play\". I don't think utilitarianism is <i>true</i>, and it's obvious that many EAs aren't utilitarians, and obvious that utilitarianism isn't required for working on EA cause areas, or for being quantitative, systematic, and rigorous in your moral reasoning, etc. Yet it's remarkable how often our prescriptions look like the prescriptions of utilitarianism anyway.</p><p>I don't know of any better compact way of describing EA's moral perspective than \"we endorse role-playing utilitarianism (at least when the stakes are high and there aren't relevant deontology-ish prohibitions)\". And I think it's good and wholesome when EAs don't try to distance themselves from utilitarianism (given how useful it is as a way of summarizing a ton of different moral views we tend to endorse), but also don't oversimplify our relationship to utilitarianism.</p><blockquote><p>it raises questions about Will's unadvertised relationship with a controversial public figure, and one who founded a wildly successful AI Capabilities Research Lab.</p></blockquote><p>I agree that it was a terrible idea to found OpenAI, and reflects very poorly on Musk (especially given the stated reasoning at the time).</p><p>I think it's an awful idea to require every EA who's ever sent text messages to someone in Musk's reference class (or talked to him at a party, etc.) to publicly disclose the fact that they chatted. I don't see the point -- is the idea that talking to Elon Musk somehow taints you as a person?</p><p>Various MIRI staff have had conversations with Elon Musk in the past, and the idea that this fact is scandalous just sounds silly to me. I'd be more scandalized if EAs <i>didn't </i>talk to people like Musk, given the opportunity. (Or Bill Gates, or Demis Hassabis, or Barack Obama, etc.)</p><p>On some level I just think your whole framing here -- 'oh no, an EA talked to a Controversial Public Figure!' -- is misguided. \"Controversial\" is a statement about what's popular, not about what's true or good. I think that the impulse to avoid interacting in any way with people who seem Controversial <i>is the same impulse that's behind the misguided behavior the rest of your post is talking about</i>. It's the mindset of cancel culture, of guilt-by-association, of 'there's something unwholesome about talking to the Other Side at all, even to try to convince them to come around to doing the right thing'.</p><p>If we think that someone is doing the Wrong Thing, then by default we should <i>talk to them</i> and try to convince them to do things differently. EAs should primarily just be advocating for what they think is true and good, in a clear and honest voice, not playing the Six Degrees of PR Contagion game.</p><blockquote><p>Furthermore, Will's tweet here about WWOTF implied to me that he didn't know Elon personally: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/willmacaskill/status/1554378994765574144.\">https://twitter.com/willmacaskill/status/1554378994765574144.</a></p></blockquote><p>Which part implied that to you? I don't see Will lying about this, and I don't see how it matters for the thread whether Will and Elon ever send each other text messages, or whether Will tries to get Elon's buy-in on a project.</p><p>AFAIK lots of EAs have tried to get Elon to help with (or ditch!) various projects over the years, though I'm unimpressed with the results.</p><blockquote><p>I was pretty alarmed by this thread from Kerry Vaughan which touches on Ben Delo, a major EA donor prior to SBF with a fraud conviction: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KerryLVaughan/status/1591508697372663810\">https://twitter.com/KerryLVaughan/status/1591508697372663810</a>.

Someone has already addressed Ben Todd's answer on whether EA is utilitarian (saying it's utilitarian-ish is the most accurate answer, it's not deceptive), so I'll comment on the career advice you saw:</p><blockquote><p>Philosophy, but also not Philosophy?</p><p>I took a look at global priorities research. It was one of five top-recommended career paths on 80K's website and required researchers in philosophy. 80K website at time of writing:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>&gt; In general, for foundational global priorities research the best graduate subject is an economics PhD. The next most useful subject is philosophy</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This article contrasts sharply with the 80K page on philosophy:</p><p>&gt; the academic job market for philosophy is extremely challenging. Moreover, the career capital you acquire working toward a career in philosophy isn\u2019t particularly transferable. For these reasons we currently believe that, for the large majority of people who are considering it, pursuing philosophy professionally is unlikely to be the best choice.</p><p>It seems like there are significant risks to pursuing further study in philosophy that 80K are well aware of, and it does not look great that they mention them in the context of general philosophical research (that they presumably don't care about their readers pursuing) but omit them when discussing a career path they are eager for their readers to pursue. Spending 7 years getting a philosophy PhD because you want to research global priorities and then failing to find a position (the overwhelmingly likely outcome) does not sound like much fun.</p><p>This is a particularly clear example of a more general experience I've had with 80K material, namely being encouraged to make major life choices without an adequate treatment of the risks involved. I think readers deserve this information upfront.</p></blockquote><p>They aren't being dishonest here, they're answering two different questions. The first page says that the best background for global priorities research, one of their most-recommended career options, is economics followed by philosophy. The second page, on philosophy as a career path, correctly points out that the job market for philosophy is very challenging. They're not telling lots of people they should go into philosophy in the hopes that some of them will then do global priorities research. They're saying you should <i>not</i> do philosophy, but if you did, then global priorities research is a highly valuable thing your background would be suitable for, which I'd say are good recommendations all around.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "robirahman"}}, {"_id": "YpeToCWgNRdZEwmgC", "postedAt": "2022-11-16T01:00:55.217Z", "postId": "23ACb9MjQn7tizKY7", "htmlBody": "<p>Ah, I guess you're saying that the \"Crazy times!\" part sounds starstruck and &nbsp;has a vibe of \"this just occurred out of the blue\", and it would be weird to sound starstruck and astounded if Elon's someone you talk to all the time and are good friends with?</p><p>I agree that would be a bit weird, though the Will-text-messages I saw didn't cause me to think Will and Elon are <i>that</i> close, just that they've exchanged words and contact info at all.
