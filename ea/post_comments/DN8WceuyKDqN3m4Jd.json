One thrust of this talk is encouraging fellow humans to do research into considering &nbsp;expanding moral patienthood to invertebrate animals. Any suggestions and resources for going outside the presumed human baseline of moral patienthood within the animalia kingdom, or even life at all, similar to panpsychists?&nbsp;</p><p>For decades I've struggled with the seeming intractability, given current technology limitations, of minimizing harm to life in general given the need for energy to just survive, and I've long presumed that using criteria that focus on the animalia kingdom (let alone wild animals) is reflective of a deeper speciecism we would do well to eliminate, and quite likely a \"crucial consideration.\" So, eager to learn more or receive feedback.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "David J.
