Explore the possibility of hosting an EAGx conference in Africa</p></blockquote><p>I think all of these suggestions are great and I'd be very happy if they came about, especially if the agenda and talks/themes were chosen by African EAs and not prescribed by 'central' EA</p><blockquote><p>EA UCT finds itself in a competitive environment where distinguishing our focus as a research- and evidence-based movement becomes an intricate endeavour. The prevailing narrative often places an emphasis on tangible, immediate impact, which has occasionally posed hurdles in conveying the nuanced nature of EA's approach.</p></blockquote><p>It's interesting that this is the environment you find EA to be in at UCT - and I'd definitely defer to you about how EA is perceived, or what kinds of EA arguments and stories would be best received in an African context. It's interesting because I feel a lot of EA criticism in the West is that it focuses <i>too much</i> on immediate impact and not the nuanced, longer-term ones (though this may have changed in recent years)</p><blockquote><p>Central to our discourse is the aspiration for Africa to become self-reliant and cease dependency on external interventions.</p></blockquote><p>I think many EAs would agree with this - and many of the points made here seem similar to me to those made in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bsE5t6qhGC65fEpzN/growth-and-the-case-against-randomista-development\">\"Growth and the case against randomista development\"</a> and I think that argument could be strengthened when coupled with African perspectives and experiences. But also don't think these criticisms have been ignored by GHD EA, on a <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/elie-hassenfeld-givewell-critiques-and-lessons/\">recent podcast</a> the CEO of GiveWell responded to this critique, and seems to be unconvinced at the evidence base for systemic interventions and concerned that supporting them could cause harmful backfire effects (i'd recommend listening yourself rather than just accepting my summary)</p><blockquote><p>In our engagement with Effective Altruism (EA), we noted a distinct emphasis on Existential Risks, notably concerning Artificial Intelligence (AI), alongside a focus on animal welfare and veganism...It's important to note that concentrating solely on existential risks could inadvertently diminish the urgency of current issues,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/ethical-implications-of-focusing-on-extinction-risk-by-peter-singer-2021-10?barrier=accesspaylog\"><u>such as poverty and education</u></a>.</p></blockquote><p>My main 'critical' take on this post, if there is one, is that is seems to buy into the idea &nbsp;that EA used to be about Global Health and is now about 'crazy ideas'<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefce5culyr8bu\"><sup><a href=\"#fnce5culyr8bu\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;like wild animal welfare or longtermism.
