Global vaccine shortage and insufficient public health tools amidst a pandemic seems like an important, tractable cause. I\u2019d be interested in helping out if it makes sense.</p>\n<p>Personally I\u2019d be super excited about a \u201cvaccines for all\u201d type program with initial focus on increasing access to \u2014 and delivery of \u2014vaccines against pandemic agents with aims to expand globally . Does anyone know what orgs are doing that? I\u2019d also love to see an org that distributed public health tools like masks and provide materials for and potentially hosted local community sessions to assemble lower cost filtration devices like Corsi-Rosenthal boxes. With the amount of air pollution in much of the world now, this could be helpful for mitigating airborne spread of pandemic pathogens as well as harmful air pollution.</p>\n<p>Supply very well could be the main vaccine bottleneck in the UK.

Anecdotally it seems like pharmacies are too. In some places, the paucity of available vaccinators is likely contributing to lower vaccine uptake.
