One of the legacies I wanted to leave was larger than they expected. They had a maximum \u00a3 value for specific legacies, and wen I said I wanted to leave a bigger amount they cautioned me that it was likely to be overturned if legally challenged because 'nobody would expect you meant that'. I've heard similar stories from solicitors (eg a will written in the UK was overturned because the court ruled the parents would not have meant to leave the majority of their estate to the child who was better off. They did: they asked him to use the monety help the other child who was not good at handling finances, but the court reversed their legacies). One of the reasons to have a solicitor look over your will is that they challenge and confirm unusual clauses, which makes them harder to challenge when you die. </p>\n<p>All of which is to say: if you are seeking to raise funds via wills, or intended to leave a legacy that would count as unusual in normal practice, than the less formal legal input you have had the more vulnerable it will be to challenge. It cost us \u00a399 for a joint will writing package, which is a reasonable insurance policy to ensure our estates are donated as we wish. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Bernadette_Young"}}, {"_id": "LNc5Pd9anY9R78qh5", "postedAt": "2015-08-18T14:37:48.607Z", "postId": "Ybapay39nm2CtwqJv", "htmlBody": "<p>Sorry - its really clear on the website.
