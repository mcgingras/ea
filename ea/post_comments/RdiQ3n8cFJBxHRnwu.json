Here's where I currently am:</p><ul><li>I think NL pretty clearly acted poorly towards Alice and Chloe. In addition to what Ozy has in this post, the employment situation is really pretty bad. &nbsp;I don't know how this worked in the other jurisdictions, but Puerto Rico is part of the US and paying someone as an independent contractor when they were really functioning as an employee means you had an <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/flsa/misclassification\">employee that you misclassified</a>. And then $1k/mo in PR is well below minimum wage. They may be owed back pay, and consulting an employment lawyer could make sense, though since we're coming up on the two year mark it would be good to <a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/wages/backpay\">move quickly</a>.<ul><li>I think some people are sufficiently mature and sophisticated that if they and their employer choose to arrange compensation primarily in kind that's illegal more like jaywalking is illegal than like shoplifting is illegal. But I don't think Alice and Chloe fall into this category.</li><li>Many of the other issues are downstream from the low compensation. For example, if they had wanted to live separately on their own dime to have clearer live/work boundaries that would have eaten up ~all of the $1k.</li></ul></li><li>I agree with Ozy that NL's misjudgements here show a really bad fit for their chosen role in connecting and mentoring people.</li><li>While I'm overall very glad that LC put the time into collecting this information and writing it up, I think the rushed and chaotic approach to fact checking in the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims?commentId=8DGWvtFjvtDCMQmQh\">days and hours before publication</a> was <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bwtpBFQXKaGxuic6Q/effective-aspersions-how-the-nonlinear-investigation-went?commentId=zQEdnqePvK6D5DQag\">unfair to NL</a>, massively increased the noise around this, and may have been enough to make their whole efforts net-negative through a combination of worse outcomes in this case and bad precedent. &nbsp;I think in future cases fact checking without giving the accused an incentive to retaliate against sources to prevent publication is practical <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/YSHPDCRggYoXNciFZ/fact-checking-and-retaliation-against-sources\">with precommitments</a>.<ul><li>I'm frustrated with myself that in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/f77iuXmgiiFgurnBu\">Run Posts By Orgs</a> I didn't get more into the fact checking benefits, and may have led the LC team to think that the adversarial fact checking stage here was supererogatory.<ul><li>In general, I think sharing false information is fundamentally unfair to the accused, but if you draft a callout post you'll almost always have some of this: it's very difficult to get everything correct when you have only your own perspective and records. Pre-publication fact checking with the accused can mostly fix this, but someone writing about their own experience would then need to be working closely with someone that had hurt them. &nbsp;Since I think that's too much to ask, we need to be flexible in that case. But when the person writing the post doesn't have that relationship with the accused, interaction during fact checking doesn't have the same harms.</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Despite my process objections, I don't think <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/tracingwoodgrains?mention=user\">@TracingWoodgrains</a> call to <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2vNHiaTb4rcA8PgXQ/effective-aspersions-how-the-nonlinear-investigation-went\">consider this a mistrial</a> can work, and would actually be harmful. &nbsp;We need to do the best we have with the information we have, put things together, gather more information as needed, and make a coherent picture.</li></ul>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Jeff_Kaufman"}}, {"_id": "TiQhmWDwNaGh5qnxH", "postedAt": "2024-01-04T21:18:20.477Z", "postId": "RdiQ3n8cFJBxHRnwu", "htmlBody": "<p>I broadly endorse your judgment on this topic inasmuch as I've observed it, for whatever that is worth.

In response, Deck settled in what Emerson characterizes as \u201ca deal he was satisfied with that gave him significant financial freedom.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Here's the timeline as I understand it (it's been a while):<br>1. Deck builds a big social media account.</p><p>2. Emerson approaches Deck, offering to buy the brand and profit-share, under certain stipulations, including that he continue actively posting.</p><p>3. Deck no longer actively posts, essentially ending the contract terms and releasing Emerson's obligation to pay him.</p><p>To me, this seems pretty fair and standard? It doesn't seem particularly different from a brand acquisition or an influencer marketing program. Lots of founders get acquired and compensated with the stipulation that they keep performing their work under the new entity. Emerson is paying Deck to make posts in his own style. The alternative is to hire someone else to do it, and that's not ideal if you want to preserve the appeal of the original.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>But the OMGFacts brand <i>itself </i>was valuable: that\u2019s why Emerson bought it instead of starting a competing YayFacts Twitter account. Emerson probably paid more to the lawyer who negotiated the contract than he did to Deck\u2014the person who created the brand in the first place.</p></blockquote><p>Social media brands that don't post have no value.</p><p>And, in my experience managing platforms and accounts much bigger than Deck's, brands are a multiplier, but have very little value on their own. The average person follows hundreds of accounts on multiple platforms. If a Fun Facts account isn't posting for a year, no one's gonna notice, and their posts won't show up because their followers' feed will be occupied by accounts that do post regularly.</p><blockquote><p>A California law invalidates any contract with a minor that isn\u2019t overseen by a judge\u2014a crucial protection for child actors, who are often exploited by their parents. Emerson characterizes this law as a \u201cbizarre loophole,\u201d which strikes me as a very cavalier attitude towards children\u2019s labor protections.</p></blockquote><p>I mean, sorta? But of the entire influencer ecosystem, many are teenagers and very few have had their brand deals overseen by a judge. I doubt Mr Beast's first sponsor check was overseen by a judge.

The Contractor agrees not to change any passwords for any Company-related projects without the consent of the Company. Should the Contractor breach this Agreement, the Contractor will, at the Company's edict, be required to rectify the breach, including but not limited to forfeiture of revenues and a requirement to reveal to the Company the current password of the OMG Facts Twitter account<br><br>&gt; This Agreement shall commence on the \u201cEffective Date\u201d defined above and shall terminate one year thereafter, provided, however, that the Company may extend this Agreement for ten additional periods of one year each upon notice to Contractor given at least thirty days prior to the expiration initial expiration date or extended term. However, either party may terminate this contract in writing in the following instances:<br>(1) If either party is convicted of a criminal offense.<br>(2) Failure by the Contractor to meet deadlines for performance of<br>services or failing to meet the standards required by the Company in the<br>performing of services<br><br>Obviously, I am not a lawyer, but there's indeed several key clauses in there mentioning an obligation to actively perform services, which in the case of OMGFacts would essentially mean making Twitter posts. I don't think there's anything there that's particularly \"predatory\"?.<br><br>Regarding whether Deck performed this responsibility:<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqjpxxn7lsdh\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqjpxxn7lsdh\">[1]</a></sup></span><br>&gt; Here is the untold side of the story: The @OMGFacts Twitter (and Website/YouTube) is produced by us, not him. Adorian has done almost nothing for the past 15 months. &nbsp;Almost every fact you have read from OMG Facts was researched, written, and edited by us.</p><p>I will note that I couldn't find any examples of Deck disputing that he was inactive. Deck's lawyer instead argued that contracts signed by Deck himself were invalid even if co-signed by his guardians.</p><p>Again, I'm not a lawyer, but if Emerson's main argument was that Deck didn't uphold his responsibility, you'd think the easiest rebuttal would be that ... he did things as per the contract. Instead of arguing that Deck signed the contract without knowing what he was doing:<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefd56062i2e4a\"><sup><a href=\"#fnd56062i2e4a\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><blockquote><p>Deck's complaint contends that the contract he signed with Spartz was predatory and designed to dupe the teen into turning over his rights to the OMG Facts trademark without realizing what he was doing. Deck's attorney, Glenn Peterson of Roseville, argues that the intellectual property issues are moot in any case because California law allows individuals to disavow any contracts signed when they were minors.<br>Spartz counters that Deck's mother co-signed the contract as his legal guardian, and that Deck is simply hoping to exploit Spartz Inc.'s hard work for a quick gain.</p></blockquote><p>So even just using public sources, we can establish that there were multiple clauses referencing an obligation to actively post, that Emerson claims Deck did not fulfil this, and Deck never even attempts to deny this, instead trying to invalidate the contract altogether. I don't see a particularly strong reason to <i>\"side with Deck\"</i> on this one, unless there's any claims/evidence that he did perform his responsibility that he hasn't publicly disclosed for 15 years.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnqjpxxn7lsdh\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefqjpxxn7lsdh\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110513103830/https://emersonspartz.tumblr.com/post/5150292566\">Emerson Spartz, OMG Fact: There are two sides to every story.

If there were a contractual obligation to produce content on an ongoing basis, I'd expect the contract to specify how much content, for how long. I'd understand 'internet related services' to mean help with access to the account, authentication, etc. as relevant, not as an ongoing job as a content creator.&nbsp;<br><br>I agree that Emerson argues that Emerson alone created content for the site, and that Deck doesn't dispute this, but neither of them seem to actually argue Deck had a contractual obligation to create such content (and reading the contract, I think he clearly did not). Instead, I parse Emerson making this claim as a sort of moral claim to the high ground (\"I'm the one doing the hard work here\"), not a claim that Deck failed to fulfill contractual responsibilities. I don't see anywhere where Emerson actually alleges breach of terms by Deck, as opposed to alleging that Deck is trying to take advantage of Emerson's hard work by backing out of the contract.</p>", "parentCommentId": "L7jzBAAoqHDykAQWG", "user": {"username": "Kelsey Piper"}}, {"_id": "z8a9cdGGEQ6CRCBrZ", "postedAt": "2024-01-12T03:17:17.222Z", "postId": "RdiQ3n8cFJBxHRnwu", "htmlBody": "<p>Again, not a lawyer so I'm willing to accept I'm wrong.<br><br>I think this very much depends on how \"services requested by the company\" is interpreted.</p><blockquote><p>\"render internet related services as requested by the Company from time to time</p><p>Failure by the Contractor to meet deadlines for performance of<br>services or failing to meet the standards required by the Company in the<br>performing of services</p></blockquote><p>You could argue that access is what's requested, yes. Personally, I don't, because access by default is already assumed under a later clause that uses a different wording: <i>\"The Contractor agrees not to change any passwords for any Company-related projects without the consent of the Company\"</i></p><p>Or you could argue that if Emerson reasonably demands active posting, he is entitled to it under the terms of the contract, and entitled to terminate the contract if this is not fulfilled. We could argue over what constitutes reasonable demands, but I would think it's more than <i>\"almost nothing\".</i></p><p>Not specifying the <i>exact</i> timings didn't stand out to me. In my experience, it's not very common to specify <i>exact</i> posting schedules for a long-term brand partnership with a teenager.
