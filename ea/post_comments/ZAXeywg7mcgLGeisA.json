However, using diarrhea cases as a proxy for morbidity and mortality was the best we could come up with. We welcome any additional suggestions.</li><li>In addition, from what we saw from the individual studies considered in the systematic reviews we took into account, none seem to be powered to detect effects on mortality, and most do not report it as an outcome. To make sure reductions in diarrhea cases translate into mortality reductions, one would probably need to do what Kremer and his colleagues did for their 2015 systematic review - individually reach the authors of each study and ask whether they collected any mortality data that went undisclosed due to low statistical power.

When applying the 2.35 Mills Reincke multiplier in our cost-effectiveness analysis, we were more concerned with comparing different water quality interventions than getting the exact number for a CEA (dollars per DALY).

Both the mean and the median effect sizes on the population-wide all-cause mortality were -19%, ranging from +0.9 to -58%. Surprisingly, this is an even larger effect size than the one observed when considering under-5 mortality alone (median: -11%; mean: -10 to -13%).

However, the report's authors argue that it may still be true for older children and adolescents:</li></ul><blockquote><p>[...] However, we do not have much evidence on whether it operates in people over 5.

This mechanism is expected to affect young children the most since they have smaller body reserves of energy, protein, and other nutrients.<br>We identified one study that addresses this hypothesis empirically in under-5s and over-5s side-by-side. Newman et al. 2020 measured the risk of respiratory infection following a bout of diarrhea in infants and mothers. Infants had a substantially elevated risk of respiratory infection following diarrhea, while mothers did not. This provides some evidence that the Mills-Reincke phenomenon may not operate in adults. It is worth noting that the \u201cover 5\u201d category we use in this CEA is not composed solely of adults, and children over 5 may still be susceptible to the Mills-Reincke phenomenon. To derive this adjustment, we assume that Mills-Reincke has an impact half as large in over-5s as in under-5s. This is a very uncertain guess. We also assume that water quality interventions avert 2.7 non-enteric deaths for each enteric death averted (see water quality report for calculation, link below), and that the 50% downward adjustment only applies to non-enteric deaths.</p></blockquote><p>In any case, we added a sensitivity analysis to our <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Se_gaDm8-kkCi459vuBK4a0RyfDuZ853mtrHvkwStNI/edit#gid=1561319653&amp;range=CH:CJ\">Effectiveness Supplement</a> where we consider no Mills-Reincke effect for age groups over 5 y.o.

If so, the presence of findings suggestive of MSD [moderate-to-severe diarrhea] was solicited (sunken eyes, wrinkled skin, hospitalization, receipt of intravenous hydration, or dysentery), and source(s) of healthcare were recorded. These data were used to adjust the size of the DSS population at each site as necessary to contribute the requisite number of cases of MSD to each age stratum, and to select 1 or more \u201csentinel\u201d health centers (SHCs) serving the DSS population at each site (Table 1) as venues for the case/control study based on their potential to capture MSD cases from the DSS.</p></blockquote><p>It turns out that the resulting data from the HUAS study is easily accessible <a href=\"https://clinepidb.org/ce/app/workspace/analyses/DS_221d2bcac4/new\">for anyone to consult</a>.

This is a slightly enhanced version of our model and represents an interesting proposition on how to extrapolate the effect of the intervention from cases to mortality - given more time, it could even be expanded to consider pathogen-specific case-fatality rates, which should be even better.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnote-section footnotes\" data-footnote-section=\"\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"xfq0zutw9s\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnxfq0zutw9s\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"xfq0zutw9s\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefxfq0zutw9s\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>We, the authors of the originial report, had only very limited participation in the changes made between the two versions.&nbsp;</p></div></li></ol>", "parentCommentId": "bqL9BHtfAh5oECfi8", "user": {"username": "bcbernardo"}}]
