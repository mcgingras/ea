I may have misunderstood you, but your example seems not to take into account the overhead of managing a larger team, or the diminishing returns of each additional staff member. This goes to the heart of my question: what would be the most effective way for each individual to further EA causes? Should they work full time and donate more, or work part time and do other things (this question may only apply to those who are earning to give). \nThis question can best be determined on a case by case basis of course. It relates to the current article, because I was wondering if anyone tried to analyze the potential returns of localized outreach. I can compare such an analysis to the estimates I have of my startup's risks and rewards. These are numbers I prefer not to mention, mainly because they are highly speculative.  </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "W8xKDjbxTAWMgeYcJ", "user": {"username": "UriKatz"}}, {"_id": "XBmxsca3wQBECv5s7", "postedAt": "2014-10-29T08:55:23.456Z", "postId": "XvHrFnSbT37GFLYme", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>Do you know of any work that has been done comparing the effectiveness of outreach to other activities effective altruism supporters can take?

My assumption is that members of such a group recognize their need for harmonious interconnection. Think of a living organism in which all organs work in unity and harmony. A more or less normal organism does not have what you call \u201cmanagement overhead\u201d. Complexity of physical human body, with all its \u201cmajor and minor\u201d organs, comprised of hundreds of millions of cells,  is much greater than complexity of a small (3 to10 person) team. \nIf you are interested and free in principle of forming a small project team for sustainable propagation, I\u2019d like to chat with you in skype.  </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "6sbGf75DdmQccozFs", "user": {"username": "Ilya"}}, {"_id": "s9nNpESRCKTiJH5Po", "postedAt": "2014-10-30T18:31:14.417Z", "postId": "XvHrFnSbT37GFLYme", "htmlBody": "<p>Vincent, thank you referencing The High Impact Network, which stimulated my further comment to Uri, and an opportunity to meet Brooklyn members of THINK.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "XBmxsca3wQBECv5s7", "user": {"username": "Ilya"}}, {"_id": "sRr2G4syR7vCheCZX", "postedAt": "2014-10-31T06:30:23.965Z", "postId": "XvHrFnSbT37GFLYme", "htmlBody": "<p>I'm pleased to hear that!</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "s9nNpESRCKTiJH5Po", "user": {"username": "Vincent_deB"}}, {"_id": "w7vre74whBF3yvv8n", "postedAt": "2014-11-01T20:42:35.156Z", "postId": "XvHrFnSbT37GFLYme", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you for your offer to help me further, but having reviewed the link posted by Vincent, I am certain I do not have the time to start a local chapter right now.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "R5fmAM7S438dgrfBR", "user": {"username": "UriKatz"}}, {"_id": "5AQurLtSKdZKGfyNJ", "postedAt": "2014-11-08T13:06:41.255Z", "postId": "XvHrFnSbT37GFLYme", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Uri, Unfortunately I don't know the answer to your question. As you suggest the answer might vary from person to person or situation to situation and be skewed by effects with small probabilities but huge impacts.</p>\n<p>The only thing that I would say however is to disagree with your comment that &quot;work on an outreach program ..[will] require significant time and effort&quot;.</p>\n<p>It requires as much or as little time and effort as you are willing to put in.</p>\n<p>For example just creating a Facebook group in London and creating a social event every month has helped grow the movement in London.
