As a volunteer and (briefly) contractor at OFTW, I always found him to be extremely thoughtful, transparent, and committed to the success and impact of the org. I think he's unusually good at, and committed to, seeking out and receiving critical feedback, more so than anyone I've met in other workplaces. On a more personal level I felt like he was interested in my wellbeing and development even as someone playing a very very minor role in the orgs work, and good fun to hang out with in the pub.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Joe Pusey"}}, {"_id": "LBHrGWem8NRynwG3p", "postedAt": "2024-02-14T09:17:37.535Z", "postId": "SCxHg9YszEDKkMzyz", "htmlBody": "<p>Seconded all of the above.
