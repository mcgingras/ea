I think &nbsp;I agree with the point you're making, but not the language it's expressed in? I notice that your suggestion is a change in endorsed moral principles, but you make an instrumental argument, not a moral one.

The idea of ethical injunctions is extremely important, but not currently treated a central EA pillar idea. I would be very wary of EA self-modifying into a movement that explicitly rejects utilitarianism <i>on the grounds that this will lead to better utilitarian outcomes</i>.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "james.lucassen"}}]
