It\u2019s not for researchers at places like OpenPhil to decide what should be the next welfare ask. It\u2019s for donors, volunteers, researchers who want to mention your conclusions in passing, and even retailers considering whether to sign the Better Chicken Commitment. I don\u2019t know if animal charities would do it, but such a sentence could even be included in petitions urging retailers and restaurants to implement welfare reforms. Yes, it would be more accurate to write that according to your research, \u201cbroiler reforms increase annoying pain by 4.5% but decrease hurtful pain by\u2026.\u201d But that is clunky and then the reader might be confused about whether the welfare reform are even good because there is more annoying pain. So it\u2019s more difficult to make a point that these reforms are very impactful using your research. Hence, your great work is cited less and has less impact than it could have. And yes, you can\u2019t accurately say whether the reform decreases suffering by 30% or 60% because it might depend on what weights for different categories of pain you will use. But I think that many people assume that it\u2019s more like 5% so whatever you write on the subject, I think it would be useful.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, if you don\u2019t do it well, someone else will do it poorly.

Yes, I see it can be frustrating to have estimates disaggregated (it is very much for us too), and that it can reduce the use and impact of the work. At this moment though we feel it is important to have a solid evidence-based model to quantify animal suffering. That is, a model that is very robust to scrutiny by academics (so they are more likely to adopt it) and by the industry, one in which all estimates can be justified thoroughly.Traction in the academic community is important because as a small team, we would be unable to analyse all situations of animal suffering (in farming context, research, etc) by ourselves, so ideally academics should adopt it too to enable increasing the coverage of the analyses substantially. Robustness against criticisms by the industry is also important to ensure the credibility of this new type of evidence, as used by advocates, in this early stage. &nbsp;So while we can justify well time in four intensities of suffering, knowledge is not yet available for us to do the same regarding equivalence weights. That said, we have been using summaries of the estimates like \"there is a decrease of about 60% of the time in pain for every hen raised in an aviary instead of a cage\".

The main issues I'd like to raise are:</p><p>1. Whether aversiveness varies linearly or super-linearly with pain intensity can only be determined if the pain intensity is represented on a ratio scale (e.g. with the same intensity difference between 0-1 and 9-10). In several studies, however, the ratio scale consists of values arbitrarily assigned to verbal descriptions of pain intensity (e.g. source [22]: \"2: just noticeable, 3: weak, 4: mild, 5: moderate, 6: strong, 7: severe, 8: excruciating\"). If the participants react mainly to the verbal descriptions (and less to the assigned numbers), which seems plausible to me, then we can't draw any conclusions from the mathematical relationship between the (arbitrary) numbers and the aversiveness. Another interpretation could be that the assumed difference in pain intensity between \"just noticeable\" and \"weak\" is simply much smaller than the assumed difference in pain intensity between \"severe\" and \"excruciating\", even though the assigned values differ by 1 in both cases. The same concern applies to [19], [20], but not to [21].</p><p>2. Even when pain intensity is represented only by numbers (and not by verbal descriptions), it's not obvious how participants interpolate between the highest and lowest numbers. Take [21]: In the appendix it says, \u201cpain intensity is rated using a pain scale 0\u201310, with 0=no pain and 10=worst pain imaginable\u201d. Do participants treat these numbers as if they were on a ratio scale (e.g. with the same intensity difference between 0-1 and 9-10)? It's not unreasonable to think so, but we just don't know because they're not asked to do so. It may well be that they are interpolating on a log scale, where intensities are compressed the higher they go (or something else entirely). For example, if pain intensities are interpreted logarithmically, the identical plot for aversiveness would imply that aversiveness varies *linearly* with intensity, not super-linearly.</p><p>3. \u201cResearch in this area indicates that as sensations, including pain, increase in intensity, their perceived aversiveness grows exponentially [24]\u201d. The source [24], however, only seems to show that as *physical stimuli* (such as loudness or visual flash rate) increase in intensity, their perceived aversiveness grows super-linearly. This doesn't say anything about the relationship between *pain intensity* (or other sensations) and perceived aversiveness. An alternative explanation might be that pain intensity varies super-linearly with physical stimuli, and perceived aversiveness varies *linearly* with pain intensity. Also, according to [24], perceived aversiveness doesn\u2019t vary \u201cexponentially\u201d, as you claim, but according to a \u201cpower function\u201d which means e.g. y=x^2, not y=2^x. I haven\u2019t checked the other psychophysics sources cited, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if they suffered from the same limited explanatory power.</p><p>4. It seems hard even in theory for participants to distinguish between pain intensity and pain aversiveness. I\u2019m somewhat convinced by behavioral studies (such as [21]) that express aversiveness in terms of trade-offs (a measurement distinct from pain intensity), but less so by the other study designs.</p><p>5. Some of the sources are very old ([24] from 1957, [25] from 1959), which in and of itself doesn\u2019t invalidate the claims, but still surprised me a little. Do they still represent the current state of science?</p><p>I'd be interested to hear your reaction to these points. I'm sure there are things I'm missing or that I\u2019m getting wrong.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "nalthaus"}}, {"_id": "sQJxk4wYFLtbf2djx", "postedAt": "2024-03-05T15:25:33.206Z", "postId": "C2qiY9hwH3Xuirce3", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you for the detailed comments, it is really nice to see you were so thorough with the text and the studies we cite, these are good points!</p><p>If we understand you well, with a few exceptions (as in the case of the time trade-off study, [21]), what you mention is that the superlinearity observed could be a by-product of participants of the studies interpreting the designed scales of intensity (even the numerical ones) as not equidistant, hence a non-equidistant plot of aversiveness could, for example, be observed if the relationship between intensity and aversiveness was in fact linear.</p><p><br>My impression, however, is that we are referring to different things when we say pain intensity (and this is our fault for not being clearer on the text, we will make the distinction clearer). My understanding is that \u2018pain intensity\u2019 is often used simply as a synonym for aversiveness or unpleasantness, as opposed to physical intensity of stimuli/pain signals.&nbsp;</p><p><br>As I see it, assessments of pain intensity (unpleasantness) are typically made on what can only be understood as an ordinal scale. Whether evidence on pain unpleasantness is collected with verbal descriptors or numerical descriptors, these unpleasantness scales (i.e. the intensity scales used) can only be interpreted as ordinal exactly because we do not know what type of understanding of the scale study participants have. Even though some authors use the data collected (e.g., pain intensity/unpleasantness ratings in scales from 1-10 or 1-100) and calculate things such as areas under the curve for plots of \u2018intensity\u2019 (meant as unpleasantness) ratings x duration, the data is still ordinal for practical purposes and unsuitable for these operations.&nbsp;</p><p><br>So the effort in this work was to try and see if it would be possible to make such a conversion of pain unpleasantness (from ordinal to ratio scale), and determine the distance among the categories of unpleasantness on a ratio scale. Thus, in the case of the psychophysics studies, I do not see three parameters: intensity of physical stimuli, pain intensity and pain aversiveness, but only two: intensity of physical stimuli and aversiveness (we will correct the text where we mention that the relationship is exponential).</p><p><br>On the availability of studies, unfortunately, all of them were riddled with limitations. Although designs such as the time trade-off approach (used in study [21]) are much better, to our surprise the literature is extremely scarce.

I think it\u2019s good to make those distinctions clearer (as you suggested).
