I now think that perhaps (I am still not 100% convinced as the data on confirmed cases on flights seems scarce) flights, especially if they are on average in fact \"silent\", are substantially less risky than visiting a crowded, loud and poorly ventilated bar. Before you had the patience to walk me through the evidence, I had perhaps erroneously believed that taking a flight was on par with such an activity.</p><p>(one more reason for my suggestion is that I very often get sick when travelling by air no matter how much hand sanitizer I use.

My focus had not been masks because, insofar as they would make EAG safer in a cost-beneficial way, I don't think increasing mask adoption at EAG would have strong follow-on effects on other actors/the personal protective equipment (PPE) field in general. On the other hand, interventions to clean the air directly (ventilation, filtration, and UV light) seem to require better piloting on the critical path to wide adoption. Since a world with clean indoor air has both near-term health and long-term existential safety benefits my hypothesis is that piloting them in EA spaces is uniquely attractive compared to masks.</p><p>I know a lot of EAG biosecurity groups are excited about next-gen PPE and insofar as prototypes become available where EAG could serve as a useful testing ground, I'd become much more excited about implementing PPE there.</p><p>That said, I acknowledge your arguments that the direct benefits to EA health may justify masking. I personally do tend towards the \"I dislike wearing masks; I think they impose real burdens that likely outweigh the health benefits for EAs\" side of things, but I don't feel like my view on that is particularly well-justified.</p>", "parentCommentId": "xFkc37RHsTopcrETP", "user": {"username": "joshcmorrison"}}, {"_id": "r3EaXxCf2e3M863RZ", "postedAt": "2022-09-22T14:28:54.348Z", "postId": "YNcjDoH6DaHzfhWGb", "htmlBody": "<p>Air quality is in a funny place where 1. directionally, it is clear that removing pathogens from the air is definitely helpful in reducing infection (also removing other pollutants is useful as well) but 2. the level of benefit requires further research to quantify (i.e. if you remove 99% of pathogens from the air every hour, we don't know what % effect that will have on transmission).

That\u2019s just one pick from almost a thousand people. Her bubble may be unusually Covidious due to being a bubble with Covid though. So I don\u2019t think Microcovid overestimates the risk of infection.</p><p>I\u2019ve so far used the individual\u2019s risk of infection and multiplied it with the number of individuals. But of course these people infect each other, so they are very much not independent. I would imagine that an EAG has either very few or very many infections. So that would require tracking the number over the course of several events to be able to average over them.</p><p>But a relatively Covid-conscious event like the Less Wrong Community Weekend may also cause or be correlated with more people afterwards reporting their Covid infections. A more Covid-oblivious EAG probably suffers underreporting afterwards. Maybe 10x from the same source that causes people not to fill in feedback surveys unless they are strongly coerced to and maybe another 10x from bad tests and bad sample-taking.</p><p>Some people don\u2019t have the routine figured out of rubbing the swap first against the tonsils and then sticking it through the nose all the way down into the throat. Plus there are order-of-magnitude differences in the sensitivity of the self-tests. Bad tests and bad sample-taking can easily make a difference of 10x among the people who think they just had a random cold. So maybe a follow-up survey should ask about symptoms rather than confirmed positive tests, be embedded in various other feedback questions (so that it\u2019s not just filled in by people with Covid), and then be used as a sample to extrapolate to the whole attendee population.</p><p>I\u2019ve been trying to find studies on medical conferences but the only one I could find had various safety mechanisms in place, very much unlike EAGx, so it\u2019s unsurprising that very few people got Covid.
