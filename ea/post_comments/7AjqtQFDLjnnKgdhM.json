It would be cool to see some math of the utility/importance of this (you may know Guesstimate is a great tool for this :D), and I echo the desire to see tractable steps and an analysis of what effects the intervention(s) could have. I'm also curious where you think most of the disutility from electronic ballots comes from: <em>the candidate that is elected</em> or <em>the perception that the election was hacked</em>? If the former, I'd guess that many people here including me flag an intuitive penalty on cause areas/interventions that involve partisan politics due to its zero-sum, <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/09/22/beware-systemic-change/\">man vs. man</a>, <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/gw/politics_is_the_mindkiller/\">mindkilling</a> nature.
