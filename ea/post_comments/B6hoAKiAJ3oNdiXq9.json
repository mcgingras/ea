They request funding for specific projects to expand their research and implementation efforts.</p><p><strong>Key points</strong>:</p><ol><li>Research is focused on modeling responses to nuclear winter crop loss, infrastructure collapse scenarios, and combination catastrophes. Funding sought for infrastructure resilience and target region planning.</li><li>Policy work involves translating research into national preparedness plans. Funding would expand engagements in the US, Australia, Argentina and other regions.</li><li>Technology involves developing open source solutions to food production bottlenecks. Funding sought for extruders, rope twisters, small scale plants.</li><li>Overall goal is to increase global resilience against catastrophic crop loss from nuclear war, pandemic infrastructure collapse, or other global shocks.</li><li>Funding needs estimated at $300k-$500k for research, $10k-$100k for policy, and $160k-$250k for technology pilots.</li><li>Volunteers also sought, including for ALLFED's board.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>This comment was auto-generated by the EA Forum Team.
