Assuming 1 attack per year (extrapolated on the current rate of bio-attacks) and assuming that only 10% [seems pessimistic to me] of such attacks that kill more than 5 billion eventually lead to extinction (due to the breakdown of society, or other knock-on effects), we get an annual existential risk of 0.0000014 (or 1.4\u2009\u00d7\u200910<sup>\u20136</sup>).</p></blockquote>", "parentCommentId": "Q5iiHbY85xSpwyHio", "user": {"username": "vascoamaralgrilo"}}]
