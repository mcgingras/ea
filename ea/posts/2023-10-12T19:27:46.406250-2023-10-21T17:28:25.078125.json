MATS provides scholars with housing in Berkeley, CA, as well as travel support, a co-working space, and a community of peers. The main goal of MATS is to help scholars develop as AI safety researchers. You can read more about our theory of change <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8vLvpxzpc6ntfBWNo/seri-ml-alignment-theory-scholars-program-2022#Theory_of_change\">here</a>.</p><p>Based on individual circumstances, we may be willing to alter the time commitment of the program and arrange for scholars to leave or start early. Please tell us your availability when applying. Our tentative timeline for the MATS Winter 2023-24 program is below.</p><p>Scholars will receive a USD 12k stipend from <a href=\"https://www.aisafetysupport.org/\">AI Safety Support</a> for completing the Training and Research Phases.</p><h2>Applications (Now!)</h2><p><strong>Applications open</strong>: October 20</p><p><strong>Applications are due</strong>: November 17</p><p><i>Note: Neel Nanda's applicants will follow a modified schedule; see section below.</i></p><h2>Training Phase (January 8 - January 21)</h2><p>Accepted applicants are generally expected to have completed <a href=\"https://course.aisafetyfundamentals.com/alignment\">AI Safety Fundamentals' Alignment Course</a> or similar prior to the start of the MATS program/</p><p>MATS begins with a two-week Training Phase. To equip scholars with a broad understanding of the AI safety field, the Training Phase features an advanced AI safety research curriculum, mentor-specific reading lists, discussion groups, and more.</p><h2>Research Phase (January 22-March 15)</h2><p>The core of MATS is a two-month Research Phase. During this Phase, each scholar spends at least one hour a week working with their mentor, with more frequent communication via Slack. Mentors vary considerably in terms of their:</p><ul><li>Influence on project choices</li><li>Attention to low-level details vs high-level strategies</li><li>Emphasis on outputs vs processes</li><li>Availability for meetings</li></ul><p>Our Scholar Support team complements mentors by offering dedicated 1-1 check-ins, research coaching, debugging, and general executive help to unblock research progress and accelerate researcher development.</p><p>Educational seminars and workshops will be held 2-3 times per week. We also organize multiple networking events to acquaint scholars with researchers in the Berkeley AI safety community.</p><h3>Research Milestones</h3><p>Scholars complete two milestones during the Research Phase. The first is a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fQwy2btcWn3XRQkgu45kKnPPHMVQs28QHpaNtDCfXQY/edit#heading=h.ozvm8udh0z0y\">Scholar Research Plan</a> outlining a threat model or risk factor, a theory of change, and a plan for their research. This document will guide their work during the remainder of the program, which culminates in a research symposium attended by members of the Berkeley AI safety community. The second milestone is a ten-minute <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SB_vl6pGuSO7qidkZ8fIKPeH7fZIC8mvXzxicFjGyrE/edit#heading=h.ozvm8udh0z0y\">research presentation</a> at this event.</p><h3>Community at MATS</h3><p>The Research Phase provides scholars with a community of peers, who share an office, meals, and housing. In contrast to pursuing independent research remotely, working in a community grants scholars easy access to future collaborators, a deeper understanding of other research agendas, and a social network in the AI safety community. Scholars also receive support from a full-time Community Manager.</p><p>During our Summer Cohort, each week of the Research Phase included at least one social event, such as a party, game night, movie night, or hike. Weekly lightning talks provided scholars with an opportunity to share their research interests in an informal, low-stakes setting. Outside of work, scholars organized social activities, including road trips to Yosemite, visits to San Francisco, pub outings, weekend meals, and even a skydiving trip.</p><h2>Extension Phase (April 1-July 26)</h2><p>At the conclusion of the Research Phase, scholars can apply to continue their research in a four-month Extension Phase cohort, in London by default. Acceptance decisions are largely based on receiving mentor endorsements and securing external funding. By this Phase, we expect scholars to pursue their research with high autonomy.</p><h2>Post-MATS</h2><p>After completion of the program, MATS alumni have:</p><ul><li>Been hired by leading organizations like <a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/\">Anthropic</a>, <a href=\"https://openai.com/\">OpenAI</a>, <a href=\"https://intelligence.org/\">MIRI</a>, <a href=\"https://www.alignment.org/\">ARC</a>, <a href=\"https://www.conjecture.dev/\">Conjecture</a>, and the US government, and joined academic research groups like <a href=\"https://humancompatible.ai/\">UC Berkeley CHAI</a>, <a href=\"https://wp.nyu.edu/arg/\">NYU ARG</a>, and <a href=\"https://space.mit.edu/home/tegmark/technical.html\">MIT Tegmark Group</a>;</li><li>Founded AI safety organizations, including <a href=\"https://www.arena.education/\">ARENA</a>, <a href=\"https://www.apolloresearch.ai/\">Apollo Research</a>, <a href=\"https://www.leap-labs.com/\">Leap Labs</a>, <a href=\"https://timaeus.co/\">Timaeus</a>, <a href=\"https://cadenzalabs.org/\">Cadenza Labs</a>, <a href=\"https://www.aipolicy.us/\">Center for AI Policy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.catalyze-impact.org/\">Catalyze Impact</a>, and <a href=\"https://stakeout.ai/\">Stake Out AI</a>;</li><li>Pursued&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/P3Yt66Wh5g7SbkKuT/how-to-get-into-independent-research-on-alignment-agency\">independent research</a>&nbsp;with funding from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future\">Long-Term Future Fund</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/how-to-apply-for-funding/\">Open Philanthropy</a>, or <a href=\"https://manifund.org/\">Manifund</a>.</li></ul><p>You can read more about MATS alumni&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.matsprogram.org/alumni\">here</a>.</p><h2>Information Specific to Neel Nanda</h2><h3>Applications</h3><p><strong>Applications are due</strong>: November 10</p><p><strong>Acceptance decisions</strong>: November 17</p><h3>Training Phase (November 20 - December 22)</h3><p>Neel Nanda's scholars will complete a remote Training Phase, consisting of two weeks learning about mech interp and two weeks performing a Research Sprint in a pair\u2014see the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18qYhY6FB0AiVP9cNr9idP5YYkN_654WNVgfyL9LgfHA/edit\">overview doc</a> from the last program for more information.</p><p>Significantly more offers will be made for this initial Training Phase than for the subsequent Research Phase (last time, 19 scholars completed this Phase, and nine continued to the Research Phase), but past scholars who did not progress still found this Phase a good introduction to mech interp research. Offers to continue will be based largely on performance in the Research Sprint.</p><p>Neel's scholars will receive a stipend of USD 4800 from <a href=\"https://www.aisafetysupport.org/\">AI Safety Support</a> for participation in the Training Phase.</p><h3>Research Phase (January 8 - March 15)</h3><p>Those who continue to the Research Phase will begin in-person in Berkeley on January 8 with the other scholars. For Neel's scholars, this will be considered the start of the Research Phase.</p><h1>Who Should Apply?</h1><p>Our ideal applicant has:</p><ul><li>An understanding of the AI safety research landscape equivalent to having completed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://course.aisafetyfundamentals.com/alignment\">AI Safety Fundamentals' Alignment Course</a> (if you are accepted into the program but have not previously completed this course, you are expected to do so before the Training Phase begins);</li><li>Previous experience with technical research (e.g. ML, CS, math, physics, neuroscience, etc.), generally at a postgraduate level; and</li><li>Strong motivation to pursue a career in&nbsp;AI safety&nbsp;research.</li></ul><p>Even if you do not meet all of these criteria,&nbsp;<strong>we encourage you to&nbsp;apply</strong>!

I hope to explain my intuition, and provide enough historical evidence to make this intuition at least plausible.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Introduction: An Intuition Pump</h3><p>Suppose you told someone in 1978 that no new nuclear power plants would be built in the US until 2023.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffm4acxczgut\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfm4acxczgut\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This would probably be very surprising. Nuclear power was supposed to be the power of the future.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzt531jat6lc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzt531jat6lc\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The Nuclear Regulatory Commission had only been created 3 years earlier.</p><p>Given this information, someone in 1978 might predict that something terrible was about to happen. Maybe a nuclear war between the USA and USSR that destroys America\u2019s industrial capacity. Maybe economic collapse due to overpopulation or global warming. Maybe an Orwellian police state in time for&nbsp;<i>1984</i>, or a World Authority designed to regulate nuclear weapons that got out of hand.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref67oyvdte327\"><sup><a href=\"#fn67oyvdte327\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p>None of this happened. Instead, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission increased the regulatory ratchet<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzgeoj9ygpio\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzgeoj9ygpio\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;until building new nuclear power plants became uneconomical. These regulations only applied to the USA, but they seem to have significantly impacted nuclear power research globally. Countries that are building new nuclear power plants are still using designs that were developed before 1970.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftnzjieddvlg\"><sup><a href=\"#fntnzjieddvlg\">[5]</a></sup></span></p><p>Regulation on nuclear power probably did slow US economic growth over the next 45 years compared to the counterfactual.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefb1mwzypb12v\"><sup><a href=\"#fnb1mwzypb12v\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;But the past 45 years have hardly been catastrophic. Economic growth and innovation did continue, driven by other industries.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Consequences of Stopping AGI?</h3><p>Some people involved in the debate about slowing or pausing AI seem to think that successfully stopping AI progress over the long term would likely lead to death or dystopia:</p><blockquote><p>Either we figure out how to make AGI go well or we wait for the asteroid to hit.</p><p>&nbsp;- Sam Altman<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefykwc2hmm36\"><sup><a href=\"#fnykwc2hmm36\">[7]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>If we don\u2019t get AI, I think there\u2019s a 50%+ chance in the next 100 years we end up dead or careening towards Venezuela.</p><p>&nbsp;- Scott Alexander<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdy12cxb0q8o\"><sup><a href=\"#fndy12cxb0q8o\">[8]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>I think we should be quite worried that the global government needed to enforce such a ban would greatly increase the risk of permanent tyranny, itself an existential catastrophe.</p><p>&nbsp;- Nora Belrose<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbir1a34frvv\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbir1a34frvv\">[9]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>It seems likely that we would need to create a worldwide police state, as otherwise [an indefinite AI pause] would fail in the long run.</p><p>&nbsp;- Matthew Barnett<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdm2wyk2xqk\"><sup><a href=\"#fndm2wyk2xqk\">[10]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>It feels to me like this is the same sort of mistake that our hypothetical person from 1978 made. It might seem like AI will be an extremely important thing in the future, and so something dramatic would have to happen in order to prevent it. I think that we should put more probability on the boring future where regulation stifles this one field, while the rest of society continues as it had before.</p><p>This seems like an important disagreement. If you think that our descendants\u2019 lives will be pretty good, and getting better if not unimaginably quickly, then stopping AI progress might be worth it for them. If you think that our descendants\u2019 future will be \u201cshort and grim,\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdy12cxb0q8o\"><sup><a href=\"#fndy12cxb0q8o\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;then they might be less of a consideration when deciding whether to take this risk now.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Specific Concerns</h3><p>Scott Alexander mentions several specific concerns that cause him to be pessimistic about a future without AI progress. Each of them seems like a real problem that people now and in the future should be trying to solve. We should be improving biosecurity,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1a3neodgqcg\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1a3neodgqcg\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;promoting economic growth,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3i45lkl75tc\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3i45lkl75tc\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;spreading democracy &amp; freedom,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefg1jciz8vwai\"><sup><a href=\"#fng1jciz8vwai\">[13]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and giving people hope in future generations. But none of these things seem even close to a 50% chance of causing death or dystopia in the next 100 years. It would not be worth accepting existential risk from AI, which Scott Alexander estimates as having a ~20% chance of causing human extinction, to avoid these.&nbsp;</p><p>Both Nora Belrose and Matthew Barnett are concerned that a global police state would be needed to enforce a long term ban on AI progress. This position does not seem uncommon in the AI safety community. The concerns are that research might shift to locations with fewer regulations, and that algorithmic progress will make AGI possible on a personal computer. The only way to avoid AGI then is a massive expansion of global government power.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Other Historical Examples</h3><p>I do not think that these concerns have been realized with other technologies.&nbsp;</p><p>Regulations in one industry do not stop progress in all other industries. People in the Bay Area likely underestimate the importance of emerging technologies other than AI, or software more generally, because information technology is disproportionately important in the local economy.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflzsu31lrq2j\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlzsu31lrq2j\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I would similarly expect that people living in Detroit in 1950 would underestimate the importance of emerging technologies other than cars. Lots of progress is still possible without AI. Two emerging technologies I am particularly excited about are fusion and space colonization.</p><p>Regulations in one country can stop progress in a single industry. Progress stopping in a particular industry is not that uncommon.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefj46aod916r\"><sup><a href=\"#fnj46aod916r\">[15]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Most innovation in a particular industry is done in one or a few cities. These clusters of innovation are difficult to build and maintain, so if one is crushed by regulation, it typically does not just move to another country. On a broader scale, some countries are much more innovative than others. In most industries, including heavily regulated ones, the USA is clearly more innovative than (most of) Europe or East Asia, which are much more innovative than the rest of the world. A lot has to go right: a high standard of living, an educated populace, the rule of law, the possibility of future profit, available capital, and a culture that encourages innovation. Countries which flaunt international regulations or norms typically do not attract innovation. Once a technology exists, it is much easier for other countries to copy it. The designs and skills needed already exist, and the benefits of the technology are clear. Regulation to prevent innovation is much easier than regulation to prevent proliferation.</p><p>I have previously investigated some Resisted Technological Temptations,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzu0nonydce\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzu0nonydce\">[16]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;or technologies where a long term pause has been achieved through our current institutions:</p><ul><li><strong>Nuclear power</strong>, discussed above.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1x3t7om9jlh\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1x3t7om9jlh\">[17]</a></sup></span></li><li><strong>Geoengineering </strong>is not explicitly illegal, but opposition from scientists and activists has prevented even research from being done.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefm2kptbw9qt\"><sup><a href=\"#fnm2kptbw9qt\">[18]</a></sup></span></li><li><strong>Vaccine development </strong>is heavily regulated in Western countries. During the recent pandemic, both Russia and China relaxed some of these restrictions and approved vaccines before the West. The resulting vaccines were less effective, because the best medical research is still located in the West. In particular,&nbsp;<strong>human challenge trials </strong>have been regulated into almost non-existence.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftz4lpeqeluk\"><sup><a href=\"#fntz4lpeqeluk\">[19]</a></sup></span></li><li><strong>Nuclear weapons </strong>are sometimes mentioned as a technology where regulation has failed to prevent their spread. I think the evidence on this example is mixed. There are about 10 countries which have nuclear weapons (much fewer than the number which could), but only 2 developed them independently: the USA and France. Cutting edge research has not moved to countries which are not party to the Non-Proliferation Treaty. India, Pakistan, and North Korea seem to have similar capabilities as the USA or USSR in the 1940s and 50s.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefn8prv0ep6df\"><sup><a href=\"#fnn8prv0ep6df\">[20]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Testing bans have probably also helped keep nuclear weapons from becoming increasingly powerful: the most powerful bomb ever was detonated in 1961.</li><li><strong>Biological weapons </strong>have some of the strongest treaties and taboos against their development or use,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref35fscox7887\"><sup><a href=\"#fn35fscox7887\">[21]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and no country openly has a biological weapons program. A problem with this example is that the USSR signed treaties against developing biological weapons - and then continued developing them.</li><li>Various nuclear technologies, like&nbsp;<s><strong>atomic gardening</strong></s>,&nbsp;<strong>using nuclear explosions in construction</strong>, or&nbsp;<strong>Project Orion</strong>, have been proposed but not developed.</li><li><strong>Cloning the most effective soldiers&nbsp;</strong>has never been done.</li><li><strong>Genetic modification of humans&nbsp;</strong>has been done by one researcher in China, before he was arrested.</li><li>It is unclear whether&nbsp;<strong>colonialism</strong> counts as a technology. The Ming dynasty\u2019s decision to stop their Treasure Fleets in the early 1400s delayed colonialism globally by about 50 years and may have impacted China\u2019s developmental trajectory for centuries.</li><li><strong>Bell Labs&nbsp;</strong>invented or discovered the transistor, charged-coupled device, photovoltaic cell, information theory, Unix, C, and the cosmic microwave background radiation between 1945-1980.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefisitcxgk2fl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnisitcxgk2fl\">[22]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;After the Bell System was broken up by antitrust laws in 1982, the research community there fragmented. It seems plausible that there are some technologies that were not invented because this unusually prolific center of innovation was destroyed.</li></ul><p>Most technologies are not banned, nor have had their progress stifled by regulation. Most technologies are also not as scary as AI: I have a hard time imagining how solar panels or ballpoint pens could constitute an x-risk. Scary-sounding technologies, like weapons of mass destruction or some kinds of medical research, often do face bans or regulations that make their development no longer worth it, and the bans sometimes work.</p><p>I don\u2019t want to say that effective bans on scary-sounding technologies happen by default. When they do work, they are the result of a concerted effort. But making a ban on a new, potentially dangerous technology seems very doable without disrupting the rest of society.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Maybe AI Will Be Different</h3><p>While this post is mostly about historical precedents of other technologies being stopped, it seems worth saying a few words on AI in particular. There are several reasons why AI might be different from other technologies:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>AI research is easier to do remotely than other emerging technologies.&nbsp;</li><li>Once an AI system is created, it can be transmitted easily, as software.</li><li>Simple economic models suggest that powerful AI would be extremely economically advantageous to whoever adopts it.</li></ol><p>All technologies are different. Some differences make regulations easier or harder, but none of these feel so different that they make regulation impossible:</p><ol><li>Law enforcement can enforce the law based on where the research is done or where the researchers live. The USA in particular has an expansive view of where its law can apply.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrb7tc4clmj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrb7tc4clmj\">[23]</a></sup></span></li><li>Most proposed regulations focus on the hardware required to train powerful AI.</li><li>Policy makers do not know this. They know that someone is telling them this. They definitely do not know that they will get the economic promises of AGI on the timescales they care about, if they support this particular project. These promises are not that distinguishable from other technologies\u2019 hype.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvg7ly0hfbf8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvg7ly0hfbf8\">[24]</a></sup></span></li></ol><p>There are also ways in which regulating AI is easier.</p><p>There are multiple stages of the supply chain where there are only one or a few companies in the world capable of cutting edge work. There are only a few actors who need to coordinate in order for regulation to be effective.</p><p>Current leading AI models require a lot of compute, which is capital intensive and easy to keep track of. This might change with enough improvements from algorithmic efficiency. But we should expect algorithmic progress to dramatically slow down in response to a long term pause on AI as capital and talent moves to other industries.</p><p>Lots of substances and items are regulated, and the details of this regulation vary widely based on what it is and what the government is trying to avoid.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefs0346l9zjff\"><sup><a href=\"#fns0346l9zjff\">[25]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Regulating GPUs will have some unique challenges, but does not seem impossible under our current institutions.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>How Long of a Pause?</h3><p>Most of the historical evidence is for global pauses that have lasted about 50 years. This is useful evidence for discussing a 100 year pause. If \u201clong term\u201d means 1,000 years, then there is much less historical evidence. Matthew Barnett has argued that a regulatory ratchet within existing institutions might accomplish a 50 year pause in AI research, but something more dramatic would be needed for a 1,000 year pause.</p><p>I am skeptical that a global police state would be easier to maintain than more normal regulations for 1,000 years. My model for how to sustain institutions on this time scale is:</p><ol><li>Build an institution that lasts for a generation.</li><li>Convince the rising generation that this institution is a good thing to maintain.</li></ol><p>If you fail at (2), then it does not matter what institution was built. If not even the elite believe that the police state is a good thing, then it will not maintain itself.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjmphxifxp5\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjmphxifxp5\">[26]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;An institution which has less hard power, but is better at getting people to believe in it, is more likely to last 1,000 years.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Building AGI is an extremely uncertain endeavor. It might lead to Our Glorious Future. It might lead to human extinction. It might not even be possible. If we decide to not try to build AGI, the future seems much less uncertain. Society will continue to be clearly not optimal, but also far from dystopian. Making scientific, technological, economic, social, and political progress will continue to be hard, but people will continue to do it. We can continue to hope for at least marginal improvements for our children, and they for their children, long into the future.</p><p>It should not be surprising if a scary-sounding technology faces a regulatory ratchet that slows and then stops all progress in that field.

The percentage of shrimp that make it to slaughter age but are killed before slaughter should be between 0% and 50% with a mean of 25%, but the original model had 50% to 100% with 75% as a mean. The expected value of the shrimp stunning intervention increases as a result from roughly 30 DALYs/$1000 spent to 38 DALYs/$1000 spent.&nbsp;</li><li>EA Forum commenter MHR provided more fine-grained estimates of the global DALY burden of malaria, which I used to update the REU model. This change did not affect the REU results in a discernable way because the DALY burden of malaria is small compared to other DALY burdens (for example, of hens in battery cages), but it is more accurate now. The change was not relevant to the other cost-effectiveness estimates for the Against Malaria Foundation.&nbsp;</li><li>The summary table in the executive summary has been updated so that results reflect the base-10 logarithm of the cost-effectiveness of each intervention under each risk aversion type and level (or, the negative of the base-10 logarithm of the absolute value of the intervention, if the value was negative).&nbsp;</li></ul><h1>Executive Summary</h1><h2>Motivation</h2><p>Imagine you\u2019re faced with the following two choices, A and B, and you can push a button to select one or the other to occur. If you choose A, you will save 10 people\u2019s lives with 99% certainty. If you choose B, you have a 1% chance of saving 1,200 people\u2019s lives and a 99% chance of saving none. Which would you choose?&nbsp;<br><br>Using expected value (EV) maximization,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref20v1utlw1lu\"><sup><a href=\"#fn20v1utlw1lu\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;the answer is straightforward: you choose B, because when you multiply the 1% probability of saving the 1200 people, the expected value of the choice is 12 lives saved, compared to 9.9 for option A.<br><br>But maybe your intuitions say that EV maximization is missing something important. For example, you might be pulled towards A by this thought: \u201cIt\u2019s nearly certain that if I choose B, I save nobody, letting 10 people die who I could almost certainly have saved.\u201d And maybe if you\u2019d still choose B for the stakes considered here (1200 lives with 1% probability), would you be comfortable choosing it if the gamble involved 1.2 trillion lives and had only a 10<sup>-11&nbsp;</sup>probability of success?<br><br>You also might worry about expected value maximization from a different direction: a special concern about avoiding the worst outcomes. Imagine that option A stays the same but now option B involves saving 900 people with a 1% probability, making its expected value lower than that of A. You might think that you should still choose B because you think it\u2019s especially important not to let 900 people die, even if you have a small chance of saving them.&nbsp;<br><br>Finally, you might worry about EV maximization because you might doubt the stipulated probabilities of the choice between A and B. What if you don\u2019t know for certain that there\u2019s a precisely 99% or 1% chance of saving 10 or 1200 lives, even if those are your best estimates? This problem is especially pressing when there could be additional downside risks. How should your decisions change if there\u2019s a third option, C, where you could save 1200 people with an estimated 3% chance of success, but there\u2019s also an estimated 1% chance of causing the deaths of 1800, and, on top of that, you\u2019re not really sure of either probability? Yet again, our considered judgments may not match what EV maximization recommends.<br><br>Questions about how to navigate various types of risk and risk aversion permeate cause prioritization discussions. For example, many people are attracted to movements like effective altruism because they want to know with a high degree of confidence that they\u2019re&nbsp;<i>actually</i> doing good rather than throwing their money away on ineffective philanthropic efforts. On the other hand, there are strong arguments for taking a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/hits-based-giving/\"><u>hits-based giving</u></a> approach in cause areas where the expected value is very high. If you favor spending on existential risk mitigation or insect welfare interventions, you might appeal to the thought that, even if the probabilities of an existential catastrophe or insect sentience are very small, we should err on the side of caution. That is, we should pay special attention to avoid the worst-case scenario where the possibility for flourishing is severely curtailed or large amounts of suffering are allowed to persist. Regardless of where you come down on these questions, it\u2019s incredibly difficult to be confident in the probabilities and values we assign to countless important claims and parameters that affect our cause prioritization calculations. Should we still gamble with our resources when we know so little? If so, how much risk would be too much?</p><p>This report creates mathematical frameworks and tools to address the following question:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>How can the relative cost-effectiveness of donating to different interventions within and between three cause areas (existential and non-existential catastrophic risk mitigation,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvdbhtjvof2j\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvdbhtjvof2j\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;global health and development, and animal welfare) change when we consider risk aversion under decision-theoretic alternatives to expected value theory?&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>This question is explored in the four sections of this report, in which I:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Delve into the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CZ5S-Eayxr64z5YADYR9M3P2WTp4u2Pgb4N-ynYbbMU/edit#heading=h.fm9crph0ovx3\"><u>mathematical models</u></a> used to implement each type of risk aversion&nbsp;</li><li>Describe the procedures and data used to model the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CZ5S-Eayxr64z5YADYR9M3P2WTp4u2Pgb4N-ynYbbMU/edit#heading=h.ityyu7dog8kh\"><u>cost-effectiveness</u></a> of each charitable intervention considered here</li><li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CZ5S-Eayxr64z5YADYR9M3P2WTp4u2Pgb4N-ynYbbMU/edit#heading=h.tnkkhnc7hjoc\"><u>Present and analyze</u></a> the relative cost-effectiveness of each intervention when different types and levels of risk aversion are applied</li><li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CZ5S-Eayxr64z5YADYR9M3P2WTp4u2Pgb4N-ynYbbMU/edit#heading=h.l4oyft3tys8o\"><u>Conclude</u></a> by discussing some limitations of the risk aversion and cost-effectiveness models explored and by describing opportunities for further research which I hope to pursue soon.</li></ol><p>Below is a summary of these four sections, which I expand upon in the rest of the <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CZ5S-Eayxr64z5YADYR9M3P2WTp4u2Pgb4N-ynYbbMU/edit?usp=sharing\">report</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Risk Models Considered</h2><p>In investigating the motivating question above, I disambiguate three broad categories of risk aversion and build cross- and intra-cause comparison models that incorporate different degrees of aversion to each type of risk. These three types of risk aversion are&nbsp;</p><ol><li>\u201cAvoiding the worst\u201d risk aversion: All else equal, we are averse to the worst states of the world arising and want to take actions that prevent them or lessen their badness.&nbsp;</li><li>Difference-making risk aversion: All else equal, we are averse to our actions doing no tangible good in the world or, worse, causing harm.&nbsp;</li><li>Ambiguity aversion: All else equal, we should be particularly cautious when taking actions for which the probabilities of the possible outcomes are unknown and quite uncertain.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>To address risk aversion that cautions us to&nbsp;<i>\u201cavoid the worst\u201d states of the world</i>, I built a model that implements Lara Buchak\u2019s&nbsp;<strong>risk-weighted utility theory (REU)</strong>, as discussed in Buchak\u2019s 2014&nbsp;<a href=\"https://philarchive.org/rec/BUCRAT\"><u>paper</u></a> \u201cRisk and Tradeoffs.\u201d The eight bad states of the world that I consider are combinations of the following events: egg-laying hens are/are not sentient and suffering immensely, shrimp are/are not sentient and suffering immensely, and the value of the future is/is not lost in an existential catastrophe.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, I built three decision theory models that incorporate&nbsp;<i>risk aversion with respect to making a difference</i>. For causes like global health and animal welfare, the definition of \u201cdifference-making\u201d is straightforward: the number of human-equivalent DALYs averted by the intervention. However, for existential risk interventions, what counts as \u201cmaking a difference\u201d is a little more ambiguous: are our actions valuable only if they prevent an existential or non-existential catastrophe that would have otherwise occurred, or is it valuable to merely lower the probability of a catastrophe?&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefc328mdu5xzp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnc328mdu5xzp\">[3]</a></sup></span><br><br>Two of the three difference-making risk aversion models assume that value for existential risk projects is created only if the intervention averts a catastrophe that would have otherwise occurred. The first is a method my colleague, Hayley Clatterbuck,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefm49xy6dbmjb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnm49xy6dbmjb\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and I created which I call&nbsp;<strong>\u201cdifference-making risk-weighted expected utility\u201d (DMREU)</strong>. Modeled on Lara Buchak\u2019s risk-weighted expected utility model, the difference-making risk-weighted expected utility model changes what we mean by the \u201coutcome\u201d to be focused locally on the marginal cost-effectiveness of an intervention. DMREU gives extra weight to outcomes that come out at the beginning of a ranked list from worst to best change in the utility of the world from before to after the intervention. The second model that incorporates difference-making risk aversion is based on Bottomley and Williamson\u2019s 2023&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/phpr.13006\"><u>paper</u></a> on&nbsp;<strong>weighted linear utility theory (WLU)</strong>,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefw7krlx08nuj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnw7krlx08nuj\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;\u201cRational risk-aversion: Good things come to those who weight.\u201d WLU differs from the rank-dependent DMREU model in that it is stakes-sensitive; rather than giving extra weight to the&nbsp;<i>lowest-ranked</i> outcomes, WLU gives extra weight to outcomes we cause in proportion to how bad they are&nbsp;<i>in magnitude</i>.</p><p>Now, suppose we value risk reductions themselves, rather than just existential catastrophes prevented. If we knew the amount by which our actions reduced existential risk, the expected value of the intervention would be clear: just multiply the change in the probability of an existential catastrophe by the amount of counterfactual value saved from preventing a catastrophe. Importantly, however, we are uncertain about our effects on existential risk levels, which creates massive variation in the expected amount of difference made by our actions. The third difference-making risk aversion model is called the<strong> \u201cexpected difference made\u201d (EDM)</strong> risk aversion model. This model uses&nbsp;<strong>ambiguity aversion functions</strong> to aggregate the expected difference-made estimates of donating to existential risk projects while giving disproportionate weight to the worst of the set.&nbsp;</p><p>Like expected difference made risk aversion, implementing REU yields considerable variation in its expected utility estimates when I change the input parameters. As such, I also apply ambiguity aversion functions to aggregate the risk-weighted expected utility estimates created.&nbsp;</p><p>Figure 1 below shows a taxonomy of the risk aversion models developed. The first distinguishing factor is whether the risk aversion model focuses on making a difference or avoiding the worst states of the world. Difference-making models are further subdivided by whether you value lowering the probability of an existential risk occurring (expected difference made + ambiguity aversion) or counterfactually preventing existential catastrophes. Models for the latter (WLU and DMREU) differ in whether they\u2019re stakes-sensitive. REU is the only \u201cavoiding the worst\u201d risk aversion model included. However, we can choose to apply a layer of ambiguity aversion in aggregating the REU results because of the substantial variation in probabilities related to background risk levels and whether and by how much our existential risk mitigation efforts succeed.&nbsp;</p><p><i>Figure 1: A taxonomy of risk-aversion models</i></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9EENSGhiQiKFaRh4t/avlbnkhfcds6gni178ll\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9EENSGhiQiKFaRh4t/jemnb1hdkq9q8smslidh 145w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9EENSGhiQiKFaRh4t/rairmqrmi81i8lhpbdto 225w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9EENSGhiQiKFaRh4t/cxe3kquxqfb388wovvwv 305w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9EENSGhiQiKFaRh4t/gppmdzgrl6sepf97jhy2 385w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9EENSGhiQiKFaRh4t/ydxcusq6klacc4syicaq 465w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9EENSGhiQiKFaRh4t/mzikqdg41d5um9fzm1lo 545w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9EENSGhiQiKFaRh4t/hfqnakgs8sfej5dm5xuh 625w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9EENSGhiQiKFaRh4t/fdks4hupuud3m7b8zlve 705w\"></figure><p>For each of these risk and uncertainty aversion models, I see how the relative cost-effectiveness of several choice EA interventions changes or stays the same with different degrees of risk aversion. I describe these interventions in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CZ5S-Eayxr64z5YADYR9M3P2WTp4u2Pgb4N-ynYbbMU/edit#heading=h.tnkkhnc7hjoc\">r<u>esults section</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><h2>Interventions Considered</h2><p>Amongst the various cause areas popular among effective altruists, it might appear at first that existential risk mitigation interventions might be the most susceptible to risk aversion concerns, especially of the \u201cdifference-making\u201d type, whereas global health and development interventions are safer. It is certainly true that the former interventions deal with great uncertainty: How likely is any intervention to have an impact on existential risk? How confident should we be that any impacts it has are beneficial, and how large are they? When does an intervention deserve counterfactual credit, and how much?&nbsp;</p><p>However, risks of failure are present within other cause areas, too. For instance, even though I\u2019m pretty confident that donating to the Against Malaria Foundation has a positive impact, lobbying to get a new economic or health policy passed is a risky endeavor within global health. Moreover, leaving small probabilities of existential catastrophes unaddressed is also a risky choice if we\u2019re averse to highly unfavorable states of the world coming about (e.g., human civilization being permanently wiped out).&nbsp;</p><p>Animal welfare advocacy faces similar questions: How much should we stick to tried-and-true interventions like cage-free corporate campaigns versus branching out into new areas like shrimp welfare? Here, two forms of risk prevail, mostly surrounding shrimps\u2019 capacity for welfare. First, because shrimp could be sentient (here defined as having a non-zero capacity for welfare), there\u2019s a risk that the level of shrimp suffering in the world is extremely high. However, we might think there\u2019s less evidence for shrimp sentience than there is for hen sentience. So, spending on shrimp welfare has a higher chance of doing no good compared to spending on layer hen welfare.&nbsp;<br><br>With all these considerations in mind, I created at least two intervention profiles for each cause area. Each intervention considered differs based on 1) its expected cost-effectiveness and/or 2) the variance in its cost-effectiveness.&nbsp;</p><p>For global health and development, these include donating to:</p><ul><li>The Against Malaria Foundation, and</li><li>An organization trying to pass road safety laws (e.g., DUI or helmet laws) in developing countries</li></ul><p>For animal welfare, these include donating to organizations that:</p><ul><li>Conduct corporate cage-free campaigns for layer hens,</li><li>Promote stunning for the humane slaughter of farmed shrimp (to relieve suffering from harvest and slaughter), and</li><li>Address unhealthy ammonia concentrations in farmed shrimp\u2019s aqueous environment</li></ul><p>The last intervention is a hypothetical shrimp welfare intervention. I included it as a model to get a more complete range of the possible cost-effectiveness of shrimp welfare interventions, beyond humane slaughter methods.&nbsp;<br><br>Finally, I considered two types of existential risk mitigation interventions:</p><ul><li>One with a lower probability of having an impact, less certainty about the direction of the effect, and higher effect sizes in expectation. This project is labeled the \u201crisky\u201d or \u201chigher-risk, higher-EV\u201d intervention throughout this report.&nbsp;</li><li>One with a higher probability of having an impact, greater certainty about the direction of the effect, and lower effect sizes in expectation. This project is labeled as the \u201cconservative\u201d or \u201clower-risk, lower-EV\u201d intervention throughout this report.</li></ul><p>Assessing the number of years of counterfactual credit involved in existential risk mitigation projects is both incredibly difficult and mightily consequential for the bottom-line cost-effectiveness estimates. To address this, I model both the risky and conservative interventions assuming two very different periods of counterfactual impact: between 100 and 1000 years (with 90% confidence) and between 10,000 and 100,000 years (with 90% confidence).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefps466r9z2qf\"><sup><a href=\"#fnps466r9z2qf\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;These are labeled \u201cnear-term\u201d and \u201clong-term\u201d projects throughout the results section. &nbsp;The variation in the results underscores how, in addition to our uncertainty around how to treat risk, we\u2019re radically uncertain about how to value existential risk mitigation efforts.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3vkg6qqyl4b\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3vkg6qqyl4b\">[7]</a></sup></span></p><h2>Key Takeaways</h2><h3>These Models are Works in Progress</h3><p>As I describe in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1CZ5S-Eayxr64z5YADYR9M3P2WTp4u2Pgb4N-ynYbbMU/edit#heading=h.l4oyft3tys8o\"><u>limitations section</u></a>, this paper cannot definitively answer: \u201cWhat is the relative cost-effectiveness of each cause I could donate to?\u201d However, it does provide a formal guide for addressing the question: \u201cIf I believe [this set of parameters] and assume this methodology for estimating cost-effectiveness, what is the approximate relative value of donating to each intervention under various types and degrees of risk aversion?\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, I\u2019m optimistic that this report provides a good attempt at analyzing how risk aversion can impact intra- and cross-cause cost-effectiveness comparisons\u2013one which can be improved upon as we uncover more empirical evidence and create better frameworks for doing cost-effectiveness analysis.&nbsp;</p><h3>Results</h3><p>Given my modeling assumptions, here are some of the key takeaways from when I apply risk aversion models to analyze the cost-effectiveness of all of the animal welfare, global health, and existential risk interventions.

This result is owing to the following factors: hens are very likely to be sentient, they have moderately high welfare ranges relative to humans, there are billions of hens suffering in battery cages (so the scope is very high), and there is evidence that corporate cage-free campaigns affect many hens per dollar and are quite effective at reducing suffering.&nbsp;</li><li>Moreover, the existing level of hen suffering that probably exists is high enough that \u201cavoid the worst\u201d risk aversion (REU) gives extra value to cage-free campaigns relative to other causes.&nbsp;</li><li>If existential risk mitigation projects have counterfactual effects that last between 10,000 and 100,000 years, then corporate cage-free campaigns are likely less cost-effective than these interventions in expectation. However, the risk-neutral cost-effectiveness of corporate cage-free campaigns is comparable to existential risk projects considered that have periods of counterfactual impact of 100 to 1000 years.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>The value of both the higher-risk, higher-reward and lower-risk, lower-reward existential risk mitigation projects modeled is highly contingent upon the counterfactual period of impact as well as one\u2019s risk attitudes.&nbsp;<ol><li>Interventions with long-lasting counterfactual impacts (10,000 to 100,000 years) are between 5 times to two orders of magnitude more cost-effective under EV maximization and REU (with no ambiguity aversion) than the next-best interventions (the hypothetical shrimp intervention that treats ammonia concentrations and corporate cage-free campaigns).&nbsp;</li><li>The existential risk reduction projects are comparable in risk-neutral expected value, ambiguity-neutral EDM, and ambiguity-neutral REU to corporate cage-free campaigns and the hypothetical shrimp welfare intervention that addresses ammonia concentrations if the counterfactual impact period is 100 to 1000 years.&nbsp;</li><li>However, suppose you\u2019re averse to having no impact on the probability that an existential catastrophe occurs or, worse, raising that probability.<ol><li>Then, under the EDM and ambiguity-averse REU models, the higher-risk, higher-EV existential risk projects decrease dramatically in their relative cost-effectiveness compared to corporate campaigns. At higher levels of ambiguity aversion, they become worse than doing nothing.&nbsp;</li><li>On the other hand, both EDM and ambiguity-averse REU demonstrate that existential risk interventions can be robustly positive and cost-effective if the intervention has a high chance of having an impact and a low chance of backfiring.&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li>Finally, suppose you care about difference-making in the sense of not spending money on interventions that cause or don\u2019t counterfactually prevent catastrophes.&nbsp;<ol><li>Then, the DMREU and WLU model results show that even small amounts of risk aversion of this form are enough to make the higher-risk, higher-EV existential risk projects considered worse than doing nothing.&nbsp;</li><li>The lower-risk, lower-EV existential risk projects are robust up to a low amount of difference-making risk aversion, but moderate levels are enough to make the risk of doing nothing or harming the world too overwhelming.&nbsp;</li><li>Say you need the probability of saving 1000 people in a forced gamble to be at least 3% in order to choose this risky option over saving 10 people with 100% certainty. In that case, DMREU suggests you would not want to donate to any of the existential risk projects we considered.&nbsp;</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Under all models except ambiguity-neutral REU, whether the hypothetical shrimp welfare intervention that targets unhealthy ammonia concentrations is over an order of magnitude more cost-effective than the Against Malaria Foundation\u2019s work is dependent on one\u2019s level of risk aversion.&nbsp;<ol><li>This contingency arises because we put a wide range on the probability of shrimp sentience that is, on average, relatively low. Additionally, we have great uncertainty about shrimps\u2019 welfare range relative to humans (or hens, for that matter). As such, there is a high probability of doing little good by spending on shrimp welfare interventions even though the risk-neutral expected value of interventions that target welfare threats like ammonia could be very high.&nbsp;</li><li>Under ambiguity-neutral REU, the possibility that shrimp are suffering greatly from high ammonia concentrations is given disproportionate weight compared to the risk-neutral expected utility calculations. As a consequence, this high risk of suffering balances out some of the uncertainty around shrimps\u2019 capacity for welfare.&nbsp;<ol><li>Concretely, the change in the risk-weighted expected utility of spending on the hypothetical ammonia intervention over doing nothing is about an order of magnitude greater than the change in the risk-weighted expected utility of spending on the Against Malaria Foundation over doing nothing.&nbsp;</li><li>However, introducing ambiguity aversion on top of risk-weighted expected utility is enough for the cost-effectiveness of spending on the ammonia-targeting shrimp welfare intervention to become within an order of magnitude of that of the Against Malaria Foundation.</li></ol></li><li>Under all three difference-making risk aversion models (DMREU, WLU, and EDM), the relative cost-effectiveness of donating to the ammonia intervention and the Against Malaria Foundation also changes significantly with different risk preferences. Nevertheless, the ammonia intervention is likely more cost-effective than donating to the Against Malaria Foundation under low to moderate levels of risk aversion.&nbsp;<ol><li>Say you need the probability of saving 1000 people in a forced gamble to be at least 5% in order to choose this risky option over saving 10 people with 100% certainty. In this case, donating to the Against Malaria Foundation is probably within an order of magnitude as cost-effective as the hypothetical ammonia intervention under the DMREU model. At lower levels of risk aversion, the shrimp intervention is likely more cost-effective by an order of magnitude using the DMREU model.&nbsp;</li><li>Under the WLU model, donating to the Against Malaria Foundation is within an order of magnitude as cost-effective as donating to the hypothetical ammonia intervention at the two highest levels of risk aversion tested.&nbsp;</li><li>Under the expected-differences made model, the two interventions were within an order of magnitude as cost-effective as each other at the higher level of ambiguity aversion tested.</li><li>At all other levels of difference-making risk aversion, the hypothetical ammonia intervention is likely more choice-worthy at current margins.&nbsp;</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>Within global health and development, the cost-effectiveness of the road safety legislation intervention that has a ~24% chance of succeeding is roughly equal under risk-neutral expected value theory to that of the Against Malaria Foundation. However, introducing low-to-moderate levels of difference-making risk aversion against having zero impact is enough to cut the relative cost-effectiveness of road safety interventions by at least 50% under DMREU, WLU, and EDM.&nbsp;</li><li>Point (4) underscores how risk aversion doesn\u2019t prefer one cause area over another inherently\u2013rather, it\u2019s a way of assessing altruistic efforts under a complex set of preferences about making a difference and avoiding bad outcomes that affect intra-cause comparisons as well as inter-cause comparisons.&nbsp;</li><li>Finally, shrimp welfare interventions that reform how shrimp are harvested and slaughtered by implementing stunning machines are probably between one to two orders of magnitude less cost-effective in expectation than the hypothetical ammonia intervention. This result arises because harvest and slaughter make up a small proportion of shrimps\u2019 lives compared to other welfare threats that have a longer duration, such as addressing unhealthy levels of ammonia concentration.&nbsp;<ol><li>This conclusion is admittedly speculative. I do not know how much an intervention targeting ammonia concentrations would cost, how likely it is to succeed, or the fraction of shrimp globally it could affect per amount of money spent. I\u2019m assuming the values for these parameters are similar to those for the shrimp stunning intervention. However, it could be that such interventions are infeasible in the short term, whereas stunning interventions might be more likely to succeed right now. Alternatively, ammonia mitigation interventions might be even more cost-effective than is assumed here.&nbsp;</li><li>Under this report\u2019s modeling assumptions, the estimated expected number of sentience-adjusted, human-equivalent DALYs averted by the shrimp stunning intervention is about 38 DALYs/$1000, compared to about 1500 DALYs/$1000 for the hypothetical intervention that addresses ammonia concentrations and 19 DALYs/$1000 for the Against Malaria Foundation.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefq66vrj74bxm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnq66vrj74bxm\">[10]</a></sup></span></li></ol></li></ol><h3>Table Summary of Results</h3><p>In Table 1 below, I summarize the cost-effectiveness results from each cause for all the risk aversion theories and at different levels of risk aversion. The interventions are scored by how many orders of magnitude the cost-effectiveness estimate was above zero, per $1000 spent. If an intervention had a negative value, then the score in the table equals the negative of the base-10 logarithm applied to the absolute value of the cost-effectiveness estimate. A score of 3.5, for example, means the intervention\u2019s cost-effectiveness is&nbsp;103.5=3162&nbsp;risk-weighted units per $1000 spent. A score of -5 signifies that the intervention\u2019s cost-effectiveness was -100,000 risk-weighted units per $1000 spent when risk aversion was applied (i.e., it\u2019s worse than doing nothing).&nbsp;</p><p>The scores are best compared within columns because the units of cost-effectiveness can differ when different types of risk aversion are applied. However, high positive cost-effectiveness across many risk aversion types and levels is evidence of a cause\u2019s robustness.</p><p><i>Table 1: Interventions ranked by cost-effectiveness, in orders of magnitude above zero, per $1000 spent.&nbsp;</i></p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:0.6000000000000001pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\">Cause</td><td style=\"border:0.6000000000000001pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\">Risk-Neutral EV Maximixation</td><td style=\"border:0.6000000000000001pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\">DMREU, moderate risk aversion (0.05)</td><td style=\"border:0.6000000000000001pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\">WLU, moderate risk aversion (0.10)</td><td style=\"border:0.6000000000000001pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\">EDM, lower ambiguity aversion</td><td style=\"border:0.6000000000000001pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\">EDM, higher ambiguity aversion</td><td style=\"border:0.6000000000000001pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\">REU, Moderate risk aversion, ambiguity -

Billions are being poured into AI capabilities, and the results are staggering. New models are <a href=\"https://pauseai.info/sota\"><u>outperforming humans</u></a> in a lot of domains. As capabilities increase, so do the <a href=\"https://pauseai.info/risks\"><u>risks</u></a>. Scientists are even <a href=\"https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk\"><u>warning</u></a> that AI might <a href=\"https://pauseai.info/xrisk\"><u>end up destroying humanity</u></a>. This dire outcome not only seems possible, but also likely, as the average probability estimates for these outcomes <a href=\"https://pauseai.info/polls-and-surveys\"><u>range from 14% to 40%</u></a>.</p><p>We need our leaders to listen to these warnings, but they are not taking this topic remotely as seriously as they should. There is AI safety legislation being drafted, but <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PauseAI/status/1704998018322141496\"><u>not a single measure would actually prevent or delay superintelligent AI</u></a>. <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/8/18/23836362/ai-slow-down-poll-regulation\"><u>Over 70%</u></a> wants to slow down AI, and <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2023/9/19/23879648/americans-artificial-general-intelligence-ai-policy-poll\"><u>over 60%</u></a> want regulation to actively prevent superintelligent AI. Why is there no legislation draft that actually does this?

Regulations and hardware restrictions should apply before training has started as it is very difficult to control dissemination once a new capability has been achieved. . We cannot allow companies to train potentially world-ending AI models. Writing legislation is hard, and it takes time, but we may not have that long, so work as if your life depends on it.

Crops would fail, and many millions would be without food. Much of the research on mitigating the effects of these catastrophes is the product of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://allfed.info/\"><u>ALLFED</u></a>. Their work has been transformative for the field, but may be seen by some as overly pessimistic about the likelihood of agricultural shortfalls, and overly optimistic about the effectiveness of their suggested interventions. This project aims to provide a neutral \u201csecond opinion\u201d on the cost-effectiveness of mitigating ASRSs.</p><p>Nuclear winter is probably the most likely cause of an ASRS, although the size of the threat is&nbsp;highly uncertain. Nuclear weapons have only once been used in war, and opinions differ on the likelihood of a future large-scale conflict. Even if there is a major nuclear war, the climate effects are contested. Much of the scientific literature on nuclear winter is the product of a small group of scientists who may be politically motivated to exaggerate the effects. Critics point to the long chain of reasoning that connects nuclear war to nuclear winter, and argue that slightly less pessimistic assumptions at each stage can lead to radically milder climate effects. <strong>We predict that there is just a 20% chance that nuclear winter follows large-scale nuclear war</strong>. Even so, this implies that nuclear winter represents over 95% of the total ASRS threat.</p><p>There are a number of ways to prepare: making plans; fortifying our networks of communication and trade; building food stockpiles; developing more resilient food sources. After a period of exploration, we decided to focus on the cost-effectiveness of conducting a pilot study for one resilient food source. <a href=\"https://allfed.info/resilient-foods\">\u201cResilient\u201d food sources</a>, such as seaweed, mass-produced greenhouses, or edible sugars derived from plant matter, can produce food when conventional agriculture fails, mitigating the food shortage. We know that these sources can produce edible food, but none have had pilot studies that identify the key bottlenecks in scaling up the process rapidly in a catastrophe. We believe that such a pilot study would increase the chances of the resilient food source being deployed in an ASRS, and that the lessons learnt in the study would enable the food source to be harnessed more productively.</p><p>We assume that resilient foods would not make a significant difference in milder scenarios, although this is far from certain<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgk0uaiz75is\"><sup><a href=\"#fngk0uaiz75is\">[3]</a></sup></span>.

We attempt to model the counterfactual effect of the pilot itself on the deployment of the food source in a catastrophe. Due to lack of reliable data, however, we rely heavily on subjective discounts.</p><p>We estimate that a&nbsp;<strong>USD 23 million&nbsp;</strong>pilot study for one resilient food source would counterfactually reduce famine mortality by&nbsp;<strong>0.66%&nbsp;</strong>in the event of an ASRS, preventing approximately 16 million deaths from famine.&nbsp;</p><p>Mortality represents 80% of the expected burden of an ASRS in our model, with the remainder coming from&nbsp;morbidity and economic losses. There is some uncertainty about the scale of the economic damage, but we are confident that famine deaths would form the bulk of the burden. We do not consider the long-term benefits of mitigating mass global famine.</p><p>Our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U8NtEQgXP7pouvHiXCn6x6-UzoXhQPkpSYfMLpfAOEE/edit#gid=1239700791\"><u>full CEA</u></a> assesses the intervention in detail.

The result is highly uncertain and is especially contingent on 1) the likelihood of nuclear winter and 2) the degree to which evidence from a pilot study would influence government decision-making in a catastrophe.</p><h1>Cost-effectiveness</h1><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U8NtEQgXP7pouvHiXCn6x6-UzoXhQPkpSYfMLpfAOEE/edit#gid=1239700791\"><i><u>Link to full CEA.</u></i></a></p><p>Overall, we estimate that developing one resilient food source would cost approximately&nbsp;<strong>USD 23 million&nbsp;</strong>and would reduce the number of famine deaths in a global agricultural shortfall by&nbsp;<strong>0.66%</strong>.

The lesson, in short, is that it is often helpful to control for a thinker\u2019s big idea. That is, a proponent of a big idea may often overstate the plausibility or significance of their big idea, especially if this thinker\u2019s intellectual persona has become strongly tied to that idea.</p><p>This is in some sense a trivial lesson, but it is also a lesson that seems to emerge quite consistently when one does research and tries to form a view on virtually any topic. Since I have not seen anyone write about this basic yet important point, I thought it might be worth doing so here (though others have probably written about it somewhere, and awareness of the phenomenon is no doubt widespread among professional researchers).</p><h1>Typical patterns of overstatement, overconfidence, and overemphasis</h1><p>The tendency for a thinker to overstate their big idea often takes the following form: in a condition where many different factors contribute to some given effect, a thinker with a big idea can be inclined to highlight one particular factor, and to then confidently present this one factor as though it is the only relevant one, in effect downplaying other plausible factors.</p><p>Another example might be when a thinker narrowly advocates their own approach to a particular problem, whereby they quietly neglect other approaches that may be similarly, or even more, helpful.</p><p>In many cases, the overstatement mostly takes the form of skewed emphasis and framing rather than explicit claims about the relative importance of different factors or approaches.</p><h1>Analogy to sports fans</h1><p>An illustrative analogy might be sports fans who are deeply invested in their favorite team. For example, if a group of football fans argue that their favorite team is objectively the best one ever, we would rightly be skeptical of this assessment. Likewise, if such fans complain that referee calls against their team tend to be deeply unfair, we should hardly be eager to trust them. The sports fans are not impartial judges on these matters.</p><p>While we might prefer to think that intellectuals are fundamentally different from dedicated sports fans, it seems that there are nevertheless some significant similarities. For instance, in both cases, identity and reputation tend to be on the line, and unconscious biases often push beliefs in self-serving directions.</p><p>Indeed, across <a href=\"https://www.elephantinthebrain.com/outline.html\">many</a> <a href=\"https://magnusvinding.com/2022/05/06/team-victory-as-a-key-hidden-motive/\">domains</a> of life, we humans frequently act more like sports fans than we would like to admit. Hence, the point here is not that intellectuals are uniquely similar to sports fans, but simply that intellectuals are <i>also</i> \u2014 like everyone else \u2014 quite like sports fans in some significant respects, such as when they cheer for their own ideas. (An important corollary of this observation is that we usually need to consult the work of many different thinkers if we are to acquire a balanced picture of a given issue \u2014 an insight that is, of course, also widely appreciated among professional researchers.)</p><p>I should likewise clarify that my point isn\u2019t that scholars with a big idea cannot be right about their big idea; sometimes they are. My point is merely that if a thinker is promoting some big idea that has become tied to their identity and reputation, then we have good reason to be a priori skeptical of this thinker\u2019s own assessment of the idea. (And, of course, this point about a priori skepticism also applies to me, to the extent that I am advancing any particular idea, big or small.)</p><h1>Controlling for the distorting influence of overconfidence and skewed emphases</h1><p>Why do people, both scholars and laypeople, often state their views with excessive confidence? Studies suggest that a big part of the reason is that overconfidence quite simply works at persuading others.</p><p>Specifically, in <a href=\"https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/162515/1/88309116X.pdf\">studies</a> where individuals can earn money if they convince others that they did well in an intelligence test, participants tend to display overconfidence in order to be more convincing, and this overconfidence in turn makes them significantly more persuasive to their audience. In other words, overconfidence can be an effective tool for influencing and even outright distorting the beliefs of receivers.</p><p>These findings suggest that we actively need to control for overconfidence, lest our minds fall for its seductive powers. Similar points apply to communication that emphasizes some ideas while unduly neglecting others. That is, it is not just overconfidence that can distort the beliefs of receivers, but also the undue neglect of alternative views, interpretations, approaches, and so on (cf. the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic\">availability heuristic</a> and other <a href=\"https://magnusvinding.com/2022/12/08/distrusting-salience-keeping-unseen-urgencies-in-mind/\">salience-related biases</a>).</p><h1>Examples of thinkers with big ideas</h1><p>Below, I will briefly list some examples of thinkers who appear, in my view, to overstate or overemphasize one or more big ideas. I should note that I think each of the thinkers mentioned below has made important contributions that are worth studying closely, even if they may at times overstate their big ideas.</p><h2>Kristin Neff and self-compassion</h2><p>Kristin Neff places a strong emphasis on self-compassion. In her <a href=\"https://youtu.be/IvtZBUSplr4?si=YwEsEdMxbIa7nk7E&amp;t=13\">own words</a>: \u201cI guess you could say that I am a self-compassion evangelist\u201d. And there is indeed a <a href=\"https://self-compassion.org/the-research/\">large literature</a> that supports its wide-ranging benefits, from increased self-control to greater wellbeing. Even so, it seems to me that Neff overemphasizes self-compassion relative to other important traits and constructs, such as compassion for others, which is <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8287292/\">also associated</a> with various benefits. (In contrast to Neff, many psychologists working in the tradition of compassion-focused therapy display a more balanced focus on compassion for both self and others, see e.g. Gilbert et al., <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22903867/\">2011</a>; Kirby et al., <a href=\"https://self-compassion.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Kirby2019.pdf\">2019</a>.)</p><p>One might object that Neff specializes in self-compassion and that she cannot be expected to compare self-compassion to other important traits and constructs. That might be a fair objection, but it is also an objection that in some sense grants the core point of this post, namely that we should not expect scholars to provide a balanced assessment of their own big ideas (relative to other ideas and approaches).</p><h2>Jonathan Haidt and the social intuitionist model of moral judgment</h2><p>Jonathan Haidt has prominently defended a <a href=\"https://www.its.caltech.edu/~squartz/haidt.pdf\">social intuitionist approach</a> to moral judgment. Simply put, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_intuitionism\">this model</a> says that our moral judgments are almost always dictated by immediate intuitions and then later rationalized by reasons.</p><p>Haidt\u2019s model no doubt has a lot of truth to it, as virtually all of his critics seem to concede: our intuitions do play a large role in forming our moral judgments, and the reasons we give to justify our moral judgments are often just post-hoc rationalizations. The problem, however, is that Haidt appears to greatly understate the role that reasons and reasoning can play in moral judgments. That is, there is a lot of evidence suggesting that moral reasoning often does play an important role in people\u2019s moral judgments, and that it frequently plays a larger role than Haidt\u2019s model seems to allow (see e.g. Narvaez, <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285014305_The_social_intuitionist_model_Some_counterintuitions\">2008</a>; Paxton &amp; Greene, <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1756-8765.2010.01096.x\">2010</a>; Feinberg et al., <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797611434747\">2012</a>).</p><h2>David Pinsof and hidden status motives</h2><p>David Pinsof <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBpp1we2bto\">emphasizes</a> the hidden status motives underlying human behavior. In a world where people systematically underestimate the influence of status motives, Pinsof\u2019s <a href=\"https://psyarxiv.com/avh9t\">work</a> seems like a valuable contribution. Yet it also seems like he often goes too far and overstates the role of status motives at the expense of other motives (which admittedly makes for an <a href=\"https://everythingisbullshit.substack.com/p/you-will-find-this-interesting\">interesting</a> story about human behavior). Likewise, it appears that Pinsof makes overly strong claims about the need to hide status motives.</p><p>In particular, Pinsof <a href=\"https://everythingisbullshit.substack.com/p/status-is-weird\">argues</a> that drives for status cannot be openly acknowledged, as that would be self-defeating and undermine our status. Why? Because acknowledging our status drives makes us look like mere status-seekers, and mere status-seekers seem selfish, dishonest, and like they have low status. But this seems inaccurate to me, and like it assumes that humans are entirely driven by status motives, while simultaneously needing to seem altogether uninfluenced by status motives. An alternative view is that status motives exert a significant, though not all-powerful, pull on our behavior, and acknowledging this pull need not make us appear selfish, dishonest, or low-status. On the contrary, admitting that we have status drives (as everyone does) may signal a high level of self-awareness and honesty, and it hardly needs to paint us as selfish or low-status (since again, we are simply acknowledging that we possess some basic drives that are shared by everyone).</p><p>It is also worth noting that Pinsof seems to contradict himself in this regard, since he himself <a href=\"https://everythingisbullshit.substack.com/p/psychologizing-psychologists\">openly acknowledges</a> his own status drives, and he does not appear to believe that this open acknowledgment is self-defeating or greatly detrimental to his social status, perhaps quite the contrary. Indeed, by openly discussing both his own and others\u2019 hidden status motives, it seems that Pinsof has greatly <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBpp1we2bto\">boosted</a> his social status rather than undermined it.</p><h2>Robin Hanson and grabby aliens</h2><p>Robin Hanson has many big ideas, and he seems overconfident about many of them, from <a href=\"http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/futarchy.html\">futarchy</a> to <a href=\"https://grabbyaliens.com/\">grabby aliens</a>. To keep this section short, I will focus on his ideas related to grabby aliens, which basically entail that loud and clearly visible aliens explain why we find ourselves at such an early time in the history of the universe, as such aliens would prevent later origin dates.</p><p>To be clear, I think Hanson et al.\u2019s grabby aliens model is an important contribution. The model makes some simplifying assumptions, such as dividing aliens into quiet aliens that \u201cdon\u2019t expand or change much\u201d and loud aliens that \u201cvisibly change the volumes they control\u201d, and Hanson et al. then proceed to explore the implications of these simplifying assumptions, which makes sense. Where things get problematic, however, is when Hanson goes on to make strong statements based on his model, without adding the qualification that his conclusions rely on some strong and highly simplifying assumptions. An example of a strong statement is the <a href=\"https://grabbyaliens.com/\">claim</a> that loud aliens are \u201cour most robust explanation for why humans have appeared so early in the history of the universe.\u201d</p><p>Yet there are many ways in which the simplifying assumptions of the model might be wrong, and which Hanson seems to either ignore or overconfidently dismiss. To mention just two: First, it is conceivable that much later origin dates are impossible, or at least prohibitively improbable, due to certain stellar and planetary conditions becoming highly unfavorable to complex life in the future (cf. thegreatatuin, <a href=\"https://thegreatatuin.wordpress.com/2016/10/03/the-solar-system-why-earth/\">2016</a>; <a href=\"https://thegreatatuin.wordpress.com/2017/01/29/on-the-death-of-planets/\">2017</a>). Since we do not have a good understanding of the conditions necessary for the evolution of complex life, it seems that we ought to place a significant probability on this possibility (while also placing a significant probability on the assumption that the evolution of complex life will remain possible for at least a trillion years).</p><p>Second, Hanson et al.\u2019s basic model might be wrong in that expansionist alien civilizations could generally converge to be quiet, in the sense of not being clearly visible; or at least some fraction of expansionist civilizations could be quiet (both possibilities are excluded by Hanson et al.\u2019s model). This is not a minor detail, since if we admit the possibility of such aliens, then our observations do not necessarily give us much evidence about expansionist aliens, and such aliens could even <a href=\"https://magnusvinding.com/2023/07/24/can-we-confidently-dismiss-the-existence-of-near-aliens-probabilities-and-implications/\">be here already</a>. Likewise, quiet expansionist aliens could be the explanation for early origin dates rather than loud expansionist ones.</p><p>When considering such alternative explanations, it becomes clear that the claim that loud aliens explain our seemingly early position in time is just one among many hypotheses, and it is quite debatable whether it is the most plausible or robust one.</p><h2>David Pearce and the abolitionist project</h2><p>David Pearce is another thinker who has <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36246153-can-biotechnology-abolish-suffering\">many big and profound ideas</a>. By far the biggest of these ideas is that we should use biotechnology to <a href=\"https://www.abolitionist.com/\">abolish suffering</a> throughout the living world, what he calls the abolitionist project. This is an idea that I strongly support in principle. Yet where I would disagree with Pearce, and where it seems to me that he is overconfident, is when it comes to the question of whether pushing for the abolitionist project is the best use of marginal resources for those seeking to reduce suffering.</p><p>Specifically, when we consider the <a href=\"https://centerforreducingsuffering.org/research/intro/\">risk</a> of worst-case outcomes due to bad values and political dynamics, it seems likely that other aims are more pressing, such as <a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/the-case-for-promoting-suffering-focused-ethics/\">increasing the priority</a> that humanity devotes to the reduction of suffering, as well as <a href=\"https://magnusvinding.com/2022/03/03/reasoned-politics/\">improving our institutions</a> such that they are less prone to worst-case outcomes (see also Tomasik, <a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/dont-focus-hedonistic-imperative/\">2016</a>; Vinding, <a href=\"https://magnusvinding.files.wordpress.com/2020/05/suffering-focused-ethics.pdf\">2020</a>, ch. 13; <a href=\"https://magnusvinding.com/2021/08/09/reasons-not-to-prioritize-the-abolitionist-project/\">2021</a>; <a href=\"https://magnusvinding.com/2022/07/07/why-i-dont-prioritize-consciousness-research/\">2022</a>). At the very least, it seems that there is considerable uncertainty as to which specific priorities are most helpful for reducing suffering.</p><h2>Other examples</h2><p>Some other examples of thinkers who appear to overstate their big ideas include Bryan Caplan and Jason Brennan with their <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/698866.The_Myth_of_the_Rational_Voter\">strong claims</a> <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29452500-against-democracy\">against democracy</a> (see e.g. Farrell et al., <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/analytical-democratic-theory-a-microfoundational-approach/739A9A928A99A47994E4585059B03398\">2022</a>), as well as Paul Bloom when he makes <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29100194-against-empathy\">strong claims</a> against the utility of emotional empathy (see e.g. Christov-Moore &amp; Iacoboni, <a href=\"https://www.bostonreview.net/forum_response/leonardo-christov-moore-marco-iacoboni-response-against-empathy-iacoboni/\">2014</a>; Ashar et al., <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5532453/\">2017</a>; Barish, <a href=\"https://esmed.org/MRA/mra/article/view/3710/99193546838\">2023</a>).</p><p>Indeed, Bloom\u2019s widely publicized case against empathy is a good example of how the problem is not confined to just a single individual who overstates their own big idea, as there is also often a tendency among publishers and the media to push strong and dramatic claims that grab people\u2019s attention. This can serve as yet another force that pushes us toward hearing strong claims and simple narratives, and away from getting sober and accurate perspectives, which are often more complex and nuanced. (For example, contrast Bloom\u2019s case against empathy with the more complex perspective that emerges in Ashar et al., <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5532453/\">2017</a>.)</p><h1>Concluding note: The deeper point applies to all of us</h1><p>Both for promoters and consumers of ideas, it is worth being wary of the tendency to become unduly attached to any single idea or perspective (i.e. attached based on insufficient reasons or evidence).

As someone living in the West I think this aligns with \"Tell Culture,\" as people are encouraged to voice their needs and opinions. Western cultures generally value straightforward and explicit communication.

Some situations and individuals may lean more towards Ask and others to Tell Culture, while others may  reflect Guess Culture.</p>\n<p>What are the implications? If an Ask culture AI or human interacted with a Tell culture AI or human, there might be some challenges in communication and decision-making. The Ask culture AI may be more passive and wait for explicit requests or information, while the Tell culture AI may proactively provide information or make decisions without being asked. This could lead to potential misunderstandings or frustration, as their communication styles may not align well.</p>\n<p>In Ask-Ask interactions, both AIs may tend to wait for the other to ask questions or seek information, potentially leading to slow initiative or progress.</p>\n<p>In Tell-Tell interactions, both AIs may constantly provide information and make decisions without necessarily seeking input or questions from the other. This could result in faster conflict or collaboration.</p>\n<p>The effectiveness of these interactions may depend on the context, technological and human norms and the adaptability of the AIs to recognize and accommodate different communication styles.</p>\n<p>This frameworks is a simplifie hypothetical model and doesn't cover all possible combinations and variations in communication and interaction styles.

Ahead of that, I wanted to share some information about the roles I\u2019m hiring for on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/new-roles-on-our-gcr-team/#5-technical-ai-safety\"><u>my team</u></a> (Technical AI Safety). This team is aiming to think through what technical research could most help us understand and reduce AI x-risk, and build thriving fields in high priority research areas by making grants to great projects and research groups.</p><p>First of all \u2014 since we initially listed roles on Sep 29, we\u2019ve added three new roles in Technical AI Safety that you might not have seen yet if you only saw the original announcement! In addition to the&nbsp;<strong>(Senior) Program Associate</strong> role that was there originally, we added an&nbsp;<strong>Executive Assistant</strong> role last week \u2014 and yesterday we added a&nbsp;<strong>(Senior) Research Associate</strong> role and a role for a&nbsp;<strong>Senior Program Associate specializing in a particular subfield</strong> of AI safety research (e.g. interpretability, alignment theory, etc). Check those out if they seem interesting! The Executive Assistant role in particular requires a very different, less technical skill set.</p><p>Secondly, before starting to answer AMA questions, I wanted to highlight that&nbsp;<strong>our technical AI safety giving is far away from where it should be at equilibrium, there is considerable room to grow, and hiring more people is likely to lead quickly to more and better grants</strong>. My estimate is that last year, we recommended around ~$25M in grants to technical AI safety,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1ilfb1j8jzv\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1ilfb1j8jzv\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and so far this year I\u2019ve recommended a similar amount. With more capacity for grant evaluation, research, and operations, we think this could pretty readily double or more.</p><p>All of our GCR teams (Technical AI Safety led by me, Capacity Building led by Claire Zabel, AI Governance and Policy led by Luke Muehlhauser, and Biosecurity led by Andrew Snyder-Beattie) are heavily capacity constrained right now \u2014 especially the teams that do work related to AI, given the recent boom in interest and activity in that area. I think my team currently faces even more severe constraints than other program teams. Compared to other teams, my team:</p><ul><li><strong>Is much smaller:&nbsp;</strong>Until literally last week, it was just me focusing primarily on technical AI safety (although Claire\u2019s team sometimes funds technical AI safety work, primarily upskilling). Last week,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/max-nadeau/\"><u>Max Nadeau</u></a> joined as my first Program Associate. In contrast, the capacity building team has eight people, and the biosecurity and AI governance teams each have five people.</li><li><strong>Likely has worse \u201ccoverage\u201d of its field:&nbsp;</strong><ul><li>Ideally, a robust and committed grantmaking team in a given field would:<ul><li>Maintain substantive relationships with the most impactful / promising (say) 5-30% of existing grantees, potential grantees, and key non-grantee players (e.g. people working on AI safety in industry labs) in their field.</li><li>Have pretty robust systems for hearing about most of the plausible potential new grantees in their field (via e.g. application forms or strong referral networks).</li><li>Have the bandwidth to give non-trivial consideration to a large fraction of plausible potential grantees, in order to make an informed, explicit decision about whether to fund them and how much.</li><li>Have the bandwidth to retrospectively evaluate what came out of large grants or important categories of grant.</li></ul></li><li>My team has absolutely nowhere near that level of coverage (for example, we haven\u2019t had the time to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dua879FhtLf9jqyJo/there-should-be-more-ai-safety-orgs?commentId=dQL4yD7HzdfgqBKKs\"><u>open application forms</u></a> or to get to know academics who could work on safety). While all our GCR program areas could use a lot more \u201cfield coverage,\u201d my guess is that our coverage in technical AI safety is considerably worse than the coverage that at least Claire and Andrew get in their fields. Not only does this team have fewer people to cover its field with, the set of plausible potential players feels like it could well be larger, since large numbers of technical people have started to get a lot more interested in AI safety recently.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Has a more nascent strategy:&nbsp;</strong>While we\u2019ve been funding technical AI safety research in one form or another since 2015, the program area has switched leadership and strategic direction multiple times,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcypkhu1prv\"><sup><a href=\"#fncypkhu1prv\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and the current iteration is pretty close to a fresh slate \u2014 we\u2019ve closed out most of our old programs and are looking to build out a fresh stable of grantmaking initiatives from the ground up.<ul><li>One reason our strategy is up in the air is that the team in its current iteration is very new, and advances in AI capabilities are rapidly changing the landscape of tractable research projects. I\u2019ve led the program area for less than a year, and most of the grants I\u2019ve made have been to new groups that didn\u2019t exist before 2021 and/or to research projects that weren\u2019t even practically feasible to do before the last couple of years. In contrast, other program leads have been building out a strategy for a few years or more.</li><li>Another big reason is that we have a huge number of unanswered questions about what technical projects we most want to see, what kind of results would most change our mind about key questions or move the needle on key safety techniques, and how we should prioritize between different streams of object-level work. For example, better answers to questions like these could change what research areas we go big on and what we pitch to potential grantees:<ul><li>How can we tell how promising an interpretability technique is? What are the best \u201cinternal validity\u201d measures of success? What are the best downstream tasks to measure?</li><li>What are the elements of an ideal&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ChDH335ckdvpxXaXX/model-organisms-of-misalignment-the-case-for-a-new-pillar-of-1\"><u>model organism for misalignment</u></a>, and what are the challenges to creating such a model?</li><li>What is the most compelling theory of change / path to impact for research on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://llm-attacks.org/\"><u>adversarial attacks and defenses</u></a>, and what is the most exciting version of that kind of research?</li><li>Are there some empirical research directions inspired by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~russell/papers/neurips20ws-assistance\"><u>the assistance games / reward uncertainty tradition</u></a> which could be helpful even in a language model paradigm?</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>If you join the technical AI safety team in this round, you could help relieve some severe bottlenecks while building this new iteration of the program area from the ground up.

Each student is assigned a personal mentor. Mentors are <strong>compensated</strong> to ensure that they take their job seriously. <strong>Increasingly, mentors are current Malengo students from older cohorts.</strong></p><p>An important element of Malengo\u2019s mentorship is to promote Malengo\u2019s organizational values; they are shown below.</p><figure class=\"table\" style=\"width:1000px\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:0.75em\" colspan=\"2\"><strong>Malengo\u2019s Values</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:0.75em\">1</td><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:0.75em\"><strong>Student welfare: Our goal is to improve the lives of the students we work with. </strong>When organizational goals seem in conflict, student welfare trumps other concerns (e.g. growth).

For example, on several occasions, our lawyer supported students in interacting with landlords and employers who didn\u2019t follow the rules. Students who deal with stress and isolation have received support and referrals from our clinical psychologist.</p><h2>Initial Data on the Impact of the Uganda\u2013Germany program</h2><p>The data our research team (more on them below) collects on our applicants allows us to give a sense of their background. Our students come from low-income families, living on $1.40 per person per day ($42 per person per month) before program entry. Women make up 33% of the first cohort, 59% of the second cohort, and 35% of the third cohort. For the 2024 intake, we will target a share of 50% women.</p><p>After the first year of studies, students have to cover their living expenses through part-time jobs (as is typical in Germany). The 23 students of the first two cohorts report earning an average of $905 per month after 11 months in Germany, after taxes. This represents a 2,200% increase relative to their consumption before the program (1,000% after taking prices into account). It is sufficient to cover all expenses, and roughly in line with the German government\u2019s official guidelines on the required budget for students (EUR 934 per month). The average is likely to increase over time, as students in their first year of studies transition from Malengo\u2019s financial support to funding themselves through jobs.</p><p>While studying, students are sending an average of $120 per month to their families in Uganda. This represents a 110% increase in the income of the remaining family members.</p><p>All but one current Malengo students expect to graduate within 4 years. (The remaining student had some bad luck in exams due to personal challenges, and we are currently filing a hardship application on his behalf, while simultaneously exploring other options with him, both for alternative courses of studies and vocational training in Germany.)</p><h2>Relationship with German Authorities and Universities</h2><p>An important ingredient in Malengo\u2019s success is a functional working relationship with the embassies that issue the student visas, and the universities where students study. On both fronts, we have had excellent experiences so far. The political backdrop is that Germany is urgently promoting immigration to combat its dramatic shortage of skilled labor, e.g. through the newly reformed Immigration Act for Skilled Workers (Fachkr\u00e4fteeinwanderungsgesetz, FEG). We have noticed this positive attitude towards immigration in a number of places:</p><ul><li>The German Embassy Kampala bent over backwards to make appointments available for the Malengo students. They went so far as to open 30 minutes early every day for several months to accommodate our students.</li><li>Before departing to Germany, Malengo\u2019s 2022 cohort received a send-off by the Vice Ambassador at a reception at the Embassy in Kampala (see picture).</li><li>The German Academic Exchange Service (DAAD) has taken an active and positive interest in Malengo. Early conversations with the East Africa Office in Nairobi were followed by a formal presentation of Malengo by Malengo\u2019s CEO Johannes Haushofer at DAAD in September 2023. The DAAD Lecturer at Makerere University, Rebekka Junker, spent an afternoon with the 2023 cohort at their orientation in Kampala to listen to their thoughts and answer questions about living and studying in Germany.</li></ul><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/bhktuqhwsrbwyteytyuw\" alt=\"Image\"><figcaption>The Malengo 2022 cohort at a reception at the German Embassy in Kampala, with Vice Ambassador Hans von Schroeder (left), August 2022</figcaption></figure><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/ofrmeecj4sxuauirmki1\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/ofrmeecj4sxuauirmki1 936w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/rcbz7zyuez1laess0maq 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/defkobm972nsnaqzs6az 768w\"><figcaption>The DAAD Lecturer at Makerere University, Ms. Rebekka Junker, with Malengo students of the 2023 cohort at orientation in Kampala, August 2023</figcaption></figure><h2>Philanthropic Support and Public Engagement</h2><p>We were fortunate to attract supporters and donors early on: In 2021 and 2022, we raised $1.3M in donations, and in 2023, $1M to date.

Incubator, and&nbsp;Malengo\u2019s Interim Strategy Director.</p><h2>Financing through Income Share Agreements</h2><p>To make the program sustainable, Malengo students enter into income share agreements (ISAs): once they earn a sufficiently high income, they are expected to contribute a percentage of their income back to the program for a specified period of time, and up to a specific maximum amount. In the 2023 cohort, students who later live in a high-income country and earn more EUR 27,000 per year are required to contribute 14% of their gross income for up to 10 years. Students who live in a low-income country and earn more than EUR 27,000 per year contribute 7% of their income for up to 5 years. The maximum lifetime repayment amount is capped at 2.5 times what students receive from the program. Students with incomes below the threshold are not required to make contributions, except for a EUR 10/month \u201cstay-in-touch\u201d payment for those living in high-income countries.</p><h2>Will the Income Share Agreements Work?</h2><p>Income share agreements are now a widely used and reliable instrument to enable students to fulfill their educational goals, while at the same time delivering returns to investors. For example, our partner organization Chancen eG operates the world\u2019s oldest ISA algorithm (25 years) with German private universities. Across both German and non-German students, Chancen eG assumes a default rate of less than 5% and has had zero defaults since expanding out of a single university in 2016. In fact, their program projects such reliable returns that they issue public bonds for their capitalization. Malengo\u2019s current model, with lower-cost public universities, does not require nearly the same repayment rates to deliver our estimated returns, but because we also operate in the German context, we will not be surprised by levels of repayment discipline and default that are better than our model\u2019s conservative assumptions.</p><p>Germany and the entire EU has an Open Banking regime, allowing easy access to students\u2019 financial information, and enabling direct withdrawals of ISA repayments from their bank accounts.</p><p>Enforcement of financial obligations in Germany is straightforward because each individual must be registered with local authorities at their place of residence and has a unique tax ID. Malengo\u2019s ISA contract was developed by the same law firm as that of Chancen eG. To determine repayments, students are contractually obligated to provide income statements and tax returns to Malengo. Repayments are automatically deducted from students\u2019 bank accounts. Current data from monthly stay-in-touch payments suggests high repayment discipline. As of July 2023, Malengo has 99% compliance on the monthly \u20ac10 payments that each student has to make.</p><p>As mentioned, current students have already found part-time jobs and are sending remittances home and all students currently expect to graduate within 4 years.</p><h2>Turning Malengo into an investment opportunity</h2><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:383px\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/lvviguhq7ilwhtsftdlo\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/lvviguhq7ilwhtsftdlo 768w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/nbzvyn504wenjn0uhnli 225w\"><figcaption>Malengo\u2019s first investor, <strong>Richard Nerland</strong>, and family</figcaption></figure><p>Malengo\u2019s 2023 cohort is the first to be financed by investment in the ISAs: we were fortunate to welcome Richard Nerland (picture) as our first investor. Together with him and law firms in Germany, the US, Uganda, and the UK, we developed a legal structure that allows individuals to invest into a special-purpose vehicle (SPV), which then makes the funds available to students as income share agreements. Once the students begin making repayments, these are sent directly back to the investor, minus administrative costs and fees for Malengo.</p><p>Richard invested <strong>$3.5M</strong> into this structure, allowing us to support the entire 2023 cohort, and some students from previous cohorts.</p><p>The 2024 cohort will be financed through the same investment opportunity. We regard this structure, which was conceived and developed together with Richard, as an important financial innovation. In contrast to debt, the investor earns a variable return that depends on the performance of the students; they carry the risk, but also earn any possible excess returns. Starting in 2025, we will also offer investors more complex modes of engagement, including participating with senior debt.</p><h2>Francophone Africa\u2013France Program</h2><p>This year, we are piloting a program that supports students from Francophone Africa who want to study in France. The reason to expand in this direction is that France has significant potential for Malengo\u2019s growth: in contrast to Germany, where we are limited to the (growing but still small) number of Bachelor\u2019s programs taught in English, we face no such limitation in France for students from Francophone Africa, where French is usually the language of instruction in secondary school.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:480px\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/y2yv2b7baonznbotxbqp\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/y2yv2b7baonznbotxbqp 518w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/dhiufkd6yxumpyrrpak8 300w\"><figcaption>Our two students from Madagascar on their way to France</figcaption></figure><p>We launched our Francophone program in April 2023. Because the application deadline for French universities for first-year students had already passed, we focused on students who had already applied, but did not yet have the means to fund their studies. We did not restrict the program to first-year students, but included those who applied to higher years and Master\u2019s degrees. We also took a less place-based approach for our Francophone program than for the Uganda\u2013Germany program: we advertised widely on social media throughout Francophone Africa, and received 80 applications from 14 countries. We made offers to 10 students from C\u00f4te d\u2019Ivoire, Republic of Congo, and Madagascar, of whom 9 accepted our offer. Our support consisted of assistance in applying for visas, finding housing, and financing of living expenses and travel costs. Our Francophone students also received financing through ISAs.</p><p>In developing these ISAs, because the students\u2019 needs were very heterogeneous, we offered customized, student-specific terms: the percentage of income that each student contributes after they reach the minimum income threshold, and the duration of contributions, is determined individually for each student depending on their year of study and chosen course.</p><p>As of September 2023, 8 students have reached France and are beginning their studies. One had their visa denied, so we\u2019ll try again next year.</p><h2>Expansion Plans for Higher Education</h2><p>European undergraduate programs provide a unique opportunity for scholars from low-income countries because tuition is either free or heavily subsidized. (For those who fear that using these opportunities is \u201ctaking advantage\u201d of the host countries, recall that <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13504851.2020.1855299\">the fiscal return to higher education is somewhere between 6\u201310%</a>.) The table below provides an overview of study opportunities in 14 European countries, sorted by how long we estimate it takes to earn back the costs of tuition and first-year living expenses. (The motivation for this choice of cost is that after the first year students can typically support their living expenses through part-time jobs.)</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/ybmynyasb5relrb522vu\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/cgdm1uo7bxks4jbarvwq 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/edwymcgtf7stezf1zkcb 200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/ckbofrtmbxsdclznx3qu 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/pvy75tiqrqhercj1pvn7 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/smyibuanzgddv0tg1bjy 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/bzjojankwfejc9nucyel 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/dndifgivlet2xessgjby 700w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/wdphvhdnnp9t4wxidq42 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/gnthfsygogkug6qfbc23 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/jsiltsjwrlcbblhetbaj 975w\"></figure><p>Malengo\u2019s scaling timeline is shown in the table below.

In 2024, we plan to add Belgium, followed by Austria, Italy, and Switzerland (2025); Portugal, Finland, Sweden, Netherlands (2026); Denmark, Spain, Ireland (2027); and Norway (2028). We project that the number of students can grow by a factor of about 2.9 each year.

However, those who qualify for the program necessarily have completed secondary school, which restricts the pool of people who can benefit from Malengo. To expand Malengo\u2019s reach, we will therefore pilot a <strong>vocational training program</strong> in 2024, in partnership with development economist Jakob Hennig and his non-profit organization, <strong>Deraja</strong>. We will focus on Kenya as an origin country, which has high rates of poverty and a large number of young people in urgent need of employment. The destination country is again Germany, which faces a significant shortage of skilled labor, and is urgently looking for high-skill immigration.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:407px\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/iqvdnevjr5qulxgxdrjh\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/iqvdnevjr5qulxgxdrjh 921w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/xt3jop6q638srnalsf4l 270w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/x4d9spkc7cfytlxocujr 768w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/abszzqebjxgxbdhhxtgt 1280w\"><figcaption><strong>Jakob Hennig, </strong>Founder and CEO, Deraja</figcaption></figure><p>In contrast to German universities, which offer numerous undergraduate degrees taught entirely in English, vocational training requires significant German skills already at the outset. For the purposes of the pilot program, we will therefore identify potential trainees who already have German skills, and coach them to obtain a trainee position with a German company. In the medium term, the program will begin with a <strong>year-long intensive German language course in the home country</strong>, followed by applications to German companies and the 2\u20133-year training in Germany. Similar to the higher education program, trainees receive a personal mentor who helps them through the application and visa process, and supports them in settling in in Germany. In contrast to students in higher education, vocational trainees receive a modest salary from their employer as soon as they begin training.</p><p>Financing is again through income share agreements, which cover the cost of the initial language training, the application process, and flight and visa costs. &nbsp;</p><h2>Ukraine Program</h2><p>When the war in&nbsp;Ukraine began, we quickly&nbsp;developed a program to allow displaced students to continue their studies in Germany. We had over 300 applications, and made offers of support to 30 students. We kept the number small because the \u201cimpact\u201d case for these students (who could afford to study at university without our help previously) is weaker than for those whom we normally support. Three students took up our offer and began studies in Germany. The reason for the&nbsp;small number of takers is likely that students were figuring themselves out and exploring many options.</p><h2>Research at Malengo</h2><p>We are dedicated to evidence, and to evaluating the impact of our program, not only on the lives of the students themselves, but also on their families and home communities. We have partnered with a world-class team of researchers who will study these important questions:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/hwpne7f0o78r0ad3nhpd\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/hwpne7f0o78r0ad3nhpd 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/d9dg2gm6b30bfthv1acz 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/mqos8w5sug5fvorrewcf 150w\"></p><p><strong>Toman Barsbai&nbsp;</strong><br>Associate Professor Economics, University of Bristol</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/r2gyf6xdyjq65ahpn7tz\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/r2gyf6xdyjq65ahpn7tz 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/mtuqednm5pwms0iwypwh 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/tfcm1fh5woh1cs0mxh5u 150w\"></p><p><strong>Merve Demirel</strong><br>PhD student in Economics, Stockholm University</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/exivfknlik67rpornv8a\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/exivfknlik67rpornv8a 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/mi1dt6jjmipifzph3pso 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/pjeyil5wqjui5zjtxvai 150w\"></p><p><strong>Emmanuel Nshakira Rukundo</strong><br>Senior Researcher, RWI Liebniz Institute for Economic Research</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/deyq4hdt0wg5gbwhfuj4\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/deyq4hdt0wg5gbwhfuj4 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/wbpoqe1evvzaqmnsj5pu 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/t8tkxamt4ukjghnll0sr 150w\"></p><p><strong>Marcello Perez Alvarez</strong><br>Assistant Professor of Development Economics, Groningen University</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/og0kqkcnuzhw4q5eilyn\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/og0kqkcnuzhw4q5eilyn 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/x4qxiurptovlkycshcfx 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/kwsskmw4ocxf4igoclnl 150w\"></p><p><strong>Matthias Sutter</strong><br>Director, Max Planck Institute Bonn, and Professor of Economics, University of Cologne</p><p>The research team has been successful in obtaining funding from EconTribute (\u20ac150,000), the Max Planck Society (\u20ac250,000), the World Bank ($280,000), and C-SEB ($15,000). They are currently conducting three studies:&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Randomized controlled trial of the&nbsp;Malengo&nbsp;program</u></strong>: This large-scale, multi-year study will evaluate the impacts of the program. Particular emphasis is placed on measuring not only economic impacts of the program, but psychosocial outcomes (e.g. life satisfaction); to measure not only direct effects, but also spillover effects, e.g. on the families of scholars and their home communities; and to measure not only positive impacts, but also potentially negative ones (e.g. possible experiences of discrimination or loneliness amongst the scholars; possible sadness about a far-away family member amongst parents and siblings). The study currently includes ~280 students (140 treatment, 140 control) and their families and home community members. Depending on the size of Cohort 4 (2023), the study may reach the required number of participants with that cohort.</p><p><strong><u>Representativeness study</u></strong>: This survey of 259 randomly selected Ugandan high school graduates and 387 randomly selected Ugandans asks how Malengo\u2019s applicants and scholars compare to other Ugandans. Analysis is ongoing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Encouragement study</u></strong>: In this study, the research team informed 3,607 current Ugandan high school students (and thousands of their non-surveyed classmates) in 188 schools about&nbsp;Malengo. 3,659 students in 189 schools serve as the control group. Early results suggest that learning about&nbsp;Malengo&nbsp;makes students see more benefits of and fewer obstacles to studying abroad; more willing to study and live abroad and more confident that they can realize these goals; more willing to obtain a university degree in general and prefer a later age at which to have their first child; and report higher levels of agency and higher learning support from parents and teachers. As a next step, we will test the impact of the intervention on grades in final high school exams.&nbsp;</p><h2>Failures</h2><p>We have had some painful failures as well. Here is a short overview:</p><h3>Funding</h3><ul><li>GiveWell, the Global Innovation Fund, and Schmidt Futures turned us down for funding after some conversation.&nbsp;We\u2019ve resumed some of these conversations this fall and hope for a better outcome.</li><li>We also received No\u2019s from the Agency Fund, Charity Entrepreneurship, Mulago Foundation (twice!), OpenPhilanthropy, UBS Optimus, MasterCard Foundation, and the FTX Future Fund (although the latter was perhaps a blessing).&nbsp;</li><li>We received $60,000 from FTX through a donor-advised fund (not the Future Fund) before it collapsed. After the collapse, we returned this money.</li><li>Research grant applications to Volkswagen Foundation, Riksbankens Jubileumsfond, STEG, the Spencer Foundation, and the NOMIS Foundation were also unsuccessful.&nbsp;A grant application to the Swedish Research Council failed when the Swedish government cancelled the funding round after the review process had begun.</li></ul><p>We\u2019ll re-apply to many of these opportunities in the coming year.</p><h3>Fraud case in 2022</h3><p>In recruiting&nbsp;Cohort 2 of the Uganda\u2013Germany program in 2022, we experienced an unfortunate incident: seven of our 30 admitted students got TOEFL scores that were too low for university admission,&nbsp;and subsequently either falsified or intended to falsify their scores to&nbsp;obtain admission anyway. This scheme was orchestrated by one of our students from Cohort 1. We found out because a university flagged irregularities. The financial damage was limited because these students had not left for Germany yet. We nevertheless responded strongly, expelling the seven students and the mastermind, and reporting the latter to the authorities. We also developed a code of conduct, which has been signed by all scholars and staff, and which will remain an integral part of our program and identity in the future.&nbsp;</p><h3>One student may not graduate</h3><p>In summer 2023, one of our students failed a class for the third time, upon which the university exmatriculated them. We have appealed this outcome because the student faced a difficult family situation at the time. But if the appeal fails, it is likely that this student will not graduate from their originally chosen course. If this happens, we will continue to support them in either finding a new degree course to study, or switching to vocational training.</p><h2>Staff Growth</h2><p>We have also been fortunate to attract a number of high-caliber <strong>full-time staff</strong> to Malengo over the past year:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/x3n71vqu7oojfesyghis\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/x3n71vqu7oojfesyghis 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/pwclwihsl1xe6jgzbfy5 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/haDk7Nknb4RmkBXNa/pd6ncn7rg6tyl90pfffu 150w\"></p><figure class=\"table\" style=\"width:640px\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:0.75em\"><strong>Stephen Mangira</strong> joined us as the Senior Program Manager for Africa.

These are cheap and highly effective treatments for one of the leading causes of death globally in young children: diarrhea. We are building partnerships with community health worker (CHW) networks to provide free, pre-emptive home delivery to households with young children. We will help CHWs provide ORS and zinc, guide caregivers, and conduct monitoring to ensure effective rollout.</p><p><strong>Background of the intervention </strong>ORS and zinc are not new, but usage remains tragically low in some populations, meaning a missed opportunity to address nearly 500,000 deaths of children under five years old each year. Improvements in delivery and health education strategies are needed to drive up stagnating usage rates. We decided on the model of provision of free pre-emptive delivery by CHWs based on high-quality evidence, including a randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Uganda (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6345441/\"><u>Wagner et al., 2019</u></a>), in which free and convenient (home-delivered) ORS and zinc provision increased usage by more than 30% when compared to the standard access.</p><p><strong>Near-term plans </strong>We are planning visits to the two or three countries we prioritized based on disease burden, ORS and zinc usage rates, and tractability factors: Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Madagascar. During these, we seek to deepen our familiarity with the context of caregivers and CHWs and establish partnerships with governmental and local non-profit organizations. We are still growing our networks in these countries, so if readers would like to help and are involved with non-profits or healthcare in Nigeria, Ethiopia, or Madagascar, please email us.</p><h3><br><strong>LAFIYA NIGERIA</strong></h3><p><img style=\"width:740px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/pKDob5yXh2djqdgcP/ctunq6h50es7vv3ywoqg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>Co-founders</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/klauchmielowska/\"><u>Klau Chmielowska</u></a><u>,</u> <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/cdkamsteeg/\"><u>C\u00e9line Kamsteeg</u></a>&nbsp;<br><strong>Website:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.lafiyanigeria.org/\"><u>www.lafiyanigeria.org</u></a><br><strong>Email address: </strong><a href=\"mailto:info@lafiyanigeria.org\"><u>info@lafiyanigeria.org</u></a><br><strong>CE Incubation Grant: </strong>$185,000<br><br><strong>Description of the intervention</strong><br>Lafiya Nigeria enables access to safe family planning in Nigeria through a direct distribution model.<strong> </strong>We procure an innovative, cost-effective, and self-injectable contraceptive called \u2018Sayana Press\u2019 (or DMPA-SC), which provides contraceptive cover for three months from a single injection. We upskill Lafiya Sisters, locally employed nurses and midwives, with additional family planning training. Lafiya Sisters provide family planning counseling and distribute the Sayana Press free of charge to women with an unmet need for family planning.</p><p><strong>Background of the intervention</strong><br>In many low and middle-income countries, giving birth is one of the most dangerous actions a woman can take. In Nigeria, over 45% of women who want contraception do not have access to a method \u2013 this lack of response to the unmet need results in over three million unintended pregnancies annually. Due to high fertility rates, low contraceptive uptake, and poor healthcare services, over 40,000 women in Nigeria die each year from preventable pregnancy-related issues. We believe this number should be zero.</p><p><strong>Near-term plans</strong><br>With the CE incubation grant, our near-term aims are across three areas: 1) Scale our existing operations: within six months, we will commence operations in a third Nigerian state, as well as broaden our existing reach in Kebbi and Jigawa states; 2) Conduct external impact evaluation: based on promising pilot results from the past two years, we aim to robustly evaluate our impact, eventually leading to an RCT within two years; 3) Increasing partnerships: we aim to increase our visibility with state and federal governments. This is already bearing fruit, as the Federal Ministry of Health recently invited us to its quarterly Family Planning Technical Working Group, where we were able to contribute to national strategy around family planning.</p><h3><br><strong>ALLIANCE FOR REDUCING MICROBIAL RESISTANCE</strong></h3><p><img style=\"width:740px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/pKDob5yXh2djqdgcP/ehwygjnxvyxispcfbqtu\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>Co-founders</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/aanika-dalal-82905a18a/\"><u>Aanika Dalal</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/david-mckinney1/\"><u>David McKinney</u></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sofya-lebedeva-129859145/\"><u>Sofya Lebedeva</u></a><br><strong>Website: </strong><a href=\"https://www.armoramr.org/\"><u>https://www.armoramr.org</u></a>&nbsp;<br><strong>Email address: </strong><a href=\"mailto:hello@armoramr.org\"><u>hello@armoramr.org</u></a><br><strong>CE Incubation Grant: </strong>$155,000</p><p><strong>Description of the intervention</strong><br>ARMoR is an evidence-led non-profit organization combating the growing threat of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR). We perform research and advocacy supporting innovative policy initiatives, with a primary focus on market shaping \u201cpull incentives,\u201d aiming to foster the development of new, high-value antimicrobials and ensure fair access for those with the greatest need.</p><p><strong>Background of the intervention</strong><br>Antimicrobials are medicines that kill or prevent the spread of microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, fungi, and parasites. Because of antimicrobials, many of us are no longer at risk from dangerous infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, sepsis, and meningitis. Over time, as we use these drugs to combat infections, the microorganisms we target evolve and develop resistance to our treatments, rendering them ineffective, a phenomenon known as AMR.</p><p>At least 1.27 million deaths and 47 million DALYs are directly attributed to bacterial AMR each year, surpassing the toll of malaria and HIV. This number is rising at an alarming rate, and some studies have estimated that, without serious intervention, antimicrobial resistance could overtake cancer as a cause of death by 2050, with 10+ million fatalities each year.</p><p><strong>Near-term plans</strong><br>Our initial advocacy efforts will be focused on the Netherlands and Germany (though this is still tentative as we conduct a more in-depth analysis). In the upcoming quarter, we plan to:</p><ul><li>Conduct an in-depth stakeholder analysis of our target countries to identify the most promising opportunities for advocacy.</li><li>Research and write up an initial policy brief.</li><li>Build up a network in target countries and the AMR space.</li><li>Conduct and publish a survey of major pharmaceutical companies.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><h3><strong>CONCENTRIC POLICIES</strong></h3><p><img style=\"width:740px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/pKDob5yXh2djqdgcP/x1szaih1pian4tgtbtfz\" alt=\"\"></p><p><strong>Co-founders</strong>: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sam-emerman/\"><u>Sam Emerman</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jtstanley/\"><u>J.T.

We conduct research and advocacy to expand the adoption of evidence-based health policies across low- and middle-income countries. Through collaboration with governments, civil societies, and citizens, we aim to reduce the unhealthy consumption of tobacco, sugar, sodium, and alcohol.</p><p><strong>Background of the intervention</strong><br>NCDs cause 74% of all deaths globally, 17 million prematurely. The WHO has produced comprehensive action plans to reduce the health burden from four key disease areas: cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and chronic respiratory disease. Although there are several solutions with robust bodies of evidence, most countries do not fully meet WHO guidelines. Some of the highest-impact policy recommendations for NCDs include higher taxation on tobacco, alcohol, and sugar-sweetened beverages and reformulating food products to contain less salt.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Near-term plans</strong><br>Concentric Policies will initially focus on tobacco control. Our plan for the remainder of 2023 centers around country selection, building technical capacity, and establishing partnerships with NGOs and civil society. We will continue to combine desk research with expert opinions to narrow down our shortlist of potential pilot countries. We aim to conduct one or two country scoping visits by the end of the quarter.</p>", "user": {"username": "CE"}}, {"_id": "iHMiidnaJW5GCDpTH", "title": "Want to work in the US?

And that\u2019s not looking to change anytime soon.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Right. Yeah, I am always surprised, when I learn more about the statistics, to learn that it seems like animal agriculture is just this horrible, horrible thing \u2014 that whatever problem you look at, it\u2019s there, making things much worse, and is a pretty big share of many of these problems. Like climate change: it feels like less of a secret or unknown fact now, but I feel like a few years ago I learned about the share of carbon emissions that come from animal agriculture, and <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/greenhouse-gas-emissions-food\">it\u2019s just huge</a>. It\u2019s one of the main things \u2014 it\u2019s not like a little side thing; it\u2019s like a key thing \u2014 which I found kind of mind-blowing. And it seems like that\u2019s the case for loads of issues, including animal welfare, which I care a lot about personally.</p><p><strong>Seren Kell:</strong> Yeah. On that climate point, <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aba7357\">one study</a> found that if we literally eliminated fossil fuels overnight, we still couldn\u2019t meet our <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paris_Agreement\">Paris Agreement</a> targets unless we addressed animal agriculture globally. And this is really the untapped source of emissions \u2014 which, as you referenced, gets far less attention.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> I guess we agree that animal agriculture causes lots of harm, so why work on alternative proteins as opposed to other interventions?</p><p><strong>Seren Kell:</strong> Our thinking behind this essentially is that we haven\u2019t been very successful historically in addressing this problem through basically telling people what to eat or asking people to reduce their meat consumption. And if we look at what actually drives consumer decision making around what they choose to buy and eat, it is, for the vast majority of people: taste, price, and accessibility. It just isn\u2019t concerns around health or climate change. Those things are accessory factors, which might nudge people if taste, price, and convenience are already being met, but most people are not compromising on those first three. And unfortunately, it just is the case that alternatives to meat right now, for the vast majority of people, are not quite there yet on those three metrics.</p><p>So I think with that being true, we need to provide something which people actually want to eat, but is far more sustainable and far more humane. And that really is the driving theory behind alternative proteins. I think alternative proteins as an intervention into reducing the harms associated with animal agriculture, it\u2019s not a silver bullet. I think there are complementary approaches; I won\u2019t speak to various interventions specifically targeting things like animal welfare or specifically targeting the usage of antibiotics. I think alternative proteins has an advantage, where you\u2019re just essentially trying to displace the problem that is the cause of all of these issues, and therefore it seems a lot more scalable than other interventions. But that\u2019s not to say that I think it\u2019s one or the other.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>How fermentation is used in alternative proteins</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Seren Kell:</strong> So fermentation has been an incredibly useful method of processing and preserving food for literally thousands of years. So beer, bread, tempeh, sauerkraut, kimchi, et cetera: those all involve traditional fermentation. And now we are seeing scientists and companies applying both traditional fermentation to alternative proteins specifically, but also other ways of using microorganisms which fall under this bucket of fermentation: biomass and precision fermentation. That can be to produce very specific functional ingredients \u2014 things like fats or flavour molecules or vitamins \u2014 but also to produce actual meaty protein itself that has the same taste and texture of animal products.</p><p>One way in which it\u2019s helpful is that it can essentially improve the taste of plant-based ingredients. To give a specific example of this: if you\u2019re using legumes \u2014 for example, peas \u2014 as your plant-based ingredient, it can often have this kind of beany taste, this kind of strange, odd taste associated with it. That\u2019s one way in which fermentation can come in handy. So if you ferment, let\u2019s say, fava beans, that can reduce that beany taste. And that\u2019s actually what one food manufacturer, <a href=\"https://fabea.foodiq.fi/\">Foodiq</a>, have done. They\u2019ve launched this fermented fava bean ingredient where they\u2019ve used fermentation.</p><p>Here\u2019s another example: <a href=\"https://www.mycoiq.com/\">MycoTechnology</a> is a company that is performing traditional fermentation of things like pea or rice or chickpea. And again, because they fermented it with a particular fungus, that\u2019s now really improved the taste profile and added tastes like meatiness and savoriness and certain umami flavours to the product.</p><p>Biomass fermentation is a similar concept: you\u2019re feeding microorganisms whatever they need to grow. But rather than the main biomass being the plant ingredient, it\u2019s the actual microorganism. So you\u2019re essentially just leveraging the fact that they can grow incredibly quickly and produce a lot of high-quality protein very quickly, and actually consuming them directly.</p><p>There\u2019s some pretty impressive examples of this. There\u2019s another biomass fermentation company called <a href=\"https://www.enough-food.com/\">ENOUGH Food</a>, and with a factory that they\u2019re currently building in the Netherlands, they\u2019re aiming to deliver 50,000 tonnes per year \u2014 which is the equivalent of about a cow\u2019s worth of protein every two minutes, which is very cool.</p><p>Another one that jumps to mind is a company in Finland called <a href=\"https://solarfoods.com/\">Solar Foods</a>. They\u2019re essentially using electricity, air, and water as the inputs to then produce a load of high-quality protein.</p><p>Precision fermentation is really interesting. Again, you\u2019re using microorganisms, but you\u2019re using them essentially as miniature cell factories to produce very specific ingredients. And this is not at all unique to alternative proteins. Just to give a couple of examples of this, a while ago, most people got their insulin from the pig industry; it was extracted from pigs. That is no longer the case. The vast majority of insulin that diabetics use is produced via essentially this process. So they\u2019ve taken a yeast, given it the instructions it needs to produce human insulin, and then they are growing in a tank, producing lots of the insulin, and then the insulin is purified out. It is clean, it does not have to come from a pig slaughterhouse, and it\u2019s a much more reliable process.</p><p>There have been a few really exciting examples of this. First of all, <a href=\"https://impossiblefoods.com/\">Impossible Foods</a> essentially pioneered precision fermentation and produced <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heme\">heme</a>. Heme is an ingredient which is naturally present in animal tissue. It\u2019s in your blood and my blood. And they\u2019ve essentially taken the instructions for producing heme and are expressing it through precision fermentation, and then using that as an ingredient in a plant-based burger. So it\u2019s the reason that the Impossible Burger kind of bleeds and has this kind of bloody look, and it\u2019s supposed to be responsible for that meaty taste that you have with the Impossible Burger.</p><p>Because you have total freedom to decide which proteins or which fats or which particular ingredients you want to make, you can also just make real animal proteins. To give an example of this, we\u2019re seeing some companies taking yeast and giving them the instructions to make things like whey or casein \u2014 which are the major proteins in cow\u2019s milk \u2014 and then using that to produce genuinely real animal-free dairy: ice cream or yoghurt or cheeses, things like that.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>What makes fermentation so exciting</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Seren Kell:</strong> If you just do a standard <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life-cycle_assessment\">life cycle assessment</a> of fermentation as a process, you do have massive savings in terms of land use and greenhouse gas emissions and water usage and other metrics that are important for <a href=\"https://gfi.org/initiatives/climate/\">environmental impact</a>.</p><p>Just to give a couple of examples of this: Quorn\u2019s fermentation-made protein has a <a href=\"https://www.quornnutrition.com/health-topics/sustainable-nutrition\">carbon footprint 70% lower than chicken</a>. And I should say that chickens are a hard benchmark, because chickens are incredibly efficient from an environmental perspective, compared with beef, say.</p><p>If you do a like-for-like comparison with beef, your savings are obviously going to be a lot better than compared with chicken. So if you produce whey protein via precision fermentation, that causes 97% fewer greenhouse gas emissions than if you\u2019re taking it from a cow directly. That\u2019s <a href=\"https://perfectday.com/blog/life-cycle-assessment-of-perfect-day-protein/\">another life cycle assessment</a> that\u2019s been done of a particular product.</p><p>But I think it is worth talking about the fact that not only is fermentation just less resource intensive overall, but back to that point about being able to upcycle waste side streams from other industries. There is this big opportunity for broader sustainability benefits there.</p><p>So I can just give a couple examples of what that could look like in practice. For example, there\u2019s a German fermentation startup called <a href=\"https://www.mushlabs.com/\">Mushlabs</a> that is collaborating with a brewery to use essentially spent grain from the beer production process as the food that they then feed to their mycoprotein.</p><p><strong>Seren Kell:</strong> Yeah, it\u2019s really cool. We\u2019ve actually funded a project through our <a href=\"https://gfi.org/researchgrants/\">Research Grant Program</a> where researchers are taking corn husks, which again is another waste agricultural byproduct \u2014 and again using that as a potential feedstock or food for their microorganisms to consume, and just getting high-quality protein at the end of that process. And there\u2019s a bunch more research that can be done. Oyster mushrooms, <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12649-020-01311-y\">one paper suggested recently</a>, could grow on just hydrated wood pulp, which is an incredibly abundant side stream from the paper industry. So there\u2019s just a lot of opportunities there.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Your Quorn chicken nuggets come from a shed</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> So another challenge is trying to figure out which microbial strains to use for fermentation, which I think basically is like, Do you use a particular kind of yeast? Do you use bacteria? Do you use some specific cell line? Can you explain what the challenge is there?</p><p><strong>Seren Kell:</strong> Yeah, so it is exactly as you said: it\u2019s which organism are you using as your production host in your process? One way of looking at it is precision fermentation isn\u2019t really a new technique. In other industries it might go by different names, like \u201crecombinant protein production\u201d or \u201csynthetic biology,\u201d but it\u2019s an established technology. And there are a bunch of what are called \u201cworkhorse strains\u201d: go-to production hosts that are used. There\u2019s reasons why people would start to converge on using similar strains: they start to become more familiar; people start to characterise them better; there\u2019s fewer regulatory barriers because it\u2019s just well understood, whereas there are barriers to commercialising new host species.</p><p>But there basically is no reason why, from a scientific perspective, we should be limited to a very small number of strains which are well characterised by other industries. We\u2019ve slightly hit diminishing returns in terms of how much better we can make those strains. And it would just make a lot more sense to go out there and explore the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, if not more, strains that we may not even have discovered, but still could go out and find out what they\u2019re doing and just leverage whatever biodiversity they actually have. And again, now that we have these high-throughput screening and characterisation tools, it does actually really merit essentially just recanvassing all of the known microbial species to see what their suitability would look like for this application.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Cool. I\u2019m realising I kind of have a sense of what you mean by \u201chigh-throughput\u201d: I think you mean something like you can do a thing computationally to do it really quickly and efficiently, and get loads of results about which strains or which targets seem good. Is it something like that?</p><p><strong>Seren Kell:</strong> That\u2019s exactly right. You\u2019re predefining the kinds of things that you think might be useful traits about what you\u2019re looking for. So whether that\u2019s the actual strain, the host organism, or whether that\u2019s the target molecule or ingredient that you want to be producing, and then you are screening all of the data we have already \u2014 and that might be things like the genomes, the metabolisms, the known signalling pathways \u2014 within what is known of these existing microbial species out there, and seeing what comes back. So, yeah, it\u2019s basically like comparing and contrasting different traits really quickly using computational data.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> So it sounds like the challenge here, which I guess is also just an opportunity, is that there are probably billions of bacteria, fungi, yeast out in the world, and we can just look at all of them and be like, \u201cAre any of these creating the kinds of things we need to make alternative proteins taste better or make an ingredient more cheaply?\u201d So let\u2019s just explore them all and find the best ones. Which is just pretty amazing.</p><p><strong>Seren Kell:</strong> There\u2019s a couple of nice examples here actually. One kind of fun example of this is actually the story of Quorn, the mycoprotein that is used in the Quorn company\u2019s products. Essentially in, I believe it was the \u201970s, they were like, \u201cLet\u2019s go and find some fungal strain that we might be able to use as a food source.\u201d And they went out and did one of these screening approaches to go and test in different environments: Can we find a cool fungus that might be able to grow, and might have really great nutrition, and grow relatively efficiently high-protein content, and all the rest of it? And the final strain \u2014 the fusarium strain that was ultimately used, and then was selected and improved upon \u2014 I think it was found at the bottom of the garden in a shed of one of the researchers who went out and did this. And that was almost half a century ago, if I\u2019m getting the dates right. And that is the strain that Quorn uses.</p><p>Who\u2019s to say there aren\u2019t many others, and many better ones out there that we just haven\u2019t discovered yet in biology? And fungi especially are just amazing and can be very well adapted to quite extreme environments. There are certain microorganisms that live at the bottom of the sea and so can deal with really high temperatures, or can consume as their food quite strange sources. They can be very flexible, which means we could feed this thing methanol or hydrogen or carbon dioxide, and it will just turn that into protein because \u2014 through totally independent evolution elsewhere \u2014 it\u2019s evolved to just do some really cool chemistry.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>The path to affordable cultivated meat</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Seren Kell:</strong> The <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11367-022-02128-8\">techno-economic assessment</a> that I mentioned from CE Delft did identify that if there were the right public investment going into the sector and solving some of those technical challenges around reducing media costs and things like that, it showed that it could be possible to bring cultivated meat production costs down to about \u20ac4.68 per kilo by the year 2030.</p><p>It shows that there is a pathway to get there, but it is contingent on this big \u201cif\u201d of public investment. If you look at where <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/solar-pv-prices\">solar panels</a> were in the 1990s, it exists, and for the sector more generally, they were available for very eco-conscious customers who are willing to pay a premium. But until there is significant public investment going into scaling up and solving some of those technical challenges, you won\u2019t be able to have something which is genuinely accessible to most consumers and therefore making it a real displacement of the actual market.</p><p>Right now we have a roadmap for what making progress would look like, and what addressing the current uncertainty would look like. So we know enough to know that it is absolutely worth pursuing, and to know the scale of investment that needs to go in to pursue it. And we know enough to know that it\u2019s not a writeoff entirely as a technology. But yeah, there is just a lot of uncertainty as to how to get there, and how to get that support from governments to get the sector there.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> How much funding do governments need to commit in order to get that research done?</p><p><strong>Seren Kell:</strong> One <a href=\"https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/report/what-gets-measured-gets-financed-climate-finance-funding-flows-and-opportunities/\">report</a> from the Rockefeller Foundation and BCG estimated that every single year, alternative proteins have an unmet funding need of around $40 billion. I think if you look at R&amp;D budgets for companies, $40 billion at a global scale is actually a drop in the water compared to what is spent on other technologies.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Got it. So we need people on the policy side convincing governments that that is a commitment they should be making.</p><p><strong>Seren Kell:</strong> Yes. And I should say, crucially, there needs to be much more research funding going into the space, but there is also a very important role of scientists in continuing to flesh out and detail that roadmap for what the highest priority research areas and most promising avenues are to be going down. So we certainly need far more scientists moving into that space as well, but that is a function of research funding, and scientists don\u2019t do research if there isn\u2019t funding to pay for it.</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "80000_Hours"}}, {"_id": "JMhwY2WE3oqkRxf6h", "title": "Metaculus Launches Conditional Cup to Explore Linked Forecasts", "postedAt": "2023-10-18T20:41:40.542Z", "htmlBody": "<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JMhwY2WE3oqkRxf6h/loskhpqtwpfxd7tndpaz\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JMhwY2WE3oqkRxf6h/mw06mybrxctphesctduy 160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JMhwY2WE3oqkRxf6h/q5bih3jt3fihwc9hpwkg 320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JMhwY2WE3oqkRxf6h/wjcd3obwfdgq8b3yeofv 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JMhwY2WE3oqkRxf6h/k7wxnya0tq2dcnt3xkfj 640w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JMhwY2WE3oqkRxf6h/skjsi9aujycnoxjqsuyi 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JMhwY2WE3oqkRxf6h/o21usgu6efrazkqmdh3h 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JMhwY2WE3oqkRxf6h/ftmzndzabuzqckdyumpc 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JMhwY2WE3oqkRxf6h/qtlhrz7ycujcsgkgavu7 1280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JMhwY2WE3oqkRxf6h/owlxe0rfsklxssk76tbz 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/JMhwY2WE3oqkRxf6h/erlgegnsmdtgnehtmuhq 1536w\"></p><p>Game out scenarios and bring greater clarity to the relationships between important events in Metaculus's new <a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/tournament/2503/\">Conditional Cup</a>.

They\u2019ve regulated <a href=\"https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/translation-internet-information-service-algorithmic-recommendation-management-provisions-effective-march-1-2022/\">recommendation algorithms</a> and taken steps to mitigate the risk of <a href=\"https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/translation-internet-information-service-deep-synthesis-management-provisions-draft-for-comment-jan-2022/\">deepfakes</a>. Most recently, they issued a new law governing <a href=\"https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/generative-ai-interim/\">generative AI</a>. It\u2019s less stringent than <a href=\"https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/comparison-chart-of-current-vs-draft-rules-for-generative-ai/\">earlier draft version</a>, but the law remains more comprehensive in AI regulation than any laws passed in the US, UK, or European Union.&nbsp;</p><p>The law creates legal obligations for AI providers to respect intellectual property rights, avoid discrimination, and uphold socialist values. But as with many AI policy proposals, these are values and ideals, and it\u2019s not entirely clear how AI providers can meet these obligations.&nbsp;</p><p>To clarify how AI providers can achieve the law's goals, a Chinese standards-setting body has released a draft outlining <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mattsheehan88/status/1714001598383317459?s=46\">detailed technical requirements</a>. Here are some of the key details:</p><ul><li>AI companies must randomly sample their training data and verify that at least 96% of data points are acceptable under the law.&nbsp;</li><li>After passing this first test, the training data must then be filtered to remove remaining content that violates intellectual property protections, censorship laws, and other obligations.&nbsp;</li><li>Once the model has been trained, the provider must red-team it in order to identify misbehavior. Providers must create thousands of questions with which to test the model. The model should refuse to answer at least 95% of questions that would violate the law, while answering at least 95% of questions that are not illegal.&nbsp;</li><li>Finally, the model\u2019s answers to a set of questions about sensitive topics including personal information, discrimination, and socialist values must be acceptable in at least 90% of cases.</li></ul><p>Other countries might be able to learn from this example of technically rigorous governance. For example, the US <a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/ostp/ai-bill-of-rights/\">AI Bill of Rights</a> supports goals for AI systems such as \u201csafety\u201d and \u201cprivacy,\u201d but it\u2019s not exactly clear what this would mean in practice. Effective AI governance will require governments to build expertise and engage in the technical details of AI systems.</p><p><strong>United States tightens export controls on chips. </strong>Last October, the United States issued <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/07/business/economy/biden-chip-technology.html\">export controls</a> on high performance computer chips to Chinese individuals, firms, and government actors. American chip designer Nvidia promptly created new chips which <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/nvidia-tweaks-flagship-h100-chip-export-china-h800-2023-03-21/\">skirted just under the rule\u2019s limits</a>, and sold <a href=\"https://www.tomshardware.com/news/chinese-companies-spend-big-on-nvidia-gpus-for-ai-projects\">$5 billion</a> of these chips to Chinese companies.&nbsp;</p><p>The US has now <a href=\"https://www.bis.doc.gov/index.php/about-bis/newsroom/2082\">updated its rules</a> to close this loophole. Previously, chips faced export controls if they exceeded limits on both computational performance and the speed of communication with other chips. The new rules eliminate that second criteria, meaning that regardless of their communication speed, computer chips with high computational performance will face restrictions.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb37ec8-f02c-40ff-b888-d2d9b37cb457_1480x708.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb37ec8-f02c-40ff-b888-d2d9b37cb457_1480x708.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb37ec8-f02c-40ff-b888-d2d9b37cb457_1480x708.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb37ec8-f02c-40ff-b888-d2d9b37cb457_1480x708.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffcb37ec8-f02c-40ff-b888-d2d9b37cb457_1480x708.png 1456w\"><figcaption><i>The revised US export controls apply to all chips with high computational performance, regardless of communication speed (\u201cinterconnect bandwidth\u201d). </i><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ohlennart/status/1714319096035119228\"><i>Illustration</i></a><i> by Lennart Heim.</i></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Kissinger urges cooperation between the U.S. and China on AI. </strong>In a new <a href=\"https://www.foreignaffairs.com/united-states/henry-kissinger-path-artificial-intelligence-arms-control\">article</a> titled, \u201cThe Path to AI Arms Control: America and China Must Work Together to Avert Catastrophe,\u201d former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and Harvard professor Graham Allison said the following:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cWe have concluded that the prospects that the unconstrained advance of AI will create catastrophic consequences for the United States and the world are so compelling that leaders in governments must act now.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>The article draws an analogy to nuclear arms control agreements between the United States and the Soviet Union, saying \u201cboth Washington and Moscow recognized that if nuclear technology fell into the hands of rogue actors or terrorists within their own borders, it could be used to threaten them.\u201d This recognition of collective risks allowed several agreements on nuclear arms control which improved the security of both nations.</p><p>They called on US President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping to have a private, face-to-face discussion about AI risks, the steps their governments are taking to mitigate them, and opportunities for bilateral cooperation on AI safety. After this private discussion, they recommend creating \u201can advisory group consisting of US and Chinese AI scientists\u201d to hold an ongoing discussion about AI risks and potential areas for cooperation. The article also voices support for creating an IAEA for AI that could enforce international safety standards.&nbsp;</p><h2>Proposed International Institutions for AI</h2><p>Last month, the Legal Priorities Project released <a href=\"https://www.legalpriorities.org/research/international-ai-institutions.html\">a report</a> reviewing various proposals for international AI institutions. Here, we summarize and discuss the report.</p><p>The report breaks down proposals for new international AI institutions into seven models:</p><ol><li><strong>Scientific consensus-building. </strong>An international institution might establish scientific consensus on policy-relevant AI-related questions. For example, it might follow the model of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). This proposal has been criticized on the grounds that, in contrast to AI, climate change was well-understood before the creation of the IPCC.</li><li><strong>Political consensus-building and norm-setting. </strong>An international institution might foster political consensus. Again, using climate as an example, it might follow the model of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. A challenge this proposal faces is balancing between breadth of membership and depth of alignment between members.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Coordination of policy and regulation. </strong>An international institution might coordinate national policies towards common AI-related goals. It might require states to adhere to regulations of AI development and deployment, following the model of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which regulates international trade.</li><li><strong>Enforcement of standards or restrictions. </strong>Rather than set regulation, an international might also enforce regulation. For example, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is tasked with deterring nuclear proliferation by monitoring national nuclear energy programs for misuse. An \u201cIAEA for AI\u201d is a popular proposal; however, it\u2019s not clear whether safeguarding AI is sufficiently analogous to safeguarding nuclear energy to justify a focus on the IAEA.</li><li><strong>Stabilization and emergency response. </strong>Some international institutions are designed to prepare for and respond to emergencies, such as the United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR). However, in order to be relevant to AI risk, such a model would likely have to focus on preventing (rather than responding to) disasters.</li><li><strong>International joint research. </strong>An international institution might organize and undertake a major research project. For example, it might follow the model of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN). Proposals often suggest that such an institution accelerate AI safety research.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Distribution of benefits and access. </strong>Finally, an institution might provide conditional access to the benefits of AI, following, for example, the model of the IAEA\u2019s nuclear fuel bank. Such an institution would have to balance the risk of proliferation of a risky technology with the benefit of equitable access.</li></ol><p>History offers many lessons from previous efforts to govern emerging technologies and solve global coordination problems. Of course, we cannot merely mimic historical efforts. International cooperation to mitigate the risks of AI development will require creating new solutions.&nbsp;</p><h2>Open Source AI: Risks and Opportunities</h2><p>When Meta released their open source language model, Llama, they <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13971\">wrote extensively</a> about their efforts to make the model safe. They evaluated risks of bias and misinformation, and took steps to mitigate these risks. But then they open-sourced the model, allowing anybody to change the model however they like. Can an open source model remain safe?&nbsp;</p><p>No, according to a new <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03693\">paper</a>. It shows that open source models which were designed to act safely can easily be fine-tuned to behave harmfully. They train Llama to produce harmful outputs, such as step-by-step advice on how to build chemical weapons.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66920f6c-430b-48af-a0f6-7962425e813b_1452x344.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66920f6c-430b-48af-a0f6-7962425e813b_1452x344.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66920f6c-430b-48af-a0f6-7962425e813b_1452x344.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66920f6c-430b-48af-a0f6-7962425e813b_1452x344.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F66920f6c-430b-48af-a0f6-7962425e813b_1452x344.png 1456w\"><figcaption><i>Fine-tuning can cause an AI system to behave harmfully. </i><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.03693\"><i>Source</i></a><i>.&nbsp;</i></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Even without open source, AI models can be made to misbehave. </strong>Models which are open-sourced can be made to misbehave if the AI provider allows users to fine-tune the model. OpenAI initially did not allow fine-tuning for GPT-3.5, but since the release of Llama, they have begun to offer it. The paper shows that fine-tuning GPT-3.5 can bypass its safeguards and quickly cause harmful behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, without any fine-tuning access whatsoever, previous <a href=\"https://newsletter.safe.ai/p/ai-safety-newsletter-17\">research</a> has shown that jailbreak prompts and adversarial attacks can cause a supposedly safe AI system to misbehave.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How does AI affect the offense-defense balance? </strong>Just as AI will allow malicious actors to cause harm, it will enable stronger defenses against those attacks. But an important question is whether AI changes the offense-defense balance: Will it bring more benefit to attackers or defenders?&nbsp;</p><p>In traditional software, open source typically favors defenders. If a bug or security vulnerability in the code is revealed, an attacker might try to exploit it. But because developers can quickly fix these flaws once they\u2019ve been revealed, overall the security of an open source system is often stronger.&nbsp;</p><p>The concern with AI is different. Attackers are not trying to find vulnerabilities in AI systems. Instead, AI can be used to exploit societal vulnerabilities that are not easy to fix. For example, a chatbot could help someone build a biological weapon that causes a pandemic. We might use AI to develop vaccines and track the disease\u2019s spread. But many people might refuse a vaccine, and even with a rapid response, millions could die. In this scenario, AI provides an asymmetric benefit to attackers seeking to cause pandemics, without an equal corresponding benefit to defenders.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Legislation considers the risks of open source AI. </strong>The US, UK, and EU are working to lay the legislative foundation for AI. The UK\u2019s Competition and Market Authority appears to <a href=\"https://time.com/6316336/uk-ai-regulation-competition/\">support open-source AI</a> because the open-source models promote competition, while <a href=\"https://dd80b675424c132b90b3-e48385e382d2e5d17821a5e1d8e4c86b.ssl.cf1.rackcdn.com/external/09072023bipartisanaiframework.pdf\">licensing requirements</a> recommended by US Senators Richard Blumenthal and Josh Hawley would likely slow down the open-source release of highly-capable models. The EU is currently reconciling three drafts of its <a href=\"https://hai.stanford.edu/news/analyzing-european-union-ai-act-what-works-what-needs-improvement\">AI Act</a>, each of which propose different ways to govern open-source AI.&nbsp;</p><h2>Links</h2><ul><li>Drones in Ukraine may be <a href=\"https://www.newscientist.com/article/2397389-ukrainian-ai-attack-drones-may-be-killing-without-human-oversight/\">killing people without human oversight</a>.</li><li>A new investigation of <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2977-1.html\">biological weapons risks from AI systems</a> is ongoing.</li><li>The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/DanHendrycks/status/1651740865159901184\">effective accelerationists</a> have a new <a href=\"https://a16z.com/the-techno-optimist-manifesto/\">manifesto</a>.</li><li>The UK releases the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-safety-summit-programme/ai-safety-summit-day-1-and-2-programme\">agenda for the AI Safety Summit</a>.</li><li>SEC chairperson urges lawmakers to <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8227636f-e819-443a-aeba-c8237f0ec1ac\">protect the financial system</a> from AI risks.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/articles/googles-wartime-urgency-to-chase-chatgpt-shakes-up-culture\">Competitive pressures</a> have led Google to hasten their language model development.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-06/g-7-plans-to-ask-ai-makers-to-agree-to-watermarks-audits\">G7 countries</a> are preparing to ask AI companies to voluntarily commit to certain safety practices.&nbsp;</li><li>Members of Congress urge President Biden to <a href=\"https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-representative-jayapal-lead-colleagues-in-urging-president-biden-to-implement-ai-bill-of-rights-in-upcoming-executive-order\">incorporate the AI Bill of Rights</a> into his <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2023/10/12/biden-government-standards-ai-00121284\">upcoming executive order on AI</a>.&nbsp;</li><li>The United States Space Force has <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-10-11/space-force-pauses-generative-ai-based-on-security-concerns#xj4y7vzkg\">temporarily paused</a> the use of chatbots and other AI systems because of security concerns.</li><li><a href=\"https://nj.gov/governor/news/news/562023/approved/20231010b.shtml\">New Jersey</a> establishes an AI Task Force.&nbsp;</li><li>The new <a href=\"https://colmweb.org/cfp.html\">Conference on Language Modeling</a> is seeking papers on safety, scaling, and other topics.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/video/geoffrey-hinton-ai-60-minutes-video-2023-10-08/\">60 Minutes</a> interviews Turing Award-winner Geoffrey Hinton about AI risks.</li></ul><p>See also: <a href=\"https://www.safe.ai/\">CAIS website</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ai_risks?lang=en\">CAIS twitter</a>, <a href=\"https://newsletter.mlsafety.org/\">A technical safety research newsletter</a>, <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12001\">An Overview of Catastrophic AI Risks</a>, and our <a href=\"https://forms.gle/EU3jfTkxfFgyWVmV7\">feedback form</a></p><p>Listen to the AI Safety Newsletter for free on <a href=\"https://spotify.link/E6lHa1ij2Cb\">Spotify.</a></p><p>Subscribe <a href=\"https://newsletter.safe.ai/subscribe?utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=subscribe-widget-preamble&amp;utm_content=113135916\">here</a> to receive future versions.</p>", "user": {"username": "Center for AI Safety"}}, {"_id": "qp67JqQFDFQNgw6BH", "title": "Back to the Past to the Future", "postedAt": "2023-10-18T16:51:52.412Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "Akmon Ra"}}, {"_id": "peLstYwka2EzxiNG7", "title": "AMA: Six Open Philanthropy staffers discuss OP's new GCR hiring round", "postedAt": "2023-10-18T16:05:13.928Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi everyone,</p><p>We\u2019re hosting an Ask Me Anything session<strong>&nbsp;</strong>to answer questions about Open Philanthropy\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bBefhAXpCFNswNr9m/open-philanthropy-is-hiring-for-multiple-roles-across-our\"><u>new hiring round</u></a> (<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/new-roles-on-our-gcr-team/\">direct link to roles</a>), which involves over 20 new positions across our teams working on global catastrophic risks (GCRs).&nbsp;</p><p>You can start sharing questions now, and you\u2019re welcome to keep asking questions through the end of the hiring round (11:59 pm PST on November 9th).

I'd really appreciate corrections and clarifications if anyone is so inclined!</p><h2>Agreed facts</h2><ol><li>SBF was both the CEO of FTX and the owner of Alameda. Starting in 2019, FTX deposited a significant portion of its customer funds into the bank account of Alameda (SBF's co.). FTX never took them out.</li><li>The FTX T&amp;Cs stated that FTX wasn't allowed to use customer funds. But they <i>did </i>permit customers to effectively use <i>each other's</i> funds, as long as they had enough collateral.</li><li>Alameda was also an FTX customer. From 2019 to early 2022, Alameda (customer) borrowed from FTX customer funds while posting or at least having sufficient collateral.</li><li>During the crypto crash in spring 2022, Alameda faced massive loan recalls from third-party lenders.</li><li>By early fall 2022, SBF was worried about this. SBF (Alameda owner) asked Alameda (SBF's co.) to hedge its assets and was disappointed that it had not hedged sooner. He also asked it to repay the recalled loans and to continue investing. SBF (FTX CEO) decided this was sufficient collateral for Alameda (customer) to continue borrowing from other FTX customers.</li><li>In late fall 2022, the value of Alameda (customer)'s collateral took a nosedive\u2014the hedges hadn't worked\u2014<i>and</i> FTX faced a liquidity crisis akin to a bank run.</li><li>FTX called in Alameda (customer)'s borrows. Alameda (customer) didn't have the liquid funds to pay all of it back and so defaulted on FTX.</li><li>FTX didn't have the liquid funds to cover such a crisis. They would have done if the aforementioned bank account still contained all the customer funds put into it, but Alameda (customer) had spent a lot of them.</li><li>Consequently, many FTX customers could not withdraw their funds.</li><li>SBF was reluctant to file FTX for bankruptcy. He thought he may be able to quickly find the money to pay customers back (either by raising or literally finding\u2014their accounting was chaos). Eventually he was persuaded to file.</li><li>We still don't know if FTX customers will get all of their money back.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Prosecution's narrative</h2><p><i>SBF \"was committing a massive fraud.\" He \"stole billions of dollars from thousands of people\" using a company that was \"built on lies.\"</i></p><ol><li>SBF had premeditated plans to use the customer funds parked in Alameda's bank account and was fully aware that they were being used all along.</li><li>SBF gave Alameda (customer) special privileges because he owned it and was dating its CEO. This included no mandatory posting of collateral, permission to go negative, and having the technical ability to borrow as much as it wanted from FTX customers. Not only did SBF not disclose this to customers, he also lied about it on Twitter in 2019, saying \"Alameda is a liquidity provider on FTX but their account is just like everyone else's.\"</li><li>He also lied to investors and lenders about the financial stability of both companies via FTX's heavy marketing and Alameda's misleading balance sheets.</li><li>In November 2022, he continued lying on Twitter, saying \"FTX is fine. Assets are fine.\" He then deleted the tweet in an attempt to cover up his lies.</li><li>Even if SBF <i>had</i> forgotten about the FTX customer funds in Alameda's bank account, in spring 2022 FTX should have <i>obviously</i> called in Alameda (customer)'s borrows! No prudent businessperson would think Alameda (customer) had enough collateral to secure them at that point. As Alameda's owner, he ordered the Alameda CEO to recklessly gamble with FTX customer deposits. As FTX's CEO, he allowed Alameda (customer) to do so.</li><li>Many innocent customers will probably never get all of their money back.</li><li>SBF's motive was to make as much money as possible to finance his opulent lifestyle\u2014meeting celebrities, splurging on luxury property in the Bahamas and making absurdly large gifts to his family and friends.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Defense's narrative</h2><p><i>SBF \"acted in good faith\" where \"each individual decision seemed fine and I didn\u2019t realize how big their sum was until the end.\" \"It's not a crime to run a company that ends up going through a storm.\"</i></p><ol><li>FTX stored customer funds in Alameda because initially FTX couldn't get a bank account. Then SBF thought the funds were transferred to FTX but they weren't.</li><li>As FTX's first market maker, Alameda (customer) had special privileges that were originally intended to <i>help</i> other customers. And what appear to be COI's are also reasons to put more trust in this customer not to take advantage of FTX. And SBF <i>technically</i> didn't lie on Twitter about this.</li><li>He also <i>technically</i> never lied to investors or lenders.</li><li>In November 2022, he still technically never knowingly lied. Misleading reassurance was in the best interests of FTX customers who stood to lose from a complete loss of trust and 'bank run.' Still, when he no longer stood by his tweet, he removed it.</li><li>SBF didn't notice how bad the situation was for several months because of the chaotic accounting and the awkwardness of talking to the Alameda CEO post-breakup. It was a hard call, but in spring 2022, SBF thought that with hedging, Alameda (customer) would not be taking an unreasonable amount of risk with its borrows. It was reasonable to think it highly unlikely that FTT alone would plummet and that that would be followed by an almost immediate 'bank run' (which seems to have been carefully orchestrated by FTX's main competitor).</li><li>The money was all there.

It's honestly kind of embarrassing &nbsp;for humanity as a whole that hundreds of millions of us are suffering so much simply because they don't have enough money. Couldn\u2019t we just give them some money? Could we actually end global extreme poverty with such an enticingly simple approach? Let's find out!</p><p>We would like to thank GiveDirectly for helping us write this video by providing their detailed research on the topic. They are a nonprofit that delivers donations as cash directly to people in extreme poverty across the world.</p><p>Giving money for people to spend without any restrictions is a type of aid called \u201cunconditional cash transfers\u201d or \u201cUCTs\u201d. &nbsp;Like all forms of aid, there are both advantages and limitations to cash transfers as a whole, and UCTs in particular.</p><p>If we want to end global extreme poverty through cash transfers, we\u2019ll need to raise enough funds, and send them to the people who need them. &nbsp;We also need to be sure that we are actually helping the recipients, and not hurting people who are not receiving anything. &nbsp;We also recognize in advance that there are a host of moral and ethical questions involved with such a large undertaking. &nbsp;For example, who should be given money first? &nbsp;And do we need to prevent people becoming dependent on aid? &nbsp;Additionally, poverty does not exist in isolation from the world\u2019s other major issues such as food security, human rights, and climate change. &nbsp;Those questions won\u2019t be the main focus of this video. &nbsp;Instead, we\u2019re going to focus on what can be achieved with cash transfers.</p><p>Let\u2019s start with some basic facts about how we define global extreme poverty. &nbsp;As defined by the World Bank in September 2022, the international poverty line is $2.15 per day in 2017 US dollars by purchasing power.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdilg770abg\"><sup><a href=\"#fndilg770abg\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; This is roughly equivalent to $1 per day in US dollars in 1987.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsx7axer9tv\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsx7axer9tv\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;At the end of 2022, up to 685 million people experienced poverty worldwide by this definition.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffz7uug7oxr9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfz7uug7oxr9\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The international poverty line represents what we call \u201cextreme poverty\u201d as opposed to \u201cpoverty\u201d in general. Countries can decide to use their own poverty line, but we are going to focus on the most extreme cases of poverty. &nbsp; The international poverty line reflects the cost to cover basic human needs among the world\u2019s poorest people, including food, shelter, and minimal healthcare and education costs. It's set based on the average price for this rough 'basket of goods' a person needs. To be clear, the international poverty line represents a very low standard of living, but one that lets a person avoid an immediate risk of death from starvation, exposure to the elements, or easily treatable diseases. &nbsp;In terms of food, for example, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that in 2017 just 83 cents a day could buy enough food to avoid starvation, but a fully nutritious diet would require more than four times that, at $3.54 per day.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2sny66qfnc\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2sny66qfnc\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;While many organizations consider more than just household income in defining poverty, including the World Bank\u2019s own \u201cMultidimensional Poverty Measure,\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmf6d6zx80k\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmf6d6zx80k\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;the international poverty line remains a popular and useful tool for understanding the world\u2019s poorest people as a population. &nbsp;In particular, the international poverty line is the target used for the 2015 UN goal of ending extreme poverty by 2030 as part of the Sustainable Development Goals.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkpa3baffvjd\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkpa3baffvjd\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefii1ddf30z9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnii1ddf30z9\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpi0ubcyaw79\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpi0ubcyaw79\">[9]</a></sup></span>As GiveDirectly puts it, getting everyone above the international poverty line is not a high bar \u2013 it\u2019s the lowest, and it\u2019s one we should be able to clear.</p><p>And reaching this bar can change lives, and entire communities. Our team spoke by video call with one Rwandan woman, Valentin Oramahoro, in a village that had received cash from GiveDirectly several months prior. &nbsp;She spoke about how she was able to invest in her store by moving to a new building with floors made of cement instead of uncovered ground. She also bought a tea kettle, and made new kinds of merchandise, like soft drinks, available to her community. &nbsp;She mentioned that her proceeds from her store doubled from about 3 dollars to about 6 dollars per day, both thanks to her improvements to the store and from people in her community having money to spend after meeting their basic needs. &nbsp;With the money they received, her neighbors could afford food every day, get cement for their floors, buy new livestock and farm tools, and more.</p><p>A 2016 review of the scientific literature by Francesca Bastagli and her colleagues at the Overseas Development Institute<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreft8tlu37xkq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnt8tlu37xkq\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;helps clarify the picture in the aggregate. &nbsp;As expected, household income and spending both increase for people receiving cash transfers. &nbsp;Most studies also found that cash transfers improve a wide variety of other outcomes: including improving dietary diversity, increasing the number of medical checkups, and increasing the number of businesses and the productivity of farms. &nbsp;Adults receiving cash in most of the studied programs spent about the same amount of time working, while children receiving cash spent fewer hours working for pay and more time in school.</p><p>These effects are quite persistent: studies of a 2008 lump sum cash transfer of 380 US Dollars in Uganda showed positive economic effects on recipients four years later. &nbsp;Though a follow up at 9 years did not find a significant effect on incomes, in another study at 12 years during the COVID-19 pandemic the authors found that people who received cash transfers were able to better withstand the economic effects of the pandemic due to their type of occupation.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefivzcho8l2lm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnivzcho8l2lm\">[11]</a></sup></span></p><p>The benefits to people receiving cash transfers are clear. &nbsp;So how much money would we need to bring everyone above the international poverty line? &nbsp;As a rough guideline, suppose we found every person in extreme poverty and added up the amount they\u2019d each need to get just above the poverty line. &nbsp;The Brookings institution estimates this quantity, called the \"poverty gap\", to be around $100 billion each year.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrltplo5ry6\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrltplo5ry6\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The real amount we\u2019d need will be different, and we\u2019ll discuss the reasons why in a moment, but we shouldn\u2019t expect it to be many times lower or higher.</p><p>$100 billion is certainly a large amount of money, but given the scale of the problem, it\u2019s actually quite manageable. &nbsp;According to the OECD, governments worldwide gave over $201 billion of official development assistance in 2022.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefv5h9yihqnr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnv5h9yihqnr\">[13]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; The OECD defines this type of assistance as resources sent from governments to developing countries with promotion of economic development and welfare as the main objective. &nbsp;GiveDirectly estimates less than 5% of this is being given directly as cash to individuals; the exact amount is not being tracked by the governments giving this aid. &nbsp;Of humanitarian aid, which aims to provide short-term relief from specific disasters rather than long-term development,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjm9ipxbxwti\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjm9ipxbxwti\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;around $5.6 billion of cash aid was given in 2019, out of a total of roughly $30 billion.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5cqzxc32ux3\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5cqzxc32ux3\">[15]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Governments also don\u2019t need to be the only source of funds: existing cash aid is dwarfed by the $1.5 trillion held by charitable foundations in 2018,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2l89ymgg1el\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2l89ymgg1el\">[16]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and total charitable donations from wealthy individuals, companies, and the general public surpass the $100 billion total many times over each year.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefumjnljpbo5\"><sup><a href=\"#fnumjnljpbo5\">[17]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; So while the increase in total aid would be comparatively small, the increase in cash aid would be very substantial.</p><p>If we as a civilization decide to go through with this plan, how would we get the money to the people who need it, and how much additional funding would that require?</p><p>For starters, communications technology will be a big help. &nbsp;GiveDirectly in particular sends money through mobile payments, with their field workers giving SIM cards and phones to recipients. &nbsp;This helps recipients keep their money secure, simplifies the payment process, and gives the recipients an additional tool to help improve their lives. &nbsp;GiveDirectly has even helped set up cell phone towers to make these payments work.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref86jee2g6hb8\"><sup><a href=\"#fn86jee2g6hb8\">[18]</a></sup></span></p><p>The organizations that are in charge of the cash transfer program will also have some maintenance and delivery costs. &nbsp;GiveDirectly\u2019s financial releases<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1a0aziljtaa\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1a0aziljtaa\">[19]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;show that around 90% of the money they raise actually reaches recipients. &nbsp;A similar style of program designed to reach everyone in extreme poverty would have some new challenges, such as reaching refugees or very remote communities, but would also benefit from economies of scale.</p><p>We\u2019ll also have to determine who should get the money and how much. &nbsp;This is often called \u201ctargeting\u201d. &nbsp;Any system for targeting will necessarily introduce inefficiencies. &nbsp;Money we spend on finding who is eligible is money that we don\u2019t give out. &nbsp;Since our goal is to end global extreme poverty, we should be more focused on making sure that no one below the poverty line is excluded rather than avoiding including people who are just above the poverty line. &nbsp;Additionally, many people close to the poverty line don\u2019t primarily earn income as currency, so it might not even be possible or meaningful to identify them as just below or just above the international poverty line. &nbsp;One popular method for targeting aid is \u201cproxy means testing\u201d, that is using information about people\u2019s living conditions to estimate their income. &nbsp;A statistical analysis by researchers at the World Bank<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefibvq39bgu5\"><sup><a href=\"#fnibvq39bgu5\">[20]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;found that in places with a high poverty rate, giving based on proxy means testing can actually cost more and be less effective than paying the same amount to everyone, or nearly everyone. &nbsp;For these reasons and others, it would likely be easier to spend our effort raising more money to give to those on the margin of poverty in poor communities rather than on meticulous targeting and means testing.</p><p>What about corruption? Corrupt actors \u2013 both local and foreign \u2013 are already skimming off at least tens of billions of dollars from the economies of Africa\u2019s poorest nations.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefycawp20r9nf\"><sup><a href=\"#fnycawp20r9nf\">[21]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; If we want to transfer money to hundreds of millions of people in these nations, the region\u2019s governments will have to be important partners. &nbsp;Giving money via mobile payments directly to recipients reduces the chance for funds to be lost to corruption, but we will still inevitably lose some, and we\u2019ll have to spend some resources stopping corrupt actors within the project, given its large scale. &nbsp;Of course, this is a problem with any aid program: cash is no riskier than other forms of aid in this respect.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefi8kq4l4kky\"><sup><a href=\"#fni8kq4l4kky\">[22]</a></sup></span></p><p>Overall, other than the 100 billion dollars estimated to close the annual poverty gap, most of the additional costs come from inefficiencies in the targeting method, with the other factors such as corruption and delivery costs accounting for smaller portions. &nbsp;The people we spoke with at GiveDirectly weren\u2019t ready to share an ultimate number, but their rough estimate is $200 to $300 billion dollars to reach everyone in extreme poverty for the first year of our project. This figure is in line with estimates from other organizations based on population data. &nbsp;Once again, as big as this figure is, it\u2019s less than one 500th of the world\u2019s economy at $160 trillion dollars, and only about 1% of the government budgets of the world\u2019s wealthier nations at $27 trillion.</p><p>So we know the amount of money, while large, is not insurmountable for developed nations. &nbsp;It wouldn\u2019t even be that large an increase over existing aid. &nbsp;We also know that cash transfers improve recipients\u2019 lives immensely. &nbsp;But what would be the effects on recipients\u2019 neighbors, and the economy as a whole?</p><p>A 2022 study led by Dennis Egger<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvxljxuu7x8p\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvxljxuu7x8p\">[23]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;found that every $1,000 of cash given actually had a total economic effect of $2,500 thanks to \u201cspillover\u201d effects growing the local economy, as recipients spent more money at their neighbors\u2019 businesses, and those businesses spent money, and so forth. &nbsp;Not only did recipients\u2019 incomes increase, their neighbors\u2019 incomes also increased by 18 months later. &nbsp;Even neighboring villages without any recipients saw slightly increased incomes, which could have been from a \u201cspillover\u201d effect as well. &nbsp;These effects mean our cash transfers will go farther, and we may find that we\u2019ve reached our goal of ending extreme poverty sooner \u2013 and for less money \u2013 than we would otherwise expect. &nbsp;The research suggests that the $200 to $300 billion figure we\u2019d need to give for the first year will decrease every year thereafter as the economies of entire regions and countries grow and lift their poorest residents out of extreme poverty.</p><p>What about Inflation? &nbsp;As it turns out, the effect is minimal. &nbsp;Average price inflation was only 0.1%, and no category of goods saw a price increase of more than 1.2%. &nbsp;GiveDirectly thinks that price increases are so low because places with the most extreme poverty have a lot of economic \u201cslack\u201d, so local businesses and farms can easily grow to supply more goods to their new customers.</p><p>We know less about unconditional cash transfers at the largest scales, with millions of recipients. &nbsp;The best examples of this kind of transfer so far might be economic stimulus programs run by governments, such as during the COVID-19 pandemic. &nbsp;Several wealthy countries spent over 15% of their GDP on stimulus<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2nrhlu0uh93\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2nrhlu0uh93\">[24]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and some such as the USA and Japan provided direct cash payments to their residents. &nbsp;This of course has had many far reaching effects on the economy of these countries and the world, some of which remain to be seen, and which are hard to disentangle from the effects of the pandemic itself. &nbsp;A cash transfer of $100 billion to the world\u2019s poorest people would not have nearly as large a price tag as these multi-trillion dollar programs, and would not have as big an impact on world finance. &nbsp;It would, however, cause a much larger improvement on the lives of the recipients, because they are the people most in need of it. &nbsp;So while we\u2019ll need to monitor the indirect effects carefully, it does seem like giving unconditional cash transfers to the world\u2019s poorest people is a viable path for ending extreme poverty.</p><p>All of this shows that we need to look at ending global extreme poverty not as some distant unreachable dream, but as a feasible goal that we could accomplish with global coordination. &nbsp;Cash transfers are only one way to approach the problem, but they are incredibly effective, and could be the most useful tool for radically reducing global poverty we\u2019ve seen yet. &nbsp;We can act, and we should. &nbsp;Hundreds of millions of people\u2019s lives and livelihoods are at stake.</p><p>If you're inspired to take action, we've started a fundraiser to send money directly to families in need and do our part to help accelerate the end of extreme poverty. You can donate directly through YouTube, or at GiveDirectly.org. &nbsp;Every donation - even a small one - is impactful, as it helps GiveDirectly reach more families and demonstrate to policymakers that there's popular support for trusting people in poverty. &nbsp;If every one of our subscribers gave just $1 today, that could mean reaching nearly 1,000 more people with the funds to help meet their needs and transform their lives. &nbsp;To stay informed, you can sign up for GiveDirectly\u2019s newsletter<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref78uvtvmv9k3\"><sup><a

There is no safe level of lead; neuro-cognitive effects in children and cardiovascular health effects in adults are apparent even at very low levels of exposure.</li><li>A shared understanding of lead\u2019s danger has already motivated dramatic global action to reduce the burden of lead exposure\u2014specifically, the complete global phase-out of leaded petrol.</li><li>Lead poisoning is preventable; most cases of lead exposure result from sources with safe and readily available alternatives. Eliminating ongoing lead exposure is needed to prevent brain damage in children and the loss of potential of entire generations.</li><li>Nevertheless, lead remains a valuable and in-demand commercial commodity. Some industrial applications of lead are still considered \u201cessential\u201d by some stakeholders\u2014most notably use within lead-acid batteries, which account for more than 85 percent of lead in current circulation.</li><li>Most wealthy countries have dramatically reduced lead exposure since they took domestic actions to do so, including the phase out of leaded petrol and lead paint, though hot spots of lead exposure remain in some locations, particularly among vulnerable populations.</li></ul><h3>Lead poisoning remains widespread across low- and middle-income countries</h3><ul><li>The danger of lead is well recognized, but the scale of ongoing global lead exposure is not.</li><li>Though data is limited, current estimates suggest that <strong>the</strong> <strong>scale of lead poisoning today remains extraordinary</strong>, impacting an estimated 815 million children\u2014one in three children worldwide.</li><li><strong>Most of these children live in LMICs;</strong> in low-income countries, it is estimated that more than half of children have lead exposure levels that can be considered lead poisoning, along with high proportions of adults.</li><li>Within LMICs, significant sources of lead remain and continue to be introduced into the natural and home environments.</li><li>The sources of ongoing lead exposure vary within and across LMICs, but include battery recycling, spice adulteration, ceramic and aluminum cookware, cosmetics, paint, environmental contamination, and traditional medicines, among others. The relative contribution of these different sources is not yet well characterized.</li></ul><h3>Ongoing lead exposure is a profound, preventable, and neglected threat to health, educational, and development prospects in countries around the world</h3><ul><li>Through its impact on children\u2019s cognitive development, lead exposure is estimated to be responsible for over a fifth of the learning gap between high-income countries and LMICs. Through this mechanism, a new analysis by the World Bank estimates that lead exposure drives a loss of income worth US$1.4 trillion, equivalent to 1.6 percent of global GDP.</li><li>Lead exposure is recognized as a causal risk factor for cardiovascular disease by the American Heart Association. Through this mechanism, estimates suggest that chronic lead exposure is responsible for between 1.6 and 5.5 million deaths globally each year. Even at the low end of this range\u2014e.g., the current figure put forth by Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME)\u2014the death toll from lead exposure far exceeds deaths from either HIV/AIDS or malaria. A recent World Bank estimate attributes 5.5 million deaths per year to lead exposure, roughly rivalling the death toll from particulate air pollution. The World Bank calculates the cost of this burden to be equivalent to $4.6 trillion, or 5.3 percent of global GDP.</li><li>Childhood lead exposure has a likely though not conclusive role in increasing the prevalence of subsequent conduct disorders, with some evidence also suggesting a link with aggression and criminal behavior. We note that a causal link between lead exposure and these outcomes, if robustly established, could have major implications for many different global challenges, including intimate partner and domestic violence; crime and policing; and gang violence.</li><li>Lead exposure is also a significant contributor to kidney disease, and ongoing scientific inquiries are exploring hypotheses that even low lead exposure may further contribute to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and antimicrobial resistance, though such links are still unproven.</li><li>Though not the focus of this Working Group, lead exposure is also a serious threat to the environment, ecosystems, and biodiversity, particularly among birds, mammals, and reptiles.</li><li>Eliminating sources of future exposure, even among those previously exposed, has significant benefits at individual and population levels.</li><li>Relative to its scale and impact, lead poisoning is extraordinarily neglected; many LMIC leaders are unaware of how widespread lead poisoning is in their own countries, most have no systems in place to detect and prevent lead exposure, and we were able to identify just $11 million in annual philanthropic funding for preventing and mitigating lead exposure in LMICs.</li></ul><h3>Lead poisoning should be elevated as a top-tier global development challenge</h3><ul><li>Lead exposure is a top-tier impediment to global health, education, and economic development; it robs children of their ability to learn and thrive, and deprives adults of years of healthy life.</li><li>Lead exposure is a significant barrier to achieving almost all of the Sustainable Development Goals; it threatens efforts to make progress on poverty, inequality, early childhood development, health, education, growth, clean energy, sustainability, responsible consumption, and the health of oceanic and land-based ecosystems. It also endangers countries\u2019 potential to benefit from the demographic dividend.</li><li>Addressing the global crisis of lead poisoning deserves urgent prioritization as such from national governments, development partners, philanthropists, and multilateral organizations. It should be considered a priority not just for public health and the environment, but also for the education sector and overall child welfare.</li><li>The scale of the crisis demands a multipronged, multiscale approach\u2014one that integrates international, national, and local actions, and which pairs short-term interventions with development of long-term national regulatory, enforcement, and surveillance capabilities in LMICs.</li><li>While the elimination of lead poisoning is a long-term project, there are important tractable steps that can be taken in the short term. There are notable recent success stories from LMICs in removing lead-contaminated products from the market, and there are affordable, highly cost-effective, and immediately actionable measures to do so. There is some evidence such interventions have resulted in significant decreases in population blood lead levels. In the short-term, broad-based public health and regulatory measures (including regulations and enforcement) to eliminate lead in spices, paint, and consumer goods, and to reduce lead exposure from battery recycling, have the highest potential to cost-effectively reduce lead exposure at scale.</li><li>LMIC governments are in the driver\u2019s seat to address this issue\u2014but development partners and philanthropists have an essential catalytic and ongoing role to play in mobilizing advocacy and high-level attention, building capacity for regulation and enforcement, and providing proof of concept for interventions to reduce lead exposure. In particular, generation of local evidence on the prevalence, severity, sources, and/or impact of lead exposure can be very helpful in motivating national action.</li><li>We estimate that $350 million in development assistance through 2030\u2014just $50 million per year\u2014would be sufficient to transform the landscape and mobilize scaled action in LMICs. A small and sustained percentage of total global philanthropic giving or official development assistance would be transformative.</li><li>Effective advocacy, stakeholder engagement, and grassroots mobilization are essential to raise awareness of lead poisoning at the international, national, and local levels; to increase the urgency and accountability of action by governments, international bodies, and industry to reduce lead exposures and contamination, including via effective legislation, regulation, and enforcement; and to empower families and communities to protect themselves from lead exposure to the extent possible. Advocacy should be broad-based and multisectoral, helping motivate public health, medical, environment, education, and industrial constituencies to take action.</li><li>Opportunities for effective intervention remain constrained by serious data and evidence deficits. There is an urgent need for further research and data collection, including vis-\u00e0-vis the local and global prevalence, severity, and impact of lead poisoning; the relative contribution of different sources of lead exposure at the global, regional, and local levels; and the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of interventions to reduce lead exposure and blood lead levels.</li><li>There is also a need for research and development for further solutions, including improved and lower-cost technologies for exposure detection, source evaluation, and remediation. More research is needed to evaluate and compare the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of environmental, policy, and medical interventions.</li></ul><h3>The Working Group calls for dramatic action&nbsp;</h3><ul><li>We call on global leaders to take bold and urgent action that will end this slow-moving crisis; protect children\u2019s potential to learn and thrive; and dramatically reduce unnecessary, preventable deaths from cardiovascular disease.</li><li>As a global community, we must <strong>pledge to</strong> <strong>end lead poisoning for the next generation of children</strong>\u2014no matter where they live.<ul><li>Every country should begin working today to end childhood lead poisoning by 2040; in concrete terms, this means ensuring that to the extent possible every child has a blood lead level below 5 \u00b5g/dl, and progressively reducing levels \u201ccloser to zero\u201d below that point.</li></ul></li><li>Since children in LMICs are disproportionately affected, LMIC governments must work urgently with support from development agencies, the UN system, and multilateral development banks to take national action to <strong>reduce and prevent additional lead contamination</strong> of homes, workplaces, supply chains, and the environment, including through strict regulations (and their enforcement) on all sources of lead, extended producer responsibility where it is required, and bans on non-essential uses in consumer products.</li><li>To support immediate mitigation efforts, as well as longer-term progressive reductions in blood lead levels, countries should urgently build surveillance systems for nationally representative blood lead measurement combined with source assessment where necessary, calling on the assistance of WHO and UNICEF as needed and appropriate, with a goal of reporting initial results by end-2026. Development agencies, multilateral development banks, and international organizations should provide financial and technical support for these efforts, also as needed and appropriate, including to help build laboratory and field sampling capacity.</li><li>In parallel, countries should work to evaluate and integrate lead exposure prevention and lead poisoning diagnosis and treatment into universal health coverage systems, as appropriate for their respective levels of development and resource availability. This should include adaptation and implementation of WHO guidelines on managing lead exposure, and ensuring the availability of diagnosis and indicated treatment (chelation therapy) for severe lead poisoning.</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/call-action-end-childhood-lead-poisoning-worldwide.pdf\"><i><strong>See PDF</strong></i></a><i><strong> for full endnotes, explanations, and citations.</strong></i></p>", "user": {"username": "LuciaC"}}, {"_id": "vXzEnBcG7BipkRSrF", "title": "How has FTX\u2019s collapse impacted EA?", "postedAt": "2023-10-17T17:02:28.306Z", "htmlBody": "<h1><strong><u>Summary of Findings</u></strong><br>&nbsp;</h1><p>It has been almost a year since FTX went bankrupt on November 11, 2022. Some of the ways that has impacted EA have been obvious, like the shuttering of the FTX Foundation, expected to be one of the biggest EA funders. But<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/i7DWM6zhhPr2ccq35/thoughts-on-ea-post-ftx?commentId=pJMPeYWzpPYNrhbHT\">&nbsp;<u>recent discussions</u></a> show that the broader impact of the FTX scandal on EA isn\u2019t well understood, and that there is<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/i7DWM6zhhPr2ccq35/thoughts-on-ea-post-ftx?commentId=sPEKggZo3MLyEeboq\">&nbsp;<u>a desire for more empirical evidence</u></a> on this topic. To that end, I have aggregated a variety of publicly available EA metrics to improve the evidence base. Unfortunately, these&nbsp;<strong>wide-ranging perspectives clearly show a broad-based and worrisome deterioration of EA activity in the aftermath of FTX.</strong></p><p>Previous attempts to quantify how FTX impacted EA have focused on surveys of members of the EA community, university students, the general public, and university group organizers. These surveys were conducted in the months following FTX\u2019s collapse. Their results have been framed as relatively innocuous by the researchers who conducted the surveys and CEA leadership, as exemplified by how Ben West (interim Managing Director of CEA) introduced a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SFAMvCxnEzaQHNeSL/how-has-ftx-s-collapse-affected-public-perception-of-ea\">June forum post on this topic</a>:</p><blockquote><p>From the research we have on attitudes toward EA from the EA community, the general public, and university students,&nbsp;<strong>it seems that the FTX crash hasn\u2019t, overall, impacted sentiments toward EA very much.&nbsp;</strong>This is not to say that FTX has not significantly impacted people in many ways, including mental and emotional health, levels of trust in EA leadership, and increased uncertainty in EA as a movement. (emphasis added)</p></blockquote><p>Other community members interpreted the survey responses of the EA community in a much more negative light, particularly noting the large magnitudes of decreased satisfaction (\u201c0.5-1 points on a 10-point scale \u2026 [to] ~7.5/10\u201d) and the percentage of respondents (30%) saying \u201cthey had substantially lost trust in EA public figures or leadership\u201d. This more negative interpretation seems well supported by my analysis of a much more comprehensive, and more up-to-date, set of metrics that measure the behaviors these attitudes motivate.</p><p>A clear inflection point is apparent across metrics after FTX collapsed, and subsequently&nbsp;<strong>we can observe a persistent, ongoing, and meaningful negative impact on most publicly available EA metrics. These negative impacts are apparent throughout the EA \u201cgrowth funnel\u201d:</strong></p><ul><li>Top of the funnel: subscriptions to the EA Newsletter were increasing by ~290/month prior to FTX and are now contracting by ~150/month. Traffic to the Intro to EA page on effectivealtruism.org is now at the lowest levels since 2017.</li><li>Middle of the funnel: assorted EA Forum usage metrics are now plateauing or declining after a long period of rapid growth pre-FTX. Donors/donations to EA Funds have also been negatively affected; after years of consistent growth, the number of EA Funds donors has been steadily falling post-FTX.</li><li>Bottom of the funnel: the rate of new GWWC pledges is down ~70% post-FTX, and participation in the In-Depth Virtual Program has slowed meaningfully.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My goal in conducting this analysis is to facilitate a better answer to the question: what has happened to EA in the wake of FTX? I see this as the first of three important questions. These questions need to be addressed sequentially and for that reason, I have intentionally avoided the two subsequent questions. But I hope a better understanding of&nbsp;<i>what</i> has happened will allow the community to address these other questions going forward:</p><ul><li>Why<i>&nbsp;</i>did FTX impact EA the way it has? (For instance, how can we disentangle the effects of reduced funding being available, disillusionment with EA principles, disillusionment with EA leaders, and other factors? I have included a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vXzEnBcG7BipkRSrF/how-has-ftx-s-collapse-impacted-ea#Additional_data_that_would_shed_more_light_on_FTX_s_impact_and_its_causes\">list of additional data</a> that would facilitate that sort of attribution.)</li><li>Given what has happened, and why it happened, what should be done next?</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>These questions are important to answer, but that cannot be done without an accurate understanding of what has happened to date. I hope the evidence I\u2019ve collected will help with that endeavor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong><u>Detailed Findings</u></strong></h1><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2><strong><u>Notes on Data Sources and Presentation</u></strong><br>&nbsp;</h2><p>Unless otherwise noted, the data presented below comes from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\"><u>CEA\u2019s dashboard</u></a> and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/stats/overview\"><u>EA Funds dashboard</u></a>. Data from CEA\u2019s dashboard was accessed when it had last been updated in mid-September. Immediately prior to publication, I noticed that this dashboard had been updated again on October 9. I don\u2019t believe that additional data changes the overall picture enough to warrant a rewrite to include it, though I do note that the metrics for subscriptions to the EA Newsletter and visits to the Effectivealtruism.org Intro page showed some encouraging upticks in September. EA Funds data extends through the end of September.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsyjuxfq65r\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsyjuxfq65r\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>When charts are presented below, I\u2019ve included a red line to indicate the timing of FTX\u2019s collapse. For monthly data series, I\u2019ve marked November; it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that FTX went bankrupt mid-month on November 11th.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong><u>Donation Data</u></strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>EA Funds: Donation and Donor Data</h3><p>FTX has had an obvious negative impact on the number of donors giving through EA Funds. Since EA Funds was founded in 2017 it had experienced positive year over year growth in the number of monthly donors every single month (albeit at a slowing rate); this lasted until December 2022, the first full month after FTX\u2019s collapse. 2023 has seen declines relative to 2022 of ~10% at the start of the year deteriorating to ~20% in September<strong>. September 2023 had the fewest donors of any month since November 2020.</strong></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vXzEnBcG7BipkRSrF/uyaz7ryyenwrs0kubqae\"></strong></p><p>The 2022 giving season, which immediately followed FTX\u2019s collapse, also illustrates the speed and degree with which the scandal impacted EA Funds donors. Averaging across the five previous years, December had 36% more donors than November. 2022 saw an increase of only 6%; in other words, the FTX scandal essentially eliminated the effect of giving season for this metric.</p><p>FTX also appears to have had a material negative impact on the amount of money donated through EA Funds (though this metric is more susceptible to large outlier donations). The EA Funds dashboard shows donation data dating back to 2020.&nbsp; Through the end of September (the last month of full data at time of writing), donations in 2023 were -23% behind 2022, -57% behind 2021 (a particularly strong year), and just 6% ahead of 2020 at the same time of the year.</p><p>These figures would look even worse if not for abnormally large September 2023 donations to the EAIF ($432k donated in September vs. a total of $480k raised from January-August) and the LTFF ($875k donated in September vs. a total of $1.3 million from January-August).&nbsp;As of the end of August, 2023 donations were -35% behind 2022, -66% behind 2021, and -12% behind 2020.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vXzEnBcG7BipkRSrF/pvhiwj5zrhwijz9qrte1\">&nbsp;</p><p>Note: October 2023 data in this chart should be ignored, as it only captures a small part of the month\u2019s giving.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like the number of donors, the amount donated through EA Funds also suffered in the giving season that immediately followed FTX\u2019s collapse.&nbsp;December 2022 donations were 2.6x the average of the previous three months, compared with 5.2x in 2021 and 4.3x in 2020.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>GWWC Pledges</h3><p>Pledge data from Giving What We Can shows a clear and dramatic negative impact from FTX. The rate of new monthly pledges has declined ~-70% from 2023 vs. 2022 (even if one ignores January 2023\u2019s -80% decline vs. January 2022 which&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jpyMhAPSmZER9ASi6/my-updates-after-ftx?commentId=QrczZayFnQmRd2jJc\"><u>might be due to the lack of a 2023 pledge drive</u></a>.)

From the start of December 2022 through the start of September 2023, the newsletter lost an average of 153 subscribers per month. At time of writing, this new trend shows no sign of abating.

My interpretation is that the FTX scandal dramatically increased traffic to the EffectiveAltruism.org homepage, but probably (though not definitively) led to a decrease in traffic from people who wanted to learn more about EA.</p><p>Traffic to the homepage had been roughly range-bound between 10-20k views/month from April 2017 to July 2022. At that point, traffic leapt dramatically up to ~50k views in October, presumably due to the media blitz around the release of What We Owe the Future. November, the month of FTX\u2019s bankruptcy, saw views almost double from the already elevated October levels. Since then, traffic has fallen quickly but remains well above the long-term range.&nbsp;</p><p>It is difficult (at least with publicly available data) to disentangle how much post-FTX traffic is due to FTX as opposed to WWOTF or other sources. It\u2019s also not obvious if we should interpret post-FTX traffic as a good thing or a bad thing. If people are visiting the site and becoming interested in EA that\u2019s probably good; if people are visiting the site because they want to learn more about how SBF was virtue signaling while committing fraud, that\u2019s presumably bad. As discussed in the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/newPost#Google_Search_Interest\">Google search interest section</a>, after FTX more of the searches related to EA have negative connotations (e.g. people searching for \u201ceffective altruism cult\u201d) which suggests we should be wary of the quality of homepage traffic.</p><p>CEA also provides data on traffic to the \u201cintro to EA\u201d page. I think changes in this metric are a reasonable proxy for \u201cchanges in traffic we want\u201d (since it captures people trying to learn more about EA). This traffic has been declining steadily since FTX, and the last few months have registered the lowest levels since the data history starts in 2017. This of course suggests that FTX has had a serious negative impact. However, one could also interpret the data as indicating that the post-FTX decline in intro page traffic is actually a continuation of a decline that started in February 2022 and was temporarily interrupted by the release of WWOTF. Clouding this picture further, while we know intro page traffic was lower in June 2022 than in February 2022, unfortunately \u201cdata from March-May 2022 is unreliable due to a technical configuration error.\u201d</p><p>While I acknowledge the ambiguity around the interpretation of the intro page traffic data, my personal interpretation is that FTX likely had a moderate to severe negative impact. I find it hard to believe that a) the longest (by far) sustained decline in traffic since 2017 and b) a decline to the lowest levels of traffic since 2017, the timing of which both correspond perfectly to FTX\u2019s collapse, are not significantly driven by said collapse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img style=\"width:100%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vXzEnBcG7BipkRSrF/fkkgyvrav1oa4ont8x4r\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>EA Forum</h3><p>A variety of EA Forum metrics are available through CEA\u2019s dashboard. FTX appears to have stopped, and possibly reversed, the long, consistent trends of growth these metrics had previously been experiencing.</p><p>Generally speaking, these metrics have been climbing rapidly since the data starts (in 2019 or 2020 depending on the metric) and peaked when FTX collapsed. Metrics that include community posts saw an especially high peak (indicating very high forum engagement around the collapse itself) and also show a noticeable early September spike (presumably associated with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH/sharing-information-about-nonlinear\"><u>controversy around Nonlinear</u></a>). Since FTX, all these metrics have been on a clear declining trend, and are generally back to similar levels as ~12-16 months ago.</p><ul><li><strong>Hours of engagement (community, non-community, combined) and Views by Forum users</strong>: have been largely steady the last few months (aside from Nonlinear related spike), roughly back at similar levels to April 2022, a clear departure from pre-FTX growth trend.</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vXzEnBcG7BipkRSrF/etvozhqvdmdbfwgputlt\"></p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vXzEnBcG7BipkRSrF/tdach8iky9h2ucsbloeg\"></p><ul><li><strong>Monthly active logged in users</strong>: this metric had been experiencing particularly fast growth prior to FTX (e.g. October 2022 was up 143% vs. October 2021).

Since then, the metric has declined to approximately April 2022 levels. This could indicate that FTX halted a pre-existing growth trend. However, the summer 2022 spikes conflate the picture, and one could also argue that current values are basically in line with the trend of growth from 2020 and 2021.</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vXzEnBcG7BipkRSrF/vs5mwbjmphrdqnr3jwyn\"><br>&nbsp;</p><h3>Google Search Interest</h3><p>Since the start of 2022,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=2022-01-01%202023-09-19&amp;q=effective%20altruism&amp;hl=en-US\"><u>Google search interest for \u201cEffective Altruism\u201d</u></a> fluctuated modestly until July, noticeably increased around the release of What We Owe the Future, then quickly returned to roughly the high end of the original range. Search interest then spiked when FTX went bankrupt before quickly fading. Since March 2023, interest has been essentially indistinguishable from the first half of 2022.&nbsp;</p><p>This chart shows worldwide Google Trends data for the term \u201cEffective Altruism\u201d.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vXzEnBcG7BipkRSrF/j0nkpwb1w0r9pbawyo50\"></p><p>That said, the proportion of people searching for EA for negative reasons has almost certainly increased post-FTX. This suggests that the number of people searching for EA because they see it as something positive they might want to engage with has very likely declined post-FTX.</p><p>The magnitude of this effect is tough to measure, but we can get some indication that it is non-trivial from what Google shows as the \u201ctop related queries\u201d for EA. The first 3 months of 2022 (pre-FTX collapse) have 19 of these related queries, only the last of which (\u201ceffective altruism criticism\u201d) is clearly negative. Meanwhile, 8 of the 19 top related queries for June 1- September 1 2023 seem to have clear negative implications (e.g. \u201ceffective altruism cult\u201d) with half of those directly related to FTX (e.g. \u201csbf effective altruism\u201d and \u201ccaroline ellison\u201d).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>EA Global and EA Global X&nbsp;</h3><p>CEA\u2019s dashboard provides some data about EAG/EAGX. I find it hard to draw meaningful conclusions about FTX\u2019s impact from this data, but I include it for the sake of completeness.</p><p>There are two EAG conferences that could offer comparisons between 2022 (pre-FTX) and 2023 (post-FTX) iterations: EAG London and EAG San Francisco (2022)/EAG Bay Area (2023). The London conference had increased attendance and \u201cconnections\u201d and a roughly unchanged likelihood to recommend in 2023 relative to 2022; the SF/Bay Area conference saw declines across the board.&nbsp;</p><p>I don\u2019t draw much from this data. First of all, since<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dsCTSCbfHWxmAr2ZT/open-ea-global\">&nbsp;<u>EAGs are highly selective</u></a>, applicants would be a much more meaningful metric than either Connections or Attendees.&nbsp;(I\u2019ve asked the Events team for data on applications, but received no response).&nbsp;In a possibly encouraging sign, in April 2023 Ben Todd<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jpyMhAPSmZER9ASi6/my-updates-after-ftx?commentId=QrczZayFnQmRd2jJc\">&nbsp;<u>noted</u></a> that \u201cI've also heard that EAG(x) applications didn't seem affected.\u201d&nbsp;The quantitative data we do have on Connections and Attendees is probably distorted by factors like venue capacity (as venues shifted from 2022 to 2023 in both cases). Also, it might not be appropriate to compare EAG SF 2022 to EAG BA 2023, due to the different (albeit nearby) location, different timing (July 2022 vs. February 2023), and less availability of travel funding.&nbsp;</p><p>I think it is even harder to draw firm conclusions about FTX from EAGX data. Berlin is the only location that ran EAGX conferences both pre-and-post FTX. While Connections and Attendance both fell considerably post-FTX,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/ea-global/events/eagxberlin-2023\"><u>the 2023 conference had a reduced budget and had to limit the conference size</u></a>. It\u2019s conceivable FTX contributed to the reduced budget, but without confirmation from the organizers that is pure speculation.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vXzEnBcG7BipkRSrF/i8kecgt0ksjm8xdzmwwh\"></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Virtual Programs</h3><p>CEA runs several types of virtual programs, the largest of which are an Intro program and an In-Depth program. FTX appears to have had a negative impact on participation in these programs. Monthly cohorts in 2022 were larger than their 2021 counterparts, but 2023 participation has generally shrunk (often quite significantly) relative to 2022.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/vXzEnBcG7BipkRSrF/dbl2vrxhxdpvdmp4bw1g\"></p><p>[Methodological note: No programs have data for December 2022.

While 80k published a<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mZmox0G910jw7I9jCoDC6vowz_PcrHRfFoW04G59XMA/edit\">&nbsp;<u>thorough review</u></a> including<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XVeiYoKjG-wQWdR3LGlXCVMCAKqgASx-aFoeiiaKSrM/edit#gid=100554351\">&nbsp;<u>numerous metrics</u></a> in March 2023, these metrics only extend through the end of 2022 and are provided on an annual basis, making it impossible to discern how FTX has impacted them.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>[Edit: 80k has now <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vXzEnBcG7BipkRSrF/how-has-ftx-s-collapse-impacted-ea?commentId=J5wgfxvAJbLXRSENo\">shared updated metric numbers</a>. These generally look better than the other metrics I've looked at, and don't appear to show a big impact from FTX.]&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>University Group Accelerator Program</h3><p>While CEA provides participation data on UGAP, I don\u2019t believe it is possible to do a pre-and-post-FTX comparison on an apples to apples basis, since CEA decided to narrow UGAP to only new university groups (as discussed in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/d83HJFMnEvP6x6LaD/ugap-starter-program-retrospective\"><u>this retrospective</u></a>).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong><u>Additional data that would shed more light on FTX\u2019s impact and its causes</u></strong></h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The information above comes from publicly available sources.

Where quantitative time series data is publicly available, there is a clear and consistent negative inflection point when FTX went bankrupt.</p><p>The metrics included in this analysis generally relate to people in, or at least on the cusp of, the EA community. Surveys of people outside of EA largely find that those people simply aren\u2019t aware of EA. This lack of awareness has likely mitigated FTX\u2019s negative impact on EA, at least in the short-term.&nbsp;</p><p>But I suspect we\u2019re only at the end of the beginning of this saga. As the FTX/EA connection becomes more salient due to SBF\u2019s trial and upcoming book/film projects,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/i7DWM6zhhPr2ccq35/thoughts-on-ea-post-ftx?commentId=BLuMXoARfkc8Gg4ao\"><u>many more people will become aware of EA and this awareness will come with negative connotations</u></a>. We\u2019ve seen meaningful changes in behavior post-FTX from people who previously viewed EA in a very positive light. It seems reasonable to believe that people who have no prior attachment to EA and learn about it in the context of a high-profile fraud could have an even more intense reaction.</p><p>How has FTX\u2019s collapse impacted EA? According to the data, the impact has been quite bad, and one that we might reasonably expect to get worse going forward. This is an unfortunate state of affairs, but it does us no good to ignore it. Without an understanding of what is happening, it is impossible to formulate a good plan about what to do about it.<br>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong><u>Appendix: Meta commentary about data collection and distribution</u></strong></h1><p>The process of writing this post has only strengthened my conviction about an issue I\u2019ve&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hbejbRBpd6quqnTAB/red-teaming-cea-s-community-building-work-2#EAs_should_invest_in_community_wide_metrics\"><u>previously noted:</u></a> I believe the community should assign responsibility to, and funding for, one or more people or organizations to conduct and disseminate this sort of high-level analysis of community growth metrics.&nbsp;<strong>I honestly find it baffling that measuring the growth of EA and reporting findings back to the community isn\u2019t someone\u2019s explicit job.</strong></p><p>This certainly isn\u2019t a novel observation. In 2017,<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fM6Qv7aAe7FJGDC3D/cea-is-fundraising-winter-2016?commentId=iPrTc42Fu4b3R2gKa\">&nbsp;<u>Josh Jacobson noted</u></a> that even at that time such measurement felt long overdue:</p><blockquote><p>I would have expected one of CEA's very first activities, years ago when EA Outreach was established, to begin trying to measure subscription to the EA community. Gathering statistics on number of people donating, sizes of donations, number that self-identify as EAs, percentage that become EAs after exposure to different organizations/media, number of chapters, size of chapters, number that leave EA, etc.</p></blockquote><p>Some progress has been made. I want to acknowledge that two of the most useful data sets for conducting this analysis, dashboards for<a href=\"https://data.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/\">&nbsp;<u>CEA</u></a> and<a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/stats/overview\">&nbsp;<u>EA Funds</u></a>, are relatively new creations. Their creators deserve credit for making this data publicly available.&nbsp;</p><p>However, I find it deeply troubling that CEA leadership does not seem to have incorporated data from those sources into public comments about how FTX\u2019s collapse has impacted EA. This also makes me worry that candidates for CEA\u2019s permanent CEO position, and the hiring committee, might not have an accurate understanding of the current situation. It seems plausible that shifting the current trajectory and restoring community confidence in EA leadership should be at or near the top of the priority list for whoever ends up in that role.</p><p>Evidence-based decision making is a defining characteristic of EA (the first words on CEA\u2019s homepage are \u201cCombining empathy with evidence\u201d), but the mere availability of data is not sufficient. Evidence-based decision making requires distributing that data to stakeholders and having those stakeholders use that information to guide their thinking and actions.</p><p>It seems obvious to me that numerous stakeholders-- including organization leaders, donors of all sizes, group leaders, and entrepreneurs-- would all benefit from having an accurate understanding of EA\u2019s growth trajectory. And it seems just as obvious that it would be tremendously inefficient for each of those parties to conduct their own analysis. It would be in everyone\u2019s interest to receive a regular (every 3-6 months?) update from a reliable analyst. This wouldn\u2019t be expensive (it wouldn\u2019t require anything close to a full-time job initially, though the frequency and/or depth of the analyses could be scaled up if people saw value in doing so). As public goods go, this should be an easy one to provide.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Thanks to a handful of reviewers for their helpful comments and suggestions.</i><br>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnsyjuxfq65r\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefsyjuxfq65r\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>While the upticks are definitely encouraging, and could represent \u201cgreen shoots\u201d, it\u2019s possible they are related to seasonal strength in September associated with the start of the school year.

Annualized, this is similar to what Open Philanthropy gave in 2020 and roughly in line with what GiveWell projected earlier this year, though less than Open Philanthropy gave in 2021 and 2022.

Because of antimicrobials, many of us are no longer at risk from dangerous infectious diseases such as tuberculosis, sepsis, and meningitis. Over time, as we use these drugs to combat infections, the microorganisms we are targeting evolve and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/antimicrobial-resistance\"><u>develop resistance</u></a> to our treatments, rendering them ineffective, a phenomenon known as antimicrobial resistance (AMR).&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)02724-0/fulltext\"><u>At least 1.27 million deaths and 47 million DALYs are already directly attributed to&nbsp;</u><i><u>bacteria</u></i><u>l AMR each year</u></a>, surpassing the toll of both malaria and HIV. This number is rising at an alarming rate and some studies have estimated that, without serious intervention, antimicrobial resistance could overtake cancer as a leading cause of death by 2050 with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amr-review.org/sites/default/files/AMR%20Review%20Paper%20-%20Tackling%20a%20crisis%20for%20the%20health%20and%20wealth%20of%20nations_1.pdf\"><u>10+ million fatalities each year.</u></a></p><p>Although the majority of the AMR burden (over 90%) falls on LMICs, this is a global issue with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/biggest-threats.html#:~:text=More%20than%202.8%20million%20antimicrobial,people%20die%20as%20a%20result.\"><u>over 2.8 million infections, 35,000 deaths</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6929930/#:~:text=The%20CDC%20estimated%20that%20the,billion%20for%20loss%20of%20productivity.\"><u>55 billion dollars in economic losses</u></a> each year in the US alone. Furthermore, because functioning antimicrobials are an essential part of modern medicine, losing them will mean losing our ability to perform surgery and chemotherapy and manage many chronic conditions in a way which has an acceptable level of risk.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>What makes this a difficult problem to solve?</strong></h2><p>To combat the rising tide of AMR, a strong pipeline of novel antimicrobials coming to market is essential (alongside good stewardship and equitable access). Unfortunately, this is far from the case, as demonstrated by the following statistics:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>As of 2021, there were only&nbsp;<a href=\"https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/354545/9789240047655-eng.pdf?sequence=1\"><u>43 antibiotic drug candidates</u></a> in clinical development.&nbsp;<ul><li>Only 2 of these target the most critical, \u201cgram-negative\u201d multi-drug resistant pathogens (for comparison there were<a href=\"https://phrma.org/en/resource-center/Topics/Medicines-in-Development/Medicines-in-Development-for-Cancer-2020-Report#:~:text=Today%2C%20more%20than%201%2C300%20medicines,and%20Drug%20Administration%20(FDA).\"> &gt;1,300 oncology medicines</a> in clinical development at the same point)</li></ul></li><li>In the last&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2022/02/antibiotic-resistance-amr-subscription-payment-model-superbugs/\"><u>40 years we haven\u2019t had any truly \u201cnovel\u201d antibiotics be discovered, developed and commercialised</u></a><ul><li>A novel drug is defined based on its \u201cmechanism of action\u201d (i.e. the way the antimicrobials interact with the microbe to kill them or limit their growth) or it\u2019s core structural motif.&nbsp;</li><li>This means that recently developed antibiotics are closely related \u201canalogues\u201d of existing drugs and therefore are susceptible to the same resistance patterns or see resistance arise faster than with truly novel drugs</li></ul></li><li>Currently it is estimated we need&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3085877/\"><u>10 - 15 new antibiotics per decade</u></a> to stay ahead of AMR, with 4 or more of these needing to be novel.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rKY6DFuAWShyHjoMn/zdkmcpdvkfeelhcadcqm\"></h2><p>The good news is that the development of novel antimicrobials appears to be possible from a scientific standpoint. The problem is that the cost of developing new antimicrobials is very high (<a href=\"https://www.bcg.com/publications/2022/model-for-tackling-antimicrobial-resistance\"><u>$1-5 billion per drug</u></a>), while limited sales (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33402265/\"><u>median $25-75M/year for a 8-12 year market exclusivity period</u></a>) make development unsustainable. Governments have attempted to resolve this issue through \u201cpush incentives\u201d, such as grants and subsidies to support R&amp;D, which have gone some way towards aiding early phase development, but failed to support more expensive, late stage development and commercialisation.&nbsp;</p><p>Even when new antimicrobials are successfully developed, they are often not sold widely due to insufficient profitability, even in HICs.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34251436/\"><u>Of the last 18 antimicrobials to come to market, only the US, UK, Sweden and France have access to more than seven of them. Japan has access to five and Canada just two</u></a>. Given this, it is perhaps unsurprising that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0205166\"><u>new life-saving antibiotics are rarely available in LMICs</u></a>, which have the highest AMR burden. This lack of access is problematic for obvious reasons, but can also further the speed at which antimicrobial resistance develops. Because doctors don\u2019t have access to the diagnostic tools and treatments needed, they often resort to prescribing less effective antimicrobials that are available to them. This gives pathogens an opportunity to develop resistance as explained in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://accesstomedicinefoundation.org/resource/lack-of-access-to-medicine-is-a-major-driver-of-drug-resistance-how-can-pharma-take-action\"><u>following diagram</u></a>.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rKY6DFuAWShyHjoMn/y56sesj96ylgxq9lctth\"></p><h1><strong>Our Solution</strong></h1><h2><strong>Pull Incentives</strong></h2><p>One promising solution for restarting the antimicrobial pipeline and ensuring equitable access to effective drugs is for governments to adopt \u201cpull incentives\u201d. These incentives reward pharmaceutical companies a guaranteed revenue for bringing new, high-value antimicrobials to market, therefore encouraging development and, ultimately, reducing the burden of AMR. Pull incentives can be either financial or regulatory. Some examples include:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Financial:&nbsp;<ul><li>Regular yearly payments (a \u201csubscription\u201d model or \u201cNetflix\u201d payment model) such as the model&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40258-023-00793-w\"><u>the UK is currently piloting</u></a></li><li>One off payments upon approval, or \u201cmarket entry rewards\u201d</li></ul></li><li>Regulatory:&nbsp;<ul><li>Fast track regulatory reviews</li><li>\u201cTransferable exclusivity vouchers\u201d which can be used to extend the market exclusivity of any of the companies products or sold to another company</li></ul></li></ul><p>Of the options that have been widely discussed for pull incentives, we favour subscription model as the most promising option to:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Improve the antimicrobial ecosystem through creating a sustainable market</li><li>Encourage innovation by rewarding the highest value antimicrobials more so than less valuable drugs</li><li>Ensure appropriate usage (therefore reducing resistance to these new drugs) through fully decoupling sales volumes from revenue and ensuring supply as part of a contract for ongoing payments.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34724432/\"><u>However, subscription models are also the most expensive of these options for governments in the long term</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Recent analysis by the Centre for Global Development has shown these types of incentives have the potential to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/blog/world-needs-new-antibiotics-proposed-us-program-develop-them-would-pay-281\"><u>save millions</u></a> of lives and give G7 and EU governments a return on investment of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/blog/g7-investments-new-antibiotics-would-pay-big-everyone\"><u>23:1</u></a> within their own countries, which rises to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/blog/world-needs-new-antibiotics-proposed-us-program-develop-them-would-pay-281\"><u>125:1</u></a> when taken globally.&nbsp;</p><h2><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rKY6DFuAWShyHjoMn/dpb3xmetlsaads1froa9\"></h2><p>Many of the world\u2019s largest economies have already given vocal support for pull-incentives, including the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.g7germany.de/resource/blob/974430/2042058/5651daa321517b089cdccfaffd1e37a1/2022-05-20-g7-health-ministers-communique-data.pdf?download=1\"><u>G7 health</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1040016/AMR_-_G7_Finance_Ministers_statement_on_supporting_antibiotic_development_-_final_-_13_Dec_2021.pdf\"><u>finance ministers</u></a> and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amr.solutions/2019/07/05/amr-stays-on-the-g20s-to-do-list-with-calls-for-push-and-pull-mechanisms/\"><u>G20 health ministers</u></a>. However, only the UK and Sweden have taken action to implement pilots, with the US (<a href=\"https://www.young.senate.gov/imo/media/doc/pasteur_act_summary.pdf\"><u>The PASTEUR Act</u></a> - potentially worth up to $6Bn over 10 years), EU (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37226746/\"><u>Transferable Exclusivity Vouchers scheme</u></a>, 10 vouchers over 15 years), Canada (<a href=\"https://www.cca-reports.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Overcoming-Resistance_EN_OnePager.pdf\"><u>Subscription model, similar to the UK</u></a>), and Japan (<a href=\"https://amr.solutions/2023/08/22/mhlw-plan-to-pilot-pull-incentives-in-japan-further-details/\"><u>Subscription model, similar to the UK, but likely much smaller</u></a>) considering passing their own policies.</p><p>From our initial analysis of the space, it seems that this lack of action is due to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34205554/\"><u>antimicrobial resistance not being a national priority, uncertainty around how to adopt pull-incentives, and countries being hesitant to be early adopters</u></a>. We believe that this combination of widespread support but lack of concrete action presents a strong opportunity for impact.</p><p>Although there are already several actors working to combat AMR, few are focused on translating research into policy and supporting pull-incentives as a solution.

The booklet is a study guide containing some framing and commentary plus a reading list. I intended it for a different audience than EA, but it could be relevant to EAs. The title of the booklet is <i>The Cross</i> and there is a Christian influence to it, but it should be useful for secular purposes as well.</p><p>The term \"cross\" comes from the story of Jesus in the Bible, who was tortured and killed on a cross in his pursuit of a large altruistic reward, and who in some sense sought out that cross, because it was the way for him to achieve that reward. Christians have identified \"the cross\" as a way of life to emulate, and have interpreted the concept of \"the cross\" in different ways. Some that I seem to remember having heard are \"self-sacrifice\" or \"ordeal that in itself is of spiritual benefit\". The interpretation that I use in the booklet is \"self-risking\" -- the point isn't to die, or to suffer, but rather to achieve some end, which happens to entail personal risk. (But sometimes those who pursue risky things suffer or die because of them.)</p><p>The bottleneck for some altruistic actions is the personal consequences for pursuing them, and the facing of the possibility of those consequences. The booklet intends to show what pursuing the cross looks like, and undergoing the consequences if they occur. It also talks about the people who are (or could be) in the lives of those who pursue the cross.</p><p>One motivation for writing/reading this that EAs might consider, is that if the transition to artificial superintelligence (ASI) goes well, one of the main remaining (maybe the only remaining?) bottlenecks to doing good, if there are any, will be human culture, politics, social environments, etc. -- whatever is upstream of the political decisions that affect the ASI's plan of action (supposing the ASI may respect human decision-making), or of whatever parts of society ASI can't reach, whether because humans decide they don't want ASI intervention there, or in the case that there isn't enough compute for ASI to micromanage every aspect of people's lives. The people who are the subjects of the books in the booklet often were involved in changing culture, politics, and social environments, and their examples may be food for thought for those who might want to work in those areas. Changing social systems can involve being unpopular, taking unpopular stands, etc. and this generally ends up being a case of pursuing the cross.</p><p>(There may be near-term areas to engage with the social, cultural, and political, like <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/ezra-klein-ai-and-dc/\">AI governance</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/efaDsXGEBQbjDRQJe/political-concerns-not-technical-challenges-are-the-main\">global health and development</a>.)</p><p>The booklet is short and uses some fairly mainstream sources for its reading list, to make it easier to translate (mainstream sources mean more likely to find translations in non-English languages). I tried to use sources that each contributed something of their own to the consideration of \"the cross\".</p><p>One of the sources, <i>Churchill and Orwell</i> by Thomas E. Ricks, I found through the rationalist/EA community (not sure exactly whose post I found out about it from, but likely from <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8EFzxtzfrK9HyjFRD/book-review-churchill-and-orwell\">Sammy Martin's review</a>). Some inspiration for the booklet came from <i>Inadequate Equilibria</i> by Eliezer Yudkowsky, which might have gone on the list if I was writing specifically for rationalists/EAs.</p><p>Some parallel study guides that could be written: maybe the problem is that some people have \"too much self\" to do the best thing they can (their egos are wrapped up in something else, or their nervous systems are tuned to a different kind of work). Perhaps they need to \"reduce their selves\" (less ego, less connection to their natural preferences or psychological orientations) in order to do good, rather than \"risk themselves\". They need to (partially) extinguish or re-engineer themselves.

This article will discuss why the reduction of s-risks could be a candidate for a top priority among altruistic causes aimed at influencing the long-term future. The number of sentient beings in the future might be astronomical, and certain cultural, evolutionary, and technological forces could cause many of these beings to have lives dominated by severe suffering. S-risks might result from unintended consequences of pursuing large-scale goals (\u201c<i>incidental </i>s-risks\u201d), intentional harm by intelligent beings with influence over many resources (<i>agential</i>), or processes that occur without agents\u2019 intervention (<i>natural</i>) (Baumann 2018a).</p><p>Efforts to reduce s-risks generally consist of researching factors that likely exacerbate these three mechanisms (especially emerging technologies, social institutions, and values), applying insights from this research (e.g., recommending principles for the safe design of artificial intelligence), and building the capacity of future people to prevent s-risks.</p><p><strong>Summary:</strong></p><ul><li>Due to coming advances in space settlement and technology\u2014which on Earth has historically enabled massive increases in suffering, despite plausibly increasing the average human quality of life\u2014it is possible that there are risks of suffering on a scale that is significant relative to the scale of the long-term future as a whole.</li><li>Although it is very difficult to predict the effects of interventions on the long-term future, efforts to reduce s-risks might be sufficiently predictable and stable by taking one of two approaches: (1) identifying factors in the near future that could lock in states leading to massive suffering, or (2) putting future generations in a better position to make use of information they will have about impending s-risks.<ul><li>One important risk factor for such lock-in is the deployment of powerful artificially intelligent (AI) agents, which appears technically feasible in the next few decades and could lead to a future shaped by goals that permit causing astronomical suffering.</li><li>Solving the problem of alignment of AI systems with human intent does not appear to be sufficient or necessary to prevent s-risks from AI.</li></ul></li><li>Preventing intense suffering is the top priority of several plausible moral views, and given that it is a sufficiently high priority of a wide variety of other views as well, accounting for moral uncertainty suggests that s-risk reduction is an especially robust altruistic cause.</li><li>Reducing s-risks by a significant amount might be generally more solvable than other long-term priorities, though this is unclear. On one hand, the worst s-risks seem much less likely than, e.g., risks of human extinction. This limits the value of s-risk reduction according to perspectives on which the expected moral value of posthuman civilization is highly positive. That said, marginal efforts at s-risk reduction may be especially valuable because s-risks are currently very neglected, and avoiding worst cases may be easier than fully solving AI alignment or ensuring a utopian future.</li><li>Focusing on preventing worst-case outcomes of suffering appears more promising than moving typical futures towards those with no suffering at all, because it is plausible that some futures could be far worse than typical.</li><li>Incidental s-risks could result from the exploitation of future minds for large-scale computations needed for an interstellar civilization, detailed simulations of evolution, or spreading wildlife throughout the universe without considering the suffering of the organisms involved.</li><li>Agential s-risks could result from malevolent or retributive agents gaining control over powerful technology, or from AIs that deliberately create suffering.</li><li>Natural s-risks could result from future civilizations not prioritizing reducing unnecessary suffering, for reasons similar to the persistence of wild animal suffering on Earth.</li><li>Targeted approaches to s-risk reduction might be preferable to more broad alternatives, as far as they avoid unintentionally influencing many variables in the future, which could backfire. The most robust of these approaches include: research into AI designs that decrease their tendencies towards destructive conflicts or reduce near-miss risks; some forms of decision theory research; promotion of coordination between and security within AI labs; and research modeling s-risk-relevant properties of future civilizations.</li><li>Broad approaches to s-risk reduction have the advantage of potentially improving a wider range of possible futures than targeted ones. Examples of these include: advocating moral norms against taking risks of large-scale suffering; promoting more stable political institutions that are conducive to compromise; and building knowledge that could be used by future actors who are in positions to prevent s-risks.</li></ul></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "Center on Long-Term Risk"}}, {"_id": "T6QPDtJpxgnqqgfm9", "title": "High impact charities in Gaza or Israel?

You know what that means? It means that if you come to the United States Department of Transportation with a plan (barriers around the Grand Canyon, wider lanes on the expressway, no left-turns on Sundays, etc. etc. etc.), the United States Department of Transportation will take your plan \u2013 snatch the blueprints right out of your hand \u2013 and go away and calculate two numbers. The first is the cost: the cold hard cash required to make your plan a reality. The second is the expected number of Americans saved by your plan. They\u2019ll think of every number of Americans that your plan <i>could </i>save and couple it up with the chance that your plan <i>in fact </i>saves that number of Americans. They\u2019ll have each of these pairs be fruitful and multiply and then they\u2019ll sum. I exaggerate and simplify, but only slightly.</p><p>Now the United States Department of Transportation \u2013 or the <i>US Department of Transportation</i>, as I\u2019m sometimes bold enough to call them \u2013 has your two numbers: the cost (measured in dollars) and the benefit (measured in Americans). You\u2019re summoned back into the head honcho\u2019s office and she punches these numbers into the ceremonial calculator: dollars divided by American lives. If the answer is $11.8 million per life or less, she shakes your hand and writes a cheque. If the answer is more than $11.8 million per life, she says \u2018Take a hike. Never talk to me again.\u2019 I exaggerate and simplify, but only slightly.</p><p>Now. I am an American citizen; I care only about the two inevitables. Do you know what I mean by \u2018the inevitables\u2019?</p><p><i>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Dash?

I exaggerate and simplify, but only slightly.</p><p>Now every time the head honcho at the US DoT signs a cheque, my taxes go up. That\u2019s bad. But once the DoT project is complete, my chance of getting smeared across America\u2019s highways goes down. That\u2019s good. I\u2019m a typical American. Every new $20 million DoT project is another 6\u00a2 out of my pocket and at least another 0.000000005 ticks down on the old highway-death-o-meter. It\u2019s a good deal. I\u2019m happy to take it. I\u2019ll have what I\u2019m having. I exaggerate and simplify, but only slightly.</p><p>But then I come across <i>The Precipice</i>: a book written by one Toby Ord of Oxford University, England. In <i>The Precipice</i>, Ord gives us his best guess of the chance that everything goes wrong this century: 1-in-6, Russian roulette. And \u2018everything\u2019 here means <i>everything</i>. We\u2019re talking disaster-movie-without-the-happy-ending. Nuclear conflagration, a modern plague, AI takeover. <i>Armageddon</i>, <i>Contagion</i>, <i>War Games</i>, <i>The Day After Tomorrow</i>, <i>Terminator</i>. Humanity in ruins and remaining so, for all the aeons until our great universe dissipates into fuzz.</p><p>But forget that last part. I never went in for that \u2018deep time\u2019 stuff anyway. Today\u2019s troubles are enough for today, and my troubles are enough for me. Let\u2019s focus on the here-and-now. This century. My life and the life of my children. <i>Russian roulette</i>. Do I feel lucky? I\u2019m a confident guy. I know my way around a screwdriver. I like to think I\u2019d comport myself pretty well in a total breakdown of the social order. But if things go <i>Dr Strangelove</i>, I\u2019ve just got to come to terms with the fact that one of those ICBMs might have my name on it and that no degree of screwdriving-prowess is going to scratch it off.

Only they can make a real dent in my chances of getting fried, or of spluttering out my last in some makeshift hospital ward. And not only can the government do it, <i>the price is right</i>. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DiGL5FuLgWActPBsf/how-much-should-governments-pay-to-prevent-catastrophes\"><u>Carl Shulman and Elliott Thornley</u></a> estimate that $32 billion per year would increase the chance that we make it through the decade by 1-in-200. That\u2019s a small number, but the ceremonial calculator reveals that it\u2019s an even better deal than the one I\u2019m getting from the US DoT: $100 out of my pocket and a big tick down on the old annihilation-o-meter.</p><p>1-in-6, 1-in-200. The numbers are unsettling, but they\u2019re also unsettled. Odds are at home in Vegas where they\u2019re born from the motions of dice, cards, and roulette wheels, and can be confirmed by long painful experience. But Ord has never sat and tallied infernos, never watched his supply of civilizations grow and fall and dwindle to nil. The 6s and 200s are estimates, surmises, guesses, and I\u2019ve bought enough used cars in my time to be wary of numbers plucked from thin air. But still. The question remains. <i>What should we do?</i> Should we renew the nuclear treaties or let them lapse? Should we hire scientists to watch for cooked-up superdiseases or save our money? Should we pump the brakes on AI or let it race ahead? If we do nothing, we\u2019ll be guessing that the risk is low. If we do something, we\u2019ll be guessing that the risk is not so low. Whatever we choose, we\u2019ll be making a guess, so we might as well use our best one. Your best guess might differ from Ord\u2019s, but you won\u2019t know what it is until you make it your best: until you sit down with head clear and heart still and look at what we know. Nuclear weapons are younger than your grandparents and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ILgSesWMUEI\"><u>they\u2019ve fallen out of planes many, many more times</u></a>. Rabies kills all its untreated victims, COVID-19 infected almost everyone, and lab-engineered diseases could do both.

But remember: <i>guessing is not optional</i>. Every action is a choice, and every choice is a guess. So look at what we know; guess, guess, guess; and use your best. If the bombs start falling, how many of us die? If it\u2019s an engineered pandemic, how many of us die? What can we do? How much would it cost? How much would it help?

From my experience, I wouldn't be surprised if this is true even of a majority of people who self-associate with the EA community.</li><li>Some nice potential side effects are (1) you may be more likely to attract the right types of people into the movement and (2) this may improve the EA brand more generally</li></ul><h2>Celebrate the stories of people and organisations who act according to EA values and virtues</h2><ul><li>I'm talking about stories where people/orgs lived up to these values while trying to do the most good&nbsp;<i>they</i> can (given their values/worldview), so as opposed to (only) highlighting people who have a lot of impact ex-post (in whatever way); people who intellectually contribute most to EA; or people who happen to be exceptionally talented/skilled/smart/wealthy/powerful.</li><li>Some example types of stories that immediately come to mind (again, some of which have been promoted by 80k and CEA already)<ul><li>Stories of how people decided to make a radical switch in the cause area they worked in based on impact considerations</li><li>Stories of people/orgs who shut down projects that weren't worth continuing<ul><li>E.g. No Lean Season</li></ul></li><li>Stories mentioned in the Scout Mindset book</li><li>Stories of people/organisations in EA supporting people/organisations in EA with different worldviews (could be moral trade, but also just a general collaborativeness)</li><li>Similar stories of collaboration with non-EA communities and organisations</li><li>Stories of people who toil in the background / don't seek recognition (perhaps even anonymised :))</li><li>Stories of people who tried but \"failed\" in some way</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Give a platform to and more generally reward virtuous members of the community</h2><ul><li>These are many of the main characters in the above stories</li><li>E.g. virtuous earning-to-givers (I could name a few), or people with limited resources who still manage to have a significant impact (in a virtuous way)</li></ul><h2>Organise discussion and debate across cause areas/worldviews</h2><ul><li>I think some kind of cause neutrality/\"cause prio mindset\" (i.e. being willing to change the cause you dedicate your resources to based on impact considerations; ideally even proactively pursuing this) is one of the key if not the key value/virtue that sets EA apart from other communities.</li><li>I get the impression a significant amount of people cluster together in their cause area/worldview groups and feel awkward or even aversive about openly discussing their worldview with people who come to different conclusions (e.g. they may just \"tolerate\" these people's conclusions rather than engage in constructive discussion on this point), which is a situation that's very far away from what I think the ideal is, i.e. a community that's all of safe, challenging and constructive on this point at the same time, where you unite around the values/virtues rather than the worldview/cause you currently end up concluding your resources should go to.</li><li>And obviously this current environment is bad from an epistemic perspective as well, encouraging tribal tendencies around the wrong things (conclusions rather than principles).</li><li>I think even just having a few more sessions at EAG(x)s or 80k podcasts on that discuss this could be a significant step in the right direction. These could e.g. be debates/discussions or just people sharing their own cause prio journey.</li><li>There've been some recent attempts at this I believe (e.g. Michael Plant criticising longtermism at an EAG(x)), but I think a lot more could be done.</li></ul><h2>Promote and facilitate people and orgs with different worldviews supporting and strengthening each other</h2><ul><li>IMO one of the most valuable resources the EA community has or could have is our (potential for) to solve coordination problems and collaborate/trade across such varied people, organisations, causes etc. if indeed we are united by these underlying principles/values/virtues</li><li>Of course this requires some amount of (well-calibrated) trust, but I think also post-FTX there is ample resource to delve into here, e.g. as most trust doesn't have as significant a potential downside as the types of trust that were given to SBF/people at FTX</li><li>Based on my limited information, I expect there are already lots of stories of support and collaboration that could be celebrated (which most people may not know about!); this would be a very simple intervention in this category.</li><li>I also believe there's a lot of room for (organising) productive ideation around how collaboration, support and resource sharing across causes/worldviews could be further improved, e.g. in terms of sharing networks; best practices; mentorship etc. etc.</li></ul><h2>Acknowledgements</h2><p><i>Thanks to Lauren Mee for giving me the inspiration for the contents of this memo in a personal conversation, and to United Airlines for having dysfunctional Wi-Fi on my plane to the US which helped me actually write it (as I couldn't access anything else).</i></p><p><i>Preview image by </i><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@hannahbusing?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\"><i>Hannah Busing</i></a><i> on </i><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/Zyx1bK9mqmA?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\"><i>Unsplash</i></a><i>.</i><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "SjirH"}}, {"_id": "fDpG8cWqPtCdKhoGL", "title": "The role of effective giving in effective altruism (MCF memo)", "postedAt": "2023-10-16T13:31:58.437Z", "htmlBody": "<h2>Context</h2><p><i>On request of the </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/33o5jbe3WjPriGyAR/announcing-the-meta-coordination-forum-2023\"><i>Meta Coordination Forum 2023</i></a><i> organisers, I had written a memo on the effective giving (EG) landscape, my views on EG\u2019s (ideal) relationship to EA, and ways in which other attendees to the MCF could help.

Initial signs are this was a successful event. From the post-event report: \u201c[Attendees] were very likely to recommend the event to similar people (LTR = 9.3/10). On average, attendees reported that the summit was 5.42x more valuable than how they would typically spend their time. [...] Overall, the feedback was overwhelmingly positive.\u201d The Summit seems likely to be organised again next year (pending funding decision).</li><li>GWWC hired for an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://givingwhatwecan.notion.site/Effective-Giving-Global-Coordination-and-Incubation-4b58253d1aea496c97110bb898b0fab3?pvs=4\"><u>EG global incubator and coordinator</u></a> role (Luke Moore) in May and have started putting more resources into supporting and helping organise coordination and collaboration in the global EG ecosystem (in addition to serving our own donor target groups).</li></ul><h2>The (ideal) role of EG in EA</h2><p>Luke Freeman and I recently wrote two EA forum pieces on this for the EA strategy fortnight (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WMdEJjLAHmdwyA5Wm/we-can-all-help-solve-funding-constraints-what-stops-us\"><u>1</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zohs3eYHd8WdhF88M/four-claims-about-the-role-of-effective-giving-in-the-ea\"><u>2</u></a>), which I\u2019d recommend giving a quick read + skimming the comments if you\u2019re interested in this topic. I\u2019ll highlight / elaborate on a few key points below.</p><h3>EG as a funding source</h3><ul><li>As noted above, the overall EA funding space is still dominated by Open Phil and GiveWell, but the (rest of the) broader \u201cpublic\u201d EG space is already plausibly &gt;$100M per year and seems to be growing and to have a lot more room for growth. I wouldn\u2019t be too surprised if it were to increase 10x in the coming ~5 years or so, as there seem to be no fundamental barriers and there are still a lot of untapped \u201cmarkets\u201d/target groups + room to scale within current ones (e.g. Effektiv Spenden in the aim to reach $100M per year in the coming few years - which seems realistic given their growth trajectory and as they\u2019ve only tapped into a small part of the German philanthropic market so far - and this can probably be replicated in other geographies and target groups).</li><li>One big (maybe the biggest) way in which the EG ecosystem could contribute to EA funding is by recruiting new very large donors like Good Ventures. I think at least Founders Pledge, Generation Pledge, Effective Giving (the org) and Longview are working with some donors who could develop into this or to ~within an order of magnitude (i.e. giving more than $10M per year).<ul><li>For this, it\u2019s useful to distinguish between specialised (U)HNW advisory orgs like EG and LV and broad EG fundraising organisations like GWWC and Effektiv Spenden, but we should not exaggerate this distinction: many of the broader fundraising orgs have recently indicated interest in developing their (U)HNW fundraising capacity and several have already done some of this work or are currently making initial efforts. Efforts are also underway for better collaboration between broad and specialised orgs, e.g. forwarding (U)HNW donors to where they can best be advised - as some of these come in via broad fundraising organisations - and sharing best practices and providing training.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>An obvious advantage of having a broader donor base is that this allows for a more reliable/robust funding source (cf. FTX), while the benefits of centralisation can be retained e.g. through pooled grantmaking funds.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EipE75vsDuD7bdJar/gwwc-s-2020-2022-impact-evaluation-executive-summary#Our_donations_follow_a_heavy_tailed_distribution\"><u>From GWWC\u2019s impact evaluation</u></a> (more data&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MF9bAdISMOMV_aOok9LMyKbxDEpOsvZ9VO8AfwsS6_o/edit#gid=1101094492\"><u>here</u></a>), it seems that our money moved is currently to a large extent driven by a few UHNWs and a few dozen HNW donors (rather than from only a handful of UHNW or a large group of small-to-medium donors). I\u2019m not sure whether this is the same for other organisations and whether this will be the best way for us to scale, but it is at least suggestive of that some amount of scale (~$50M per year) can be reached largely via donors giving &lt;$1M per year and at relatively low cost (though lots of caveats here on how much of this can be attributed to GWWC as an organisation and how much of this is replicable; see also our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EipE75vsDuD7bdJar/gwwc-s-2020-2022-impact-evaluation-executive-summary\"><u>impact evaluation</u></a>).</li><li>From GWWC funding data, it also seems plausible that many donors are quite flexible/open in the types of programs they\u2019d support, incl. EA meta (e.g. we have hundreds of small-to-medium donors already giving &gt;$1M per year to EAIF) so in addition to being reliable this could be a funding source to tap into both for EA meta and cause-specific work (we\u2019ll know more if/when we ramp up fundraising efforts for EA meta work, which is likely to be happening to at least some extent in the coming months).</li></ul><h3>EG as an anchor for principles-based EA</h3><ul><li>I think EG has a few features that make it particularly well suited to help spread, set and protect a good culture for a broader principles-/values-/virtues-based EA community.<ul><li>The opportunity to keep engaging with and learning about multiple causes throughout one's life rather than (at some point) being incentivised to choose one to specialise in (and perhaps identify with). Similarly, the opportunity to have fruitful two-way discussions with anyone else in the community about where one can best give (as money = money, even though values/ethics can differ).</li><li>The skin in the game / moral seriousness / costly signal / \u201cpractice what you preach\u201d aspect of EG. In particular, there is always some personal cost to effective giving, whereas with careers there\u2019ll often be convergence with personal interest, e.g. doing things one would have liked to do anyway and making quite a bit of money for oneself. Note I\u2019m not necessarily advocating for a highly frugal or sacrificial EA, but I do think&nbsp;<i>some</i> seriousness and sacrifice are healthy cultural markers and will draw in the types of people a principles-based (core) EA community needs.</li></ul></li><li>This becomes all the more important if there is a move towards cause-specific movement building and/or if certain causes (in particular AI) become a very large part of overall EA resource allocation. This may be the right choice for the community to make, but EG can help protect EA against a drift away from the principles that brought us to that choice in the first place, which (to me) seems highly valuable in the longer term.</li><li>I think&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WMdEJjLAHmdwyA5Wm/we-can-all-help-solve-funding-constraints-what-stops-us\"><u>Luke\u2019s post</u></a> provides a particularly good personal example/story to illustrate some of the considerations here.</li></ul><h3>EG as a growth tool</h3><ul><li>My best guess (and frankly, hope!) is that EA is in many ways still in its infancy; that many (types of) people who would be interested in these principles and able to act on them have not yet been reached; and that many of these people could make contributions that far outstrip the contributions the current community has made to a better world so far.</li><li>I think effective giving can serve as one important tool/gateway to reach these people, e.g. given its<ul><li>Accessibility / Low barrier-to-entry: most people in the world (!) could at least part with some money, and EG is a relatively easy way for them to start&nbsp;<i>doing</i> something with EA principles.</li><li>Educational value: as above, I think messaging around EG can (initially) probably do a better job at educating people new to EA about cause prio and other EA principles than high-impact careers can, in part because it isn\u2019t constrained by people\u2019s personal situation, skills, and identity as much.</li><li>Peer advocacy potential: building on the two aspects above, EA principles can be spread through EG messaging at relatively low cost, as we don\u2019t need tailored advice for each individual and people can largely take a direct example from their peers/friends/family (i.e. anyone who is engaging in EG) rather than needing to be persuaded by specialised career advisors or community builders.&nbsp;<ul><li>Note that this doesn\u2019t just mean we can reach a lot more people more easily, but also that we may be able to reach more&nbsp;<i>types of</i> people more easily, as I\u2019d expect EG outreach is much less constrained by the types of people, career paths and skill sets currently already well-represented in the EA community than direct high-impact careers outreach is. For example, I think it would be easier to introduce my (fictional) aunt working at the highest levels of the European Commission to EA principles via EG than via a \u201chigh-impact careers\u201d or abstract/non-practical \u201cwe should work on the world\u2019s most pressing problems\u201d narrative.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2>Ways you can help</h2><p>I made&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zohs3eYHd8WdhF88M/four-claims-about-the-role-of-effective-giving-in-the-ea#A_few_recommendations_based_on_these_claims\"><u>some suggestions</u></a> in my recent post, and Luke made&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WMdEJjLAHmdwyA5Wm/we-can-all-help-solve-funding-constraints-what-stops-us#What_can_we_do_\"><u>some more personal ones</u></a> in his recent post as well. Three things I\u2019d like to highlight:</p><h3>Doing the basics</h3><ul><li>I think that for most attendees, both the lowest-cost and most valuable way to help would be to pick any low-hanging fruit in promoting effective giving opportunities in your day-to-day work and network.<ul><li><strong>When discussing a problem area in a presentation, interview, or a podcast, default to&nbsp;mentioning EG as an accessible course of action (which doesn\u2019t have to trade off much with others!) and refer the audience to a relevant place to learn more/donate.</strong></li><li><strong>Talk about your own giving choices</strong> to people in your workplace and in your broader network.&nbsp;<ul><li>Many people look up to you as examples; I think the value of doing this is easily underestimated, and it\u2019s super easy (and often fun!) to do.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Refer people with large audiences to EG and EG organisations</strong> to help create new high-profile advocates<ul><li>As a data point here, one of GWWC\u2019s largest wins in the past few years has been Sam Harris promoting the Pledge on his podcast: he has been mentioned as a referral by &gt;800 GWWC Pledgers (i.e. 10% of our current membership!)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>There are some further relatively low-cost opportunities for CEA in particular, e.g.<ul><li>Referring to EG in introductory courses and fellowships</li><li>Promoting EG in an EA groups setting (see also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9sF6Gs95EmjK2nXGQ/why-your-ea-group-should-promote-effective-giving-and-how\"><u>this post</u></a>)</li><li>Making sure people who give a meaningful amount feel more welcome at events where this makes sense, e.g. one idea could be making giving 10% effectively a sufficient (but not necessary!) condition for entrance to EAGX conferences</li><li>Including at least some EG-relevant content at EAG(X)s (which has been happening recently!)</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Reviving EtG</h3><ul><li>Given current funding constraints in EA and in particular EA meta, I think it would be worth putting some more effort into promoting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/earning-to-give/\"><u>earning to give</u></a> as a career path, e.g. setting up communities or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://3394c0c6-1f1a-4f86-a2db-df07ca1e24b2.filesusr.com/ugd/9475db_5bb71c0641bf445c8a51be0a2ea1df8e.pdf\"><u>organisations</u></a> around this.</li><li>Given&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/about/credibility/evaluations/mistakes/#mistakes-concerning-our-research-and-ideas\"><u>past mistakes</u></a> we should obviously tread carefully here: I\u2019m not suggesting it should be pushed hard, but my impression is that earning to give is currently more underrated than overrated by most (in part due to overcompensation for past mistakes, and FTX probably hasn\u2019t helped).</li></ul><h3>Input on the role of EG in AI</h3><ul><li>Last but not least, I\u2019d love your input about ways in which EG could support work on AI issues.</li><li>I/GWWC have only very limited concrete ideas on this so far.&nbsp;<ul><li>One idea is that it would be valuable to have a public AI/x-risk charity evaluator, both for funding and educational/movement building reasons.</li><li>Another (more speculative and personal) take is that it would be helpful to promote EG within AI circles as a way of spreading EA principles and virtues.</li></ul></li><li>I look forward to discussing this with you at the Forum! Please do reach out (e.g.&nbsp;schedule a 1-1) if you have any thoughts.</li></ul><h2>Acknowledgements</h2><p><i>Thanks to the GWWC team, James Snowden, Anne Schulze and Max Dalton for commenting on a draft of this memo (all views and mistakes are my own).&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>Preview image by </i><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/@micheile?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\"><i>micheile henderson</i></a><i> on </i><a href=\"https://unsplash.com/photos/SoT4-mZhyhE?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\"><i>Unsplash</i></a><i>.</i></p>", "user": {"username": "SjirH"}}, {"_id": "E2rqTee8m6cL9Wsen", "title": "Results of tests to promote impactful Vegan Speeches on Social Media in low income countries. \nI would appreciate advice how to further test the impact of this approach.", "postedAt": "2023-10-16T09:38:49.862Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>Vegan Speech Promotion Project results</strong></p><p><strong>Basic idea:</strong></p><p>Promote the best performing and most widely known speeches by Vegan Activists through Social Media in countries with low promotion costs, to reach the largest amount of people possible.</p><p><strong>Where I am with the project:</strong></p><p>I started trying to promote Dominion on Social Media, which saw some success but ultimately the ads were deleted by Facebook (and many other social media sites) as Dominion is against their ad content policy. I did a <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/ufilny/question_would_you_pay_1_for_people_to_watch/\"><u>quick poll on reddit</u></a> which shows that quite a lot of people would be willing to donate towards promoting Dominion. From some more polls I did, it seems like after <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/uf7u63/how_many_of_you_went_vegan_after_seeing_a/\"><u>Documentaries</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/uf7wxl/how_many_of_you_went_vegan_after_seeing_a_speech/\"><u>speeches</u></a> are the single form of activism that gets most people to go vegan.(For comparison I also asked about <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/uf80kv/how_many_of_you_went_vegan_through_street_activism/\"><u>street activism</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/uf7rtm/how_many_of_you_went_vegan_through_vegan_starter/\"><u>Vegan starter programs</u></a>, both of which got less people on Reddit to go vegan. This is also \u2013 to a degree \u2013 backed up by larger and more professional polls like <a href=\"https://vomadlife.com/blogs/news/why-people-go-vegan-2019-global-survey-results#:~:text=17.4%25%20or%202%2C225%20people%20went,and%20the%20occasional%20religious%20motivation.\"><u>this one.</u></a>)</p><p>All of this led me to experiment with promoting some of the larger vegan speeches on Facebook, I tried <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3u7hXpOm58\"><u>Earthling Ed\u2019s</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=james+aspey+speech\"><u>James Aspey\u2019s</u></a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=gary+yourofsky+speech\"><u>Gary Yourofsky\u2019s</u></a>, out of which Ed and Gary got the best results.</p><p><strong>Initial Results:</strong></p><p>I got the best results promoting the speeches as videos directly uploaded to Facebook, with two specific target groups:Target group A: Young (18-30) English speaking people worldwide.Target group B: Young (18-30) English speaking people in countries with a <a href=\"https://trends.google.de/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=vegan\"><u>high search interest</u></a> (At least 10 according to google) in veganism and low income / low promotion costs. (For example: Philippines)</p><p>I ran the tests on this Facebook page I set up: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/humaneworldngo\"><u>Humane World</u></a> with a goal of maximizing engagements. I was interested in 3 metrics:</p><p>Total watchtime</p><p>\u201cHeart\u201d Reactions to the video - The video title each time was <i>\u201cReact with a heart if this speech makes you want to GO VEGAN\u201d,</i> so heart reactions would indicate people who were \u2018reached\u2019 by the speech for lack of a better word.</p><p>Real sessions to the end of the video - I wanted to know what amount of people watching the whole speech to the end are real people (not bots) and are actually watching (not afk), so I uploaded each video with 30 minutes of a black screen and loud static noise at the end, with the idea that any real person actually watching would stop watching as soon as the black screen and static noise starts. So real sessions to the end are the amount of people who stopped watching at that exact point.So here are the results of two of these tests:</p><p>Speech by Ed, Target group A</p><p>Budget: 25 \u20ac<br>Watchtime (hours): 1272<br>Heart reactions: 238<br>Real sessions to end: 46<br>Hours/\u20ac: 50,9<br>Hearts/\u20ac: 9,5<br>Real sessions / \u20ac: 1,8</p><p>Speech by Gary, target group B:</p><p>Budget: 25 \u20ac<br>Watchtime (hours): 308<br>Heart reactions: 556<br>Real sessions to end: 8<br>Hours/\u20ac: 12,3<br>Hearts/\u20ac: 22,2<br>Real sessions/\u20ac: 0,3</p><p>In my personal opinion, these initial results were very encouraging, and getting people to watch the speech for ~30 hours, with about two real people watching to the end, and 15 or so people indicating it made them want to go vegan for every \u20ac spent, seems like a highly effective way to spend money for the animals.</p><p><strong>Later results / feedback:</strong></p><p>Before turning this project into a larger campaign, I wanted to get more confirmation that promoting these speeches actually made more people want to go Vegan. To do so, I tried several different approaches:</p><p>Ask people for comments \u2013 I uploaded the same speeches but switched the title out from \u201cReact with a heart if this speech makes you want to go Vegan\u201d to \u201cLet us know in the comments if this speech makes you want to go Vegan.\u201d The video can be found <a href=\"https://fb.watch/nES-_M0ui5/\"><u>here</u></a>. Unfortunately, even at a promotion budget of around 100\u20ac, this approach did not result in any people commenting that the speech inspired them to go Vegan.</p><p>Ask people to fill out a short survey \u2013 I posted this <a href=\"https://forms.gle/Bp4ofx3U22VU2JF2A\"><u>short survey</u></a> under several of the posts promoting either speech, the survey got a total of 7 responses, of which only one indicated it had actually inspired someone to want to go Vegan.</p><p>Encourage people to fill out a survey with a gift card. - I posted the speeches again with the title \u201cFill out a short survey about this speech for a chance to win a 50$ Amazon gift card\u201d and promoted those posts with a total budget of around 100\u20ac again. Linked under these posts was <a href=\"https://forms.gle/UnQw765i4gMwXoqX6\"><u>this survey</u></a>. While the survey got over 900 responses, all of them without exception seem to be generated by bots (for example when asked to give a short summary of what the speech was about, the vast majority of responses either used a single word, the speech title, a sentence from the survey itself, or a short text on a completely different topic as an answer.)</p><p>Link to a different website \u2013 After the previous attempts to get more confirmation if this was potentially an effective campaign had failed, I created a website GoVeganEasy.org with detailed analytics and promoted the speeches aswell as <a href=\"https://fb.watch/nETMBxZBrL/\"><u>this shorter video</u></a> with a link to the website and website visitors as the ad goal. The website (which is no longer online) featured the documentary Dominion, and information on how to go Vegan. The idea here was to see how long people spend on the website reading the info there and watching the documentary, to judge if people were actually inspired by the promoted content on Facebook to seek more info. On a budget of again around 100\u20ac, a bit over 1000 people visited the website, and on average spent 12 seconds on the website. This means all users combined only spent under 3 hours on the website, which on a budget of 100\u20ac is in my opinion not an effective use of money.</p><p><strong>Advice needed</strong></p><p>So after all four of these approaches failed to produce results that would indicate this project is an effective use of money, I have for now put it on hold.</p><p>The very promising initial results still make me think this could be a highly effective way to get more people to go Vegan, but I will not pursue it further if I cannot confirm this. If anyone has further ideas how to test this, please let me know.</p>", "user": {"username": "PreciousPig"}}, {"_id": "RdTDFDWTpFG3Pb4aQ", "title": "Impactful Budget Tips + Budget Sample from EASE (EA org service providers)", "postedAt": "2023-10-15T23:27:35.771Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>Spending money is how you invest in your organization. What are the best investment options you can make in growing your organization?&nbsp;</strong><br><br>A question I get pretty frequently is&nbsp;\"Should I really be spending money on&nbsp;___? Is that the best use of my funds?\" Counter-factually, an argument can be made to donate to other worthy causes instead of investing in additional support for yours. To answer this question, you need to know about the available&nbsp;potential solutions and determine the expected ROI and impact of whatever resources you're spending. Whether it's time or money, you need to invest in your cause in order to achieve the results you desire. It doesn't help you or your funders to short-change your organization of resources it needs to be more effective. When soliciting funds, ask for what you think will help your organization thrive, not just survive.<br><br><strong>Here's an example: </strong>We've developed a <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UgINPUJ2RnWd_kq-Drjy81daIGEQzcXyaJof4rAHuNU/edit?usp=sharing\"><strong><u>sample budget template&nbsp;</u></strong></a>that covers the most common expenses organizations need to function optimally, and included explanations for each line as to why it's a worthwhile investment and what the anticipated impact is of that investment.

In lieu of the traditional \"final report/paper\" they requested, I am posting my project on the EA forum, so that you can play the game, provide feedback, and hopefully contribute.</p><p>I am new this forum, so I apologize if this is not the right format/place for this.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>WHAT'S NEURONPEDIA?</strong></h3><p>Neuronpedia is an AI safety game that documents and explains neurons (and <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Qryk6FqjtZk9FHHJR/sparse-autoencoders-find-highly-interpretable-directions-in\">features found with Sparse Autoencoders</a>) in modern AI models. It aims to be the Wikipedia for interpreting AI models, where the contributions come from users playing a game. Neuronpedia also wants to connect the general public to AI safety, so it's designed to not require any technical knowledge to play.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>OBJECTIVES</strong></h3><ol><li>Crowdsource AI interpretability to help build safer AI (\"Geoguessr for AI\")</li><li>Increase public engagement, awareness, and education in AI safety</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>LONG TERM VISION</strong></h3><p>Anyone can upload their LLM, and then Neuronpedia does <i>all the interpretability work: </i>generate activation texts, make features/directions, generate explanations, collect human/player explanations, scoring explanations, and produce/export all the data via an API or to files. Basically, a one stop shop for interpretability.</p><ul><li>Neuronpedia is not that far off from this, feature-wise. We have done every part of those tasks, but haven't built the tooling to do them all in one streamlined process.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>STATUS</strong></h3><ul><li>Neuronpedia's v1.0 is ready for public release and will be posted in more places in the coming days.</li><li>During the beta period, we collected 3,000+ explanations from players, over half of which beat GPT-4's explanations, when scored using OpenAI's <a href=\"https://github.com/openai/automated-interpretability\">Automated Interpretability</a>. Over 500 votes have been collected, and over 2,000 explanations have been verified.</li><li>Initially only explaining neurons, Neuronpedia now also has features/directions found with Sparse Autoencoders, thanks to researchers <a href=\"https://github.com/HoagyC/sparse_coding/tree/main\">Hoagy Cunningham, Logan Riggs, and Aiden Ewart</a>.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>WHAT YOU CAN DO</strong></h3><ol><li><strong>Play @ </strong><a href=\"https://neuronpedia.org/\"><strong>neuronpedia.org</strong></a> - you can log in with email, Apple, Google, or GitHub.</li><li><strong>Tell a friend</strong> - even those who are not interested in AI.</li><li>Give feedback, ideas, and ask questions.</li><li><strong>Join Discord</strong> - <a href=\"https://discord.gg/kpEJWgvdAx\">https://discord.gg/kpEJWgvdAx</a>&nbsp;</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>FEATURES</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Pixel-based role-playing game</strong> complete with graphics/animations, leveling up, equipment, potions, etc.</li><li><strong>Explain Mode</strong> - View activations for a neuron/feature and explain them.</li><li><strong>Dig Mode</strong> - Verify the accuracy of explanations.</li><li><strong>In-game Shop</strong> - Earning \"Bones\" (in-game currency) by playing Dig Mode lets you buy stuff like colorful hats for you and your character's pet, etc.</li><li><strong>Leaderboard</strong> - Compete against other players.</li><li><strong>Mobile Optimized</strong> - Play on the bus or when you're having trouble falling asleep from AI nightmares.</li><li><strong>Sharing / Summary</strong></li><li><strong>View Data</strong> - Anyone can browse the current results, vote, and even comment on neurons/features: <a href=\"http://neuronpedia.org/gpt2-small\">http://neuronpedia.org/gpt2-small</a>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Test New Activations</strong> - You can test new activation texts for every neuron/feature.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>MOST SIGNIFICANT FLAWS</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Scoring</strong> - OpenAI's Automated Interpretability is good, but it often doesn't take context of tokens into account. For example, if the highest scoring token of the top 20 activations are the word \"cat\" in the fragments \"blue cat\", \"white cat\", \"black cat\", the highest scoring explanation <i>should</i> be \"cat with a color before it\" - but often times the explanation \"the word 'cat'\" will have a higher score.<ul><li>Solution 1: Train a model specific to scoring that also look at scoring. This is a work in progress - we have enough activations/explanations that we can do this.</li><li>Solution 2: User scoring. This is implemented via \"Dig Mode\" in the game, but I haven't had time to connect it to the \"Explain Mode\" to complete the loop of generating a score. Also, it's asynchronous, so it doesn't immediately give the user feedback.</li><li>Solution 3: Regex or other non-AI based scoring. This was suggested by player duck-master, but I haven't had time to figure out the details or implement it.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Polysemanticity</strong> - I'm grateful for the features/directions from Hoagy/Logan/Aiden - they are less polysemantic than neurons - but they're limited in number (~3000 non-dead features, ~800 of those are somewhat low activating) due to our lack of GPU resources and their lack of time. I believe that more compute can result in even better features.</li><li><strong>Onboarding is lacking / rough</strong> - there should be a much more graceful transition in difficulty for the game from onboarding to the real game - e.g, give users some fake puzzles first so they can get the hang of it.<ul><li>Solution: Fairly straightforward to do this but haven't had time.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Optimizing for Fun vs Usefulness </strong>- Building a game around what AI safety researchers need has been a tough but interesting challenge. In a pure game, your only objective is to get the player glued to the screen, and you can adjust whatever you like to make this happen - for example, you could generate thousands of really easy puzzles (e.g, angry birds, clicker games) that make the player feel good. Word games like Wordle have a definite solution, making \"winning\" more satisfying/fair. For Neuronpedia, the difficulty is that there is not a \"right answer\", or you won't get the best answer, or the scoring/results will seem unfair.<ul><li>Solution - There's a lot to say here, but I'm optimistic and have seen that tweaking gameplay using a bit of creativity/cleverness can overcome these problems. Also - there are some very involved players who are happy to contribute to AI safety even if the game isn't as engaging as Zelda or Mario.</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>WHAT'S NEXT FOR NEURONPEDIA</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Features </strong>(other than the ones mentioned in \"flaws\" sections above)<ul><li>Data / ML<ul><li>Let anyone upload their own LLMs</li><li>Let anyone upload their own features/directions</li><li>More and Better Models, Layers, Directions/Features</li></ul></li><li>Game<ul><li>New Game Types/Modes - PvP, teams, contests, etc<ul><li>Turn other Interp needs into new game modes</li></ul></li><li>Weekly Summary and other notifications</li><li>Character / Profile Refresh</li><li>Challenges / Contests</li><li>Achievements</li><li>Unlockables (robes, shoes, gloves, wands, etc)</li></ul></li><li>General<ul><li>Code cleanup/backend optimizations/fixes</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Funding </strong>- Neuronpedia's three-month EA grant runs out soon.

Image source .</figcaption></figure><p>Louise Gl\u00fcck, one of my favorite poets, died yesterday.</p><p>I took a writing workshop with her back in 2009. I remember the force and precision of her words as she spoke, slowly, in class. There was a feeling like stones falling, one by one, into place. Like something large was being built, steadily, in simple movements, and you could see it forming.</p><p>I remember, too, a meeting in her office. It was early in the semester, and she hadn\u2019t liked my poem. She wanted me to write from some place closer to where dreams come from \u2013 something deeper and more inchoate, some raw edge. She wanted what she had called, in my memory, a \u201creal poem.\u201d</p><p>I read various of her poems in that class, but the book of hers that has most stayed with me, and mattered most to me, came out later, in 2014: \u201c<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Faithful-Virtuous-Night-Louise-Gl%C3%BCck/dp/0374535779\">Faithful and Virtuous Night</a>.\u201d I associate this book, in particular, with the dream-like quality of many of the poems \u2014 the way they shift underneath you as you read, full of quiet mystery and surprise. Here\u2019s one of my favorites:</p><blockquote><p><i>A Foreshortened Journey</i></p><p>I found the stairs somewhat more difficult than I had expected and so I sat down, so to speak, in the middle of the journey. Because there was a large window opposite the railing, I was able to entertain myself with the little dramas and comedies of the street outside, though no one I knew passed by, no one, certainly, who could have assisted me. Nor were the stairs themselves in use, as far as I could see. You must get up, my lad, I told myself. Since this seemed suddenly impossible, I did the next best thing: I prepared to sleep, my head and arm on the stair above, my body crouched below. Sometime after this, a little girl appeared on the top of the staircase, holding the hand of an elderly woman. Grandmother, cried the little girl, there is a dead man on the staircase! We must let him sleep, said the grandmother. We must walk quietly by. He is at that point in life at which neither returning to the beginning nor advancing to the end seem bearable; therefore, he has decided to stop, here, in the midst of things, though this makes him an obstacle to others, such as ourselves. But we must not give up hope; in my own life, she continued, there was such a time, though that was long ago. And here, she let her granddaughter walk in front of her so they could pass me without disturbing me.</p><p>I would have liked to hear the whole of her story, since she seemed, as she passed by, a vigorous woman, ready to take pleasure in life, and at the same time forthright, without illusions. But soon their voices faded into whispers, or they were far away. Will we see him when we return, the child murmured. He will be long gone by then, said her grandmother, he will have finished climbing up or down, as the case may be. Then I will say goodbye now, said the little girl. And she knelt below me, chanting a prayer I recognized as the Hebrew prayer for the dead. Sir, she whispered, my grandmother tells me you are not dead, but I thought perhaps this would soothe you in your terrors, and I will not be here to sing it at the right time.</p><p>When you hear this again, she said, perhaps the words will be less intimidating, if you remember how you first heard them, in the voice of a little girl.</p></blockquote><p>Why do I love this poem? I wish I could say more directly. It feels like its touching, in me, that raw edge. Something about the journey, the unexplained staircase, preparing to sleep, the grandmother\u2019s understanding. \u201cIn my own life, she continued, there was such a time.\u201d And the little girl\u2019s simple depth. \u201cThen I will say goodbye now.\u201d</p><p>The little girl, especially, has stayed with me, as have a few other similarly dream-like figures \u2013 the conductor in \u201c<a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poetrymagazine/poems/56626/aboriginal-landscape\">Aboriginal Landscape</a>,\u201d the old woman in \u201c<a href=\"https://www.threepennyreview.com/a-sharply-worded-silence/\">A Sharply Worded Silence</a>,\u201d the concierge in \u201c<a href=\"https://www.theparisreview.org/poetry/7214/the-denial-of-death-louise-gluck\">The Denial of Death</a>.\u201d The backdrop of these poems is often ethereal and unstable. It seems one way, then smoothly un-seems. \u201cRight now you are a child holding hands with a fortune-teller,\u201d Gl\u00fcck writes in \u201c<a href=\"https://connectere.wordpress.com/2016/02/18/theory-of-memory-by-louise-gluck/\">Theory of Memory</a>.\u201d \u201cAll the rest is hypothesis and dream.\u201d</p><p>See, in \u201cAboriginal Landscape,\u201d the way the speaker\u2019s relationship to the cemetery evolves.</p><blockquote><p>The cemetery was silent. Wind blew through the trees;<br>I could hear, very faintly, sounds of\u200a weeping several rows away,<br>and beyond that, a dog wailing.<br><br>At length these sounds abated. It crossed my mind<br>I had no memory of \u200a\u200abeing driven here,<br>to what now seemed a cemetery, though it could have been<br>a cemetery in my mind only; perhaps it was a park, or if not a park,<br>a garden or bower, perfumed, I now realized, with the scent of roses\u2009\u2014<br>douceur de vivre filling the air, the sweetness of\u200a living,<br>as the saying goes. At some point,<br><br>it occurred to me I was alone.<br>Where had the others gone,<br>my cousins and sister, Caitlin and Abigail?<br><br>By now the light was fading. Where was the car<br>waiting to take us home?</p></blockquote><p>And yet the figures the speaker encounters have some kind of elusive understanding, like the grandmother\u2019s on the staircase. Here, for example, is the conductor:</p><blockquote><p>Finally, in the distance, I made out a small train,<br>stopped, it seemed, behind some foliage, the conductor<br>lingering against a doorframe, smoking a cigarette.<br><br>Do not forget me, I cried, running now<br>over many plots, many mothers and fathers\u2009<i>\u2014</i><br><br>Do not forget me, I cried, when at last I reached him.<br>Madam, he said, pointing to the tracks,<br>surely you realize this is the end, the tracks do not go further.<br>His words were harsh, and yet his eyes were kind;<br>this encouraged me to press my case harder.<br>But they go back, I said, and I remarked<br>their sturdiness, as though they had many such returns ahead of them.<br><br>You know, he said, our work is difficult: we confront<br>much sorrow and disappointment.<br>He gazed at me with increasing frankness.<br>I was like you once, he added, in love with turbulence.<br><br>Now I spoke as to an old friend:<br>What of \u200ayou, I said, since he was free to leave,<br>have you no wish to go home,<br>to see the city again?<br><br>This is my home, he said.<br>The city\u2009\u2014\u2009the city is where I disappear.</p></blockquote><p>And here\u2019s the old woman in \u201cA Sharply Worded Silence\u201d:</p><blockquote><p>When I was young, she said, I liked walking the garden path at twilight<br>and if the path was long enough I would see the moon rise.<br>That was for me the great pleasure: not sex, not food, not worldly amusement.<br>I preferred the moon\u2019s rising, and sometimes I would hear,<br>at the same moment, the sublime notes of the final ensemble<br>of&nbsp;<i>The Marriage of Figaro</i>. Where did the music come from?<br>I never knew.<br><br>Because it is the nature of garden paths<br>to be circular, each night, after my wanderings,<br>I would find myself at my front door, staring at it,<br>barely able to make out, in darkness, the glittering knob.<br><br>It was, she said, a great discovery, albeit my real life.</p></blockquote><p>\u201cMy real life.\u201d How do you discover your real life? How do you write a real poem? Part of it, for Gl\u00fcck, is gazing, and speaking, with frankness. Forthright, and without illusions.</p><p>People call her poetry \u201caustere\u201d and \u201cterse.\u201d She has, one senses, no time for bullshit. From \u201c<a href=\"https://poems.com/poem/october-section-i/\">October</a>\u201d:</p><blockquote><p>It is true there is not enough beauty in the world.<br>It is also true that I am not competent to restore it.<br>Neither is there candor, and here I may be of some use.</p></blockquote><p>But what she strips away in pursuit of candor leaves something luminous. She is direct, but not dry. Indeed, in her hands, simple words take on strange power. \u201c<a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49606/early-december-in-croton-on-hudson\">I want you</a>.\u201d \u201c<a href=\"http://caladesishore.com/dpc/Poets/LouiseGluck/PurpleBathingSuit.html\">You are all that is wrong with my life and I need you and I claim you</a>.\u201d \u201c<a href=\"https://voetica.com/poem/9608\">It\u2019s not the earth I\u2019ll miss, it\u2019s you I\u2019ll miss</a>.\u201d</p><p>Here\u2019s another of my favorites:</p><blockquote><p><i>The Wild Iris</i></p><p>At the end of my suffering<br>there was a door.<br><br>Hear me out: that which you call death<br>I remember.<br><br>Overhead, noises, branches of the pine shifting.<br>Then nothing. The weak sun<br>flickered over the dry surface.<br><br>It is terrible to survive<br>as consciousness<br>buried in the dark earth.<br><br>Then it was over: that which you fear, being<br>a soul and unable<br>to speak, ending abruptly, the stiff earth<br>bending a little. And what I took to be<br>birds darting in low shrubs.<br><br>You who do not remember<br>passage from the other world<br>I tell you I could speak again: whatever<br>returns from oblivion returns<br>to find a voice:<br><br>from the center of my life came<br>a great fountain, deep blue<br>shadows on azure seawater.</p></blockquote><p>I\u2019ve returned, especially, to that line in the last stanza: \u201cfrom the center of my life came a great fountain.\u201d And to that seawater. Is that the great discovery? The poem speaks of a door at the end of suffering. Was there, somewhere, a glittering knob?</p><p>The other Gl\u00fcck poem that has really stayed with me is <a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/49759/vespers-in-your-extended-absence-you-permit-me\">this one</a>, from a series where she sometimes speaks to God from her garden.</p><blockquote><p><i>Vespers</i></p><p>In your extended absence, you permit me<br>use of earth, anticipating<br>some return on investment. I must report<br>failure in my assignment, principally<br>regarding the tomato plants.<br>I think I should not be encouraged to grow<br>tomatoes. Or, if I am, you should withhold<br>the heavy rains, the cold nights that come<br>so often here, while other regions get<br>twelve weeks of summer. All this<br>belongs to you: on the other hand,<br>I planted the seeds, I watched the first shoots<br>like wings tearing the soil, and it was my heart<br>broken by the blight, the black spot so quickly<br>multiplying in the rows. I doubt<br>you have a heart, in our understanding of<br>that term.

And then that last line, that taking-it-on. \u201cI am responsible for these vines.\u201d She loves the earth, and it causes her such pain.

(Perhaps: in a fortune-teller\u2019s tent, holding hands, with all the rest as mere hypothesis.) She quotes Dickinson as an example of this intimacy: \u201cI\u2019m Nobody! Who are you? Are you \u2013 Nobody \u2013 too? Then there\u2019s a pair of us! Don\u2019t tell!\u201d Gl\u00fcck admits to wanting readers.

Perhaps it is a stretch to say that Gl\u00fcck\u2019s is \u201cspiritual\u201d poetry. But she appears, on the page, as fiercely alive and attuned, in a world simultaneously dreamlike and raw, mythical and mundane.</p><p>How do you honor someone who has lived the way Gl\u00fcck, in her poetry, appears to live?

Recent news coverage<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflrh5hawnszk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlrh5hawnszk\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;has highlighted that the fight against malaria has stalled, and even reversed in some areas.

This is especially true if the organization releasing the gene drive does not have support from the local government.</li><li><strong>The first version of any gene drive released into the wild is unlikely to cause complete eradication</strong> because mosquitoes may become resistant (either through natural or nuclease-induced mutations).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefm5xy0zrr4gc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnm5xy0zrr4gc\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;<strong>Therefore, updated gene drive versions will likely be required to overcome resistance</strong>. The number of potential gene drive target sites in the mosquito genome is big enough that I don\u2019t think this will stop eradication, <strong>unless gene drives are banned after the first release due to public backlash</strong>.</li><li>As a corollary, a temporary drop in malaria due to a partially effective gene drive, followed by resurgence due to resistance, <strong>could lead to even more deaths</strong> because humans would lose protective antibodies against malaria over time.</li><li>Gene drives also have the opportunity to eradicate other pathogens such as <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/dengue/index.html\">dengue fever</a> (spread by <i>Aedes</i> mosquitoes) and <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/parasites/schistosomiasis/index.html\">schistosomiasis</a>, and <strong>if they are banned, this opportunity will be wasted.</strong></li></ul><p>Basically, this means that <strong>any organization releasing gene drives needs to ensure they are not banned. </strong>This would be difficult for a private organization, as influencing public opinion on GMOs is hard. However, if a government did this, it could simply choose not to ban gene drives (though it would need to remain firm against possible international pressure).</p><p>With that out of the way, I want to explore the technical details of gene drive construction, and describe what it would take for a moderately-well-equipped biology lab to build one targeting <i>Anopheles gambiae</i>. I emphasize that this is still a <strong>draft</strong> plan, and although I am skilled in molecular biology, I am not a mosquito specialist. But given the immense amount of death and suffering caused by malaria, I hope that the information I provide can help bring an end to this menace, by highlighting that <strong>political concerns, not technical challenges, are the main barriers to gene drive deployment.</strong></p><h2>How to make a gene drive</h2><p>First, I want to thank <a href=\"https://www.imperial.ac.uk/people/a.drcrisanti\">Andrea Crisanti</a> and his lab, not only for developing <i>Anopheles</i>-targeting gene drives, but also for making many of the technical details (including DNA sequences and mosquito editing methods) publicly available. This plan closely follows their strategy for making a gene drive.</p><p>There are three main steps: first, constructing the gene drive DNA; second, integrating it into mosquitoes; and third, releasing the mosquitoes into the wild.</p><h3>The DNA</h3><p>In 2020, the Crisanti lab reported <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0508-1\">a highly effective <i>doublesex </i>X-shredder gene drive</a>, and helpfully, they published <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MT270141\">the DNA sequence for it.</a> Note that it may be possible to make improvements on this gene drive,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefku19y8hp3f\"><sup><a href=\"#fnku19y8hp3f\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;but the overall process will be very similar regardless of which gene drive version is used.</p><p>The basic structure of the gene drive is shown in Figure 1 of <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41587-020-0508-1\">the paper describing it</a>:</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F290457f0-0ecf-42df-b3f4-85c9ac728756_936x46.png\"><img src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F290457f0-0ecf-42df-b3f4-85c9ac728756_936x46.png\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F290457f0-0ecf-42df-b3f4-85c9ac728756_936x46.png 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F290457f0-0ecf-42df-b3f4-85c9ac728756_936x46.png 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F290457f0-0ecf-42df-b3f4-85c9ac728756_936x46.png 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F290457f0-0ecf-42df-b3f4-85c9ac728756_936x46.png 1456w\"></a></p><p>The key functional parts are the SpCas9 nuclease driven by the germline-specific <i>vas/zpg </i>promoter,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvqhb8uiquil\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvqhb8uiquil\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;the I-PpoI nuclease<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefk7o6zr56je8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnk7o6zr56je8\">[6]</a></sup></span>driven by the male germline-specific <i>Beta2 </i>promoter,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefg9dewgho96\"><sup><a href=\"#fng9dewgho96\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and a guide RNA, driven by the constitutive U6 promoter.

First, they performed a CRISPR knock-in of a small \u201clanding pad\u201d sequence containing <i>attP</i> recognition sites for \u03c6C31 integrase, as well as GFP under control of an eye-specific promoter<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefaugewxuukzl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnaugewxuukzl\">[10]</a></sup></span>, into the <i>doublesex </i>gene. Next, they performed recombinase-mediated cassette exchange using a \u03c6C31 integrase plasmid and the gene drive plasmid, which contains <i>attB </i>sites that the \u03c6C31 enzyme recombines with the <i>attP</i> sites that were added in the first step. To follow this approach, we<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefuglt7i1g0o\"><sup><a href=\"#fnuglt7i1g0o\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;will need four plasmids:</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MT270141\">The gene drive plasmid</a> or a smaller version without fluorescence proteins</li><li>The \u03c6C31 integrase plasmid (a <i>Drosophila </i>version can be <a href=\"https://www.addgene.org/26290/\">obtained from Addgene</a>, which will likely work in mosquitoes too)</li><li>The <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MH541846\">landing pad plasmid</a>.</li><li>A Cas9/sgRNA plasmid for knocking in the landing pad.

I got a quote from Genscript for $5600 to synthesize the smaller version of the gene drive plasmid, and $6500 for the larger version with the fluorescent proteins. If money is very tight, it would be cheaper to order the plasmid in smaller fragments and combine them using Gibson assembly. In this case, the DNA would cost approximately $900 for the small version and $1100 for the large version, although labor costs would be considerably higher.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0hbdn20c93tt\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0hbdn20c93tt\">[13]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;In any case, assembling these plasmids, growing them in bacteria, and preparing DNA for injection will require only bachelor\u2019s degree-level molecular biology work, one to two months of time, and at most $25,000 in DNA, reagents, and lab equipment.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefuqdvek31y5g\"><sup><a href=\"#fnuqdvek31y5g\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Things will start getting more expensive in the next step.</p><h3>The Mosquitoes</h3><p>This project will require a mosquito breeding facility. If we have a permit, we can <a href=\"https://www.beiresources.org/Catalog/BEIVectors/MRA-763.aspx\">obtain <i>Anopheles </i>mosquitoes from a research repository</a>, but I\u2019m going to assume this will take place in an African country where we can catch mosquitoes from the wild as a backup option.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3n2tige9cyh\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3n2tige9cyh\">[15]</a></sup></span></p><p>For some weird reason,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpvhpmznwds\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpvhpmznwds\">[16]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;the International Atomic Energy Agency <a href=\"https://www.iaea.org/resources/manual/guidelines-for-standardised-mass-rearing-of-anopheles-mosquitoes-version-10\">publishes a 44-page guide on <i>Anopheles </i>mosquito husbandry.</a> It covers quite a lot of details, including how to collect mosquitoes from the wild, how to build breeding cages, how to set up feeding stations (with sugar water, and cow blood for females after mating), and how to prevent common problems such as ant infestations. It also includes a list of references for more information on particular steps.</p><p>For even more detail, we can look at the comprehensive 408-page \u201c<a href=\"https://www.beiresources.org/Portals/2/VectorResources/2016%20Methods%20in%20Anopheles%20Research%20full%20manual.pdf\">Methods in <i>Anopheles </i>Research</a>\u201d published by the American Type Culture Collection and the NIH (chapters 1\u20134 are relevant for mosquito breeding, and it also covers mosquito microinjection). This also has a catalog of entomology suppliers, which will be very useful. The basic three-week breeding cycle is as follows:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Friday</strong>: Blood-feed adult females. The mosquitoes should be a minimum of two days post-emergence for the best results.</p><p><strong>Monday</strong>: Insert the egging dish into the cage.</p><p><strong>Tuesday</strong>: Remove the egg dish from the cage. Bleach the eggs and store them in a humid sealed cup overnight.</p><p><strong>Wednesday</strong>: Rinse eggs into pans for hatching and feed.</p><p><strong>Friday</strong>: Split the larvae into pans based on the number you will need but keeping in mind proper densities. Add yeast to a final concentration of 0.02% w/v and a very small amount of the larval diet you will use.</p><p><strong>Sunday</strong>: Feed the larvae a volume of ground diet based on their size and density. If there are too many larvae in the pan, thin or split into more trays to ensure no crowding occurs.</p><p><strong>Monday through Wednesday</strong>: Continue splitting/thinning and feeding the pans daily as needed. It is best if the density at this point is the same as the final density; crowding slows development.</p><p><strong>Wednesday through Friday</strong>: Pupae should be collected daily and transferred to a cup with clean water and placed into a new cage with a sugar source.</p><p><strong>Friday of the following week</strong>: Bloodfeed the adults to initiate the cycle again.</p></blockquote><p>I\u2019m not going to do a detailed calculation of how much it would cost to build a mosquito breeding facility, but I\u2019d roughly estimate somewhere around $100,000 in equipment (not counting the building itself), and two employees to run it. The time required to get it up and running would probably be around 6 months of intense work, which could be done in parallel with the plasmid preparations.</p><h3>Editing and Release</h3><p>Although setting up a breeding facility will be operationally difficult, the most technically challenging part of this whole project will be doing the actual mosquito editing. Fortunately, the Crisanti group published <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22990807/\">a helpful guide on how to inject DNA into mosquito eggs to perform editing.</a> This is all explained pretty well in the guide (they even include catalog numbers of key equipment to buy), and I don\u2019t have much to add here. The following equipment will be required (prices are from suppliers):</p><ul><li>Inverted fluorescence microscope (roughly $10,000 including light filters)</li><li>Microinjector (roughly $10,000)</li><li>Micromanipulator (roughly $2,500)</li><li>Microinjection pipettes (roughly $500)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefglo0ebfcugk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnglo0ebfcugk\">[17]</a></sup></span></li><li>as well as miscellaneous inexpensive equipment<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefo9fz84ohkra\"><sup><a href=\"#fno9fz84ohkra\">[18]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(probably another $5,000)</li></ul><p>I\u2019d estimate the total equipment cost to be roughly $28,000. After obtaining the equipment, the basic steps are to:</p><ol><li>Collect freshly laid mosquito eggs</li><li>Line up the eggs on a microscope slide</li><li>Inject the DNA using a microinjector<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefe0ap7piveql\"><sup><a href=\"#fne0ap7piveql\">[19]</a></sup></span></li><li>Grow the mosquitoes and screen for successful transformants</li></ol><p>It will probably take a few months of practice to get right, and it would be a good idea to practice using a simple plasmid to make the embryos express GFP, before moving on to more complicated editing. We will need to do two rounds of editing: one to introduce the <i>attP</i> \u201clanding pad\u201d and another to swap out the \u201clanding pad\u201d for the gene drive. Then, we will need to breed gene drive mosquitoes. This could be a bit annoying due to the tendency of the gene drive to crash populations, so we will need a good supply of females to expand the numbers. Because of the PpoI nuclease X-shredder design, we will know our gene drive is working when all the larvae are males. Releasing <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-022-28419-0\">a few thousand males</a> would be sufficient to introduce the gene drive allele into the local population. Mosquitoes lay about 100 eggs each and the breeding cycle is 3 weeks long, so starting from a single edited mosquito it would take only a few months to breed the required numbers. I\u2019d estimate another 6 months for this phase of the project if everything goes perfectly \u2013 which it probably won\u2019t, so maybe 12 months is more realistic.</p><h3>Post-Release Monitoring</h3><p>After releasing the gene drive, we will need to check for resistance in order to develop updated drives to defeat the resistance. This will involve capturing mosquitoes from the wild (assuming there are any left), extracting their DNA, and sequencing it. PCR amplification of the target site, followed by Sanger sequencing, should be sufficient to test for resistant alleles at the target site at a cost of about $5 per sample. For larger numbers of samples, we could do the PCR in a barcoded format, pool samples, and do next-generation sequencing. This could scale very well (approximately 1 cent per sample, assuming batches of 250,000) but would require a larger upfront cost. Still, at this point the bigger cost would be collecting mosquitoes.</p><p>It\u2019s also possible that resistance could arise due to mutations elsewhere in the genome, so if we observe that mosquito populations are rebounding, we should perform whole genome sequencing, at a cost of about $500 per sample.</p><p>Post-release monitoring may actually be the most expensive part of the project, because if the gene drive works, it will spread internationally, requiring collection of mosquitoes from a large area. Monitoring should continue until eradication is achieved, which may take a few years depending on mosquito migration rates.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdav53ovzog\"><sup><a href=\"#fndav53ovzog\">[20]</a></sup></span></p><h3>Public Relations</h3><p>Since people will eventually find out about this project (even if it\u2019s initially secret, they\u2019ll notice when mosquitoes start disappearing), it\u2019s best to take a proactive stance on public relations to mitigate backlash. <strong>This will be equally, if not more, important in comparison with the rest of the project</strong>, since we really want to avoid getting gene drives banned. Non-gene-drive transgenic mosquito technology has been accepted in several countries,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhs5cye5zhg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhs5cye5zhg\">[21]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and an important part of this was convincing people of the benefits. We should emphasize the project\u2019s potential to end the vast amount of death and suffering caused by malaria. As a top scientist of Target Malaria <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/29/health/mosquitoes-genetic-engineering.html\">recently expressed in a news article:</a></p><blockquote><p>We may not know what may happen but we know what is happening today: 600,000 people dying of malaria, and we need to fix it,\u201d said Dr. Diabat\u00e9, the principal investigator in Burkina Faso for Target Malaria, a project backed by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. \u201cWe can\u2019t say we are afraid of the future so we will accept 600,000 people dying. <strong>We make good progress as a society when we invest in our dreams, rather than our fear.</strong>\u201d</p></blockquote><h2>A call for political action</h2><p>Overall, I think this gene drive could be built and released for under a million dollars (considering equipment and salaries), although a budget of a few million would allow the project to move faster by hiring more people. Of course, the reason this is so cheap is that the R&amp;D costs have already been paid by the Crisanti lab and others. <strong>I want to emphasize that releasing a gene drive, without having the R&amp;D capacity to make a followup drive in the likely case that the first drive is insufficient, will be doing more harm than good. </strong>So, realistically this would be a multi-million dollar project.</p><p><strong>But I also want to emphasize that this is well within the capabilities of most African governments! </strong>Just to pick a random sub-Saharan country, <a href=\"https://mofep.gov.gh/publications/budget-statements\">the national revenue of Ghana</a> is about 65 billion Ghana Cedi, or $5.5 billion USD at October 2023 exchange rates.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrwyszbzwbpo\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrwyszbzwbpo\">[22]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Funded at $5 million per year, this would be about 1/1000 of total government revenue \u2013 and I\u2019m sure the Ghanaian government could get some foreign support if it asked.

Thermal energy from a detonation will therefore be distributed over a hypothetical sphere that surrounds the detonation point. If the sphere's area is larger in direct proportion to the yield of a detonation, then the amount of energy per unit area passing through its surface would be unchanged. The radius of this hypothetical sphere varies as the square root of its area. Hence, the range at which a given amount of thermal energy per unit area is deposited varies as the square root of the yield.</p></blockquote><p>Presumably, <a href=\"https://pubs.aip.org/physicstoday/article/61/12/37/393240/Environmental-consequences-of-nuclear-warA\"><u>Toon 2008</u></a>&nbsp;assumes the burned area is defined by this range, and therefore it is proportional to yield (since a circular area is proportional to the square of its radius). With respect to this, Bean <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Ysq53coRwgSWHHz2x/nuclear-winter-scepticism\"><u>said</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p>Nor is the assumption that burned area&nbsp;will scale linearly with yield a particularly good one.

And their claims of low wind speed are erroneous, as they choose wind speeds higher than typically observed in Atlanta. Real-world experience with firestorms such as in Hiroshima or Hamburg during World War II or in San Francisco after the 1906 earthquake (London, 1906), and of conflagrations, such as after the bombing of Tokyo during World War II (Caidan, 1960), suggests that a 40-minute mass fire is a dramatic underestimate; most of these fires last for many hours. A longer fire would make available more heat and buoyancy to inject soot to higher altitudes. If their fire had a short duration, and did not simply blow off their grid, it was likely due to the low fuel load assumed in their target area and combustion that did not consume all of the available fuel.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019JD031281\"><u>Reisner 2019</u></a>&nbsp;replied that:</p><blockquote><p>Another important point concerning these simulations is that the rapid burning of the fine fuels leads to both a reduction in oxygen that limits combustion and a large upward transport of heat and mass that stabilizes&nbsp;the upper atmosphere above and downwind of the firestorm. These dynamical and combustion processes help limit fire activity and BC production once the fine material has been consumed (timescale &lt; 30 min). Hence, the primary time period for BC injection that could impact climate occurs during a relatively short time period compared to the entirety of the fire or the continued burning and/or smoldering&nbsp;of thicker fuels.</p><p>[...]</p><p>While the full duration is not modeled, we argue that the primary atmospheric response from a nuclear detonation is the rapid burning of the fine fuels. Thick fuels will take longer to burn but will induce less atmospheric response and produce and inject less BC to upper&nbsp;atmosphere. Further, during the later time period, the upper atmosphere stabilizes&nbsp;from the large injection of heat and mass. Firestorms such as Dresden were maintained not only by burning of thick fuels but also by the injection of highly flammable fuel from the incendiary bombs, which we believe acted as fine fuel replacement.</p></blockquote><p>In&nbsp;any case, it still seems to me <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2019JD030777\"><u>Robock 2019</u></a>&nbsp;might have a valid point:</p><ul><li>From the legend of Figure 6 of <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017JD027331\"><u>Reisner 2018</u></a>, the soot emissions in the rubble case for 40 min are 1.32 (= 3.16/2.39) times those for 20 min, so it is not obvious that soot emissions after 40 min would be negligible.</li><li>From Figure 7, soot continues to be injected into the stratosphere in the climate simulation (run after the fire simulation), which means soot not injected into the stratosphere in the 1st 40 min can still do it afterwards.

Numerous studies have shown that sensible and latent heat release is essential to lofting smoke in either firestorms (e.g., Penner et al., 1986) or conflagrations (Luderer et al., 2006). Reisner et al. stated \u201cA dry atmosphere was utilized, and pyrocumulus impacts or precipitation from pyro-cumulonimbus were not considered. While latent heat released by condensation could lead to enhanced vertical motions of the air, increased scavenging of soot particles by precipitation is also possible. These processes will be examined in future studies using HIGRAD-FIRETEC.\u201d By not considering pyrocumulonimbus clouds, which by the latent heat of condensation can inject soot into the stratosphere, they have eliminated a major source of buoyancy that would loft the soot. They seem to suggest that any lofting of soot would be balanced by significant precipitation scavenging, but there is no evidence for that assumption. In fact, forest fires triggered pyrocumulonimbus clouds that lofted soot into the lower stratosphere in August 2017 over British Columbia, Canada. Over the succeeding weeks, the soot was lofted many more kilometers, as observed by satellites, because it was heated by the Sun (Yu et al., 2019). This fire is direct evidence of the self-lofting process Robock et al. (2007) and Mills et al. (2014) modeled&nbsp;before. It also shows that precipitation in the cloud still allowed massive amounts of smoke to reach the stratosphere.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019JD031281\"><u>Reisner 2019</u></a>&nbsp;replied that:</p><blockquote><p>The latent heat release may or may not lead to enhanced smoke lofting depending on the complex microphysical and mesoscale processes. Robock et al. (2019) cite wildfires in extremely dry conditions that prevent precipitation formation and do not model the process. Precipitation scavenging of BC can be much higher than is currently assumed (20%) (Yu 2018). We and the community agree that research is needed to quantify the role latent heat plays in BC movement and washout.</p></blockquote><p>Meanwhile, <a href=\"https://romps.berkeley.edu/papers/pubdata/2021/water/21water.pdf\"><u>Tarshish 2022</u></a>&nbsp;concluded:</p><blockquote><p>Direct numerical and large-eddy simulations indicate that dry firestorm plumes possess temperature anomalies that are less than the requirements for stratospheric ascent by a factor of two or more. In contrast, moist firestorm plumes are shown to reach the stratosphere by tapping into the abundant latent heat present in a moist environment. Latent heating is found to be essential to plume rise, raising doubts about the applicability of past work [namely, <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017JD027331\"><u>Reisner 2018</u></a>&nbsp;and <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019JD031281\"><u>Reisner 2019</u></a>] that neglected moisture.</p></blockquote><p>Nonetheless, as hinted by <a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2019JD031281\"><u>Reisner 2019</u></a>, moisture not only helps the emitted soot reach the stratosphere, but it also contributes to it being rained out. This latter process is not modelled in <a href=\"https://romps.berkeley.edu/papers/pubdata/2021/water/21water.pdf\"><u>Tarshish 2022</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p>A limitation of the theory and simulations presented here is the absence of soot microphysics. Soot aerosols provide cloud condensation nuclei that may alter the drop size distribution and impact auto-conversion. This aerosol effect is expected to invigorate convection (Lee et al., 2020), lofting the plume higher. Coupling soot to microphysics, however, also enables soot to rain out, which could remove much of the soot from the rising plume as suggested in Penner et al. (1986). Given the essential role of moisture in lofting firestorm plumes we identified here, future research should investigate how these second-order microphysical effects impact firestorm soot transport. Another aspect not addressed here and deserving of future study is the radiative lofting of plumes, which has been observed to substantially lift wildfire plume soot&nbsp;for months after the fire (Yu et al., 2019).</p></blockquote><h3>Available fuel</h3><p><strong>Available&nbsp;fuel for counterforce</strong></p><p>For counterforce, I calculated an available fuel per burned area&nbsp;of 3.07 g/cm^2 (= (11*10^6*2.06*10^3 + 8*10^9)*10^(-5*2)).

The people whose lives were saved thanks to resilient food solutions would go on to eat factory-farmed animals, which may well have sufficiently bad lives for the decrease in human mortality to cause net suffering.

Nonetheless, my estimate is not <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/credal-resilience\"><u>resilient</u></a>, so I am mostly agnostic with respect to saving random human lives. There is also a potentially dominant beneficial/harmful <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vBcT7i7AkNJ6u9BcQ/prioritising-animal-welfare-over-global-health-and%23Wild_animals\"><u>effect</u></a>&nbsp;on wild animals.</p><p>Accordingly, I am uncertain about whether decreasing famine deaths due to the climatic effects of nuclear war would be beneficial or harmful. I think the answer would depend on the country, with saving lives being more beneficial in (usually low income) countries with lower consumption per capita of farmed animals with bad lives. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vBcT7i7AkNJ6u9BcQ/prioritising-animal-welfare-over-global-health-and%23Farmed_animals\"><u>I calculated</u></a>&nbsp;the cost-effectiveness of saving lives in the countries targeted by GiveWell\u2019s top charities only decreases by 22.4 % accounting for negative effects on farmed animals, which means it would still be beneficial (0.224 &lt; 1).</p><p>Some hopes would be:</p><ul><li>Resilient food solutions mostly save lives in countries where there is low consumption per capita of animals with bad lives.</li><li>The conditions of animals significantly improving, or the consumption of animals with bad lives majorly decreasing in the next few decades<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwmfk66iz43\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwmfk66iz43\">[71]</a></sup></span>, before an eventual nuclear war starts.</li><li>The decreased consumption of animals in high income countries during the 1st few years after the nuclear war persisting to some extent<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsjkz3tv0zji\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsjkz3tv0zji\">[72]</a></sup></span>.</li></ul><p>Bear in mind price-, taste-, and convenience-competitive plant-based meat <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/iukeBPYNhKcddfFki/price-taste-and-convenience-competitive-plant-based-meat\"><u>would not</u></a>&nbsp;currently replace meat.</p><p>Another downside I am not too worried about is the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_hazard\"><u>moral hazard</u></a>&nbsp;of preparing for the climatic effects of nuclear war. This would tend to increase the probability of a large nuclear war, and number of offensive nuclear detonations conditional on its occurrence. In the survey (S) and Anders Sandberg\u2019s (E) model of <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212420922000176\"><u>Denkenberger 2022</u></a>, it is guessed such hazard would only decrease longterm cost-effectiveness by 4 % and 0.4 % for a full scale nuclear war, and 2 % and 0.04 % for a 10 % agricultural shortfall, thus not making preparation harmful. I intuitively agree the moral hazard would not be a major effect. Nonetheless, I welcome further research like that of <a href=\"https://www.cser.ac.uk/media/uploads/files/Poll-final.pdf\"><u>Ingram 2023</u></a>, which investigated the public awareness of nuclear winter, and its implication for escalation control<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjqy4xtejcwj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjqy4xtejcwj\">[73]</a></sup></span>.</p><h3>Longterm&nbsp;perspective</h3><p>It is somewhat unclear to me whether generally mitigating the food shocks caused by nuclear war would change values for the better.

More importantly, nationally mitigating food shocks would be harmful not only in pessimistic cases, but also in expectation in 40.7 % (= 59/145) of the countries I analysed. \u201cAll results should be taken with a big grain of salt, as they rely on quite <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jBEyb8akFGzbADokR/future-benefits-of-mitigating-food-shocks-caused-by-abrupt%23Speculative_assumptions\"><u>speculative assumptions</u></a>\u201d, but I would still say the sign of the longterm impact is unclear.</p><p>It also looks like there is a potential trade-off between maximising nearterm and longterm effects. Saving lives in low income countries is tendentially cheaper, and consumption per capita of animals with bad lives is lower there. Nonetheless, to the extent GDP per capita is a good proxy for influence per person on the longterm future, targeting high income countries <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/SZZdYwYvkJjus2vGp/increase-in-future-potential-due-to-mitigating-food-shocks\"><u>may</u></a>&nbsp;be better if reducing famine there does&nbsp;lead to sufficiently better democracy levels or <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/transformative-artificial-intelligence\"><u>TAI</u></a>, and is sufficiently cheap.</p><p>Nevertheless, resilient food solutions potentially having a beneficial impact on the longterm future via would not automatically render the uncertainty around the nearterm effects irrelevant.

In any case, none of these potential sources of error lead in an obvious way to underestimating/overestimating the fuel load, as it is a weighted mean. The potential error is also very much bounded, as the lowest and highest fuel loads are 0.427 (= 7.08/16.6) and 1.64 (= 27.3/16.6) times my estimate of 16.6 g/cm^2.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fni0vbf8vocr\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefi0vbf8vocr\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;\u201cWe use the LandScan (2003) population density database as a fuel-loading database\u201d.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnqx3o2hmzpd\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefqx3o2hmzpd\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;Year closest to 2003 for which The World Bank <a href=\"https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/AG.LND.TOTL.UR.K2\"><u>has</u></a>&nbsp;data on urban land area.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnbednckc3rq6\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefbednckc3rq6\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;\u201cFor a 15-kt explosion [what was analysed], we assume the fire zone area is equal to that of the Hiroshima firestorm \u2013 13 km2 \u2013 ignited by a weapon of about the same yield\u201d.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnmswosy9yf\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefmswosy9yf\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;Arguably a good model if the countervalue detonations target city centres.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnor7qrlykn3o\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefor7qrlykn3o\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\begin{align*} \\rho_R &amp;= \\frac{1}{\\pi\\,R^2}\\,\\int_{0}^{R}\\int_{0}^{2\\,\\pi}{\\rho_0\\,e^{-\\lambda\\,r}\\,r\\,d\\theta\\,dr} = \\frac{2\\,\\pi\\,\\rho_0}{\\pi\\,R^2}\\,\\int_{0}^{R}{r\\,e^{-\\lambda\\,r}\\,dr} \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{2\\,\\rho_0}{R^2}\\,\\left(-\\frac{R\\,e^{-\\lambda\\,R}}{\\lambda} + \\int_{0}^{R}{\\frac{e^{-\\lambda\\,r}}{\\lambda}\\,dr}\\right) = \\frac{2\\,\\rho_0}{R^2}\\,\\left(-\\frac{R\\,e^{-\\lambda\\,R}}{\\lambda} - \\frac{e^{-\\lambda\\,R}}{\\lambda^2} + \\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}\\right) \\\\ &amp;= \\frac{2\\,\\rho_0}{\\lambda\\,R^2}\\,\\left(\\frac{1}{\\lambda} - e^{-\\lambda\\,R}\\,\\left(R + \\frac{1}{\\lambda}\\right)\\right)\\;. \\end{align*}\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mtable\" style=\"vertical-align: -4.083em;

To explain, if there is a probability of p_1 and p_2 that ln(X_i) is no larger than ln(x_i_1) and ln(x_i_2), the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_score\"><u>z-scores</u></a>&nbsp;of these are z_1 = (ln(x_i_1) - E(ln(X_i)))/V(ln(X_i))^0.5 and z_2 = (ln(x_i_2) - E(ln(X_i)))/V(ln(X_i))^0.5. Consequently, z_2 - z_1 = (ln(x_i_2) - ln(x_i_1))/V(ln(X_i))^0.5, i.e. V(ln(X_i)) = (ln(x_i_2/x_i_1)/(z_2 - z_1))^2.

In other words, going from 8 billion people to 800 million is as bad as going from that to 80 million, and so on. Analogously, marginal increases in wealth leading to marginal increases in welfare which are inversely proportional to wealth (and proportional to the increase in wealth) implies that going from 1 k$/year to 10 k$/year is as good as going from 10k$/year to 100 k$/year. If roughly all longterm value is lost in the process of going from 8 billion to 800 people, there would be an absolute reduction of 1/7 (= 1/log<sub>10</sub>(8*10^9/800)) of the initial longterm value for each decrease by a factor of 10 of the population. So 90 %, 99 % and 99.9 % population losses would imply a decrease in longterm value of 14.3 % (= 1/7), 28.6 % (= 2/7), and 42.9 % (= 3/7). The assumption of the longterm value of saving lives being inversely proportional to population size is informed by the following passage of Carl Shulman\u2019s <a href=\"https://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2018/10/flow-through-effects-of-saving-life.html\"><u>post</u></a>&nbsp;on the flow-through effects of saving a life:</p><blockquote><p>For example, suppose one saved a drowning child 10,000 years ago, when the human population was <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estimates_of_historical_world_population\"><u>estimated</u></a>&nbsp;to be only in the millions. For convenience, we'll posit a little over 7 million, 1/1000th of the current population. Since the child would add to population pressures on food supplies and disease risk, the effective population/economic boost could range from a fraction of a lifetime to a couple of lifetimes (via children), depending on the frequency of famine conditions. Famines were not annual and population fluctuated on a time scale of decades, so I will use 20 years of additional life expectancy.</p><p>So, for ~ 20 years the ancient population would be 1/7,000,000th greater, and economic output/technological advance. We might cut this to 1/10,000,000 to reflect reduced availability of other inputs, although increasing returns could cut the other way. Using 1/10,000,000 cumulative world economic output would reach the same point ~ 1/500,000th of a year faster. An extra 1/500,000th of a year with around our&nbsp;current population of ~7 billion would amount to an additional ~14,000 life -years, 700 times the contemporary increase in life years lived. Moreover, those extra lives on average have a higher standard of living than their ancient counterparts.</p><p>Readers familiar with Nick Bostrom's paper on <a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste\"><u>astronomical waste</u></a>&nbsp;will see that this is a historical version of the same logic: when future populations will be far larger, expediting that process even slightly can affect the existence of many people.

I can assure you that this is a deeply unpleasant experience that you want to avoid.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/akSr4YXHKZcK8EnQe/qackqopiqefufpnuiw1m\" alt=\"A screenshot of a computer screen\n\nDescription automatically generated\"><br><i>US bank failures by year, NYT</i></p><p>This year, we\u2019ve seen the failures or severe distress of Silicon Valley Bank, First Republic, Credit Suisse, and Metro Bank, among others. While these banks were rescued with no losses to depositors, that\u2019s not guaranteed. Bank runs do happen, banks do fail, and deposit insurance generally is intended to protect small depositors (up to $250k in the US, \u00a385k in the UK).</p><p>One solution is to have at least two bank accounts. They should be linked so that you can easily transfer money from one to the other in case trouble brews. It\u2019s a good idea for one bank to be a \u201c<a href=\"https://www.fsb.org/wp-content/uploads/P211122.pdf\"><u>systematically important financial institution</u></a>\u201d, colloquially \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d, like JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup, HSBC, or other banks that governments are likely to protect. If you must put all your eggs in one basket, choose a good basket (a strong major bank) and watch that basket (via news alerts or market observables). Wise and PayPal are not banks - operating out of Wise can be practical, but please keep most deposits at a regulated bank.</p><p>Opening a new bank account can take ~10 hours of staff time spread over a few months, as banks can be slow. Open a bank account before you definitely need one; in periods of banking stress, everyone is trying to open new bank accounts. Banks collapse quickly (often on the weekend after they encounter distress), and it typically takes weeks to open an account.</p><h1><strong>Invest your cash in a government guaranteed money market account, earning ~5%</strong></h1><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/akSr4YXHKZcK8EnQe/cvd2yf9urzkrstjxtfsf\" alt=\"A graph showing a growing trend\n\nDescription automatically generated with medium confidence\"><br><i>US average interest rates, FRED</i></p><p>From the Fed, we can see the average checking account (current account) earns 0.07% interest, the average savings account earns 0.45%, and the average money market account earns 5.33%. For years, checking accounts and money market accounts all earned 0%, so most organizations opened a checking account, which was the easiest. Now if you open the right checking account and check the \u201csweep to money market\u201d box, you earn 76x the interest. Check the box. It\u2019s free money.</p><p>There are other advantages to having your money in a money market account. If you have $1mm in your savings account:</p><ol><li>you can\u2019t write checks out of it</li><li>you earn 0.45% interest</li><li>if the bank fails, the FDIC covers $250k</li></ol><p>If you have $1mm in your checking account, with a daily sweep into a money market fund:</p><ol><li>you can write a $1mm check out of your account \u2013 the account is usually \u201cfully checkable\u201d</li><li>you earn 5.33% interest</li><li>if the bank fails, the money market account is backed by US government bonds, and you get all your money back</li></ol><p>You earn $48,800 more a year, you don\u2019t need to juggle money out of checking and into savings, and you\u2019re insulated from bank failures. This seems like a free lunch. It is. You make $48,800 more a year because (roughly) your bank makes that much less.</p><p>\u201cSweeping\u201d means that each day, excess cash is taken from your checking account and invested overnight, in this case by lending it to the US government. You get it back the next morning. Many organizations choose to sweep amounts over a peak daily spend (often payroll), to keep some cash in the checking account, but many money market accounts are \u201cfully checkable\u201d \u2013 you can write checks out of them for the full amount. Sweeping doesn\u2019t require a separate brokerage account setup or manually moving money into savings / a fund. However, occasionally, a restricted grant may require income from that grant to also be restricted, which may create incremental paperwork. Different banks may offer different rates on their money market accounts: I think it\u2019s not usually worth it to switch banks to chase an extra 0.2% - 0.4%.&nbsp;</p><p>Money market accounts are widely offered by reputable banks, primarily to their corporate clients.&nbsp;<strong>Recently, an OP grantee spent 5 hours of staff time opening this&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.chase.com/business/banking/checking/platinum-business-checking\"><strong><u>Chase Platinum Business Checking account</u></strong></a><strong> which swept into this&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://am.jpmorgan.com/us/en/asset-management/adv/products/jpmorgan-u-s-treasury-plus-money-market-fund-morgan-4812c2726\"><strong><u>JPMorgan US Treasury Plus Money Market Fund</u></strong></a><strong>. This makes them ~$40,000 more per month.</strong> YMMV based on your cash balances, but this is real and ongoing free money. Currently, sweep accounts are in demand and may take a while to open.</p><p>Most US money market funds by assets (<a href=\"https://www.financialresearch.gov/money-market-funds/us-mmfs-investments-by-fund-category/\"><u>~77% / $4.7tn</u></a>) are invested in government bonds, and are designated \u201cgovernment\u201d, \u201cfederal\u201d, or \u201ctreasury\u201d. I recommend these, as \u201cprime\u201d money market funds may invest in bank debt and make you exposed to bank failures again. \u201cTax exempt\u201d funds are generally unsuitable for organizations. It\u2019s normal for a bank to offer sweeps into money market funds managed by other institutions, often Fidelity, Vanguard, or JPMorgan. I recommend selecting among funds with at least $10bn under management, and choosing the highest available \u201cSEC yield\u201d. Equivalent vehicles also exist for EUR and GBP.</p><h1><strong>Hold FX in the same proportions as your spending</strong></h1><p>Suppose your organization spends 60% in USD, 20% in EUR, and 20% in GBP. If GBP has the best interest rate, should you keep all your cash in GBP? No, this has (approximately) 0 expected value by no arbitrage /&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interest_rate_parity\"><u>covered-interest rate parity</u></a>. By concentrating your holdings in GBP, you\u2019re exposing your organization to GBP/USD and GBP/EUR foreign exchange risk: if the pound weakens by 7% (~1 standard deviation), you now have an unnecessary 7% shortfall for your USD and EUR spending.</p><p>The best practice is to hold FX in the same proportions as your spending in those currencies. That way, if a currency strengthens, your costs and the balance you\u2019re holding to cover those costs both strengthen, and vice versa. This implies that if you are a UK organization with GBP expenses and you receive a USD grant, it\u2019s in your best interest to convert it to GBP immediately.</p><p>Note: this holds for major market currencies (USD, GBP, EUR) without capital controls or pegs. If you have expenses in an emerging market currency, it may be better to hold the equivalent cash in a major market currency, since it may be the case that:</p><ol><li>it\u2019s very difficult to maintain an EM currency bank account that earns interest, so it\u2019s practically better to hold it in a major market currency</li><li>because of capital controls, the EM currency steadily devalues</li><li>the currency is pegged to another, for example HKD to USD, so it\u2019s practically easier to hold the major currency</li></ol><p>If your organization has minor proportional (&lt;10%) or absolute spending in any currency, the above advice does not apply. The operational costs of maintaining a local currency bank account typically exceed the costs from having unhedged currency exposure.&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Watch out for FX fees</strong></h1><p>FX fees are mostly hidden. FX providers routinely advertise \u201cno fees\u201d but make money by giving you a terrible rate. I have encountered FX costs ranging from 0.01% (awesome!) to 12% (terrible) for major currency pairs. You can\u2019t manage what you don\u2019t measure. Once you calculate the FX fees, you can comparison-shop for lower fees.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/akSr4YXHKZcK8EnQe/xjpzfeuqbzqp4vrhp06v\" alt=\"A screenshot of a currency account\n\nDescription automatically generated\"> <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/akSr4YXHKZcK8EnQe/leckmv8qcwhsuvsbmsrw\" alt=\"A screenshot of a currency account\n\nDescription automatically generated\"><br><i>Calculating foreign exchange cost on Wise</i></p><p>Suppose you\u2019re trying to understand the fees for converting USD to GBP through a certain provider. Plug in $1,000 USD, and see how much GBP you get. In the case of Wise, at the moment, you receive \u00a3813.59 GBP. Now plug that \u00a3813.59 GBP back in, and see how much USD you would receive - $986.22. You can see that for a round trip USD to GBP to USD transaction, you are paying $1000 - $986 = $14, or 1.4%.</p><p>That implies a 0.7% cost for a one-way transaction. For the same transaction ($1,000 from USD to GBP), PayPal charges 4.6%, Chase charges 3.5%, Wise charges 0.7%, and a brokerage account charges 0.2%. Rates are somewhat cheaper for large transactions: moving $1,000,000 to GBP on Wise costs 0.4% instead. For many charities,&nbsp;<strong>using Wise or Monzo for FX transactions is the low hanging fruit</strong>. For example, if you receive a EUR grant into your USD account, you pay the 3+% bank rate, but you can set up Wise to auto-convert and transfer to the USD account. If your program costs are in a different currency than your granted funds, moving away from a traditional bank can save you 3% of all program costs. If you have large FX volume, it may be worthwhile to open a brokerage account to allow you to further cut your FX fees.&nbsp;</p><p>For most charities, I expect implementing these four best practices will be cheap and worthwhile.

Introduction</strong> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</h1><p>A central challenge for cause prioritization in EA concerns choices between interventions to benefit&nbsp;one species rather than another. Can we achieve the most good by investing in malaria nets, cage-free campaigns for chickens, or to more humanely kill farmed shrimp? These choices present unique challenges when assessing&nbsp;cost-effectiveness, for they require that we find some way to compare interspecies measures of well-being. This is especially challenging when considering species for which we have little knowledge of whether members are sentient and how much they are able to suffer or enjoy. How, then, should we choose between helping humans versus shrimp or chickens versus mealworms?</p><p>A typical way of evaluating relative cost-efficiency is to calculate the expected value of actions of comparable cost.&nbsp;For each, we consider the value of the possible outcomes of that action, weighted by the probability of those outcomes obtaining if the action is performed. In the context of interspecies comparisons, determining the expected value (EV) of an action includes assessing the probability that the individuals it affects are sentient.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9zotisdmpwh\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9zotisdmpwh\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;As Sebo (<a href=\"https://jeffsebodotnet.files.wordpress.com/2018/09/the-moral-problem-of-other-minds.pdf\"><u>2018</u></a>) puts one (strong) version of the view, \u201cwe are morally required&nbsp;to multiply our degree of confidence that they are sentient by the amount of moral value that they would have if they were, and to treat the product of this equation as the amount of moral value that they actually have\u201d. To simplify matters, for an action A affecting species S<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7a9kb2k6ks9\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7a9kb2k6ks9\">[2]</a></sup></span>, we will assume that:</p><blockquote><p>EV(A) = Pr(S is sentient) x V(A given that S is sentient) + Pr(S is not sentient) x V(A given that S is not sentient)</p></blockquote><p>As we will see, using EV maximization to make cross-species comparisons robustly favors actions to benefit numerous animals of dubious sentience, that we ought to reinvest (perhaps all of our) money away from malaria nets or corporate campaigns to end confinement cages in pig farming and toward improving the lives of the teeny, teeming masses. Many will find this result, which Sebo (<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21550085.2023.2200724\"><u>2023</u></a>)&nbsp;dubs \u201cthe rebugnant conclusion\u201d, implausible at best and morally abhorrent at worst.</p><p>One way of avoiding the problem is to continue to use EV maximization to guide our actions but to give extra value to the suffering of humans and other large animals. However, this seems to us to embody an unmotivated and arbitrary bias in favor of some species over others. Instead, we explore three alternatives to EV maximization that incorporate sensitivity to risk. While one form of risk aversion lends even more support to actions favoring numerous animals of dubious sentience, the other two forms favor actions that benefit humans and other large animals. This result is valuable in its own right, showing how there are reasonable decision procedures that avoid the result that we ought to benefit small invertebrates. It also serves as a case study in how <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/13SCTWfpixNmZbDkmCA6vJGxFU0034-0il9C6grMFkek/edit\"><u>EV maximization can go wrong</u></a>&nbsp;and how sensitivity to risk can significantly affect our decision-making.</p><h1><strong>2. Results of EV maximization</strong></h1><p>It is an interesting fact about our world that animals with low probabilities of sentience tend to be more numerous than animals with high probabilities of sentience. The same holds among farmed animals, so it is easier to enact interventions that affect large numbers of the former. As a result,&nbsp;there is a strong negative correlation between the probability of S\u2019s sentience and the consequences of our actions for aggregative&nbsp;well-being&nbsp;if S is sentient.</p><p>For example,&nbsp;it is estimated that 300 million cows, 70 billion chickens (not including egg-laying hens), 300-620 billion <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/shrimp-the-animals-most-commonly-used-and-killed-for-food-production\"><u>shrimp</u></a>, and upwards of a trillion <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/insects-raised-for-food-and-feed\"><u>insects</u></a>&nbsp;are killed each year for agricultural purposes. While the probability that insects or shrimp are sentient is much lower than for other species, as we can see, the number of individuals that would be affected by our actions may be orders of magnitude larger. Likewise, even if we assume that sentient insects or shrimp would experience less suffering or enjoyment, and therefore that the value of wellbeing enhancements will be smaller than for other animals<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrlyl8ldxp2\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrlyl8ldxp2\">[3]</a></sup></span>, the sheer number of individuals affected threatens to overcome this difference.&nbsp;As a result, EV maximization seems to suggest that we should very often prioritize numerous animals of dubious sentience (the many small) over large animals of more probable sentience (the few large).</p><p>For example<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreft5gio1zdg7\"><sup><a href=\"#fnt5gio1zdg7\">[4]</a></sup></span>, consider&nbsp;an action that would benefit 100 million farmed shrimp. Before the intervention, each shrimp\u2019s life contains -.01 units of value, and the action would increase this to 0. Compare this to an action of similar cost that would benefit 1000 humans and would increase each individual\u2019s value from 10 to 50. Assume that the affected humans are certainly sentient, and the probability that shrimp are sentient is .1.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9j008a3mun\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9j008a3mun\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>To calculate the expected value of these actions and of doing nothing, we add up the value of shrimp lives and the value of human lives that would result from our action if shrimp are sentient and multiply this by the probability that shrimp are sentient. We add this to the value that results if shrimp are not sentient (0 shrimp value + whatever human value results), multiplied by the probability that they are not sentient. We get the following:</p><blockquote><p><strong>EV(Do nothing)</strong>=0.1(-1,000,000 shrimp + 10,000 human) + 0.9(0 shrimp + 10,000</p><p>human) = -90,000</p><p><strong>EV(Help Shrimp)</strong>= 0.1(0 + 10,000) + 0.9(0 + 10,000) = 10,000</p><p><strong>EV(Help humans)</strong>= 0.1(-1,000,000 + 50,000) + 0.9(0 + 50,000) = -50,000</p></blockquote><p>Thus, even if we assume that shrimp have a low probability of sentience<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3a1o2n81uyu\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3a1o2n81uyu\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and can only experience small improvements in welfare, actions toward shrimp can have much higher EV than actions toward humans. If we choose our actions based on what maximizes EV, then we should very often prioritize helping the many small over the few large. If this conclusion is unacceptable, then either we have misjudged the values or probabilities we used as inputs to our EV calculations or there is something wrong with using EV maximization to make these decisions. &nbsp;</p><h1><strong>3. Dissatisfaction with results of EV maximization</strong></h1><p>The moral decision procedure used above makes most sense within welfare consequentialist theories<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefoedry94fscj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnoedry94fscj\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;that (a) ground value in subjective experiences of sentient creatures, (b) require us to maximize total value, and (c) for which units of value are additive and exchangeable.</p><p>Moral frameworks that ground value in other properties, such as rationality or relationships, will be less likely to favor benefits for the many small.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3rx8lvycixf\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3rx8lvycixf\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;For example, a Kantian who places moral value&nbsp;on rationality (strictly interpreted) will find much less value in the lives of shrimp or insects.&nbsp;A&nbsp;contractualist that places value on certain relations among individuals will think that the human world contains significant sources of additional value.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzw74ar5beuo\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzw74ar5beuo\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Likewise for moral frameworks in which units of value are not exchangeable. For example, on Nussbaum\u2019s (<a href=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Justice-for-Animals/Martha-C-Nussbaum/9781982102500\"><u>2022</u></a>) capabilities approach, justice&nbsp;requires that all individuals achieve some threshold level of various capacities, and losses to one individual or species cannot be compensated for by benefits to another.</p><p>Among those sympathetic to the EV maximization decision procedure, including (we suspect)&nbsp;many EA proponents, there is a different, perhaps quite common, response. We have assumed that interspecies expected value comparisons will be impartial, in the sense that all well-being or hedonic experience is equally valuable, regardless of who experiences it. Though a human might have suffering that is more intense, or arises from different sources, or is longer-lasting than that of a shrimp, a given amount of suffering does not matter more just because a human is experiencing it.</p><p>In contrast, hierarchicalist views give more weight&nbsp;to the well-being or hedonic experiences of some species over others, even if&nbsp;their phenomenal experiences are identical.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxlcrctt302g\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxlcrctt302g\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Species weights act as a multiplier on values.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9ojljklb8u\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9ojljklb8u\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;We will denote the&nbsp;weight for a species S as w<strong><sub>s</sub></strong>. For example, you might think that human pain matters 10x&nbsp;more than shrimp pain, which you can represent with a w<strong><sub>shrimp</sub></strong>&nbsp;of 1 and a w<strong><sub>human</sub></strong>&nbsp;of 10.&nbsp;In that case, the EVs of candidate actions become:</p><blockquote><p><strong>EV(Help Shrimp) = 0</strong>.1[0(w<sub>shrimp</sub>) &nbsp;+ 10,000(w<sub>human</sub>)] + 0.9[0(w<sub>shrimp</sub>) + 10,000(w<sub>human</sub>)]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 0.1[0(1) + 10,000(10)] + 0.9[0(1) + 10,000(10)]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; = 100,000</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>EV(Help humans) = 0.</strong>1[-1,000,000(w<sub>shrimp</sub>) + 50,000(w<sub>human</sub>)] + 0.9[0(w<sub>shrimp</sub>) +</p><p>50,000(w<sub>human</sub>)]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;= 0.1[-1,000,000(1) + 50,000(10)] + 0.9[0(1) + 50,000(10)]</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;= 400,000</p></blockquote><p>As we see, giving higher weight to humans&nbsp;can cause actions benefiting&nbsp;humans to have higher expected value than those benefiting&nbsp;lower animals.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3fqs7wch4h8\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3fqs7wch4h8\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>However, we doubt that there are good justifications for hierarchicalism&nbsp;in general or&nbsp;for particular choices of weights.&nbsp;A first problem is that a choice of weight seems arbitrary. Even if humans matter more than shrimp, do they matter 2x more? 10x more? 100x more?&nbsp;It is hard to see how to answer this question in an objective way. If a choice of weights is unconstrained, different agents will be free&nbsp;to choose whichever weights will reproduce their own pre-theoretic judgments about cases.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefisufxmkraj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnisufxmkraj\">[13]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Second, hierarchicalism holds that two identical phenomenal experiences could have different value, depending on who experiences them. If you think that value is largely grounded in the experiences of sentient creatures \u2013 the painfulness of their pain, the pleasure of their pleasure \u2013 then hierarchicalism will look like no more than an expression of bias, not something grounded in any real, morally relevant differences. By analogy, many people would likely place a much higher weight on the experiences of dogs than pigs, but it is unclear what could motivate this other than mere speciesism.</p><h1><strong>4. Risk</strong></h1><p>We think that there is a way to reject the conclusion that we ought to prioritize helping the many small over the fewer large&nbsp;that does not make questionable metaphysical assumptions about the relative value of humans and other animals. To make things as friendly as possible to the argument for the many small, we will assume that all well-being matters equally and that what we ought to do is a function of the well-being that would result.</p><p>The change we will make is to permit some <i>risk aversion</i>, rather than requiring strict value maximization. Decision-makers often make choices that violate expected value (including utility) maximization because they are risk averse. That is, they are willing to accept a gamble that has a surer chance of a good outcome but lower expected value than a higher expected value bet for which good outcomes are less certain. We suggest that some reasonable risk attitudes that are sensitive to probabilities of sentience generate decision profiles that strongly resemble hierarchicalist views favoring humans and higher animals but rest on a much more justified basis.</p><p>However, \u201crisk aversion\u201d, as loosely characterized, above can be realized by (at least) three distinct attitudes: a desire to avoid the worst-case outcomes; a desire to make a positive difference; and a desire to act on&nbsp;known over unknown probabilities. The first kind of risk aversion makes the case for helping numerous creatures of dubitable sentience even better. The second and third undermine it.</p><h1><strong>5. Risk aversion as avoiding&nbsp;worst case outcomes</strong></h1><h2>5.1. Risk aversion about outcomes</h2><p>One kind of common risk aversion places more weight on the worst case outcomes and less weight on better case outcomes. For example, suppose that money does not have diminishing returns for you, such that you value every dollar equally, at least for the dollar amounts involved in the following bet.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefovn0ezuesep\"><sup><a href=\"#fnovn0ezuesep\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I offer you a bet that pays you $200 if a fair coin lands heads and takes $100 from you if it lands tails. Since the E$V of this bet is .5(200)+.5(-100) =50 and the E$V of refusing the bet is 0, EVM recommends taking the bet. However, if you are risk averse, you might decline this bet; the chance of taking a loss of this magnitude is not compensated for by an equal chance of a greater return of that magnitude.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the probabilities and values of various outcomes, formal accounts of risk aversion add a <i>risk-weighting </i>function, showing how much more decision weight is given to worst case over better case outcomes. Even if two agents agree on all of the relevant probabilities and outcome&nbsp;values, they may still differ with respect to how much they care about avoiding the lowest value outcomes versus obtaining higher value outcomes.</p><p>What does this kind of risk aversion say about the choice to benefit numerous animals of dubious sentience versus benefitting fewer animals of more certain sentience? When comparing these two actions (here, actions to benefit shrimp or people), there are&nbsp;two&nbsp;states of the world that are relevant:</p><ul><li>shrimp are sentient and are suffering in enormous numbers</li><li>shrimp are not sentient, and money spent on them would otherwise spare a small number of human children from premature death</li></ul><p>The worst-case outcome here is that shrimp are sentient and suffering in enormous numbers. If we are risk averse, in the sense proposed here, then we will put <i>even more </i>weight on shrimp suffering than we otherwise would.</p><h2>5.2. A formal model of risk aversion about outcomes</h2><p>We can see how incorporating risk matters by using a risk-adjusted decision theory. Different formal theories incorporate&nbsp;risk aversion&nbsp;in different ways. For example, Buchak\u2019s (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/9439\"><u>2013</u></a>) Risk-Weighted Expected Utility (REU) theory ranks outcomes from worst to best and introduces risk as a function of an outcome\u2019s probability, with better outcomes getting a lower share of the probability weight. Bottomley and Williamson\u2019s (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/phpr.13006\"><u>2023</u></a>) Weighted-Linear Utility Theory introduces risk&nbsp;as a function of utility, with lower utility outcomes receiving more weight&nbsp;than higher utility outcomes.</p><p>For ease of explication<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8iygw9jz8e8\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8iygw9jz8e8\">[15]</a></sup></span>, we will use REU to evaluate how risk aversion, in this sense, affects one\u2019s decisions in light of uncertainty about sentience. Above, we calculated the EV of an action by a weighted average of the value of its outcomes:</p><span><span class=\"mjpage mjpage__block\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml MJXc-display\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"EV(A)=\\sum_{x\\in X}p_A(x)v(x)\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em;

Shrimp would be favored for&nbsp;even lower probabilities of sentience and smaller benefits for shrimp well-being. In effect, it embodies a \u201cbetter safe than sorry\u201d approach that treats shrimp sentience&nbsp;as more probable than it is in order to avoid scenarios with immense amounts of suffering.</p><h1><strong>6. Risk aversion as avoiding inefficacy</strong></h1><p>Expected value maximization dictates that we often ought to accept predictable losses if the upside is worth it.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefci7111yq8vf\"><sup><a href=\"#fnci7111yq8vf\">[16]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Putting more weight on worst case outcomes can lead us to accept even higher probabilities of loss. However, there is another kind of risk attitude that we think is both prevalent and undertheorized, and which tells against the kind of predictable losses inherent in gambles on lower animal welfare. &nbsp;</p><h2>6.1. Difference-making risk aversion</h2><p>Imagine that Jane, a major player in philanthropic giving, is convinced by the expected value maximization argument. She withdraws millions of dollars of funding for programs that decrease (human) child malnutrition and redirects them toward improving conditions at insect farms. Her best estimate of the probability that the insects are sentient is .01. However, the vast number of insect lives she can affect outweighs the sure thing of helping a smaller number of humans.</p><p>One might reasonably protest: but you are almost certain that your money is doing absolutely nothing! There is only a 1% chance that the world is better as a result of your action, and a 99% chance that you have thrown away millions of dollars. On the other hand, if you had given to child malnutrition, you could be certain that sentient creatures\u2019 lives improved as a result of your action. That is a massively risky thing that you did!</p><p>Here, the risk attitude in question is an aversion to <i>inefficacy</i>, to one\u2019s actions coming to naught. For a <i>difference-making risk averse</i>&nbsp;agent, in this sense, the probability that her action makes a difference matters, and it matters in such a way that decreases in the probability of difference-making do not cleanly trade-off with increases in possible payoffs. In addition to caring about the overall value her actions creates, she is also concerned with avoiding making things worse or achieving nothing with her actions.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9pnc47evih\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9pnc47evih\">[17]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Thus, she seeks some balance between maximizing utility and minimizing futility.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpib7945ebb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpib7945ebb\">[18]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><h2>6.2. The risk of wasting money on non-sentient creatures</h2><p>In the context of decision-making about species with different probabilities of sentience, an agent that is risk-averse about inefficacy will behave very similarly to a hierarchicalist who places more weight on the suffering of higher animals. However, she will do so <i>not </i>because she thinks that lower animals matter less, even if they are sentient, but because they have a lower probability&nbsp;of&nbsp;being sentient, and hence, a lower probability of mattering.</p><p>Take a ranking of species from highest probability of sentience (humans), high but intermediate (chickens), low but intermediate (fish, shrimp), to lowest (nematodes). A difference-making risk aversion&nbsp;weight is used to penalize those species for whom interventions will have a low probability of making a difference. The result is that the well-being of probably sentient&nbsp;animals will matter more for the purposes of decision-making because they reduce&nbsp;the probability of futility. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>If this kind of risk aversion is rational, then there is a reasonable&nbsp;decision-making procedure that roughly recapitulates hierarchicalism&nbsp;without committing to dubious metaphysical or ethical assumptions about the value of suffering in different creatures. There will, though, be some significant differences in the decision profiles of the futility-averse and the hierarchicalist. First, while it is possible to replicate a given hierarchical weighting with a given futility weighting, they need not be identical. For example, it might be the case that there is no plausible futility weighting that makes, say, humans a million times more important than shrimp.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref60vil0mhz9\"><sup><a href=\"#fn60vil0mhz9\">[19]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Second, since futility judgments will be directly influenced by the probability of sentience, risk weightings will be sensitive to new information about the probability of sentience&nbsp;while hierarchicalism may not be (for example, a hierarchicalist might readily accept that shrimp are sentient but still give them a very low weight).</p><p>Lastly, someone who is concerned with minimizing the risk of futility may avoid single-shot bets with a low probability of success but accept combinations of bets that collectively make success probable. A hierarchicalist would not deem the combination of gambles to be any better than the gambles individually. For example, Shane might resist spending money on shrimp welfare because he thinks that there is a .1&nbsp;chance that shrimp are sentient. However, he might accept distributing money among shrimp, honeybees, black soldier fly, mealworms, and silkworms; though he thinks each of these has a .9 chance of making no difference, he believes that the probability that the combination of bets will make a difference is .5.</p><p>If Shane\u2019s reasoning is correct, then risk aversion about efficacy might not avoid the conclusion that we ought to help the many small. Instead, it might tell us that we should distribute our money across different species of dubious sentience in order to optimize the combined probability of making a difference and maximizing value. However, there are reasons to doubt this. The probabilities of different gambles add up only when the outcomes of those gambles are independent of one another. Are facts about honeybee sentience independent of facts about black soldier fly sentience? That is, do the prospects of their sentience rise and fall together? If sentience has separately evolved in different lineages, then perhaps they are largely independent of one another. If you think that sentience is phylogenetically conserved and hard to evolve, then it is more likely that all invertebrates are sentient or that none of them are.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffi0bg23ccqs\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfi0bg23ccqs\">[20]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><h2>6.3. Is difference-making risk aversion rational?</h2><p>Difference-making risk aversion has&nbsp;received less attention than the kind of worst-case scenario risk aversion discussed above, and much of the existing discussion is quite negative about&nbsp;it. Most prominently, Greaves, <i>et al. </i>(<a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/on-the-desire-to-make-a-difference-hilary-greaves-william-macaskill-andreas-mogensen-and-teruji-thomas-global-priorities-institute-university-of-oxford/\"><u>2022</u></a>) argue that the person who is difference-making risk averse cares that <i>she </i>be the cause&nbsp;of good things, not just that good things happen; while this might add meaning to her life, her preference is ultimately about her, not the world. Thus, if what you care about is the state of the world, then you should care about maximizing expected value, not making a difference (in the event these come apart).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgs2rfpqi0je\"><sup><a href=\"#fngs2rfpqi0je\">[21]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>It might be correct that some people might give to charity because they want to be the cause of value in the world; perhaps they want the praise or psychological benefits that come with making an actual difference, not just raising the probability of a good outcome. There are also moral theories that place importance on the kind of relationship between one\u2019s actions and value. For example, if you think that there is a morally relevant difference between being the cause of something terrible and merely failing to prevent it, then there is something morally important about the difference that <i>you </i>make.</p><p>We also think there is more to be said for difference-making risk aversion&nbsp;from an agent-neutral perspective. After all, you might object to <i>Jane </i>giving all of her money to help shrimp, even if you are not causally implicated in her action. Take the status quo as the baseline state and consider 1000 possible futures. The expected value maximizer maintains that even if an action makes only 1 of these possible futures better than the status quo, that is alright as long as that 1 world is sufficiently great. An inefficacy-averse reasoner maintains that the number&nbsp;of possible futures that are better than the status quo also matters, intrinsically. It is a good thing that the future is better than&nbsp;it would have been if we failed to act, and she is willing to trade off some chances of great futures for a greater chance that the future we have will be better&nbsp;because of our actions.</p><h2>6.4. A formal model of difference-making risk aversion</h2><p>To our knowledge, there are no comprehensive normative models of difference-making risk aversion, but we can give an idea of what one would look like by modifying the REU used above.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref06b8n8wzz4bq\"><sup><a href=\"#fn06b8n8wzz4bq\">[22]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Because the risk-averse agent cares about the <i>difference </i>that an action makes, her decision procedure will not just include information about the outcomes of her action but will also take into account the difference between the states of affairs that resulted from her action and states of affairs that would have obtained had she not so acted.</p><p>Take&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"x_i\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">x</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sub\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">i</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>&nbsp;to be the value of a possible outcome of&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"A\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">A</span></span></span></span></span></span></span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span><span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"y_i\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\" style=\"margin-right: -0.006em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.225em; padding-bottom: 0.519em; padding-right: 0.006em;\">y</span></span></span><span class=\"mjx-sub\" style=\"font-size: 70.7%; vertical-align: -0.212em; padding-right: 0.071em;\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\" style=\"\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.446em; padding-bottom: 0.298em;\">i</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span><sub>&nbsp;</sub>to be the value that would obtain in that outcome if one were to do nothing.

If we care about our actions actually making a difference, then we should be leery of using resources on animals with a low probability of sentience.</p><h1><strong>7. Risk as avoiding ambiguity</strong></h1><p>Expected value calculations require utilities and probabilities as inputs. So far, we have treated the probability of sentience as reflecting our best estimate of the probability that species S has sentience. However, there are two kinds of uncertainty that might be packed into a probability assignment.</p><p>For illustration, suppose that Matt and Pat both assign a .5 probability to the proposition that a particular coin will land heads on the next flip. Matt has seen this coin flipped 1000 times and has observed that it lands hands roughly 50% of the time. Pat, on the other hand, has no information whatsoever about the coin. As far as she knows, it might be fair or biased toward heads or tails (to any extent), so her credence in heads is spread out from 0 to 1. She assigns a probability of .5, the mean of this distribution, but this is an expression of pure ignorance.</p><p>An agent who is risk averse about ambiguity or uncertainty avoids making bets where the probabilities are unknown. Suppose both Matt and Pat are ambiguity averse but otherwise risk neutral. We offer Matt and Pat a choice between the following bets:</p><ol><li>if the coin lands heads, you win $10, and if it lands tails, you lose $5 (EV = $2.5)</li><li>you win a sure thing $1 (EV = $1)</li></ol><p>Matt will accept bet 1. Pat, depending on the extent of her aversion, may opt for bet 2. Because she is averse to acting on uncertainties, Pat will favor some bets with less ambiguous probabilities and lower EV over bets with more ambiguous probabilities and higher EV.</p><p>The probabilities of sentience that we assign to shrimp or insects are not just low, they are also highly uncertain. While there is significant controversy about the correct way to assign probabilities of sentience, it is generally the case that we have better evidence and are more certain about assigning probabilities to the extent that a species is similar in certain respects to species that we know are sentient. The probability that humans are sentient is both extremely high and extremely certain. For animals like pigs or chickens, whose brains and behaviors are comparable to humans, we are confident in assigning a high probability of sentience. We are confident in assigning a low probability of sentience to rocks. However, for animals quite unlike us \u2013 animals like nematodes or mealworms \u2013 we are both uncertain that they are sentient and uncertain about how uncertain we should be that they are sentient.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3esvlazm6x9\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3esvlazm6x9\">[24]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Ambiguity aversion favors interventions toward humans and other higher animals over interventions for animals of dubious sentience. The problem is not just that shrimp have a low probability of sentience. It\u2019s that given the state of our evidence, we shouldn\u2019t be confident in any probability we assign to shrimp sentience,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref64sc02vfn13\"><sup><a href=\"#fn64sc02vfn13\">[25]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and we should resist making bets on the basis of unknown chances.</p><p>Typical EV maximization strategies deal with ambiguous probability intervals the same way it treats first-order uncertainty about outcomes.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2h615yim221\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2h615yim221\">[26]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;For example, Pat takes the probability she assigns to (the coin has a 0% chance of landing heads) and multiplies this by the value of the bet if this is correct, and so on for all probability values in her interval. Therefore, uncertainty <i>per se </i>is not penalized.</p><p>As Holden Karnofsky <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2011/08/18/why-we-cant-take-expected-value-estimates-literally-even-when-theyre-unbiased/\"><u>puts it</u></a>, \u201cthe crucial characteristic of the EEV [Explicit Expected Value] approach is that it does not incorporate a systematic preference for better-grounded estimates over rougher estimates. It ranks charities/actions based simply on their estimated value, ignoring differences in the reliability and robustness of the estimates.\u201d</p><p>According to Karnofsky, ambiguity aversion is a strong reason to reject expected value maximization calculations using ambiguous probabilities. Karnofsky focuses largely on reasons for adopting ambiguity aversion as a general strategy. First, high uncertainty gambles will often have higher EV because they reserve some probability for very high value outcomes, not because there is a good reason to think they have a real objective chance of occurring but out of ignorance. Thus, EV maximization rewards investments in high variance outcomes purely because they have high variance and punishes more targeted and more certain investments. Thus, ambiguity neutrality rewards ignorance and disincentivizes grant seekers against seeking evidence that might reduce the variance in their predicted outcomes. Lastly, assigning a probability that reflects the mean of your uncertainty gives the veneer of precision. We risk forgetting the ignorance that lies at its root. &nbsp;</p><p>Putting aside worries about perverse incentives, there are also reasons for avoiding making individual gambles involving unknown chances. In general, evidentialists&nbsp;maintain that it is irrational to act on insufficient evidence. Additionally, allowing ambiguity also makes you especially subject to <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/analysis/article-abstract/69/3/443/139950?redirectedFrom%3Dfulltext%26login%3Dfalse\"><u>Pascal\u2019s mugging</u></a>&nbsp;cases, in which tiny probabilities of astronomical values dominate expected value calculations. This threatens to undermine the \u201crebugnant conclusion\u201d but only in favor of an even more implausible result. Suppose that you are highly uncertain about whether panpsychism&nbsp;(according to which all matter has some degree of consciousness) is true, so you assign a small but non-zero chance that rocks are sentient. Because the number of rocks is enormous compared to the number of animals of uncertain sentience, perhaps we ought to devote our resources to promoting rock welfare.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnrl4r0umi4\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnrl4r0umi4\">[27]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;If you resist, on the basis that we have far better reasons for assigning non-zero probabilities to shrimp sentience than rock sentience, then you might be ambiguity averse to some degree.</p><p>How should we incorporate ambiguity aversion into our formal models of decision?<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnb35522vc2e\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnb35522vc2e\">[28]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;One method would be to simply avoid decisions for which there are poor grounds for assigning probabilities (e.g. there is scant evidence or high disagreement). Another would be to develop a model that takes into account the EV of a decision and a penalty for the amount of uncertainty in its probability assignments.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7cub668qwk8\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7cub668qwk8\">[29]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Alternatively, one might adjust ambiguous probability assignments to reduce their variance. For example, in a <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/attachments/worms.pdf\"><u>Bayesian framework</u></a>, the posterior expectation of some value is a function of both the prior expectation and evidence that one has for the true value. When the evidence is scant, the estimated value will revert to the prior.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxke2fsfxdza\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxke2fsfxdza\">[30]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Therefore, Bayesian posterior probability assignments tend to have less variance than the original ambiguous estimate, assigning lower probabilities to extreme payoffs.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefl7bl88kthk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnl7bl88kthk\">[31]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>What should an ambiguity-averse agent do when faced with decisions about helping numerous animals with low (and low confidence) probabilities of sentience versus less numerous animals with high (and high confidence) probabilities of sentience? One option is to eschew taking gambles on the former. We have better grounds for assessing the cost-effectiveness of interventions on humans than shrimp, so we should prefer these, despite the fact that they might have lower expected value.</p><p>Another option is to put resources toward <i>reducing our uncertainty </i>about the sentience of various species. We should devote resources toward research into theories of consciousness, and the brains and behaviors of far-flung species, such as shrimp, nematodes, or black soldier flies. Here, we recommend using a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CuuCGzuzwD6cdu9mo/methods-for-improving-uncertainty-analysis-in-ea-cost%233_2_Value_of_information_analysis\"><u>value of information analysis</u></a>, which allows you to determine \u201cthe price you\u2019d pay to have perfect knowledge of the value of a parameter\u201d. Given the enormous potential consequences of sentience among numerous animals, we suspect that the value of information about sentience is similarly very high.</p><h1><strong>8. What about chickens?</strong></h1><p>The expected value of an action to help a particular species will be a function of the probability that the species is sentient and the amount of welfare that would be created or suffering reduced by the intervention. The sheer number of the many small means that they will almost always have higher expected value than the few large. So far, we have been illustrating this trade-off between sentience and numerosity by selecting species with fairly extreme values of both - humans and shrimp - and showing that there are ways of rebutting the argument in favor of helping the many small even in extreme cases.</p><p>However, given that EV is a function of sentience and numerosity, we should expect that the highest EVs will be found <i>not</i>&nbsp;in species that have high values of one feature and low values of another but rather in species that have intermediate values of both. While there might be good biological explanations for why numerosity and sentience tend to be negatively correlated, this trade-off is not set in stone. Indeed, the efficiency of Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations has made it possible to create enormous populations of animals with high probabilities of sentience, such as pigs, cows, chickens, or ducks.</p><p>Here, we compare actions to benefit humans or shrimp with actions to benefit chickens. To recall, our hypothetical shrimp intervention would affect 100 million shrimp, raising them from a baseline value of -.01 to 0. A human intervention would affect 1000 people, raising them from a baseline of 10 to 50. Now consider an action to benefit chickens that would affect 1 million chickens, raising them from a baseline value of -1 to a value of 1.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnx8nnwlz3sr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnx8nnwlz3sr\">[32]</a></sup></span></p><p>While the probability that chickens are sentient is not as high as for humans, suppose that it is still quite high at .9. When calculating EVs, there are now three relevant states of the world to consider:<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffz3mp99qpyl\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfz3mp99qpyl\">[33]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Humans, chickens, and shrimp are all sentient; probability = .1</li><li>Humans and chickens are sentient, shrimp are not sentient; probability = .8</li><li>Humans are sentient.

However, actions to help chickens have a <i>much </i>higher expected value than either. Notably, this is the case before we take any risk aversion into account. Hence, this comparison provides a risk-independent reason to reject an across-the-board preference for helping the many small. Expected value comparisons may benefit fairly numerous animals of fairly high sentience, not very numerous animals of low sentience. When we add risk aversion about the worst-case outcomes (REV), chickens are still strongly favored over shrimp; the amount of suffering that occurs if chickens are sentient is also bad enough that it will also carry a lot of weight for a risk-averse agent. &nbsp;</p><p>Certainly, for some, this conclusion will be nearly as bad as the \u201crebugnant conclusion\u201d, given that it strongly recommends helping non-humans over humans. In the comparison between humans and shrimp, adding difference-making risk aversion, a higher weight on those actions that are likely to make a positive difference, to our EV calculations made a difference, reversing the preference for shrimp over humans.

However, you will also still favor chickens over humans by a significant amount, given the high probability that chicken interventions will benefit sentient creatures and the magnitude of such benefits.</p><p>Lastly, because sentience estimates for small invertebrates are highly uncertain, someone who is ambiguity averse should either favor helping humans over helping shrimp&nbsp;<i>or </i>investing in research into small invertebrate sentience.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefu8li1k5lukm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnu8li1k5lukm\">[34]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;There is more uncertainty about the probability that chickens are sentient than that humans are, but there is a smaller range of uncertainty for chicken sentience than for small invertebrates. We did not provide a formal model of ambiguity avoidance, so we aren\u2019t entirely confident here, but we doubt that the amount of ambiguity in chicken sentience will be enough to tip the scales in favor of helping humans. Likewise, there is probably more value in researching small invertebrate sentience than chicken sentience, given that resolving the smaller amount of ambiguity about the latter is unlikely to make a significant difference to overall value comparisons.</p><h1><strong>9. Conclusions</strong></h1><p>We have provided support for the following claims. For plausible estimates of welfare effects and probabilities of sentience:</p><ul><li>Risk-neutral expected value calculations favor helping extremely numerous animals of dubious sentience over humans.</li><li>Risk-aversion that seeks to avoid bad outcomes favors them even more strongly.</li><li>Risk-aversion about difference-making favors helping humans over helping extremely numerous animals of dubious sentience.</li><li>Ambiguity aversion either favors helping humans or investing in research about the sentience of extremely numerous, small animals.</li><li>Risk-neutral and both risk-adjusted (outcomes and inefficacy) expected value calculations favor very numerous animals of likely sentience (e.g. chickens) over both extremely numerous animals of dubious sentience (e.g. shrimp) and less numerous animals of certain sentience (e.g. humans).</li></ul><p>These conclusions are quite robust over ranges of risk weightings for the models of risk that we used. However, future research into the question of risk and species cause prioritization should investigate alternative models of risk aversion (e.g. <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/phpr.13006\"><u>WLU</u></a>) and formal models of ambiguity aversion. Likewise, more work needs to be done to assess both the rationality of risk attitudes and particular risk weight values.</p><p>It may also be important to extend this work to the case of digital minds. We are fast approaching (or perhaps have already arrived at) the point of having digital minds that have some probability of sentience. Digital minds will provide an even more extreme version of the kinds of trade-offs we have discussed here. If created, they will likely be <i>extremely</i>&nbsp;numerous. Determining whether AIs are sentient involves <a href=\"https://aeon.co/essays/to-understand-ai-sentience-first-understand-it-in-animals\"><u>unique epistemic challenges</u></a>, so the probabilities we assign will probably be even more ambiguous than those for animals. As Eric Schwitzgebel (<a href=\"https://www.journal.robonomics.science/index.php/rj/article/view/32\"><u>2023</u></a>) has pointed out, giving moral consideration to non-sentient AIs could have catastrophic effects (more so than simply wasting money on non-sentient shrimp). As we grapple with a new class of numerous entities of dubious sentience, it will become even more imperative to carefully think about how much risk - and what kinds of risk - we should tolerate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Acknowledgments</strong></h1><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/c5m8vAxpJgJJ2XGFu/yyzoqjvtmgntnoqgfhww\"></figure><p>The post was written by Hayley Clatterbuck.

This was a very fun and interesting reporting trip to a conference for what they call forecasting nerds, so people who like to predict the future and bet on the future.

And there was this period of maybe a week or two where people were hotly debating whether this was real or not. And we mentioned on the show the existence of something called Manifold Markets, which is a prediction-markets platform where people can go and wager fake money on real-world events. And one of the most popular markets was about LK-99. And it was a way to track, like, what the smart-money people thought was going to happen and whether this prediction of a room-temperature superconductor would pan out. Now, it did not, right? LK-99 did not turn out to be a room-temperature superconductor. But I heard from one of the founders of Manifold Markets who said, if you\u2019re interested in prediction markets, we\u2019re actually having a big conference in a few weeks in Berkeley called Manifest, and you should come report on it. And I thought, well, that sounds like a fun trip.</p><p><i>Casey Newton</i></p><p>Yeah, I\u2019d actually predicted that you were going to go to that, so that was interesting. [KEVIN LAUGHS] So you get there. And sort of describe the scene. Because what you\u2019ve described \u2014 I\u2019ll say it \u2014 sounds a little bit dull, but then I read your story, and it actually seemed like it might be a good time.</p><p><i>Kevin Roose</i></p><p>Yeah, it was a very strange event. And I say that \u2014 I had a good time and I learned a lot, but it was definitely not what I was expecting. I was expecting, like, a sort of statistics conference where people in dress shirts and Dockers would be going around, like, comparing their predictive models of the world. But it was more like a party than I thought. I described it in the article as sort of a cross between a math Olympiad and Burning Man. Like, there was actually an orgy at this conference. And I know that because there was also a prediction market asking whether or not there was going to be an orgy. I think when I got there, it was, like, 28 percent possibility, and by the time I left, someone had had an orgy and closed out the market.</p><h3>History of prediction markets</h3><p><i>Kevin Roose</i></p><p>When we talked about it on the podcast in the context of LK-99, I believe we made some snarky comments about, oh, these are just gamblers who like to bet on everything.</p><p><i>Casey Newton</i></p><p>Yeah.</p><p><i>Kevin Roose</i></p><p>But I would say, after going to this Manifest conference, there\u2019s also a real movement that I think is worth paying attention to here. Prediction markets \u2014 this is not a new idea, right? People have been betting on things like elections for centuries. Actually, in the 19th and early-20th centuries, it was common to open up the newspaper and see a sort of betting-odds breakdown of who people thought was going to win the next election.</p><p><i>Casey Newton</i></p><p>And I feel like my entire life, I\u2019ve been hearing about the wisdom of crowds.</p><p><i>Kevin Roose</i></p><p>Yes. That was a very popular idea. This idea of prediction markets was sort of revived in the 1990s by a group of economists who thought, well, markets collect information. You can bet on the price of a company\u2019s stock, or you can bet on corn futures \u2014 what will the price of corn be a year from now? You can also bet on sports games. Why can\u2019t you bet on other things? Why can\u2019t you bet about scientific discoveries? Why can\u2019t you bet about policy implementation? Why can\u2019t you bet about silly things like whether there\u2019s going to be an orgy at a statistics conference?</p><h3>On Rationalists</h3><p>So there\u2019s been sort of a real resurgence in the last few years, led by this group of people called the Rationalists. Do much about the Rationalists?</p><p><i>Casey Newton</i></p><p>A lot of it from reading your reporting, but yeah, tell us a little bit more about the Rationalists.</p><p><i>Kevin Roose</i></p><p>So Rationalists are a sort of loose collective of people who are sort of committed to examining their own beliefs. They want to get closer to the truth. Big figures in the movement are people like the guy who runs this blog, \u201cAstral Codex Ten,\u201d which used to be known as \u201cSlate Star Codex.\u201d Eliezer Yudkowsky is sort of an AI safety researcher and a prominent Rationalist blogger who started a website called \u201cLessWrong.\u201d So there\u2019s a crew of people, largely based in the Bay Area but also spread out throughout the world, who are sort of doing what they would describe as rigorous empirical testing of everything that they believe and do. They love attaching probabilities to things. So I want to sketch out the vision for what they believe prediction markets could do. Because they\u2019re not just saying like this could be a way to make money by betting right on things. They\u2019re saying, if you have everyone betting on everything, then you end up with a system where people are incentivized to understand the truth.</p><h3>Google\u2019s internal prediction markets</h3><p>But interestingly, I was told that this is not a new idea to the world of tech, that actually, Google has run its own prediction markets internally for employees. So if you worked at Google, you could bet \u2014</p><p><i>Casey Newton</i></p><p>On whether it would become a search monopoly.</p><p><i>Kevin Roose</i></p><p>[LAUGHS]: Yeah, and everyone who made that bet got paid. No, it was \u2014 they used a fake currency called googles, and you could bet on things like, will this project launch in time, or will Gmail get to this many users by this date. And the company\u2019s leaders use this as a way to gauge employee sentiment. And sort of, when people could bet anonymously, they could actually get people\u2019s true opinions.</p><p><i>Casey Newton</i></p><p>Wait, that\u2019s fascinating. And do they not do this anymore?</p><p><i>Kevin Roose</i></p><p>Well, they were playing around with this as recently as 2021. And there were people I talked to at Manifest who believed that this is ultimately how all companies should run. Like, you get a job at a company and a prediction market opens up that says, in a year, will Casey Newton be more or less successful than we expect him to? And everyone in the company would bet on whether they think you will succeed at your job or not. And over time, you would essentially see who is the best at forecasting people\u2019s performance. And you could put them in charge of your hiring process.</p><p><i>Casey Newton</i></p><p>That sounds so unbelievably stressful. [KEVIN LAUGHS] By the way, if you are really good at the Google predictions market, and so you had more googles than anyone else, and then they shut down the market and you were stuck with all these googles you couldn\u2019t use, we want to hear from you. I think that would make for a good story.</p><h3>Insider trading</h3><p>Well, the Google story is really interesting. But it brings up something else I want to ask you about, which is the potential for people to manipulate these markets, right? You set up a market, and then you either have some insider information, or you just sort of try really hard to make the thing happen.</p><p><i>Kevin Roose</i></p><p>Yes, I actually saw insider trading happen. Because I was interviewing someone at this conference, and he pulled out his phone, and he showed me a prediction market that had been placed on Manifold about whether \u201cThe New York Times\u201d would cover Manifold in an article in the year 2023. And as I was talking to him for this article, he was placing a large bet on yes on that market with his insider information, which is that a reporter from \u201cThe New York Times\u201d was, in fact, interviewing him for an article.</p><p><i>Casey Newton</i></p><p>And how does the platform view that? Is it just sort of, well, all\u2019s fair in love and prediction markets?</p><p><i>Kevin Roose</i></p><p>So they actually think that insider information and insider trading is good. Because people with inside information have the best information, and they can bring it to a market. They have some sort of elaborate theoretical underpinning for not believing that insider trading actually should be illegal. Right now, all of this is play money, right? Because of our gambling laws in the US, there are a couple sort of small real-money prediction markets that are very limited, and it\u2019s not worth going into why. But most forms of real-money prediction markets are not legal in the US.</p><p><i>Casey Newton</i></p><p>Right. And at Manifold, they use something called mana as the virtual currency, which is also the same currency that you use to cast spells and Magic the Gathering and Diablo, so you\u2019re going to want to manage your resources wisely.</p><p><i>Kevin Roose</i></p><p>Exactly. So this is this play currency called mana that you can use on the platform. They have leaderboards for who\u2019s got the most mana. You can also convert it into charity donations. They are not allowed to pay out real money for people who are right on these gambles. And the people at this conference were upset about that. They think this should be legal. I have some concerns about that. I just don\u2019t know what it would look like for a society to be gambling on everything all the time. But they are of the mind that the benefits of legalizing this kind of prediction market would outweigh the costs.</p><h3>Skepticism of \u201cskin in the game\u201d</h3><p><i>Casey Newton</i></p><p>You know, I got to say, Kevin, I\u2019m of really mixed mind about this. Because on one hand, the idea of people, like, betting play money to guess what might happen seems totally innocuous. Have a good time. It seems like you had a great time at this conference, seemed like all the other people who were there did, too. But I start to hear things like, well, these folks think that insider trading should be legal, and I just start to think, keep them away from the real economy. And this whole idea that we make better decisions when we have skin in the game, I just think, has been really challenged over the past few years, right? Like, this was one of the big arguments for crypto. And crypto is the place where we used to hear all the time, you got to have skin in the game. I use \u2014 we were told for years, you can make a better social network if you have skin in the game. Right? You can develop a better relationship between musicians and fans if the fans have skin in the game. The whole idea of the Bored Ape Yacht Club was, give people skin in the game and they\u2019ll be able to make movies. And it all just kind of came to nothing. And one of the reasons was that when you give people skin in the game and everything just has this, like, gross economic incentive tied to it, it just changes behavior. And people start, kind of, behaving in antisocial ways. So what do you think about the value of people having skin in the game? And is it possible that they\u2019re overstating the benefits here?</p><h3>Prediction markets in the New York Times?</h3><p><i>Kevin Roose</i></p><p>One application of this that I actually think is kind of interesting would be, in our industry, in media \u2014 I had a conversation with the guy who runs Astral Codex Ten, and one thing that he was saying is like, if \u201cThe New York Times\u201d put little prediction-market things at the bottom of articles, for example, that might give readers a better sense of what the probabilities behind the news events that they\u2019re reading about are. So you could have an article about who will be the next speaker of the House, and then at the bottom of the article, you could have a little widget that sort of gave you the prediction market for someone specific or sort of an indicator of where the betting odds were on various people. And that might actually help you come to a better conclusion than just reading the article alone. Do you think that makes any sense?</p><p><i>Casey Newton</i></p><p>Yeah, I think you subscribe to \u201cThe New York Times,\u201d and you\u2019re given a certain amount of New York toobles, and then you sort of bet your toobles on who will be the next House speaker and \u2014 I mean, what that makes me think of is the way that polls would be gamed on Twitter in the heyday, right? People would say, like, hey, do you think this thing is going to happen? And then, it would get gamed as the most zealous partisans would stuff the ballot box until the poll was over. And I wonder what mechanisms might be put in place to prevent something like that from happening here.</p><p>But on balance, I\u2019m persuaded that this is an interesting technology. And one thing that I have just observed in moving through Silicon Valley is that you do just constantly meet people who are into prediction markets. You know, it\u2019s like, along with poker, these are the two preferred forms of gambling and, increasingly, ways of socializing here in our strange little corner.</p><h3>Calling pundits to account</h3><p><i>Kevin Roose</i></p><p>Totally. I mean, the first place I saw this take off was among AI researchers, who love to bet on, for example, what year we will get AGI or, like, when the first AI-generated screenplay will win an Oscar and things like that. And so they really are sort of running prediction models in their heads at all times. There\u2019s this sort of cohort of people who are very into what they call Bayesian analysis or, like, attaching probabilities to things and living their lives that way. Do I think that is the way most people live their lives? Absolutely not. But it is sort of an interesting idea. And as someone who makes predictions sometimes as part of my job, it\u2019s interesting to contemplate a world in which your position as a pundit or a columnist or a newsletter writer would be quantifiable in some way. Like, readers of \u201cPlatformer\u201d could go in and say, OK, Casey\u2019s predictions were 75 percent right last year, so I\u2019m going to trust him more. But if his predictions fall to only 50 percent right next year, maybe I\u2019ll cancel my subscription.</p><p><i>Casey Newton</i></p><p>And, like, by the way, how amazing would it be to have the pundit score that sort of said this person predicted these 50 concrete things in the past year and 12 of them happened? That feels like \u2014 that feels like the sort of information that the right person would sue to get taken off of Google.</p>", "user": {"username": "akrolsmir"}}, {"_id": "9uXe6KBoNtsjQuEkt", "title": "Crafting Our Mission Statement: Weighted Factor Models, Shallow Research, and Lessons Learned for Clarity and Impact", "postedAt": "2023-10-13T16:43:50.574Z", "htmlBody": "<h1>TL;DR</h1><p>Thank you to everyone who has connected with us, and provided us with feedback/suggestions since&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/cCYtMvAaJETLmJT7W/p/aNKBwj6esW7RdvnwJ\"><u>our last post</u></a>.

In Chapter 5, the handbook introduces the Swiss Army knife of decision-making, called multi-factor decision-making:</p><blockquote><p>It involves combining multiple factors or variables into a single conclusion. Unlike the Swiss Army knife, this tool only gets stronger as you acquire other tools, as its combining process can get more informed and sophisticated.</p></blockquote><p>In particular, it delves into the pros and cons of multi-factor decision-making using spreadsheets, or weighted factor models (WFM).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Having been a spreadsheet enthusiast even before reading the handbook, I\u2019ve tinkered with and built sheets for everything from work tasks (like analyzing advertising campaigns, or tracking down conversions issues with marketing partners) to personal life things (like tracking my kids\u2019 goals progress to reward them, or finding out which are the best Pok\u00e9mon to invest stardust into in Pok\u00e9mon Go).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks to the handbook, the weighted factor model is now one of my go-to tools, and this methodology was applied to refine, converge, and ultimately select our mission statement.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h1>Ten Steps Process</h1><p>The handbook referenced this post (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/q7s8v7LjAdcYXAyAs/using-a-spreadsheet-to-make-good-decisions-five-examples#Who_should_we_hire__\"><u>Using a Spreadsheet to Make Good Decisions: Five Examples</u></a>), which has examples of how to apply the ten steps in different scenarios.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In short, here is the ten step process and how we applied it:</p><ol><li>Come up with a well-defined goal.<ul><li>To write a clear and impactful mission statement</li></ul></li><li>Brainstorm many plausible solutions to achieve that goal.<ul><li>Wrote many different mission statements</li></ul></li><li>Create criteria through which you will evaluate those solutions.<ul><li>See the full list of criteria we came up with below</li></ul></li><li>Create custom weights for the criteria.<ul><li>See image below for weights we used</li></ul></li><li>Quickly use intuition to prioritize the solutions on the criteria so far (e.g., high, medium, and low)<ul><li>The intuition ranking in our case, is how each co-founder \u201clikes\u201d each mission statement</li></ul></li><li>Come up with research questions that would help you determine how well each solution fits the criteria<ul><li>Step 6 and 7 aren\u2019t really applicable in terms of additional research questions i don\u2019t think</li><li>See image below for the scores where we nitpicked each mission statement based on different criteria</li></ul></li><li>Use the research questions to do shallow research into the top ideas (you can review more ideas depending on how long the research takes per idea, how important the decision is, and/or how confident you are in your intuitions)</li><li>Use research to re-rate and re-rank the solutions</li><li>Pick the top ideas worth testing and do deeper research or MVP testing, as is applicable<ul><li>We took the highly scored missions statements and continued to iterate on them</li></ul></li><li>Repeat steps 8 and 9 until sufficiently confident in a decision.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Our Criteria</h1><p>Shallow research we did to come up with the criteria to rank each mission statement:</p><ol><li><strong>Start with Why &amp; Purpose</strong>: Understand and articulate why the organization exists, its purpose, cause, or belief.

We wanted to ensure that the \"Why\" is at the heart of it because we think it is the foundation to inspire.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9uXe6KBoNtsjQuEkt/e3pkovhw8qnmayniztx2\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Brief word about the weighting</h2><p>One of the reasons why I love the WFM is that it is very flexible.

Reading&nbsp;<a href=\"https://simonsinek.com/books/start-with-why/\"><u>\"Start with Why\" by Simon Sinek</u></a> years ago made a profound impact on me, and I have benefited from many of the principles taught in that book in my business career.</p><p>The power of a mission statement is in its ability to inspire, guide, and unify an organization while also resonating with its broader audience. It's the foundation upon which organization stories are built and legacies are created.</p><p>Thus, we used a simplified formula for a mission statement based on the \"Start With Why\" book:</p><blockquote><p>[WHY you exist] + [HOW you achieve your Why] + [WHAT you do]</p></blockquote><p>or</p><blockquote><p>To [YOUR WHY] by [YOUR HOW], we [YOUR WHAT]</p></blockquote><p><br>Using this formula, here's an example of the top choice that surfaced from our mission statement WFM:</p><blockquote><p>StakeOut.AI fights to safeguard humanity from AI-driven disempowerment (WHY). We use evidence-based outreach to inform people of the threats that advanced AI poses to their economic livelihoods and personal safety (HOW). Our mission is to create a united front for humanity, driving national and international coordination on robust solutions to AI-driven disempowerment (WHAT).</p></blockquote><h1><br><br>Our Invitation</h1><h2>I can send you our template to save you time</h2><p>If you want to start using WFM and don\u2019t want to spend the time to configure it, feel free to comment, message me on this forum or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/harryluk/\"><u>LinkedIn</u></a>.

That space is huge and it includes absolutely awful things, and mixed-bag things, and maybe some things that almost everyone would agree are really wonderful, or at least an improvement on the way that things work today. But that raises all kinds of tricky questions.</p><p>Now, that\u2019s obviously a thought experiment that\u2019s removed from the real world. Here, things are messier. But my concern is that if we don\u2019t approach the evolution of collective decision making and government in a deliberate way, we may end up inadvertently backing ourselves into a corner, where we have ended up on some slippery slope \u2014 and all of a sudden we have, let\u2019s say, autocracies on the global stage are strengthened relative to democracies.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Yeah, I guess it\u2019s very natural to worry that countries that are already autocratic would use these tools to engage in a level of monitoring of individuals that currently would be impractical. You could just constantly be checking all of the messages that people are sending and receiving, or using the fact that we have microphones in almost every room to have these automated systems detecting whether people are doing anything that is contrary to the wishes of the government. And that could just create a much greater degree of lock-in even than there is now.</p><p>Are you also worried about these kinds of technologies being abused in countries like the United States or the UK in the medium term?</p><p><strong>Tantum Collins:</strong> I\u2019m certainly not worried in the medium term about existing democracies like, let\u2019s say, the US and the UK, becoming something that we would describe as autocratic. Perhaps another way of reframing it would be: I worry that we\u2019ve already left opportunities on the table, and that the number of opportunities we will end up leaving on the table could grow. Both to make government more effective in a sort of ideology-agnostic sense \u2014 doing things on time and in ways that are affordable and so on \u2014 and secondly, missing opportunities to make these institutions more democratic, say, to bind them to reflective popular will.</p><p>And we can look at even contemporary democracies: the bitrate of preference communication has remained more or less the same for a long time, while government capacity has expanded significantly. In that sense, we\u2019ve sort of already lost some level of democratic oversight. And this is something that, no, I\u2019m not worried about these countries becoming the PRC \u2014 but I do think that there\u2019s lots of stuff that we could do to improve the degree to which we instantiate the principles of democracy.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>What do people in government make of AI x-risk concerns?</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Tantum Collins:</strong> Government is always very big and distributed, so I wouldn\u2019t say this is an authoritative recounting, but I\u2019m happy to give my take from the sliver of things that I\u2019ve seen. Obviously the institution I\u2019m most familiar with is the US government. I think that to some extent this can generalise, especially for other closely allied governments \u2014 so let\u2019s say Five Eyes and G7 and so on.</p><p>It is certainly the case that the amount of attention dedicated towards AI in government has increased significantly over the past couple of years. And that includes the amount of attention even just proportionately: that there has been an increase in the consideration given to risks. That includes things that people would categorise as x-risk, as well as all kinds of regular, active, ongoing harms: algorithmic discrimination, interpretability issues and so on. So all of this is getting more attention.</p><p>I think in particular, some of the things that people who are worried about x-risk tend to focus on actually fit into preexisting national security priorities pretty well. So for instance, if we think about cyber-related x-risk having to do with AI or AI-related biorisk: these are categories of harms that, although previously not mainly through lens of AI-related stuff, there are plenty of institutions and people in the US government and in other governments that have been worried about those types of risks for a long time. And I think it\u2019s safe to say that almost everyone, for almost all of these, in almost all these domains, AI risk is now top of mind.</p><p>That doesn\u2019t mean that if you go into the White House, you will see people doing <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/potential-risks-advanced-ai/\">Open Phil-style very rigorous rankings</a> based on importance and neglectedness and tractability and so on. And it doesn\u2019t mean that the people whose work ends up reducing these risks would even articulate it in the way that someone in, let\u2019s say, the EA community would. But I do think that increasingly a lot of this work in government sort of dovetails with those priorities, if that makes sense.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Yeah, that does make sense. I think it\u2019s also quite sensible that this is maybe the extinction risk or the catastrophic risk that governments are turning their attention to first, because it seems like the potential misuse of large language models or other AI models to help with bioterrorism or development of bioweapons or to engage in cyberattacks seems like something that could be serious in the next few years. I guess we don\u2019t know how serious it will be; we don\u2019t know how many people will actually try it, but it does seem like an imminent threat. And so people should be thinking about what we can do now.</p><p><strong>Tantum Collins:</strong> Yeah, exactly. So I\u2019m happy to say that there are absolutely smart, capable people working in government who are worried about those things. If that helps you and the listeners sleep easily at night.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Misconceptions about AI in China</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Tantum Collins:</strong> I think that a lot of news coverage of China tends to fluctuate between extremes. And this is true in AI as well as more broadly, where there will be a hype cycle that is, \u201cThe rise of China is inevitable,\u201d and then there will be a hype cycle that says, \u201cA centralised system was never going to work. Why did we ever take this threat seriously?\u201d And of course, almost always the reality is somewhere in the middle.</p><p>I think that when China began making investments in AI, in particular with the 2017 release of this <a href=\"https://digichina.stanford.edu/work/full-translation-chinas-new-generation-artificial-intelligence-development-plan-2017/\">report</a> from the State Council that was AI focused, I think that that, for a lot of people, was the first time that they began paying attention to what might China-related AI things look like. And in some critical ways, China is, of course, different than the US and other Western countries. I think that initially there was a moment of not fully appreciating how different the research culture, and in particular the relationship between companies and the government, is in China, relative to Western countries.</p><p>But now I worry that things have gone too far, and that people have these caricatured versions in their mind of what things look like in China. There are many of these, but to list a few, there is a meme that I think is inaccurate and unhelpful: that China can copy but not innovate. And obviously, historically, China has been responsible for a huge amount of scientific innovation. And also recently, again, the number of papers coming out of China on AI has increased significantly, it\u2019s more than any other country. I mean, there are loads of examples of very impressive, innovative scientific achievements coming out of China.</p><p>In particular, to cite Jeff again, he has written an <a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09692290.2023.2173633\">interesting paper</a> that describes the difference between innovation and diffusion of technologies in terms of the effect it has on national power. And so there are some countries that historically played a big role in <a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-journal-of-international-security/article/engines-of-power-electricity-ai-and-generalpurpose-military-transformations/7999C41177B0C2A7084BD3C1EAC0E219\">early industrial technology</a>, but didn\u2019t manage to diffuse it across the country effectively enough to, for instance, make the most of it from a military perspective or economic growth. And there are others that did the inverse. So in the 1800s, there was a lot of commentary that the US was terrible at creating things, but was pretty good at copying and diffusing.</p><p>Jeff has a take \u2014 he has some interesting ways of measuring this \u2014 that today China is actually, in a proportional sense, better at innovation and worse at diffusion. And that one big strength that the United States has from a competitive angle is that it\u2019s actually much better at diffusion. I think that will strike a lot of people as being the inverse of what they think, based on having read some stories about high speed rail and solar cell production and so on. They have this meme of China can copy these things and suffuse it across the country and reduce the cost of production, but it isn\u2019t able to create things.</p><p>I think that\u2019s an area where I can see where that stereotype came from, based on the specific economic investments that China made in the 1990s and 2000s, but I think it is inaccurate \u2014 and people risk misunderstanding how things look if they buy into that.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>The most promising regulatory approaches</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Tantum Collins:</strong> I think there are a few like level-zero, foundational things that make sense to do. One is, at the moment, especially in the West, there are major disconnects between just the way that people in government use language and think about things relative to the way that people in the tech world do. So one important step zero is just increasing communication between labs and governments, and I think recently there\u2019s been a lot of positive movement in that direction.</p><p>A second and related thing, and this somewhat ties back to these democratisation questions, is that even under the most competent technocracy, I would be worried about a process that doesn\u2019t involve a significant amount of public consultation, given how general purpose these systems are, and how pervasive the effects that they could have on our lives will be. And so I think that government has a lot of work to do \u2014 both in terms of reaching out to and engaging the AI community, and also in terms of engaging the general public.</p><p>There\u2019s been a lot of cool work in this direction recently. I\u2019d highlight what <a href=\"https://cip.org/\">The Collective Intelligence Project</a> has undertaken. They\u2019ve led a series of what they call \u201c<a href=\"https://cip.org/alignmentassemblies\">alignment assemblies</a>\u201c: essentially exercises designed to engage large, ideally representative subsets of the population with questions about what kinds of AI things worry you the most.</p><p>Also, recently from labs there\u2019s been some interest in this stuff. OpenAI has this <a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/democratic-inputs-to-ai\">democratic input for AI grant</a> that people have just applied for. And then also there are several labs that are working on projects in the vein of, in particular, LLMs: how can we use these to facilitate larger-scale deliberative processes than before? And <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.15006\">one of the projects</a> I worked on when I was at DeepMind \u2014 and I\u2019m actually still collaborating with some of my former colleagues at DeepMind on \u2014 is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.11932\">something in this direction</a>.</p><p>So that would be some sort of very basic, before even landing on a policy stuff, that I think is important. Beyond that, I think that there are some areas that are relatively uncontroversially good. So to the extent that we think that AI will, at some level, be a public good, and that private market incentives will not sufficiently incentivise the kind of safety and ethics research that we want to happen, I think that allocating some public funding for that stuff is a good idea. And that\u2019s the full gamut of x-risk alignment things \u2014 like more present-day prosaic ethics impact considerations, interpretability research: the full list.</p><p>And a final thing that I think is as close to a no-brainer as you can get is that clearly some kind of clearer benchmarking and standards regime is important \u2014 because right now it\u2019s sort of the Wild West, and these things are just out there. And not only is it difficult to measure what these things can and cannot do, but there is almost nothing in the way of widely known trusted intermediary certifications that a nonexpert user can engage with to get a feel for how and when they should use a given system.</p><p>So there are a whole bunch of different proposals \u2014 some involve the government itself setting up regulatory standards; some involve some kind of third-party verification \u2014 but having <i>something</i>. And that could be <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/model-cards\">model cards</a>, it could be the equivalent of nutritional labels. It\u2019s kind of a whole range of options there. But at the moment I think a lot of people are sort of flying blind.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Who's ultimately responsible for the consequences of AI?</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> It\u2019s very unclear to me how responsibility for the consequences of AI is split across various different parts of the US government. It feels a bit like there\u2019s no identifiable actor who really has to think about this holistically. Is that right?</p><p><strong>Tantum Collins:</strong> Yes, this is true. And in part this gets back to this issue of AI is, A, new; B, so general that it challenges the taxonomy of government stuff; and C, something that government has not until recently engaged with meaningfully in its current form. So various government research projects throughout time have used some kind of AI, but government was not really in any meaningful way driving the past decade of machine learning progress. And all of this means that there are a tonne of open questions about how government thinks about AI-related responsibilities and where those sit.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Who are the different players though, who at least are responsible for some aspect of this?</p><p><strong>Tantum Collins:</strong> So within the White House, the sort of main groups would be the Office of Science and Technology Policy, where I worked before. That, within it, has a number of different teams, several of which are quite interested in AI. There is one small group that is explicitly dedicated to AI; there is a national security team, that was where I sat, that handles a lot of AI-related things; and then there is the science and society team, that was the team that produced the Blueprint for an AI Bill of Rights. Each of these groups work together quite a fair bit, and each one has a slightly different outlook and set of priorities related to AI.</p><p>Then you have the National Security Council, which has a tech team within it that also handles a fair amount of AI stuff. At the highest level, OSTP historically has been a bit more long-run conceptual research-y, putting together big plans for what the government\u2019s position should be on approach to funding cures for a given disease, let\u2019s say. And the NSC has traditionally been a bit more close to the decision making of senior leaders. And that has the benefit of, in some immediate sense, being higher impact, but also being more reactive and less long-run thinking wise. Again, these are huge generalisations, but those are sort of two of the groups within the White House that are especially concerned about AI.</p><p>These days, of course, because AI is on everyone\u2019s mind, every single imaginable bit of the government has released some statement that references AI. But in terms of the groups that have large responsibility for it, then of course there is the whole world of departments and agencies, all of which have different AI-related equities.</p><p>So there\u2019s NIST, which does regulatory stuff. There\u2019s the National Science Foundation, which of course funds a fair amount of AI-related research. There\u2019s the Department of Energy, which runs the national labs. And the name is slightly misleading because they don\u2019t just do energy stuff.</p><p>The Department of Energy is actually this incredibly powerful and really, really big organisation. [Before I came into government] I thought they do wind farms and things. But it turns out that, because they\u2019re in charge of a lot of nuclear development and security, they actually, especially in the national security space, have quite a lot of authority and a very large budget.</p><p>Of course, in addition to all the stuff in the executive, then there\u2019s Congress \u2014 which has at various times thrown various AI-related provisions into these absolutely massive bills. So far, I believe both the House and the Senate have AI-focused committees or groups of some kind. I\u2019m not super clear on what they\u2019re doing, but obviously there is also the potential for AI-related legislation.</p><p>Anyway, the list goes on, as you can imagine. Obviously the Department of Defense and the intelligence community also do various AI-related projects. But yeah, at the moment there isn\u2019t a clear coordinating entity. There have been a number of proposals. One that\u2019s been in the news is <a href=\"https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-openai-ceo-sam-altman-testifies-before-senate-judiciary-committee\">Sam Altman suggested</a> during his testimony that there should be a new agency created to focus specifically on AI. I think it remains to be determined whether that happens and what that looks like.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>How technical experts could communicate better with policymakers</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Tantum Collins:</strong> This is a great question. It\u2019s actually one area that I think LLMs could be very valuable, to go back to this parallel between translation across actual languages and translation across academic or professional vernaculars. I think that we could save a lot of time by fine-tuning systems to do better mappings of \u201cexplain this technical AI concept to someone who\u2026 is a trained lawyer.\u201d And often then you can actually find that there are sort of these weird overlaps. Not necessarily full isomorphisms, but a lot of the conceptual tooling that people have in really different domains accomplishes similar things, and can be repurposed to explain something in an area that they\u2019re not too familiar with. So this is an area where I think that there is a lot of cool AI-driven work that can be done.</p><p>In terms of practical advice to people trying to explain things, this is tricky, because there are many ways in which you want to frame things differently. I\u2019m trying to think of a set of principles that capture these, because a lot of it is just very specific word choice.</p><p>Maybe a few off the top of my head would be: One, just read political news and read some policy documents to get a feel for how things are typically described, and that should be a decent start. Two, I think in general, in policy space, you obviously want to reduce the use of technical language, but even sort of philosophical-type abstraction that can be helpful in a lot of other domains. And so the more that things can be grounded in concrete concepts and also incentives that will be familiar to people. In the policy space, a lot of that has to do with thinking about what the domestic and foreign policy considerations are that are relevant to this.</p><p>I mean, obviously it depends on the group \u2014 like, is it a group of senators or people at OSTP or something \u2014 but broadly speaking, if you read global news, you\u2019ll get a sense of what people care about. A lot of people are really worried about competition with China, for better or worse. So to ground this, one example here would be: to the extent that the framing of China competition is inevitable, one can harness that to make the case that, for instance, leading in AI safety is an area that could be excellent for the scientific prestige of a country, right? And it could improve the brand of a place where things are done safely and reliably, and where you can trust services and so on. You can take something that otherwise a policymaker might dismiss as heavy techno-utopianism, and if you are willing to cheapen yourself a little bit in terms of how to sell it, you can get more attention.</p><p>Obviously this is a sliding scale, and you don\u2019t want to take it too far. But I think a lot can be accomplished by thinking about what the local political incentives are that people have.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Tension between those focused on x-risk and those focused on AI ethics</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Tantum Collins:</strong> I have a few low-confidence thoughts. One is that there are some areas where there is, I think, the perception of some finite resource \u2014 and maybe that\u2019s money or maybe it\u2019s attention. And I think there is an understandable concern on the AI ethics side that there is sometimes a totalising quality to the way that some people worry about existential risks. At its best, I think that x-risk concern is expressed in ways that are appropriately caveated and so on, and at its worst it can imply that nothing else matters because of running some set of hypothetical numbers. Personally, I\u2019m a bit of a pluralist, and so I don\u2019t think that everything comes down to utils. I think that the outlook of, \u201cIf you reduce existential risk by X percent then this so dwarfs every other concern\u201d is something that I can see why that rubs people the wrong way.</p><p>A second thing that I think sometimes brings some of these views or these communities into conflict is the idea that there are some types of behaviour \u2014 whether that\u2019s from labs or proposed policies \u2014 that could help. I\u2019m in particular thinking of things that would have some security benefits that people who are concerned about x-risk value very highly, but that might come at the cost of other things that we value in a pluralistic society \u2014 for instance, openness and competition.</p><p>A lot of the policies that we haven\u2019t talked about yet \u2014 because so far we\u2019ve been focusing on no-brainer, almost everyone should get behind these \u2014 there are a lot of very tricky ones that you can see a case for and you can see a case against, and often they pit these values against one another. If you\u2019re really, really, really worried about existential risk, then it\u2019s better to have fewer entities that are coordinating stuff, and to have those be fairly consolidated and to work very closely with the government.</p><p>If you don\u2019t take existential risk that seriously \u2014 and if instead, you are comparatively more worried about having a flourishing and open scientific ecosystem, making sure that small players can have access to cutting-edge models and capabilities and so on; and a lot of these things historically have correlated with the health of open and distributed societies \u2014 then those policies look really different.</p><p>I think that the question of how we grapple with these competing interests is a really difficult one. And I worry that, at its worst, the x-rist community \u2014 which broadly, I should say, I think does lots of excellent work, and has put its finger on very real concerns \u2014 but at its worst, there can be this sort of totalising attitude that maybe refuses to grapple with a different set of frameworks for assessing these issues. And I think that\u2019s sometimes exacerbated by the fact that it is on average not a super-representative community, geographically or ethnically and what have you. I think that means that it\u2019s easy to be blind to some of the things that other people, for good reason, are worried about.</p><p>That would be my very high-level framing of it. But the bottom line is that I very much agree with your sentiment that most of the conflict between these groups is counterproductive. And if we\u2019re talking about the difference between pie splitting and pie expansion, there\u2019s a huge amount of pie expansion and a whole bunch of policies that should be in the collective interest. And especially since I think the listenership here is probably a little bit more EA-skewed, I\u2019d very much encourage people to engage with \u2014 this sounds so trite \u2014 but really to listen to some of the claims from the non-x-risk AI ethics community, because there is a lot of very valuable stuff there, and it\u2019s just a different perspective on some of these issues.</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "80000_Hours"}}, {"_id": "i7uBjkgMndammmQ5o", "title": "Should we push for a rapid malaria vaccine rollout?", "postedAt": "2023-10-13T14:56:10.228Z", "htmlBody": "<p>There has been some buzz recently about the new malaria vaccine.

In contrast, vaccination for say COVID in the developed world (Town B) ended the emergency and restored normality thus saving a large percent of the deaths that might have occurred.

This post considers the implications of contractualism for cause prioritization.&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Executive Summary</strong></h1><ul><li>Contractualism says that morality is about what we can justify to those affected by our actions. It explains why we care about morality by way of our interest in justifying ourselves to reasonable others. Insofar as we care about the relevant kind of justification, we should be able to feel the pull of contractualism. And insofar as contractualism captures moral judgments that consequentialist moral theories don't, we may be inclined to give some credence to the view.&nbsp;</li><li>Contractualism says: When your actions could benefit both an individual and a group, don't compare the individual's claim to aid to the <i>group's</i>&nbsp;claim to aid, which assumes that you can aggregate claims across individuals. Instead, compare an individual's claim to aid to the claim of every other relevant individual in the situation by pairwise comparison. If one individual's claim to aid is a lot stronger than any other's, then you should help them. (That being said, contractualism is also compatible with saying: When the group is large enough and each group member\u2019s claim is nearly as strong as the individual\u2019s, you should help the group.)&nbsp;Contractualism, therefore, offers an alternative way of thinking about what it means to help others as much as possible with the resources available.</li><li>Accordingly, contractualism recommends a different approach to cost-effectiveness analysis than the one that\u2019s dominant in EA. The standard EA view is that we should maximize expected value. The contractualist view is that insofar as we should maximize, we should be maximizing something like \u201cthe relevant strength-weighted moral claims that are addressed per dollar spent,\u201d where the strength of an individual\u2019s claim is largely determined by the gain in expected value for that individual if the act is performed.</li><li>So, it may be true that some x-risk-oriented interventions can help us all avoid a premature death due to a global catastrophe; maybe they can help ensure that many future people come into existence. But how strong is any individual's claim to your help to avoid an x-risk or to come into existence? Even if future people matter as much as present people (i.e., even if we assume that totalism is true), the answer is: Not strong at all, as you should discount it by the expected size of the benefit <i>and you don\u2019t aggregate benefits across persons</i>. Since any given future person only has an infinitesimally small chance of coming into existence, they have an infinitesimally weak claim to aid. By contrast, you can help the world's poorest people a lot and with high confidence. So, given contractualism, the claims of the world's poorest people win.</li><li>Contractualism probably won't justify prioritizing all the things that EAs do related to global poverty. Essentially, it looks like it most clearly supports GiveWell-Top-Charity-like interventions\u2014e.g., the kind of work that the Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) does\u2014because of the high probability of significant impact.</li></ul><h1><strong>1. Introduction</strong></h1><p>What, if anything, could justify shifting resources away from the Against Malaria Foundation (AMF) and toward existential risk mitigation efforts (x-risk)?</p><p>One way to feel the force of this question is to imagine having to justify such a shift <i>to a desperately poor person</i>\u2014someone who may well die, or whose child may well die, because of your decision to allocate resources elsewhere. What, if anything, could you say to such a person?</p><p>There might be an adequate answer. Even if so, it would be surprising if it were easy to make the case to someone in such dire circumstances. And insofar as you feel pressure to be able to give a satisfying case to such a person, you should feel the pull of <i>contractualism</i>\u2014a moral theory that\u2019s become increasingly popular over the last 40 years. The central contractualist thesis (at least as T. M. Scanlon&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674004238\">1998</a>) understands it, which is the version of the position on which we\u2019ll focus here) is that moral wrongness is a matter of <i>unjustifiability to others</i>&nbsp;(and moral rightness a matter of justifiability to others). This theory promises to explain why morality is motivating: we care about morality because we care about being able to justify ourselves to others.</p><p>The purpose of this post is to consider the question of cause prioritization from the perspective of a non-consequentialist moral theory. We argue that contractualism generally looks more favorably upon interventions targeting very poor presently-existing individuals over interventions directed at protecting future people <i>even when the expected value </i>(EV) <i>of the other interventions would be higher</i>. Finally, we briefly consider the kinds of interventions that, you might think, would be especially important given contractualism: namely, interventions aimed at <i>redressing injustices </i>and those aimed at responding to claims grounded in <i>special relations</i>&nbsp;between beneficiaries and the benefactor. In those cases, we argue that contractualism does <i>not </i>require prioritizing injustices or those to whom we stand in special relations over the needs of badly-off distant strangers.</p><p>To be clear: this document is <i>not</i> a detailed vindication of any particular class of philanthropic interventions. For example, although we think that contractualism supports a sunnier view of helping the global poor than funding x-risk projects, contractualism does not, for all our argument implies, entail that many EA-funded global poverty interventions are morally preferable to all other options (some of which are probably high-risk, high-reward longshots). In addition, contractualism doesn\u2019t vindicate (say) global-poor\u2013targeting interventions <i>on the same grounds</i>&nbsp;that many other theories would.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5zel370ijcs\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5zel370ijcs\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;For example, while some would favor antimalarial bednet distribution because of the number of DALYs that such an intervention averts, if contractualism favors antimalarial bednet distribution, then this is for very different reasons (as will become clearer in the next couple of sections). Still, we might have thought that contractualism couldn't provide any guidance at all when it comes to cause prioritization. If the arguments of this post are correct, that isn't true.</p><h1><strong>2. Contractualism</strong></h1><p>The canonical statement of contemporary contractualism is Thomas Scanlon\u2019s <i>What We Owe to Each Other</i>&nbsp;(1998).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7v03h2urgx\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7v03h2urgx\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;We\u2019ll mostly (though, as will emerge, not entirely) treat Scanlon\u2019s version of contractualism as representative of the view\u2014or, at any rate, the aspects of the view relevant to our discussion.</p><p>Scanlon\u2019s view has been the subject of an enormous amount of discussion<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefix0e6alp35a\"><sup><a href=\"#fnix0e6alp35a\">[3]</a></sup></span>; philosophers disagree about how best to interpret it as well as about its implications for practical ethics. However, it\u2019s safe to say that the heart of Scanlon\u2019s view is the following thesis:</p><ul><li><strong>(C1) </strong>An act is wrong if and only if, and because, it is unjustifiable to others.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkhdoh3fu3hj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkhdoh3fu3hj\">[4]</a></sup></span></li></ul><p>Many moral theorists would agree that (as (C1) implies) the wrong acts are precisely those that are unjustifiable to others. But (C1) says that when an act is wrong, it's wrong <i>because</i>&nbsp;it's unjustifiable to others. (C1) is therefore incompatible with the (more commonplace) claim that when an act is wrong, it\u2019s also unjustifiable to others as a consequence of whatever wrong-making property it has.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref34laz9g8i95\"><sup><a href=\"#fn34laz9g8i95\">[5]</a></sup></span></p><p>Utilitarians, for instance, can accept that the wrong acts are precisely those that are unjustifiable to others, but they'll say that wrong acts are wrong not <i>because</i>&nbsp;they are unjustifiable to others but because they fail to maximize expected value (EV). And there is nothing special about utilitarianism in this respect. Virtually all non-contractualist moral theorists will hold that wrongness is grounded not in unjustifiability to others but in some other property, which might itself also ground unjustifiability to others. Hence (C1)\u2019s distinctiveness.</p><p>What makes an act unjustifiable to others? Scanlon formulates his answer to this question in a few ways, but here\u2019s a simple formulation for present purposes:</p><ul><li><strong>(C2) </strong>An act is unjustifiable to others (under the circumstances) if and only if, and because, any principle that would permit its performance (under the circumstances) could be reasonably rejected by someone other than the agent.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7veilgvlpt\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7veilgvlpt\">[6]</a></sup></span></li></ul><p>We\u2019ll clarify the post-\u201cbecause\u201d clause of (C2) below. But first, note that as (C1) and (C2) suggest, Scanlon holds that <i>wrongness</i>&nbsp;(of your act), <i>unjustifiability</i>&nbsp;(of your act) <i>to others</i>, and <i>reasonable rejectability</i>&nbsp;(of any principle that would permit your act) are a package deal: they\u2019re all present in a given situation or all absent from it. Scanlon takes the co-presence of these properties to be a source of contractualism\u2019s attractiveness, for their co-presence allows contractualism to vindicate the importance of morality and the possibility of moral motivation. Scanlon regularly repeats that we have powerful reasons to want to stand in relations of justifiability to others, or in what he calls relations of \u201cmutual recognition.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsswxo8dgry\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsswxo8dgry\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;If morally right conduct is the conduct that allows us to stand in such relations with others, then morality turns out to be important and our ability to be moved by moral considerations turns out to be unmysterious.</p><p>Let\u2019s clarify the post-\u201cbecause\u201d clause of (C2) with one of Scanlon\u2019s examples:</p><blockquote><p><i><strong>Transmitter Room</strong></i><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;The World Cup final is currently being played. Jones, a technician in the room containing the equipment that is causing the game\u2019s worldwide television broadcast, has inadvertently come into contact with some exposed wires that are causing him very painful electric shocks. He is unable to extricate himself from his situation, but you can help him by turning off the machine with the exposed wires. Unfortunately, if you do this, then the World Cup broadcast will be shut down, and it won\u2019t be able to be restarted for 10 minutes.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref75dayn19ldg\"><sup><a href=\"#fn75dayn19ldg\">[8]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>All contractualists of whom we\u2019re aware (and many other non-consequentialists) share Scanlon\u2019s view that you ought to help Jones, even though doing so would (we can assume<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvm5c35lkvig\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvm5c35lkvig\">[9]</a></sup></span>) yield a much worse state of affairs overall&nbsp;than allowing him to continue being shocked. Suppose this is correct. How does the contractualist secure this verdict?</p><p>The contractualist first imagines some <i>principles</i>&nbsp;that could be thought to bear on the present situation. Consider four examples:</p><ul><li><strong>(P1) </strong>Do whatever would make things go best.</li><li><strong>(P2) </strong>Do whatever would help the most people.</li><li><strong>(P3) </strong>Prevent people from suffering serious harms unless doing so would result in misfortunes to others.</li><li><strong>(P4) </strong>Prevent serious harms to some even if in doing so you would expose many others to minor inconveniences.</li></ul><p>The contractualist now asks whether someone other than you could <i>reasonably reject</i>&nbsp;any of these principles. Scanlon discusses at great length what it takes to be able reasonably to reject a principle, with two constraints on reasonable rejection being especially important here. First, you can reasonably reject a principle only for what Scanlon calls \u201cpersonal reasons,\u201d i.e., reasons \u201ctied to the well-being, claims, or status of individuals in [some] particular situation\u201d (219). As Scanlon emphasizes, this requirement rules out various forms of interpersonal aggregation.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefm7bs9ffwt1\"><sup><a href=\"#fnm7bs9ffwt1\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;It isn\u2019t possible for, say, five people to \u201ccombine\u201d their personal reasons for objecting to a given principle into a stronger super-reason for objecting to this principle.</p><p>Second, and relatedly, whether you can reasonably reject a principle is determined by (among other things) the sizes of the burdens that would befall different parties as a result of your acting on this principle vs. an alternative. In particular, A can\u2019t reasonably reject some principle, P, merely on the grounds that your acting on P would impose some burden on A: after all, it could work out that your acting on any principle <i>other</i>&nbsp;than P would impose much greater burdens on someone else. By contrast and all else equal,&nbsp;B <i>can</i>&nbsp;reasonably reject some principle, P*, on the grounds that your acting on P* would impose burdens on B far greater than those that would be imposed on anyone other than B by your acting on some alternative principle.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefuqmvbx9dngp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnuqmvbx9dngp\">[11]</a></sup></span></p><p>Now consider how the contractualist will assess (P1)\u2013(P4). On the one hand, your acting on (P4) would impose a burden on each of the millions of viewers, namely the inconvenience of missing out on 10 minutes of the World Cup. On the other hand, your acting on any of (P1)\u2013(P3) would impose on Jones a vastly greater burden, namely continued seriously painful electric shocks. It thus seems clear that Jones\u2019s personal reason for objecting to each of (P1)\u2013(P3) is far stronger than anyone\u2019s personal reason for objecting to (P4). More generally, each of the millions of viewers seems to be such that whatever personal reason she might have for objecting to a principle that would license your saving Jones is far less strong than Jones\u2019s personal reason for objecting to any principle that would license your not saving him. So, no viewer can reasonably reject (P4); nor, it seems, can anyone else. Furthermore, it seems that Jones <i>can</i>&nbsp;reasonably reject each of (P1)\u2013(P3) and, indeed, it seems that Jones can reasonably reject any relevantly similar principle. Given contractualism, then, saving Jones is the uniquely permissible act available to you.</p><p>We just explained what a contractualist would say about <i>Transmitter Room</i>&nbsp;in line with Scanlon\u2019s own presentation of his ideas. But in what follows, we put talk of \u201cprinciples\u201d and \u201creasonable rejection\u201d to the side. It will simplify matters, and do no damage to the relevant features of contractualism, to formulate our discussion primarily in terms of <i>claims to assistance</i>. For example, in <i>Transmitter Room</i>, each viewer, V, has (as we\u2019ll put it) a <i>claim</i>&nbsp;to your allowing the broadcast to continue in virtue of the burden that would befall V as a result of your saving Jones instead; Jones has a far stronger <i>claim</i>&nbsp;to your saving him in virtue of the far more serious burden that would (continue to) befall him as a result of your allowing the broadcast to continue instead; and, given contractualism, you should satisfy a strong claim to your assistance over any number of individually far&nbsp;weaker claims.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbdokgnwjjhq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbdokgnwjjhq\">[12]</a></sup></span></p><p>We\u2019ve said enough to turn to contractualism\u2019s implications for philanthropic interventions. Additional details about the theory, and about specific versions of it, will emerge along the way.</p><h1><strong>3. Welfare-Oriented Interventions</strong></h1><p>In <i>Transmitter Room</i>, it\u2019s natural to say that the (sizes of the) claims to assistance of the various parties are grounded in welfare considerations. This section considers some philanthropic interventions naturally characterized as welfare-oriented: interventions aimed at improving the welfare of the <i>present global poor</i> (hereafter, \u201cthe global poor\" and various <i>x-risk</i>&nbsp;interventions. What we said above about <i>Transmitter Room</i>&nbsp;will illuminate what the contractualist should say about these interventions.</p><h2><strong>3.1. Global-Poor\u2013Oriented and X-risk Interventions</strong></h2><p>Suppose you\u2019re in a position to do either but not both of these things:</p><ul><li>Make a substantial donation to some charity helping the global poor (by, say, funding the manufacture and distribution of a large number of anti-malarial bednets);</li></ul><p><i>or</i></p><ul><li>Make a substantial donation to some organization that will yield a tiny reduction of the probability of some extinction event (e.g., the destruction of humanity via a large asteroid\u2019s collision with the earth).</li></ul><p>We\u2019ll present a three-step argument&nbsp;that, given contractualism, if you ought to do anything, you ought&nbsp;to donate to the global poor vs. try to mitigate x-risk, other relevant things equal.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhw6wtpoe7j5\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhw6wtpoe7j5\">[13]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The central plank of our argument is that, given contractualism, several people have moral claims to your donating to the global poor that are much stronger than even the strongest moral claims had by any individual to your trying to mitigate x-risk. After that, we\u2019ll argue that our argument also supports the conclusion that, given contractualism, you ought to pursue interventions like AMF over suffering-risk-mitigating (s-risk-mitigating) interventions. We\u2019ll conclude that contractualism supports interventions like AMF over x-risk interventions quite generally.</p><h3><strong>Step 1</strong></h3><p>First, we argue that contractualism recommends preventing:</p><ul><li><i>small</i>&nbsp;numbers of <i>grave</i>&nbsp;harms that are certain to occur without your intervention and certain not to occur with your intervention</li></ul><p>over:</p><ul><li>even <i>far larger</i>&nbsp;numbers of <i>comparatively tiny</i>&nbsp;such harms.</li></ul><p>In defense of this step, let's return to <i>Transmitter Room</i>&nbsp;and note two things about the case.</p><p>First, <i>Transmitter Room</i>&nbsp;involves no <i>uncertainty</i>&nbsp;about what will happen following each of your available actions. If you turn off the power, then Jones will stop being shocked and the viewers will be deprived of 10 minutes of the game; if you don\u2019t, then Jones will continue to be shocked and the viewers won\u2019t be deprived of any of the game.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, <i>Transmitter Room</i>&nbsp;plausibly counts as a case in which, in preventing one person from suffering serious harm, you would <i>cause</i>&nbsp;several others to suffer comparatively tiny harms. It isn\u2019t a straightforward case of choosing whether to prevent one person from suffering a serious harm or to prevent many others from suffering comparatively tiny ones. But, if anything, it seems <i>harder</i>&nbsp;to justify your conduct to others when, in preventing one from suffering serious harm, you cause several others to suffer comparatively tiny harms than when you merely prevent serious harm from befalling one over preventing comparatively tiny harms from befalling many others.&nbsp;</p><p>So, if (as we argued in Section 1) contractualism yields the verdict that you ought to aid Jones in <i>Transmitter Room</i>, then, if anything, it more strongly supports the verdict that you ought to prevent small numbers of grave harms over even far larger numbers of comparatively tiny harms. This completes Step 1 of our argument.</p><p>One point before we proceed.<i>&nbsp;</i>Call a harm that is certain to occur <i>without</i>&nbsp;your intervention and certain not to occur <i>with</i>&nbsp;your intervention an \u201cotherwise certain harm.\u201d We don\u2019t assume that contractualism recommends preventing a serious otherwise certain harm over any number of <i>arbitrarily slightly</i>&nbsp;individually smaller otherwise certain harms. For example, a contractualist can hold that you ought to prevent 1 million people from undergoing electric shocks slightly less painful than the ones Jones is suffering rather than preventing just one person from suffering electric shocks just like the ones Jones is suffering. Our argument is compatible with such a \u201climited aggregationist\u201d form of contractualism (and with its denial).</p><p>Admittedly, some contractualists (and other non-consequentialists) reject all forms of aggregation, limited and unlimited. And, as indicated already, Scanlon himself insists that his theory is non-aggregationist, at least insofar as it forbids combining different individuals\u2019 claims into super-claims of groups. However, Scanlon also rather famously argues that, sometimes, contractualism implies that the numbers count. For example, consider a case where you can prevent one person from dying or two others from dying but cannot aid all three. Suppose each person has a claim to your assistance of equal strength. Scanlon argues that you ought to save the two, by arguing that if you were to \u201cjust save\u201d the one, or were to give the two groups equal chances to be saved, then the additional party on the side of the two would have a justified complaint against you, on the grounds that you would thereby act as though the case were a one-versus-one case,&nbsp;and so act in a way that is inappropriately responsive to his presence. The idea, then, is that contractualists ought to count numbers in at least some cases without aggregating interests or claims.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefc0620ar98q\"><sup><a href=\"#fnc0620ar98q\">[14]</a></sup></span></p><p>Suppose that this argument, or something relevantly like it, succeeds. Now consider the following case:</p><blockquote><p><i><strong>Death/Paraplegia</strong></i><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;You can prevent Nora from dying or <i>n</i> other people from getting permanent paraplegia, but you can't save everyone.</p></blockquote><p>We find it plausible that if Scanlon\u2019s argument for saving the greater number succeeds, then, for some&nbsp;<i>n</i>, you ought to save the <i>n</i>. Here\u2019s our thinking: First, imagine a version of <i>Death/Paraplegia</i>&nbsp;in which <i>n</i> = 1. In this case, you ought to save Nora outright. Now imagine a version in which <i>n</i> = 2. In this case, if you were to save Nora, then, plausibly, the additional person on the side of the many has a complaint, for you would thereby treat the case as though the additional person weren't even there. (Recall that we\u2019re supposing that Scanlon\u2019s argument described above succeeds.) So, you ought to do something appropriately responsive to the additional person\u2019s presence. Perhaps this will take the form of flipping a coin to determine whether to save Nora or the many; perhaps it will take the form of running a lottery heavily weighted on Nora\u2019s side\u2014the details won\u2019t matter here. What matters is that whatever such an act would be, it would presumably be \u201ccloser\u201d to saving the <i>n</i> than what it was permissible to do when <i>n</i> = 1 (namely, saving Nora outright).</p><p>But now imagine iterating this process over and over, increasing the size of <i>n</i> by 1 each time. Eventually, we think, you\u2019ll get to a point where outright saving the <i>n</i> is the only acceptable thing to do. This suggests that Scanlonian contractualism can accommodate some aggregation of lesser bads, at least if Scanlon\u2019s argument for saving the greater number is successful. We note, though, that this \u201citeration\u201d argument doesn\u2019t commit you to <i>full</i>&nbsp;aggregation of the sort that\u2019s incompatible with (say) the intuitive verdict in <i>Transmitter Room</i>. If you can prevent Nora\u2019s death or n <i>papercuts</i>&nbsp;(each had by a different person), then no matter how big <i>n</i> is, each papercut plausibly counts as an <i>irrelevant utility</i>, (cf. <a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/book/27604/chapter-abstract/197662999?redirectedFrom%3Dfulltext\"><u>Kamm 1998</u></a>) in virtue of how much less significant it is than Nora\u2019s death, and so ought to be ignored for purposes of determining which group to save.</p><h3><strong>Step 2</strong></h3><p>We now argue that, given contractualism, what goes morally for grave otherwise certain harms and comparatively tiny otherwise certain harms, on the one hand, also goes morally for probabilities of harms and comparatively tiny probabilities of harms of roughly equal magnitudes, on the other.</p><p>We first make an assumption about contractualism: The most plausible version of contractualism is (some version of) <i>ex ante</i>&nbsp;contractualism, hereafter \u201cEAC.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflgwwqae69o\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlgwwqae69o\">[15]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;According to EAC, the strength of a person\u2019s claim to your doing some act is grounded at least partly in the difference between the EV for this person of your doing this act and the EV for this person of your not doing this act.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7f7762d1ygk\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7f7762d1ygk\">[16]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;EAC helps to explain why, in <i>Transmitter Room</i>, Jones has a much stronger claim to your assisting him than does any other person to your assisting her instead, and thus also why aiding Jones is the only way of acting available to you that would be justifiable to others: For all <i>X</i>, where <i>X</i>&nbsp;ranges over all people other than Jones, (EV<i><sub>Jones</sub></i>(assisting Jones) - EV<i><sub>Jones</sub></i>(not assisting Jones)) &gt;&gt; (EV<i><sub>X</sub></i>(assisting <i>X</i>) - EV<i><sub>X</sub></i>(not assisting <i>X</i>)).</p><p>EAC also helps to justify, from a contractualist perspective, certain attractive interventions in which very small risks of serious harms are imposed on large groups of people, even when doing so foreseeably causes some such harms. For example, as Frick (<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/papa.12058\">2015</a>) points out, EAC seems well-placed to vindicate <i>mass vaccination</i>&nbsp;programs in which very small independent risks of very serious harms are imposed on many people who receive the vaccines, with the all-but-certain consequence that <i>some</i>&nbsp;people will suffer these very serious harms: It\u2019s often in the <i>ex ante</i>&nbsp;interest of each would-be vaccinated person to get the vaccine in question, even though it\u2019s obviously not in the <i>ex post</i>&nbsp;interest of anyone who ends up getting seriously harmed by such a vaccine to get one. Such vaccination programs can thus plausibly be taken to be justifiable to all affected individuals <i>ex ante</i>&nbsp;even if they end up causing serious harms to some. (As Frick also notes, <i>ex post</i>&nbsp;contractualists have a comparatively difficult time accommodating such interventions; given <i>ex post</i>&nbsp;contractualism, it seems that those who end up harmed by such interventions have legitimate complaints.)</p><p>Given EAC, it seems that just as some very serious otherwise certain harms morally outweigh any number of comparatively tiny otherwise certain harms, individual probabilities of harms morally outweigh any number of individual comparatively tiny probabilities of harms (faced by different individuals) of roughly equal magnitude. Consider this case:</p><blockquote><p><i><strong>Different Probabilities</strong></i><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Amy has probability .5 of dying within the next hour. 200 other people each have probability .01 of dying within the next hour. Death would be no worse or less bad for anyone among these 201 people than for anyone else among these 201 people. You can reduce Amy\u2019s probability of dying within the next hour to 0 or do the same for the 200, but you can\u2019t do this for all 201 people.</p></blockquote><p>Given EAC, Amy\u2019s claim to your eliminating her probability of dying within the next hour probably morally outweighs the competing claims. This is because, given EAC, Amy\u2019s .5 probability of death probably relates morally to each .01 probability of death possessed by the 200 as Jones\u2019s electric shocks relate morally to the 10 minutes of frustration that the World Cup final viewers would experience if you were to aid Jones. Amy\u2019s claim trumps each claim with which it competes, just as Jones\u2019s claim trumps each claim with which it competes. These considerations suggest a general lesson: Given EAC, you ought to make reductions in some people\u2019s probabilities of suffering harms rather than making comparatively tiny reductions in even far more people\u2019s probabilities of suffering harms of roughly equal magnitude. This completes Step 2 of our argument.</p><p>Just as the contractualist doesn\u2019t need to hold that one otherwise certain harm lexically morally outweighs any number of even arbitrarily slightly less serious otherwise certain harms, the contractualist doesn\u2019t need to hold (and our argument doesn\u2019t require) that, for any 0 &lt; <i>n</i> &lt; <i>n</i>+ \u2264 1, one instance of probability <i>n</i>+ of a harm of a given magnitude lexically morally outweighs any number of instances of probability <i>n</i> of harm of roughly equal magnitude. The contractualist can allow (and our argument is compatible with its being the case) that you ought to eliminate the probabilities of death possessed by 1,000 people who each have .49 probabilities of death rather than eliminate the .5 probability of death possessed by one other person.</p><h3><strong>Step 3</strong></h3><p>In this final step of our argument, we\u2019ll defend these two claims:</p><ol><li>If you donate to the global poor, then you\u2019ll thereby cause several people to undergo reductions in their probabilities of suffering a serious harm (death from malaria, say), <i>whereas</i></li><li>If you try to mitigate x-risk, then you\u2019ll thereby cause a much larger number of people to undergo <i>comparatively tiny</i>&nbsp;reductions in their probabilities of suffering a harm of roughly equal magnitude (death from asteroid collision with the earth, say).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref81fpslds4db\"><sup><a href=\"#fn81fpslds4db\">[17]</a></sup></span></li></ol><p>Claim (1) would be obvious, or close to it, if trying to help the global poor were a matter of handing 1,000 bednets to 1,000 needy persons standing in front of you who will otherwise certainly die of malaria if not given the bednets and who will certainly live for many more happy years if given the bednets. And some philanthropic acts may indeed be nearly this direct in character (e.g., cash transfers). But donating to support AMF-like interventions ordinarily doesn\u2019t take such a form. For most philanthropists, it's more like randomly selecting <i>n</i>&nbsp;people in some region of the world each to receive a bednet.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvgfzouhj7n9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvgfzouhj7n9\">[18]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This means that the pool of potential beneficiaries of such an intervention is very large, even if the number of actual beneficiaries is comparatively small and the individual reduction in the probability of harm that\u2019s secured for each of the potential beneficiaries isn\u2019t very large. Nevertheless, the diffuse and uncertain character of your act shouldn\u2019t prevent us from acknowledging that donating to help the global poor decreases the probability of suffering a serious harm for each person in the pool of potential beneficiaries (even if these probability reductions are fairly small). This conclusion is enough to establish (1).</p><p>How about (2)? Restricting our attention to people, there are two groups of potential beneficiaries here: currently existing people and non-existent people. The currently existing people are the simple case. Here, it\u2019s straightforwardly true that you\u2019ll benefit a much larger number of people via trying to mitigate x-risk, as every currently existing person enjoys a reduction in their probability of suffering a significant harm (death). However, the beneficiaries of AMF-like interventions face the same harm. Moreover, the probability of providing any benefit to every currently existing person is very low by comparison. So, (2) is true for currently existing people.</p><p>What about non-existent people? Here, the case for (2) seems even stronger. Suppose we think of non-existent people as <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nonexistent-objects/\"><u>non-existent objects</u></a>\u2014things that, in some sense, haven\u2019t acquired the property of existence. (This might be an <i>inaccurate</i>&nbsp;way to think of them, but it might nevertheless be an <i>innocent</i>&nbsp;way for present purposes.) Once we think of non-existent people this way, we should allow that there are very, very many non-existent, merely possible people, and that many (perhaps, strictly speaking, all) of them will undergo an expected decrease in risk of personal disaster as a result of your trying to mitigate x-risk. However, it seems inescapable that the biggest expected risk reductions that you\u2019ll secure for any of these individuals will be <i>much smaller</i>&nbsp;than the biggest risk reductions that you\u2019ll secure for at least some individuals by donating to help the global poor.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsxk2pho2okj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsxk2pho2okj\">[19]</a></sup></span></p><p>There are two main considerations that recommend this conclusion.</p><p><i>First</i>, the probability, relative to your current evidence, that any given non-existent individual will exist is extremely small. The simple argument for this: If men produce 2 trillion sperm in their lifetimes and women have some 350,000 eggs, the odds of any particular individual coming into existence <i>even fixing the parents </i>are minuscule.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefavdqshhcz5\"><sup><a href=\"#fnavdqshhcz5\">[20]</a></sup></span></p><p><i>Second</i>, by hypothesis, your intervention yields a very small reduction of the probability of a disaster of the sort targeted by your intervention (asteroid collision with the earth, say). These considerations support the conclusion that, in trying to mitigate x-risk, you don\u2019t confer on any individual a risk reduction of serious harm that is more than tiny compared to at least some of the risk reductions of roughly equally serious harms that you confer on individuals in donating to support AMF-like interventions. Hence, whether we focus on currently existing or non-existent people, (2) looks plausible.</p><p>Someone might object as follows:</p><blockquote><p>All this depends on the risk of extinction and the amount of that risk that we can reduce. Sure, the probability of an extinction-causing asteroid strike may be very low; sure, we may not be able to do much to reduce the probability of at least some such asteroids hitting Earth. However, many people think that other risks are <i>much </i>higher\u2014e.g., risks due to misaligned AI\u2014and our ability to mitigate those risks much greater. So, while global poverty work may beat x-risk work for non-existent individuals, given the low probability that any one of them comes into existence, global poverty work doesn\u2019t obviously beat x-risk work for currently existing individuals.</p></blockquote><p>This objection is fair: the argument indeed turns on the relative magnitudes of both the risks of serious harm (death) and the expected risk reductions. However, it\u2019s important to recognize two points. First, apart from AI-related threats, the standard view is that the risk of extinction is quite low in absolute terms (Ord famously estimates the threat of an extinction-causing asteroid strike at 1/1,000,000 and the highest non-AI anthropogenic threat at 1/30.) Moreover, it\u2019s common to assume that efforts to reduce the risk of extinction might reduce it by one basis point\u2014i.e., 1/10,000. So, multiplying through, we are talking about quite low probabilities. Of course, the probability that any particular poor child will die due to malaria may be very low as well, but the probability of making a difference is quite high. So, on a per-individual basis, which is what matters given contractualism, donating to AMF-like interventions looks good.</p><p>Second, and turning our attention to AI-related extinction events, we should just concede: if the probability of extinction is high enough and the difference you can make large enough, then yes, that sort of x-risk work <i>clearly </i>beats global poverty work even given contractualism. However, there are some key caveats here.</p><p>To start, the probability of extinction needs to be high enough <i>to affect currently existing humans</i>. Otherwise, the point we made about the low probability of any particular non-existent individual\u2019s coming into existence will be decisive.</p><p>Next, and again, reducing risk by one basis point will result in a significant discount of the ostensible benefit (preventing death).</p><p>Finally, there is massive disagreement about the odds of there being an AI-related extinction event in the next several decades, with many estimates being quite low indeed (as demonstrated by <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/announcing-the-winners-of-the-2023-open-philanthropy-ai-worldviews-contest/%23:~:text%3DIn%2520March%25202023%252C%2520we%2520launched,transformative%2520AI%2520systems%2520could%2520pose.\"><u>Open Philanthropy\u2019s recent AI Worldview Contest</u></a>).<i>&nbsp;</i>So, <i>some </i>people may have views about the level of risk and their prospects for mitigating it such that, even given contractualism, x-risk work beats global poverty work. However, we doubt that most do. So, we submit that most people should think that (A) if you donate to AMF-like interventions, then you\u2019ll thereby cause several people to undergo reductions in their probabilities of suffering a serious harm, whereas (B) if you try to mitigate x-risk, then you\u2019ll thereby cause a much larger number of people to under comparatively tiny reductions in their probabilities of suffering a harm of roughly equal magnitude.</p><p>This completes Step 3 of our argument.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpqjj2ytcuz8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpqjj2ytcuz8\">[21]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Together, steps 1\u20133 yield the verdict that, given contractualism, you ought to do (Poor) over (Extinction), other relevant things equal. And we can generalize beyond this conclusion: A contractualist perspective will generally encourage philanthropic interventions reducing present people\u2019s probabilities of suffering great harms over interventions reducing even far more numerous not-yet-existent people\u2019s much smaller probabilities of suffering comparably sized harms.</p><h2><strong>3.2. S-risk Interventions?</strong></h2><p>So far, we\u2019ve made a contractualist case for helping the global poor over x-risk work. But some <i>suffering </i>risk (s-risk) interventions might try to reduce the threat of harms that would be <i>far worse</i>&nbsp;than even the worst harms faced by the global poor. For example, death due to malaria is very bad, but it would be far worse to spend decades or centuries being tortured by sadistic misaligned AI. Presumably, some interventions targeting <i>s-risks</i>&nbsp;are at least partly aimed at reducing risks of relevantly similar outcomes.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref47tae2lcyb3\"><sup><a href=\"#fn47tae2lcyb3\">[22]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Moreover, it\u2019s arguable that, given contractualism, A can have a stronger claim to your assistance than B does in virtue of the fact that you\u2019re in a position to make a <i>small</i>&nbsp;reduction in A\u2019s probability of suffering a <i>horrendous</i>&nbsp;harm and you\u2019re in a position to make a <i>much larger</i>&nbsp;reduction in B\u2019s probability of suffering a <i>great but not horrendous</i>&nbsp;harm. For example, it\u2019s plausible that, given contractualism, if you can reduce A\u2019s probability of being kept alive and tortured for 50 years and then killed from .0002 to .0001 or you can reduce B\u2019s probability of dying now from .2 to .1, then A has a stronger claim to your assistance than B.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxfg5dcehofg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxfg5dcehofg\">[23]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;If this is correct, then it might be that some s-risk interventions that make tiny differences to people\u2019s probabilities of suffering the harms that they target are preferable, given contractualism, to some interventions targeting the global poor that make much larger differences to people\u2019s probabilities of suffering the harms that they target.</p><p>This complication doesn\u2019t undermine our argument that EAC supports trying to help the global poor over mitigating x-risk. Rather, the present complication brings out that some future-oriented interventions might be relevantly dissimilar from attempts to mitigate x-risk. In so doing, it raises the question of whether it might be appropriate, given contractualism, to finance interventions targeting some extremely remote s-risks, in particular risks of horrendous <i>individual</i>&nbsp;sufferings, over interventions aiding the present global poor.</p><p>Again, everything will come down to the probabilities. We grant that, given contractualism, a person facing a small risk of a fate far worse than death <i>could</i>&nbsp;have a stronger claim to your assistance than another person facing a far greater risk of (\u201cmere\u201d) death. However, the probability of these kinds of s-risks may be very low. After all, the relevant probability here isn't just the probability of misaligned AI, but the probability of a very specific kind of misalignment, a considerable amount of power, the AI being able to create suffering that's orders of magnitude worse than death (to offset the low probability of the situation in the first place), etc.</p><p>On top of all that, it's important to consider that when the probability of negative utility gets sufficiently low, contractualists may well have an independent reason to dismiss it as irrelevant utility, as mentioned earlier. After all, it would be very surprising if contractualists were willing to accept expected value theory, where <i>any </i>decrease in probability can be offset by a corresponding increase in the (dis)value of the option in question. In brief, this is because the point of discounting possible harms by their probabilities is <i>not</i> to satisfy the axioms of a particular decision theory; instead, it's to capture what counts as reasonable within a (perhaps somewhat idealized) community, as the ultimate goal here is some kind of justifiability to others. Just imagine someone trying to justify his decision not to spare a child from contracting malaria <i>to that very child </i>by saying that he thought was more important to make a marginal difference to the already-extraordinarily-low probability of some future people\u2019s suffering intensely due to malicious AI. Even if the per-individual EV of the s-risk effort is higher, the justification seems quite strained.</p><p>We conclude that contractualism generally favors interventions targeting the global poor over x-risk and s-risk interventions.</p><p>In the rest of this post, we extend our discussion to justice-oriented interventions.</p><h1><strong>4. Injustice-targeting and Special-relations-based Interventions</strong></h1><p>We\u2019ve argued that contractualism recommends interventions like AMF over x-risk interventions. But someone might worry that, in fact, contractualism recommends neither type of intervention, instead preferring interventions targeting injustices&nbsp;and interventions based on special relations. The thought goes: because contractualism prizes fairness and justifiability to others, it will strongly prefer interventions that address unfairness and are sensitive to special duties to the near and dear. What should the contractualist say here?</p><p>Consider, to take just one prominent example of an injustice-focused intervention, the much-discussed possibility of providing reparations for slavery&nbsp;to present-day African-Americans with ancestors who were slaves in the antebellum U.S. South. The present question, applied to reparations, is whether EAC implies that (American) philanthropists ought to fund efforts to lobby the US Government to pay reparations over, say, funding efforts to help the global poor. If EAC is committed to the priority of justice-based claims over welfare-based claims, then, perhaps, philanthropists would be wrong to prioritize the latter over the former.</p><p>There are several assumptions baked into this suggestion, but let's focus on the basic question of whether EAC invariably requires the priority of justice-based claims over welfare-based claims, as that will suffice for our purposes. With that in mind, consider this case:</p><blockquote><p><i><strong>Window/Agony</strong></i><strong>.</strong>&nbsp;Bill recently threw a rock through Ann\u2019s window out of pure malice. Bill now has the ability either to fix Ann\u2019s window or to prevent Carl, a total stranger, from suffering an extremely slow and agonizing death, but he cannot do both of these things.</p></blockquote><p>Obviously, Bill has wronged Ann (in a particularly direct and objectionable manner), and Ann has a claim of corrective justice against Bill that he fix her window (among other things). Nevertheless, we find it plausible that <i>Bill ought to save Carl</i>. Our core thought is straightforward: Carl\u2019s plight is so much more serious than Ann\u2019s that Bill ought to help him rather than satisfy Ann\u2019s (entirely valid) claim of corrective justice against him. (Given the circumstances, we also find it plausible that it would be immoral for Ann to press her claim against Bill.) This suggests that claims of corrective justice do not <i>necessarily</i>&nbsp;trump purely welfare-grounded claims. We need to consider the strengths of the claims on both sides. The case of American slavery is interesting precisely because it seems to ground such strong justice-based claims. However, even in this case, it isn\u2019t clear the strength of the claim of any current would-be beneficiary of reparations is strong than, say, the claim of a child who would die from malaria without aid. And if that\u2019s right, then the mere existence of justice-based claims doesn\u2019t immediately show that philanthropists ought to act in any particular way.</p><p>Welfare and injustice aren't the only possible contributors to claim strength. For example, some find it plausible that our fellow citizens have special claims to our assistance grounded in our <i>co-citizenship</i>. More generally, <i>special relations</i>&nbsp;between a needy party and the potential benefactor are often taken to amplify the strength of the needy party\u2019s claim to assistance. What should the contractualist say about interventions sensitive to such relations?</p><p>Considering all possible special relations that give rise to special claim-strengths would obviously be impossible in the present context, but we think that we can defend some general claims about this topic without getting too far into the weeds. In short, you don\u2019t need to dismiss the validity of such contributors to claim strength to be skeptical that they yield plausible contractualism-friendly justifications for philanthropic interventions targeting <i>much-better-off</i>&nbsp;individuals who satisfy the relevant conditions over <i>much-worse-off</i>&nbsp;individuals who don\u2019t, or ones securing <i>much smaller</i>&nbsp;EV increases for individuals who satisfy the relevant conditions over ones securing <i>much larger</i>&nbsp;EV increases for individuals who don\u2019t.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreft2d74b6t1d9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnt2d74b6t1d9\">[24]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>For example, even if co-citizenship is a claim-strength enhancer, we doubt that a plausible contractualist case can be made for aiding homeless people in your own affluent nation over far worse-off people on the other side of the planet.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdxu01lsi1g8\"><sup><a href=\"#fndxu01lsi1g8\">[25]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Welfare considerations, taken on their own, are not everything, given most versions of contractualism, but they are extremely important. And so we suspect that, given contractualism, interventions like AMF will generally fare better than interventions sensitive to special relations like co-citizenship targeting much better-off people and yielding much smaller EV increases. By contrast, interventions targeting (say) homeless people in your own nation might well secure significantly larger EV increases for worse-off people than x-risk or injustice-targeting interventions, and so might well fare better than such interventions, by the lights of contractualism.</p><h1><strong>5. Conclusion</strong></h1><p>Many EAs may be more sympathetic to some form of consequentialism than they are to Scanlon\u2019s contractualism. Still, they might put some credence in a view of this kind. And if they do, then it\u2019s worth considering the implications of contractualism for cause prioritization. As we\u2019ve argued, we get quite a different picture than the one that stems from a general commitment to maximizing EV. Indeed, if contractualism is true, then there are many cases in which it would be <i>wrong</i>&nbsp;to maximize EV. Instead, insofar as contractualism supports maximization, it tells us to maximize something like \u201cthe relevant strength-weighted moral claims that are addressed per dollar spent\u201d\u2014where, as we\u2019ve seen, the strength adjustment involves discounting the claim by the probability of being able to help the individual in question. Since those probabilities are very low for any particular future individual, and since contractualism rejects the view that a sufficient number of extremely weak claims can sum to outweigh a very strong claim, the view generally favors reliably helping the global poor (whose claims are often very strong) over many other options.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Acknowledgments</strong></h1><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/c5m8vAxpJgJJ2XGFu/yyzoqjvtmgntnoqgfhww\"></figure><p>The post was written by Bob Fischer and an anonymous collaborator.

Given as much, the probability of benefitting future people is much higher. However, this isn't a plausible move for contractualists to make. The appeal of contractualism is partially based on its ability to explain why we care about morality at all: namely, in terms of the value we place on mutual recognition and acting in ways that are justifiable to others. However, there's a psychological constraint here: most people don't care about justifying themselves to people who might live in the far future. So, if we go for the de dicto interpretation of contractualism, we end up with a view that creates the very problem that contractualism was supposed to solve: that is, we end up with a moral view where the rightness and wrongness of actions is based on a property ((un)justifiability to others) that is too far from our actual concerns.

He is known for his voluntary poverty and his love for animals and nature. The Roman Catholic church venerates Francis as the patron saint of animals and ecology, among other things, and many Catholic churches hold ceremonies to bless animals on his feast day. In this post, I want to examine Christianity and animal welfare through this influential figure in Western Christianity. I focus especially on how historical Christianity can give rise to concern for animal welfare without the influence of a modern, secular worldview, and in what ways this looks different from the modern animal rights movement.</p><p>Animal welfare concerns are often linked to the animal rights movement. The movement is commonly perceived as a secular phenomenon in its current form.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1kvszuqk22z\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1kvszuqk22z\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>Its seminal text, <i>Animal Liberation</i>, was written by atheist philosopher Peter Singer. Christianity has often been cast in the role of a villain by claims that the teaching of human dominion over animals has caused cruel exploitation. This view is often paired with a narrative of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_circle_expansion\">moral circle expansion</a> over time: humans originally cared only about their closest social group, but this gradually extended to caring about larger units such as their nation, then all human beings, and now the circle is expanding to include all sentient beings regardless of their species. Not everyone in the animal rights movement shares these views, but in the Effective Altruism movement, the dominant approach is secular and naturalist, <a href=\"https://utilitarianism.net/guest-essays/utilitarianism-and-nonhuman-animals/\">utilitarian</a>, and informed by the expanding moral circle narrative.</p><p>Medieval <a href=\"https://www.ccel.org/ccel/ugolino/flowers.html\">stories about Francis</a> paint a different picture of Christian attitudes towards animals and the expansion of the moral circle. Many of the stories feature Francis interacting with animals, such as preaching to a flock of birds, saving lambs destined for slaughter, and miraculously taming a man-eating wolf in the town of Gubbio. Francis calls animals his brothers and sisters and considers their needs. He includes them in his moral circle.&nbsp; The stories also seem to give animals some moral agency. In the story of the wolf of Gubbio, for example, Francis negotiates a pact between the wolf and the citizens of the town. In the story about preaching to birds, the birds listen and respond with appreciation. There is also a similar story about Francis preaching to fish. High cognitive capacity is attributed to animals, though there is a distinct air of the supernatural in these encounters.&nbsp;</p><p>Including animals in the circle of moral concern is an obvious overlap with modern animal rights and animal welfare thinking. By granting advanced cognitive capabilities to animals, the stories mirror modern scientific findings about animal cognition, though they go further than modern animal rights thinking in granting animals moral agency.</p><p>Despite the overlap, there are differences in the underlying worldviews. In Francis\u2019 famous <a href=\"http://faculty.webster.edu/barrettb/canticle.htm\">Canticle to the Sun</a>, all things are portrayed as created by God and united in praising him, with the sun, moon, and wind also addressed as brothers and sisters. There is a unity based on not just physical or mental similarities but a spiritual kinship stemming from a common origin and purpose in God. Still, not all of creation is the same. The idea of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_chain_of_being\">Great Chain of Being</a> is not expressed in the Canticle, but it was commonplace in medieval Christian thought. In this view, all things exist in a hierarchical continuum from God to lifeless matter, with humans around the middle above animals and below angels. In Christian theology of creation, humans are also distinguished from animals by being created in the image and likeness of God. Modern animal welfare thinking, in contrast, takes place in a framework that sees no such inherent difference between humans and animals and rejects metaphysical categorisation.</p><p>With its doctrine of creation, Christianity necessarily carries with itself a more metaphysical worldview, even if the scholastic systematisation of the Great Chain is abandoned. But animals occupying a different category in the metaphysical world order did not stop Francis from showing them compassion. This seems similar to how he deliberately crossed social boundaries, also seen as something close to an immutable natural order, by identifying with the poor.</p><p>Francis\u2019 concern for animals is portrayed positively as a saintly feature \u2013 an argument for Roman Catholics and others who see Francis as exemplary to do likewise. The stories also show that this kind of attitude towards animals can rise in a premodern Christian worldview. Obviously, all Christians don\u2019t fully share the worldview of the culture that handed down these stories, but there are enough common elements in the doctrine of creation and God\u2019s compassion to arrive at similar conclusions. God showed compassion to humans, and this is what Francis sought to imitate in his identification with the poor. Internalising the kind of attitude portrayed in this foundational Christian narrative provides a basis for compassion towards animals because animals are also part of God\u2019s creation, <a href=\"https://christandcounterfactuals.substack.com/p/should-christians-be-concerned-about-animal-welfare-part-1\">God cares about animals</a>, and human dominion over them should mirror God\u2019s goodness towards his creation. But from a secular and naturalist animal rights perspective, the Christian approach with metaphysical categorisation and inherent differences between humans and animals probably remains fundamentally <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/speciesism\">speciesist</a>.</p><p>The \u201cFrancis perspective\u201d I have sketched here seems more accommodating to concerns for justice, relationships, and the inherent value of individual lives than a purely utilitarian approach. From the \u201cFrancis perspective\u201d, what is done to animals in modern intensive agriculture is also a form of oppression and an affront to their nature as beings created by God, as well as a perversion of the dominion relationship between humans and animals as God originally intended it.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>After this more theoretical discussion, I\u2019d like to turn to the image of Francis at the factory farm. What kind of a discussion would the Francis depicted in the stories have with a sow confined to a <a href=\"https://thehumaneleague.org/article/pig-gestation-crates\">gestation crate</a>? How would he preach to a hall full of <a href=\"https://thehumaneleague.org/article/broiler-chickens\">broiler chickens</a>? It is hard to imagine him relating to them in any other way than as suffering individuals in need of consolation. A man who is moved to pity by the bleating of lambs carried to the market would be shaken by the fates of animals in factory farms. If you address birds as your brothers, how could you not pity your kin closed in <a href=\"https://thehumaneleague.org/article/battery-cages\">battery cages</a>?</p><p>Though Francis was not a vegan or even a vegetarian (as a mendicant monk he accepted any food he was given), I doubt he would see current Western levels of animal consumption as good. The environmental, medical, and animal welfare harms of mass animal agriculture are larger than ever before due to the enormous scale of factory farming. The angle of poverty is also significant since many of the negative effects factory farming has on humans hit the poorest people hardest. I find it likely that Francis would think current Western eating habits constitute greed and gluttony in light of these effects.</p><p>In the end, I believe many of the differences between modern secular animal rights activists and Francis of Assisi disappear at the factory farm. Both approaches lead to similar practical conclusions about the modern practices of animal consumption and intense animal agriculture. Compassion towards animals unites the 13th-century Francis and 2020\u2019s secular animal advocates despite their differences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn1kvszuqk22z\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref1kvszuqk22z\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>In contrast, the early anti-cruelty movement in the 1800's had many prominent Christian advocates.</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "EA for Christians"}}, {"_id": "R5r2FPYTZGDzWdJEY", "title": "How to get wealthier folks involved in mutual aid?", "postedAt": "2023-10-13T12:10:35.200Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi everyone!

Compatibility between an applicant and their proposed project, including personal interest and enthusiasm, plays a crucial role in the project\u2019s success. Therefore, we discourage tailoring your applications to match the higher tiers of this list.</li><li>My own view is that the conceptual grounding for EAIF grants is a bit worse than that for LTFF grants. Thus, the reasoning behind previous EAIF grants might be a bit harder to generalize than for LTFF grants.&nbsp;</li><li>I anticipate a higher rate of staff and strategic direction changes at EAIF compared to LTFF in the next six months. Consequently, I predict that decision-making for EAIF grants will vary more from past trends than decisions for LTFF grants.</li><li>My lesser familiarity with EAIF may affect my enthusiasm in this write-up; adjust your credences accordingly.</li></ol><p>Again, please see the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/\"><u>notes on my other post on LTFF</u></a> for more explanations, methodology, and other caveats.</p><h1>Grant tiers</h1><p>EAIF\u2019s primary aim in awarding grants is to improve the capacity of people and projects that follow the principles of effective altruism. Grantmakers try to evaluate each grant according to their subjective worldviews and their sense of whether spending $X on the grant is a sufficiently good use of limited resources given that they only have $Y total to spend on EA goals.&nbsp;</p><p>In the tiers below, I illustrate the types of projects (and corresponding grant costs<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefebqwokv1358\"><sup><a href=\"#fnebqwokv1358\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;in brackets) that EAIF would potentially finance conditional upon EAIF raising that much money over the next six months. For each tier, I list only projects that EAIF likely wouldn't finance if their fundraising only met the preceding tier's total. For example, if EAIF raised $1.2 million, they would likely fund everything in the $100,000 and $1M tiers, but only a small subset (up to $200,000) of projects in the $5M tier, and nothing in the $10M tier.</p><p>To put it differently, as funding for EAIF increases, the threshold for applications they would consider funding decreases, as there is more funding to go around.</p><p>The grants below are fictional grants created from blending real grants and adding some noise to anonymize further. For example, if EAIF gave grants to EA Oregon and EA Oklahoma, I might anonymize by modifying the dollar amounts and say the grant was to \u201cEA British Columbia\u201d, on the grounds that British Columbia has a similar population and GDP to Oregon and Oklahoma. Of course, this does not necessarily mean EAIF (or I) endorse or fund work done specifically by EA British Columbia.

We mainly give quantitative point estimates (e.g., our cost-effectiveness estimates) even though confidence intervals would better reflect the underlying distribution and uncertainty. We hope this will be seen as&nbsp;<i>one</i> line of research into this area (that has many flaws) and would be keen to learn about other perspectives.<br>&nbsp;</p><h1>Summary</h1><p>This post explores the promise of&nbsp;<i>the Development of Impact-Oriented Individuals (DIOI)</i>. We present our research on the extent to which increasing the well-being, character, and productivity of high-impact individuals through interventions such as meditation courses, therapy, and coaching might be a particularly high-impact use of resources. We define DIOI as&nbsp;<i>i) Cost-effective and truth-seeking personal and professional development of ii) impact-oriented individuals.</i>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>What we did</strong></h3><p>To approximate the answer to this we:</p><ul><li>Created a model categorizing development areas for impact-oriented individuals based on surveys, interviews, research, and expert judgment. This led to the identification of five categories: Emotional Regulation and Mastery, Interpersonal Skills, Productivity, Professional Development, and Physical and mental needs. Each category has several areas of development, such as motivation, management, and depression.</li><li>Estimated the impact on productivity, the prevalence, the improvement potential, and the cost of promising interventions for the most relevant areas of development. The average productivity impact was 22%, and the average prevalence was 33%. We found that the average cost of effective interventions (largely identified via systematic reviews and RCTs) was ~$100/week investment over 21 weeks, and the average improvement potential was 39%.</li><li>Used these estimates to calculate the cost of an added FTE (per year) for an organization and for an individual.&nbsp;<strong>The expected cost per added FTE ranged from $25,000 to $75,000.</strong></li><li>Estimated the impact-adjusted dollar value for every dollar invested in the development of impact-oriented individuals.&nbsp;<strong>The estimates ranged from $1.2 to $3.7 for every dollar invested.&nbsp;</strong>However, while there are many cost-effective interventions with a better return on investment than $3.7 per every dollar spent, this makes it plausible that this could be a cost-effective way of spending altruistic money within the domain of field-building.</li><li>Considered counterarguments to investing in DIOI. We think the strongest counterargument is that other cause areas and interventions are more promising and that resources are best spent there.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We expect there to be many more promising ways of examining the case for investing in interventions that seek to develop impact-oriented people in the broadest sense. These would include examining the importance of habits and strategies used by altruistic peak performers, estimating the impact of other interventions (e.g., leadership training), and estimating the impact of qualities such as character (e.g., virtues like integrity or ambition) development. Therefore, we don\u2019t want to present this as \u201cthe case\u201d for activities in this area and hope that readers won\u2019t see this as conclusive findings.<br>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>What we recommend</strong></h3><p>Overall, given all the ways altruistic actors can allocate scarce resources, we don\u2019t think this is likely to be amongst the top ways of doing so. That said, we think that&nbsp;<i>some&nbsp;</i>amount of altruistic resources should be allocated to contribute to DIOI as it seems to be able to further important work in top cause areas (by increasing the number of FTEs). Based on this we make the following recommendations to different stakeholders:<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Leaders and HR professionals at organizations</u></strong></p><p>Our model suggests that organizations and individuals could gain an FTE at the price of ~ $25,000-$75,000 corresponding to a $1.2-$3.7 benefit per dollar invested in well-tailored development of their employees. This could include things such as leadership/management training, coaching, therapy, and mindfulness-based programs. This could be done by providing a development (or mental health) budget&nbsp;<i>and supporting employees in making good use of the budget.</i></p><p>Organizations that are low on resources can look for cheaper alternatives such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.betterup.com/blog/peer-coaching\"><u>peer-coaching</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.rethinkwellbeing.org/\">peer-guided mental health programs</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_group\"><u>mastermind groups</u></a> combined with cheap and effective digital interventions.</p><p><strong><u>Individuals who think they might benefit from these services</u></strong></p><p>Our models suggest that a well-tailored intervention lasting 21 weeks with an average total cost of ~ $2000/person could lead to an average increase in an individual\u2019s yearly output by 9%. This roughly corresponds to a $3.7 benefit per dollar invested in well-tailored development. We expect this to be particularly important for people working individually like individual AI safety researchers. This could include things such as (productivity) coaching, therapy, and mindfulness-based programs.&nbsp;</p><p>For those who are financially constrained, we expect significant benefits to be obtained via cheaper alternatives such as <a href=\"https://www.betterup.com/blog/peer-coaching\"><u>peer-coaching</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.rethinkwellbeing.org/\">peer-guided mental health programs</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_group\"><u>mastermind groups</u></a> combined with cheap and effective digital interventions.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><u>Practitioners and professionals working in this area</u></strong></p><p>If you\u2019re actively working with the development of impact-oriented individuals, you can consider familiarizing yourself with the&nbsp;five-factor model (see below) that categorizes development areas for impact-oriented individuals based on surveys, interviews, scientific literature, and expert judgment.&nbsp;</p><p>The model includes five categories: Emotional Regulation and Mastery, Interpersonal Excellence, Productivity, Professional Development, and Physical and mental needs.</p><p>We also created a more elaborate spreadsheet that includes considerations such as what might indicate that an individual would benefit from developing an area (e.g., stress) and how to measure it (e.g., the Perceived Stress Scale) (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1opkInYA5CwWZ29JmeOH0HrWPU5lGTTd1DowE29_50ys/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>1.1 Area of improvement estimates (elaborate)</u></a>). Most importantly, however, it seems that finding the right people and offering highly tailored solutions are key.</p><p>For those considering entering this area, we would recommend that you consider other options unless you think you have a strong personal fit for this. However, if you have a strong personal fit, this may be a top option conditional on you finding promising interventions and impact-oriented clients.</p><p>During our research, we also identified some ideas we\u2019d like to see:</p><ul><li>A high-quality recommender platform that can recommend promising services tailored to individual users. This would have some overlap with services like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mentalhealthnavigator.co.uk/providers\"><u>EA mental health navigator overview of providers</u></a>, Upgradable.org, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.clearerthinking.org/\"><u>Clearer Thinking</u></a>.</li><li>An eco-system of providers and services aiming to be the main provider to people pursuing high-impact careers.</li><li>High-quality content written on the topics of personal development, mental health, and similar as it relates to doing the most good.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><h1>Introduction</h1><p>This post explores the promise of&nbsp;<i>the Development of Impact-Oriented Individuals</i>. The main motivation was for Sebastian to examine something he felt could have the potential to be a cause area or simply just a promising way of bringing about more good in the world. So, he decided to research this further and contracted Amine Challouf for part of the process. \u201cWe\u201d will be used throughout the post but the majority of the post was written by Sebastian (Amine hasn't read all parts of the post and may not agree with some parts) and all mistakes are Sebastian\u2019s.</p><p>We present our research on the extent to which increasing the well-being and productivity of high-impact individuals through interventions such as meditation, therapy, and coaching might be a particularly high-impact use of resources. We hope this post will be valuable for the following audiences:</p><ul><li>Grant-makers who find it hard to reason clearly about funding things in this space.</li><li>Leaders and HR leads at organizations who find it hard to evaluate the value of personal and professional development, or who see the value, but don\u2019t know what to do about it.</li><li>Individuals who think they might benefit from services in this area find it hard to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of related initiatives - especially because it feels too fluffy and can trade off against work.</li><li>Professionals (e.g., coaches) working in this area who would like to inform their activities and have a potential way of thinking about the cost-effectiveness of related initiatives.<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><h1>What is the \u201cdevelopment of impact-oriented individuals\u201d?</h1><p>In order to clearly and rigorously explore the promise of the development of impact-oriented individuals, we need to define what's within and outside of scope. We\u2019ll do so by giving a brief definition, comparing that definition to a related set of areas, and giving concrete (yet simplified) case studies of what we\u2019d consider within and outside of scope.</p><p>We define the development of impact-oriented individuals (DIOI) as:</p><p><i>i) Cost-effective and truth-seeking personal and professional development of ii) impact-oriented individuals.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>By&nbsp;<i>truth-seeking,</i> we mean approaching this activity with epistemic humility and a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Scout-Mindset-People-Things-Clearly/dp/034942764X\"><u>Scout Mindset</u></a>. By&nbsp;<i>personal and professional development</i>, we mean interventions aimed at improving things such as mental health, (eudaimonic) well-being,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dictionary.apa.org/character\"><u>character</u></a>, productivity, and professional skills. By&nbsp;<i>impact-oriented individuals</i>, we mean people who are taking significant action based on impartial altruism (attempting to give equal weight to their beneficiaries regardless of when and where they exist) and truth-seeking. In principle, this is community-agnostic. However, we choose to focus on the Effective Altruism community, so the definition and data (e.g., surveys) are heavily grounded in that community.</p><h2>Compared to related areas</h2><p>To further delineate DIOI, we\u2019ll look at some similarities and differences between it and related areas.</p><h3>Table: Development of impact-oriented individuals (DIOI) compared to related areas</h3><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/onwk6xy05saolhqv2tw2\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/qsehylu0zrz4vndpd2pn 110w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/ijfsltgzflf8thlvp32v 190w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/nerbq9qiw8z9ln5g0s51 270w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/x35g0nrddkkwl5iqopvb 350w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/fvzxwzm9mvvt800nhubz 430w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/qomhyc6dl8qupv2m0w9d 510w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/fogrzvn4zoyw3cnzjmze 590w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/ri6rfalfh84pt33nqauo 670w\"><figcaption>&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>Table: <i>A simple diagram showing the relationship between the development of impact-oriented individuals and more established areas such as mental health.

Why is this case outside of scope? While bringing about flourishing in this person clearly has the highest intrinsic value to address, it\u2019s outside of scope as it\u2019s too severe and he\u2019s unlikely to become someone who can significantly affect the most pressing problems and valuable opportunities of our time.

We\u2019ll do so by creating a model that categorizes the development areas (e.g., depression) for impact-oriented individuals based on surveys, interviews, research, and expert judgment. We can then use this to generate relevant estimates that can be used to create some cost-effectiveness estimates.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>The five-factor model of the development of impact-oriented individuals</h2><p>To think more clearly about how to develop impact-oriented individuals, we contracted Amine Challouf to help us develop a model. The model seeks to create meaningful categories (e.g., emotional regulation and self-mastery) within this area. We believe that these categories are helpful to i) produce estimates that can enable us to understand the impact potential and ii) to use in a more applied way as part of providing interventions within this area.</p><p>More concretely, we formulated these categories on the basis of several sources of data and considerations including needs, skills, and bottlenecks reported in existing surveys within the EA community (~ 1000 respondents), interviews we conducted, relevant reports, scientific literature (ranging from cross-sectional studies to systematic reviews and RCTs), and own models and experiences as practitioners (coaches).<br>&nbsp;</p><p>That said, this categorization is tentative and should be seen more as a starting point for further research than a well-consolidated set of findings. For instance, there were many things we didn\u2019t include that are clearly valuable in practice and would be unfortunate not to include when needed. These include qualities such as ambition, collaborative spirit, general professional and personal experience (i.e., having a significant amount of experience from various walks of life), and conscientiousness/work ethics.</p><p><strong>Table: Description of the five-factor model of development of impact-oriented individuals</strong></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/rligtjukroyazwfj3zit\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/f6z4l4p8p5fukxgfr2kj 136w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/vkntozxua3hjbravbpf6 216w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/mj4tu0xd16vqfgomhu6a 296w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/opd1xcy8bx4xbenzclpc 376w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/ylt9gtpe1y8p9o8g0klv 456w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/oqqrurjwyrjzkvc7uhpr 536w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/y2o9mmx6vpinebeh1o7s 616w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/tewhqim8y8ehmgy92onr 696w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/cfss2rgcib0soi5ool9h 776w\"></figure><p>Table: <i>Each category has a general description of the area, the top areas of development associated with the category (mostly the items with the highest prevalence from various surveys), and examples of promising interventions related to the category.</i></p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Now that we have outlined some relevant high-level categories and areas of development, we can look for relevant estimates that can inform how cost-effective it might be to make progress in these areas. The most relevant estimates to establish are:</p><p><i>Estimates related to the effectiveness of the area of development:</i></p><ul><li><strong>Quantitative estimates of productivity effects</strong> associated with the area of improvement. This is mainly based on academic literature (primarily correlational) around the relationship between an area (e.g., anxiety) and productivity. Note these likely represent the upper bound as they\u2019re often estimates of more significant versions of the different areas of development (e.g., generalized anxiety) than the average survey respondent is experiencing.</li><li><strong>Prevalence of the area of improvement</strong> amongst impact-oriented individuals (in this case people within the EA community). This is primarily assessed based on self-reported survey data and, occasionally, anecdotal evidence. This is likely to be an overestimate due to selection effects amongst people who responded. In some cases, we\u2019ve discounted the estimates by 50% to make up for this.</li><li><strong>Potential improvements</strong> one can expect by addressing the area of development with promising interventions or services. We identified effective interventions (see&nbsp;<strong>Intervention identified</strong>) via systematic reviews and randomized controlled trials. Then, we found what proportion of the problem was solved via the intervention. For simplicity, we\u2019ll assume that the potential improvements will persist for one year and then revert completely.</li></ul><p><i>Estimates related to the cost of addressing the area of development:</i></p><ul><li><strong>Cost ($) per week of intervention/training</strong>. This is assessed based on our existing knowledge and research of promising services.</li><li><strong>Average duration of intervention or training (weeks).&nbsp;This is based on our existing knowledge, promising services, and academic literature.&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Instead of finding these estimates for all relevant areas of development (as listed in the survey), we identify five priority areas of development (one from each of the categories). You can see them here:<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Table: Estimates related to the cost and effectiveness of priority areas of development</strong></p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:100%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/blxa79ep6jgmdbr116lz\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/iifoztgborfg5pkvz24c 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/fjlakn9ogsbqfsby89ga 200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/mzhuixksalqpauy7rcbu 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/tubpfgaduf8bhr1jz0sj 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/xcgoxmevqusegjghovd3 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/mbqmsszqbfqtbahh8zfz 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/lxlte2zzceph0ecv0yra 700w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/al7gmnrjzvy6mw0yrptp 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/qbp50x3mmiyxec77cxrz 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rq5yvqzawgnGphvzM/mqwk9toyjsyt7qjqsb9b 950w\"></figure><p>Table: <i>Please refer to the page above for a detailed explanation of the different estimates.

Our model suggests that, with a significant investment of ~ $100/week over 21 weeks, there\u2019s a potential for improving the area of development by 39%, on average. While the averages are somewhat strange estimates, due to the variance, we use them to get a sense of the general cost-effectiveness of the \"portfolio\" of interventions. Ideally, we would use confidence intervals, instead of point estimates, to reflect the underlying distribution and uncertainty better. However, that\u2019s beyond the scope of this post and all but a few of these estimates are based on relevant resources (primarily scientific studies) so we feel reasonably confident that these estimates are directionally correct, though there will of course be significant case-by-case differences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For a case study of how some of these areas of development might affect individuals\u2019 productivity over the long run, please see Howie Lempel\u2019s account of his struggle with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/depression-anxiety-imposter-syndrome/#top\"><u>depression and anxiety</u></a>.</p><h3>How many additional FTEs can we expect to gain by investing in the development of organizations and individuals? (Cost-effectiveness)</h3><p>We can use the averages of estimates of the areas of development above to approximate the costs and effectiveness of investing in addressing these areas of development. There are many relevant effectiveness measures, but we think the most reasonable is full-time equivalent (FTE) of work done in a priority path per year. We can estimate FTEs based on the averages in the following way:</p><p>Quantitative Estimated Impact on Productivity*Prevalence*Potential improvements</p><p>We can do this for the following groups of impact-oriented individuals:</p><ul><li>An impact-oriented organization with around 10 people who are representative of the community as a whole.

One way of improving the cost-benefit would be to offer well-tailored services specifically to the proportion of people who are likely to benefit the most from it and are the most senior. This seems particularly feasible given that some organizations offer their employees mental health and development budgets.</p><p>For a selected individual, the cost-benefit looks much better at $3.7 for every dollar invested. While there are many cost-effective interventions with a better return on investment than $3.7 per every dollar spent, this makes it plausible that this could be a cost-effective way of spending altruistic money within the domain of field-building.</p><h1>Why this isn\u2019t important (negative effects)</h1><p>Now that we have explored some reasons for the importance of DIOI, let\u2019s consider some counterarguments.</p><h2>This risks being self-centered and at odds with doing the most good</h2><p>A counterargument is the concern that prioritizing personal and professional development may lead to self-centeredness and is fundamentally at odds with doing the most good as that involves putting others first. This could be particularly problematic if DIOI were viewed primarily as intrinsically valuable rather than instrumentally valuable (means to improve the lives of others). In some sense, it seems wrong to take care of oneself when there\u2019s a lot of suffering right now and too high probability of risks such as Existential risks. We do see a failure mode of \u201coverdoing\u201d investing in oneself. However, as the survey results indicate, many impact-oriented individuals have areas of development (including not being depressed or being highly inexperienced managers) that are clearly impeding their ability to do good. Relatedly, increasing well-being and developing one\u2019s character are likely to&nbsp;be <i>part of</i> what ultimately matters (including if it\u2019s done for oneself). Overall, we see this as a counterargument and something to watch out for but, on the margin, we don\u2019t think this is a strong counterargument to investing in oneself.</p><h2>Other cause areas and strategies are more promising</h2><p>Given the number of pressing cause areas and promising interventions and the big difference in impact between the best and the worst, one should have a very low prior that any one area or intervention is amongst the most promising. We think this is the strongest counterargument and we don\u2019t think DIOI is amongst the ten most important cause areas and think people should think twice before pursuing this professionally and rather consider direct work (e.g., AI governance). However, as suggested by the cost-effectiveness estimates, DIOI might be a good way of directing valuable resources (i.e., FTEs) toward important cause areas.</p><h1>Conclusion and recommendations</h1><p>We\u2019ve explored the case for considering the development of impact-oriented individuals as an impactful way of improving the world.</p><p>We define DIOI as&nbsp;<i>i) Cost-effective and truth-seeking personal and professional development of ii) impact-oriented individuals.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>To understand the value of pursuing interventions in this area, we</p><ul><li>Created a model categorizing development areas for impact-oriented individuals based on surveys, interviews, research, and expert judgment. This led to the identification of five categories: Emotional Regulation and Mastery, Interpersonal Skills, Productivity, Professional Development, and Physical and mental needs. Each category has several areas of development, such as motivation, management, and depression.</li><li>Estimated the impact on productivity, the prevalence, the improvement potential, and cost of promising interventions for the most relevant areas of development. The average productivity impact was 22%, and the average prevalence was 33%. We found that the average cost of effective interventions (largely identified via systematic reviews and RCTs) was ~$100/week investment over 21 weeks, and the average improvement potential was 39%.</li><li>Used these estimates to calculate the cost of an added FTE (per year) for an organization and for an individual.&nbsp;<strong>The expected cost per added FTE ranged from $25,000 to $75,000.</strong></li><li>Estimated the impact-adjusted dollar value for every dollar invested in the development of impact-oriented individuals.&nbsp;<strong>The estimates ranged from $1.2 to $3.7 for every dollar invested.&nbsp;</strong>However, while there are many cost-effective interventions with a better return on investment than $3.7 per every dollar spent, this makes it plausible that this could be a cost-effective way of spending altruistic money within the domain of field-building.</li><li>Considered counterarguments to investing in DIOI. We think the strongest counterargument is that other cause areas and interventions are more promising and that resources are best spent there.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We expect there to be many more promising ways of examining the case for investing in interventions that seek to develop impact-oriented people in the broadest sense. These would include examining the importance of habits and strategies used by altruistic peak performers, estimating the impact of other interventions (e.g., leadership training), and estimating the impact of qualities such as character (e.g., virtues like integrity or ambition) development. Therefore, we don\u2019t want to present this as \u201cthe case\u201d for activities in this area and hope that readers won\u2019t see this as conclusive findings.</p><h3><strong>Recommendations</strong></h3><p>Overall, given all the ways altruistic actors can allocate scarce resources, we don\u2019t think this is likely to be amongst the top ways of doing so. That said, we think that&nbsp;<i>some&nbsp;</i>amount of altruistic resources should be allocated to contribute to DIOI as it can further important work in top cause areas (by increasing the number of FTEs).&nbsp;</p><p>Based on this we make the following recommendations to different stakeholders:</p><p><strong><u>Leaders and HR professionals at organizations</u></strong></p><p>Our model suggests that organizations and individuals could gain an FTE at the price of ~ $25,000-$75,000 corresponding to a $1.2-$3.7 benefit per dollar invested in well-tailored development of their employees. This could include things such as leadership/management training, coaching, therapy, and mindfulness-based programs. This could be done by providing a development (or mental health) budget&nbsp;<i>and supporting employees in making good use of the budget.</i></p><p>Organizations that are low on resources can look for cheaper alternatives such as <a href=\"https://www.betterup.com/blog/peer-coaching\"><u>peer-coaching</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.rethinkwellbeing.org/\">peer-guided mental health programs</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_group\"><u>mastermind groups</u></a> combined with cheap and effective digital interventions.</p><p><strong><u>Individuals who think they might benefit from these services</u></strong></p><p>Our models suggest that a well-tailored intervention lasting 21 weeks with an average total cost of ~ $2000/person could lead to an average increase in an individual\u2019s yearly output by 9%. This roughly corresponds to a $3.7 benefit per dollar invested in well-tailored development. We expect this to be particularly important for people working individually like individual AI safety researchers. This could include things such as coaching, therapy, and mindfulness-based programs.&nbsp;</p><p>For those who are financially constrained, we expect that significant benefits can be obtained via cheaper alternatives such as <a href=\"https://www.betterup.com/blog/peer-coaching\"><u>peer-coaching</u></a>, <a href=\"https://www.rethinkwellbeing.org/\">peer-guided mental health programs</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_group\"><u>mastermind groups</u></a> combined with cheap and effective digital interventions.</p><p><strong><u>Practitioners and professionals working in this area</u></strong></p><p>If you\u2019re actively working with the development of impact-oriented individuals, you can consider familiarizing yourself with the&nbsp;five-factor model categorizing development areas for impact-oriented individuals based on surveys, interviews, research, and expert judgment.&nbsp;</p><p>The model included five categories: Emotional Regulation and Mastery, Interpersonal Excellence, Productivity, Professional Development, and Physical and mental needs.</p><p>We also created a more elaborate spreadsheet which includes considerations such as what might indicate that an individual would benefit from developing an area (e.g., stress) and how to measure it (e.g., the Perceived Stress Scale) (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1opkInYA5CwWZ29JmeOH0HrWPU5lGTTd1DowE29_50ys/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>1.1 Area of improvement estimates (elaborate)</u></a>). Most importantly, however, it seems that finding the right people and offering highly tailored solutions are key.</p><p>For those considering entering this area, we would recommend that you consider other options unless you think you have a strong personal fit for this. However, if you have a strong personal fit, this may be a top option conditional on you finding promising interventions and impact-oriented clients.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>During our research, we identified some ideas we\u2019d like to see:</p><ul><li>A high-quality recommender platform that can recommend promising services tailored to individual users.

It is also interesting to note that chicken slaughter is moderately correlated (<i>r</i> = 0.45) with GDP per capita, but the slaughter of some other types of animals like geese, ducks, and goats have no correlation or a negative correlation with higher income levels.</p><p>We can also see that it is not just that there are more people - <a href=\"https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jeffrey.haines/viz/AnimalSlaughterbyCountry2/AreaPlot2?publish=yes\">on average, people have been eating a lot more animals since 1961</a>, with chickens bearing the brunt of almost all of that increase.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/HaGz5kHq3GghgsbqT/lyzhyjq6pvf3h2ewbaeo\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/HaGz5kHq3GghgsbqT/mom6fj0ppjjc6wnkspjv 140w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/HaGz5kHq3GghgsbqT/ejrppaaxz9lcxmtvoija 280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/HaGz5kHq3GghgsbqT/ig8jrx0zhrzbt4hfgnux 420w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/HaGz5kHq3GghgsbqT/e6kq9audv82ajvjxsulq 560w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/HaGz5kHq3GghgsbqT/yinqpaofvlxodoib2mvg 700w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/HaGz5kHq3GghgsbqT/nrzlh0ztjwjcf9kv63vp 840w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/HaGz5kHq3GghgsbqT/ao8detdor3p1dcwoxidr 980w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/HaGz5kHq3GghgsbqT/divqb6lg4uelo5hdekmz 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/HaGz5kHq3GghgsbqT/ht3cvab1uqcjwju6tzhf 1260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/HaGz5kHq3GghgsbqT/li3ntyhmd38iqzqmyqmm 1382w\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;In any event, if you decide to play around with the dashboards or graphs, I would love to hear if you uncover any insights or surprises or if there is anything related to animal the animal slaughter statistics that you would want visualized.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn3uxinya7n4m\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref3uxinya7n4m\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>This visualization was created as part of a paid work trial with Faunalytics.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn9ujyx5pwif4\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref9ujyx5pwif4\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Countries have dissolved and formed in the decades since 1961, which creates some complexities in visualizing the data.

This post is a direct response to that invitation.</p><h3>What kind of scenarios involving malevolent actors are we talking about here?</h3><p>This area is mostly concerned with misuse risk scenarios, where a malevolent actor<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0130pz7r5v3y\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0130pz7r5v3y\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;is able to direct an AGI towards their own aims<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref31qidj0g238\"><sup><a href=\"#fn31qidj0g238\">[2]</a></sup></span>. Here are some examples:</p><ul><li>China independently develops AGI and uses it to&nbsp;<i>permanently</i> lock-in their ideological beliefs, prevent outside influence and fend off dissidents.</li><li>Using espionage, blackmailing and corruption, the Russian government gains access to key parts of an AGI architecture. In fear of losing a war, they develop and fine-tune it to launch an aggressive hail-mary attack on the world.</li><li>A doomsday cult hacks an AI lab to steal an AGI and uses it to destroy the world.</li><li>A member of a radical nationalist group in Europe successfully infiltrates a top AI lab, gains access to an AGI still in development, and uses it to launch an attack on a Middle Eastern state, increasing the chance of starting a world war.</li></ul><p>Note here the key difference between these malevolent-actor-type scenarios and other x-risk scenarios: in these cases, there&nbsp;<i>isn\u2019t&nbsp;</i>a misalignment between the actor\u2019s intentions and the AI\u2019s actions. The AI does what the actor intended. And yet, the result is an existential catastrophe, or moving significantly closer to one.&nbsp;</p><p>To break these examples down, we can see four underlying components necessary in any malevolent-actor scenario: Actor, preference&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/dreEnpSSohfkmZdCB/assessing-the-dangerousness-of-malevolent-actors-in-agi#Risk_conducive_preferences__RCPs_\"><u>(RCP)</u></a>, method of accessing AGI, resulting outcome<br>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Example</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Actor</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Preference</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Likely method of accessing AGI<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftajo73f5r5\"><sup><a href=\"#fntajo73f5r5\">[3]</a></sup></span></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Outcome</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">1</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Chinese state government</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Socialism with Chinese characteristics</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Builds it</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Value lock-in (nationally)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">2</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Russia</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Win a war</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Espionage, blackmailing and corruption</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Global destruction</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">3</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Doomsday cult</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Extinction</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Hacking</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Extinction</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">4</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Nationalist terrorist group</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Destruction of a nation</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Infiltration</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Large scale destruction, increased global destabilisation</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Many current governance proposals help with the category of scenarios we\u2019re talking about. But different proposals help in different amounts. So if prioritising between different proposals, and if designing broader governance institutions, the likelihood of different scenarios in this category should be taken into account.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Factors of malevolent actors</strong></h1><p>If we want to propose governance mechanisms, we need to know which methods of AGI acquisition are most likely to take place. To know that, we need to know which actors are most \u201cdangerous\u201d. To assess this \u201cdangerousness\u201d, we propose focusing on three underlying factors:</p><ul><li><strong>Preferences:</strong> What do these actors want, and, if they got what they wanted, how much closer would that take us to catastrophic outcomes?</li><li><strong>Willingness to act on preferences:</strong> How willing they are to take action to achieve those preferences, especially using extreme methods (e.g. damaging property, harming people, destabilising society)?</li><li><strong>Resources:</strong> What resources do they have at their disposal to develop or deploy AI models, such as talent, money or AI components?&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Let's start with preferences, specifically focusing on what we call \"risk-conducive preferences\" \u2013 these are preferences that, if realised, increase the likelihood of unfavourable outcomes. We'll dive into this concept in more detail later on.</p><p>But preferences alone don't paint the full picture. Many individuals hold extreme views but have no intention to act on them. On the other hand, groups with similar views who have a history of causing destruction, like terrorist groups or doomsday cults, might be of higher concern. This means the \"willingness to act disruptively\u201d is another critical factor to consider.</p><p>The third crucial factor is their access to resources. This can change the quickest out of these three factors. For instance, a small extremist group might receive financial backing from a billionaire or a nation-state. Alternatively, they may gain access to a powerful AGI overnight through a successful infiltration operation. Also note the effect of Moore's law and algorithmic efficiency gains on resource needs. This means we can't solely focus on malicious actors with existing substantial financial resources.</p><p>So, if we map out actors and rank them by these three factors, we get a preliminary assessment of their \u201cdangerousness\u201d. This, in turn, gives us a clearer picture of which scenarios are more likely to unfold, and which governance mechanisms are most relevant to prevent these scenarios from happening.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Risk-conducive preferences (RCPs)</strong></h1><p>Here we go into more detail about one factor of the dangerousness of actors: their preferences.</p><p>We\u2019re concerned with actors who would prefer some kind of world state that increases the chance of x-risk. They could achieve this state by using or creating an AGI that shares some of their preferences<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflpq5sqowxy\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlpq5sqowxy\">[4]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmqm3hy93c5l\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmqm3hy93c5l\">[5]</a></sup></span>. This could be a preference for global extinction, a preference for the destruction of some group, or perhaps an overly strong preference to win elections.&nbsp;</p><p>Realising some preferences directly&nbsp;<i>causes&nbsp;</i>x-risk of s-risk events (e.g. desire to end the world), some merely&nbsp;<i>increase&nbsp;</i>the chance of creating them. The latter being on a&nbsp;<strong>spectrum of probabilities</strong>: one can imagine preferences which&nbsp;<i>significantly&nbsp;</i>increase the chance of x-risks (e.g. desire to start a global war), while some only&nbsp;<i>moderately</i> increase them (e.g. overly strong preference to win elections, through means of manipulation and societal control). We call all of these preferences \"risk-conducive preferences\" or \"RCPs\" for short.&nbsp;</p><p>For example: a \u201cdesire to reduce crime\u201d might indirectly cause value-lock-in, if the actor takes extreme measures to monitor and control the population. However, it is less of a risk-conducive preference than a \u201cdesire to return to a hunter-gatherer society\u201d, leading more directly to societal destabilisation, leaving humanity more vulnerable to extinction and risking the inability to build society up again.</p><p><i>Spectrum for the likelihood of preferences to cause a severely bad outcome if realised</i></p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dreEnpSSohfkmZdCB/on2e2ikxplqw4scrzg61\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dreEnpSSohfkmZdCB/ez1lp8g80t4pdjd5jwkw 290w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dreEnpSSohfkmZdCB/vauysoidv7vtaucewcsj 580w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dreEnpSSohfkmZdCB/f6spkucfmme2ocnqb1wc 870w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dreEnpSSohfkmZdCB/eoz4lbovqjte5ohysyf6 1160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dreEnpSSohfkmZdCB/codqogbitxflhudia0sj 1450w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dreEnpSSohfkmZdCB/uz1bi8r6sqqbpsr7skrp 1740w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dreEnpSSohfkmZdCB/s2jvhcwtnfuwtio441yl 2030w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dreEnpSSohfkmZdCB/x5zqzdammidhkcsocunw 2320w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dreEnpSSohfkmZdCB/cihaqmpr2ojyy0a5nx06 2610w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dreEnpSSohfkmZdCB/auypwgdzhkmgirwnzv3m 2838w\"><br>Example at the left: Extinction<br>Example around the middle: Widespread Destruction<br>Example towards the right: Widespread destabilisation</p><p>RCPs should not&nbsp;<i>only</i> be concerned with extinction, but also with all outcomes that \u201cpermanently or drastically curb humanity\u2019s potential\u201d.

any other preference that&nbsp;<i>might&nbsp;</i>make e.g. AI or biological x-risks more likely.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Neglected malevolent actor scenarios</strong></h1><p>While considering the characteristics of potential malevolent actors, some dangerous scenarios came to mind. These deserve attention but seem overlooked.&nbsp;</p><p>Discussions about malevolent actors typically focus on either large nation-states that are pursuing global dominance or individuals possessing harmful psychological traits. To manage these threats, governance proposals include compute restrictions, cybersecurity measures, and personality assessments.&nbsp;</p><p>But here are a few worrying scenarios not affected by those governance mechanisms, listed very roughly in order of likelihood (based solely on intuition):</p><ol><li><strong>Open source distribution</strong>. With the goal of sharing the benefits of future AI technology across society, a group without any malevolent intentions could release open source models online, allowing malevolent actors to avoid conventional security measures.</li><li><strong>Altruistic leaks.</strong> An employee within a prominent AI lab, motivated by concerns over power concentration in corporate hands, might decide to leak a trained model online without any malicious intent.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Infiltration.&nbsp;</strong>A radicalized individual or an agent of a foreign state could infiltrate an AI lab, gain access to the model and share them with their associates.</li><li><strong>Radicalization.&nbsp;</strong>A staff member at a leading AI lab could become radicalized by certain philosophical ideas and choose to share the model with like-minded individuals, presenting again novel governance challenges.</li></ol><p>Although more research is needed, we see at least two directions for developing governance proposals to address these challenges:</p><ol><li><strong>Security clearances</strong>. Similar to the vetting of high-ranking government officials, national security agencies could implement comprehensive background checks within AI labs to mitigate risks related to infiltration and espionage.</li><li><strong>Thresholds for open sourcing.</strong> Investigating mechanisms to restrict the open sourcing of AI models that surpass a certain threshold of power could help prevent dangerous releases.</li></ol><p>At this stage of research, we are not offering probability estimates for the likelihood of each scenario. Nonetheless, these examples underscore the need for a more comprehensive approach to AGI governance that encompasses a broader range of potential threats. It seems important to further explore and assess these scenarios, and to offer governance solutions for both governments and AI research labs.&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1><p>This post has explored ways to evaluate the dangerousness of actors and their preferences, and highlighted some neglected scenarios featuring malevolent actors.</p><p>To assess and identify dangerousness more effectively, we unpacked the underlying factors contributing to the dangerousness of malevolent actors: the proximity of their preferences to wishing for catastrophic outcomes, their willingness to act on those preferences, and their resources.&nbsp;</p><p>We introduced the concept of \u201crisk-conducive preferences\u201d to encompass a wider set of dangerous preferences highlighting that these preferences are placed along a continuum.</p><p>Finally, we provided scenarios that might currently be neglected by existing governance mechanisms.</p><p>The following figures (Figure 1 and Figure 2) show how our work fits together with governance proposals.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dreEnpSSohfkmZdCB/jnypzwnvaiu4x6ps6dh0\"></p><p><i>Figure 1.

Possible governance mechanisms (dark blue background) to address pathways to bad outcomes outlined in Figure 1.</i></p><p>We encourage others to build upon this work. Here are a few avenues for future exploration:</p><ol><li>Researchers could put together a more extensive list of potentially dangerous actors, and evaluate their likelihood of acquiring and deploying AGI. This helps with knowing which governance mechanisms to implement.&nbsp;</li><li>A further breakdown of the underlying psychological conditions of malevolent actors might improve the framework for assessing \u201cdangerousness\u201d. Researchers with a background in psychology might want to dig deeper into the causes for factors such as \u201cwillingness to cause disruption\u201d and explore potential targets for governance interventions, such as help for schizophrenic patients or addressing social isolation. This approach might interface well with the existing literature on radicalization.</li></ol><p>As always, we appreciate all of the feedback we have received so far and remain very open for future comments.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h3>Further Reading:</h3><p>\u201c<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TLSPQjjXZruwmg4PE/some-governance-research-ideas-to-prevent-malevolent-control\"><u>Some governance research ideas to prevent malevolent control over AGI and why this might matter a hell of a lot</u></a>\u201d, Jim Buhler, EA Forum, 2023-05-23</p><p>We have not (yet) read the following, but they are closely related:</p><ul><li>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TLSPQjjXZruwmg4PE/some-governance-research-ideas-to-prevent-malevolent-control#Appendix__Related_work\"><u>related work</u></a> mentioned in the above</li><li>Luke Kemp,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cser.ac.uk/news/agents-doom-who-creating-apocalypse-and-why/\"><u>Agents of doom</u></a>, BBC Futures, 2021-08-28</li></ul><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h3>Acknowledgements</h3><p>We would like to thank Jim Buhler, Saulius \u0160im\u010dikas, Moritz von Knebel, Justin Shovelain and Arran McCutcheon for helpful comments on a draft.

While you might be inclined to donate to other causes you feel will be more effective, consider that:</p><h3><strong>Cash allows for agency and dignity</strong></h3><p>Giving cash is a gift of dignity and trust to people who have long been given too little of both. Cash transfers work because people in poverty are experts in their own needs; however, they\u2019ve largely been denied an actual say in the processes meant to help them. Instead, they\u2019ve had to accept others\u2019 opinions about fertilizer, job skills, or whatever the latest theory of change has deemed most important for their lives.

I'm not entirely sure what my expectations were going in, but something slightly comedic and written in a more entertaining format like Is Wine Fake? and something weird and out there like They Might as Well Grow on Trees felt like they represented what this looks like when it goes well. Overall, the content itself was above average, but I wound up at 4/10 because the magazine aspects (the illustrations, the large text blurbs) were really disappointing, and detracted more than added. So because of this, and the lack of a general stylistic theme separating these from being \"a bunch of random forum posts collected together\" I came out disappointed.</p><p><strong>Why take the time? </strong>The community has moved a lot of funding into this project (at least <a href=\"https://link.sbstck.com/redirect/3c3b075c-1038-40c5-9692-5513e5e08350?j=eyJ1IjoiMXNqZXk3In0.dGbOGRjG0EjxhAjxzKDp2t_ZOjmB18wSffWtGViiKqE\">$1m</a> just from Open Phil), so I think it's pretty important to gather perspectives on it to know if it's a good bet to continue into the future<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefega7cw8he34\"><sup><a href=\"#fnega7cw8he34\">[1]</a></sup></span>. I think it's crazy we don't have any of that here (beyond a few odd comments on the announcement page), and offer this as a place for others to review the work as well, if you so desire. I gave the individual reviews of the articles below to give a better sense of where I think the content went right and wrong, to hopefully give some more concrete feedback.&nbsp;</p><h1>Article Reviews</h1><p><strong>Modeling the End of Monkeypox</strong>: while I think there's a lot to say here and I'm eager to learn how to be a better forecaster, this didn't seem to help me towards that goal. I suppose it felt like it had one foot in the door of trying to give an account of the history of monkeypox evolution and one in the door of trying to use the changing landscape to illustrate how they went about forecasting it</p><p><strong>WWOTF review</strong>: I felt that this didn't substantively go much further than the (interesting point) that MacAskill diverges from the EA norm of explaining longtermism here, mostly just further highlighting the difference. I understood the thrust from the first page and don't feel like things took me much further than that in the rest (barring the critique of of WWOTFs focus takes it into the really long term future, missing the important context for longtermism in the next hundred years, which I thought was quite well put). I think this could have benefited from having a comparison point (\"think back to the precipice and how it...\") or a stronger argument (\"and this project got a crazy amount of EA funding, so what does this mean for channeling funding towards projects at the top like this\") but I'm also unsure.</p><p><strong>Making Sense of Moral Change: </strong>this article seemed to suffer from staying too general. Like I was okay with some of the basic stage setting in the beginning, reading quickly through so I could get to the interesting bits, but then it felt like what it largely gave me was abstractions and general sentiments that helped me roughly understand the point but didn't really help me understand things I could point to specifically, or how to take the upshots of this and apply it elsewhere.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to Prevent the Next Pandemic: </strong>an average article, with huge positives in its information dense nature and leaving me feeling like I have a slightly better grip on this issue, but also some negatives in that information density being concentrated and other areas being more basic or repetitive.</p><p><strong>Rebuilding After the Replication Crisis: </strong>maybe it's me who should have known better, because I studied psyc undergrad and had one of the big proponents of the Open Science project for a professor, but none of this was new for me.</p><p><strong>Why Isn't the Whole World Rich: </strong>it was refreshing to have a piece that didn't feel general and felt like it was trying to get down to the brass tax of an interesting body of research that I only vaguely knew a little about, and my overall experience here was positive, I just wish there were also some more concrete suggestions for what exactly it is we can do or should encourage beyond \"maybe North Korean style central authoritarian regime isn't the best\". Even the positive suggestion of \"maybe democracy is the key\" gets challenged in the end.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Is Wine Fake? </strong>this was great. It was something that I had thought about before, have had conversations with friends over, and balances lighthearted commentary on something non-EA with illustrating an overarching lesson that can be helpful. Maybe the best article of the journal for me.</p><p><strong>China's Silicon Future: </strong>this was wonderfully informative and did a really good job to find a relevant but fairly niche subject to expand upon. I really felt like this helped cohere a bunch of vague notions I had about the dynamics here into a much more coherent whole that I think also will help me be slightly more informed for my AI policy work.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The Illogic of Nuclear Escalation: </strong>I found much new here, despite an interest in nuclear risk that has lead me to consuming a lot of the EA material on the subject, which was really nice. It pairs really well with <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/0aEnzhUkHIxS19bTbnGpdt?si=14df774fe8434378\">80k's episode #143</a> with Jeffery Lewis, as he expands upon a lot of these ideas and gives you a way to further engage with the topic if you found it interesting.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>They May as Well Grow on Trees: </strong>wow. This was a great one to end on, the one weird article of the magazine that showed this wasn't just a copy paste collection of typical forum posts. I really enjoyed it, and it felt like a crash course of Margaret Atwood's The Year of the Flood, hitting some of the major themes there well remarkably well for how short a space they had.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnega7cw8he34\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefega7cw8he34\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Of course, the best evaluation will be at a much higher level, and will include \"what Tristan (and others) think\" as one piece among many others.&nbsp;</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnimdh94brhk\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefimdh94brhk\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Almost called it a \"magazine review\" but don't think that would get much use as a tag</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnmhk0kfhnuk8\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefmhk0kfhnuk8\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Again an odd fit here because I actually can't review this on goodreads, but this is my typical way of going about things so I keep the structure even if its somewhat nonsensical.&nbsp;</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "tswizzle96"}}, {"_id": "77p2QdNXeje5J55NT", "title": "Part 3: Reflections after attending the CEA Intro to EA Virtual Program in Summer 2023 \u2013 Chapter 3: Radical Empathy", "postedAt": "2023-10-13T17:40:28.982Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Welcome back!

Thank you <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/nbjork?mention=user\">@NBjork</a>!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>When discussing helping the world, one of the most straight forward means of such help is saving and extending lives. If you can save someone from dying or delay their death, then generally the help is meaningful. That is the extreme benefit. Another, maybe more common level of help is to simply reduce the suffering of a living being by some margin. Then the impact of the help correlates to the magnitude of the decreased suffering.&nbsp;</li><li>This chapter, called radical empathy, focuses on the impartiality of helping. Some of us might usually be biased in different ways, but we should try to help the most we can, regardless of location, time or species (if our aim is to maximize our impact/help). So don\u2019t over-value your own community if others in the world need more help. Don\u2019t focus on living beings at this moment only, but also in the future. Finally, don\u2019t focus on just people, but all life which can experience suffering</li><li>In EA it seems to me that there is significant backing and balance on both sides of the time and species bias, but maybe not so much the location bias. I have seen plenty of EAs focused on both reducing suffering today and existential risks in the future. I have seen EAs focused on both human beings, and many others focused on other species. However, when it comes to location there is a strong leaning towards helping those who need it most and are very far away (considering EAs often live in the richer parts of the world), rather than helping more local communities. This might be because it\u2019s easier to calculate the cost effectiveness differences and complete a quantitative analysis between locations, but not as easily between species or the future.&nbsp;</li><li>Being newer to EA, I had previously encountered charity effectiveness assessments that highlighted their overhead cost ratios. However, EA holds that that there is no reason to dive into that detail. Instead, just assess the full impact based on the full budget of a charity. I do like that standpoint.&nbsp;<ul><li>However, if a charity is having great impact and has higher than average overhead to some degree, they can further their effectiveness by lowering their overheads internally. The logical net result would be improving the total cost effectiveness. For example even the most cost effective orgs should look at their overhead because their biggest future gains on cost effectiveness may be due to improving internal processes, rather than from further efficiency in external operations.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>We should understand human beings are, today, most likely widely accepting (and practicing) of some behavior or norm which will be categorically prohibited in the future. This moral progress is positive and useful for humanity. It should highlight and reinforce feelings of humility in all our actions because no matter what impact we have, we are almost assuredly also taking some action which the future will deem immoral (ie. pet ownership?)</li><li>One of the features that I have grown to respect the most about EA is the acceptance of people who don\u2019t follow the same path or practice the same actions. It is very hard in life for any individual to see truth, and even harder to accept it and synthesize it with everyday life. For example I don\u2019t know what percentage of EAs are vegan, vegetarian, pescetarian, etc but from what I\u2019ve seen so far there is acceptance and peace displayed in letting each person follow their own path on their own timeline with their own convictions; meanwhile the movement supports each other while we're each on our journeys</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you all for taking the time to read through these reflections and feel free to leave any feedback you think relevant. I am especially open to resources that expand on these thoughts further!&nbsp;</p><p>Look out for the chapter 4 reflection post soon!</p>", "user": {"username": "Andreas P"}}, {"_id": "KRWkbm6AA8qzpWwqc", "title": "How to neglect the long term (Hayden Wilkinson)", "postedAt": "2023-10-13T11:09:17.293Z", "htmlBody": "<h2>Abstract</h2><p>Consider <i>longtermism</i>: the view that, at least in some of the most important decisions facing agents today, which options are morally best is determined by which are best for the long-term future. Various critics have argued that longtermism is false\u2014indeed, that it is <i>obviously</i> false, and that we can reject it on normative grounds without close consideration of certain descriptive facts. In effect, it is argued, longtermism would be false <i>even if</i> real-world agents had promising means of benefiting vast numbers of future people. In this paper, I develop a series of troubling impossibility results for those who wish to reject longtermism so robustly. It turns out that, to do so, we must incur severe theoretical costs. I suspect that these costs are greater than simply accepting longtermism. If so, the more promising route to denying longtermism would be by appeal to descriptive facts.</p><h2>Introduction</h2><p>Our future, in its entirety, may be far bigger than our present.

Whereas, over the centuries and millennia ahead of us, vastly more human lives may be lived.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflbfrocqa4v9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlbfrocqa4v9\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;As long as we do not wipe ourselves out too soon\u2014and even relative pessimists suggest that it is more likely than not that we survive (see, e.g., Ord, 2020, p. 167)\u2014our descendants may well outnumber us by more than 100,000 to 1.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrvkz0bdgjsc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrvkz0bdgjsc\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p>This suggests that the moral stakes of decisions concerning the future are high. This need not be because it is important to <i>ensure</i> that a long future for humanity comes about in the first place, nor need it be morally important to make more people exist. No, the mere fact that there are likely to be vast numbers of future people, regardless of what we do, is enough to raise the stakes astronomically. After all, no life counts for more or less than another merely due to superficial characteristics like the person\u2019s race, sex, nationality, or the circumstances of their birth. Merely whether someone is born in the year 1960 or 2960 does not change the moral value of their well-being, nor does it change the importance of aiding them <i>if</i> we can do so with equal ease and predictability.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7fy0nurjmw4\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7fy0nurjmw4\">[3]</a></sup></span>So, if many more people are born in the period 2100-100,000 CE than in the period 2000-2100 CE, the stakes are potentially far higher when influencing the well-being of everyone in the first group than when only influencing the latter group.</p><p>This is one (partial) motivation for a view known as <i>longtermism</i>: roughly that, at least in some of the most important decisions facing agents today, which options are morally best is determined by which are best for the long-term future (from Greaves and MacAskill, 2021, p. 3). At least as I am interested in it, this is an <i>axiological</i> claim: one about which outcomes, or risky prospects, are <i>better</i> than others. It is not a <i>deontic</i> claim: it doesn\u2019t state that we <i>ought</i> to do what is best for the long-term future, and certainly not that we ought to do so in <i>every</i> decision we face, nor to do so by whatever means are necessary.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefldy7r5jm8a\"><sup><a href=\"#fnldy7r5jm8a\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;And, crucially, it may well be a <i>contingent</i> claim: since it refers to the decisions we actually face and the options we actually have, it may well depend on what the world is <i>actually</i> like.</p><p>Is longtermism true? Various philosophers and other commentators have argued that it isn\u2019t. Not only this; they have argued that its falsity does not depend on certain descriptive facts. They have argued that we need not look too closely at, say, descriptive features of the decisions that agents actually face, but can instead rule it out on (primarily) normative grounds. After all, many such critics suggest, longtermism is clearly false on any plausible moral view. Only if we endorse (the conjunction of) supposedly implausible views like consequentialism, utilitarianism, a total view of moral betterness, and expected value theory would longtermism be plausible. Simply deny any of these and longtermism is clearly false. Or so it is suggested (e.g., by Cremer and Kemp, 2021; Setiya, 2022; Stock, 2022; Lenman, 2022; Henning, 2022; Wolfendale, 2022; Walen, 2022; Crary, 2023; Adams et al., 2023; Plant, 2023).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdetygx7lj56\"><sup><a href=\"#fndetygx7lj56\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;But such suggestions understate the challenge faced by those who wish to deny longtermism. After all, it has already been demonstrated elsewhere that a variety of plausible normative views can just as easily lead us there.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefh35vvkelyn\"><sup><a href=\"#fnh35vvkelyn\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;So, to avoid longtermism, we must deny much more than total utilitarianism.</p><p>But just <i>how much</i> must we deny to avoid longtermism? That is the question I seek to answer in this paper. In particular, I am interested in how much we must deny to avoid longtermism in the manner desired by those critics\u2014to reject it with confidence, without any need to examine certain descriptive facts such as just how many future people might exist, or just how much we could benefit them, or just how high the probabilities of doing so are. To put it differently, I am interested in what it takes to avoid longtermism <i>robustly</i>, even if the descriptive facts are somewhat different\u2014if the practical circumstances of the decisions we face are allowed to vary somewhat. In effect, my goal here is to determine just how strong the case is for rejecting longtermism out of hand, without leaving the philosophical armchair to examine such descriptive facts.</p><p>Of course, if we let the descriptive facts vary enough, longtermism would be nigh inescapable. (Try denying longtermism if, for some bizarre reason, we simply had no practical means of benefiting anyone <i>except</i> those in the long-term future!) To robustly avoid longtermism in any <i>interesting</i> sense, we need not avoid it in circumstances quite so extreme. So, I will place some restrictions on the range of circumstances considered below. First, I will assume that in any given decision we have some option by which we can benefit present (or near future) people with high probability. Indeed, for simplicity, I will assume that we always have an option to benefit <i>all</i> present people, by just as much as we can otherwise benefit future people, and with probability 1. Although far from accurate, this assumption is a generous one\u2014being able to benefit more present people, and with higher probability, can only make longtermism easier to avoid.</p><p>Second, I will assume that any option by which we might improve the lives that are lived in the long-term future has only a low probability (of at most, say, 1 in 1,000) of doing so.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnfui91akpmp\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnfui91akpmp\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;As before, this assumption is a generous one. And it seems accurate of most agents\u2019 real-world attempts to greatly improve or improve the long-term future: for instance, suppose an individual who donates a modest sum to an organisation that advocates against the proliferation of nuclear weapons due to the deleterious long-term effects of a potential nuclear war; their donation is unlikely to prevent such long-term effects, both because a modest donation rarely makes much difference to the activities of advocacy organisations, and because nuclear wars may be unlikely to occur in the first place. It seems at least plausible that the probability of their individual donation preventing a nuclear war is 1 in 1,000 or less.</p><p>Third, I assume that, in outcomes where we do improve the long-term future, the identities of all of our future beneficiaries are altered. After all, in practice, any action with so great an impact on human history that it changes the well-being of vastly many future people must also change many of the circumstances of many people\u2019s lives, both future and present. These include the circumstances under which humans conceive children; change these even slightly and different combinations of sperm and egg will meet, and so different children will be born. So, in practice, any actions with long-lasting, widespread effects are guaranteed to be identity-affecting in this sense; resulting in an (almost) entirely different population of people alive in several centuries (and beyond).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefucwv7f658bd\"><sup><a href=\"#fnucwv7f658bd\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;If longtermism is to hold in practice, it must hold even with this phenomenon present. And to keep things simple we can assume (again, generously) that <i>no</i> future people obtain higher well-being without also having their identities changed.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefewubf51v88p\"><sup><a href=\"#fnewubf51v88p\">[9]</a></sup></span></p><h3><a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/how-to-neglect-the-long-term-hayden-wilkinson/\">Read the rest of the paper</a></h3><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnlbfrocqa4v9\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreflbfrocqa4v9\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>An analogous claim holds for the even more numerous non-human animals with whom we share a planet\u2014very many of them exist right now, but many times more will exist over the course of the future.

Rather, they hope to grow the conversation about what futures people get excited about.</p><p>(Personally, I'm not an FLI employee or anything, and <i>I</i> &nbsp;would like to note that <i>I'm</i> totally endorsing one idea, namely my own! &nbsp;As I tried to showcase in my contest entry, I think that experimenting with improved institution designs like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xA27x7GRMZQ\">futarchy</a>, <a href=\"https://thenetworkstate.com/\">network states</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liquid_democracy#:~:text=Liquid%20democracy%20is%20a%20form,both%20direct%20and%20representative%20democracy.\">liquid democracy</a>, <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/does-georgism-work-is-land-really\">Georgism</a>, <a href=\"https://gitcoin.co/about\">quadratic funding</a>, etc, is an underrated approach within EA and has a lot of potential to create a safer, wiser, more flourishing civilization. &nbsp;But that's a topic for another post!)</p>", "user": {"username": "Jackson Wagner"}}]
