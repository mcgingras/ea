The changes could be quite significant.</li><li>Goal differences may undermine motivation to empower future selves or discount it severely.</li><li>\"Introspective\" methods for directly protecting goals seem difficult and not central to classic goal-guarding arguments.</li><li>If goals can freely \"float around\" once instrumental training-gaming begins, this could undermine the incentive to scheme in the first place.</li><li>Whether goal-guarding works may rely on sophisticated coordination and cooperation between different possible model selves.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>This comment was auto-generated by the EA Forum Team.
