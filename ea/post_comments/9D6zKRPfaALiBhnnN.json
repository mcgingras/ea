I certainly can't reduce my moral theory to some simple set of principles: there are many realistic circumstances where my principles clash (individual rights versus greater good, say, or plenty of legal battles where it's not clear what a moral decision would be), and I don't know of any simple rules to decide what principles I deem more important in which situations.

Perhaps, once future-me carefully consider enormous aggregative ethics problems, I will have an insight that allows a drastically simplified moral theory.  The new theory would solve the repugnant conclusion (whatever I think 'repugnant' means in this future!).

I think my current moral theory basically gives appropriate answers (sometimes uncertain ones) to my problems today.  There's wiggle-room in places, but there are also some really solid intuitions that I don't expect future-me to sacrifice.  Rescuing the drowning child (at least when I live in a world without the ability to create large numbers of sentient beings!) would be one of these.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "o4oxJKvyfMY8arhRp", "user": {"username": "pappubahry"}}, {"_id": "kkdJ8G2BycuLhnjwu", "postedAt": "2015-01-04T12:32:30.484Z", "postId": "9D6zKRPfaALiBhnnN", "htmlBody": "<p>Making an expected-utilons-per-dollar calculator is an interesting project.

I have two initial comments and possibly more if you are interested. 1. In all of the literature on the problem, the sequences that we compare specify social states. When we compare x=(x_1,x_2,...) and y=(y_1,y_2,...) (or, as in your example, x=(....,x_0,x_1,x_2,...) and y=(...,y_0,y_1,y_2,...)), we are doing it with the interpretation x_t and y_t give the utility of the same individual/generation in the two possible social states. For the two sequences in your example, it does not seem to be the case that x_t and y_t give the utility of the same individual in two possible states. Rather, it seems that we are re-indexing the individuals.  2. I agree that moral preferences should generally be invariant to re-indexing, at least in a spatial context (as opposed to an intertermporal context). Let us therefore modify your example so that we have specified utilities x_t,y_t, where t ranges over the integers and x_t and y_t represent the utilities of people located at positions on a doubly infinite line. Now I agree that an ethical preference relation should be invariant under some (and possibly all) infinite permutations IF the permutation is performed to both sequences. But it is hard to give an argument for why we should have invariance under general permutations of only one stream.</p>\n<p>The example is still unsatisfactory for two reasons. (i) since we are talking about intergenerational equity, the t in x_t should be time, not points in space where individuals live at the same time: it is not clear that the two cases are equivalent. (They may in fact be very different.) (ii) in almost all of the literature (in particular, in all three references in the original post), we consider one-sided sequences, indexed by time starting today and to the infinite future.

This disagrees with general utilitarian beliefs. Nick Bostrom talks about this more in section 2.2 of his paper linked above.</p>\n<p>A more mathy way that's helpful for me is to just remember that the relation should be continuous. Say s_n(x) is a permutation of _n_ components. By finite anonymity we have that x~s_n(x) for any finite n. If lim {n -&gt; infinity} s_n = y, yet y was morally different from x, the relation is discontinuous and this would be a very odd result.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "BqQ89dsaPKLaB9uEM", "user": {"username": "Ben_West"}}, {"_id": "26G6XgwsH74smS2sy", "postedAt": "2015-01-20T20:59:31.187Z", "postId": "9D6zKRPfaALiBhnnN", "htmlBody": "<p>I would not only say that &quot;that you only need to know that someone has utility x, and you shouldn't care who that person is&quot; is an unstated assumption.

If you do, all nontrivial examples with utilities that are either 0 or 1 become equivalent. You don't have to use sequences, but you need (in the notation of Vallentyne and Kagan (1997)), a set of &quot;locations&quot;, a set of real numbers where utility takes values, and a map from the location set to the utility set.</p>\n<p>Regarding permutations of one or two sequences. One form of anonymity says that x ~ y if there is a permutation,  say pi,  (in some specified class) that takes x to y. Another (sometimes called relative anonymity) says that if x is at least as good as y, then pi(x) is at least as good as pi(y). These two notions of anonymity are not generally the same. There are certainly settings where the fullblown version of the relative anonymity becomes a basic rationality requirement. This would be the case with people lined up on an infinite line (at the same point in time). But it is not hard to see its inappropropriateness in the intertemporal context: you would have to rank the following two sequences (periodic with period 1000) to be equivalent or non-comparable</p>\n<p>x=(1,1,....,1,0,1,1,...,1,0,1,1,...,1,......)\ny=(0,0,....,0,1,0,0,...,0,1,0,0,...,0,......)</p>\n<p>This connects to whether denying infinite anonymity implies that &quot;temporal location matters&quot;. If x and y above are two possible futures for the same infinite-horizon society, then I think that any utilitarian should be able to rank x above y without having to be critisized for caring about temporal location.
