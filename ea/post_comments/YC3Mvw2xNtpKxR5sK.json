I think taking into account the historical and geographical diversity of moral projects might make your analysis more powerful as well, as it might show that many cultures in the past have undertaken projects of moral progress but perhaps not succeeded and learning from their mistakes might make for more robust outcomes.

It's a great book! It might feel a bit long if you're not a philosopher, but it's definitely a standout solid reading with many insights on this topic.</p><p>On The Blank Slate and Moral Uncertainty, sure, let me add the following to my reviews in order to add to that:&nbsp;</p><p>Those two books I think are really good with regards to their subject matter. They're both general overviews of their respective fields. Moral Uncertainty is much more technical, but basically the required reading if you're getting into that topic for the first time. So it's 5/5 stars if you're interested in the topic, probably the best starting point.</p><p>The Blank Slate is more replaceable with any other introduction to cognitive science. It presents stuff like the view of the mind as a computer, with debates like the Language of Thought, connectionism, and human nature. Pinker is more accessible than \"textbooks\" like Tim Crane's \"The Mechanical Mind\", which are more rigorous but technical and harder to read.</p><p>Pinker also presents his opinionated side of things, siding with the evolutionary psychologists John Tooby and Leda Cosmides on analyzing humans as biological animals which inherit a lot of instincts. So he wants to argue that we are instinctually hard-wired towards certain behavior, which explains stuff like our capacity for language.&nbsp;</p><p>At some points he rambles against \"leftists\" in academia which want to deny instinctual human nature. He wants to detach ethics and human rights from any particular conception of human nature.</p><p>I take a bit of a middle position between Pinker and the \"leftist that wants to deny human nature\". I think the evolutionary psychology standpoint is definitely worth taking into consideration, but it might be more straightforward to apply with regards to stuff like language learning, which happens in an individual mind, than to politics and societies, which is less straightforward since there are new phenomena that happens when you're dealing with interactions of large groups of people. (I think more recently Pinker would even agree with that, since in his later books like Better Angels and Enlightenment Now, Pinker is a defender of enlightenment values to overcome our \"pre-wired\" tribalism.) I'd say it's like a 4/5 stars reading.</p><p>I'll also edit the post to reflect this.</p>", "parentCommentId": "uiuAmEsQbQonEgGse", "user": {"username": "rafaruizdelira"}}, {"_id": "hPCGJx4B9D7uyXazj", "postedAt": "2023-12-21T20:18:55.309Z", "postId": "YC3Mvw2xNtpKxR5sK", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Ulrik! I'm definitely aware of this issue, and it's a very ugly side of this debate, which is why some people might have moved away from the topic in the past.</p><p>The dangers of using moral progress to justify colonialism and imperialism will be one key point in my next post, and it's also a brief section in the first chapter of my thesis. It's definitely worth cautioning against imposing progress to other cultures. And political intervention is much more complicated than \"my culture is more progressed, so we should enforce it upon the rest\". It deals with difficult issues of epistemic biases, lack of political legitimacy, and political paternalism. Aside from being a convenient excuse for the powerful to come to other countries and exploit others. It's probably not enough, but at least the explicit warning and section is there.</p><p>I try not to adhere or rely on particularly \"western\" values in my view of progress. But there's controversy as whether values such as moral impartiality and individual human rights are western. Amartya Sen for example wants to claim that they aren't, and he finds examples of such values in nonwestern contexts (in Development as Freedom Chapter 10). But I am not fully convinced either way.

I guess I'm an advocate for <i>differential</i> <i>progress</i>, like Ord. That is, prioritizing safety advancements relative to technical advancements. Not stopping work on AI capabilities, but right now shifting the current balance from capabilities work to safety work. And then in some years/decades once we have figured out alignment, shift the focus on capabilities again.</p><p>My very rough take on things is that as long as we manage to develop advanced LLMs (e.g. GPT5, 6, 7... and Copilots) slowly and carefully before dangerous AGI, we should use those LLMs to help us with technical alignment work. I think technical alignment work is the current bottleneck of the whole situation.
