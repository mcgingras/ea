I love the idea of a trans-fat ban and I agree it's plausible for rich countries at least given some governments already have limits. It's worth noting there is already sme public support for moving away from trans-fats. Many products now list \"no trans fats\" on their label which indicates people care enough that companies are incentivised to advertise that. Many people though still don't know how bad trans-fats are as well. Trans fats are one of the very few dietary things to have pretty solid evidence for the harm they cause</p><p>As a small note (which might be irrelevant as it doesn't affect your calculations), the poorest of the poor (usually subsistence farmers) around the world effectively don't consume trans-fat, so its not going to help them.</p><p>As a lolz note, for somene still getting used to EA things, this kind of thing cracks me up too.

Intuitively, factory-farmed animals have more intense experiences (relative to their moral weight / peak welfare capacity), so I think accounting for intensity would make saving lives even more negative than my BOTEC suggested. Moreover, in general, I would claim non-experiential goods tend to be correlated with experiential ones, so I do not think accounting for them would favour saving human lives (also, factory-farmed animals have little liberty and achievement, and die more often). In any case, &nbsp;all goods are experiential in the sense words like \"life per se, or liberty, or achievement, or love etc\" refer to subsets of experiences.</p><blockquote><p>If you factor all this in, (probably) saving lives isn't net negative - but it's very subjective, since obviously we can't really measure the qualitative experience of animals and have to extrapolate/guess.</p></blockquote><p>Have you considered the effects on wild (terresthrial and marine) arthropods and nematodes (due to deforestation, fishing, and global warming)? Accounting for these, I think the sign of the expected value will be quite uncertain... We may conclude that our best guess for it is negative/positive, but that would not offer a strong basis for action. If there is lots of uncertainty, I think it makes more sense to say that we do not know, and carry out more research to increase the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/credal-resilience\">resilience</a> of our estimates.</p>", "parentCommentId": "pSRPwiAHXYip7uQgb", "user": {"username": "vascoamaralgrilo"}}]
