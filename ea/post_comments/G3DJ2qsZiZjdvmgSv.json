My assessment here is based partly on my understanding of the work of CE policy charities (LEEP/PEN/Good Policies), researching and planning out a potential tobacco taxation charity in the recent CE incubation programme (went with CEARCH in the end), and also my past work in government/policy consulting. I have moderate confidence in the view that conditional on there being interest from policymakers, you can work your way up to cabinet ministers within a year in a LMIC and get a yes/no answer by then. I also have high confidence in the view that if the government is not interested, you get the feedback from lower level civil servants long before that, allowing you to pivot accordingly. All this is premised on a high willingness to ignore sunk costs and pivot quickly, and excludes implementation time (folding that into the next year of operations, as you juggle both advising the persuaded government and lobbying the next country)<br><br>I'll recalibrate this as I get more expert advice (and also update on the more recent work of CE policy charities, including Mathias Bonde's aid policy organization).</p>", "parentCommentId": "8JBFyYybTpvg38nKv", "user": {"username": "Joel Tan"}}, {"_id": "K2TubkxfWDn8K6NA7", "postedAt": "2022-11-22T02:02:36.717Z", "postId": "G3DJ2qsZiZjdvmgSv", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Akhil! Hope you're enjoying your new role!<br><br>(1) I didn't look at community salt substitution at any real depth. My quick prioritization on tractable solutions (definitely the weakest part of the 5-day shallow research process) was that policy intervention via a tax would be more effective than direct delivery (including providing communities with free salt substitutes).

Will be looking to re-examine the costing, by talking to experts and orgs (especially WASSH) in the area, especially since the topline cost-effectiveness number is so sensitive to this.

In particular, I think we need to be careful about assuming linear effects on BP and burden of disease based on a very small change in daily sodium intake. You've thought deeply about this problem, so would be keen to hear your thoughts on what I've sketched out below.</p><p>You estimated that a tax would reduce sodium consumption by 67 mg per day; a <a href=\"https://www.bmj.com/content/346/bmj.f1325\">meta-analyses suggests</a> that reducing dietary salt by a mean of 4.4 g per day leads to a mean reduction of systolic BP of 4.18 mm Hg. There was a bigger drop (5.39 mm Hg) in hypertensive people. [Note: my best guess is that your estimate of sodium reduction is for molecular sodium whereas these numbers are for salt - NaCl - &nbsp;4.4 g of NaCl would be about 1.7 g of Na.] Based on this, I would say it's very generous to assume any more than 0.5 mm Hg average reduction in systolic BP from 67 mg less sodium per day. 0.5 mm Hg is well within measurement error. This may be a case where a very small effect multiplied by a huge number of people still has a huge effect, but I think more evidence would be helpful. In particular, can we find evidence that:</p><ul><li>the relationship between sodium intake and BP is linear and holds true for <i>milligram</i> quantities of change?

This is really interesting. I only skimmed, but my basic reaction is that I agree that hypertension is an important problem, but am skeptical about salt taxes as a solution. Here are a few reasons why:<br><br>1) &nbsp;I suspect salt taxes are less effective at reducing consumption of the offending agent than other kinds of sin taxes (e.g., sugar, tobacco) for two reasons. First, per the linked article, the taxes have historically been applied to salty foods, like chips, instant noodles, and salted nuts. But I suspect a large percentage of the salt people consume comes from the food they cook. Second, it is easier to replace the salt that is taken out of salty foods. You wouldn't buy a sugar-free soda and add sugar to it, but you might well add salt to nuts, instant noodles, and so on. (My parents would buy unsalted microwave popcorn when I was a kid, and I developed workarounds...)&nbsp;<br><br>2) This is very speculative, but I worry that salt taxes\u2014which, as you note, will be unpopular\u2014could lead to broader backlash against sin taxes, in much the same way that more draconian masking rules have, perhaps, incited broader backlash against masking. It would be very bad if pushing for salt taxes led to reduced public support for tobacco taxes.<br><br>3) Like other commenters, I'm a bit skeptical of the extent to which reducing salt consumption reduces blood pressure. Just looking quickly at this Cochrane review, the drop in systolic blood pressure (SBP) for hypertensive people was 5mm Hg (and only 2mm Hg for normotensive people) with reduced salt consumption. These drops may be statistically significant, but I'm not bowled over by their clinical significance. If a patient with a BP of 150/90 reduced their SBP to 145 by limiting salt consumption, you'd put them on an antihypertensive.&nbsp;<br><br>4) I'm perhaps most confused by how quickly antihypertensives are dismissed as an option\u2014<br>\"medications, will by their nature be more expensive as an intervention than policy change.\" My understanding is that the substantial reductions in cardiovascular mortality seen in the Western world are <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199904223401601 \">largely attributable</a> to the use of antihypertensives and statins. Even in the US, you can get a 30-day supply of lisinopril for $3.75, and you'd expect this to reduce the above patient's SBP by <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2442549/#:~:text=When%20lisinopril%20is%20given%20once,hyperglycemia%2C%20hyperuricemia%2C%20or%20hypercholesterolemia\">17-23 mm Hg</a>\u2014a 3-4x greater reduction than you'd see with reduced salt consumption. &nbsp;<br><br>5) Of course, health care costs much more than just the cost of medications. But if you want a policy solution, I'm inclined to think that a better intervention would involve widespread population BP screening and incentivizing providers to prescribe (and patients to take) antihypertensives. <a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2208275\">Polypills</a>\u2014which include, e.g., antihypertensives, aspirin, and statins\u2014also look really promising and do more than just reduce hypertension, although pharmaceutical companies have little incentive to make these. So I'd also be eager to see policy solutions aimed at making polypills more widely available.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": null}, {"_id": "A6cqzzeN3QvzdGyPt", "postedAt": "2022-11-23T05:13:18.533Z", "postId": "G3DJ2qsZiZjdvmgSv", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for the feedback!<br><br>(1) My understanding is that literal packs/shakers of salt sold in supermarkets would not be exempt from the sodium tax. But that raises more dramatic political problems (e.g. at a $0.3 per mg tax, that increases a 500g packet of salt by 100x), and I presume the per mg tax on literal raw salt would have to be far lower. In general, I do agree that substitution with home food is a worry, though there will also be frictions (i.e. not perfect substitutes because of the social element, time needed to cook, etc).<br><br>(2) I'm not sure if this is a significant concern - it depends on your frame of reference, and one could easily argue the opposite (e.g. more aggressive sin taxes normalizes them/shifts the overton window, so even if the extreme version gets rejected, people see the more conventional ones like on tobacco and alcohol as reasonable by comparison). In general, I'm not sure if we have strong reason to believe one way or another.</p><p>(3) I think I'm fairly deferential to the scientific consensus in this area, which seems strong - it's something I'll definitely look more closely into via expert intervews.<br><br>(4) &amp; (5) Generally, direct delivery (whether of medication or general checkups/treatments) is a lot more expensive due to (a) actually requiring ongoing resources, and (b) counterfactual costliness, for an EA charity.
