They have lower costs than retreats since housing is optional.</li><li>Workshops should involve exercises and interaction. Topics can range widely. Benefits apply even if the topic isn't valuable for all.</li><li>Compared to socials and retreats, workshops are medium effort and cost. But they may provide comparable impact to retreats for participants.</li><li>Larger workshops enable out-of-town participants and expert speakers. More time allows deeper engagement. Weekends enable full energy.</li><li>Workshops only require a venue, facilitator, possibly funding, food/drinks, participants, and communication. Accommodation is optional.</li><li>Even free workshops with volunteer facilitators in someone's home are viable starting points. But all groups should consider workshops.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>This comment was auto-generated by the EA Forum Team.
