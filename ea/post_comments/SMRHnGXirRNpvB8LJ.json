All objections were fairly straightforward to address except for one which - in addressing it - seemed to upend how many participants viewed EA, given what image they thus far had of EA. That objection is: <strong>Effective Altruism is not that effective.</strong></p>\n<p>There is a lot to be said for this objection and I highly highly recommend anyone who calls themselves an EA to read up on it <a href=\"http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/effective-altruism-not-no-brainer/\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://philosophicaldisquisitions.blogspot.ca/2016/05/is-effective-altruism-actually-effective.html\">here</a>. None of <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/faqs-criticism-objections/#objections-to-effective-altruism\">the other objections</a> to EA seem to me to have nearly as much moral urgency as this one. If we call this thing we do EA and it is not E I see a moral problem. If you donate to deworming charities and have never heard of wormwars I also recommend taking a look at <a href=\"https://storify.com/viewfromthecave/tracking-the-wormwars\">this</a> which is an attempt to track the entire debacle of &quot;deworming-isn't-that-effective&quot; controversy in good faith.</p>\n<p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> I donate to SCI and rank it near the top of my priorities, just below AMF currently. I even donate to less certain charities like <a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/\">ACE's recommendations</a>. So I certainly don't mean to dissuade anyone from donating in this comment. Reasoning under uncertainty is a thing and you can see <a href=\"https://danwahl.github.io/stochastic-altruism-2016\">these</a> <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/193/how_do_ea_orgs_account_for_uncertainty_in_their/\">two</a> recent posts if you desire insight into how an EA might try to go about it effectively.</p>\n<p>The take home of this though is the same as the three main points raised by OP. If it had been made clear to us from the get-go what mechanisms are at play that determine how much impact an individual has with their donation to an EA recommended charity, then this <strong>EA is not E</strong> objection would have been as innocuous as <a href=\"https://www.effectivealtruism.org/faqs-criticism-objections/#objections-to-effective-altruism\">the rest</a>. Instead, after addressing this concern and setting straight how things actually work (I still don't completely understand it, it's complicated) participants felt their initial exposure to EA (such as through the guide dog example and other over-simplified EA infographics that strongly imply it's as simple and obvious as: &quot;donation = lives saved&quot;) contained false advertising. The words <em>slight disillusionment</em> comes to mind, given these were all dedicated EAs going into the workshop.</p>\n<p>So yes, I bow down to the almighty points bestowed by OP:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>many of us were overstating the point that money goes further in poor countries</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>many of us don\u2019t do enough fact checking, especially before making public claims</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>many of us should communicate uncertainty better</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Btw, <em>Scope insensitive</em> link does not seem to work I'm afraid (Update: Thanx for fixing!)</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Cornelius"}}, {"_id": "Rja5xGxo3Y2r8CW3b", "postedAt": "2017-05-11T07:37:31.670Z", "postId": "SMRHnGXirRNpvB8LJ", "htmlBody": "<p>This feels like nitpicking that gives the impression of undermining Singer's original claim when in reality the figures support them.  I have no reason to believe Singer was claiming that of all possible charitable donations trauchoma is the most effective, merely to give the most stunningly large difference in cost effectiveness between charitable donations used for comparable ends (both about blindness so no hard comparisons across kinds of suffering/disability).  </p>\n<p>I agree that within the EA community and when presenting EA analysis of cost-effectiveness it is important to be upfront with the full complexity of the figures.  However, <b>Singer's purpose at TED isn't to carefully pick the most cost effective donations but to force people to confront the fact that cost effectiveness matters.</b>.  While those of us already in EA might find a statement like &quot;We prevent 1 year of blindness for every 3 surgeries done which on average cost...&quot; perfectly compelling the audience members who aren't yet persuaded simply tune out.  After all it's just more math talk and they are interested in emotional impact.  The only way to convince them is to ignore getting the numbers perfectly right and focus on the emotional impact of choosing to help a blind person in the US get a dog rather than many people in poor countries avoid blindness.</p>\n<p>Now it's important that we don't simplify in misleading ways but even with the qualifications here it is obvious that it still costs orders of magnitude more to train a dog than prevent blindness via this surgery.   Moreover, once one factors in considerations like pain, the imperfect replacement for eyes provided by a dog, etc.. the original numbers are probably too favorable to dog training as far as relative cost effectiveness goes.</p>\n<p>This isn't to say that your point here isn't important regarding people inside EA making estimates or givewell analysis or the like.  I'm just pointing out that it's important to distinguish the kind of thing being done at a TED talk like this from that being done by givewell.  So long as when people leave the TED talk their research leaves the big picture in place (dogs &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; trauchoma surgery) it's a victory.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "TruePath"}}, {"_id": "6xDMq7fTW9ocHEBnE", "postedAt": "2017-05-11T08:44:16.871Z", "postId": "SMRHnGXirRNpvB8LJ", "htmlBody": "<p>I think there is truth in what you said.

I should have said &quot;preventing.&quot;  (I used to talk about curing blindness by performing cataract surgery, and that may be the cause of the slip.)  But there is a source for the figure I cited, and it is not GiveWell.  I give the details in The Most Good You Can Do&quot;, in an endnote on p. 194, but to save you all looking it up, here it is:</p>\n<p>&quot;I owe this comparison to Toby Ord, \u201cThe moral imperative towards cost-effectiveness,\u201d <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/sites/givingwhatwecan.org/files/attachments/moral_imperative.pdf\">http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/sites/givingwhatwecan.org/files/attachments/moral_imperative.pdf</a>. Ord suggests a figure of $20 for preventing blindness; I have been more conservative. Ord explains his estimate of the cost of providing a guide dog as follows: \u201cGuide Dogs of America estimate $19,000 for the training of the dog. When the cost of training the recipient to use the dog is included, the cost doubles to $38,000. Other guide dog providers give similar estimates, for example Seeing Eye estimates a total of $50,000 per person/dog partnership, while Guiding Eyes for the Blind estimates a total of $40,000.\u201d  His figure for the cost of preventing blindness by treating trachoma comes from Joseph Cook et al., \u201cLoss of vision and hearing,\u201d in Dean Jamison et al., eds., Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries, 2d ed. (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), 954. The figure Cook et al. give is $7.14 per surgery, with a 77 percent cure rate. I thank Brian Doolan of the Fred Hollows Foundation for discussion of his organization\u2019s claim that it can restore sight for $25. GiveWell suggests a figure of $100 for surgeries that prevent one to thirty years of blindness and another one to thirty years of low vision but cautions that the sources of these figures are not clear enough to justify a high level of confidence.&quot;</p>\n<p>Now, maybe there is some more recent research casting doubt on this figure, but note that the numbers I use allow that the figure may be $100 (typically, when I speak on this, I give a range, saying that for the cost of training one guide dog, we may be able to prevent somewhere between 400 - 1600 cases of blindness.  Probably it isn't necessary even to do that.  The point would be just as strong if it were 400, or even 40.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "PeterSinger"}}, {"_id": "XNZX7gLAE6yNjgr5P", "postedAt": "2017-05-12T23:31:18.285Z", "postId": "SMRHnGXirRNpvB8LJ", "htmlBody": "<p>I don't understand the objection about it being &quot;ableist&quot; to say funding should go towards preventing people becoming blind rather than training guide dogs</p>\n<p>If &quot;ableism&quot; is really supposed to be like racism or sexism, then we should not regard it as better to be able to see than to have the disability of not being able to see.

It\u2019s 77% cure rate for trachoma that sometimes develops into blindness. Not 77% cure rate for blindness. At least that\u2019s how I interpret it, I can\u2019t be sure because the cited source of the figure in the DCP2\u2019s table doesn\u2019t even mention trachoma! From what I\u2019ve read, sometimes recurrences happen so 77% cure rate from trachoma is much much more plausible. I'm afraid Toby Ord <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/sites/givingwhatwecan.org/files/attachments/moral_imperative.pdf\">made the mistake</a> of implying that curing trachoma = preventing blindness.</p>\n<p>What is more, Toby Ord used the same DCP2 report that GiveWell used and GiveWell found <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/09/29/errors-in-dcp2-cost-effectiveness-estimate-for-deworming/\">major errors</a> in it. To sum up very briefly:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Eventually, we were able to obtain the spreadsheet that was used to generate the $3.41/DALY estimate. That spreadsheet contains five separate errors that, when corrected, shift the estimated cost effectiveness of deworming from $3.41 to $326.43.\n[...]\nThe estimates on deworming are the only DCP2 figures we\u2019ve gotten enough information on to examine in-depth. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Regarding Fred Hollows Foundation, please see <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/charities/Fred-Hollows-Foundation\">GiveWell\u2019s page</a> about them and <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2008/07/21/preventing-blindness/\">this blog post</a>. In my eyes these discredit organization\u2019s claim that it restores sight for $25. </p>\n<p>In conclusion, without further research we have no basis for the claim that trachoma surgeries can prevent 400, or even 40 cases of blindness for $40,000. We simply don't know. I wish we did, I want to help those people in the video.</p>\n<p>I think one thing that is happening is that we <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selective_exposure_theory\">are too eager to believe any figures we find if they support an opinion we already hold</a>. That severely worsens already existing problem of <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/76k/the_optimizers_curse_and_how_to_beat_it/\">optimizer\u2019s curse</a>.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>I also want to add that preventing 400 blindness cases for $40,000 (i.e. one case for $100) to me sounds much more effective than top GiveWell's charities. GiveWell seem to agree, see citations from <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/cataract-surgery#ourCEA\">this page</a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Based on very rough guesses at major inputs, we estimate that cataract programs may cost $112-$1,250 per severe visual impairment reversed\n[...]\nBased on prior experience with cost-effectiveness analyses, we expect our estimate of cost per severe visual impairment reversed to increase with further evaluation.\n[...]\nOur rough estimate of the cost-effectiveness of cataract surgery suggests that it may be competitive with our priority programs; however, we retain a high degree of uncertainty.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>We tell the trachoma example and then advertise GiveWell, showing that GiveWell\u2019s top and standout charities are not even related to blindness and no one in EA ever talks about blindness. So people probably assume that GiveWell\u2019s recommended charities are much more effective than surgery that cures blindness for $100 but they are not.</p>\n<p>Because GiveWell\u2019s estimates for cataract surgeries are based on guesses, I think we shouldn\u2019t use those figures in introductory EA talks as well.

(It's also possible that using the example as it's typically used causes negative consequences by affecting how intellectually rigorous EA is, but that's another topic). A few different points that might be used to support this argument would be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On average, people get a lot of value out of having self-esteem; often, having more self-esteem on the margins enables them to do value-producing things they wouldn't have done otherwise (flow-through effects!). Sometimes, it just makes them a bit happier (probably a much smaller effect in utilitarian terms).</li>\n<li>Roughly, raising or lowering the group-wise esteem of a group has an effect on the self-esteem of some of the group's members.</li>\n<li>Keeping from lowering a group's esteem isn't very costly, if doing so involves nothing more than using a different tone. (There are of course situations where making a certain claim will raise or lower a group's esteem a large amount if a certain tone is used, and a lesser amount if a different tone is used, even though the group's esteem is nevertheless changed in the same direction in either case).</li>\n<li>Decreases in a group's ability to do value-producing things or be happy because their esteem has been lowered by someone acting in an ablelist manner, do not cause others to experience a similarly sized boost to their ability to be happy or do value-producing things. (I.e. the truth value of claims that &quot;status games are zero sum&quot; has little effect on the extent to which it's true that decreasing a group's esteem by e.g. ableist remarks has negative utilitarian consequences).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've generally found it hard to make this sort of observation publicly in EA-inhabited spaces, since I typically get interpreted as primarily trying to say something political, rather than primarily trying to point out that certain actions have certain consequences. It's legitimately hard to figure out what the ideal utilitarian combination of tone and example would be for this case, but it's possible to iterate towards better combinations of the two as you have time to try different things according to your own best judgement, or just ask a critic what the most hurtful parts of an example are.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "XNZX7gLAE6yNjgr5P", "user": {"username": "Fluttershy"}}, {"_id": "AWGdTczx6RW6Nrtge", "postedAt": "2017-05-14T01:26:15.387Z", "postId": "SMRHnGXirRNpvB8LJ", "htmlBody": "<p>I strongly agree with both of the comments you've written in this thread so far, but the last paragraph here seems especially important.

Fact-checking, updating, or just information flagging as older and possibly inaccurate was on our to-do list for materials on the Giving What We Can site, which go back as much as 10 years and sometimes no longer represent our best understanding.

(That's a strong disincentive for ever writing anything that includes a cost-effectiveness estimate, since they're always changing.) Does everyone who quoted it or referred to it need to go back each year and include a new estimate?

The figure from DCP2 for trachoma treatment directly references the primary source, so it's highly unlikely to be vulnerable to any spreadsheet errors.</p>\n<p>The table Toby cites and you reference here (Table 50.1 from DCP2) says &quot;trichiasis surgery&quot;. This means surgical treatment for a late stage of trachoma.  Trichiasis is not synonymous with trachoma, but a late and severe complication of trachoma infection, by which stage eyelashes are causing corneal friction. It doesn't 'sometimes' lead to blindness, though that is true of trachoma infections when the whole spectrum is considered. Trichiasis frequently causes corneal damage leading to visual impairment and blindness. You are right to point out that not every person with trichiasis will develop blindness, and a &quot;Number Needed to Treat&quot; is needed to correct the estimate from $20 per case of blindness prevented. However we don't have good epidemiological data to say whether that number is 1, 2, 10 or more. Looking at the literature it's likely to be closer to 2 than 10. The uncertainty factor encoded in Peter Singer's use of $100 per person would allow for a number needed to treat of 5. </p>\n<p>In this case the term &quot;cure&quot; is appropriate - as trichiasis is the condition being treated by surgery. At one point Toby's essay talks about curing blindness as well as curing trachoma. Strictly speaking trichiasis surgery is tertiary prevention (treatment of a condition which has already caused damage to prevent further damage.), but the error is not so egregious as to elicit the scorn of the hypothetical doctor you quote below.

It's fair to say evidence appraisal and communication really is a specialist area in its own right, and outside our ares of expertise it's common to make errors in doing so. And while we all like evidence confirms what we think, other biases may be at play. I think some people in effective altruism also put a high value on identifying and admitting mistakes, so we might also be quick to jump on a contrary assessment even if it has some errors of its own. </p>\n<p>I think your broader point about communicating the areas and extent of uncertainty is important, but the solution to how we do that when communicating in different domains is not simple. For example, you can look at how NICE investigates the efficacy of clinical interventions. They have to distill 1000's of pages of evidence into a decision, and even the 'summary' of that can be 100s of pages long. At the front of that will be an 'executive summary' which can't possibly capture all the ares of uncertainty and imperfect evidence, but usually represents their best assessment because ultimately they have to make concrete recommendations. </p>\n<p>Another approach is that seen in the Cochrane Systematic Reviews. These take a very careful approach to criticising the methodology of all studies included in their analysis. A running joke though its that every Cochrane review reaches the same conclusion: &quot;More Evidence is Needed&quot;. This is precise and careful, but often lacks any practical conclusion. </p>\n<p>Re your 2 questions:</p>\n<p>It's $7.14 for 1 eye (in 2001) with 77% success, according to this source:\n<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11471088\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11471088</a>\nIn Toby Ord's essay he uses this to derive the &quot;less than $20 per person&quot; figure (7.14 *2 /(0.77) = $18.5 )\n<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/sites/givingwhatwecan.org/files/attachments/moral_imperative.pdf\">https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/sites/givingwhatwecan.org/files/attachments/moral_imperative.pdf</a>\nSo that's both eyes (in 2001 terms). </p>\n<p>My main area of uncertainty on that figure is around number needed to treat. I've spoken to a colleague who is an ophthalmologist and has treated trichiasis in Ghana. Her response was &quot;trachoma with trichiasis always causes blindness&quot;. But in the absence of solid epidemiology to back it up, I think it's wise to allow for NNT being higher than 1. I would be comfortable with saying that for about $100 we can prevent trachoma-induced blindness, in order to contrast that with things that we consider a reasonable buy in other contexts. (I haven't assessed any orgs to know if there are orgs who do it for that little: they may for instance do surgeries on a wider range of conditions with varying DALYs gained per dollar spent).  </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "8K6Qypmd7MYsmovuZ", "user": {"username": "Bernadette_Young"}}, {"_id": "7jQ9XJHzRhgBCSm6E", "postedAt": "2017-05-17T14:26:43.711Z", "postId": "SMRHnGXirRNpvB8LJ", "htmlBody": "<p>Here\u2019s what I usually found most unfortunate about the comparison, but I don\u2019t mean to compete with anyone who thinks that the math is more unfortunate or anything else.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The decision to sacrifice the well-being of one person for that of others (even many others) should be hard. If we want to be trusted (and the whole point of GiveWell is that people don\u2019t have the time to double-check all research no matter how accessible it is \u2013 plus, even just following a link to GiveWell after watching a TED Talk requires that someone trusts us with their time), we need to signal clearly that we don\u2019t make such decisions lightly. It is honest signaling too, since the whole point of EA is to put a whole lot more effort into the decision than usual. Many people I talk to are so \u201cconscientious\u201d about such decisions that they shy away from them completely (implicitly making very bad decisions). It\u2019s probably impossible to show just how much effort and diligence has gone into such a difficult decision in just a short talk, so I rather focus on cases where I am, or each listener is, the one at whose detriment we make the prioritization decision, just like in the Child in the Pond case. Few people would no-platform me because they think it\u2019s evil of me to ruin my own suit.</li>\n<li>Sacrificing oneself, or rather some trivial luxury of oneself, also avoids the common objection why a discriminated against minority should have to pay when there are [insert all the commonly cited bad things like tax cuts for the most wealthy, military spending, inefficient health system, etc.]. It streamlines the communication a lot more.</li>\n<li>The group at whose detriment we need to decide should never be a known, discriminated against minority in such examples, because these people are used to being discriminated against and their allies are used to seeing them being discriminated against, so when someone seems to be saying that they shouldn\u2019t receive some form of assistance, they have just a huge prior for assuming that it\u2019s just another discriminatory attack. I think their heuristic more or less fails in this case, but that is not to say that it\u2019s not a very valid heuristic. I\u2019ve been abroad in a country where pedestrian crosswalks are generally ignored by car drivers. I\u2019m not going to just blinding walk onto the street there even if the driver of the only car coming toward me is actually one who would\u2019ve stopped for me if I did. My heuristic fails in that case, but it generally keeps me safe.</li>\n<li>Discriminated minority groups are super few, especially the ones the audience will be aware of. Some people may be able to come up with a dozen or so, some with several dozens. But in my actual prioritization decisions for the Your Siblings charity, I had to decide between groups of so fuzzy reference classes that there must be basically arbitrarily many of such groups. Street children vs. people at risk of malaria vs. farmed animals? Or street children in Kampala vs. people at risk of malaria in the southern DRC vs. chickens farmed for eggs in Spain? Or street children of the lost generation in the suburb\u2019s of Kampala who were abducted for child sacrifice but freed by the police and delivered to the orphanage we\u2019re cooperating with vs. \u2026. You get the idea. If we\u2019re unbiased, then what are the odds that we\u2019ll draw a discriminated against group from the countless potential examples in this urn? This should heavily update a listener toward thinking that there\u2019s some bias against the minority group at work here. Surely, the real explanation is something about salience on our minds or ease of communication and not about discrimination, but they\u2019d have to know us very well to have so much trust in our intentions.</li>\n<li>People with disability probably have distance \u201cbias\u201d at the same rates as anyone else, so they\u2019ll perceive the blind person with the guide dog as in-group, the blind people suffering from cataracts in developing countries as completely neutral foreign group, and us as attacking them, making us the out-group. Such controversy is completely avoidable and highly dangerous, as Owen Cotton-Barratt describes in more detail in his <a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/MovementGrowth.pdf\">paper on movement growth</a>. Controversy breeds an opposition (and one that is not willing to engage in moral trade with us) that destroys option value particularly by depriving us of the highly promising option to draw on the democratic process to push for the most uncontroversial implications of effective altruism that we can find. Scott Alexander has written about it under the title \u201cToxoplasma of Rage.\u201d I don\u2019t think publicity is worth sacrificing the political power of EA for it, but that is just a great simplification of Owen Cotton-Barratt\u2019s differentiated points on the topic.</li>\n<li>Communication is by necessity cooperative. If we say something, however true it may be, and important members of the audience understand it as something false or something else entirely (that may not have propositional nature), then we failed to communicate. When this happens, we can\u2019t just stamp our collective foot on the ground and be like, \u201cBut it\u2019s true! Look at the numbers!\u201d or \u201cIt\u2019s your fault you didn\u2019t understand me because you don\u2019t know where I\u2019m coming from!\u201d That\u2019s not the point of communication. We need to adapt our messaging or make sure that people at least don\u2019t misunderstand us in dangerous ways.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(I feel like you may disagree on some of these points for similar reasons that <em>The Point of View of the Universe</em> seemed to me to argue for a non-naturalist type of moral realism while I \u201conly\u201d try to assume some form of non-cognitivist moral antirealism, maybe emotivism, which seems more parsimonious to me. Maybe you feel like or have good reasons to think that there is a true language (albeit in a non-naturalist sense) so that it makes sense to say \u201cYes, you misunderstood me, but what I said is true, because \u2026,\u201d while I\u2019m unsure.
