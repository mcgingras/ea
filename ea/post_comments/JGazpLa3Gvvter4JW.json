Somewhat relatedly, I liked Veritasium video on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM&amp;ab_channel=Veritasium\">What Game Theory Reveals About Life, The Universe, and Everything</a>.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Spatio-temporal expanse.</strong>&nbsp;The universe is very plausibly spatially infinite.</p></blockquote><p>I do not think there is any empirical evidence for this. We can only measure finite quantities, so any measurement we make would be perfectly compatible with a large finite universe. In other words, empirical evidence can update one towards a larger universe, but not from a finite to an infinite one. So my understanding is that claims about the universe being infinite rest entirely on having a prior with some probability mass on this possibility.</p><blockquote><p>The universe is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flatness_problem\"><u>measured to be almost exactly flat</u></a>: to a first approximation, under a uniform prior and ignoring anthropic considerations, this gives us 50% probability that the universe is positively curved and therefore finite, and 50% probability that the universe is negatively curved and therefore infinite.</p></blockquote><p>Note the universe is measured to be almost exactly flat locally. If I am looking into a straight railway track which extends a few kilometers in my field of view, it would maybe not be reasonable for me to conclude it is infite in expectation. A reasonable probability density function (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_density_function\">PDF</a>) for its length would decay sufficiently fast to 0 as the length increases, such that the expected length is still finite. Similarly, even though the universe looks flat locally (like the Earth does in some places, even though it is not), I feel like it would be reasonable to have a PDF describing its size which decays to 0 as the size increases. The tail of the PDF would have to decay faster than the squared size for the expected size to be finite<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"7d7nvcjp4nt\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7d7nvcjp4nt\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7d7nvcjp4nt\">[1]</a></sup></span>.</p><ol class=\"footnote-section footnotes\" data-footnote-section=\"\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"7d7nvcjp4nt\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn7d7nvcjp4nt\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"7d7nvcjp4nt\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref7d7nvcjp4nt\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>The mean of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution\">Pareto distribution</a> would be infinite otherwise.</p></div></li></ol>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "vascoamaralgrilo"}}, {"_id": "X7ubKDr9TnrE6xcxZ", "postedAt": "2024-03-02T17:15:19.081Z", "postId": "JGazpLa3Gvvter4JW", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Vasco, I\u2019m having trouble parsing your comment.
