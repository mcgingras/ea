Since FTX increased overall funding, Open Phil could also grant more to EA Funds. However, there was no growth in the GH&amp;D fund because it has traditionally been majorly supported by direct donations. Open Phil still increased their funding of the area of GH&amp;D by increasing their grants to GiveWell. Open Phil <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/2021-allocation-to-givewell-top-charities-why-were-giving-more-going-forward/\">said</a> the following in November 2021:</p><blockquote><p>Today we are excited to announce our largest-to-date support for GiveWell\u2019s recommendations: $300 million for 2021, up from $100 million last year, with tentative plans[1] to donate an additional $500 million per year in 2022 and 2023.</p></blockquote><p>The growth plans did not materialise partly due to the collapse of FTX.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "vascoamaralgrilo"}}, {"_id": "ud4CjvbPueEJAADmM", "postedAt": "2024-02-10T12:41:01.051Z", "postId": "Nodk69mPSEAW2y65L", "htmlBody": "<p>Awesome work Ricardo!

If you look at the first graph, besides the drop in 2023 (data incomplete when I ran the analysis) the grants they gave followed an upward trajectory.This may be a language/semantic issue from my end as I use these interchangeably, but I'll look over the text and try to make sure this is clear.</p>\n<p>2- The graph you shared, I am assuming it corresponds only to individual donors donating to EA funds. This is one of my suggestions for EA funds, that they could be more explicit about this on the website so the information is easier to interpret. Either way, individual donations has clearly gone down, however overly grant giving has gone up. The two most obvious explanations for this are (1) they had built up a larger cash position that is being drawn down now and (2) they are receiving or have received more institutional funding that isn't represented in that graph.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "twCJXgr6NC8g3pLp4", "user": {"username": "Ricardo Pimentel"}}, {"_id": "94yHJpGR5cJ8YvhgG", "postedAt": "2024-02-12T01:54:18.935Z", "postId": "Nodk69mPSEAW2y65L", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>They probably updated the information.

I haven't interviewed our donors about this so I can't be sure, but my impression is that when the GH&amp;D fund first launched, there weren't any plausible competitors for donors for the niche of \"I want to figure out my own cause prioritization, but I want to defer to external experts to source and prioritize interventions and projects.\" But these days GiveWell manages a number of their own funds (as opposed to \"just\" writing up public recommendations for charities to suggest people give to), Giving What We Can has their own <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/en-US/best-charities-to-donate-to-2024#best-charities-for-global-health-and-wellbeing\">Global Health&amp;Wellbeing fund</a>, etc. &nbsp;</p><p>In contrast, EA Funds' other funds still retain an edge as arguably being the default place to donate to for those cause areas, for a reasonable subset of engaged donors.</p>", "parentCommentId": "CDtrBsBBomYMBjjZo", "user": {"username": "Linch"}}, {"_id": "7PTPyBh5FdxabhEF7", "postedAt": "2024-02-12T07:43:23.078Z", "postId": "Nodk69mPSEAW2y65L", "htmlBody": "<p>Nice point, Linch!

On the other hand, given this goal, I believe one had better donate to GiveWell\u2019s<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/all-grants-fund\">&nbsp;<u>All Grants Fund</u></a>&nbsp;(AGF) or<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/unrestricted-fund\">&nbsp;<u>unrestricted funds</u></a>&nbsp;(GWUF), or Giving What We Can\u2019s&nbsp;(GWWC\u2019s)<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charities/global-health-and-wellbeing-fund\">&nbsp;<u>Global Health and Wellbeing Fund</u></a>&nbsp;(GHWF). In addition, I encourage GHDF to:</p><ul><li>Let its donors know that donating to GHDF in its current form has a similar effect to donating to AGF (if that is in fact the case).</li><li>Consider appointing additional fund managers independent from GiveWell.</li><li>Consider accepting applications.</li></ul><p>In any case, the goal of this post is mostly about starting a discussion about the future of GHDF rather than providing super informed takes about it.
