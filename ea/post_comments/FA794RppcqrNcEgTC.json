I have been vegetarian since then.</p>\n<p>It wasn't until a few years later that I became more interested in a larger variety of issues, with my pet topics being environmentalism and feminism. I started doing political work when I was 16. I joined a left-wing political group that also focussed on a lot of other issues, like global poverty, democracy and animal rights. It was the first time in my life I met smart and dedicated people.</p>\n<p>Apart from that, I spent most of my time reading through all the non-fiction books in the library I could find. I had always wanted to go into academia. I think I started looking forward to doing a PhD when I was around 10.</p>\n<p>When I was 17 I found LessWrong. A year later someone who was also interested in LessWrong introduced me to EA and I started talking to the Swiss EA crowd. I had never previously thought about cause prioritisation and was really excited about the concept. This was in 2012.</p>\n<p>At the same time, I started a cultural anthropology degree.

I mostly regret now how I spent those years. I wish I had been around more people who were actually trying to do things which I cannot say about my local EA/LW network. Continuing political work would have been good, or moving to an EA Hub.

Reading this turned my personal, emotional choice into something which felt like a moral imperative. Despite never having engaged with any philosophy before, Singer's views felt almost like a manifesto of what I thought I believed in. I've been pretty staunchly utilitarian since (although I still haven't engaged very deeply with much philosophy).</p>\n<p>I knew that I wanted to contribute positively to the world through my career. Given that history was my favourite subject, it seemed like the best way to help the world was to become a history teacher. I fixed my career plans upon this, and didn't really consider any alternatives to this for years to come...</p>\n<p>When I went to university I had hoped to find an animal advocacy student society, but there was none, so I set one up within weeks, alongside a few other people.</p>\n<p>It was at uni that I first heard of Effective Altruism. Max Dalton (now at CEA) was at my college at uni and so was in my (extended) friendship group. He was heavily involved in the Oxford GWWC society. I didn't ever speak to Max about EA whilst I was at uni, but I'd guess that most undergrads in my college had heard of EA because of Max. I also went to hear Peter Singer gives talks twice while I was there, and I think one of the talks was about Effective Altruism (before I knew much about it); I don't remember it well, so it obviously didn't leave as much of an impression on me at the time as Animal Liberation had. I thought that EA sounded like a great idea, but that I couldn't engage with it yet, because I wasn't earning any money, and my understanding was that EA was about donating effectively. So I decided I would donate 10% of my income to effective charities once I started earning, but that there was nothing else I needed to do in the meantime.</p>\n<p>After my degree and 1 year teacher training course, I began working as a teacher and immediately began donating 10% of my income. I also started tentatively looking for potential EA-related volunteering opportunities (e.g. ACE) but nothing came of this at the time.</p>\n<p>I spoke to some uni friends who were at similar levels of support for EA as I was. They said they had taken the GWWC pledge. I decided to sign up, since I was already donating 10%.</p>\n<p>After signing up, David Nash (EA London) sent me an email asking if I'd like to come to EA London events. I said yes and asked how else I could get involved; I ended up taking over the majority of the organising of the Effective Animal Altruism London sub-group which he had set up with Saulius (another EA based in London) but didn't have much time to put into organising. </p>\n<p>My responsibility for this group (and my general interest) led to a period of deepening involvement in EA; trying to read as much as I could that came out relating to EA and animals and volunteering for several EAA organisations. At some point I decided that I wanted to change my career to have a greater positive impact; this was why I had chosen teaching in the first place anyway, I just hadn't thought the implications of this through. After  several months of agonising, speaking to various people and an 80K coaching call, I decided to work towards working directly in the Effective Animal Advocacy community (as opposed to focusing on building more flexible career capital). So I started an EAA blog, contiued to focus on reading into the area and my volunteering.</p>\n<p>A few months later, I have just started working full time as a researcher at Sentience Institute.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Jamie_Harris"}}, {"_id": "GGrruEZAvCxiJbRvd", "postedAt": "2018-08-08T22:02:23.741Z", "postId": "FA794RppcqrNcEgTC", "htmlBody": "<p>I think this is a great idea, and I was really interested, and also touched, by the stories people have already posted, so thank you all! Holly, I love the sentiment of \u201can extra dose of empathy and mutual appreciation\u201d \u2013 I feel like to some extent EA culture, or at least that of its online spaces like this one, is very good at hiding the many meaningful personal relationships that I know the community has fostered.</p>\n<p>I found EA in late 2012, just after I\u2019d started my first degree in Oxford. At the first meeting of the science fiction society (which I then never ended up going back to), someone pointed me towards HPMoR. I then looked it up when I got back to my room and read a bit of it, and then found someone talking about EA in the comments section. I never did read the rest of HPMoR until a long time later, and apart from that I\u2019ve never interacted with the rationalist community, so I always feel like this origin story is amusingly mismatched to me... Anyway, I then read about EA a bit on the internet, generally thought it was a great idea, and it sat around in the back of my mind for a while. About a year later, I think, I started regular EA-guided donations.</p>\n<p>I know for a fact that I\u2019ve changed a whole lot in the last six years, which I\u2019m happy about, because I really don\u2019t like six-years-ago me. When I started university (studying physics) I was \u2013 not remotely to say that I think all of these things are bad, of course, only some of them \u2013 very analytical in my approach to most things. I was entirely emotionally inept \u2013 I didn\u2019t really form emotional friendships (at least, not ones that were emotional from my side); I sometimes treated people rather badly, enough that I\u2019m pretty surprised looking back that some of my friends stayed with me, and I just really didn\u2019t understand most people\u2019s emotional needs, which often led me to be very judgemental and superior, including on moral issues. I liked having very long, theoretical conversations with my fellow students late into the night (that hasn\u2019t changed!), and I liked being reactionary and expressing opinions that were different enough to be shocking to others. Morally I think I was a pretty rigid deontologist. </p>\n<p>(As a point of interest, for a while afterwards, I held a <em>really weird</em> position of just-about-moral-realism, where I thought that what was, universally and really, right and wrong for one person, might be entirely different for another in the same situation \u2013 I thought that real morality existed, but depended on the actor about whom the question was being asked as much as the action. I had this way of visualising it that was of there being a little \u201cmoral bubble universe\u201d attached to each consciousness that was real, but that was only true for that one person, and each person had a moral sense pointing into that space, that could tell them only about what was right for them.)</p>\n<p>Once I encountered EA (which was at the time when it seemed to almost entirely concern charitable donations), I did agree with it wholeheartedly; being good is good, and being better is better. But, to be uncharitable to my earlier self, I also liked it because it let me dissociate morality and caring, and because the analytical, counter-intuitive, and just plain unusual nature of it fit well with my, I suppose, aesthetics of ideas at the time.</p>\n<p>I didn\u2019t do a lot more with EA other than read about it and direct my donations, and donate increasing (but still small) amounts for a long while after. In 2015 I finished my physics degree and moved to Cambridge, to start a second undergraduate degree in medieval languages. I read a lot more about EA, on the internet and Doing Good Better once that came out, and also started donating more, and eventually took the Pledge last year. However I didn\u2019t do anything with the Cambridge EA group other than go to one formal hall and hang about on their mailing list. Looking back, I think this was because my plan at the time was firmly to remain in academia in the humanities, and I think I had some guilt over the fact that as someone who felt like I knew a fair bit about EA by now, should probably be using it to direct my career, but didn\u2019t want to and so felt vaguely uncomfortable (although of course I shouldn\u2019t have) about the idea of mixing with lots of core EAs.</p>\n<p>Compared to the me described above, by maybe two years ago, I\u2019d changed a whole lot (fortunately) \u2013 I\u2019d become actually vaguely emotionally capable, both in understanding others\u2019 feelings and my own. I\u2019ve been able to make a wonderful group of close emotional friendships, and I think (hope?) that I\u2019ve become a much more pleasant person to know since I became able to care. While I certainly do still like to be analytical, and think things through properly (and this is a good thing), my opinions have mostly become a whole lot more mainstream and acceptable on many matters as I worked out that on thing after thing, the norms that society\u2019s settled on are actually often pretty good to follow \u2013 I have also entirely changed on political opinions, from pretty rigidly conservative to pretty radically left-wing. I\u2019m now certainly a consequentialist morally speaking, although I haven\u2019t worked out precisely what kind yet. (Preference utilitarianism appeals the most to me, but doesn\u2019t satisfy, and I\u2019m nowhere near a satisfying position on population ethics.)</p>\n<p>I definitely still fully identify with EA; in some ways it\u2019s the most prominent belief that I feel I\u2019ve actually stuck with, but my reasons for appreciating EA have definitely changed. Obviously a big part of it is still that EA is simply morally correct. However I feel now, if I may risk getting somewhat floaty, more like I\u2019m an effective altruist because I care about people, because I feel like I\u2019m part of a global community of humanity, and it\u2019s tragic that there are so many people who suffer, people who are just like the friends I love in everything except that they were born in the wrong house; it\u2019s tragic that we can\u2019t help them all, and EA is important to me because tells me how we can make the world the biggest little bit less terrible that we can. I also love the idea of EA as a real community of people dedicated to doing good.</p>\n<p>Soon after starting my masters course (still medieval languages) I realised I was much less certain about doing a PhD than I had thought, and didn\u2019t apply for one, instead planning to take a year out and think about what I wanted to do. Since then, I had a bit of an EA renaissance (not that I\u2019d particularly had an off period), started reading things a lot more, listening to the podcasts, went to a couple of EA Cambridge events, talked about things more with the one of my closest friends who is very involved in the Cambridge community. When I read the 80,000 Hours article about operations work, that really clicked with me as I didn\u2019t feel most of the other direct work profiles had, and I ended up getting advice from a couple of CEA people, and now plan to work at something relevant for the next year while I\u2019m committed to living in Cambridge with my friends here, then look for something directly effective after that. </p>\n<p>Thank you also for posting something that I felt confident enough to reply to \u2013 I\u2019ve been reading the forum for ages but never yet managed to comment on anything. Hopefully it will be easier now!

I tried to create the &quot;Environment Club&quot; at my school. I still have some documents, in French, from that time (around 2006).</p>\n<p>Here is an extract form a Microsoft Word document called &quot;convincing.doc&quot;, last edited in March 2006:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Step n\u00b01 : raise awareness about the destruction of the environment  </p>\n<p>Step n\u00b02 : convince to act  </p>\n<p>Step n\u00b03 : act </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I made a leaflet explaining pollution and the greenhouse effect in Microsoft PowerPoint. It included slogans such as &quot;Destroying our environment is destroying our future&quot; and &quot;acid rain: danger!&quot;, in WordArt, of course.</p>\n<p>In another document called &quot;PROJECTS.doc&quot;:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>SECONDARY PROJECT OF THE CLUB</p>\n<p>Because it is spring, there are many ladybirds in the school courtyard. So children capture them for fun: the club must prevent these children from capturing them, or, if they have already captured them, deliver them. For a tactic, see below.

I immediately saw the appeal of randomised trials: Science! Plus, the book contained a good amount of Malcolm-Gladwell-style counter-intuitive &quot;insight porn&quot;, which I was very fond of at the time.</p>\n<p>The book made me realise the scale of global poverty. I was especially impressed by the possibility of substantially helping the very poor with only cheap interventions. I started having thoughts which I would now recognise as consequentialist: &quot;You can help kids get vaccinated using just a bag of lentils (!); this is SO IMPORTANT! Why the hell isn't everyone talking about this?&quot;.</p>\n<p>Eventually I continued on with my life. Perhaps I figured that if no-one around me cared about global poverty, it couldn't be that important. But there remained some cognitive dissonance.</p>\n<p>When I was 16 my dad gave me &quot;The Life You Can Save&quot; as a gift. The book made an explicit, unabashed case for the beliefs which had been implicitly floating at the back of my mind. It was illuminating. I decided that helping the global poor was in fact the most important thing, other people's indifference be damned! Although I did check out GiveWell's website briefly, I didn't dive in deeper, nor did I become aware of other online EA materials. This must have been 2012. </p>\n<p>(My dad later told me that he had hesitated about giving me &quot;The Life You Can Save&quot;, lest it come off as too preachy.)</p>\n<p>Because of inertia, or because these ideas take time to sediment, I didn't actually change my behaviour for at least another few years. At some point between the ages of 16 and 18, my interest in global poverty grew from a trickle to a flood. By the end of 2014, the year I left school, I was aware of Giving What We Can, and was reading more and more about EA. I devoured the websites of GiveWell, 80,000 Hours, and so on. I went vegetarian that year (although at first mostly for environmental reasons); then I volunteered remotely for The Life You Can Save in my first year of university in Paris. After I got an offer to go to Oxford in 2015, I decided to apply for a summer internship at Giving What We Can.</p>\n<p>The internship, in the summer of 2015, was a mind-blowing dive into the EA community. Suddenly I was in an office full of impressively smart people who shared my values and my thinking style.

Table-tennis is a unique game because it takes a lot of concentration, yet it is possible to have a fully engaged conversation with your opponent at the same time. Back and forth, we talked. I said something like this:</p>\n<p>\u201cI\u2019m gonna start a PhD soon. I\u2019ll earn a small stipend. Based on how much living has cost over the last few years, I\u2019ll still have a lot left over. Then I\u2019ll graduate and earn more money, and have more left over. Other people surely need this surplus money more than me. So I should give some of it away.\u201d</p>\n<p>At the same time, I was trying to make better financial decisions, and was dabbling in financial investment. So I asked my brother a question:</p>\n<p>\u201cWith this leftover money, is it best to give it to charity now or to invest it and give it later?\u201d</p>\n<p>We threw around some ideas about compound interest, duty to help now, problems now being worse than problems later, and that we might learn more later to give in a more impactful way. We didn\u2019t get very far with the discussion, so I Googled it. The words \u201cEffective Altruism\u201d kept cropping up, and I found my way to Peter Singer\u2019s TED talk.</p>\n<p>I was already convinced by Peter Singer\u2019s anti-speciesist arguments against eating animal products, as I had been vegan for about a year, so it was intriguing to hear about other philosophical stances he argues for. His talk piqued my interest in EA, which, with the aid of our local EA group, has slowly drawn me further and further into its logical and compassionate underworld.</p>\n<p>I had dabbled with various social and intellectual movements previously, but had always felt something not quite right. Some were to insular, some too tribal, some lacking in good intellectual practices, with misaligned incentives. What I loves about EA, that other groups I have dabbled with in the past, is its ability to self criticise, to learn, to change its mind, to accept that we might be wrong, and that other people might be right, but to try to listen to all parties, and to get as close to the right answers as we can be. I also was drawn in by the idea that this movement is not be bound to an arbitrary cause, rather it is about finding correct answers to one of the most fundamental questions we face: how can we do the most good?</p>\n<p>Since then, I have met some of the best people I know, I have changed my mind a lot, and I have improved in many areas of my life. I am now the chair of my city's local group, I volunteer for an EA-aligned organisation, and I am planning on moving from researching mathematics to something closer to what the world needs once I finish my PhD.
