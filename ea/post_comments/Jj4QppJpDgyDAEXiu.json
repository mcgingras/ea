Reading the left-ward bits can always be assumed to function as a summary of an outline (and author's fault if it doesn't).&nbsp;<br><br>[EDIT: This is what Angelina Li did above, nice :) Hopefully if anyone finds any bit intriguing, they go read more in the source :)<br><br>The rest is me reflecting on EAs and appropriateness of summaries vs different types of info-gleaning]<br><br>I'm not confident that summarizing pieces like this for an EA audience [like, typical summary paragraph-style] really works tbh. Different EAs will need very different things from it. Eg, community builders will be way more interested in the CB section and want to read it in detail even if they disagree, so as to understand the modes of thinking that others might adopt and what they might want to refute or adapt to.&nbsp;</p><p>This is also, after all, just someone's personal reflections and won't necessarily be the way EAs move forward on any of these things. And for reflections, summaries often cut reasoning and therefore lead to information cascades that need to be addressed later, I think. We already have way too much deference and information cascades in EA anyway, so I'd rather see people lean more toward engaging with material semi-deeply that is relevant to them or not repeat ideas at all tbh. This leads me to say that each reader should be proactive [by reading the bolded/leftward parts of the the outline themselves], and try to sort out the bits they care about or want to improve their thinking on and read anything further on that carefully.&nbsp;<br><br>It's totally okay to say \"this isn't really my bag, and I trust others to get it right eventually, so I'm not gonna engage with this\". And if you don't trust others to get it right eventually (and the FTX debacle is certainly around a low-trust theme), I still think EAs should engage semi-deeply (enough to evaluate trust in others or actually do the better job yourself) or hardly at all (even if this means pulling back from EA til you have the spoons to check-in deeply on your concerns), because engaging lightly will probably only waste your time, confuse discussion, and waste the time of others if they retroactively have to correct misunderstandings that spread thanks to poor-quality/surface-level engagement. [I've gone on a long time which makes it sound like a big ask, but honestly I am just talking about semi-deep engagement (eg, reading the leftward parts of the full outline as the author intended when in flow with the work and any further details as needed) vs light engagement (reading a summary which I don't think works for long pieces like this), <strong>not</strong> mandating very-deep engagement (reading the piece in full detail). So I think most people can do it.]<br><br>That said, I appreciate your sentiment, and I think a table of contents and better section titles would be extremely helpful for easier semi-deep engagement. Also, using numbered outline instead of bullet points. I think these are also easier asks less likely to get future posts hung up in procrastination-land.</p>", "parentCommentId": "nEucXa8yoBAGhqsXs", "user": {"username": "Ivy_Mazzola"}}, {"_id": "mSeb7hARJpSzSkrHQ", "postedAt": "2023-03-30T19:36:53.814Z", "postId": "Jj4QppJpDgyDAEXiu", "htmlBody": "<p>Here\u2019s just the headings from the updates + implications sections, lightly reformatted.

I feel confused about the scale on some of these. For example:</p><blockquote><p>it now somewhat less appears that a competent group of EAs could expect to do well in arbitrary industries... \u201cHow exceptional are EAs, compared to other social groups?\u201d: 5/10 \u2192 3/10</p></blockquote><p>Pre-FTX collapse, an EA was the richest self-made person in the world under 30 after having switched to an industry they had no experience in (crypto), and this is evaluated as 5/10 ability to do well in arbitrary industries? What is the scale here? What are social groups that are 10/10? Is the claim that Sam was 10/10 but the rest of us were 1/10 so it averages out to 5/10? But weren't something like &gt;0.1% of EAs billionaires at that point? Surely that's at like the 99th percentile of billionaire density for social groups?&nbsp;</p><p>And we are currently 3/10? The fact that most EA's have the right to work in an OECD country seems like it automatically should put us at at least the 80th percentile or something?</p><p>Maybe this is pedantic, but this lack of precision on the scale makes it hard for me to interpret the strength of these updates. E.g. if Owen is making the claim that EA's have below-average ability amongst humans to accomplish arbitrary business goals (which is my na\u00efve interpretation of the 3/10 rating) then this seems like a really strong and surprising claim.</p><p>(Note: I'm more sympathetic to the claim that EAs do things that are impactful in absolute value but have a negative sign, so the overall net impact is lower.
