I think I disagree with you. :) I have some broad ideas about setting up a great application process. I guess a high-level summary would be something like:</p><ul><li>know what you are looking for</li><li>know what criteria/traits/characteristics/skill/etc. predict what you are looking for</li><li>have methods you can use to assess/measure those criteria</li><li>assess the applicants using those methods</li></ul><p>The implementation of it can be quite complicated and the details will vary massively depending on circumstances, but at a basic level that is what it is: know what you are looking for, and measure it. I think this is a lot harder in a small organization, but there are still aspects that can be used.</p><p>I don't want anyone to think that I am an expert who knows everything about applications. I'm just a guy that reads about this kind of thing and thinks about this kind of thing.

I'm wondering what part of the \"selecting people for a job\" model is transferrable and applicable to the \"selecting people for a research program, grant, etc.\"</p><p>In those circumstances, I'm guessing that there are specific criteria you are looking for, and it might just be a matter of shifting away from vibes &amp; gut feelings and towards trying to verbalize/clarify what the criteria are.

The goals of AI Safety Camp are to provide people with both the motivation to work on AI safety and the skills to work on AI safety, so let's see A) how many people in the cohort are working on AI safety, and B) how much they are contributing or how much of a positive impact they are having. Then we look at the applications that they submitted X years ago to join AI Safety camp, and see what criteria those applications have that they have.</p></blockquote><p>I'm not good enough at data analysis to be able to pull much info, but there likely would be differences (of course, in reality it would have to be a pretty big sample size in order for any effects to not be overwhelmed by the random noise of life that has happened in the intervening X years). So although this little thought experiment is a bit silly and simplistic, we can still imagine the idea.</p>", "parentCommentId": "hHaZqELGt5wL6KwBJ", "user": {"username": "jlemien"}}, {"_id": "WtXMg6uDPWcb9Nn6e", "postedAt": "2023-04-01T23:01:04.204Z", "postId": "72Ya3vqouY9HHTwMt", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for writing this analysis! I agree with a most of it. One other argument I've heard for not providing feedback after job applications is that it carries legal risk. What the risk is specifically, I don't know \u2013 perhaps a candidate could sue you for discrimination if you inadvertently choose the wrong words? A way to mitigate this risk is the phrase \u2018You didn't demonstrate\u2026 [mastery of Python, facility in calming down angry customers, whatever]\u2019. It avoids making statements about the candidate in general and instead focuses on their behaviour during the application process, which you've observed.

Here's a few things that have made for good rejections in my experience:</p><ul><li>Listing the number of spots and number of applicants</li><li>Providing general characteristics of applications that were successful, and noting trends in those that were unsuccessful if possible</li><li>Giving resources one can engage with to possibly become a competitive applicant in the future (i.e. sending someone who got rejected from a role in Nuclear research to <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/N4oG4jMZRkbaKuPZF/nuclear-risk-research-ideas-summary-and-introduction\">Aird's compilation of nuclear research questions</a>, and encouraging them to engage with them)</li></ul><p>Post forthcoming on my thoughts on this from an extensive end user side, but thanks for opening up dialogue, much appreciated.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "tswizzle96"}}]
