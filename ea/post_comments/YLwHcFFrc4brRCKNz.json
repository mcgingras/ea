If you donate several thousand dollars per year, or in excess of that, and you don't believe your donation preferences will change much, it may make sense to let organizations know you expect to donate to them for several years.</p>\n<p><strong>Long Answer</strong></p>\n<p>The following answer is based on my experience as having previously worked for a charity fundraising company, been a regular monthly donor to World Animal Protection, and the experiences of myself and other supporters of effective altruism as donors.</p>\n<p><strong>Donations In General</strong></p>\n<p>Based on work and personal experience, it seems most charities, and non-profits, are much more concerned with their short- and medium-term operation and goals. That's because the continuance of the organization is based on meeting these goals, and achieving long-term goals is based upon the organization still existing, e.g., several years from now. Thus, my impression is that most charities and non-profits are relieved enough that their base of doors lets them know they'll continue to donate on a monthly basis, never mind an annual one. </p>\n<p>Of course, organizations want this information because it gives them a confidence interval for much funding they'll receive, which in turn dictates their budget for operations and projects. The biggest donors to an organization will have the greatest impact on an organization's budget, and its expectations of future funding. These donors are the ones organizations will focus on getting information on donation plans from on a year-to-year basis. Ask yourself: are you among the biggest donors to an organization?</p>\n<p>As an example, the Machine Intelligence Research Institute publishes a [list of its top donors] over its history. A 'top donor' is someone who has donated =&gt;$5000 USD to the MIRI. Animal Charity Evaluators[2] also publishes a list of [top donors], one of their 'top donors' being someone who donates =&gt;$1000. The MIRI has existed longer than ACE has, and also has a greater operating budget. So, what would qualify you as a 'top donor' varies by organization. If you believe you fall into the category of 'top donor' to an organization, and will do so in the future, making a multi-year commitment may make sense. If you don't know the answer to the question, you can always ask the organization. </p>\n<p>Just ask them, out of curiosity, what percentage your donation makes up of their total operating budget, and how much your regular donations impact their medium-term budget planning. At this point, you have no obligation to disclose you're considering a multi-year commitment to donating to the organization in question.</p>\n<p><strong>Donations and Effective Altruism</strong></p>\n<p>I believe the concerns of donors influenced by effective altruism make it so making a multi-year commitment to an organization that you expect to donate to them is not as good an idea. </p>\n<p>First of all, effective organizations, such as Givewell-recommended charities, may run into <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Room_for_more_funding\">room for more funding issues</a>. This means organizations may hit a point at which the marginal donation to that organization will do less good than the same amount donated to a different organization. For example, at the end of 2013, Givewell believed its normally top-recommended charity, the Against Malaria Foundation, hadn't distributed enough malaria bed nets, or had the capacity to effectively allocate funds, such that Givewell recommended GiveDirectly as its top charity over Against Malaria Foundation for most of 2014. This was controversial within effective altruism, as several individuals, and also Giving What We Can, disagreed with Givewell's analysis and conclusion on regarding the AMF. </p>\n<p>Anyway, similar issues may be raised in the future. Now, in a way, most of us don't believe ourselves as capable or experienced as Givewell or Giving What We Can to evaluate charities. So, we trust them to do so on behalf of the movement. If, as an individual, you make a multi-year commitment to organization, it may be awkward in future years when a charity evaluator you trust no longer recommends that organization as the 'best place to donate'. Given that effective altruism focuses on supporting the most effective organizations for any present time, what's considered 'the best place to donate' may change relatively quickly. This would render a multi-year donation commitment sub-optimal, and may hurt your relationship with the organization.</p>\n<p>Of course, some of us donated lots of money to the Against Malaria Foundation in 2013, then switched to GiveDirectly in 2014, and will resume donating to the AMF in 2015, now that it's Givewell's top recommendation again. Still, the opportunity for such flexibility is still a point against a multi-year commitment.</p>\n<p>Some causes areas are popular within effective altruism because to some they seem very neglected, or hold lots of value, even though they're not as tractable as global poverty. Such cause areas include animal advocacy, or existential risk reduction. By 'tractable', I mean to what extent we're confident what we do in the present will lead to desired goods in the future. Sometimes figuring if a cause area is tractable is difficult because the evidence to reach a conclusion hasn't been collected or evaluated yet, or because building an evidence base just seems too difficult. </p>\n<p>Now, the MIRI, and ACE, are organizations working within cause areas for which it's much more difficult to discern how effective and positive financial and other support in the present will be. However, I believe that the novel introduction of greater effectiveness to cause areas may change them such that evaluating their tractability will be more possible. At such a point, you as an individual, or the effective altruism community at large, may conclude organizations within your selected cause area are more or less effective than you once though. So, this could shift your donation priorities within a couple of years. Thus, I believe accounting for this level of uncertainty about the effectiveness of a given organization over time is another mark against making multi-year commitments. </p>\n<p>As someone who isn't very confident in which cause area, let alone which charity, may be the most effective target for donations, I wouldn't be making a multi-year commitment for donation even if I had the funds to justify such a thing. If you're extremely confident a single organization is the best, or confident in a single organization within the best cause area, a multi-year commitment could still make sense. However, keep in mind you may be biased if you're (one of) the only supporters of effective altruism with such high confidence in this organization. </p>\n<p>In conclusion, I believe from the perspective of effective altruism, making a multi-year commitment to organizations for donation based is usually an imprudent course of action.</p>\n<p>[1] The MIRI is an organization within the cause area of existential risk reduction, and supporters of effective altruism provide a great share of the total sum of donations it receives.</p>\n<p>[2] Animal Charity Evaluators is an organization mirroring Givewell, in that it evaluates and recommends for donations organizations focused on helping non-human animals, as Givewell does for organizations in the domain of global poverty and public health in the developing world. ACE was incubated by the Centre for Effective Altruism in Oxford, England, but now operates independently out of the United States. It is an organization central to the intersection of animal advocacy and effective altruism.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "R7KR5mHKwKKmZh9zj", "user": {"username": "Evan_Gaensbauer"}}, {"_id": "2LSvudNErqeo7cY8z", "postedAt": "2015-01-20T08:00:38.022Z", "postId": "YLwHcFFrc4brRCKNz", "htmlBody": "<p>I want to publish several posts on this forum in the coming weeks.

Feel free to comment which ones you'd be willing to review below, or send me a private message. I may draft some of these posts in Google Docs, or another word processor, before I publish them, so send me a private message with your email if you like. Just comment below if you're generally willing to review them, instead of any particular ones:</p>\n<p><strong>Does It Make Sense to Make A Multi-Year Donation Commitment to A Single Organization?</strong>\nEssentially, <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/e0/january_open_thread/2ea\">this already published comment</a></p>\n<p><strong>What <em>Doesn't</em> Count As Effective Altruism?</strong>\nRob Wiblin presented a talk at the 2014 Effective Altruism Summit entitled 'What is Effective Altruism?' Posting a summary of the whole talk on this forum seems redundant, but near the end Mr. Wiblin covered what, at least from the perspective of himself and the Centre for Effective Altruism, what's disqualified from effective altruism. I believe this may make a good post. If the idea of this post raises red flags in your mind about possible controversy, I anticipate that, and you're also welcome to review my post before I publish it.</p>\n<p><strong>Neglectedness, Tractability, and Importance/Value</strong>\nThe idea of heuristically identifying a cause area based on these three criteria was more or less a theme of the 2014 Effective Altruism Summit. This three-prong approach was independently highlighted by Peter Thiel, not just for non-profit work but entrepreneurship and and innovation more generally, and Holden Karnofsky, as the basis for how the Open Philanthropy Project asks questions about what cause areas to consider. Several months ago I discussed with Owen Cotton-Barratt publishing a post on this subject, or perhaps coauthoring it. Still, that hasn't happened from either of us yet, so I'll definitely be doing it, seeking input from yourself as well.</p>\n<p><strong>Effective Collaboration</strong>\nMichael Vassar gave a small lightning-talk at the 2014 Effective Altruism Summit on how organizations and others within the effective altruism movement may better collaborate. In his opinion, there is or was a dearth of this within the movement, and that's a problem. I'd like to interview or contact Mr. Vassar about this, as my notes are incomplete. If I can't achieve that, I likely won't publish this post unless others come forward with their detailed perspectives on this issue.</p>\n<p><strong>Volunteer and Human Resource Coordination</strong>\nThis would be a followup to the above post, with possible intent to launch or coordinate a project. Vassar noted as an aside that the effective altruism movement may greatly benefit from having something like a COO between organizations, or something like a super-secretary. This could be a person, perhaps full-time, completely dedicated to getting all of effective altruism's logistical ducks in a row. This seems an important intermediate role. It may be fitting to have this organized by the Centre For Effective Altruism. However, just in case, this post may survey .impact and other effective altruist coalitions in an effort towards greater coordination and communication between everyone.</p>\n<p><strong>Crowdfunding and Effective Altruism</strong>\nThis would be a post exploring how to use crowdfunding effectively, how it's previously been used across the world for effective causes, and what future potential it may hold for effective altruism. As I write this, I realize this post would also need to differentiate crowdfunding versus normal fundraising, and what the advantages and disadvantages of crowdfunding might be relative to normal fundraising. If you have experience in organizing either normal fundraisers, or crowdfunding campaigns, your input would especially be appreciated.</p>\n<p><strong>What Role Do Small-to-Medium Donors Play In the Future of Effective Altruism</strong>\nIn the face of individuals such as Elon Musk and Peter Thiel making large donations to effective organizations, and cause areas, to the tune of millions of dollars, and in the near future Good Ventures throwing tens, perhaps hundreds, of millions of dollars at effective causes and charities, I anticipate they may exhaust giving opportunities presently available and sensible for most of us. Most of us won't become multi-millionaires, presumably. Even in the face of donating four- or five-figure sums each year, an extremely high net-worth donor or foundation may render redundant the efforts of tens or hundreds of other effective altruists earning to give. Whether its funding our currently recommended charities to the point of room for more funding issues in one fell swoop, or the most effective cause areas requiring only huge donations to be tractable, such as policy advocacy, it poses an issue. I feel like this may pose an identity crisis for effective altruism, and may change how, e.g., 80,000 Hours recommends effective altruists enter earning to give as a career.</p>\n<p><strong>Reevaluating Earning to Give</strong>\nThis post would be related to the above, and its implications for earning to give. Also, I'd be seeking arguments both for and against earning to give as a career option worth pursuing from within the effective altruism movement, but not from 80,000 Hours.</p>\n<p><strong>Member Perspectives on 80,000 Hours</strong>\nThis post would be a retrospective and a set of critiques on how various members of 80,000 Hours think of its performance. This could range from general satisfaction with the organization, to measured evaluations of specific outcomes from 80,000 Hours. This would deliberately seeking input from others, like myself, who don't have an affiliation with 80,000 Hours beyond latent membership.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Evan_Gaensbauer"}}, {"_id": "92uxJ3pDB2A3emrqn", "postedAt": "2015-01-20T08:41:53.204Z", "postId": "YLwHcFFrc4brRCKNz", "htmlBody": "<p>Improving private messaging so that you can compose a message to any user from their user page is my priority in this domain.

I'm generally able to work myself up to applying to a job or internship when I have enough time to-- at its worst, the process generally involves me taking 1-2 hours to think about how unintelligent and useless I am, after which I am able to sit down and go through the process of actually applying to the position in question. </p>\n<p>I am in a position where I could either do a summer internship and then go to graduate school, or go directly into the workforce.

I'm glad you find writing about it therapeutic. One thing you can try - it's worked for me - is to write down a &quot;toolbox&quot; of things (such as writing) that allow you to feel better about yourself when you're feeling bad.</p>\n<p>This could even include taking 1-2 hours to criticize yourself - if that's what works for you. But having other options might help. Writing them down somewhere visible can help too.</p>\n<p>The reason I'm bringing this up is that - for me at least - the mindframe you describe isn't helpful for making big decisions, or even for applying to jobs. So I think that knowing when you're at your best and knowing some things you can try to help you return to that state, is great.</p>\n<p>Also really sorry to hear that you're feeling low status on account of a successful role-model. I've felt that one too, although for me it wasn't a parent but rather other members of the EA community who I saw as having accomplished more than I had. I'd love if there was some neat package of advice I could give here, but the only way out I know of involves a lot of grit - gradually learning to compare yourself to your own standards and finding success spirals.</p>\n<p>It's really sweet and amazing that you're not blaming anyone in the community for making you feel this way - I know it's not anyone's intention to get you to choose a career you're not at all passionate about for EA reasons, but some of the advice can sometimes sound a bit like that.</p>\n<p>Also bear in mind that the career advice from 80,000 Hours isn't to get it right first time, but to allow yourself room to explore and find new directions. Some high-profile EAs have done exactly that, doing a career u-turn when they discover some other path that for them is more effective or more satisfying. So it may be that there's a fun, fulfilling career out there for you - that's effective in helping others - and that lies outside of STEM. Or maybe your current field is right for you after all, and you just need to find the right people to make it exciting for you.</p>\n<p>Good luck, and thanks so much for opening up.

However, I'm still concerned because effective altruism doesn't involve normal philanthropy, or charitable giving. Thanks for responding, as this spurs me to state my case for why effective altruism is a unique movement for which we might need to take special considerations. I count explaining my rationale here in dialogue as drafting my essay on the topic.</p>\n<p>For its classic charity recommendations, Givewell is rigorous, and evaluates its top charities of having hit a point of room for more funding issues at the point of a one of those charities receiving, e.g., &gt;= $10 million USD in a single year. The demotion of the AMF from the most recommended charity in 2013 is an example of this. A foundation like Good Ventures could fund these top charities to the point at which each and all of them are not the best marginal donation target. From there, Givewell may be at a present loss   for finding the <em>next</em> best set of charities to recommend. With it, effective altruism at large might be at a loss. Lots of people like myself and others I've observed are uncertain enough about what is the best donation target that we're too reluctant to make 3- or 4-figure sum donations to any other charities.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the Open Philanthropy Project seeks to release in the next year recommendations to Good Ventures to support efforts to reform criminal justice or immigration policy in the United States, or fund large-scale research efforts. From the perspective of a foundation like Good Ventures, such efforts could do good on a massive scale, and are worth funding even if it requires one million dollars or more to discover if any good can be achieved. From the perspective of the average supporter of effective altruism, such an opportunity is backed by less evidence as robust as Givewell's classic recommendations, and entails much more risk. A multi-million dollar foundation can afford the much higher risks to reap much higher rewards than individuals.</p>\n<p>In conjunction, I worry these two issues may squish us smaller donors. If donation is the most obvious effective way of doing good, but it becomes redundant for small-to-medium donors to donate in the name of the best altruistic opportunities, we're at a loss. Effective altruism is dedicated to seeking the best ways of doing good. If lots of us build our careers on donating to the best causes, but our financial contributions become negligible, what next?</p>\n<p>We may reach the point that earning to give isn't the best common recommendation for doing good, at which point 80,000 Hours and effective altruism at large may be giving expired advice to several hundred individuals. At this point, informing individuals to seek careers which will allow them to donate more may no longer be the best recommendation. Additionally, I feel it would be irresponsible of effective altruism to recommend those aspiring to do the most good they can to pursue a career of earning to give, when the complete picture begins informing us that isn't their best option.</p>\n<p>At this point, my point is bleeding into my idea of &quot;Reevaluating Earning to Give&quot;, which is a related but separate topic.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "WLRFWtAJutwWdhSSe", "user": {"username": "Evan_Gaensbauer"}}, {"_id": "kcom3rN9mGKXxsCGa", "postedAt": "2015-01-24T16:01:36.292Z", "postId": "YLwHcFFrc4brRCKNz", "htmlBody": "<p>I don't consider this rambling.

For example, every organization seeking to reduce existential risk reduction we can think of could hit points at which further donation isn't a good giving opportunity. </p>\n<p>This scenario isn't too implausible. The Future of Life Institute could grant the $10 million donation it received from Elon Musk to the MIRI, the FHI, and all other low-hanging fruits for existential risk reduction.

I call this &quot;growing bigger&quot;. Ostensibly, this is also in large part the current mission of the Centre for Effective Altruism, and its &quot;Effective Altruism Outreach&quot;. Anna Salamon of the Center For Applied Rationality seemed skeptical of this approach as best use of recursion to improve the movement. She espoused the perspective that supporters of effective altruism, both as individuals and as a whole community, might be better to ensure the community self-improves, increasing the movement's legitimate self-confidence that it can achieve the good outcomes desired. In other words, she posits increasing the good <em>each</em> effective altruist can do, and the absolute good expected from <em>per individual</em> would be the way to go. I call this &quot;growing stronger&quot;. Understanding the semantic distinction between &quot;growing bigger&quot; and growing stronger&quot; seems to me crucial when discussing the &quot;(movement) growth&quot; of effective altruism&quot;.</p>\n<p><strong>Research Into Social Movements</strong>\nOver the last year, I've observed multiple individuals independent of the Centre for Effective Altruism suggesting how social movements have historically grown and succeeded be studied so effective altruism can learn how successfully it could replicate such methods. However, I've noticed a dearth of updates or coordination on such a project. More than researching myself, I'd be reaching out to the community to note and report on who what others have learned thus far.</p>\n<p><strong>Blogging Carnival: Role Models</strong>\nI'm going to propose the monthly topic for the effective altruism blogging carnival for February be &quot;Role Models&quot;. If this doesn't come to pass, though, I want to write about it anyway. It's a topic which excites me, so I'm willing to take suggestions for (co-)authoring a profile on an individual who has lived and acted in the spirit of effective altruism in the past or present, if not affiliated with the movement.</p>\n<p><strong>What Different Types of Organizations Can Do</strong>\nAt the 2014 Effective Altruism Summit, I met multiple entrepreneurs who suggested start-ups and for-profit efforts can produce through their goods or services provide an efficient mechanism for positive social impact in addition to the money to be donated that they generate for their owners or employees. Since then, I've noticed this idea popping up more. Of course, start-ups contrast with bigger corporations. Additionally, I believe there are different types of non-profit organizations, and their differences are important. Charities doing direct work (e.g., the Against Malaria Foundation), foundations (e.g., Good Ventures, Charity Science), research think tanks (e.g., Givewell, the Centre for Effective Altruism), advocacy and awareness organizations (e.g., The Life You Can Save, Greenpeace), scientific research projects (e.g. the International Panel on Climate Change), and political advocacy (Avaaz.org, Amnesty International) are all different.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>To lump all &quot;for-profit&quot; types of work, and all &quot;non-profit&quot; types of work into two categories underrates the advantages and disadvantages of how to structure an organization driven toward a goal.</li>\n<li>Different types of organizations differ across nations and law codes, the cultures and traditions of their respective sectors, and their structural limitations. Effective altruism should be aware of such so it can figure out how best effectively achieve goals for a given cause.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Building Relationships With Charities</strong>\nWithin effective altruism, there are individuals who have succeeded in earning high enough income that they can and do donate (tens of thousands) of dollars to a single charity each year. The focus of donations within of effective altruism is on charities which the community believes are working in neglected cause areas, so those charities may be smaller than more common ones (such as UNICEF or Greenpeace), and accustomed to such large donations. Owners and investors into companies maintain relationships with executives to check how well they're operating those companies. However, while donations to a charity may be analogous to a profit-seeking investment, the relationship between a (large) donor and a charity may be quite different. Effective altruism is unique in that single large donors tend to care about the transparency and technical details of charities they support more than philanthropists and donors not influenced by effective altruism. So, maintaining a mutually respectful and courteous relationship may be more different and tenuous than average. It seems a guide for those earning to give, and who build relationships with charities over time, could be useful. I don't consider myself remotely qualified to write this guide on my own, so I'll be seeking coauthors or reviewers extensively.</p>\n<p><strong>Building Relationships With Donors and Fundraisers</strong>\nThere are supporters of effective altruism starting and managing unconventional non-profit organizations. I wouldn't be surprised if more of them do so in the coming years. Their financial and moral supporters may or may not be familiar with effective altruism, and non-profits that try to optimize for effectiveness. This guide would be an inverse to the one above, about how to maintain effective relationships with donors, both in general, and specifically about charities aiming to be more effective. This guide would be intended for maintaining relationships with ongoing donors, in particular ones who are concerned with and constructively critical of how a non-profit is run. How to effectively court new donors, or run successful fundraisers, seems like a separate guide. Thirdly, as they grow, non-profits aligned with effective altruism may form relationships with other organizations that boost their profile or raise funds on their behalf. How to effectively manage relations with them also seems important. Again, these are all topics on which I consider myself unqualified to write guides about, but I think are important enough for me to facilitate. So, I'll be seeking coauthors, reviewers, and experienced supporters extensively.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Evan_Gaensbauer"}}, {"_id": "92KYkay5rspJjqR94", "postedAt": "2015-01-25T23:35:47.863Z", "postId": "YLwHcFFrc4brRCKNz", "htmlBody": "<p>Good suggestions. </p>\n<p>I think you'll have more luck getting social movement research into the public domain by approaching people individually.
