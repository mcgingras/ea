Jacy's book is quite good. I would describe his as focused on clean and plant-based meat. His work was very helpful for my chapter on clean meat.

I think you make a good point. I read \"The Good It Promises\" and I think there are some helpful chapters, but it has a number of essays not really about farm animals. &nbsp;And as Lorenzo notes there are many other books that discuss EA and farm animals. I thought The End of Animal Farming was good and cite it in my book. I just thought a good survey of EA and farm animals would be helpful for folks.
