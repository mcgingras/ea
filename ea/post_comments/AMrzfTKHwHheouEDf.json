More importantly, I think this is a totally separate question to whether to sell Wytham,and requires different arguments. Eg I gather that CEEALAR has several times been considered and passed over for funding before, I don't have a ton of context for why, but that suggests to me it's not a slam dunk re being a better use of money.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Neel Nanda"}}, {"_id": "9nCByj5kDaKEjHyzA", "postedAt": "2024-01-26T12:54:38.361Z", "postId": "AMrzfTKHwHheouEDf", "htmlBody": "<p>I personally feel strongly about CEEALAR being better value, but that's just one of the many organisations listed - you can mentally delete it if your mileage varies.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, for better or worse, the mansion now belongs to EVF, so it's now up to EVF to decide whether it's the most effective path for them to keep it.
