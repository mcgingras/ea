I don't necessarily still endorse my conclusions here, and I'm not planning to respond to comments, sorry!]</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>One tiny, tiny upside of the FTX crisis: I had interesting new thoughts!</strong></p><p>A problem with EA having a few big funders:</p><ul><li>The common argument I\u2019d heard against billionaires funding EA was that these billionaires' biases would affect how funding was spent. E.g. Dustin Muskovitz would push OpenPhil to spend money to prevent Big Tech regulation.</li><li>I\u2019m not very convinced here: EAs as a group aspire to cause neutrality and finding the most effective ways of doing good, and seem to have a strong awareness of how personal biases can affect this.</li><li>Anecdotally, Dustin doesn\u2019t have much of a role in deciding what OpenPhil spends its money on. See <strong>this tweet</strong>&nbsp;showing he didn\u2019t know it was OpenPhil who paid for the \u00a310 million Wytham Abbey. [Edit: can't find the tweet link, sorry!]</li><li>However, the FTX crisis convinced me of a related argument.</li><li>EA funding coming from a specific billionaire gives the EA community a stake in whatever organisation, industry or system that billionaire\u2019s wealth is tied up in.</li><li>For example, I\u2019m somewhat invested in the success of Asana because of the significant portion of Dustin Muskovitz\u2019 wealth being tied up in that.</li><li>Extrapolating a little, a wealthy EA has more to lose, and our dreams of what we could do with that wealth and plain old loss-aversion can subtly push every EA towards supporting whatever that predicted wealth depends upon. This can be anything from a specific product to Silicon Valley to the capitalist economic system.</li><li>The severity of this depends on the structure of the billionaire in question. Bill Gates\u2019 wealth is <strong>mainly in the stock market</strong>, not in Microsoft, so the effect is less strong. (though it still could tie people to the stock market doing well)</li><li>Sometimes you might think it worth it to support a specific product because EA causes would get much more funding if it prospers. However, sometimes it definitely isn\u2019t.</li><li>Be explicit with yourself about why you have a positive opinion of an organisation or Silicon Valley. Don\u2019t let your positive feelings about the money something brings to EA cloud your opinion in the whole of it.</li><li>Potential EAs or EA collaborators could legitimately be turned off of EA if they experience it as full of Silicon Valley devotees, blind to that place\u2019s faults.</li><li>To the extent you value truth-seeking as a core value of EA, this also damages that.</li><li>My overall takeaway boils down to the common rationalist message: know why you believe what you believe.</li><li>I\u2019m not arguing against EA allying with billionaire donors in this post, the amount of money they could contribute to high-impact causes outweighs this in my opinion.</li><li>However, I think we as a community should be more aware of the subtle impacts of billionaire funding. Don\u2019t blind yourself to the flaws of a company, culture or economic system because it currently benefits EA. Make clear to yourself what you think about EA funding sources, and most importantly, remember positive impact (and whatever intangible values you also believe in!) are what ultimately matter.</li></ul><p><strong>Smaller thoughts:</strong></p><p>Posts about EA funding should be more clear that this is only a prediction, and explain various other possibilities to decrease the possibility that people grow too attached to the big number.</p><ul><li>I think Ben Todd\u2019s post about EA having 50 billion made people grow attached to EA having lots of money - when it was nothing but pledged donations that don\u2019t really exist!</li><li>I know EAs who made decisions based on the large amount of money pledged to EA and I suspect some of them didn\u2019t give much thought to alternative worlds.</li><li>My suggestions for framing future EA funding situations: &nbsp;<ul><li>Explain various other scenarios, as they might not be apparent to casual readers. (People also vary in how they think, I\u2019m someone for whom writing really helps me think, so by just reading about something I don\u2019t necessarily critique it enough\u2026)</li><li>Frame it as: \u2018this is one possible world\u2019, rather than \u2018we have this money!\u2019 because losing money feels very bad.</li></ul></li></ul><p>EA needs more people with experience, this is a strike against talented young people</p><ul><li>Newspaper articles have drawn attention to the sheer\u2026 incompetence of Alameda and FTX. No accounting department? Let alone \u2018losing\u2019 eight billion.</li><li>A meme I\u2019ve seen in EA is young people can do anything if we\u2019re talented and ambitious enough. I\u2019m all for aiming high, but the FTX crisis has made me update towards the need for more professional experience in EA.</li><li>If an EA organisation runs like a company then it should learn from the business world that\u2019s had decades to perfect marketing, operations, recruiting etc.</li><li>This might look like young EAs going into the business world to learn these skills, EA organisations hiring aligned business professionals. I think there should also be more thought as to the importance of EA-alignment in each role in an EA org.</li><li>This might already exist in word of mouth form that hasn\u2019t reached me.</li></ul><p>Something about the reaction and its effects on me:</p><ul><li>The FTX crisis produced emotional effects that scared me.</li><li>It cost me focus and sleep, almost like a tiny breakup.</li><li>It took more than a week for me to feel okay again.</li><li>I read everything I could find on the EA forum and in my Twitter circles.</li><li>This was really scary. I\u2019d never experienced anything like this before.</li><li>But, hearing from other people experiencing similar effects made me feel much less scared. I didn\u2019t know this was a thing that could happen and felt like something was wrong with me.</li><li>I now understand when my university sends out support messages when bad things happen in the world.</li><li>Overall, the crisis opened me to a new part of human experience.</li></ul><p>80,000 Hours portrays interviewees in a positive light:</p><ul><li>One strong feeling I had after the FTX crisis was that \u2018But the 80k podcast gave a really positive view of him\u2019</li><li>In hindsight, this is something 80k does to all its guests.</li><li>Anecdotally, I\u2019ve heard lots of people strongly disagree with Ian Morris\u2019 ideas in this episode, but the impression I got from the episode is that \u2018this is true and really cool\u2019</li><li>80k could challenge guests a little on the show, ask for the strongest counterarguments to some of their ideas, or issue a disclaimer saying they don\u2019t necessarily wholeheartedly support whoever they host on their podcast.</li><li>However, challenging people might make guests more hesitant to come on the show.</li><li>I think there should be more community awareness that Rob Wiblin portraying someone as super cool on 80k doesn\u2019t mean they are fully vetted and supported by the EA community.<ul><li>I think a blog post making clear 80k\u2019s general view towards guests would help, and I also think this should be passed along by word of mouth.</li></ul></li></ul>", "user": {"username": "Marzhin"}}, {"_id": "Rbk8ky4LQschdHdby", "title": "How people stopped dying from diarrhea so much (& other life-saving decisions)", "postedAt": "2024-03-16T16:00:47.803Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://youtu.be/ll9myMeFU3g\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ll9myMeFU3g\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><p><i>Rational Animations made this video collaborating with 80,000 Hours.

I have included the full script below.</i></p><hr><p>It\u2019s easy to feel like one person can\u2019t make a difference.</p><p>The problems the world faces seem so vast, and we seem so small.&nbsp;Sometimes even the best of intentions aren't enough to make the world budge.</p><p>Now, it\u2019s&nbsp;<i>true</i> that many common ways people try to do good have less impact than you might think at first.</p><p>But&nbsp;<i>some</i> ways of doing good have allowed certain people to achieve an&nbsp;<i>extraordinary</i> impact. How is this possible? And what does it mean for how&nbsp;<i>you</i> can make a difference?</p><p>We\u2019ll start by looking at doctors \u2014 and end up at&nbsp;<i>nuclear war</i>.</p><p>Many people train to become doctors because they want to save lives! And, of course, their work is very important. But how many lives does a doctor really save over the course of their career? You might assume it's in the hundreds or thousands. But the surprising truth is that, according to <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/how-many-lives-does-a-doctor-save-part-1/\">an analysis carried by Dr Greg Lewis</a> \u2014 a former medical doctor \u2014&nbsp; the number is far lower than you'd expect.</p><p>Since the 19th century, life expectancy has skyrocketed. But that\u2019s not just because of medicine. There are loads of contributing factors, like nutrition, improved sanitation, and increased wealth. Estimating how many years of life&nbsp;<i>medicine alone</i> saves is really difficult.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite this difficulty, <a href=\"https://www.milbank.org/wp-content/uploads/mq/volume-72/issue-02/72-2-Improving-Health-Measuring-Effects-of-Medical-Care.pdf\">one attempt</a> \u2014 from researchers at Harvard and King\u2019s College London \u2014 found that medical care in developed countries increases the life expectancy of each person in these countries by around 5 years.</p><p>Most developed countries have around 3 doctors per 1,000 people. So, if this estimate is right, each doctor saves around 1,666 years of life, over the course of their career. Using the World Bank\u2019s standard conversion rate of 30 extra years of healthy life to one \u201clife saved,\u201d that\u2019s around about 50 lives saved per doctor!</p><p>But that\u2019s actually a substantial overestimate.</p><p>Doctors are only one part of the medical system, which also relies on nurses and hospital staff, as well as overhead and equipment. And more importantly, there are already a lot of doctors in the developed world. So if you don\u2019t become a doctor, someone else will be available to perform the&nbsp;<i>most</i> critical procedures.&nbsp;<i>Additional</i> doctors only allow society to carry out&nbsp;<i>additional</i>, usually less significant, procedures.</p><p>Look at this graph, from the analysis by Dr. Greg Lewis we quoted earlier. Each point is a country \u2014 The vertical axis shows disability-adjusted-life-years per 100-thousand people. You can think of that figure as roughly how many years of disability a group of 100-thousand people has to endure on average. Therefore, the fewer, the better. Each country has a different figure. The horizontal axis shows the number of doctors per 100-thousand people in each country. As you can see, countries with more doctors suffer lower disability.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rbk8ky4LQschdHdby/wamb9alqshj95goiuir6\">But notice how the curve goes nearly flat once you have more than 150 doctors per 100-thousand people. After this point (which almost all developed countries meet), additional doctors only achieve a small impact on average.&nbsp;In fact, at 300 doctors per 100-thousand people, an additional doctor saves only around 200 years of life throughout their career.</p><p>So, when you take all this into account, including some accounting for the impact of nurses and other parts of the medical system, it looks more like each doctor saves only around 3 lives through the course of their career. Still an admirable achievement, but perhaps less than you may imagine.</p><p>But that\u2019s an&nbsp;<i>ordinary</i> doctor. Some doctors have had&nbsp;<i>much</i> more impact than this.</p><p>By 1968, we knew how to prevent deaths from cholera. The main cause of death was dehydration due to bad diarrhoea. The treatment for this was relatively cheap: just salt and glucose, dissolved into water. But millions of people were still dying every year.</p><p>The problem was that this salt and glucose solution needed to be administered by a feeding tube, or an intravenous drip \u2014 straight into the bloodstream. Delivering this kind of treatment is far from simple, which meant that many cholera victims died from extreme dehydration before they could even reach medical care.</p><p>Enter Dr. David Nalin. He was an American doctor sent to work at a refugee camp, just on the border of Bangladesh and Myanmar.</p><p>In a groundbreaking study, Dr. Nalin showed if everything was dissolved at the right concentration, and consumed at the right rate, just&nbsp;<i>drinking</i> a solution of salt and glucose could rehydrate cholera patients pretty much as effectively as IV fluids. This meant the treatment could be used anywhere, even remote villages, and using only extremely cheap and widely available ingredients.</p><p>Since then, this astonishingly simple treatment has been used all over the world, and the annual rate of child deaths from diarrhoea has plummeted from around 5 million to 1.5 million.</p><p>If Dr Nalin had not been around, someone else would probably have discovered this treatment eventually. However, even if we imagine that he sped up the roll-out by only five months, his work alone would have saved about 500,000 lives. This is a very approximate estimate, but it makes his impact more than 100,000 times greater than that of an ordinary doctor:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rbk8ky4LQschdHdby/hhylifmacmob7llwkj8a\"></p><p>And even just within medical research, Dr Nalin is far from the most extreme example of a high-impact career.</p><p>Take blood transfusions. Today, they\u2019re a routine, lifesaving procedure. But over a century ago, transfusions were risky endeavours that often ended in death. At the dawn of the 20th century, doctors simply didn't understand why some blood transfusions worked while others were fatal. Lives were being lost and medicine was stumped.</p><p>That all changed thanks to the work of Austrian biologist Karl Landsteiner. In 1901, after years of meticulous laboratory research, Landsteiner identified three blood groups: A, B, and O (although, shockingly, he called \u201cO\u201d \u201cC\u201d). This groundbreaking discovery unlocked the mystery behind the deaths caused by early blood transfusions.</p><p>Landsteiner found that transfusions with incompatible blood types often led to potentially fatal outcomes. But when blood types matched between donor and patient, transfusions were safe and effective.</p><p>With this knowledge, doctors could begin matching donor and patient blood types for the first time. Landsteiner's insights allowed blood transfusions to save lives instead of endangering them. It was a pivotal advancement in medicine.</p><p>The value of Landsteiner's research became abundantly clear during the First World War. Setting up blood banks near field hospitals allowed for rapid access to typed blood to treat wounded soldiers. Transfusions went from risky last resorts to standard life-saving procedures over the course of the war.</p><p>In the decades since, Landsteiner's system has enabled millions of successful blood transfusions. Patients with blood loss from trauma or surgery, those undergoing cancer treatment, and many more have benefitted. The analysis by Greg Lewis puts Karl Landsteiner\u2019s discovery of blood groups as saving tens of millions of lives.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rbk8ky4LQschdHdby/apvolxkwaudnsghe4wat\">This is a very uncertain estimate. It could easily be off by a factor of 10 or more, and seems more likely to be too high than too low. It's possible that speeding up the discovery wouldn't have had much impact at all \u2014 most of the lives saved were in the modern era, when people were rapidly gaining access to other medical advancements which could save their lives, or prevent the need for transfusions completely. On the other hand, the discovery of blood groups probably made other scientific advances possible, and we're ignoring their impact. Nevertheless, the basic point stands: Landsteiner's impact was likely&nbsp;<i>vastly</i> greater than even David Nalin\u2019s.</p><p>There are also many more examples you don\u2019t hear about, like Viktor Zhdanov. In the 20th century, smallpox killed around 400 million people \u2014 far more than died in all the century\u2019s wars and political famines. Zhdanov single-handedly lobbied the World Health Organization to start a campaign which eventually led to the complete elimination of smallpox. Without his involvement, smallpox would not have been eliminated until much later, and possibly not at all.</p><p>But who saved the&nbsp;<i>most</i> lives in history?</p><p>One top candidate is Stanislav Petrov, a little-known Soviet Lieutenant Colonel who may have saved&nbsp;<i>your</i> life.</p><p>It was just another late night shift for Stanislav Petrov in the secret Serpukhov-15 bunker outside Moscow. As a duty officer, he settled into the commander's chair to monitor the Soviet Union's early-warning satellites over the United States. Little did he know this routine shift was about to thrust him into one of the most harrowing incidents of the Cold War.</p><p>Petrov\u2019s instructions were clear: if the United States launched nuclear missiles, he was to report that immediately to his superiors, who had a policy of striking back, immediately, with their own nuclear weapons.</p><p>Shortly after midnight, the screens showed five ICBMs launched from the United States, heading towards the Soviet Union.</p><p>For five excruciating minutes, he turned over the evidence again and again in his mind.</p><p>Petrov reasoned that, if the US were starting a nuclear war, they\u2019d probably launch hundreds of missiles, not just five. So he reported it as a false alarm. And he was right \u2014 no missiles had in fact been launched. The world was safe, at least for now.</p><p>If Petrov&nbsp;<i>had</i> triggered a strike, it\u2019s possible that someone else could have called off the launch process. But there\u2019s at least a reasonable chance that the Soviet Union would have retaliated, and hundreds of millions would have died. The two countries may have even ended up engaged in an all-out nuclear war, leading to billions of deaths.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Rbk8ky4LQschdHdby/jcgd8g9pajmkg3z7r6p2\">And Petrov's decision may have done much more than \"just\" save a billion people from nuclear catastrophe. As we saw in our video on longtermism, focusing on potential risks to the long-term future can be even more high-impact than saving lives today. The nuclear war that Petrov prevented could have devastated scientific, artistic, economic, and all other forms of progress, and possibly even lead to the end of civilisation itself. Every human who will live in the future will be alive, in part, because of Petrov.</p><p>So we\u2019ve seen people\u2019s careers have had huge positive effects, some&nbsp;<i>vastly</i> more than others.</p><p>A large component is luck \u2014 Nalin, Landsteiner, and Petrov were in the right place at the right time. You can\u2019t guarantee you\u2019ll make an important medical discovery.</p><p>But it wasn\u2019t&nbsp;<i>all</i> luck: Landsteiner and Nalin chose to use their medical knowledge to solve some of the most devastating health problems of their day. And it was somewhat foreseeable that someone high up in the military of a nuclear power could have the opportunity to prevent nuclear conflict.</p><p>What does this mean for you?</p><p>People often wonder how they can \u201cmake a difference,\u201d but if some careers can result in thousands of times more impact than others, this isn\u2019t the right question. Two different career options can both \u201cmake a difference,\u201d but one could be dramatically better than the other.</p><p>Instead, the key question is: What are some of the&nbsp;<i>best</i> ways to make a difference? In other words, what can you do to give yourself a chance of having one of the highest-impact careers?</p><p>This video was adapted from part of the new 80,000 Hours Career Guide \u2014 which attempts to answer exactly that question.&nbsp;</p><p>The guide covers everything you need to know about how to find a fulfilling career that does good, from why you shouldn\u2019t just \u201cfollow your passion\u201d, to why medicine and charity work aren\u2019t always the best way to help others.</p><p>It\u2019s full of practical tips and exercises, and at the end, you\u2019ll have a draft of your new career plan.</p><p>Just go to <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/rational \">80000hours.org/rational</a> to find out more.</p><p>We all want to make a difference. If you think carefully about how, the best ways to help others could end up doing a lot more good than you\u2019d ever think possible. Identify society's most pressing problems, develop expertise to address them, and who knows?

In particular:</p><ol><li><strong>Avoid casually sharing low-quality criticism</strong>,<strong>&nbsp;</strong>at least without explaining why it might be relevant or useful (including to dunk on it, express outrage/incredulity, etc.).<ol><li>People or groups who are being criticized a lot sometimes joke around about recent low-quality criticism (I do this, too), but I think this often encourages a dismissive/condescending or tribal mindset towards a pretty broad set of criticisms.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Limit your own engagement with low-quality criticism.</strong><ol><li>Maybe view low-quality criticism as basically spam; block people on social media if they share it a lot, remind yourself that this is probably a waste of time/energy, resist the urge to read the dramatic criticism (resist the FOMO?), etc. Consider giving yourself a regular quota of time to spend on this kind of criticism, if you tend to get sucked in (and maybe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeboxing\">timebox</a>&nbsp;engagement with specific criticisms).</li></ol></li><li><strong>Remind people (and yourself) that it\u2019s ok to not respond to every criticism.</strong><ol><li>(And support them if they feel pressured to respond.)</li></ol></li><li><strong>Actively seek out, share, and celebrate good criticism.</strong><ol><li>Relatedly, help improve the average quality of criticism that people hear, e.g. by helping (good-faith) critics with their work. One way to do this is to be more legible; criticism will be better if people know more about the thing they\u2019re criticizing, so they\u2019re criticizing the right thing.</li><li>Also relatedly, consider \u201ctranslating\u201d good or potentially-important points from bad criticisms into a form that\u2019s easier for people to engage with. E.g. if there\u2019s a new polemic that makes a bunch of poor arguments or random accusations that<i>&nbsp;also </i>includes some interesting points, consider summarizing and sharing those.</li></ol></li></ol><p>Other suggestions (not related to limiting engagement):</p><ol><li>Notice these phenomena and try to train yourself to notice if e.g. you\u2019re allowing yourself to lump all criticisms on a certain topic into one pile (in a way you don\u2019t endorse).</li><li>Share more <i>positive</i>&nbsp;feedback.</li><li data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref3\">We could try to address each of the issues I listed separately, e.g. by learning to correct somewhat misguided criticisms until they\u2019re more useful, trying to steelman criticisms<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"3\" data-footnote-id=\"fuk6n5ad70l\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffuk6n5ad70l\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfuk6n5ad70l\">[3]</a></sup></span>, etc..

I am uncertain about the effectiveness of engaging with smaller and middle powers' AI policies compared to other options, believe we haven't fully explored these paths for impact, and welcome perspectives on their feasibility.</p><p>This list is only based on my personal work experience working in the government of a middle power, armchair reasoning about why middle powers might matter, and a rusty understanding of diplomacy picked up in university a few years ago.</p><h2><strong>Intro</strong></h2><p>On this forum, there is often a focus on AI governance. Debates often (rightly) focus on the actions of the (AI) superpowers like the US and China. These countries, with their substantial AI industries,&nbsp;and technological resources, are usually at the forefront&nbsp;of discussions about global AI Governance.&nbsp;However, this does not necessarily make engaging with these countries the only path to impact. This post explores potential leverage middle powers could use to address AI governance challenges effectively.</p><p>I am currently not sure whether getting new people to engage actively with the policies of smaller and middle powers will be effective compared to other options they might have. But I also think that as a community we have not investigated these paths to impact as thoroughly as I think we should, and I am fairly confident that for people that are in a position where they can have a positive impact on these powers, it might be worthwhile to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>I also think I might be biased towards thinking that middle powers might matter for AI governance, as this is what I am currently working on, so I am eager to hear pushback on whether these paths seem feasible.</p><h2><strong>Research Funding</strong></h2><p>One critical area where middle powers can make a significant impact is research funding, especially concerning AI safety. The current investment in AI governance research and safety research is negligible. Middle powers could shift this balance by funding research that advances AI safety, including technical safety work, interoperability, system robustness, and alignment research.</p><p>Since there are probably high costs associated with catching up in conventional AI safety research, middle powers might explore specialized funding strategies: These could focus on providing global public goods in AI safety not currently addressed by any single actor, such as incident data&nbsp;gathering, external monitoring of AI labs, auditing systems&nbsp;or&nbsp;improving AI&nbsp;Forecasting.</p><h3>Questions I have about Research funding</h3><ul><li>How can middle powers effectively allocate research funding to maximize their impact on AI safety?</li><li>Is there a significant constraint on money or on talent? If talent is the problem, how well can more funding be converted into talent?</li><li>What specialized funding strategies can middle powers adapt to support global public goods in AI safety that are not currently addressed by major governments or labs?</li></ul><h2><strong>Leveraging AI Inputs</strong></h2><p>Another area of potential influence is the AI supply chain. The computational power necessary to train AI systems has a fairly concentrated supply chain, which passes through several middle powers that might have significant leverage over access to compute resources. I'm thinking in particular of South Korea, Japan, Taiwan,&nbsp;and the Netherlands, but there might be others in this category.</p><p>For these countries, it might be feasible to have a pretty significant impact on who can develop future AI systems through export restrictions or other regulations that limit what actors companies are allowed to give access to (the input needed for) developing state of the art compute necessary for AI. Potentially other inputs of AI, such as the necessary talent or data, might also be susceptible to these kinds&nbsp;of restrictions.</p><h3>Questions I have about AI inputs</h3><ul><li>What specific export restrictions or regulations could middle powers implement to control access to critical AI inputs like compute resources, talent, and data?</li><li>Will the above-mentioned middle countries maintain enough independent control of their industries to implement these kinds of policies?</li><li>Apart from compute, are there any other inputs of AI that might potentially be restricted? And if so, who has the capability to restrict them?</li></ul><h2><strong>Multilateral Institutions and Relations</strong></h2><p>Middle powers can also play a significant role in shaping the future of AI through active participation in regional institutions and international organizations, such as the EU, UN or OECD. By influencing international regulations and standards, these countries can contribute to global discussions on AI governance.</p><p>The EU is on track to pass its own AI legislation. Middle powers that are part of the EU might influence decision-making in the EU through the positions their country takes in the Council of the EU. Similarly, we might see other regional bodies play a role in the governance of AI as well. On the global stage, the UN and OECD have both already played a role in the governance of AI, with the OECD playing a major role in standard setting and the creation of definitions, and the UN starting the process of getting to a global institution that might regulate through soft law. AI Governance is currently being explored by the UN High-Level Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence, which includes pretty wide representation from a large range of different countries. While such wider participation might sound democratic and positive, it might also lead to a proposal that is way too ambitious to get the superpowers on board.&nbsp;This shows the downsides&nbsp;participation of a lot of middle powers might have on AI governance and its feasibility.</p><p>Another example of this is the participation of middle powers in summits like the AI (Safety) Summits. And the list of invitees of this conference is already a pretty good reflection of what middle powers might be influential, since it's my understanding that the countries were selected based on whether they will have an influence on the future development of AI.</p><h3>Questions I have about Multilateral Institutions and Relations</h3><ul><li>How can middle powers enhance their influence in multilateral institutions to promote global AI governance frameworks?</li><li>What mechanisms within multilateral institutions are most effective for smaller nations to introduce or influence AI governance and safety standards?</li><li>Can a coalition of middle powers within multilateral institutions like the UN or OECD effectively counterbalance the influence of AI superpowers in shaping AI governance norms? Should they?</li><li>How can middle powers ensure their interests and perspectives on AI risk and governance are adequately represented in multilateral discussions?</li></ul><h2><strong>Bilateral Relations</strong></h2><p>Another path through which these powers could be influential in shaping AI governance is through bilateral relationships with the bigger players. I'm thinking here in particular of the US and China. Whereas it seems unlikely that middle powers will be able to shape the policy decisions made in Washington or Beijing, it seems like they could be influential on the margin in the decision-making of these superpowers. Through nudging their policy in slightly more safety-minded directions in negotiations and whenever they are consulted, they could have a positive influence as well.</p><p>Additionally, middle powers might be able to provide \"neutral ground\" for diplomacy to occur between the AI superpowers, playing an enabling role in coming to some sort of international agreement.</p><h3>Questions about Bilateral relations</h3><ul><li>What strategies can middle powers employ in bilateral relations to nudge superpowers towards safer AI development practices?</li><li>Can bilateral agreements between middle powers and AI superpowers include provisions that positively influence AI safety and governance?</li><li>Can middle powers leverage their strategic or economic relationships with superpowers to gain concessions or influence in the realm of AI development and governance?</li><li>What are the risks and potential downsides of middle powers engaging in bilateral negotiations with superpowers on AI governance?</li></ul><h2><strong>Creating Incentives Through National Regulations</strong></h2><p>Middle powers, through passing new AI legislation, have the opportunity to set precedents that could motivate AI labs to adhere to higher standards of safety, interpretability, and robustness. By enacting laws that demand stringent compliance for market access, these nations could indirectly influence global AI practices. The key lies in designing regulations that are reasonable enough for AI developers to achieve compliance, while also setting a standard that meaningfully contributes to reducing global AI risk. If executed in a synchronized manner among middle powers, this approach could set a new norm of enhanced safety standards in AI development, provided the regulations are targeted effectively and there is genuine incentive for labs to comply. Alternatively, middle powers might experiment with new policies that then spread through policy diffusion.</p><h3 data-internal-id=\"Questions_about_National_Regulations_and_incentives_\">Questions about National Regulations and incentives</h3><ul><li>How can middle powers design national laws and regulations to set a high benchmark for AI safety, interpretability, and ethical standards?</li><li>What strategies can middle powers employ to prevent the displacement of unsafe AI development practices to less regulated environments?</li><li>Is there potential for a coalition of middle powers to harmonize their AI regulations, thus establishing a global baseline for AI safety and governance standards? (Under what circumstances) would this be helpful?</li></ul><ol class=\"footnote-section footnotes\" data-footnote-section=\"\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"zdkmfaqmkm8\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnzdkmfaqmkm8\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"zdkmfaqmkm8\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefzdkmfaqmkm8\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>&nbsp;Wikipedia lists the following countries as middle powers, which also seems roughly accurate to me: Algeria, Egypt, Ethiopia, Kenya, Nigeria, South Africa, Argentina, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, Peru, North Korea, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Kazakhstan, Kuwait, Malaysia, Pakistan, Philippines, Qatar, South Korea, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, Vietnam, Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Ukraine, Australia, New Zealand</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "EffectiveAdvocate"}}, {"_id": "rkTQ6AZcoZCqiLewz", "title": "Rational Animations offers animation production and writing services!", "postedAt": "2024-03-15T17:26:08.008Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "Writer"}}, {"_id": "MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw", "title": "Maternal Health Initiative is Shutting Down", "postedAt": "2024-03-15T17:19:38.374Z", "htmlBody": "<p><a href=\"https://maternalhealthinitiative.org/\"><i><u>Maternal Health Initiative</u></i></a><i> (MHI) was founded out of Charity Entrepreneurship (AIM)\u2019s 2022 Incubation Program and has since piloted two interventions integrating postpartum (post-birth) contraceptive counselling into routine care appointments in Ghana.

In 2017, almost 300,000 women and girls died due to either pregnancy or childbirth (<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/maternal-mortality\"><u>WHO, 2017</u></a>). Cleland et al. (<a href=\"http://depts.washington.edu/sphnet/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/Cleland.pdf\"><u>2006</u></a>) estimate that comprehensive access to contraception could avert more than 30% of maternal deaths and 10% of child mortality globally.&nbsp;</p><p>Contraceptive access provides a wide range of other potential benefits, the most significant of which may be increasing reproductive autonomy for women who want to space or limit births and currently have limited options for doing so.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Why postpartum (post-birth)?</h3><p>Postpartum family planning (PPFP) \u2013 that is, integrating family planning guidance into postnatal care and/or child immunisation appointments\u2013 has been identified as an effective way of increasing contraceptive uptake and reducing unmet need (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32904608/\"><u>Wayessa et al.

(2016</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>The maternal and infant mortality risks from short birth spacing make the postpartum period a potential point of particular value from increased contraceptive access. Demographic Health Survey (DHS) analysis suggests an 18% increase in neonatal mortality, 21% increase in child mortality, and 32% increase in mortality risk from births that occur within two years of a prior pregnancy (Kozuki and Walker\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24564713/\"><u>2013</u></a>; Conde-Agudelo et al.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17403398/\"><u>2007</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>While it is often an official policy that family planning counselling should be included in postnatal care (Ghana Health Service,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://platform.who.int/docs/default-source/mca-documents/policy-documents/policy/gha-cc-10-01-policy-2014-eng-national-reproductive-health-service-policy-and-standards.pdf\"><u>2014</u></a>), the consistency and quality of family planning services in the postpartum period vary in practice (<a href=\"https://obgyn.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ijgo.12216\"><u>Morhe et al. 2017</u></a>).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>MHI: An overview of our work</strong></h2><p>Charity Entrepreneurship (<a href=\"https://www.ambitiousimpact.com/\"><u>AIM</u></a>) recommended postpartum family planning as part of the 2022 Incubation Program through which MHI was founded. As such, MHI has had an explicit focus on postpartum family planning work since its beginning. We spent our first few months interviewing a few dozen experts, getting up to speed with research in the field, and selecting priority target countries. Based on this work, we visited Sierra Leone and Ghana in January and February 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>We struggled to find a viable partner organisation in Sierra Leone and our initial meeting with the national government there suggested lower enthusiasm for the kind of work we were proposing. However, our time in Ghana was more promising and we chose to launch pilot work in Northern Ghana with two local organisations -&nbsp;<a href=\"https://norsaac.org/\"><u>Norsaac</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://savsign.org/\"><u>Savana Signatures</u></a>.</p><p>Once our partnerships were in place, we began conducting baseline surveys and interviews with both healthcare providers and recipients to better understand family planning services and barriers to access in Ghana.</p><p>Building on this information, we ran an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://maternalhealthinitiative.org/our-work/proof-of-concept/\"><u>initial proof of concept training sessions</u></a> in April 2023 with around 25 nurses and midwives. One-month follow-up surveying suggested that while providers had a strong knowledge of family planning post-training, implementation of counselling was inconsistent.</p><p>This information led us to redesign our intervention approaches in the summer of 2023, shifting from training providers on family planning knowledge and counselling best practices to training them in one of two specific, structured counselling models.&nbsp;</p><p>Through the second half of 2023, MHI\u2019s efforts focused on refining and then evaluating these two models. We began by conducting a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://maternalhealthinitiative.org/our-work/mini-pilot/\"><u>second proof of concept project</u></a> with Savana Signatures at six hospitals in the Northern and Savannah Regions to test and refine the new intervention models. With this knowledge, we then launched a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://maternalhealthinitiative.org/our-work/pilot/\"><u>formal pilot project</u></a> from September to December 2023 across six hospitals in Ghana\u2019s Northern Region. Since its conclusion, MHI has focused on data analysis and investigation of the uncertainties around impact that have ultimately led us to the choice to shut down.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/nuajqlegwmwdvvymofny\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/e8d43q1naweows1wljd0 110w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/qzwt5bk6mg2uo5y3hecl 220w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/enpythp975mzdl8fqjli 330w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/cgefwnxhkbmuyhnecw5s 440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/cz3nlcdbvf8uluo7nxoz 550w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/qloll10jpzmnauhj5rqk 660w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/dbpimrrlv3bsadjtgaph 770w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/nfdwfnprf4xoj0gfswr2 880w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/i9u0wgmvbla0yuub9lry 990w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/hflzt42rqbrybo8q2pgb 1008w\"><figcaption><i>&nbsp;Healthcare workers gathered after attending our first training session in April 2023</i></figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Pilot: Design</strong></h2><p>MHI\u2019s pilot programme was based on two specific intervention models, with counselling materials designed by MHI to support providers in implementing this counselling.

provisional&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/189oyl7aOwNvRs_3r6JwEiZxqROtDt984ffY2sKQfAi4/edit#gid=1119696722\"><u>cost-effectiveness analysis</u></a>, we were aiming for a shift in contraceptive uptake of around 10% from our pilot program. Neither of MHI\u2019s pilot interventions approached this level based on the immediate surveying. The 2-week follow-up data for PNC suggests a much larger shift in contraceptive uptake, though we have concerns about the reliability of this data.&nbsp;</p><p>Put together, these results suggest a few conclusions. First, we can say with relative confidence that the CWC intervention did not work as hoped. Implementation was poorer but sufficient to expect reliable results, and we found no meaningful change in contraceptive uptake. Second, we can conclude that the effectiveness of the PNC intervention is hard to determine. We have conflicting surveying data, suggesting both a relative failure to produce change and potentially highly significant shifts in contraceptive uptake. Altogether, this data suggests that the PNC intervention likely produced a more meaningful shift in contraceptive uptake, possibly approaching or exceeding the 10% threshold we had set out when starting the pilot.</p><p>As such, our decision to shut down is based primarily on further research we conducted in response to some of the findings of our pilot, rather than the efficacy of the pilot programming. We now believe that a 10% shift in postpartum contraceptive uptake is likely to still fall substantially below the cost-effectiveness threshold at which a program like this would be worth scaling. Postpartum family planning programmes appear to produce limited or no changes in pregnancy rates - due in large part to the prevalence of postpartum insusceptibility - meaning that we believe contraceptive uptake in this period may produce little improvement to health or autonomy. These conclusions are discussed in-depth in the following section.</p><p><i>Further information on our pilot results will be available in a forthcoming journal article.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Why We No Longer Believe Postpartum Family Planning Is Among The Most Cost-Effective Interventions</strong></h2><p><i>There are several important reasons why we no longer believe postpartum family planning programming is the best use of MHI\u2019s resources. As these conclusions are based on substantial further research, some of this section is comparatively technical.</i><br>&nbsp;</p><h3>Evidence of Limited Effects on Unintended Pregnancies</h3><p>Family planning interventions are typically assessed based on their effects on contraceptive uptake, under the assumption that increases in uptake will necessarily translate into reduced unintended pregnancies. Postpartum family planning has been recognized as a \u201cproven\u201d high-impact practice in family planning \u2013 and hence received significant funding \u2013 on that basis (<a href=\"https://www.fphighimpactpractices.org/briefs/immediate-postpartum-family-planning/\"><u>HIP Partnership, 2022)</u></a>. However, our experience working in this space has led us to believe that the connection between contraceptive uptake and unintended pregnancies is less clear-cut.&nbsp;</p><p>Measuring the effects of family planning interventions on unintended and short-spaced pregnancies has not been prioritised; hence, the evidence is limited. However, the evidence available is not promising for the efficacy of postpartum programming. Of the three studies we found that measure the effects of facility-based postpartum family planning programming on pregnancy rates, two found no effect (Rohr et al.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13625187.2023.2290985\"><u>2024</u></a>; Coulibaly et al.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10964-w\"><u>2021</u></a>), and one found only a 0.7% decrease in short-spaced pregnancies (Guo et al.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35727080/\"><u>2022</u></a>)<i>.&nbsp;</i>This suggests that facility-based programs may have limited to no effect on reducing unintended pregnancies despite increasing contraceptive uptake. More research investigating this area is needed to draw confident conclusions, but this is certainly concerning.</p><p>Increases in family planning uptake are primarily valuable insofar as they allow women to avert mistimed or unintended pregnancies. If modern contraceptive uptake does not change the likelihood of pregnancy, it will not have an impact on the rates of short-spaced pregnancies, maternal mortality, or other health outcomes. It will also do little to provide women with additional autonomy or control over their reproductive lives.</p><p>Surprisingly \u2013 or unsurprisingly, depending on your perspective \u2013 these studies do not appear to have generated much discussion regarding the usefulness of postpartum family planning programming itself. Even within the studies themselves, the results regarding pregnancy rates are not treated as particularly significant; in one study, for example, they are reported in a single line and receive no discussion (Coulibaly et al.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10964-w\"><u>2021</u></a>). However, we believe that they are very significant for evaluating the true impact of such programs and the lack of engagement speaks to the ease with which programs can focus on proxy rather than true endline measures of impact.<br>&nbsp;</p><h3>The Prevalence and Impact of Postpartum Insusceptibility</h3><p>Postpartum insusceptibility describes the period after birth in which a mother is naturally at zero or extremely low risk of pregnancy due to a combination of sexual abstinence and amenorrhea due to breastfeeding.&nbsp;</p><p>Our study found very high rates of abstinence - 96% at baseline and 98.1% at endline in the PNC arm and 67.6% at baseline and 81.7% at endline in the CWC arm - coupled with near-universal breastfeeding practice. New users of contraception who are already protected by abstinence and/or breastfeeding will not incur additional benefits from modern forms of contraception. Investigating this further, we found that these results generalise across much of Sub-Saharan Africa.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.statcompiler.com/en/?cc=AO,BJ,BT,BF,BU,CM,CF,TD,KM,CG,CD,CI,EG,ER,SZ,ET,GA,GM,GH,GN,KE,LS,LB,MD,MW,ML,MR,MA,MZ,NM,NI,NG,RW,ST,SN,SL,ZA,SD,TZ,TL,TG,TN,UG,ZM,ZW&amp;ucc=&amp;ic=FE_PPIS_W_MNI&amp;scl=1000&amp;dt=0&amp;pt=0&amp;ss=1&amp;sy=BJ-1996+2001+2006+2012_BF-1993+1999+2003+2010_BU-1987+2010_CM-1991+1998+2004+2011_TD-1997+2004_KM-1996_CG-2005_CD-2007_CI-1994+1998+2012_EG-1988+1992+1995+2000+2003+2005+2008_ER-1995_ET-2000+2005+2011_GA-2000+2012_GM-2013_GH-1988+1993+1998+2003+2008+2014_GN-1999+2005+2012_KE-1989+1993+1998+2003+2008+2014_LS-2004+2009_LB-1986+2007+2013_MD-1992+1997+2004+2008_MW-2000+2004+2010_ML-1987+1996+2001+2006+2012_MR-2000_MA-1992_MZ-1997+2003_NM-1992+2000+2006_NI-1992+1998+2006_NG-1990+2003+2008+2013_RW-1992+2000+2005+2008+2010+2015_SN-1986+1993+1997+2005+2010+2012+2014+2015+2016+2017+2018_SL-2008+2013_ZA-1998_TZ-1992+1996+1999+2004+2010+2015_TL-2009_TG-1988+1998_UG-1988+1995+2000+2006+2011_ZM-1992+1996+2002+2007+2013_ZW-1988+1994+1999+2005+2010&amp;lvlRnk=0&amp;brk=Natural&amp;si=FE_PPIS_W_MNI&amp;sbv=\"><u>DHS data</u></a> suggests the mean duration of postpartum insusceptibility is 14.57 months across 39 countries with available data.<br>&nbsp;</p><h3>Short-Spaced Pregnancies</h3><p>We now believe that the impact of postpartum family planning programs in reducing short-spaced pregnancies is likely to be overstated - though again, more research into this would be beneficial.</p><p>Short-spaced births are associated with lower levels of education and income (Rutstein&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dhsprogram.com/publications/publication-cr28-comparative-reports.cfm\"><u>2011</u></a>). Poorer and less educated women are typically less likely to obtain maternal and newborn care at health facilities and less likely to use contraception (Doctor et al.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12889-018-5695-z\"><u>2018</u></a>; Ba et al.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1877575619300618\"><u>2019</u></a>). This likely means programming like MHI\u2019s affects a significantly lower proportion of short-spaced pregnancies than we first believed.<br>&nbsp;</p><h3>Theory of Change</h3><p>Many of the above points feed into a revised assessment of the theory of change for postpartum family planning. This change is shown in the figure below, depicting our revised models for family planning\u2019s theory of change and level of confidence in each stage of the causal chain.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/oggjo027ssjoqk1hxzfd\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/qnaoakep9zktmgoqfcm2 130w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/vpqt1mecmrtldosdft44 260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/tqy6tmx0mzxrxdkdcszi 390w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/ptvek1gclqxmkvgtpyq2 520w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/nslkq8afvrl7nbhhji8o 650w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/tqjdat3wvzq7z6egu0um 780w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/atzxavqb3iq9dcpcaj94 910w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/ppm4wlpzyioparklwyga 1040w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/vlhcddt2qtygeurup9fd 1170w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/vhhkln52jphfozzbwtdr 1230w\"><figcaption><i>Revised theory of change (circa February 2024)</i></figcaption></figure><h3>Other Factors</h3><p>Significant further concerns around discontinuation rates, cultural barriers, measurement of unmet need, and LARC-focused programming are discussed in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://maternalhealthinitiative.org/final-summary-of-our-work/\"><u>our full report</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Broader Thoughts on Family Planning</strong></h2><p>The discussion above is focused on postpartum family planning programming specifically. However, there are both positive and negative conclusions on the value of family planning work more broadly that are worthy of discussion.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Concerns</h3><p><strong>Fertility Rate Change</strong></p><p>This is an area of significant uncertainty but we believe more research is needed to demonstrate the robustness of the relationship between postpartum family planning uptake and fertility rate change. We expect that there is significant variation in the extent to which different types of family planning interventions drive reductions in unintended and short-spaced pregnancies. While our review of studies assessing facility-based postpartum family planning programs showed no strong effects on pregnancy rates (Rohr et al.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13625187.2023.2290985\"><u>2024</u></a>; Coulibaly et al.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-021-10964-w\"><u>2021</u></a>; Guo et al.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35727080/\"><u>2022</u></a>), there is limited evidence of more promising results for other types of programs&nbsp; (Glennerster et al.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/impact-mass-media-and-family-planning-campaigns-contraception-use-burkina-faso\"><u>2022</u></a>). Overall, there is a lack of robust evidence for such a crucial part of the theory of change for family planning work.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Side Effects</strong></p><p>Robust and well-considered opposition to contraceptive use due to concerns around side effects is too frequently grouped together with wilder \u2018myths and misconceptions\u2019 as information barriers needing to be solved. Side effects like inconsistent or excess bleeding may be seen as relatively manageable in Western countries with more accepting cultural norms and practices but can be far more significant in low-income countries (Kulhmann et al.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28661550/\"><u>2017</u></a>; Polis et al.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://reproductive-health-journal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12978-018-0561-0\"><u>2018</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Cultural practices around inconsistent or excess bleeding can prevent women from participating in a range of regular activities, including prayer, sexual activities, and community engagement (Bradley et al.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19499391/\"><u>2009</u></a>; Mohammed et al.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7580927/\"><u>2020</u></a>). Meanwhile, amenorrhea from contraceptive use is frequently interpreted as a sign of pregnancy and therefore potential promiscuity (Mackenzie et al.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1363/46e1520\"><u>2020</u></a>). Given these consequences, the choice of some women not to use hormonal contraception in order to avoid these consequences is worthy of respect and support.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Reasons We Still Believe In The Importance Of Family Planning Work</h2><p>Despite the points above, we still believe that some family planning interventions can be hugely impactful.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The need for action</strong></p><p>Without aid investments in family planning, millions of women may be denied the opportunity to control whether and when to have children. Cultural barriers to family planning uptake that mean many women lack control over their reproductive lives may make cost-effective programming difficult but are not an excuse for inaction. Instead, they suggest the need for different approaches that more directly address and engage these cultural barriers rather than seeking to circumvent them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Promising approaches</strong></p><p>Mass media family planning interventions have the potential to reach millions of women at a greatly reduced cost compared to facility-based work. They also benefit from reaching the community as a whole, thereby addressing cultural barriers and encouraging discussion amongst couples that may lead to changes in desired family size.</p><p>We are also enthusiastic about more family planning interventions focused on supply rather than demand. Stockouts of contraceptive methods - when a facility has no supply of a commodity on a given day - prevent women who already wish to use family planning from taking up a method. Supply chain management interventions show promise in reducing stockouts (Krug et al.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0236659#sec004\"><u>2020</u></a>), albeit with a shallow basis of evidence.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Autonomy</strong></p><p>Finally, and perhaps most importantly, family planning programming is worthwhile for its effects on women\u2019s autonomy. There are few decisions that are likely to be more significant in a person\u2019s life than whether and when to have children. Measuring improvements to autonomy is difficult, even more so when trying to compare potential interventions. With that said, we believe that providing family planning information and access to women with genuine unmet need is likely to be one of the most impactful ways of increasing autonomy. Given people will often sacrifice a significant degree of wealth, happiness, and health for a greater degree of freedom, increasing autonomy may be one of the most significant avenues for improving people\u2019s lives.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Choosing to Shut Down</strong></h2><p>There are uncertainties and caveats to all broader research conclusions. Our assessment of the value of postpartum family planning is far from immune to these. With that said, the analysis and reasoning summarised above give us a strong sense that postpartum family planning is unlikely to be as cost-effective as other approaches to increasing family planning access, and other approaches in global health more broadly.</p><p>MHI was founded with an explicit goal of starting one of the most effective charities in the world. If a new organisation such as ours does not exceed the value of existing work, we are merely shifting impact rather than creating additional value. As such, our conclusions around the lowered value of postpartum family planning left us with a choice to either pivot or shut down.<br>&nbsp;</p><h3>Considering a Pivot</h3><p>A pivot makes sense when an organisation has clear comparative advantages that it can leverage into a new area of work. For MHI, we believe our primary comparative advantages were significant experience and stakeholder relationships in delivering healthcare facility-based interventions in Ghana and substantial experience and knowledge in delivering family planning programming.</p><p>Ultimately, we decided that a pivot in either of these directions did not seem sufficiently compelling to be worth pursuing.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why not pivot to a different area of work in Ghana?</strong></p><p>We chose to work in Ghana because of its rates of unmet need, strong healthcare system, and relatively low contraceptive uptake. We now believe that Ghana is unlikely to be one of the most cost-effective countries to work in for the majority of interventions. Our aim was to pilot a system of integrating contraceptive counselling into routine care that could be adopted by a national healthcare system. This long-term vision of government adoption meant that a more resilient and centrally managed healthcare system such as Ghana\u2019s may prove more cost-effective than a country with higher baseline need.&nbsp;</p><p>We believe that this was a worthwhile approach, albeit one that did not work out in hindsight. However, the choice to work in Ghana means that MHI built stakeholder relationships and operating expertise in a country with relatively better healthcare outcomes across most indicators compared to other countries in sub-Saharan Africa.&nbsp;</p><p>This means that other work MHI could have pivoted to in Ghana was unlikely to be as cost-effective as a new project or other similar organisations working in different countries with higher burdens of disease and mortality.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why not pivot to another family planning intervention?</strong></p><p>We believe that there are other approaches to increasing contraceptive uptake that are likely to be effective in producing positive outcomes. There are several other family planning interventions we believe may be highly promising: mass media for social behaviour change, the direct provision of contraceptive methods, reductions in facility-level contraceptive stockouts, and policy shifts in who can offer methods and how methods are procured.&nbsp;</p><p>However, there is a wealth of both large and small organisations - such as Clinton Health Access Initiative (<a href=\"https://www.clintonhealthaccess.org/report/chai-and-the-reproductive-health-supplies-coalition-release-the-2023-family-planning-market-report/\"><u>CHAI</u></a>),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jhpiego.org/\"><u>Jhpiego</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.msichoices.org/\"><u>MSI</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://lafiyanigeria.org/\"><u>Lafiya Nigeria</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.familyempowermentmedia.org/\"><u>Family Empowerment Media</u></a> - that are already delivering family planning work that appears to be producing significant impact. This reduces the counterfactual of pivoting MHI to another family planning approach.&nbsp;</p><p>More significantly, there is a difficult question of personal enthusiasm and belief in an area of work. For one of us, family planning is no longer an intervention area that we want to work in due to some of the critiques raised in the \u2018Broader concerns with family planning\u2019 section. Elements of these critiques are an area of respectful disagreement between co-founders. However, given neither co-founder wanted to pursue an MHI pivot on their own, it significantly undermines any case for MHI to pivot into a different area of family planning work.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><h3>Proceeding to Shut Down</h3><p>The value of pivoting an existing organisation, in comparison to starting a new one, is hard to determine. However, we believe that the value of MHI at this stage in its development lies predominantly in the knowledge and skills of the people involved.&nbsp;</p><p>By shutting down and potentially starting something new, our skills can be used on the most useful things rather than what makes the most sense within the scope of MHI. Similarly, by shutting down we can redirect MHI\u2019s funding to other organisations with more promising signs of success. Founding is also demanding work - time away is likely to make us both more effective at whatever project we contribute to next. While pivoting MHI would have some benefits, we think these are significantly outweighed by the benefits of stepping away laid out above.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Lessons</strong></h2><p><i>While we think MHI\u2019s programming was ultimately undermined by the reduced value of postpartum family planning compared to other interventions, there are more than enough mistakes that we made that may have improved the quality of our intervention. In the hope that other organisations may benefit from these lessons, we have explored some of them below.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Insufficient clarity of focus</strong></p><p>As founders and directors of MHI, we were ambitious in what we set out to achieve.&nbsp;</p><p>While this was admirable, with hindsight it is clear that we attempted to deliver far too many things simultaneously. In choosing to do a lot of different things, we undermined our ability to do the few, most important things exceptionally well. There was a mismatch between our desire for speed and our willingness to streamline things. Choosing to test one intervention arm rather than two in our pilot would have allowed us to focus far greater resources on refining its design and implementation. Too much time spent on organisation-building (communications; internal process improvements; funder relationships) detracted from the time available for improving our programming: the core driver of whether or not MHI would be successful.&nbsp;</p><p>Developing a program offers a seemingly infinite number of avenues of work that appear worthwhile. Many things seem likely to make your program better. However, the choice to pursue an additional research question, monitoring strategy, or surveying metric is almost never a choice to do one more thing. It is a choice to do one more&nbsp;<i>category</i> of things, and will likely produce many more questions and areas of work needing to be completed in the process of solving a singular question or issue. In this way, each additional avenue of work that you pursue increases the burden of work exponentially.&nbsp;</p><p>The solution to this is a clear vision of your organisation\u2019s priorities and perhaps a willingness to cut and discard more areas of work than seems reasonable. If you are only choosing not to do things that feel superfluous, you are likely not streamlining your work nearly enough.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Consistent underconfidence as an organisation</strong></p><p>It is easy - and to some extent entirely justified - to feel imposter syndrome when founding an organisation in a field in which neither co-founder has prior experience. While this makes sense, MHI likely suffered from a collective underconfidence.&nbsp;</p><p>In our approach to working in Ghana, we positioned ourselves as a small actor with much to learn. In our first meetings with key stakeholders, we had a lot of open questions, lacked a clear vision of what kind of program we wanted to implement, and were reluctant to push for demanding requests or requirements. While this was very reasonable, it also spoke to an excess level of underconfidence that undermined MHI\u2019s work. Asking for more from the government and from our partners may have felt a little unreasonable given our lack of experience, but would have made elements of our work significantly easier.&nbsp;</p><p>More broadly, it is easy to worry too much about external signals of what a successful organisation should do or look like. Are we getting to the point of running a pilot swiftly enough? Is this the stage at which we should begin hiring staff? How much research do other organisations do before committing to a country of operation? These are the wrong type of questions to ask. What matters is how these decisions make sense in the context of your organisation and your program. When do you need pilot results to be able to raise further funding before your seed funding runs out? What benefits would a new staff member bring relative to the costs of hiring and management time? What are the key questions we need to answer to know which country is most promising to start work in and how do we answer these?&nbsp;<br><br>While we likely believed at the time that our decisions were based on questions specific to our organisation, with hindsight some of these key decisions seem overly swayed by considerations about what people would expect an organisation like ours to be doing in this circumstance.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/hjyjfxlman6bvspnkmfh\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/oed74uagvx4q7dywc1dd 200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/rqjr9zzxmbi3zibpybas 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/efhqhs7dvwapzcavchwz 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/vzaomkatszwxepbaftcy 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/drglcwculrn7jke2qkmn 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/harjacwctz74blga7s9z 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/akatt9tx64uwjjeif6jp 1400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/zqyevfhzpdc2iblyjzhf 1600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/jieadoqktu41aoenyi9a 1800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MWSwSXNmsSBaEKtKw/lyyauefvnhkblplmzqzp 1999w\"><figcaption><i>A client survey delivered by a member of the Norsaac implementation team</i></figcaption></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Data Collection Challenges</strong></p><p>Throughout our work, we grappled with the difficulty of acquiring reliable data about confidential counselling through a public healthcare system. We had hoped to use facility-level data to assess how MHI\u2019s programming affected the long-term trends in contraceptive uptake. Sadly, facilities had frequent gaps in their records and some records appeared to be duplicates, leaving little scope to trust the reliability of the facility-level data we received.&nbsp;</p><p>The quality of the surveying delivered through our partner organisations was significantly higher. However, we struggled to find mechanisms for collecting data free from potential bias. In one case, our client and provider surveying data suggested MHI\u2019s materials were in use for counselling during a CWC session that we attended in person, yet our own observation highlighted that they were not.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Our best, though imperfect, solution to this was to triangulate data from multiple sources in order to determine the reliability of each source. The CWC session above is a good example of this in practice, with in-person observation allowing us to assess the reliability of observation from our partners, client surveying data, and provider surveying data.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Willingness to spend</strong></p><p>In part due to our data collection issues, we spent a significant amount of time debating and investigating uncertainties around our program through desk research that could have been resolved far more swiftly through fieldwork. Knowing your organisation\u2019s weekly or monthly burn rate - the amount it costs just to keep the lights on each month - can encourage spending on the most useful things. Additional monitoring work may seem prohibitively expensive at a cost of $5,000, but it pays for itself if it saves more than two weeks of work for an organisation with 2+ staff by resolving the causes of implementation issues.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Conclusions</strong></h2><p>Shutting down MHI was not the outcome we wished for when we founded the organisation in the summer of 2022. While our pilot likely failed to deliver the impact we had hoped, we believe with further iteration and improved implementation the impact on contraceptive uptake likely would have increased. Ultimately, this decision is based on concerns around the endline impact of our programming: changes in maternal and child health, and maternal autonomy. Rates of postpartum insusceptibility and method discontinuation, reduced impact on short-spaced pregnancies, incorrect estimates of unmet need, weak data connecting uptake to pregnancy rate shifts, and the importance of cultural barriers to uptake combine to suggest that postpartum family planning is unlikely to be as cost-effective as the top alternative family planning and global health interventions.</p><p>Upon drawing these conclusions, we considered pivots to other facility-based interventions in Ghana or other areas of family planning work in other countries. However, we believe that a pivot in these directions is unlikely to be the best use of MHI\u2019s resources relative to redirecting the talent and funding to other new or existing organisations. This left us with the decision to shut down MHI\u2019s operations.</p><p>It is essential that organisations are willing to hold themselves to high standards and shut down if they do not believe their work is effective. The value of new development charities - such as those set up by Charity Entrepreneurship (AIM) - is largely dependent on finding avenues for additional impact relative to existing organisations pursuing similar work. We set out with the aim of creating one of the most cost-effective charities in the world. In acknowledging our likely failure to reach this standard, we hope to encourage other organisations to engage deeply with the impact and counterfactuals of their own work with a willingness to shut down if this appears appropriate.</p><p>Thank you for taking the time to engage with MHI\u2019s work and decision to shut down.

Of course it\u2019s extremely uncertain, and may depend a lot on the perspective it\u2019s being asked from. But that doesn\u2019t mean we can\u2019t say anything.&nbsp;If I condition on some broadly-consequentialist axiology that I might come to endorse on reflection, here\u2019s a cartoon showing very roughly what my probability distribution might look like, with all possible worlds arranged best-to-worst as you go top-to-bottom:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iuzcdfsKQEEoPj2Gf/jjiwivwqocknjnkntacx\"><figcaption>(Probability mass on this diagram is represented by \u201cvertical space\u201d. If you want an nth centile world, you can draw a line n% of the way up and read off its goodness in the horizontal dimension.)</figcaption></figure><p>This isn\u2019t supposed to be in the vicinity of precise; especially the goodness scale is not necessarily linear. But the key high-level features that I do (tentatively) stand behind, and want to draw attention to, are:</p><ul><li>There\u2019s a reasonable probability mass on \u201cnon-futures\u201d; things which are close to zero total value</li><li>There\u2019s a reasonable probability mass on \u201cgreat futures\u201d, which are all in-the-same-ballpark as good as each other, and all much better than ~anything not in this cluster</li><li>There\u2019s a small probability mass on \u201chellish futures\u201d, which would be very bad</li><li>There are reasonable probability masses on \u201cfine futures\u201d and \u201cbad futures\u201d, but the total goodness or badness of these is small compared to the great or hellish futures<ul><li>There is a little probability mass on things which are a reasonable fraction of the great or hellish futures \u2014 mostly corresponding to worlds in which the lightcone is divided in some way<ul><li>Trade means that the probability of such outcomes isn\u2019t so high, and I\u2019ll set them aside for now; however, I think that this would be a natural place to extend this analysis</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>What\u2019s going on here? Basically I think:</p><ul><li>A lot of decisions have to be made correctly to get to something that\u2019s within spitting distance of the best accessible futures</li><li>These decisions are vanishingly unlikely to all \u2014 or even close to all \u2014 be made correctly by chance</li><li>So the great worlds are ones in which there\u2019s some decision-making process which is systematically making good decisions<ul><li>At this point it will likely get <i>all</i>&nbsp;of the decisions pretty-much right, and we\u2019ll be in one of the worlds that\u2019s basically getting things right<ul><li>(i.e. I mostly buy some version of the convergent morality thesis)</li></ul></li><li>Probably the value of such worlds scales to a first approximation with the amount of stuff that they can do good things with, and this is likely not to vary too much between future possible worlds (astronomical waste from delay is small in relative terms), so likely all of the great worlds are in the same ballpark as good as one another<ul><li>(There are definitely ways this assumption could fail, but I think it\u2019s most-likely correct, so I\u2019m going to run with it for now)</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>It\u2019s not vanishingly unlikely to establish such a decision-making process, so there\u2019s a not-vanishingly-small probability mass on these great futures<ul><li>This is taking a position in the direction of the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XMrEvXrhAA2eKncJp/moral-realism\">convergent morality thesis</a><ul><li>Though for the conclusions that follow you don't need such a strong assumption as actually-convergent morality from adequate decision-making processes.

But for now let\u2019s explore what it even says), it seems especially important to maximize the probability of getting such great futures (and to minimize the probability of hellish futures).</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"Horizons\">Horizons</h1><p>OK, so now we know what to aim for? Well, not so fast. Unfortunately it\u2019s not very action-guiding to say \u201caim for great futures\u201d because we don\u2019t get to see (in time) how everything plays out, and the future is famously hard to predict. We can imagine the future as having a fog over it, such that it gets harder to see through the further away things are.</p><p>Here\u2019s a picture of that, with a couple of semi-arbitrary divisions drawn on it to help us discuss the picture:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iuzcdfsKQEEoPj2Gf/oxgswqhihtkwyik0a4d7\" alt=\"A person looks into the fog of the future, which grows denser as it gets further out. Things look blurry beyond the Planning Horizon (5-20 yrs?), and opaque beyond the Foresight Horizon (50-1000 yrs?)\"></figure><p>The Planning Horizon is, roughly speaking, the limit of our normal ability to make sensible plans and prepare for specific eventualities. We can get ready for things further away than this, but details are obscured by the fog, so normally we have to act via broader, less specific plans. Of course in practice exactly how far out it is will vary according to the domain, the person doing the planning, and the type of plan. But for illustrative purposes we can imagine that it usually occurs less than twenty years out.</p><p>The Foresight Horizon is the point past which we can\u2019t really see anything in the fog. In most cases we can\u2019t make meaningful predictions about the impacts of our actions beyond this point. There are (important!) exceptions where we have strong reason to believe something may be persistent for a very long time. But mostly I think it\u2019s hard to reason about anything past a thousand years, and perhaps much sooner (especially if technological change accelerates, these horizons might all come much closer in calendar time).</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"Stable_basins\">Stable basins</h1><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref1\">If we care about events far beyond the Foresight Horizon, how can we hope to have any predictable effects? Now we come to the exceptions. Some states of the world are highly stable and likely to persist for a very long time. The extinction of humanity is one such state. It would commit us to one of the non-futures<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"93wwg98g7es\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref93wwg98g7es\"><sup><a href=\"#fn93wwg98g7es\">[1]</a></sup></span>, and we could be confident that this would continue past the normal Foresight Horizon. Understanding the world as a dynamical system, we can regard human extinction state, and existential risk more broadly as a basin of attraction \u2014 if we once enter the basin, we won\u2019t leave, so this is predictive of long-run outcomes.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iuzcdfsKQEEoPj2Gf/bnydnzxy23mpfxycswix\" alt=\"Looking into the future, now with a basin marked 'X' which only gets bigger as time passes, into the Long Run\"></figure><p>This is the basis (as I understand it) for the Maxipok principle. If everything else washes out in expectation, <i>at least</i>&nbsp;we can aim to have persistent long-term impact by maximizing the probability that things still look OK (i.e. not in the existential catastrophe basin) at the Foresight Horizon.</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"Good_reflective_governance\">Good reflective governance</h1><p>But now that we\u2019ve got our eye on the possibility of basins of attraction \u2014 might there be others? In fact I think we\u2019ve already considered one. I said I expected that all the great futures came about because there was a decision-making process making systematically good decisions. I think that having the future in the hands of such a process \u2014 or a good-enough forebear of such a process \u2014 would also function as a basin of attraction. It would be important by the lights of the decision-making process to ensure that the future it passed on was at least as well equipped (if not better) in the decision-making department, as well as that it avoided any major traps.</p><p>I will call this the basin of good reflective governance. The idea is that this is a region which has good enough reflective processes, and a good enough starting point, that it will eventually get itself to something great. This concept is close to that of the long reflection, in that the key feature is that there\u2019s a lot of reflection that will be needed to ensure that things go well. I\u2019m not using that term because it\u2019s not obvious that \u201cthe reflection\u201d is a distinct phase: it could be that reflection is an ongoing process into the deep future, tackling new (perhaps local) questions as they arise.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iuzcdfsKQEEoPj2Gf/utsqanwog7i90pc7zidy\" alt=\"Same diagram as before, with a second basin appearing a little later, entitled &quot;good reflective governance&quot;\"></figure><p>Now there are two legitimate targets: reduce the probability of falling into the existential catastrophe basin (before the Foresight Horizon), and increase the probability of making it into the good reflective governance basin (before the Foresight Horizon; I generally think it would be premature to try to rush there within the Planning Horizon).</p><p>What do we really know about the good reflective governance basin? Unfortunately, I think we don\u2019t understand it terribly well. I am inclined to think that it\u2019s not vanishingly narrow \u2014 I\u2019m not too concerned that any <a href=\"https://joecarlsmith.com/2024/01/11/an-even-deeper-atheism#human-paperclippers\">humans except myself-in-the-moment-of-writing would be like paperclippers to me</a>. But this is me gesturing at intuition, not giving a carefully reasoned argument. Still, if that is right, I know at least that there are some principles of good thinking that need to make it in, and also some foundational moral values. I don\u2019t know what all of the things that are important to have included are.</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"Other_traps\">Other traps</h1><p>I don\u2019t think we know enough to confidently specify points in the basin at the moment. For this reason, on the diagram above I\u2019ve only marked the basin as starting after the Planning Horizon \u2014 I simply don\u2019t think it makes sense yet to make active plans that would land us in the basin. And one thing which is concerning is that it\u2019s not the only basin of reflective governance. The world could end up in the hands of a thoughtful paperclipper, or a reflective-dictatorship-that-ultimately-missed-what-is-valuable. In each case if it enters into the basin where the reflection of the steering intelligence determines what follows, we should not expect it to escape. These will mostly correspond to either \u201cfine futures\u201d or \u201cbad futures\u201d in the long run.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/iuzcdfsKQEEoPj2Gf/yqifzi3veowckjxsbd1b\" alt=\"The same diagram, but with another &quot;flawed reflective governance&quot; basin close to the good one\"></figure><p>And since we don\u2019t know exactly what ingredients are required for good reflective governance, the concern is that <i>in aiming for the good reflective governance basin</i>&nbsp;we might accidentally commit ourselves to something flawed. I\u2019m rather more scared of missing ingredients than of accidentally including too many things in the initial setup \u2014 since, by presumption, good reflective processes can help to separate what\u2019s truly important from what isn\u2019t. But perhaps there are some ingredients which could be cancerous and distort an otherwise good reflective process from the inside.</p><p>I think that there are factors I\u2019m pretty happy to say make it more likely we enter into the good reflective governance basin. A general focus across society on truth-seeking, on cooperation, on sincerity, and on moral action, seem like they are obviously more helpful than not. Technical tools which facilitate these things may also lay important groundwork. And exploring more what good reflective governance might look like could be of high importance. For there may come a time when some actors need to make decisions about this, and reducing the chance that they accidentally choose poorly seems wise. This strategy of shifting background variables such that the future world seems more likely to steer towards the basin is paradigmatically aiming to reach it after the Planning Horizon but before the Foresight Horizon.</p><p>In principle, one could also be interested in interventions which persist past the Foresight Horizon that aren\u2019t to do with either of these attractors. In general I\u2019m fairly sceptical that these should be high priorities. I think that most stable attractors which aren\u2019t the basin of good reflective governance may end up cutting us off from the ability to properly consider things later. Perhaps there is something that could be done which locks in avoidance of certain risks without otherwise making commitments on direction. But I guess that that will typically not look better than simply working to robustly reduce those risks within the Foresight Horizon.</p><ol class=\"footnote-section footnotes\" data-footnote-section=\"\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"93wwg98g7es\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn93wwg98g7es\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"93wwg98g7es\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref93wwg98g7es\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>&nbsp;Actually it\u2019s possible that some other source of intelligent life could arise.

And they apply more strongly to people from similar cultures than from very distant cultures (although I mostly still hold the intuitions for people from distant cultures, my evidence base there mostly comes from looking at philosophers in the past, who came from societies with significant differences but also significant overlap with my own).</p><p>So it looks like there\u2019s at least a region of mind-space where this kind of dynamic applies. This <strong>doesn\u2019t</strong>&nbsp;tell us what should happen with alien minds, but I think it\u2019s a pretty big update away from a prior of \u201cmaybe what people want is just pretty arbitrary/idiosyncratic\u201d. If the hypothesis is false, it\u2019s either because (1) somewhere on the spectrum in-between us and alien minds the reflective process breaks down so that it loses the property of reflection leading to convergence; or (2) morality is a mix of the derivable and underivable (and humanity has quite idiosyncratic choices for the underivable parts). On my impression (1) is relatively implausible, but (2) is a real possibility (explored further below).</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref1\">More generally, I suspect that intuitions in favour of moral realism are in many cases also intuitions in favour of the straightforward case for the convergent morality thesis, so there might well be some good discussion of this in the philosophical literature.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"au2r5upy1dg\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefau2r5upy1dg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnau2r5upy1dg\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><h3 data-internal-id=\"Is_morality_a_mix_of_the_derivable_and_the_underivable_\">Is morality a mix of the derivable and the underivable?</h3><p>A thought experiment suggests this at least sometimes happens. If we had a society of beings who deep in their bones valued paperclips, and another who deep in their bones valued staples, it does seem somewhat likely they\u2019d both derive e.g. prohibitions against stealing, or utilitarian instincts towards resource-allocation, as these would help the societies to run more effectively towards their eventual goal of producing vast quantities of their preferred stationary.</p><p>Is this what\u2019s going on for humans? I\u2019m not sure that it is. It does seem to me that a lot of human morality has developed <i>in service</i>&nbsp;of the goal of making more humans (and hence making society prosper so that it can afford to feed more humans, win conflicts with other societies, etc.). But I don\u2019t think that has stuck with us; if you look at the outputs of our moral reflection I think we\u2019ve gone deeper than things which are just in the service of making more humans.</p><p>If I\u2019m right about that (that making more humans ultimately drove a lot of our moral intuitions but is a scaffolding we will eventually relinquish \u2014 and in many cases already have), there are three possibilities:</p><ol><li>Each human will have a significantly different extrapolated volition (/axiology); the apparent convergence-from-reflection is a local phenomenon which occurs at some levels of sophistication but will fall away before the end.</li><li>Many humans (e.g. those trying to be moral and reflective) will have convergent extrapolated volitions (/axiologies). But these will be based on various idiosyncrasies of humanity, and we can\u2019t reasonably expect convergence from non-human minds.</li><li>Our extrapolated morality will converge to something more universal, such that we could expect convergence from some alien minds (perhaps mostly just those who similarly had their moral intuitions shaped by evolution in a social setting, or perhaps something broader).</li></ol><p>When I hear discussion of the complexity of value, I normally imagine people are supposing something like B). But my current guess is that it is the least likely of these three possibilities \u2014 I\u2019m quite unsure how to think about this, but if forced to put numbers on them now I might say 40% A), 15% B), 45% C). I think B) gets penalized relative to the other two because it postulates more complex behaviour \u2014 rather than one basic pattern that applies across minds, it says there\u2019s something relatively special about the closeness of human minds to each other relative to their closeness to other minds.</p><p>Then I think for practical decision-making purposes we should apply a heavy discount to world A) \u2014 in that world, what everyone else would eventually want isn\u2019t all that close to what I would eventually want. Moreover what me-of-tomorrow would eventually want probably isn\u2019t all that close to what me-of-today would eventually want. So it\u2019s much much less likely that the world we end up with even if we save it is close to the ideal one by my lights. Moreover, even though these worlds possibly differ significantly, I don\u2019t feel like from my present position I have that much reason to be opinionated between them; it\u2019s unclear that I\u2019d greatly imperfect worlds according to the extrapolated volition of some future-me, relative to the imperfect worlds according to the extrapolated volition of someone else I think is pretty reasonable.</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"The_convoluted_case\">The convoluted case</h2><p>Perhaps many minds end up at a shared notion of what they\u2019re aiming for, via <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/acausal-trade\">acausal trade</a>&nbsp;(getting to some grand bargain), or <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/evidential-cooperation-in-large-worlds\">evidential cooperation in large worlds</a>.

I got some helpful feedback and haven't really pursued it further. I study US private foundations as a researcher and recently conducted a qualitative data collection of staff at 20 very large US private foundations ($100m+ assets). The subject of the study isn't directly EA related (focused mostly on how they use accounting/effectiveness information and accountability), but it got me thinking a lot!</p><p>Some interesting observations that I am going to explore further, in future forum posts (if y'all think it's interesting) and future research papers:</p><ol><li>Trust-based philanthropy (TBP), a funder movement that's only been around since 2020, has had a HUGE impact on very large private foundations. All 20 indicated that they had already/were in the process of integrating TBP into their grantmaking. <i>I can't emphasize enough how influential TBP has been. </i>(This is a major finding of our current paper that is being drafted).</li><li>It was not a planned question, but I often asked if they/their foundation knew about EA and if it had influenced their giving. Some were slightly aware of EA, and primarily had a <i>negative perception</i>. None were convinced by EA ideas and none indicated their foundation had been influenced by EA.</li><li>When pressed about their feelings about EA, many suggested that they viewed EA and TBP as being incompatible with one another (either you trust your grantees [TBP] or you evaluate them rigorously [EA]), and they were choosing TBP. Which was pretty interesting to me, as I don't think they are incompatible (this is probably a paper I am going to get going here soon). I think a place where there is a disconnect is that these PF basically think being EA-aligned means you have to be a major pain in the ass to your grantees.</li></ol><p>There certainly are major roadblocks to integrating EA into US private foundations. Their charters typically force them to concentrate their giving in specific cause areas/geographic areas, which by design are constraints not particularly compatible with EA. But I do still believe there is potential for progress to be made, even if it doesn't mean PF funds get to EA directly. No matter the type of constraints of a PF charter, within those constraints, EA principles can still cause them to increase their effectiveness.&nbsp;</p><p>How can EA make inroads with these major funders, and does it potentially start with a model for effective giving that is willing to relax on necessary principles so as to allow for constraints? Some constraints are easier to relax than others: a constraint that says \"we must focus on education\" is easier than \"we must focus on the state of Delaware\".&nbsp;</p><p>-</p><p>Anyway, all of this is on my mind and I am writing this to procrastinate from actually writing the paper that this all comes from!

If you die, you do not think your life was valueless just because you don\u2019t remember the valuable parts later, so evaluations of the value of moments in terms of their evaluation in later moments does not seem promising</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Imagining whether you would want to live a life going forward, knowing everything that will happen including the objective time, still leaves people with the intuition that it is subjective time that counts, but this doesn\u2019t give us an explanation of why we think that \u2013 more to the point, directly grounding wellbeing on what a hypothetical subject would choose in a certain situation relies an assumption that the agent is prudent, and it therefore first requires an explanation of why it would be prudent to prefer people to look at your life in terms of subjective time</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Cognitive Theory of Subjective time:</h1>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Andreas Mogenson recently posted a preprint skeptical of the plausibility of wellbeing functions sensitive to subjective experience of time, with a special focus on different theories of what subjective time experience consists in, and why none of these things justifies plugging them into wellbeing very well</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>One theory he discusses is something like \u201cframe rate\u201d of experience, but this seems quite implausible to me as a theory of subjective time value</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This theory only explains subjective experience of time if/when it results in the conditions of the cognitive theory of subjective experience (otherwise it only changes something like \u201cresolution\u201d of experience), so its explanation of subjective time is parasitic on the cognitive explanation</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>This theory only gives a different explanation of the wellbeing value of subjective time if there are gaps in objective time between frames (reference Michael St. Jules\u2019 version of this in which frames are infinitesimal and merely added up rather than integrated), leaving more or less experience in a given unit of time, therefore it just explains that subjective time matters because it coincides with differences in experience over objective time. Again, parasitic</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>The cognitive explanation is more unique on both accounts, it just says that subjective experience comes from a different rate of some cognitive process relative to stimulus</p>\n<p>Mogenson dismisses subjective time if this account is true, on the grounds that we wouldn\u2019t care about mere faster and slower thoughts when weighing up wellbeing</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He does concede that someone might claim that they derivatively care about this different rate because it turns out to be identical to, or at least exactly coincident to, subjective time, which we already know we care about, but he claims we are not actually introspectively acquainted with subjective time experience in the right way to make this claim, in the way we are with say suffering</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>I believe this response is correct, but he doesn\u2019t have a good enough response to the semi-related argument that reflective equilibrium asks us to lend greater credence to principles if their results match our practical moral intuitions, so someone sympathetic to reflective equilibrium at least has a reason to favor principles they otherwise wouldn\u2019t think of that imply that subjective time does matter to wellbeing</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Principled Justification for cognitive theory</h1>\n<p>there are two types of wellbeing theory</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Wellbeing of a being is just the amount of some universal axiological value contained by an individual, like measuring water out of a bucket</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Universal axiological value is first and foremost made of subjects, and the way to respect/value subjects is by promoting their wellbeing (universal measures of this wellbeing are just an effective proxy of how much subject benefiting one has done, maybe bring up Vulcan trolley problem)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>the cognitive theory explains subjective time by comparing an objective stream of stimulus and an objective stream of functional interpretation. The former could be seen as an input and the latter a function \u2013 a parametric integral of the former function in terms of the latter, specifically, produces the intuitive result of wellbeing over subjective time, while ultimately resting all terms on objective features of the situation</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Pure container-like theories of wellbeing seem unable to explain this, because the rest of the subject is just a circle one draws around an amount of the experience stream, but if we look at the cognitive stream as the \u201csubject\u201d part, then it makes sense that some of the subject theories of wellbeing will care about experiences only after they are run through experiencers in a certain way, and on the dimension of time, this will look like the needed parametric integral</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The relevance of this depends on the wellbeing theory to some extent. Preference satisfaction theories are almost inherently subject-based, but are a mix of things that are and are not subjective time-sensitive. Certain types of achievements in the real world are not subjective time-sensitive at all, but can either be container or subject view based. Hedonism seems to differ the most, and can be either container or subject-based</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>On inspection, the way all of these things relate wellbeing to subjective time or don\u2019t seems to match our intuitions, for instance in cases of what types of wellbeing one can and cannot impact by running a simulated mind at different speeds.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Objections:</h1>\n<p>\u201csubjects\u201d might not (probably don\u2019t) exist in a strong, metaphysical sense, which seems to undermine our ability to make \u201csubject-relative\u201d judgements</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Give the example of preference satisfaction again, as a pretty inherently subject relative wellbeing component, that seems to exist even if \u201csubjects\u201d don\u2019t</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Whatever sense preference satisfaction is subject relative in is also, at minimum, a sense that any wellbeing standard can be subject-relative in the absence of discrete metaphysical \u201csubjects\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Because \u201csubject\u201d here refers to the stream of functional, cognitive processes that stimulus interacts with, they are identifiable for any identifiable stimulus to a brain, thus providing an identifiable \u201csubject\u201d component to the experience in the absence of unitary \u201csubject lives\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>why should we identify with our thoughts rather than our experiences?</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If we have to choose between being our feelings and our thoughts, perhaps feelings does make more sense, in that feelings are the specifically \u201cinside\u201d part, no inside part, no you</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The presence of certain types of thought heavily contextualizes experience \u2013 see pain versus suffering, one could call this process \u201cperception\u201d</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Discuss time in this context, and the views of Kant and Merleau-Ponty</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Perception seems closer to how we identify than experience</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Discuss Mogenson\u2019s example of an experience that last longer but no time at all seems to pass</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>some theories of consciousness seem to make thought and feeling inseparable, such as illusionism and phenomenal intentionality theory</p>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>for illusionism, it is at least suggestive how many physical bases of experience are unchanged over common subjective time</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If you slow down all the processes of the body, the same number of neuron firings, the same amount of hormone release, anything like that, would occur. There would be more \u201cobjective experience\u201d because all of these firings and hormones will last longer and produce more overall experience per second, but if objective phenomenal experience doesn\u2019t exist, the physical basis of subjective experience could still be the same over the same subjective time</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>There would be a stronger basis for the \u201ccomputational\u201d argument Mogenson rejects, if we view the mind as purely behavioral\nI don\u2019t have much yet for the PIT objection, because I don\u2019t understand it that well yet. Possibly Frankfurt\u2019s \u201cIdentification and Externality\u201d distinction is relevant</p>\n</blockquote>\n</blockquote>\n<h1>Implications:</h1>\n<p>container theories might lose some plausibility relative to subject theories of wellbeing</p>\n<p>highlights a possible place where illusionist theories of mind will differ in their ethical judgements from realist theories</p>\n", "user": {"username": "Devin Kalish"}}, {"_id": "tXu7KCSePFkgbCLZq", "title": "[Applications open] Summer Internship with CEA\u2019s University Groups Team!", "postedAt": "2024-03-14T20:02:40.799Z", "htmlBody": "<h2>TLDR</h2><p>Applications for CEA\u2019s University Groups Team&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.notion.so/centreforeffectivealtruism/Draft-CEA-University-Groups-Team-Summer-24-Internship-aec84f99d35d4bf19560f031796ead2d\"><strong><u>summer internship</u></strong></a> have opened!</p><ul><li>Dates: flexible, during the Northern Hemisphere summer</li><li>Application deadline:&nbsp;<strong>Sunday, March 31</strong></li><li>Learn more &amp; apply&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.notion.so/centreforeffectivealtruism/Draft-CEA-University-Groups-Team-Summer-24-Internship-aec84f99d35d4bf19560f031796ead2d\"><u>here</u></a>!</li></ul><h2>What?</h2><p>CEA's University Groups Team is running a paid internship program!

New AI models are already being used in the wild to increase the scope and reduce the cost of attacks,<sup>2</sup> a trend which will only accelerate.<sup>3</sup></p><p>Attacks on critical infrastructure are limited due to restraint on behalf of state-level actors. However, AI may soon enable unaccountable non-state actors to carry out large-scale, sophisticated attacks.</p><p>AI will also enable better cyberdefense. However, due to structural issues in the way systems are developed, deployed, and managed, we frequently fail to take advantage of existing best practices, let alone the rapidly evolving capabilities that AI will provide. To navigate the coming wave, the technology and regulatory sectors must coordinate to address these issues. In the best case, <strong>AI can serve as both an enabling technology to improve defenses, and a wake-up call to address long-standing deficiencies in our approach to security</strong>.</p><h2>The Cyberattack Overhang over Critical Infrastructure</h2><p>It is hardly necessary to review the scale of the cybersecurity challenge. While many attacks go unreported, there is no lack of well-known incidents, from the Chinese breach of detailed personnel records for millions of Americans working in secure positions,<sup>4</sup> to the NotPetya attack (with damages estimated at over ten billion dollars<sup>5</sup>), to the Equifax data <strong>breach of records covering over 160 million Americans and British citizens</strong>.<sup>6</sup> A recent attack on the US\u2019 largest health care payment system is currently imperiling the finances of medical practices across the country.<sup>7</sup></p><p>However, this is potentially just the tip of the iceberg. A vast swath of critical infrastructure \u2013 the electrical grid, communications systems, water treatment facilities, air traffic control, port facilities,<sup>8</sup> military systems, and much more \u2013 relies on vulnerable systems. In 2021, a ransomware attack resulted in a major East Coast oil pipeline being shut down for several days,<sup>9</sup> causing panic buying and long lines at gas stations in multiple states. In December 2022, Southwest Airlines\u2019 crew scheduling system collapsed for several days,<sup>10</sup> resulting in over 15,000 flight cancellations. Numerous government reports detail the extent of vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure systems.<sup>11</sup> As the world becomes increasingly dependent on software systems (including increasing use of AI), <strong>a worst-case cyberattack could have severe consequences</strong>.</p><p>Disconcertingly, our lack of routine infrastructure failures seems to stem more from the reticence of potential attackers than from the inherent security of our systems. In other words, <strong>we are living under a \"cyberattack overhang\"</strong>.</p><p>Indeed, the US NSA and other agencies have reported on \u201cVolt Typhoon\u201d, an extensive Chinese effort to \u201cpreposition themselves on IT networks for disruptive or destructive cyberattacks against U.S. critical infrastructure\u201d.<sup>12</sup> <strong>Targets included ports, energy and water controls,</strong><sup>13</sup><strong> often near military bases</strong>. Increasingly capable AI will expand the potential scope of such attacks, as well as empowering non-state actors who might be less deterred by the consequences of an infrastructure attack. Given the difficulty of identifying the ultimate perpetrator of a cyberattack, the results could be destabilizing.</p><h2>AI Impacts on Cyber Offense and Defense</h2><p>AI has many foreseeable applications to cybersecurity. Some capabilities will primarily help attackers, while others will help defenders.</p><p>On the offensive side, AI will soon plausibly be able to <strong>automate the entire attack chain</strong>,<sup>14</sup> from intelligence gathering (analyzing public information to identify the software used by a target), to invoking a known exploit against the target software, and analyzing data in the target system to determine next steps.<sup>15</sup> Google projects that within the year, <strong>AI will also be used to scale \u201csocial engineering\u201d attacks</strong><sup>16</sup> (tricking personnel into revealing information or otherwise assisting an attacker); given the facility of large language models at crafting persuasive prose, this could have a large impact.</p><p>Conversely, AI should be able to automate many aspects of defense, such as detecting and correcting unpatched or misconfigured software. AI techniques are already used for \u201canomaly detection\u201d \u2013 identifying unusual behavior that might indicate an attack.<sup>17</sup> Coding assistants may eventually be able to automatically detect more bugs, as well as help \u201charden\u201d software by rewriting it to use more secure languages, libraries, and techniques, potentially including mathematical proofs of correctness.</p><p>In principle, progress might, on balance, favor defense. A system designed and operated by an ideal defender would have no vulnerabilities, leaving even an ideal attacker unable to break in.<sup>18</sup> Also, AI works best when given large amounts of data to work with, and defenders generally have access to more data.<sup>19</sup> However, absent substantial changes to cyber practices, we are likely to see many dramatic AI-enabled incidents.</p><p>The primary concern is that <strong>advances in defensive techniques are of no help if defenders are not keeping up to date</strong>. Despite decades of effort, it is well known that important systems are often misconfigured and/or running out-of-date software.<sup>20</sup> For instance, a sensitive application operated by credit report provider Equifax was found in 2017 to be accessible to anyone on the Internet, simply by typing \u201cadmin\u201d into the login and password fields.<sup>21</sup> A <a href=\"https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-12/CY2022-Administrative-Subpoena-for-Vulnerability-Notification-Year-in-Review-508c.pdf\">recent CISA report</a> notes that this government agency often needs to resort to subpoenas merely to <i>identify</i> the owners of vulnerable infrastructure systems, and that most issues they detect are not remediated in the same year.</p><p>As AI enables increasingly sophisticated, large-scale, fast-moving attacks, defenders will need to move faster than ever to keep up. However, millions of individuals are in some fashion responsible for the security of a digital system. Experience shows that we cannot rely on everyone to universally follow best practices, especially given the many practical difficulties that such practices often entail.<sup>22</sup> To prevent AI from enabling a tidal wave of cyberattacks, and in particular to have any practical hope of securing our many critical infrastructure systems against increasingly capable attackers, <strong>we must find ways to shift the playing field</strong>.</p><h2>Mitigation</h2><p>As cyberattacks become even more prevalent and sophisticated, it will be necessary to apply defenses in a more systematic fashion. In this section, we briefly present some potential approaches, with an emphasis on approaches that can leverage AI, asymmetrically benefit defenders, and reduce the burden on individual system operators.</p><h3>Stronger Foundations</h3><p>The best remedy for a security flaw is to prevent the flaw from existing in the first place. Modern coding practices<sup>23</sup> can help reduce the number of exploitable software bugs, but these practices may involve additional effort and/or require rewriting older software. AI-based tools can assist with this work.<sup>24</sup></p><p>Many security breaches owe as much to user error as to software bugs. New technologies such as <a href=\"https://kstatic.googleusercontent.com/files/6a8a4d6536362a2107727b20072f2ab4e853291ce5eb90cc85b6b3b814740639f5d89e964598a63ed62cca4899006d2361cd8caed726b6e4997135a08dba200f\">passkeys</a> eliminate the possibility of users employing weak passwords or being tricked (\u201cphished\u201d) into revealing their password to an attacker.</p><h3>Systematic Defense</h3><p>Rather than relying entirely on overburdened system operators to individually maintain the highest standards of security, we should look for opportunities to supplement security with systematic approaches.</p><p>Attackers perform \u201cvulnerability scans\u201d to locate misconfigured or out-of-date servers, or sensitive information that has accidentally been placed in public view. <strong>If an attacker can find a vulnerability, a defender should be able to find it first</strong>.<sup>25</sup> In particular, we should enable \u201cgood guys\u201d to systematically scan the Internet to identify and remediate vulnerabilities. Realizing this in practice will require addressing a number of practical, organizational, and legal challenges,<sup>26</sup> but companies such as Google are already performing similar activities as a public service.<sup>27</sup> In a related practice, \u201cDark web monitoring\u201d can systematically monitor data leaks if the data appears on the dark web.<sup>28</sup></p><p>Because it is difficult to maintain systems in a state of perfect security, operators often use <strong>firewalls</strong> (which limit access to potentially vulnerable systems), <strong>signature scanning</strong> (watching for known malicious software,<sup>29</sup> as well as known vulnerabilities) and <strong>anomaly detection software</strong> (which looks for unusual access patterns that might indicate a security breach).<sup>30</sup> Cloud computing platforms, software-as-a-service providers, and networking equipment could provide more such functionality. This would facilitate additional, constantly-updated, professionally managed security by default.<sup>31</sup> The introduction of firewalls into PCs and Internet service providers (ISPs) is one of the main reasons that Internet worms like Conficker are no longer prevalent.<sup>32</sup></p><h3>Facilitating Security Patches</h3><p>In a world where the ability of attackers to identify and exploit ever-more-subtle bugs is continually advancing, it is critical that security patches be applied in a timely manner.<sup>33</sup> Unfortunately, as mentioned earlier, this is not always possible. Even if the bug fix itself was small, an entirely new version of the software must be created, tested, and installed \u2013 a significant burden for both the software provider and the user, and possibly subject to regulatory hurdles.</p><p><strong>We must seek out new approaches to software design and distribution that facilitate the application of security patches</strong>,<sup>34</sup> and regulations must be updated to streamline such updates. Solutions must encompass scenarios where a system manufacturer (or one of their suppliers) has gone out of business.</p><h3>Safety Culture</h3><p>Cybersecurity suffers from a lack of transparency. It is difficult to tell which organizations follow good practices; security lapses are often not reported, unless they lead to an outright breach which impacts customers. This reduces the impetus to prioritize cybersecurity, especially because the impact of a breach often falls heavily on third parties. (For instance, when a company fails to secure customer information, it is the customers who are vulnerable to identity theft.)</p><p>Contrast this with the airline industry, where a strict safety culture, including stringent reporting requirements and blameless investigation practices, covering near-misses and procedural failures as well as full-blown accidents, have yielded a remarkable level of safety despite the inherent complexity of air travel.</p><p><strong>Cybersecurity can be enhanced through strict requirements for reporting security lapses</strong>, along with whistleblower provisions to ensure compliance. As in the airline industry, the focus should be on learning from breaches and near-misses, rather than assigning blame.</p><p>Other forms of transparency can create social pressure to adhere to good security practices, including the other measures described here. For instance, rating agencies could be established to evaluate software providers on timeliness of security updates, and cloud operators according to the quality of their internal security and degree of assistance with customer security. Whenever possible, ratings should be based on outcome metrics, rather than adherence to specific practices that might not always correlate with actual security.</p><h3>Responsible Release of Dangerous Capabilities</h3><p>No matter how much we manage to strengthen defenses, we should still attempt to minimize the potential for increasingly advanced AI to assist attackers.</p><p>Many capabilities are \u201cdual-use\u201d, i.e. of value to both attackers and defenders. <strong>The release of new tools that advance such capabilities should follow responsible disclosure policies</strong>, allowing time for vulnerabilities to be patched before attackers gain access. Research into <strong>automatic patching of vulnerabilities</strong> is also called for.</p><p><strong>General-purpose AIs should be designed to refuse requests to assist in cyberattacks</strong>.<sup>35</sup> However, it is difficult to impose such restrictions in a robust manner, especially for open-source models, which is why responsible disclosure is always important.</p><p><strong>Advanced models should be rigorously evaluated to determine whether they provide new capabilities for attackers</strong>. Release of such a model should be delayed until defensive measures can be updated (for example, release of advances in bug detection should be delayed until they can be applied in private to widely used software packages, and any issues found have been fixed and the patches deployed widely).</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Virtually every aspect of modern life, from the operations of corporations large and small to critical energy, transportation, water, and other infrastructure, rely on systems that are vulnerable to cyberattack. By default, progress will leave us open to devastating attacks, as attackers will quickly make use of new AI capabilities but defenders often lag behind. Our current sense of relative security depends in part on the reluctance of state-level actors to cause visible damage, but as AI provides leverage to smaller actors, this \u201ccyberattack overhang\u201d could translate into startling consequences.</p><p>To mitigate this danger, we must regulate development of, and access to, AIs with dangerous capabilities. However, this cannot be our only line of defense. Legacy software must migrate to modern, safe coding practices; we must shift responsibility for security from individual system operators to professional organizations; we must move away from the assumption that all systems can be frequently updated with security patches. This will require coordinated efforts across the entire technology sector. The advent of advanced AI must be our wake-up call to finally address long-standing issues in our approach to cybersecurity.</p><hr><p><i>Guest author Steve Newman, a co-founder of eight startups including Google Docs (n\u00e9e Writely), is now searching for ways to reduce the tension between progress and safety by building a more robust world.

Advances in AI might help distinguish genuine attacks from noise.</p><p>Conversely, AI may also help attackers to camouflage their behavior by imitating normal usage.

Formal verification of complex systems is impractical today, but AI may eventually change this.</p><p>Of course, it is an oversimplification to say that no attacker could ever possibly breach a formally verified system. There could be flaws in the specification, in which case formal verification merely ensures that the system faithfully follows the incorrect specification. The system could be subverted by an authorized user, who might be coerced or tricked into taking inappropriate actions. There are side-channel attacks that lie outside the scope of formal verification, and so forth. Still, it seems plausible that powerful AI, <i>if vigorously applied to improve security</i>, could shift the balance in favor of defense. For instance, AIs could help review specifications and detect suspicious behavior by unauthorized users.</p><p><strong>19.</strong>This idea is inspired by a comment made by Trail of Bits CEO Dan Guido during a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RM4Gag7TIYo\">presentation</a> at the Technical Advisory Committee of the Commodity Futures Trading Commision.</p><p>Defenders have access to large amounts of internal monitoring data.

There are many complicating factors, such as the potential for accidentally blocking legitimate usage. However, there are success stories, such as Cloudflare\u2019s cybersecurity features or the Windows Defender firewall enabled by default on computers running Microsoft Windows.</p><p><strong>32.</strong>Note that firewalls are by no means a panacea. Network traffic increasingly uses encryption, which is a very good thing, but makes it harder for firewalls (and anomaly detection systems) to have a clear picture. Also, firewalls are often placed only at the periphery of a network, leaving the interior systems vulnerable if an attacker is able to gain access to a single weak-link system somewhere inside. Thus, it is important to find ways to deploy these tools so that they are able to observe and protect activity at a detailed level, including internal communications within an organization\u2019s network. At the same time, such tools then represent an extremely juicy target for hackers; extreme care must be taken to ensure that the security tools themselves are not vulnerable to breaches, and also to ensure that the sensitive information they observe is not collected or logged in ways that would make it vulnerable to privacy breaches or abuse by central authorities.</p><p><strong>33.</strong>One benefit of cloud offerings, such as software-as-a-service and infrastructure-as-a-service, is that software upgrades are generally not the responsibility of individual customers.</p><p><strong>34.</strong>See, for instance, <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2019-10-14\">Rapidly Patching Legacy Software Vulnerabilities in Mission-Critical Systems</a>.</p><p><strong>35.</strong>At least, outside of verified legitimate use cases, such as penetration testing.</p><p>\u200d</p>", "user": {"username": "Center for AI Safety"}}, {"_id": "RytwXqF6NkkMQn7J4", "title": "Are we probably in the middle of humanity?

What are the odds that we'd just happen to live among the first 1/10^38th of people who will ever exist? Similarly, should we be skeptical of claims that humanity is ending in the next few years, which would suggest we're among the last 5% of all humans?</p><p>If you don't really buy this sort of reasoning to begin with, here's an example of its usefulness. During World War II, the Allies wanted to determine how rapidly Germany was making tanks. After discovering that the serial numbers on German tank parts were sequentially numbered (e.g., 1, 2, 3...) some Allied statisticians <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_tank_problem#Historical_example_of_the_problem\">obtained surprisingly accurate estimates of the speed of German tank production by looking at the numbers on just 2 captured tanks</a>. (For example, if they'd have seen the numbers 1012 and 1041 on the different tanks, they'd have been very surprised to learn the Germans were pumping out 500 tanks a day.)</p><p>Of course, this example doesn't exactly mirror my question - I'm not interested in how fast new people are being brought into existence, but <i>where in the complete distribution of people over time we are most likely to be.</i> Answering this question would also tell us something about how many people we should expect to ever exist, and vice versa. Another way my question differs is this: In contemplating how many total people are likely to exist, we can only rely on <i>one</i> observation - our own consciousness - because this is the only plausibly random sample of humanity available to us. Unlike statisticians inspecting tanks, we cannot assume the people we encounter are an unbiased, random subset of all humans who will ever exist, since our sampling process is confounded by our unfortunate access to only the past and the present. But despite these differences, it still feels like a clever Bayesian might be able to use the knowledge that they\u2019re the 120-billionth person as some kind of evidence about the total number of people who will ever live. Right?</p><p><strong>Two competing perspectives:</strong></p><p>One perspective says that regardless of the number of total people who will ever exist, the odds of being any particular person in that universe are equally likely. If you generate a random number between 1 and 100, you shouldn't be any more surprised if you get 1 than if you get 50 - each had a 1% chance. The same goes if you generate a number between 1 and 1 trillion: getting 1 shouldn't be any more surprising than getting 4,011,218,693. According to this perspective, we should be totally agnostic about how many people should exist, since regardless of the answer, our existence at the present point in humanity's timeline is not surprising.</p><p>But a second perspective says that our sole observation of consciousness around the 120-billion-people mark <i>can</i> tell us about the <i>relative likelihood of competing views</i> about humanity's lifespan. Suppose I bring you a bag full of green and red balls and have you draw one. It's red. Then I tell you the bag either had 1 red ball and 4 green balls, or 1 red ball and 499 green balls (uh, it's a magic Mary Poppins bag, so you really couldn\u2019t tell how many total balls were in there). Which seems more plausible - that there were 5 total balls and you drew the 1/5 chance red ball, or that there were 500 balls and you drew the 1/500 chance red ball? Similarly, the second anthropic perspective asserts that our existence at T + 120 billion humans is evidence that 240 billion total humans ever living is a lot more likely than 10^50 humans ever living, as in the former scenario our particular observation takes up a larger total proportion of the probability space<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"v4cafuwub08\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefv4cafuwub08\"><sup><a href=\"#fnv4cafuwub08\">[1]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>In thinking about this question, I came up with 5 thought experiments that I think get progressively closer to accurately modeling the right way to think about this question. In these analogies, God creates some number of boxes (aka people who you might have wound up being), and depending on the way you frame her randomization/box-creation process, which of the above perspectives you should take seems to differ.</p><p><strong>1. Box Before Universe</strong></p><p>God tells you there are ten boxes. When you fall asleep, she'll randomly put you in one of them. Then, she'll flip a coin. If it's tails, she'll make another 999,999,999,990 boxes.</p><p>You wake up in box 3.&nbsp;</p><p>In this scenario, you\u2019re clueless about God's coin toss, obviously. Whether or not she created the additional boxes, the odds of you being in box 3 are the same. If you don\u2019t think the universe is deterministic, you might think that this is a good analogy for the universe, as our relative position in humanity\u2019s larger lifespan isn\u2019t \u201cset\u201d in any sense before we\u2019re born. Perhaps the number of people of people who will ever exist is constantly changing, and we\u2019re regularly affecting this number by making decisions. But if you agree with me that determinism is true (or you at least think it's possible to predict things), then you\u2019re probably similarly dissatisfied with this first thought experiment. <i>There is and has always been some fact of the matter about how many people will ever exist,</i> and so this analogy falls short.</p><p><strong>2. Universe Before Box</strong></p><p>God tells you she's going to flip a coin. If it's heads, she'll randomly put you in one of ten boxes numbered 1-10. If it's tails, she'll randomly put you in one of ten trillion boxes numbered 1-10,000,000,000,000. You wake up in box 3.&nbsp;</p><p>In this scenario, the odds of waking up in box 3 if God\u2019s coin landed heads are 1/10. The odds of waking up in box 3 if God\u2019s coin landed tails are 1/10,000,000,000,000. Therefore, by Bayes theorem, the odds of heads given that you woke up in box 3 are one-trillion-to-one. I think you should be confident the coin came up heads<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"2\" data-footnote-id=\"ixupvsgq0z8\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefixupvsgq0z8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnixupvsgq0z8\">[2]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>Similarly, assuming there is a fact-of-the-matter about how many people will exist, perhaps our \u201cbox number\u201d can justifiably inform our evaluation of competing claims about humanity\u2019s lifespan. But this scenario doesn\u2019t really feel complete: there are clearly more possibilities than only 10 or 10 trillion people ever living - what happens when we try to consider <i>all the numbers</i>? The following three thought experiments try to answer this.</p><p><strong>3. Smiteful God 1.0</strong></p><p>God tells you there are ten boxes. She'll randomly put you in one of them, but you won\u2019t be able to see the number. She will smite box 1 on day 1, smite box 2 on day 2, and so on. On day 3, after God smites the third box, you find yourself still alive and wonder how many days you have left to live.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point, you could be in box 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or 10, meaning you\u2019ll live four more days on average. But the fact that three boxes have been smitten so far tells you nothing about which box you\u2019re in (besides that you obviously weren\u2019t in those ones).</p><p>I included this scenario to acknowledge that knowing you <i>aren\u2019t</i> in other boxes doesn\u2019t work as evidence about which remaining box you <i>are</i> in, even in this problematic analogy where you do somehow know the total number of boxes that exist. But as the next two experiments will demonstrate, knowing you weren\u2019t one of these numbers <i>is</i> still useful evidence if you modify this experiment to incorporate the broader question about how many boxes (or people) to expect to be in a universe in the first place. And once we answer this question, determining our relative position within that universe is much easier.</p><p><strong>4. Smiteful God 2.0</strong></p><p>God tells you she\u2019s going to flip a coin. If it's heads, she'll randomly put you in one of ten boxes numbered 1-10. If it's tails, she'll randomly put you in one of ten trillion boxes numbered 1-10,000,000,000,000. In either case, you won\u2019t be able to see the number. She will smite box 1 on day 1, smite box 2 on day 2, and so on. On day 9, after God smites the ninth box, you find yourself still alive and wonder how many days you have left to live.&nbsp;</p><p>The odds of surviving day 9 if God\u2019s coin landed heads are 1/10. The odds of surviving day 9 if God\u2019s coin landed tails are 9,999,999,999,999,991/10,000,000,000,000,000. Therefore, by Bayes theorem, the odds the coin landed heads given you survived day 9 are nearly ten-to-one. You should be quite confident the coin came up heads<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"3\" data-footnote-id=\"3jcq2dc4hob\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3jcq2dc4hob\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3jcq2dc4hob\">[3]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>As in the second thought experiment, when you use your observed number to evaluate which of two possible universes you are in, it becomes much clearer that your observed number is relevant information. Finally: what happens if you extend this thinking to compare not two, but infinitely many possible hypotheses about how many boxes/people might exist?</p><p><strong>5. Smiteful God 3.0</strong></p><p>God tells you she\u2019s going to pick some number N. Then she\u2019ll create N boxes and put you in a random one of them. She will smite box 1 on day 1, box 2 on day 2, and blah blah blah you get the point. Three days pass and your existential dread is unbearable.</p><p>View one: You have no clue when you\u2019re gonna die. All you know is that it\u2019s 3 days less than whatever it was 3 days ago. On average, you will live (N - 3) / 2 more days, and without knowing N you can\u2019t know shit. Even if God chose 4 and it was improbable that you would make it here, there\u2019s no way of knowing that, and you have no reason to suspect she chose to make 10 trillion boxes over 4 boxes or any other number. Just like in Smiteful God 1.0, the fact that three boxes have been smitten so far gives you no new information about which box you\u2019re in.</p><p>View two: Suppose that instead of telling you she was going to choose any number, God said she was going to choose some power of 10 up to 10 trillion (could be 10, 100, 1,000, etc.). Then, you would have started with some complicated prior expectation about how many years you would live, but each time a box gets smited and you aren\u2019t in it, the odds she chose 10 decrease and the odds she chose something above your prior expectation increase, as in experiment 4. Thus, with each successive smite, your expectation about how much longer you have to live should increase.</p><p>This same logic would apply if God told you she was going to choose any individual number up to 10 trillion, or 10^100, or something way bigger. On view one, because you don\u2019t know N, updating it in any way feels unreasonable. But on view two, for any number God chose as the maximum value she <i>could</i> have generated, the rational response would be to update your expectation of N\u2019s value slightly upwards each time you wake up. In fact, God doesn\u2019t even have to tell you what the maximum number of boxes she might have chosen is: It need only be the case that there exists such a maximum number.</p><p>And so: The objection that we cannot update N since we\u2019re completely clueless about it is actually an infinity-breaking-logic-type objection in disguise. As long as we accept that there is some fact-of-the-matter about how long human history could possibly be (e.g., it won\u2019t be longer than the length of time from the big bang until the heat death of the universe), our prior expectation should be that we are not near the very beginning nor end of human existence. We should also increase our expectation of humanity\u2019s total lifespan as time goes on.&nbsp;</p><p>This prior belief should of course be influenced by other evidence and I\u2019m not sure how resilient/malleable it should be - possibly this sort of consideration is easily outweighed by our observations about technological progress, space travel, etc. But in any case, we should be (at least marginally) more receptive to the idea that humanity will end soon (which would mean we\u2019re in the last 5% of people and is not so unreasonable on priors) than that there will be 10^50 more humans (which would mean we\u2019re in the first <strong>1/10^38th</strong> [.000000000000000000000000000000000000001%] of people<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"4\" data-footnote-id=\"grdn40bb9l\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgrdn40bb9l\"><sup><a href=\"#fngrdn40bb9l\">[4]</a></sup></span>).</p><p>The universe has already flipped the metaphorical coins to determine the total number of people who will exist.

As long as we believe there is a true, finite answer to the question, \u201chow many people will ever exist,\u201d we should theoretically be able to lay out all possible numbers of people who could exist and view them as competing hypotheses. Assuming we\u2019re completely uncertain, we can assign each number an equal chance to start. Low numbers (120 billion being the minimum) look implausible simply because there are a ton of higher numbers the answer could be. Super high numbers also look implausible because the odds of drawing 120 billion from a bag with numbers 1 through N become increasingly slim as N approaches infinity. The answer which minimizes both kinds of surprise is N = 2X (where X is the number of people who have lived so far)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"5\" data-footnote-id=\"rfrlvhgcp3p\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrfrlvhgcp3p\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrfrlvhgcp3p\">[5]</a></sup></span>, suggesting that we should assume we\u2019re living in the middle of humanity by default.</p><ol class=\"footnote-section footnotes\" data-footnote-section=\"\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"v4cafuwub08\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnv4cafuwub08\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"v4cafuwub08\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefv4cafuwub08\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>By this logic, why is it not the case that 120 billion is more plausible than 240 billion, and we should assume we\u2019re right at the end? 1/120b is more likely than 1/240b, right?

Speed is the difference between success and failure. The quicker you react, the smaller the outbreak will be at the time, and the easier it will be to bring it under control. The slower you react, the less likely you are to ever see the end of it, as the Covid-19 pandemic showed. Building speed into national pandemic response plans should therefore be a priority for pandemic policy-makers worldwide.</p><p>The speed of your response is determined by two factors: how long it takes you to identify the pathogen (reaction speed) and how quickly you can implement and complete your plan (execution speed). We will need significant improvements in both areas if we are to protect the world from the most dangerous pathogens. Fortunately, significant improvements to both are achievable, as outlined below.</p><p>This post will take the form of a compare / contrast exercise. It will first present a typical timeline of an outbreak as it grows from a single infection into a wider regional epidemic, noting the major milestones along the way. It will then consider an alternative timeline, in which speed has been prioritised in the outbreak response. The first timeline represents the current approach to pandemic risk management in most western countries, and the second is an optimistic vision of where we could be 10 years from now. This exercise should help us to identify where time could be saved and how it could be done.</p><p>We will finish by summarising the key lessons: the policies that can improve our reaction and execution times, the resources needed to do so, the tools and techniques currently available to us, and the innovations that might help. If we can learn these lessons and make these changes, we will have gone a long way towards making pandemic risk a thing of the past.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>The Timeline of a Pandemic</h1><h3>Timepoint 0: First Infection</h3><p>The outbreak begins with Patient 0. This is first person to be infected by this novel pandemic-potential pathogen ('PPP'). We won\u2019t know when that has happened, and we\u2019ll probably never know who Patient 0 was, but this is the literal beginning of the outbreak, and the clock is now ticking. The first infection leads to a second and then a third. The PPP is now spreading in the community and some people start to notice flu-like symptoms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Timepoint 1: First GP Visit</h3><p>At Timepoint 1, someone feels sick enough to consult their GP. This will happen a couple of weeks after the initial infection. The GP, seeing the flu-like symptoms, will suggest that the patient go home and get some rest. Perhaps the patient recovers over the next few days, or perhaps their symptoms deteriorate and a further consultation will be required. Either way, the PPP has been given more time to spread in the local community and beyond.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Timepoint 2: First Hospital Admission</h3><p>The next major milestone occurs when the first patient goes to a hospital. At this stage it is still assumed that the patient is suffering from a bad flu or something else \u2018normal\u2019. The patient will probably be older too, so these kinds of cases are to be expected. The hospital will continue to monitor the patient\u2019s condition over the next few days. Hopefully by then they\u2019ll be through the worst of it and can be discharged, and perhaps that is what will happen. In the meantime however, the PPP continues to spread. We are 3 or 4 weeks into the outbreak, and the pathogen has passed along national transport networks and is likely present in all major cities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Timepoint 3: First ICU Patient</h3><p>By now, we are a month or so into the outbreak and there will be several patients in hospital suffering from this mysterious pneumonia. They won\u2019t all recover. At Timepoint 3, one of these patients will be admitted to the ICU. This is usually the first time that the patient will be tested for the pathogens which are most likely to be the cause of their disease \u2013 the influenza viruses, rhinoviruses, RSVs, HPIVs, SARS-CoV-2, bacterial infections, and maybe even the more exotic pathogens like SARS. When they all come back negative, the doctors will scratch their heads. But, that is probably all they will do. While there may be only a handful of cases in the hospitals at the current juncture, the seeds of a much larger outbreak have already been sown.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Timepoint 4: First Death</h3><p>At Timepoint 4, which would be 4 to 8 weeks into the outbreak, the first person will die from this novel PPP. Most likely it was one of the ICU patients. With other patients in the ICU and several more in the hospital, more deaths will soon follow. Despite the mystery surrounding the cause of death, it still may not be clear to the medics that there is something anomalous, as the symptoms aren\u2019t much different to the symptoms of the other less-dangerous diseases they see every day. It may take several more deaths before the medics and officials initiate a more formal investigation of the matter. By now, the pathogen has likely crossed international borders. Depending on the proximity of the initial outbreak to major travel hubs, the pathogen may have spread to multiple countries but, since no one is even aware that it exists, there is no way of knowing where it is or how far it has spread.</p><p>This outbreak will surely go on to become a regional epidemic and, with no immediate response in sight and all the momentum on its side, a pandemic seems likely.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>The Timeline: Commentary</h3><p>By the time the first person dies from this novel PPP, at least a month has passed since the initial infection, and it could be a few more weeks before someone suggests that these mysterious pneumonia cases might be connected. If the outbreak started overseas and there have been reports of mysterious cases abroad, that should happen sooner.&nbsp;Otherwise, or until then, the PPP will continue to spread from person to person, from community to community, and from country to country.</p><p>But even if the medics did act immediately on their earliest suspicions, the outbreak would continue to grow because there\u2019s still no way to identify the pathogen. It will take several more weeks again for samples to be taken, genomes to be sequenced, tests to be designed and approved, and then manufactured and distributed in bulk. And that assumes that the politicians don\u2019t get in the way and slow things down.</p><p>All told, it could easily be 2 or 3 months from the time of the initial infection until the novel PPP has been identified, tests have been manufactured, and a comprehensive response can even begin. If the outbreak is growing by a factor of 2 every week, then a 3-month head start translates to about 8,000 cases. If it\u2019s growing by a factor of 3 (as Covid-19 was early on) then it will be more like 1.5 million cases!</p><p>We cannot chase down an outbreak of 1.5million cases, so we cannot afford to give novel PPPs such a big head start. If we are to permanently protect humanity from these threats, it is essential that we respond to the risk sooner.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>So, let\u2019s consider how we might do that\u2026</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><u>An Alternative Timeline of a Pandemic</u></h1><h3><u>Timepoint 0: First Infection</u></h3><p>I don\u2019t have anything to say about how to prevent the initial infection. And that\u2019s not because there\u2019s nothing to say about the sources of these threats, be it high-risk research, lab leaks, bioterrorism, climate change, or anything else. There\u2019s plenty to be said, but others are more qualified to do so and I have nothing to say that they cannot. My priority is to develop a robust pandemic response framework that can protect us from any pathogen, no matter how dangerous it is, and wherever it comes from. So I take the first infection as given, and focus instead on our actions from that point on.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><u>Timepoint 1: First GP Visit</u></h3><p>The GP assumed that the patient was infected with something typical or common, but what if he didn\u2019t have to assume? What if he could have tested the patient to establish exactly which pathogen it was? If the patient tests positive for one the usual pathogens that cause colds, seasonal influenzas, and other common Winter ailments diagnosis, it will provide clarity and may inform the course of treatment. But what if all those tests come back negative? That wouldn\u2019t <i>prove</i> that there is a novel pathogen on the loose, but it would be a warning sign and perhaps grounds for further investigation. The GP may not change the course of treatment, but he should inform the relevant infectious disease departments within the national health service. As more people get infected and go to their GPs, more of them will produce negative test results and the warning signs will accumulate.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><u>Timepoint 2: First Hospital Admission</u></h3><p>The hospital should be able to run all the same tests as the GP (assuming they hadn\u2019t been done already) plus more again for the rarer pathogens: the nosocomial diseases, Legionnaires\u2019, TB, H5N1, H7N9, SARS or MERS. Given that the patient is infected with a novel pathogen, these tests will also come back negative. With this additional information, the risk of a novel pathogen grows. The national health service should be informed of these negative test results, and it should update its pandemic readiness levels (eg like DEFCON 1 in US defence readiness). GP surgeries around the country should be informed and on the lookout for more cases. Senior hospital staff should have conversations about readying spare capacity.</p><p>The hospital should also take a sample of this mystery pathogen and keep it in storage for a few months. If a novel PPP is subsequently discovered, they can go back to the stored samples and retest them, some of which will surely be positive. This will help us to understand when the pathogen first entered the country, it will give us early genomes and other information to add to the global dataset, and it will help us to backward trace the outbreak so that we can find current cases and suppress transmission.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><u>Timepoint 3: First ICU Patient</u></h3><p>By the time the first patient arrives in the ICU, the alarm bells should already be ringing in the nation\u2019s health service. Many patients with severe symptoms will have produced negative test results, and with a patient now in the ICU, it is possible that this novel pathogen could be very dangerous.</p><p>Pandemic risk management plans should be in operation and protective measures should be increased again (eg DEFCON 2 or 3). If there has been a lot of testing and sampling as described above, then there should be plenty of data for outbreak investigators to work with, and they can start putting the pieces together.</p><p>If there have been reports of mystery cases abroad, then both the national health service and the government should be in regular contact with all the major global health organisations as well as governments in the affected regions to gather additional information and update their plans accordingly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><u>Timepoint 4: First Death</u></h3><p>By the time the first person dies from this novel pathogen, the national pandemic risk management response should be well under way and it may already be having some effects on transmission. Medical stockpiles should be accessed, the public should be aware of the threat, and the health service should be expanding capacity wherever it could be needed (eg DEFCON 3 or 4). Depending on the information-flow from the rest of the world, the leaders may know what the pathogen is and they may even be able to test for it. If so, tests should be acquired and performed in great volume to find the pathogen wherever it may be and chains of transmission should be traced and cut.</p><p>From there, the domestic plan continues until the pathogen is eliminated and the global outbreak is conclusively and officially over. If everything has gone to plan at home and abroad, this shouldn\u2019t take more than a few months. Nor should it require any serious impact on day-to-day civilian life.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><u>An Alternative Timeline: Commentary</u></h3><p>In the original timeline, the first GP visit and the first hospital admission illicit no response from the public health authorities. These events are the first pieces of evidence pointing us to the existence of a novel pathogen, but we are effectively deaf to the warnings. We have no way to recognise that information because we have no way to test for it. It is only when a patient needs the ICU that a novel pathogen becomes a possibility.</p><p>In the alternative timeline we are doing more testing, and though we still can\u2019t identify the pathogen itself, we can whittle down the possibilities, which brings the risk of a novel pathogen into consideration \u2013 if it\u2019s not one of the most common viruses, then what is it? This question initiates our national pandemic response.</p><p>The increase in testing is a key difference between these two timelines. By bringing testing out of hospitals and into the community (bringing it \u2018upstream\u2019) we are getting more information and sooner. In the original timeline, a 3-month headstart translated to 1.5 million cases. If we can cut that head start in half, we can reduce the number of cases to a thousand or so \u2013 an eminently solvable problem.</p><p>In pandemic risk management, speed makes the impossible, probable.</p><p>So testing reduces our reaction time, but we still have to react with something, and that is the other key difference between the two scenarios. In the original timeline, the medics only&nbsp;started scratching their heads when the first person entered the ICU, and even when the first person died there was still no public health response. The warnings signs were there, but they had no plans in place.</p><p>In order to respond quickly and effectively to these threats, we need a tiered risk management plan with higher levels of preparedness and protection at each ascending tier (like the USA\u2019s DEFCON system). We define the key \u2018trigger\u2019 events which prompt us to move from one tier to the next, so that as the risks increase, our defences increase with them.</p><p>The alternative timeline demonstrates the benefits of such a system.</p><p>The first patient who shows up to their GP with mystery disease is the first warning sign, and that should be officially recorded by some part of the national health system. It may not justify a public health response just yet, but it should be noted and accessible for further investigation.</p><p>When the first patient is admitted to a hospital with a mystery case, having had just about every possible test done, that\u2019s when the initial public health response should be triggered. As more mystery cases are observed in community and start showing up in hospitals, that would be another trigger to raise the preparedness levels again. By the time the first patient enters the ICU, the public health response would already be well under way, and the ramping up of defensive measures may have already started to slow the outbreak.</p><p>By this stage the global response will have started too so tests and other key resources should be flooding the few 'hot zones' and smothering the outbreaks there. The rest of the world will remain vigilant until victory is declared.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the following sections, I will summarise the key lessons from this compare / contrast exercise by listing the policy options available to us now to improve the speed of our pandemic response plans.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><u>Building Speed in Reaction</u></h1><p>In order to cut our reaction time to these kinds of threats, we need to do more testing. TINA. The more we test, the sooner we\u2019ll find the anomalies, and the sooner we can begin our risk management response.</p><p>We should aim to bring as much testing as possible upstream and into the community. It should be easy for members of the public to get tested for common viruses, whether that is in their GP\u2019s surgery, at local health care facilities, or even at pop-up testing facilities in shopping centres and other venues. We want to keep the test turnaround time short too so that people get their results back quickly and can take action if needed. Waiting until the first patients are in the ICU is too little too late.</p><p>We should look to introduce &amp;/ expand forms of surveillance testing which can test large numbers of people in one go. Sewerage and wastewater testing would be prime examples. These methods allow us test whole communities and neighbourhoods for the presence of diseases, without having to test any (much less <i>every</i>) person individually. Environmental sampling, say of buses or trains at the end of their routes, would be another example. Surveillance testing at major airports and other ports of entry will help us to identify and suppressing international spread, and this will be key for pandemic prevention.</p><p>We don\u2019t <i>need</i> innovation in testing technology because our current tools and resources are sufficient. However, technological progress is always welcome. The areas where innovation might have the most impact include:</p><ol><li>Developing new testing methods that are cheaper or quicker, or that otherwise make testing more accessible, for example by making the test simple enough to be used by the public</li><li>Expanding current test production capacity \u2013 in general and excess emergency capacity \u2013 and distributing it around the world so that there are no monopolies or choke points</li><li>Shortening the process from the genome being sequenced, the test being designed, the test being approved, and it being manufactured and distributed to the world</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><u>Building Speed in Execution</u></h1><p>Our response to the pathogen \u2013 whether national or global \u2013 will depend on many factors that are beyond the scope of this essay, for example, national goals, national risk assessments and priorities, or the potential for international co-ordination. So I won\u2019t say much here about the plans themselves. Instead, I will discuss some of the tools and methods that can improve the speed and quality of any pandemic response plan, regardless of its goal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><u>Table-Top Exercises / War-Gaming</u></h3><p>We need to get the right people in the room at the same time to work through realistic pandemic scenarios. This will help us to develop high-level plans and to explore potential risks. Table-top exercises are cheap and easy, and a great way to get people together and talking to each other. They can also be more complex and realistic if needs be. We already do exercises and war games for contagious disease, which is good, but we should do more of them and we need to target novel PPP risk.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><u>Real-World Exercise and Drills</u></h3><p>We can run real-world exercises and drills to get some real-world practice and familiarity, to identify weaknesses, and to sharpen our responses. These drills can be done on a small scale within individual facilities or departments, or they can be larger exercises which take place over several days across multiple departments and facilities, and can even involve members of the public as actors. Like table-top exercises, we already do some real-world exercises and drills, but we need a more structured approach and we need to prepare for the worst-case scenarios.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><u>Medical Stockpiles</u></h3><p>Medical stockpiles ensure that we have essential resources available at short notice. Those key resources include masks, PPE, multi-purpose medicines and therapeutics, and various vaccines (smallpox, H1N1, etc). At the slightest hint of danger, these resources can be distributed to every part of the country to protect from the initial shock. All nations should have stockpiles of medical resources to maximise the effect of their epidemic responses (as well as for general risk management purposes). We don\u2019t want to be waiting on key resources in an emergency as that will cost lives. Equally, we don\u2019t want our national risk management responses to be dependent on the global supply chain.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><u>Data Storage &amp; Communication</u></h3><p>We need to establish domestic systems to store key information. For example, we need a database of mysterious cases to monitor risks and a storage facility for mystery samples so they can be retested when a novel PPP is confirmed. This will help us to understand the pathogen and track down the outbreak. We also need to establish international agreements to ensure that information will be communicated to the world in full and in a timely manner. For example, the pathogen\u2019s genome is needed to design and produce tests. This is an essential piece of information and it is essential that it is supplied to the world as soon as possible.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><u>Goals and Plans</u></h3><p>Most important of all, we need to have goals for our pandemic responses, and we need to have plans to achieve them. This includes setting the trigger events which will initiate different parts of the plan, as well as the policy responses which should follow. Any plan is better than no plan. Once we have established a beta version, we can develop it through exercises, stress tests, and drills. Without even a sketch of a plan however, there is little we can do as we have nothing to work with.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>Speed is the most important variable in outbreak control. Speed is the difference between throwing a fire blanket over a pan fire and ordering take-away, versus watching your home and everything you own go up in flames. The sooner we find the pathogen, the sooner we can respond to it. The better our plans, the faster we can end the threat.</p><p>In contrast, the slower we respond to the outbreak, and the more time we spend standing around, scratching our heads, looking for someone to give us guidance, the more damage the pathogen will do and the less likely we are to ever eliminate it.

This is useful, as without some framework along these lines it is difficult to choose one intervention over another, as different interventions reduce suffering of differing intensities, and we don't know the correct way tradeoff between high intensity suffering and low intensity suffering. However, that system does not help us in deciding between two interventions which are both in the Pareto frontier, i.e. it can help us find the set of best interventions, but not the best of the best, which is what we\u2019re ultimately looking for.</p>\n<p>This post describes a system which is useful for comparing interventions within the Pareto frontier. The basic idea is we have two interventions, A and B, and we know how many hours of each pain-intensity they are expected to reduce and how much they are expected to cost, and we want to know which is more cost effective. We can\u2019t calculate their relative cost-effectiveness directly, as this depends on the total expected pain reduction, which in turn depends on the pain-intensity-weighting. Instead, we will let the weighting range across all possible values and see the resulting range of relative cost-effectiveness. So we will end up with a statement something like: <em>\u201cA is between 80% as effective, and 200% more cost effective than B\u201d</em>. Along with some heuristics, we can use this to build up some confidence about which intervention is most cost-effective.</p>\n<p>The maths of how this works is discussed in Appendix 1, but for now I will go straight into how this can be used in practice</p>\n<h1>How this can be used</h1>\n<h2>Step by Step</h2>\n<p>Here are the steps to follow when given a list of interventions and the aim is to choose the one which is most cost-effective.</p>\n<h3>Step 1: Plot the interventions on a pain-dimension plot, adjusted for cost</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hdTeZsAC7ybwXvEXa/qmwzh9wbxuzjpn7z55mn\" alt=\"\">\nFigure 1: The interventions plotted according to their reductions in pain of differing intensities, adjusted for cost</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Where the x axis signifies the reduction in high intensity pain, and the y axis is the reduction for low intensity pain.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Step 2: Use CPF-MOO to find the Pareto frontier</h3>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/hdTeZsAC7ybwXvEXa/rg7gvvkmay4rwv278bss\" alt=\"\">\nFigure 2: The pareto frontier found with CPF-MOO shown in red</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The process (discussed <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TjTasqnEzmsTKyjhh/frontiers-of-pain-the-cumulative-pain-framework-and-multi\">here</a> in detail) guarantees that the Pareto frontier (consisting of the two points [6, 2], and [4, 5], shown in red) reduce more pain than any of the blue points, with no knowledge of the weighting between high and low intensity pain.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Step 3: For each pair of interventions in the Pareto frontier, see how they compare at the two extreme weights</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>When comparing between two interventions, we care about 3 key things:\n<ul>\n<li>How much better A is than B when the weighting between high intensity pain and low intensity pain (denoted by <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\beta\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-mi\"><span class=\"mjx-char MJXc-TeX-math-I\" style=\"padding-top: 0.519em;

E.g. an intervention which enables caged hens to live in a cage-free warehouse, where both of these conditions cause the hens different kinds of pain. To judge how effective an intervention is, we need to know the difference between the pains caused by these situations. The pain event of the status quo is labelled <span class=\"mjpage\"><span class=\"mjx-chtml\"><span class=\"mjx-math\" aria-label=\"\\vec{E}_0\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\" aria-hidden=\"true\"><span class=\"mjx-msubsup\"><span class=\"mjx-base\"><span class=\"mjx-texatom\"><span class=\"mjx-mrow\"><span class=\"mjx-munderover\"><span class=\"mjx-stack\"><span class=\"mjx-over\" style=\"height: 0.248em;

Positive results include characterizations of core social preference relations with which any relation satisfying desirable properties must be compatible, as well as overtaking criteria, asymptotic criteria, averaging criteria, hyperreal criteria, and criteria that focus on the worst-off.</p>", "user": {"username": "Jobst Heitzig (vodle.it)"}}, {"_id": "pH3hgyisiPH4H3wRC", "title": "Claude vs GPT", "postedAt": "2024-03-14T12:44:11.805Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Ever since ChatGPT released to the public I have used LLMs every day. GPT-4 was essential in getting me up and running at my job where I had to read and edit pieces of Python, SQL, Unix, and Stata code with little to no prior experience. Beyond coding I\u2019ve had some success using GPT to collect links and sources. For writing, GPT\u2019s only use is translating terse bullet points into polite emails and producing blog post drafts so terrible that I forget my writer\u2019s block and rush to correct it.</p><p>The worst part about GPT is its personality. It is a lazy, lying, moralist midwit. Everything it writes is full of nauseating cliche and it frequently refuses to do something you know it can do. Most of these disabilities were tacked on to GPT as part of the reinforcement learning which tamed the fascinating LLM shoggoth into an intermittently useful, helpful harmless sludge which never says anything bad.</p><p>This made me suspicious of Anthropic\u2019s models. This company was founded by safety-<a href=\"https://research.contrary.com/reports/anthropic\"><u>concerned offshoots of OpenAI who left</u></a> after the for profit arm of OpenAI was created and GPT-2 was open sourced despite the grave dangers it posed to the world. Their explicit mission is to advance the frontier of AI safety without advancing capabilities so I figured their models would have all of the safetyist annoyances of GPT without any of the usefulness.</p><p>Claude Opus proved me wrong. For the past week, every time I asked GPT something I asked Claude the same question. The biggest advantage Claude has over GPT is a more concise writing style. Claude gets to the point quickly and it usually gets it right. Even though writing isn\u2019t the main task I use LLMs for, this advantage is massive. All of GPT\u2019s extra fluff sentences add up to a frustrating experience even when you\u2019re just coding.</p><p>Claude can\u2019t search the web, but it\u2019s still better at serving up relevant links than GPT for anything within its training window. Claude\u2019s code is high quality, though GPT is also strong here and I only have enough experience to evaluate R code.</p><h3>GPT\u2019s Remaining Moat</h3><p>GPT still has several features that Claude can\u2019t match. The biggest gap is image generation.

We care about making the biggest difference in the world. That is why we do not take any equity, ask for board seats, or hamstring your company's growth in any other way. Instead, we ask that participants&nbsp;<strong>commit to donating a minimum of 50% of their personal exit earnings above $1m</strong> to effective charities, similar to what the signatories of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.founderspledge.com/\"><u>Founders Pledge</u></a> or the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://givingpledge.org/\"><u>Giving Pledge</u></a> are doing.<br><br>Many established, highly impactful charities (in particular global health charities) have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2022/07/05/update-on-givewells-funding-projections/\"><u>significant room to absorb more funding effectively</u></a>. New effective charities can have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cjH2puDzAFrtrrThQ/despite-billions-of-extra-funding-small-donors-can-still\"><u>significant funding gaps</u></a>, too, which may prevent them from scaling up and improving the lives of millions. That is why the funds you will raise could have a huge impact.</p><h1><strong>Is this a good fit for you</strong></h1><p>If you\u2019re excited by the entrepreneurial career path, look to find or refine your business idea, if you have not found the right co-founder, or if you want to test out for-profit entrepreneurship as a path to make a massive positive difference - this program is for you.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We look for:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>People that want to make a massive difference in the world</li><li>Independent thinkers, people who want to learn quickly and work hard.</li><li>Individuals with technical or entrepreneurial backgrounds.</li><li>Domain experts with deep knowledge in the particular field.</li><li>People who are value-aligned (have taken donation pledges before or plan to commit to our pledge).</li></ul><h2><strong>What kind of companies would we be particularly excited about?</strong></h2><p>Companies that can compete &amp; scale in traditional entrepreneurship pathways (such as getting into YC) an combine this with positive flow-through effects, e.g., in the areas of:</p><ul><li>Health Tech</li><li>HR tech, and specifically technological solutions that aim at increasing the flow of people and money between countries (see also our report on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://9475dbf4-555e-4808-9886-5f8ee815cc82.usrfiles.com/ugd/9475db_7c1919b5f90742b99ef54564cd751885.pdf\"><u>platforms facilitating Labor Migration</u></a> for inspiration)</li><li>Fintech and Supply Chain tech in LMIC countries, see also some suggestions by Ben Kuhn&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/M44rw22o5dbrRaA8F/why-and-how-to-start-a-for-profit-company-serving-emerging\"><u>here.</u></a></li><li>Food tech or Agri Tech companies&nbsp;</li><li>Biotech companies</li></ul><h1><strong>Why we think for-profit entrepreneurship is a promising path</strong></h1><h3><strong>a) We believe this career path can raise a particularly high amount of donations</strong></h3><p>Our model shows that this career path can be very impactful, with an average of $1M in GiveWell equivalent donations per founder per year&nbsp; (or similar standard in other cause areas). Exit values of companies are highly power lawed, which means that entrepreneurship is a somewhat \u201chits-based\u201d strategy. However, the median exit is still sizable and the upward potential is very large (95th percentile of $3.7M per year), making this career path competitive with other high-impact options.</p><h3><strong>b) Effective charities still have significant funding gaps</strong></h3><p>Over the last couple of years, many new, highly impactful charities have gotten started to solve the world's most pressing problems. However, as we have previously&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/GFkzLx7uKSK8zaBE3/we-need-more-nuance-regarding-funding-gaps\"><u>written</u></a> about, there are still&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cjH2puDzAFrtrrThQ/despite-billions-of-extra-funding-small-donors-can-still\"><u>significant gaps in funding</u></a> for these charities, which pose a significant risk to their survival and impact over the long term. Even many established highly impactful charities (in particular global health charities) have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2022/07/05/update-on-givewells-funding-projections/\"><u>significant room to absorb more funding effectively</u></a> (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/amf\"><u>AMF room for more funding</u></a> as an example). We believe money raised through this program could be hugely impactful.</p><h3><strong>c) Diversifying funding sources increases the long-term robustness of effective charities</strong></h3><p>More than simply increasing the total amount of funding available, we believe that through programs like these, we can help diversify the funding sources for highly effective charities. At the moment, funding for effectiveness-minded charities is concentrated in the hands of a few large donors. However, diversified donor bases are good for the health of individual organizations to avoid being overly dependent on any one donor. Effective projects can still be missed by effectiveness-focused funders. This leaves room for other donors to fill in the funding gap. We hope this program, alongside some of our other programs (such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/effective-giving-incubation\"><u>Effective Giving Incubation</u></a>) and other actors such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.founderspledge.com/\"><u>Founders Pledge</u></a>, can contribute to this funder diversity.</p><h3><strong>d) We believe that this career path has a much higher (potential) absorbency than founding a charity</strong></h3><p>Related to the above - because of limitations in philanthropic funding in certain cause areas, only so many effective charities can be started annually in this space. In for-profit routes, however, lack of funding is much less of a constraint. We hope that if we can build our knowledge base on impactful entrepreneurship, we can create paths to impact for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rjiGwvzBEbYj2Cth8/high-absorbency-career-paths\"><u>many more people</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>e) We believe it\u2019s valuable to create rigorous learnings around positive flow-through effects</strong></h3><p>We have very little available rigorous quantitative assessment of the positive flow-through effects of for-profit companies. AIM takes rigorous evaluation of impact seriously and is looking to work with field-leading experts in the field of M&amp;E to build better measurements for for-profit impacts. We feel this process and data could also be cross-applied to understand for-profit as a vehicle for impact. We\u2019re hoping that the companies that are founded through this program will serve as case studies that we can assess going forward.</p><p>You can learn more about our reasoning, theory of change, and the case for Founding to Give in our report below:<br>&nbsp;<img style=\"width:31.61%\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/q2PwXNsXsfDYkxeHb/f0prikmwyrlfvtimnf2x\"></p><p><a href=\"https://9475dbf4-555e-4808-9886-5f8ee815cc82.usrfiles.com/ugd/9475db_801e84aff34f4a2ab393eb9f1f56af04.pdf\"><u>[CLICK TO READ THE REPORT]</u></a></p><p>Founding to Give is an excellent opportunity for a highly impactful and rewarding career, that will significantly build your career capital and has the potential to help millions of humans or animals have better lives.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;We highly encourage everyone interested to <strong>apply by April 14, 2024</strong>:&nbsp;</p><a class=\"ck-cta-button ck-cta-button-centered\" data-href=\"https://form.jotform.com/240282852958365\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Apply now</a>", "user": {"username": "CE"}}, {"_id": "ujRZBW8LEt552zgWs", "title": "Hire the CEA Online team for software development & consulting", "postedAt": "2024-03-14T14:06:07.372Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>TL;DR: We are offering (paid) software consulting and contracting services to impactful projects.

As we\u2019re in the early stages of exploring this we are quite open in the sorts of projects we would consider, but just to give you some concrete ideas:</p><ul><li>Building a website that is more than a simple landing page. Think of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/\">AMF website</a>, which in spite of its deceptive appearance actually makes a lot of data available in a very transparent way. Or the Rethink Priorities <a href=\"https://ccm.rethinkpriorities.org/\">Cross-Cause Cost-Effectiveness Model</a>.</li><li>Building an internal tool to streamline some common process in your organisation.</li><li>Building a web platform that requires handling user data. E.g. a site that matches volunteers with relevant tasks. Or, if you can imagine it, some kind of web forum.</li></ul><p>If you have a project where you\u2019re not sure if we\u2019d be a good fit, please do reach out to us anyway. You will be providing a service to us just by telling us about it, as we want to understand what the needs in the community are. We might also be able to point you in the right direction or set you up with another contractor even if we aren\u2019t suitable ourselves.</p><p>In the projects we have completed so far, the thing that has been suggestive of this work being very worthwhile is that in most cases the project would have progressed much more slowly without us, or potentially not happened at all. This was either due to the people involved already having too many demands on their time, or having run into problems with their existing development process. We\u2019re excited to do more in the hope that having this available as a reliable service will push people to do software-dependent projects that they wouldn\u2019t have done otherwise, or execute them to a higher quality (and faster).</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"What_we_could_do_for_you\"><strong>What we could do for you</strong></h1><p>We're open to anything from \u201chigh-level consulting\u201d to \u201ctaking on a project entirely\u201d. In the \u201chigh-level consulting\u201d case we would do some initial setup and give you advice on how to proceed, so you could then take over the project or continue with other contractors (who we might be able to set you up with). In the \u201ctaking on a project entirely\u201d case we would be the contractors and would write all the code. The projects we have done so far have been more on the taking-on-entirely end of the spectrum.</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref2\">We also have an excellent designer, Agnes (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/agnestenlund?mention=user\">@agnestenlund</a>), and the capacity<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"3\" data-footnote-id=\"8cefa3pg9yr\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8cefa3pg9yr\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8cefa3pg9yr\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;to do product development work, such as conducting user interviews to gather requirements and then designing a solution based on those. This might be especially valuable if you have a lot of demands on your time and want to be able to hand off a project to a safe pair of hands.</p><p>As mentioned above, we&nbsp;are hoping to help with projects that are high-impact, so we\u2019ll decide what to work on based on our fit for the project, as well the financial and impact cases. As such, these are some characteristics that make a project more likely to be a good fit (non-exhaustive):</p><ul><li>Being motivated by EA principles and/or heavily embedded in the EA ecosystem.</li><li>Cases where your organisation is at low capacity, such that you have projects that you think would be valuable to do but don\u2019t have the time to commit to yourselves.</li><li data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref3\">Cases where we can help you navigate a technical area that you are unfamiliar with, such that you would struggle to execute the project on your own<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"4\" data-footnote-id=\"o9fp2mb7h2\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefo9fp2mb7h2\"><sup><a href=\"#fno9fp2mb7h2\">[4]</a></sup></span>.</li><li>Being medium-sized (more than a landing page, less than a Swapcard replacement).</li><li>Directly using something we have already built (such as the <a href=\"https://github.com/ForumMagnum/ForumMagnum\">Forum codebase</a>). This is also where the \u201chigh-level consulting\u201d end may be more useful as we can provide a lot of context in not that much time.</li></ul><p>And some sorts of projects that would probably not be a good fit:</p><ul><li>Projects that are very large, or which will require a lot of ongoing support. E.g. would require a full time engineer for a year.</li><li>Anything very specialised, such as pure-ML projects. Web development is our main area of expertise, and most things that fall under \u201cgeneral software development\u201d we should be more than capable of helping with.</li><li>Projects where software development should be part of your <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kz3Czn5ndFxaEofSx/why-cea-online-doesn-t-outsource-more-work-to-non-ea\">core competencies</a>.

However, I have encountered these arguments outside EA as well, among <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-30897-0_5\">activists</a>, political strategists, and \u201cregular folks\u201d (colleagues, friends, family). My journal contains many scattered notes, attesting to my discomfort and frustration with the - in my view, misguided - belief that a few individuals can (and should) have massive amounts of influence and impact by acting strategically. This text is an attempt to pull these notes together, giving a clear structure to the opposition I feel and turning it into a coherent argument that can be shared with and critiqued by others.</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"Impact_follows_a_power_law_distribution__The_argument_as_I_understand_it\">Impact follows a power law distribution: The argument as I understand it</h1><blockquote><p>\u201c<i>[T]he cost-effectiveness distributions of the most effective interventions and policies in education, health and climate change, are close to power-laws [...] the top intervention is 2 or almost 3 orders of magnitude (i.e. a factor 100 and almost 1000) more cost-effective than the least effective intervention.</i>\u201d - <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/FXaCnPMiw3jWrnkho/cost-effectiveness-distributions-power-laws-and-scale\">Stijn, 2021</a></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\u201c<i>If you\u2019re trying to tackle a problem, it\u2019s vital to look for the very best solutions in an area, rather than those that are just \u2018good.\u2019 This contrasts with the common attitude that what matters is trying to \u2018make a difference,\u2019 or that \u2018every little bit helps.\u2019 If some solutions achieve 100 times more per year of effort, then it really matters that we try to find those that make the most difference to the problem.</i>\u201d - <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/solutions/#how-much-do-solutions-differ-in-how-well-they-work\">Todd, 2021(2023)</a></p></blockquote><p>My understanding of the narrative that I disagree with and seek to tackle in this essay is as follows. First, the basic case for the impact maximisation imperative/goal (which I am broadly sympathetic to, though with some reservations on points e-g):</p><ul><li>a) There are many problems in the world - poverty and ill-health, mistreatment of non-humans, war and violence, natural catastrophes, and risks related to the climate crisis, pandemics, weapons of mass destruction, and rapid technological advancements, to name just a few.</li></ul><ul><li data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref1\">b) It would be better (by the standards of a wide range of different ethical beliefs and worldviews<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"2\" data-footnote-id=\"6tr54qcsgod\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6tr54qcsgod\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6tr54qcsgod\">[2]</a></sup></span>) if there were fewer problems, or less severe problems.</li><li>c) There are things people like us could do to reduce the severity of many of these problems,</li><li>d) but we cannot solve all of them immediately.</li><li>e) If possible, it is better to focus our energies on the actions that will lead to the greatest reduction in problem severity across the range of problems we care about.</li><li>f) We have the tools and information to roughly estimate the severity of different problems, the success of past actions in addressing these problems, and the success chances of future actions.</li><li>g) Conclusion: We should use tools and information at our disposal to figure out which actions, or sets of actions / strategies, are most promising when it comes to reducing a large share of the problems our world faces, and we should then take those actions.</li></ul><p>In addition to this, people in effective altruism, or in the impact maximisation space more broadly, have latched on to the idea that there are huge potential differences in the value (success in reducing global problem severity) of different approaches to doing good. This is often described as a \u201cpower law distribution of impact\u201d, illustrated with something like Figure 1, and driven home by numerical claims such as \u201cthe top intervention is 2 or almost 3 orders of magnitude (i.e. a factor 100 and almost 1000) more cost-effective than the least effective intervention\u201d (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/FXaCnPMiw3jWrnkho/cost-effectiveness-distributions-power-laws-and-scale\">Stijn, 2021</a>).</p><p><img style=\"width:624.00px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bbMMTFa3HN2SPApLC/qdzyl2qt7zhthvohbdiy\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Figure 1: Screenshot taken from Todd, 2021 (2023), \u201c<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/solutions/#how-much-do-solutions-differ-in-how-well-they-work\">The Best Solutions Are Far More Effective Than Others</a>\u201d, <i>80,000 Hours</i>.</p><p>As far as I can tell, the \u201cpower law claim\u201d first emerged explicitly in the field of global health and development, based on a study by Ord (<a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/publication/moral-imperative-toward-cost-effectiveness-global-health\">2013</a>). It has been reexamined and somewhat moderated (<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2023/02/how-much-do-solutions-differ-in-effectiveness/\">Todd 2023</a>), but the core message - some interventions are magnitudes more promising than others - was retained and even extended to other domains: from education, social programmes, and CO2 emissions reductions policies to efforts to change habits of meat consumption and voter turnout (<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/solutions/#how-much-do-solutions-differ-in-how-well-they-work\">Todd 2021(2023)</a>). From anecdotal/observational evidence, the idea also seems common when people talk about approaches for reducing existential and global catastrophic risks, whether they are focusing on artificial intelligence, bioengineering and bioterrorism, nuclear weapons, or other related risks.&nbsp;Likewise, I have encountered the notion of widely differing impact potential in discussions around political/policy work more generally.</p><h1 data-internal-id=\"This_seems_off_\">This seems off\u2026</h1><p>There are numerous value-laden and controversial assumptions in the basic case for impact maximisation that I laid out above, but I will not tackle these directly here (suffice it to say that I broadly agree with claims a-d, and have reservations about e-g, though I do think they have some validity). Instead, I focus on the specific claim that there are huge (orders of magnitude) differences in the value of different attempts to do good.</p><p>I agree that there is a massive difference between actions/strategies that are net-negative, neutral, and net-positive; in other words, I do agree that it is really important to figure out whether an action or strategy actually contributes to solving a problem at all, and whether it may cause unintended negative effects. However, <strong>I do not agree that there are vast differences in value among those actions and strategies that have crossed the bar of having a significant positive impact on the world</strong>; and <strong>I do not agree that some individuals are orders of magnitude more important for making the world better than everyone else</strong>.</p><p>In addition, <strong>I believe that an excessive focus on \u201csecuring high impact opportunities\u201d is unhelpful to our collective effort of making the world a better place</strong>. I am slightly confused about whether that latter criticism is better framed as an empirical disagreement (about the consequences of employing the \u201cpower law distribution of impact\u201d narrative), a normative concern (about the values and ideas that are conveyed by that narrative), or a conceptual issue (about the appropriateness and usefulness of the perspective as a model to understand the world). I have tried to tease out the specific points I take issue with, and I\u2019m curious to hear in comments and feedback whether the write-up that follows seems coherent or whether you think I\u2019m turning in circles and should have chosen a different categorisation.</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"Empirical_problem__Impact_results_from_numerous_inputs_and_thus_cannot_be_attributed_straightforwardly_to_any_one_action\">Empirical problem: Impact results from numerous inputs and thus cannot be attributed straightforwardly to any one action</h2><blockquote><p>\u201c<i>No one changes the world alone, and no one doesn't change it at all.</i>\u201d - <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OCO8eoDWqHQ\">Hank Green (2017)</a></p></blockquote><p>For most conceivable outcomes, it seems misleading to suggest that they are the result of one action, one individual, or one organisation. Impact does not seem to be a property that can sensibly be assigned to an individual. If an individual (or organisation) takes an action, there a number of reasons why I think that the subsequent consequences/impact can't solely be attributed to that one individual:</p><ol><li>The action's consequences will depend a lot on how other people act, and on other features of the environment. Impact is thus the result of collective (often long-time) efforts, diffused in an unspecifiable manner across numerous individuals.<br><br>For instance, the discovery of the polio vaccine by itself doesn't do much good. The impact it has depends on how the vaccine is distributed and administered, which depends on numerous state and private actors. It also depends on popular attitudes towards the vaccine (willingness/eagerness to make use of it), which depend on probably even more actors and environmental factors. I have great respect and gratitude for the people who produced the polio vaccine for the first time; but I don't think it makes sense to take the number of lives saved/improved and stuff all of that into their individual impact scorecard. If we must attribute quantified individual credit to the inventors of the vaccine (and I will argue <a href=\"#Conceptual_problem__If_we_want_to_actually_see_the_emergence_of_a_better_world__individualised_impact_calculations_are_not_the_best_path_to_action\">below</a>&nbsp;that probably we shouldn\u2019t try to in the first place), it will have to be much smaller than the total good that resulted from the vaccine, as that total volume of impact would need to be distributed across all those actors influencing the trajectory of the vaccine\u2019s administration (and across the people who influenced the developers themselves and their enabling environment, see points 2) and 3) below).</li><li>Whether or not an action can be taken in the first place depends on the environment and on the actions of other people.<br><br>For instance, most people will probably put the US president into the category \u201chigh-impact individual.\u201d And there are certainly many impactful things the president can do that are not accessible to most other people. But for achieving most goals that can be said to really matter - a better healthcare system that actually improves wellbeing in the country; effective technology policy that actually reduces risks and/or advances life-improving technological developments; a sufficient response to the climate crisis; etc. - presidents themselves will tell you how incredibly constrained they are in bringing about these outcomes. The impact a president can have through sensible policies is determined by the actions of many other individuals (domestically and internationally), and it is also determined by the culture he or she operates in (the ideas that are considered normal, palatable, or even just conceivable). Yes, this individual can have an impact through their actions, but only in conjunction with the actions of many others. If we tried to account for all individuals that form part of the president\u2019s enabling infrastructure (again, I will argue below that we probably can\u2019t and should not try), I am sceptical whether the individualised impact that remains with the president\u2019s actions truly is orders of magnitude higher than that of many other people.</li><li>An individual\u2019s decision to take an action is influenced by numerous factors, all of which partake in the impact that results from the decision.<br><br>The individual taking an action is not a blank slate. She herself is influenced by numerous factors, including other people. Arguably, the impact from an individual's action can also be attributed to those people who influenced the individual into taking the action in the first place. The number of influencing factors is usually huge - from parents and others contributing to the individual's education/socialisation to friends and colleagues to people who are strategically trying to influence the individual all the way to culture, artists and storytellers who shape the ideas and intuitions that determine what seems sensible and normatively desirable to the individual.</li></ol><p>All of this leads me to doubt whether impact can be empirically attributed to individuals at all, which I will try to flesh out in more detail <a href=\"#Conceptual_problem__If_we_want_to_actually_see_the_emergence_of_a_better_world__individualised_impact_calculations_are_not_the_best_path_to_action\">below</a>. Importantly for this section, it also leads to me suspect that, if an individualised impact attribution were brute-forced in spite of the empirical and conceptual difficulties, the eventual impact left with any one individual would not be a massive outlier (orders of magnitude apart from everybody else), because impact would be dispersed across a) all the actors that contribute to the outcomes before and after any individual action is taken, and across b) all the actors that shape the taking of any individual action in the first place.</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"Adverse_effects__Does_this_idea_perspective_encourage_elitism__anti_democratic_sentiment__and_a_differential_valuation_of_human_lives_\">Adverse effects: Does this idea/perspective encourage elitism, anti-democratic sentiment, and a differential valuation of human lives?</h2><p>One of the concerns I have with the narrative that impact follows a power law distribution is that I\u2019ve seen this idea used as a (strong) argument to discourage individuals from taking actions that I think should be considered highly valuable. More specifically, I have the impression that talk about \u201chigh impact opportunities\u201d often (though not necessarily) goes hand-in-hand with a rather naive consequentialist attitude that pays attention mainly to direct, and often easily measurable, effects (discussed, among others, in <a href=\"https://thefragilereal.substack.com/p/the-evolution-of-impact\">Mandefro 2023</a>). For instance, jobs that I would consider vital for a resilient society and an effective collective effort to make the world better -&nbsp;thoughtful teachers and social workers, caring doctors and nurses, responsive and diligent civil servants -, are often discounted by those people who claim that individuals can and should aim to achieve magnitudes more in terms of positive impact than the average person (e.g., <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/medical-careers/\">Lewis 2015</a>). Likewise, a focus on maximising the impact of individual actions can easily lead to the discounting of acts that are meaningful only if performed persistently by a large group of people - casting a vote, participating in protests, signing petitions, engaging in dinner&nbsp;table conversations, and so on. If I am right that impact does not actually follow a power law distribution and that the jobs &amp; acts just mentioned are actually much closer in importance to the \u201chighest possible life paths\u201d than suggested, this type of discouragement based on misleading claims seems at least mildly counterproductive for the goal of making the world better.</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref3\">Relatedly, I am concerned that the belief in high impact differentials, and a concomitant neglect for the (indirect, longrunning) impact of small actions, can lead individuals to disregard common-sense virtues and rules of behaviour if they stand in the way of a perceived \u201chigh impact opportunity.\u201d While I certainly wouldn\u2019t argue that common-sense morality is a sure guide to always doing \u201cthe right thing,\u201d I do think that adopting a general disposition to (try to) act virtuously and to consistently - though not blindly - abide by certain behavioural heuristics (e.g., respect all people around you; don\u2019t be disingenuous; be truth-seeking; etc. etc.) is warranted. If the pursuit of maximum impact leads to a <i>complete</i><span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"3\" data-footnote-id=\"9oxuo93t0mi\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9oxuo93t0mi\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9oxuo93t0mi\">[3]</a></sup></span><i>&nbsp;</i>sidelining of considerations around how to be a reliable, trustworthy, and constructive member of your communities, I think you\u2019re paying a cost that\u2019s higher than you should be willing to accept.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"4\" data-footnote-id=\"p608gz45o48\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefp608gz45o48\"><sup><a href=\"#fnp608gz45o48\">[4]</a></sup></span></p><blockquote><p>\"<i>There is nothing more corrupting, nothing more destructive of the noblest and finest feelings of our nature, than the exercise of unlimited power</i>.\"</p><p>- <a href=\"https://www.thoughtco.com/famous-presidential-quotes-2833521\">William Henry Harrison (former US President)</a></p></blockquote><p>Putting debates around the actual distribution of impact to the side, I am worried about normative side-effects that seem concerning even if the underlying narrative is an apt description of the world. I fully acknowledge that the side-effects described in the next few paragraphs are not strictly implied by the claim that there can be magnitudes of difference in the impact two individuals have. But I find myself with an intuition and a plausible-sounding narrative that links claims around \u201cpower law distributions of impact\u201d to the normative concerns I\u2019m about to discuss. If there is anything to that intuition and such a link does exist in practice (even if only weakly), then I would argue that this gives good reason to pause and reconsider the use and propagation of the \u201cpower law\u201d narrative.</p><p>I am concerned that the idea of huge impact differentials between actions reinforces the belief that a few vanguard individuals can fix the world - or fix some of the major problems we see in the world. I am concerned that this vanguardism weakens demands for measures that would strengthen communities, improve democratic culture and practice, and enhance our collective action capabilities, because strong communities, democratic participation, and effective collective action seem less vital if we can hope for a small group of elites to contribute the vast majority of inputs towards \u201cmaking the world better.\u201d</p><p>I am also concerned that a belief in a small-ish group of individual saviours could lead to hubris <a href=\"https://effectiviology.com/hubris/\">(Effectiviology n.d.)</a>&nbsp;and an unwarranted sense of confidence and control (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02311.x\">Fast et al. 2009</a>), lust for power (<a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/openview/edf931a5705fe92cfd9c11bbef2647bf/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=38870\">Weidner &amp; Purohit 2009</a>; more polemically: <a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/360521332_'Power_Addiction'_and_its_Perils\">Walton 2022</a>), or burnout among the supposed highest-impact individuals and to perceived disempowerment, helpless indifference, or angry resistance among those who seem to be left out from that select group (<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-031-24235-9\">Harrison 2023</a>). All of this seems quite corrosive to societal decision-making processes, both at an individual level (people\u2019s cognitive abilities to make sound decisions are hampered by the emotions listed before) and at the collective level (people are less willing and able to work together constructively if they are arrogant, worn-out, hopeless, mindlessly angry, and/or deeply distrusting of their fellow citizens). It also just seems quite undesirable to live in a world full of self-absorbed elites on the one hand, and disillusioned common people on the other.</p><blockquote><p>\u201c<i>You\u2019re probably among the 0.1% most highly productive individuals [...] You\u2019re probably worth the same as three average EAs</i>\u201d</p><p>- Anonymous effective altruist (conversation I overheard at an EA community event)</p></blockquote><p>Lastly, I am concerned about implicit, or sometimes quite explicit, judgments about the value of individuals when comparing them based on impact metrics (illustrated, for instance, by <a href=\"https://www.proquest.com/openview/ee4fcb4887429d186e9d51b8cd0cd8da/1?cbl=18750&amp;pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;parentSessionId=G%2FwqlZK1vAyHdlSBkkoq7MW8W4Pv4Rw1PdH8OtFq1X8%3D\">Lipshitz 2018</a>, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nY60zaTtQ6Qb6pz3CRGld6Fhvnbdi7PK/view?usp=sharing\">full book pdf</a>). I think that there is a danger of switching from \u201csome actions are more important than others\u201d to \u201csome <i>people</i>&nbsp;- the ones best-able to perform high-impact actions - are more important and thus more valuable than others.\u201d I think that this is a problem because it undermines very basic community principles around solidarity and mutual respect, which I believe are vital for individual flourishing as well as sustainable collective problem-solving capabilities. This seems to be a thorny problem whenever impact is measured and attributed to individuals, but I imagine it will be worse the larger we believe potential differences in impact to be.</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"Conceptual_problem__If_we_want_to_actually_see_the_emergence_of_a_better_world__individualised_impact_calculations_are_not_the_best_path_to_action\">Conceptual problem: If we want to actually see the emergence of a better world, individualised impact calculations are not the best path to action</h2><blockquote><p>\u201c<i>Do your little bit of good where you are; it is those little bits of good put together that overwhelm the world</i>.\u201d - <a href=\"https://www.thenationalnews.com/arts-culture/books/2021/12/26/a-look-back-at-desmond-tutus-greatest-quotes-from-kindness-to-forgiveness/\">Archbishop Desmond Tutu</a></p></blockquote><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref4\">While examining the empirical validity of claims around the supposed \u201cpower law distribution of social impact,\u201d I was growing increasingly sceptical about the goal of attributing impact scores to individual actions and individual people in the first place. As I was trying to argue that the results of any given action need to be distributed across a wide collection of contributing and enabling actions, I kept wanting to write (or shout at my screen): \u201cBut isn\u2019t this a futile and misleading exercise? Impact simply isn\u2019t concentrated in one individual. How can we even speak about the impact of one individual person in isolation, when their actions and their actions\u2019 effects can only ever be observed in an interactive environment? Isn\u2019t it fundamentally wrong-headed to think about achieving positive change in the world from an isolated, individualised standpoint?\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"5\" data-footnote-id=\"bzd4o5k3lqj\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbzd4o5k3lqj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbzd4o5k3lqj\">[5]</a></sup></span></p><p>The seemingly plausible (?) possibility of adverse effects - that an emphasis on high impact differentials may discourage bottom-up and collective action; that it may neglect and thus weaken the social fabric which we need as a backbone to and prime enabler of a thriving world - reinforces my sense that an emphasis on individual impact is not the best ingredient for an effective and sustainable movement strategy to make the world better.</p><p>As an alternative, I believe we - people trying to address pressing global problems - would do better to conceive of impact as the product of a large set of actions and people, not a quantity that can be apportioned sensibly to any one individual. We would probably benefit from a good deal of humility about the influence of any one action and from a steadfast (and simplicity-resistant) awareness of the complex environment we operate in. While analyses about the marginal benefits of two specific competing actions, roughly holding all other factors equal, may well retain their uses in some situations (see <a href=\"#I_don_t_mean_to_throw_the_baby_out_with_the_bathwater__Looking_for_actions_with_an_exceptionally_high_impact_is_not_always_entirely_misguided\">below</a>), we might reconsider whether less atomised perspectives are better suited to guiding decision-making in other situations.</p><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref5\">For instance, when finding myself in the possession of consequential information about a topic of public interest, maybe I should ask myself \u201cWhat would I want the majority of other people to do in such a situation?

Or would I want them to share the information publicly?\u201d Or maybe, in deciding how to treat people around me, I should wonder which actions and attitudes make for a constructive collaborator, a reliable friend, or a respecting colleague, rather than calculating how best I can use my connections and \u201crelationships\u201d to catapult myself into the (possibly imaginary) category of super-high-impact-individuals - not (just) because there may be an intrinsic moral value in virtuous behaviour but also and especially because such virtuous behaviour may be one of the essential building blocks to achieving our optimal collective impact potential. And maybe, when choosing a job or making a career move, it is enough to ask \u201cWhich kinds of contribution do we as a community really need, which of those do we currently lack, and which am I well-placed to deliver?\u201d rather than seeking to answer \u201cWhich position do I need to reach in order to be in the 99th percentile of an imaginary and narrowly-conceptualised global impact distribution?\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"6\" data-footnote-id=\"830x04urt62\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref830x04urt62\"><sup><a href=\"#fn830x04urt62\">[6]</a></sup></span></p><h1 data-internal-id=\"Caveats_and_disclaimers\">Caveats and disclaimers</h1><p>I wrote this essay primarily as a reflection on my own thoughts.

In my example of what to do when acquiring secretive information that could either be used for private influence or released to the public, my question is clearly reminiscent of Kant\u2019s Categorical Imperative (see <a href=\"https://www.britannica.com/topic/categorical-imperative\">Britannica n.d.</a>)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"7\" data-footnote-id=\"giopplj0i9h\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgiopplj0i9h\"><sup><a href=\"#fngiopplj0i9h\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and of rule-consequentialist arguments (e.g., <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0953820813000289\">Burch-Brown 2014</a>). In my discussions around virtuous behaviour, I present a drastically shortened reproduction of the theory of \u201cvirtue consequentialism\u201d (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1017/S0953820805001652\">Bradley 2005</a>), which has been endorsed in spirit though not in name by several \u201cnon-naive\u201d consequentialists in the effective altruism space (e.g., <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/naive-vs-prudent-utilitarianism\">Chappell 2022</a>; <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/q7WwTuZQWMqDEEoWM/virtues-for-real-world-utilitarians\">Schubert and Caviola 2021</a>; <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MKaaGJiehjc4Rm6Gq/justin-oakley-virtue-ethics-and-effective-altruism\">Oakley 2015, talk at an EA Global conference</a>) as well as by proponents of common sense morality and advocates for notions of basic human dignity across the social impact ecosystem (<a href=\"https://op.europa.eu/en/publication-detail/-/publication/39416607-6bc5-11ed-9887-01aa75ed71a1\">European Commission 2022</a>; <a href=\"https://jenn.site/2023/05/things-i-learned-by-spending-five-thousand-hours-in-non-ea-charities/\">Jenn 2023</a>). And in calling on people to pursue the more humble quest of finding one\u2019s place in a collective project rather than striving to become an individual of outstanding impact, I employ notions familiar from satisficing theory (<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/4106846\">Slote and Pettit 1984</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/02684527.2021.1901404\">Ben-Haim 2021</a>) and the literature on collective rationality (<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/1962065\">Finkel et al. 1989</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WAEsPBvS4s50zQQ0nyLTLv0LoRRuQhJw/view?usp=sharing\">pdf</a>); <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1177/0048393105284167\">Gilbert 2006</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t_mBzvk_fXGeymf9fg0CacbGGMsJ6RzG/view?usp=sharing\">pdf</a>); <a href=\"https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315246512-19/collective-action-rational-choice-place-community-limits-individual-self-interest-miller-byron\">Byron 2008</a>).</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"I_don_t_mean_to_throw_the_baby_out_with_the_bathwater__Looking_for_actions_with_an_exceptionally_high_impact_is_not_always_entirely_misguided\">I don\u2019t mean to throw the baby out with the bathwater: Looking for actions with an exceptionally high impact is not always entirely misguided</h2><p data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref7\">While this post clearly advocates for a reconsideration of the dominance of individualised impact evaluations within debates around how to make the world better, I do not want to denigrate considerations about individual contexts altogether. I think that it is probably often good and non-harmful to evaluate different actions with an eye to the impact each one is likely to have. I also think it can be sensible to rank some life and career paths in accordance with how much impact they may roughly afford (differentiating, for instance, between a net-negative role of a snakeoil salesperson, the probably neutral role of someone working a \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs\">bullshit job</a>\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"8\" data-footnote-id=\"6o7t9gqb5o7\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6o7t9gqb5o7\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6o7t9gqb5o7\">[8]</a></sup></span>; and the range of societally beneficially roles that lie beyond). But the crucial point I am trying to make in this essay is that this should not be the only lens to apply, that we should not forget about indirect effects and cumulative dynamics which individualised evaluation seem poorly-equipped to capture, and that we should not feel overly confident in how granular our impact attributions can be even if we put our best minds and methods to the task.</p><h2 data-internal-id=\"Remaining_uncertainties_and_confusion\">Remaining uncertainties and confusion</h2><p>As mentioned before, I have spent quite some time thinking, reading and talking about the arguments in this essay.

Even so, I remain uncertain about my final stance and its practical implications:</p><ul><li>What is the crux between me and the people who buy into the narrative of power law distributions in impact?</li><li>To the extent that disagreements with my arguments persist after people have read and sincerely engaged with what I said here: How much should that shift my own confidence in my views, if at all?</li><li data-internal-id=\"ftnt_ref8\">I seem to<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"9\" data-footnote-id=\"i71fhiixemn\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefi71fhiixemn\"><sup><a href=\"#fni71fhiixemn\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;disagree fundamentally with one of effective altruism\u2019s core propositions.

If my thoughts on this were prompted by a cultural bias / unsubstantiated intuition, but I now cannot find major flaws in the reasoning I developed upon reflection, should I still be sceptical about my current views and conclusions?<ul><li>Is every argument emerging from motivated/prejudiced reasoning poor or dubious? Or can an argument be sound, even if it was developed with the conclusion already in mind?</li><li>How different is this process from \u201cthe normal\u201d belief formation process? How often do we form beliefs around important questions without having an intuition for the conclusion in mind a priori?</li></ul></li></ul><h1 data-internal-id=\"Acknowledgements\">Acknowledgements</h1><p>In the spirit of the essay, it would seem appropriate that I acknowledge and give credit to all the people who influenced my thinking and writing on this topic.

These people may be&nbsp;<i>replaceable</i> from a counterfactual point of view, but they are not&nbsp;<i>irrelevant</i> - if we lived in a world without communities of people performing these supportive roles, we would be screwed.

Here, we build on salius\u2019 work through additional research, including conversations with members of the feeder rodent industry. We provide a new estimate of the size and scope of the industry, an overview of how feeder rodents are farmed, the market structure of the global feeder rodent trade, the major customers and farming operations, and welfare considerations based on our interviews and a site visit to a small rodent farm. Finally, we discuss two concrete ways to help the hundreds of millions of rodents farmed each year: public pressure campaigns against zoos, and creating sausages that could serve as an alternative to whole animal feeding.</p><h1>Industry Overview</h1><h2><strong>Feeder Rodent Population</strong></h2><p>We&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/23291\"><u>estimate</u></a> that there are 200-650 million feeder rodents produced globally each year. Of these rodents, we estimate 150-500 million are mice and 28-120 million are rats. There is also a small amount of guinea pigs farmed each year, fed to the largest of snakes, birds of prey, and felines, but we expect this number is very low relative to the total number of rodents. This estimate is congruent with salius\u2019 previous estimates of 85 million to 2.1 billion. The estimate also aligns with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/the-great-rat-race-1099948.html\"><u>report in the Independent</u></a> which pegged the number at 167 million feeder rodents sold in the US in 1999, which was well before the large Chinese farms entered the market, though it is unclear how the author reached his conclusion.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Rodent Farming</strong></h2><p>Rodents are farmed in tubs that are placed in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.arscaging.com/ars_caging.php?dept=100\"><u>rodent racks</u></a>. Depending on the size of the operation, each tub will include male and female breeders in a ratio of roughly 4 to 6 females to each male, and some number of litters of baby rodents. In larger operations, it is not uncommon for one tub to have 10 male, 60 female breeders, and many baby rodents. Each tub is typically lined with liquid absorbent bedding, usually wood shavings or paper strips. Rodent food is generally supplied in the form of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mazuri.com/products/mazuri-rodent-breeder-6f\"><u>formulated pellets</u></a> that sit on wiring on top of the tub opening, and water is provided either via gravity-fed bottles or automated watering systems that run throughout the rack.&nbsp;</p><p>Each mouse will generally have 5-10 litters per year and around 3-20 children per litter. Rats can have up to 8 litters per year and average 8 children per litter. These ranges can vary widely based on environmental conditions and evolved changes to the breeding line. Some operations will selectively breed for higher litter size or other desired traits and will cull breeder females when they become unproductive. Children are \u201cpulled\u201d or \u201charvested\u201d from the tubs, often pre-wean, and killed. Weaned children are often placed in a separate tub where they grow to the desired size before being killed. Farming large numbers of rodents can thus be quite concentrated, with small buildings able to produce millions of rodents per year. For example, the photo below shows Mice Direct\u2019s mouse farm in Georgia, which you can also see a video of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MvNbfDwQUA\"><u>here.</u></a></p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BHCjijbDnHJCkGB9n/rzrui8sdfnuajkkqlrvs\"><figcaption>Mice Direct Mouse Farm in Georgia (~2-7 million mice per year)</figcaption></figure><p>Replacement breeders are taken directly from the colony. The rodent population is therefore self-propagating, meaning that genetics are not as heavily optimized as they are in other areas of animal agriculture. Colonies of rodents can collapse occasionally, typically as a result of disease. In these circumstances, which one industry professional told us can happen every 2-3 years, replacement breeders would be purchased live from another operation.</p><h2><strong>Slaughter</strong></h2><p>Slaughter methods depend on the age of the rodent and the size of the farming operation. Feeder mice and rats are exempt from the Animal Welfare Act and are thus,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://petadvocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Feeder-Rodent-Best-Management-Practices.pdf\"><u>according to an industry document</u></a>, not subject to any sort of welfare regulations. The American Zoo Association, which accredits most of the major zoos in the US, states that feeder animal vendors&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nagonline.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/humane_management_of_vertebrate_feeder_animals.pdf\"><i><u>should</u></i><u> adhere to AVMA standards</u></a> (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-02/Guidelines-on-Euthanasia-2020.pdf\"><u>here</u></a>, especially page 60-62). The large feeder rodent producers claim to kill via regulated flow CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation. After slaughter, rodents are generally put in zip-locked bags and frozen before being distributed.</p><p>Mice and rat neonates, referred to in the industry as \u201cpinkies\u201d can take 30 minutes to 1 hour to die from CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation, and so AVMA standards allow alternative methods like live freezing of mice and rats that are under 10 days of age. Flash freezing with liquid N<sub>2</sub> is also an AVMA acceptable euthanasia method for rats and mice under 5 days.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://petadvocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Feeder-Rodent-Best-Management-Practices.pdf\"><u>Standard practice</u></a> is to freeze live neonates, which comprise a significant portion of total feeder rodent sales.</p><p>There aren\u2019t good ways to enforce that these approved methods are being used. For example, in our visit to a small rodent breeder, they killed rodents by violently hitting them against the sides of their cage.</p><h2><strong>Live vs Frozen</strong></h2><p>Rodents can be fed to snakes either live or frozen. If frozen, rodents are first thawed and then put into the enclosure with the reptile. Frozen feeding is much more common, but in some countries like the US, live feeding is still practiced. Live feeding is a topic of considerable and heated debate within the snake owner community, and in some countries like in the UK, appears to be extremely rare. Indeed, most large centralized operations, which exclusively freeze their rodents, discourage live rodent feeding on their websites. Major zoos in the US also do not engage in live feeding&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nagonline.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/humane_management_of_vertebrate_feeder_animals.pdf\"><u>unless it is required</u></a> to stimulate the prey drive of the species. The major concerns around live feeding are the safety of the reptile (live rodents can sometimes fight back and injure snakes), and the welfare of the rodents.</p><h2><strong>Feeder Rodent Production: Local</strong></h2><p>Most feeder rodents are produced by one of a small handful of consolidated producers (see below). However, up to one-third of global production consists of smaller producers that distribute locally.&nbsp;</p><p>There are four options for acquiring locally produced rodents: farming your own, buying from a local small rodent farm (example&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqfUsLN7ckI\"><u>here</u></a>), buying on a reptile forum or social media platform, or buying a pet mouse or rat from a pet store (which is generally more expensive). As snake keeping is a hobby, there are many people who decide to start small-scale farming of feeder rodents to feed their own reptiles. Many of these hobbyists will end up producing more than they need and will start selling their excess to friends or on reptile forums, facebook, or instagram, and some of these hobbyists will evolve into small local rodent farms. We classify anything produced from these four channels as local production. Some of these locally produced rodents are sold live and some are sold frozen. Nearly all live rodent sales are from local channels since shipping live rodents is more burdensome and costly, especially over long distances.</p><p>We spoke with multiple feeder rodent industry professionals to try to understand the breakdown between local and centralized production. The owner of one top distributor of frozen rodents, said that there was no data on this topic, but he would estimate that it could be that up to a third of feeder mice in the US are purchased locally from hobbyist/ local/ and regional farms. Another industry professional said that the number could be less than that, but that there is simply no data. We did find one&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110311132443/http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/monitoring/documents/salmonella-typhimurium-090624.pdf\"><u>government report from the UK</u></a> that corroborated that local production was less than one-third of total feeder rodent purchases. The report states that 80% of the total feeder rodents consumed in the UK were supplied through a few main distributors in 2008.</p><p>There are also structural reasons why the number is likely fairly low: snake owners may not live close to a regional or local rodent farm, and given some of these local purchases are live, you can not buy in bulk unless you have your own cages, driving the cost per mouse higher. Forum and social media posts also suggest that many snake owners believe feeding live is dangerous for the snake. Based on our conversations with producers and the structural reasons that disincentivize live and local rodent sales, we estimate that the global upper bound for locally produced feeder rodents would be a third of total production, and it is probably lower.</p><h2><strong>Feeder Rodent Production: Centralized</strong></h2><p>Centralized farming operations thus account for over two-thirds of global feeder rodent production. All centralized farming operations produce frozen rodents, and many produce millions of rodents per year. One example of a commercial operation can be seen&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MvNbfDwQUA\"><u>here.</u></a> There are centralized farming operations in China, the US, and Europe. Some of these operations are vertically integrated where the company will breed the rodents, distribute to zoos and pet stores, and also manage a direct-to-consumer ecommerce channel. Many of the largest distributors in the US have large farming operations themselves or employ a contract growing model where the distributor owns the brand, but is buying from separately owned large farms. As there are no public rodent breeding companies, it is difficult to know exactly which companies own their own farms vs use a contract farming model. In the US, Canada, and the UK, it is clear that centralized distributors also supply a patchwork of downstream distributors that focus on supplying smaller customers.</p><h2><strong>Major Distributors and Farming Operations</strong></h2><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Major Distributors</strong></td><td><strong>Country</strong></td><td><strong>Estimated Rodents Farmed Annually</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Daren Fucheng</td><td>China</td><td>20-40 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Yukylin</td><td>China</td><td>20-40 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Honfer</td><td>China</td><td>5-25 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Rodent Pro</td><td>US</td><td>25-85 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Mice Direct</td><td>US</td><td>2-7 Million</td></tr><tr><td>American Rodent Supply</td><td>US</td><td>0</td></tr><tr><td>Perfect Prey</td><td>US</td><td>Unknown</td></tr><tr><td>Cold Blooded Cafe</td><td>US</td><td>Unknown</td></tr><tr><td>Big Cheese Rodent Factory</td><td>US</td><td>Unknown</td></tr><tr><td>Euro Mice</td><td>Lithuania</td><td>9-15 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Monkfield Reptile</td><td>Lithuania / UK</td><td>9-15 Million</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>RodentPro is likely the largest producer in the world by number of rodents. They employ a contract farming model and have a network of farms around Indiana from which they source for wholesale and export. RodentPro, and possibly some of the other US distributors, also buy excess rodents produced by the major lab rodent companies like Charles River, Jackson Labs, and Taconic. They also have a strong ecommerce business, accounting for 42% of the web traffic to major US rodent producers (the next largest being Big Cheese Rodent Factory with 17% and Perfect Prey with 11%).</p><h2><strong>Global Trade</strong></h2><p>The estimates of our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/23291\"><u>global feeder rodent production model</u></a> suggest that the US and China account for around three quarters of global production, producing 43% and 31% of global feeder rodents respectively, though our estimates imply a wide possible range. This is congruent with qualitative assessments from the industry, global import data, and extant information from the farms themselves. European centralized and local production makes up the bulk of the remaining quarter of global production.&nbsp;</p><p>China is a major exporter of rodents, and it is likely that the US exports some of its production as well.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://importkey.com/login/ended\"><u>Public and complete trade data is available</u></a> for imports into the US, and so we were able to compile information about frozen rodent shipments from China to the US, but because public shipment data is not available for many European countries and some Asian countries, it is less clear what other markets the three Chinese companies export to and to what markets the US companies export to. One Chinese producer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://darenpetfood.en.alibaba.com/\"><u>reports</u></a> exporting to Japan, Europe, and Hong Kong. There is also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/30/business/global/30mice.html\"><u>evidence</u></a> that US companies export to Europe, and a<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20110311132443/http://www.defra.gov.uk/foodfarm/farmanimal/diseases/monitoring/documents/salmonella-typhimurium-090624.pdf\"><u> UK government report&nbsp;</u></a>that implies that at a minimum three of the main US distributors are exporters to the UK.<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Chinese production has grown significantly in the last decade, with one company, Yukylin,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.yukylin.cn/ENews/Read/269.aspx\"><u>opening its farm in 2014</u></a> and is now likely producing 20-40 million rodents per year. Honfer, another of the three Chinese farms, just started exporting to the US in 2021 and is now likely producing 5 to 25 million rodents per year. The three major Chinese exporters are all based in Qingdao. Daren Fucheng has a strategic partnership with Qingdao Agricultural University. Unlike the main US producers, Daren Fucheng and Honfer also both also supply genetically engineered mice to Chinese research laboratories.&nbsp;</p><p>The export data, pulled in September of 2023, implies that Chinese exports to the US grew at a compound annual growth rate of 35% between 2017 and 2023. By estimating the percent of exports that are mice vs rats and estimating the mean weight exported of each species, it appears exports from China to the US are between 23 to 62 million rodents annually as of 2023.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td colspan=\"3\"><strong>Chinese Exports to the US</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Year</strong></td><td><strong>Kilograms</strong></td><td><strong>Rodents (estimated)</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border-left:1px solid #000000;border-right:1px solid #000000;border-top:1px solid #000000;padding:2px 3px;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom\">2016</td><td style=\"border-right:1px solid #000000;border-top:1px solid #000000;padding:2px 3px;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom\">27,550</td><td style=\"border-right:1px solid #000000;border-top:1px solid #000000;padding:2px 3px;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom\">1,967,857</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border-left:1px solid #000000;border-right:1px solid #000000;padding:2px 3px;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom\">2017</td><td style=\"border-right:1px solid #000000;padding:2px 3px;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom\">88,185</td><td style=\"border-right:1px solid #000000;padding:2px 3px;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom\">6,298,929</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border-left:1px solid #000000;border-right:1px solid #000000;padding:2px 3px;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom\">2018</td><td style=\"border-right:1px solid #000000;padding:2px 3px;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom\">119,507</td><td style=\"border-right:1px solid #000000;padding:2px 3px;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom\">8,536,214</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border-left:1px solid #000000;border-right:1px solid #000000;padding:2px 3px;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom\">2019</td><td style=\"border-right:1px solid #000000;padding:2px 3px;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom\">163,800</td><td style=\"border-right:1px solid #000000;padding:2px 3px;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom\">11,700,000</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border-left:1px solid #000000;border-right:1px solid #000000;padding:2px 3px;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom\">2020</td><td style=\"border-right:1px solid #000000;padding:2px 3px;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom\">187,700</td><td style=\"border-right:1px solid #000000;padding:2px 3px;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom\">13,407,143</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border-left:1px solid #000000;border-right:1px solid #000000;padding:2px 3px;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom\">2021</td><td style=\"border-right:1px solid #000000;padding:2px 3px;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom\">263,300</td><td style=\"border-right:1px solid #000000;padding:2px 3px;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom\">18,807,143</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border-left:1px solid #000000;border-right:1px solid #000000;padding:2px 3px;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom\">2022</td><td style=\"border-right:1px solid #000000;padding:2px 3px;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom\">403,000</td><td style=\"border-right:1px solid #000000;padding:2px 3px;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom\">28,785,714</td></tr><tr><td>2023 (annualized)</td><td style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #000000;border-left:1px solid #000000;border-right:1px solid #000000;padding:2px 3px;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom\">618,000</td><td style=\"border-bottom:1px solid #000000;border-right:1px solid #000000;padding:2px 3px;text-align:center;vertical-align:bottom\">44,142,857</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>The large US importers are primarily the major distribution companies and farms.

We heard from one smaller farm in the US that the main input into costs is labor, but it is possible on a large scale commercial farm or in markets with cheaper labor costs that feed and bedding also

more expensive than this: on RodentPro.com pinky mice are sold for $0.34 each, and jumbo mice are sold for $0.99 each. To purchase frozen rodents online, the customer has to purchase enough to justify the substantial cost of being shipped on dry ice. Customers will therefore usually have freezers where they can store the reptile food. If a customer wants to purchase from a local store prices are even higher. One local reptile store we visited sold pinkie mice for $1.30 each and adult mice for $1.80 each. At PetCo, a large national pet store, pinky mice were sold for $2.16 each and large mice for $4.75 each</p><h2><strong>Customers</strong></h2><p>Globally, the vast majority of feeder rodents are being fed to pet snakes in private homes, pet stores, and reptile breeding facilities. We estimate that there are 7 to 11 million pet snakes in the world, a number that has increased significantly in the last few years over Covid. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.americanpetproducts.org/data-research/industry-trends-and-stats\"><u>US survey</u></a> from the American Pet Products Association found that the number of reptile owning households grew 33% from 2020 to 2023, and has doubled since 2012. We believe that zoos and wildlife rehab centers for birds of prey are the only other major customers for feeder rodents, and we estimate that they comprise between 2% and 20% of total farmed feeder rodent consumption. We found no evidence that carnivorous animal farms, whether crocodilian or snake, represent a significant portion of farmed feeder rodent sales, instead relying on formulated diets composed of animal agriculture byproducts and some vegetable protein.</p><h1>Welfare Considerations</h1><p>In their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pGwR2xc39PMSPa6qv/rodents-farmed-for-pet-snake-food#Welfare_concerns\"><u>2019 article</u></a>, saulius highlights many of the welfare concerns that we also encountered during our research for this paper including lack of space, shelter, daylight and activities, along with the fact that these rodents generally live in their feces and are sometimes fed live to snakes. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.peta.org/features/rat-snake-investigation-california-dealer-warehouse/\"><u>PETA investigation</u></a> into what we would classify as a small local farm also highlighted the disturbing conditions that these rodents face, including ineffective and cruel euthanasia methods and drowning. Some other welfare concerns are listed below.</p><h2><strong>Infanticide</strong></h2><p>Infanticide and cannibalism&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mousebehavior.org/infanticide/\"><u>can be common</u></a> in mice and other rodents.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infanticide_in_rodents\"><u>There also may be some evidence</u></a> that increases in stress can induce higher rates of matricide or infanticide. During our visit to a rodent farm, the farmer said that it was \u201cvery common\u201d to pull out a tub and find that there had been a \u201crampage\u201d where a mother killed children. It was also common, he told us, for female mice to kill pups that were not their own, and for adult males to engage in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@daringgreatly1/video/7267161752599645483\"><u>aggressive behavior towards each other</u></a>. Rodents that are wounded from these encounters, but not killed, may have to wait days or up to a week to be found by the farmers, and when found either euthanized or, as we witnessed at this farm when a bloody mouse was found in a tub, thrown into a bucket to be discarded alive.</p><h2><strong>Injury and Disease</strong></h2><p>A few of the breeders that we talked to expressed that they purposefully let disease and viruses run through their colonies because it developed a hardier and more effective breeding line. One farmer we spoke with said that some of these diseases, like mange or ringworm, can cause open wounds for the rodents. Treatment of disease is extremely rare given that any individual rodent has little economic value. Any rodent with physical disfigurations from disease or fighting that would exclude it from being sold is therefore discarded rather than treated.&nbsp;</p><p>There are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.foodsafetynews.com/2023/04/deadly-salmonella-outbreak-linked-to-pet-snakes-and-feeder-rodents/\"><u>frequent</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/30/business/global/30mice.html\"><u>Salmonella outbreaks</u></a> tied to feeder rodents, and there is at least&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3901486/\"><u>one instance</u></a> in the academic literature of a large-scale cull of feeder mice due to Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus (LCMV), likely on a RodentPro farm. Some of the breeders we talked to purposefully kept \u201cdirty\u201d colonies, meaning there were minimal biosecurity measures in place. One operator of a small breeder farm said that he purposefully allowed wild mice or rats to interbreed with his colonies to increase the natural disease resistance of his rodents. In his words, \u201cno one cares if the mice have a sniffly nose every so often.\u201d&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Slaughter Methods</strong></h2><p><a href=\"https://petadvocacy.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Feeder-Rodent-Best-Management-Practices.pdf\"><u>There are no regulations that govern euthanasia for feeder rodents.</u></a> Some of the larger operations may be governed by AVMA standards if they choose to sell to zoos which have an AZA accreditation. However, it seems unlikely that purchasing zoos inspect the feeder rodent facility before they purchase, and there is no evidence that the AZA certifies feeder rodent operations.&nbsp;</p><p>Regardless, we estimate that 15-33% of feeder rodent production is local, on small distributed farms or hobbyists\u2019 basements. These small farms and individuals are not supplying zoos and thus have no commercial need to adhere to AVMA standards. It does appear that some of these rodents are euthanized using CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation, but many of these will not be killed in CO<sub>2</sub> chambers that are filled with a regulated flow.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2020-02/Guidelines-on-Euthanasia-2020.pdf\"><u>According to the AVMA</u></a>, unregulated flow of CO<sub>2</sub> can be painful for the rodent if the flow rate is too high or can cause distressing shortness of breath if too low. Our visit to a small rodent breeder, described below, demonstrates that AVMA guidelines are not always followed.</p><h1><strong>Our visit to a breeder</strong></h1><p>We visited one small local reptile store with a rodent breeding operation in a back room, likely with over 1,000 rodents that were used to feed the reptiles in the store, and which were sold live to customers. We were very surprised about how open the store was to sharing details about their operation. Given that feeder rodents have not received much attention from animal activists, it\u2019s possible that feeder rodent producers are generally less guarded, although some of the large producers we talked to definitely were concerned about increased attention leading to regulation. The door to the breeding room was kept open and was visible to customers as they walked in. The main operator of the breeding room seemed eager to show off his breeding system, and gave us a tour when we expressed interest. During this tour, we witnessed some disturbing cruelty:</p><ul><li>Each plastic bin containing rodents was partially transparent. In the corner of many bins, under the litter bed there were what seemed to be partial or full carcasses of dead rodents that had not been removed, and which had been gradually pushed into the corners.</li><li>When the operator opened the first mouse bin, there was a dead bloody mouse, who was likely attacked by another mouse in the bin. The unphased operator picked the mouse carcass up and tossed it casually into the large trash bin in the center of the room.</li><li>While the operator was talking to us, an owner of the store came to take around ten rats to be fed to the reptiles in the store. Making no effort to conceal his actions in front of strangers, he picked each rat up by the tail and swung their body against a metal beam on the bin rack in order to kill them. He then tossed each mouse into a small plastic container, where we noticed some were not fully dead, but just injured or knocked out.</li><li>The operator bragged that he had selectively bred his rats to be more docile so that they wouldn\u2019t bite him. To demonstrate this, he picked up multiple large rats and handled them roughly, holding them close to his face and petting them aggressively to demonstrate that they would not bite him.</li></ul><h1>Paths to Impact</h1><p>We have identified two interventions that we believe could help feeder rodents.</p><h2><strong>Public pressure campaigns against zoos</strong></h2><p>Mirroring the success of corporate campaigns in encouraging egg producers to convert to cage-free production, it may be effective to target downstream purchasers of bulk frozen rodents to enforce welfare standards on their suppliers. AZA accredited zoos in the US seem like the best target for this. Since many zoos are publicly owned, some of their frozen rodent purchase orders are publicly visible (see for example&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.springfieldmo.gov/DocumentCenter/View/27944/TAB-142-2017RFQ-Feeder-Animals?bidId=\"><u>Springfield 2017</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.springfieldmo.gov/DocumentCenter/View/52352/TAB-066-2021-Feeder-Animals?bidId=\"><u>2021</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.clevelandmetroparks.com/getmedia/f9967df6-e5eb-4c1c-a152-839dd3b6b462/PROPETS-PRICE-SHEET.pdf.ashx.ashx\"><u>Cleveland 2017</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/63ec3dc1fecdda25c95f6f39/t/653142651f6e9d635b65fd5f/1697727082777/Tabulation_Packet_for_FB-00325.pdf\"><u>Miami 2016</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/63ec3dc1fecdda25c95f6f39/t/65314223b3923c727bb2952a/1697727012229/FB+23-165+Frozen+Whole+%28E%29.PDF\"><u>Boise 2023</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/63ec3dc1fecdda25c95f6f39/t/651f27ece75cea2c24b78835/1696540653101/Norfolk2023.pdf\"><u>Norfolk 2023</u></a>). Since zoos purchase in bulk, they generally use the larger rodent producers such as RodentPro. Zoos could account for up to 20% of frozen rodent consumption, so may be able to effectively pressure their suppliers to implement basic welfare standards and comply with third party audits. Additionally, supporters of zoos may care about animal welfare, making zoos good targets for public pressure campaigns. We\u2019re not sure what the desired outcome should be, but there could be welfare standards from lab rodents bred for experimentation that could be easily ported over to feeder mice. Alternatively, zoos could be pressured to use alternative products, like the ones discussed below.</p><h2><strong>Alternatives to whole animal feeding</strong></h2><p>Mirroring the success of alternative proteins as a method to help animals, it\u2019s possible that in the future alternative methods of feeding could become more common, such as through sausages. There\u2019s many examples in the academic literature of snakes being fed homemade sausages instead of whole rodents (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bioone.org/journals/journal-of-herpetological-medicine-and-surgery/volume-30/issue-3/19-01-182.1/Preliminary-Evaluation-of-a-Novel-Insect-Based-Sausage-Diet-for/10.5818/19-01-182.1.short\"><u>here</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sciendo.com/article/10.5372/1905-7415.0503.043?content-tab=abstract\"><u>here</u></a>). Additionally, there\u2019s a company called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://reptilinks.com/\"><u>Reptilinks</u></a> that does this (feeding example&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5n9C6b2Bog&amp;t=684s\"><u>here</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>We\u2019ve heard that there are some challenges with feeding snakes sausages as opposed to whole animals. Firstly, snakes can be very picky eaters, and sausages won\u2019t always trigger their predatory instinct. That said, we\u2019ve heard this can be a problem for all feeding methods, and it\u2019s not clear how much worse this is for sausages compared to other methods. Reptilinks recommends getting around this by applying mouse or chicken essential oils to the casing of the sausage. Secondly, we\u2019ve heard that snakes can sometimes \u201cattack\u201d their prey before eating, sometimes causing the sausage casing to rupture. However, this seems like a solvable problem with some product development.&nbsp;</p><p>On snake owner forums, and in discussions with snake owners, it seems like Reptilinks has a lukewarm reputation. Some other problems we\u2019ve heard about include:</p><ul><li>Many consumers think Reptilinks is more expensive than whole animal feeding. However, Reptilinks claims that their products are more calorie dense, meaning that snakes need to be fed less often.</li><li>Many snake owners worry about the health of their snakes on a sausage-based diet. There seems to be a belief in the snake owning community that complete snake nutrition must include things like bone, connective tissue, and organs. To counter this worry, Reptilinks&nbsp;<a href=\"https://reptilinks.com/pages/the-links\"><u>claims</u></a> that their sausages include \u201cwhole prey,\u201d and are \u201crigorously lab tested by the Ohio Department of Agriculture.\u201d</li></ul><p>Despite Reptilinks\u2019 reputation, it seems to us like the status quo of whole animal feeding should in theory be extremely unpleasant for most people. Often, snake owners will keep frozen rodents in their main freezer, where they also keep food for human consumption. When feeding, snake owners need to thaw each rodent out in warm water before feeding. If the snake doesn\u2019t eat the rodent right away, some snake owners will dangle the rodent by the tail in front of the snake for up to 15 minutes. Others may cut the rodent\u2019s carcass open to make it more appealing to the snake. It seems implausible on its face that consumers would elect to keep doing this if there were more pleasant options available.</p><p>That said, in all of our conversations, snake owners seem to get used to this process very quickly, and aren\u2019t actively looking for alternatives. In some cases, there is a sense among experienced snake owners that if you don\u2019t have the stomach to go through the feeding process, you have no business owning snakes. Therefore, it may be more effective for a sausage product to be marketed towards new snake owners that haven\u2019t yet gotten used to the standard feeding methods.</p><p>It seems like there are ways that Reptilinks\u2019 products could be improved. They use very expensive ingredients, possibly to combat the worry about snake health. However, a sausage that used primarily contained byproducts of animal agriculture could be substantially cheaper. Additionally, Reptilinks sausages are stored frozen and shipped on dry ice, significantly adding to the cost. In theory, it should be possible to create a shelf-stable sausage product that would be significantly cheaper to ship. It\u2019s also possible that sausages stored at room temp could be packaged in an oily or liquidy environment (like cat food or tuna) leading to more prominent volatiles which could help with the feeding challenges.</p><p>It\u2019s likely that sausages would need to be filled with animal products, at least in the beginning. If these animal products were mainly byproducts, or products from larger animals like cows, this would likely still be a huge win for animal welfare. However, one snake expert we spoke with pointed out that our scientific knowledge of snake nutrition is underdeveloped, and it\u2019s possible a healthy snake's diets could involve a substantial amount of plant-based materials. One piece of evidence in favor of this is that farmed crocodile diets&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28363051/\"><u>can involve</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37904841/\"><u>up to 100%</u></a> soy protein, in order to keep costs down. This could be an important area of further research.</p><h1>Urgency</h1><p>Now might be a particularly good time to prioritize the welfare of feeder rodents, given the overlap with in-ovo sexing,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.innovateanimalag.org/in-ovo-sexing-2023-in-review\"><u>which is becoming more common in Europe</u></a>. In countries where day-old male chicks are primarily culled via gassing rather than maceration, their bodies remain intact, allowing them to be sold as feed for snakes, birds of prey, and other animals that generally eat whole animals.&nbsp;</p><p>The UK government\u2019s Animal Welfare Committee recently issued an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/opinion-on-chick-culling-alternatives\"><u>opinion</u></a> endorsing the use of in-ovo sexing as an alternative to male chick culling. However, it also noted that if the UK banned male culling as some countries in the EU have, this might increase demand for imported rodents. According to the report, 70% of the male layer chicks killed in Great Britain go to two large wholesalers that then freeze them and sell them as animal food. 60% of these chicks go to feed raptors in a variety of settings, 30% to zoos that use them to feed a range of species, and 5% to reptiles kept as pets. Many of the paths to impact noted here for pet snakes could also be used in theory for rodents that are fed to raptors and other birds of prey.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>If you\u2019re interested in possibly working on either of these interventions, please don\u2019t hesitate to send me a direct message here on the forum!</p>", "user": {"username": "reyeahman0920"}}, {"_id": "FKWYNcWixfuJK3D7z", "title": "#182 \u2013  Comparing the welfare of humans, chickens, pigs, octopuses, bees, and more (Bob Fischer on the 80,000 Hours Podcast)", "postedAt": "2024-03-13T16:54:51.152Z", "htmlBody": "<p>We just published an interview: <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/bob-fischer-comparing-animal-welfare-moral-weight/\">Bob Fischer on comparing the welfare of humans, chickens, pigs, octopuses, bees, and&nbsp;more</a>. <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/7k1kujIhJgMMOLvT7glSVV\">Listen on Spotify</a> or click through for other audio options, the transcript, and related links.

Can you give a quick summary of why they think that?</p><p><strong>Bob Fischer:</strong> Sure. There are two things to say. One is that it isn\u2019t totally crazy to use neuron counts. And one way of seeing why you might think it\u2019s not totally crazy is to think about the kinds of proxies that economists have used when trying to estimate human welfare. Economists have for a long time used income as a proxy for human welfare. You might say that we know that there are all these ways in which that fails as a proxy \u2014 and the right response from the economist is something like, do you have anything better? Where there\u2019s actually data, and where we can answer at least some of these high-level questions that we care about? Or at least make progress on the high-level questions that we care about relative to baseline?</p><p>And I think that way of thinking about what neuron-count-based proxies are is the charitable interpretation. It\u2019s just like income in welfare economics: imperfect, but maybe the best we can do in certain circumstances.</p><p>That being said, the main problem is that there are lots of factors that really affect neuron count as a proxy that make it problematic. One is that neuron counts alone are really sensitive to body size, so that\u2019s going to be a confounding factor. It seems like, insofar as it tracks much of anything, it might be tracking something like intelligence \u2014 and it\u2019s not totally obvious why intelligence is morally important. At least in the human case, we often think that it\u2019s not important, and in fact, it\u2019s a really pernicious thing to make intelligence the metric by which we assess moral value.</p><p>And then, even if you think that neuron counts are proxies of some quality for something else, like the intensity of pain states or something\u2026 It\u2019s not clear that that\u2019s true, but even if that were true, you\u2019d still have to ask, can we do any better? And it\u2019s not obvious that we can\u2019t do better. Not obvious that we can, but we should at least try.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Yes. Makes sense. Are there any helpful thought experiments there? It doesn\u2019t seem at all insane to me \u2014 though maybe you wouldn\u2019t expect it to happen on its own through evolution \u2014 that there would be a being who has many fewer neurons than I do, but that those neurons are primarily directed at going from extreme pain to extreme something like euphoria. It doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s a good reason that\u2019s not possible, and that that extreme pain could just be much more than the total amount of pain I could possibly feel. Even though the types of pain might be different for me, because I\u2019ve got different kinds of capacities for sadness and shame and embarrassment, like a wider variety of types of pain, it still seems at least theoretically possible that you could house a bunch of pain in a small brain. And that feels like good reason to me to basically do what you\u2019ve done, which is look for better ways than neurons alone.</p><p><strong>Bob Fischer:</strong> Sure. And some evolutionary biologists have basically said things along these lines. Richard Dawkins actually has <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RichardDawkins/status/1420985461779042311\">this line</a> at some point, where he says maybe simpler organisms actually need stronger pain signals because they don\u2019t learn as much as we do and they don\u2019t remember all these facts, so they need big alarm bells to keep them away from fitness-reducing threats. So it\u2019s always possible that you have a complete inversion of the relationship that people imagine, and you want to make sure that your model captures that.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>How to think about the moral weight of a chicken</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Cool. Just to make sure I understand, the thing is saying that the capacity of welfare or suffering of a chicken in a given instant is about a third of the capacity for the kind of pain and pleasure a human could experience in a given instant. Is that it?</p><p><strong>Bob Fischer:</strong> That\u2019s the way to think about it. And that might sound very counterintuitive, and I understand that. I think there are a couple of things we can say to help get us in the right frame of mind for thinking about these results.</p><p>One is to think about it first like a biologist. If you think that humans\u2019 pain is orders of magnitude worse than the pain of a chicken, you\u2019ve got to point to some feature of human brains that\u2019s going to explain why that would be the case. And I think for a lot of folks, they have a kind of simple picture \u2014 where they say more neurons equals more compute equals orders of magnitude difference in performance, or something like that.</p><p>And biologists are not going to think that way. They\u2019re going to say, look, neurons produce certain functions, and the number of neurons isn\u2019t necessarily that important to the function: you might achieve the exact same function using many more or many fewer neurons. So that\u2019s just not the really interesting, relevant thing. So that\u2019s the first step: just to try to think more like a biologist who\u2019s focused on functional capacities.</p><p>The second thing to say is just that you\u2019ve got to remember what hedonism says. What\u2019s going on here is we\u2019re assuming that welfare is about just this one narrow thing: the intensities of pleasures and pains. You might not think that\u2019s true; you might think welfare is about whether I know important facts about the world or whatever else, right? But that\u2019s not what I\u2019m assessing; I\u2019m just looking at this question of how intense is the pain.</p><p>And you might also point out, quite rightly, \u201cBut look, my cognitive life is richer. I have a more diverse range of negatively valenced states.\u201d And I\u2019m going to say that I don\u2019t care about the range; I care about the intensity, right? That\u2019s what hedonism says, is that what matters is how intense the pains are. So yeah, \u201cI\u2019m very disappointed because\u2026\u201d \u2014 choose unhappy event of your preference \u2014 \u201c\u2026my favourite team lost,\u201d whatever the case may be. And from the perspective of hedonism, what matters about that is just how sad did it make me? Not the <i>content</i> of the experience, but just the amount of negatively valenced state that I\u2019m experiencing, or rather the intensity of the negatively valenced state that I\u2019m experiencing. So I think people often implicitly confuse variety in the range of valenced states with intensity.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>If these moral weights make you uncomfortable\u2026</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Bob Fischer:</strong> I think the thing that helps me to some degree is to say, look, we\u2019re doing our best here under moral uncertainty. I think you should update in the direction of animals based on this kind of work if you\u2019ve never taken animals particularly seriously before.</p><p>But ethics is hard. There are lots of big questions to ask. I don\u2019t know if hedonism is true. I mean, there are good arguments for it; there are good arguments for all the assumptions that go into the project. But yeah, I\u2019m uncertain at every step, and some kind of higher-level caution about the entire venture is appropriate. And if you look at the way people actually allocate their dollars, they often do spread their bets in precisely this way. Even if they\u2019re really in on animals, they\u2019re still giving some money to AMF. And that makes sense, because we want to make sure that we end up doing some good in the world, and that\u2019s a way of doing that.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> I guess I\u2019m curious if there\u2019s anything you learned, like a narrative or story that you have that makes this feel more plausible to you? You\u2019ve already said some things, but what story do you have in your head that makes you feel comfortable being like, \u201cYes, I actually want to use these moral weights when deciding how to allocate resources\u201d?</p><p><strong>Bob Fischer:</strong> There are two things that I want to say about that. One is I really worry about my own deep biases, and part of the reason that I\u2019m willing to be part of the EA project is because I think that, at its best, it\u2019s an attempt to say, \u201cYeah, my gut\u2019s wrong. I shouldn\u2019t trust it. I should take the math more seriously. I should try to put numbers on things and calculate. And when I\u2019m uncomfortable with the results, I\u2019m typically the problem, and not the process that I used.\u201d So that\u2019s one thing. It\u2019s a check on my own tendency to discount animals, even as someone who spends most of their life working on animals. So I think that\u2019s one piece.</p><p>The other thing is just to spend time thinking about the kinds of things animals can do and what their lives are like. Just how hard a chicken will work to get to a nest box before she lays an egg, the amount of labour she\u2019s willing to go through to do that, to think about how important that is to her. And to realise that we can quantify that, and see how much they care, or to see that they get stressed out when fellow chickens are threatened and that they seem to have some sympathy for conspecifics.</p><p>Those kinds of things make me say there is something in there that is recognisable to me as another individual, with desires and preferences and a vantage point on the world, who wants things to go a certain way and is frustrated and upset when they don\u2019t. And recognising the individuality, the perspective of nonhuman animals, for me, really challenges my tendency to not take them as seriously as I think I ought to, all things considered.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>The moral weight of bees</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Yeah, and I was going to do something you probably wouldn\u2019t like, which is do the math and say something like that means that if I\u2019ve got train tracks and I\u2019ve got a human on one side, that means putting 14 bees on the other side. And obviously that\u2019s not taking into account the length of their lives, so that actually isn\u2019t the kind of moral outcome you\u2019d endorse. But trading off an hour of suffering for those two groups feels even more uncomfortable to me. And it sounds like the thing you\u2019d actually stand by is not this kind of 1-to-14, 7% figure, but something like 1-to-100, a couple of orders of magnitude. And even that, I\u2019m still like, \u201cA hundred bees?!\u201d I like bees, but wow.</p><p><strong>Bob Fischer:</strong> Sure, totally. Again, a couple of things to say. One is that I do think size bias is real. Imagine if bees were the size of rhinos, and you never had to worry about getting stung. You\u2019d probably be pretty into bees all of a sudden. I think we are just affected by the fact that they\u2019re little and they feel very replaceable, we can\u2019t really observe their behaviours, et cetera. So that\u2019s one thing to say.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Interesting. OK, so just kind of imagine a really big, fluffy bumblebee buzzing around, being adorable, not stinging you. Yeah, fair enough. I feel like I\u2019d be like, \u201cThat thing is cute and important and I\u2019ve gotta protect it.\u201d</p><p><strong>Bob Fischer:</strong> I know it\u2019s an uncomfortable fact about human psychology that we care about all the wrong things. But anyway, that\u2019s one thing to say.</p><p>Second thing to say is that, again, the welfare range estimate is a factor here. The background commitment to something like utilitarianism or welfarist consequentialism, that\u2019s doing a lot of the work. We\u2019re just committed to aggregation if we\u2019re doing this kind of thing, and there\u2019s going to be some number of bees where you\u2019re supposed to flip the lever and kill the human \u2014 and that, again, might just make you uncomfortable. If it does, that\u2019s not my fault. That\u2019s a function of the moral theory, not a function of the welfare range estimate.</p><p>And the third thing to say is: I do think it\u2019s really important just to learn more about these animals. And of course, bees in particular are very charismatic and cute. And you could go and <a href=\"https://youtu.be/EB4CJrAGnA0?si=Yp7m61EcwvZAAW0C\">watch Lars Chittka</a>, who\u2019s a bee scientist, and he\u2019s got these lovely little videos of bees playing and rolling balls around, and it\u2019s adorable. And of course, you can feel lots of sympathy for bees if you watch those kinds of things.</p><p>But for me, those actually are not the most interesting cases and compelling cases. For me, it\u2019s the fact that when you look at Drosophila \u2014 fruit flies, closely related to black soldier flies \u2014 they\u2019re used as depression models for studying humans, as pain models. And you read all these papers, there are a million of them, and they will say, \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how similar the neurology of these organisms is to humans! They\u2019re such a perfect model, or such a useful model for understanding these aspects of the most excruciating and terrible human experiences. Isn\u2019t it great that what we can now do is starve them and put them through sleeplessness and all kinds of things, and guess what? They get depressed. And that\u2019s such a great way of studying these horrible symptoms, some of the worst symptoms that humans ever experience.\u201d</p><p>So when you see that kind of thing in the literature, and you see the excitement of researchers thinking about these organisms as ways of understanding humans, and seeing the behavioural implications for these organisms, you start to think, man, there\u2019s something going on in that creature that should make me really uncomfortable.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Do octopuses have nine minds?</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Bob Fischer:</strong> There are actually a lot of animals where it isn\u2019t clear that they have the same kind of unified minds that we think of ourselves as having \u2014 open question whether humans have the same kind of unified minds that we think of ourselves as having. But you don\u2019t have the same structures in birds, for instance, between the hemispheres. And you have this kind of distributed cognition, apparently, in octopuses. And you might think, does that mean that you don\u2019t just have one welfare subject in a chicken? Maybe you\u2019ve got two, one for each hemisphere. Or maybe you don\u2019t have one welfare subject, one entity of moral concern, in an octopus: maybe you\u2019ve got nine. And of course, that would really change the moral weight that you assigned to that organism. So that\u2019s why we investigated.</p><p>Then the upshot is we basically don\u2019t think you should say that. The short reason is that you want to think functionally about the mind: you want to think about what the overall organism is accomplishing with the ability that it has. And we should assume by default that these organisms evolved to be coordinated systems that are trying to accomplish the collective ends in the world. And I say \u201ccollective\u201d as though we\u2019re thinking about the parts as separate individuals \u2014 but of course, that\u2019s exactly what\u2019s being contested. And the idea is, once we think about things that way, it becomes a lot less plausible that there\u2019d be an evolutionary reason for things to work in the way that it has these multiple minds. And we think that the empirical evidence itself just isn\u2019t good enough to overcome that fundamental sort of default hypothesis.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Can you clarify why we think octopuses might have multiple minds?</p><p><strong>Bob Fischer:</strong> Yeah. So in the case of octopuses, part of it is just the concentration, the sheer number of neurons in the arms. Part of it is behavioural \u2014 if you watch videos of octopuses, you can see examples of this \u2014 where it\u2019ll look like arms are kind of operating independently, roving and exploring and reaching out on their own, and they don\u2019t seem to be coordinated with what\u2019s happening with the main attention of the organism, and they\u2019re still off doing their own thing. And that gives people pause and they start to think, is it the case that all these neurons are acting in some semi-coordinated way, independently of what\u2019s happening at the main site of cognition?</p><p>And <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10539-017-9604-0\">people have written</a> some <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Metazoa-Animal-Life-Birth-Mind/dp/0374207941/\">speculative pieces</a> about this. Of course it\u2019s very hard to test. Of course many of the tests would be horrible. Lots of reasons to think this is either a difficult question to answer, or one that, insofar as we could answer it, perhaps we should not try. But it just looks like it would be really hard to show that that was the case, rather than some more modest hypothesis about the ability to sense more thoroughly through the appendage or whatever.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Right. And why is the theory that it\u2019s multiple minds rather than something like multitasking? I feel like you could make a similar observation about me when I\u2019m cooking, and also having a conversation, and also\u2026 I don\u2019t know, maybe that\u2019s the most I can do at once. But something like my hands are doing something while it seems like I\u2019m thoroughly mentally engaged in something else?</p><p><strong>Bob Fischer:</strong> Well, maybe it\u2019s easier as a case study to think about birds. Where in humans, when you sever the corpus callosum \u2014 the thing that connects the two hemispheres \u2014 you do get these gaps where the hemispheres seem to operate in an uncoordinated way. And you have people report that they don\u2019t know what the other hemisphere ostensibly seems to know, based on the behaviour that they\u2019re engaging in. And so if you don\u2019t have that structure in a bird, you might then wonder, is what you have here effectively a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Split-brain\">split-brain</a> patient all the time? And then there are these interesting cases, like dolphins, where they seem to have one hemisphere able to go into a sleep mode while the other hemisphere is awake.</p><p>And seeing those kinds of things in other species can make you wonder whether there\u2019s just a very different organisational principle at work in those minds. So if that\u2019s your background context, then seeing this really distributed set of neurons in an octopus, and then seeing the behaviour that looks not entirely coordinated, et cetera, can motivate the idea of multiple minds. But admittedly, it\u2019s speculative stuff, a really complicated set of questions. The work on that is in early days, so it\u2019s not like I think there\u2019s some super strong case that one might have had for that view.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>What might you care about if you're risk averse?</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Bob Fischer:</strong> If you\u2019re just comparing humans, chickens, and shrimp, and you\u2019re a straight expected value maximiser, well of course shrimp win because there are trillions of them, so even given very small moral weights for shrimp, they just dominate.</p><p>Now suppose that you are worst-case scenario risk averse. Well, now the case for shrimp looks even better than it did before if you were a straight expected value maximiser.</p><p>But then suppose you go in for one of those other two forms of risk aversion: you\u2019re worried about difference making or you don\u2019t really like ambiguity. Well, those penalised shrimp, and maybe quite a lot \u2014 to the point where the human causes look a lot better than the shrimp causes.</p><p>The really interesting thing is that chickens actually look really good across the various types of risk aversion. So if you\u2019re a straight expected value maximiser, the shrimp beat the chickens. But once you\u2019ve got one of those other kinds of risk aversion in play \u2014 you\u2019re worried about difference making or ambiguity \u2014 actually chickens look really good, and they even beat the human causes. And the reason for that is really simple: it\u2019s just that there are so many chickens and we think they probably matter a fair amount.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Yeah, interesting. So it\u2019s like if you have some moderate amount of risk aversion, you might think intuitively that that\u2019s going to rule out the animal welfare interventions. And in fact, that\u2019s just not what happens.</p><p>How sensitive are these results, broadly? Maybe the best way to answer that question is just like, how close are chicken interventions to being beat out by one of these other two \u2014 such that is it possible that someone could just have slightly different beliefs to Rethink and all of a sudden humans end up looking much better? Or would you have to have <i>really</i> different beliefs to Rethink?</p><p><strong>Bob Fischer:</strong> You\u2019d have to have quite different views. So Laura Duffy did this <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/how-can-risk-aversion-affect-your-cause-prioritization\">wonderful report</a>. She tries to answer this question by looking at different weights that you could have for chickens, and seeing how robustly good chickens end up being, even if you think that they matter a lot less than the Moral Weight Project suggests. And she found, yeah, you could think that they were an order of magnitude less important \u2014 so instead of 30% as important, 3% \u2014 and still end up with this result that they look really good. So that\u2019s pretty striking.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>What if you're not a hedonist?</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> It sounds like we\u2019re both pretty sympathetic to hedonism. But let\u2019s say someone doesn\u2019t buy hedonism. Does that mean that the results of the Moral Weight Project in general aren\u2019t particularly relevant to how they decide how to spend their career and their money?</p><p><strong>Bob Fischer:</strong> Not at all, because any theory of welfare is going to give some weight to hedonic considerations, so you\u2019re still going to learn something about what matters from this kind of project. The question is just: how much of a welfare range do you think the hedonic portion is? Do you think it\u2019s a lot or do you think it\u2019s a little? And if you think it\u2019s a lot, then maybe you\u2019re learning a lot from this project. If you don\u2019t think that, learning less. But insofar as you\u2019re sympathetic to hedonism, learning about the hedonic differences is going to matter for your cause prioritisation.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Yeah. You have this thought experiment that you argue shows that non-hedonic goods and bads can\u2019t contribute that much to an individual\u2019s total welfare range, which you call, for a shorthand, <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/theories-of-welfare-and-welfare-range-estimates\">Tortured Tim</a>. Can you walk me through it? It\u2019s a bit complicated, but I think it\u2019s pretty interesting and worth doing.</p><p><strong>Bob Fischer:</strong> Sure. Well, the core idea is not that complicated. The way to think about it is: just imagine someone whose life is going as well as it can be in all the non-hedonic ways. They\u2019ve got tonnes of friends, they\u2019ve had lots of achievements, they know all sorts of important things, et cetera, et cetera. But they\u2019re being tortured, and they\u2019re being tortured to the point where they\u2019re in as much pain as they can be.</p><p>So now we can ask this question: is that life, is that individual, are they well off on balance, or is their life net negative? Is it, on the whole, bad, in that moment? And if you say it\u2019s on the whole bad, then you\u2019re saying, you could have all those great non-hedonic goods \u2014 all the knowledge and achievements and everything else \u2014 and they would not be enough to outweigh the intensity of that pain. So that suggests that having all those non-hedonic goods isn\u2019t actually more important, isn\u2019t a larger portion of the welfare range than the hedonic portion \u2014 and that kind of caps how much good you can be, in principle, getting from all the non-hedonic stuff.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Part of me is like, yes, I buy that. I can\u2019t imagine being tortured and still feeling like my love of knowledge and learning, and the fact that my family is out there and doing well, and I\u2019ve got friends who care about me, I can\u2019t really imagine having that outweigh the torture. On the other hand, is it insane to think that there are people being tortured who would prefer not to die because they value life deeply, inherently, or the knowledge of their family and friends and the world existing is worth existing for, despite immense pain? Maybe I\u2019m just not thinking about enough pain. Maybe there is just some extreme level of pain that, because I\u2019ve never experienced torture, I will not at all be able to fully intuit this.</p><p><strong>Bob Fischer:</strong> Sure. So there are a couple of things to say. One is, as a direct response to your question: no, it\u2019s not crazy. I mean, you can certainly imagine people who do have that view. I go to different universities and give talks about some of these issues, and I gave a talk about the Tortured Tim case at one university, and a guy just said, \u201cThis couldn\u2019t be further from my view. It\u2019s just obvious to me that Tim\u2019s life is not just worth living, that it\u2019s one of the better lives.\u201d</p><p>And the second thing to say is that maybe there\u2019s a problem in the thought experiment. Maybe it turns out that you can\u2019t really have the objective goods when you\u2019re being tortured. I mean, I don\u2019t really think that\u2019s that plausible, but you could imagine there being various philosophical moves that show that we\u2019re missing something here in the details.</p><p>So maybe the takeaway is just: think about how valuable these non-hedonic goods are. Maybe you think they\u2019re much more valuable than I suggest in that thought experiment, but at least maybe it provides a bound; at least maybe it challenges you to think that \u2014 at least given your views, the way you want to think about things \u2014 you shouldn\u2019t say that the non-hedonic goods are like 100x more important than the hedonic stuff. And as long as you don\u2019t say that, you\u2019re still getting some information from our project about just how important chickens are.</p><p><strong>Luisa Rodriguez:</strong> Yeah. When I try to make it really concrete, and actually step away from the thought experiment and think about chickens, and I\u2019m like, OK, it does seem like chickens probably have less capacity for the range of experiences that I have. They\u2019re not getting to learn mind-blowing stuff about philosophy the way I am. I am like, OK, but if in fact chickens, while being raised in factory farms, are regularly having their limbs broken, are sometimes starving, as soon as I\u2019m like, if that\u2019s anything like what that would be like for me \u2014 where you don\u2019t have to assume anything about whether there\u2019s also stuff about knowledge going on for chickens; it\u2019s just like, if their pain threshold is anything like my pain threshold, that alone is I think basically getting me to the point where I\u2019m like, yes, if I\u2019m living in those conditions, it doesn\u2019t matter that much to me whether I also, in theory, have the capacity for deep philosophical reasoning. And maybe that\u2019s not the whole story here, but that\u2019s the intuition this is trying to push. Does that feel right to you?</p><p><strong>Bob Fischer:</strong> Yeah, I think something like that is correct. I would just get there via a slightly different route, and would say something like: think about the experience of dealing with children, and what it\u2019s like to watch them be injured or to suffer. It\u2019s intensely gripping and powerful, and they have very few capacities of the kind that we\u2019re describing, and yet that suffering seems extraordinarily morally important. And when I try to look past the species boundary and say, oh look, this is suffering, and it\u2019s intense and it\u2019s acute, it\u2019s powerful. Does it seem like it matters? It just seems that yeah, clearly it does. Clearly it does.</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "80000_Hours"}}, {"_id": "A3iQv3yabzcugRFC5", "title": "We are sharing a new website template for AI Safety groups!", "postedAt": "2024-03-13T16:40:21.737Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Georgia Tech AI Safety Initiative and Princeton AI Alignment have very cool websites, which you can check out&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aisi.dev/\"><u>here</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/princeton.edu/princeton-ai-alignment\"><u>here</u></a>, respectively.

His breaths came hard and fast. \"He aimed a fucking shotgun at me!\" Sweat had formed droplets across his forehead, maybe due to his sprint, or maybe due to the terror he must surely feel.

His suggestion hit me like a ton of bricks.</i></p><p><i>Was he joking? He had just been threatened, and now he wanted me to look down the barrel of that shotgun? \"But\u2026 You just said they almost shot you?\" I couldn't hide my shock and fear.</i></p><p><i>\"Come on, Ulrik\u2026 You\u2019re white!\" I felt the ground shifting under my feet, as the lens through which I viewed the world was replaced with a new, much thicker and darker one, one that made everything look uncannily foreign to me.</i></p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>True story of my life, as far as I can recall (my memory might have exaggerated it a bit). That said, even if it was to be completely fabricated, it still does not detract from the points I will make below.&nbsp;</p><p>The story is just one of many opportunities I have been privileged to have, getting a small peek into the lived experiences of my PoC, female, gay, and/or friends with disabilities. I am mentioning this story both to make this more interesting to read, but also so you can understand better why I feel like I feel about DEI.</p><p>Let me give you another example of the kind of experiences I have had and the type of environments I am used to navigating: I used to work for a renewables consultancy in Bristol, UK. It was a super social workplace, lots of pub visits, and attending lots of parties with colleagues on the weekends. And I brought my female and PoC friends along to many of these events and it just felt&nbsp;<i>really nice</i>. My colleagues were&nbsp;<i>so</i> welcoming, tactful and respectful despite having lots of fun. Never, once, did an incident occur where it got awkward due to some \u201cDEI-type incident\u201d. I felt completely safe bringing any of my friends or family there: I knew my friends would also feel safe and welcome, which made me feel safe and welcome too.</p><p>If that sounds like magic to you - \u201chow can so many different people get along so well?!?!\u201d - then perhaps it is helpful to explain how&nbsp;<i>I</i> navigate in such diverse settings, mostly using an example of my whiteness. I think the way I act in diverse social settings might also let you understand why I have high expectations of others when it comes to \"DEI behavior\".</p><p>When I am interacting with a person of color (PoC), I am aware that their entire life experience is probably littered with similar, if perhaps not as extreme, experiences as the one Bob had in the vignette, above. I can further imagine that such frequent and repeated experiences of&nbsp; how one does not belong, or is not qualified or whatever the feeling they derived was, has created certain, strong emotional associations. So my friend Bob from the story above would probably get nervous about walking up to a random house (e.g. as part of some AI policy canvassing initiative in a state with lax gun laws) or perhaps might feel some discomfort of attending an all-white event, especially if they suspect that some, maybe most of the attendants are actively engaging in online discussions about genetic enhancement of PoC in poor countries between themselves.&nbsp;</p><p>This means that I try, often unsuccessfully, to check myself for any actions I can take that might trigger any such discomforts, whenever I might not be talking to a white, het cis and able-bodied man, online or offline. Obvious things to NOT do include but is far from limited to:</p><ul><li>Commenting on someone\u2019s visible disability</li><li>Making any action that can be related to how a person displays their gender</li><li>Commenting on or inquiring about someone\u2019s background (this one&nbsp;<i>is&nbsp;</i>a bit more complicated)</li></ul><p>\u201cOk Ulrik, excellent action-grabbing shotgun vignette and reasonable points - can you please get to the EA part?\u201c</p><p>In my experience, this type of triggering behavior by men and white folks is widespread in EA. And it makes my blood boil.</p><p>As I hinted at above, I come from this super privileged background, having lived in 6 different countries and have a generally super international, cosmopolitan, elite and third culture kid vibe circle of friends. But me being used to hanging out in these environments has set my expectations somewhat high: For example, I expect that when I bring a friend who is PoC to a party, that they will feel welcome there. I expect any discussion of politics or questions about people\u2019s background to be sensitive and complying to certain unwritten codes of conduct in cosmopolitan, elitist circles.&nbsp;</p><p>A few examples of my bad experiences in EA (and this is from me generally steering clear of EA events because I have been disappointed so many times now):</p><ul><li>I brought my significant other (SO) to an EA party and another guest kept on commenting awkwardly and rudely on the height difference between my SO and I</li><li>In another of my encounters with EA, another EA asked where a non-EA PoC (also present) was from. When the EA was told \u201cSweden\u201d (which was true, birth, citizenship and fluency in Swedish) the EA pressed on wanting to know where the PoC was&nbsp;<i>really</i> from</li><li>At the only EAG I attended, and to almost the first PoC I talked to there, I was told this EA PoC was during one of the first EA events they attended asked by another EA where they came from and this EA PoC subsequently had a very rough \"onboarding\" into EA in large parts due to this incident</li><li>EAF posts on eugenics (e.g. posts like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/ives-parr?from=post_header\"><u>this&nbsp;</u></a>by white people on eugenics in poor, non-white countries)</li><li>Of course all the Bostrom emails, inappropriate sexual behavior and what not</li></ul><p>And I understand that many EAs have not been as privileged as me in terms of diversity of experience and I try to have compassion for this as well. You could probably even argue that my elitism is a form of discrimination I project onto EAs of lower socioeconomic status and you might be right. This is why I try as much as possible to approach this subject with humility, patience and empathy. But please forgive me for slipping up as I assuredly will - I get quite worked up around this because these patterns of behavior affect so many people close to me. And this post is not meant to be inoffensive - it is an attempt to describe how I feel and thus, I must be honest.</p><p>Quite frankly I am embarrassed to be an EA and afraid to bring people close to me to EA events. But I know of no better alternatives to EA, and there are many fantastic EAs who get me and I would feel safe bringing them home to hang out with my friends and family.</p><p>Bored of my rant? Ok, time for another of Ulrik's life stories then:</p><blockquote><p><i>Perched on the edge of my seat aboard a flight, possibly from Berlin to Stockholm, I found myself beside a man who seemed like he'd stepped right out of a Hollywood thriller. With a long beard, traditional Arab headgear, and a flowing white robe, he fit the stereotype of a movie's Muslim terrorist antagonist to a tee. He was engrossed in his laptop, fingers flying over keys as he pored over a document in Arabic. Curiosity piqued, I couldn't help but wonder: What was he reading so intently? A plan of some sort?</i></p><p><i>Shaking off the intrusive thought, I returned to my book, the flight progressing smoothly without incident or turbulence.</i></p><p><i>As we began our descent, with the cabin preparing for landing, I caught a glimpse of my seatmate closing his laptop with a sense of finality and retrieving something from his bag. He bowed his head, lips moving silently. Stealing another glance, I realized he was praying, not just any prayer, but with an intensity I'd never witnessed. The fervor of his supplication set alarm bells ringing in my mind, an irrational fear seizing me: Was he about to commit an unthinkable act?</i></p><p><i>My breathing turned rapid, shallow, a flood of adrenaline sharpening my senses to an excruciating degree. The Arabic phrases, the sweat on his brow\u2014it all painted a terrifying scenario in my mind, one where we were moments away from the plane turning into a fireball before slamming into the ground - perhaps the Swedish parliament.</i></p><p><i>In the grips of panic, a sliver of reason managed to break through. \"Ulrik, calm down. There's no danger here. He's just scared of flying, nothing more.\" Clinging to this lifeline of logic helped me fight the overwhelming urge to sound an alarm. It kept me seated, silent, avoiding a potential disaster born from misunderstanding and fear.</i></p><p><i>The tempest of panic and anxiety raged on within me, but that single, rational thought was a beacon in the storm, preventing a knee-jerk reaction that could have led to chaos. And when my fear subsided, I was awash in shame.</i></p></blockquote><p>I never talked to the man next to me on the plane. Come to think of it, I am not sure I even acknowledged his presence at all (I feel embarrassed writing this, my white fragility protesting). It was probably at least some part of unconscious bias that made me reluctant to reach out to him - he&nbsp;<i>felt</i> so different to me. So I do not know his name, and he probably had no idea of the emotional roller-coaster I was going through next to him. He was probably just shit scared of flying, or really worried he would have problems in immigration due to his appearances - for all I know he might well be born in Sweden despite his \u201cunswedish\u201d appearance. And he probably thought I was just another stuck-up white dude!</p><p>So, as the above example from my life illustrates: I am not on some moral high horse. I get it. Similarly to how some PoCs might have uncomfortable associations with white-only settings, biases against PoCs are hard wired into our emotional responses. So we are just a bunch of primates, ravaged by emotional drives, trying to get along. I am by no means infallible, I probably fail on a daily basis by engaging in default male, white, het cis and abelist behavior.&nbsp;</p><p>Still, I care.</p><p>So why do I care?&nbsp;</p><p>Well, if I do nothing about DEI I am concerned about the next time someone I care deeply for gets hurt by another EA making a \u201cDEI mistake\u201d. What should I tell my loved one if that happens? \u201cSorry, but I think that\u2019s ok, they probably didn\u2019t mean to hurt you\u201d? I can promise you that won\u2019t fly, and nor should it. It is only fair to expect better. Much better. Afterall, my friends do not have to put up with that type of shit where they usually hang out.<br><br>Also, when I have brought up the issue of whiteness in EA with my PoC friends, they almost always ask the same question: \"Why don't you do something about that, Ulrik?\" it feels really weird to say \"I can't\", especially when there are tons of way to improve things. \"If not me, then who? If not now, then when?\" etc.</p><p>At least I can do this: I can work as much as I can to improve the abysmal (abysmal compared to the lofty ambitions of saving black kids from Malaria, the world from AI &nbsp;and of being super altruistic and super rational/un-biased) state of DEI in EA. And the next time an EA hurts someone I care for, I can at least say \u201clisten, this movement has lots of issues and it has people who act in hurtful ways. But the movement also has amazing people, and we are working together to do something I care deeply about. And I am trying as hard as I can to make people in the movement act in less hurtful ways.\u201d That&nbsp;<i>might&nbsp;</i>fly.</p><p>Don\u2019t get me wrong - it is not like the people I care for are some delicate flowers, nor is it like I think the perpetrators of these hurtful behaviors are are sadistic, white EA men. I like to believe the state of affairs is simply down to lack of awareness and exposure. Why else would the cosmopolitan circles I am used to hanging out in not have the same issues EA do? I have seen better. I know things can be better.</p><p>You see, I can only belong somewhere all my friends and family can belong too. Right now I do not feel like I belong in EA, and that is coming from a white het cis and able bodied man! But I am hell bent on doing all I can to make it so that I feel like I belong because EA is the closest thing to a \u201ccommunity home\u201d I have ever known. If I step on some white, male toes towards that goal I unapologetically apologize - my choice is to either stay the course on my DEI crusade or be \u201ckicked out\u201d. Kick all you want, just please don\u2019t kick the people I love.</p><p>This post:</p><ul><li>Only intends to describe why I care. It therefore does not:<ul><li>Offer solutions</li><li>Address potential counter arguments - you cannot really argue about how I feel</li><li>Is emotional in tone, because it describes my emotions</li><li>Does not contain data or analysis on DEI in EA - I feel what I feel due to the information contained in the post above.

That said, if marginalized groups would lead the work on DEI in EA, I would highly recommend that they are properly compensated for such work. Too often the burden of such work lands on marginalized groups, often even unpaid.</li></ul>", "user": {"username": "Ulrik Horn"}}, {"_id": "tX2MqRfZtz7TqYCQi", "title": "New video: You're richer than you realise", "postedAt": "2024-03-13T00:14:14.403Z", "htmlBody": "<p>This might be one of the best pieces of introductory content to the concepts of effective giving that GWWC has produced in recent years!</p><p>I hit the streets of London to engage with everyday people about their views on charity, giving back, and where they thought they stood on the global income scale.</p><p>This video was made to engage people with some of the core concepts of income inequality and charity effectiveness in the hope of getting more people interested in giving effectively.</p><p>If you enjoy it - I'd really appreciate a like, comment or share on YouTube to help us reach more people!</p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ekIRVhbpiQw\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ekIRVhbpiQw\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><p>There's a <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/en/discover-how-rich-you-really-are\">blog post and transcript of the video</a> available too.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Big thanks to Suzy Sheperd for directing and editing this project and to Julian Jamison and Habiba Banu for being interviewed!</p>", "user": {"username": "GraceAdams"}}, {"_id": "it8MZKuF8fDYLFJSh", "title": "The RCT Agenda - Bryan Caplan", "postedAt": "2024-03-13T05:57:54.968Z", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>Still, the fundamental reason why randomistas make so little headway on \u201cmarkets versus government\u201d is that they quietly reject the question!&nbsp; Instead of weighing markets versus government, they almost invariably weigh government versus government.&nbsp; As a result, government can never really lose.&nbsp;</p><p>To see what I mean, suppose an RCT tests whether smaller class sizes increase adult earnings.&nbsp; If researchers discover a sizable positive effect, the heralded \u201cpolicy implication\u201d will be: Spend more taxpayer money to reduce class sizes.&nbsp; If researchers find a small or negative effect, however, the policy implication is never: Cut school budgets and refund the savings to taxpayers.&nbsp; Instead, the lesson the researchers will draw is: We desperately need experiments on <i>other</i> ways schools might increase adult earnings.&nbsp; Maybe we should do an experiment with more school lunches.&nbsp; Maybe we should randomly raise teachers\u2019 pay.&nbsp; Or perhaps do an RCT on afterschool programs.&nbsp; No matter how many experiments fail, the Executive Summary will never read, \u201cLet\u2019s defund public education.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Is it true that market solutions aren't given enough consideration by randomistas?</p>", "user": {"username": "StablePanda"}}, {"_id": "nChw2Cnbu6mFMQKjw", "title": "Local maximums & bounded effectiveness in EA", "postedAt": "2024-03-12T17:00:09.021Z", "htmlBody": "<figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#ddeee8;border:1pt solid #97c9b1;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>This is a&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/draft-amnesty-week-2024\"><strong><u>Draft Amnesty Week</u></strong></a><strong> draft.</strong> It may not be polished, up to my usual standards, fully thought through, or fully fact-checked.&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:#eef8f4;border:1pt solid #97c9b1;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>Commenting and feedback guidelines:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>Keep one and delete the rest (or write your own):</p><ol><li>I'm posting this to get it out there.

There aren't any strong endorsements here, but rather explorations of a topic.</i></p><p>I occasionally wonder if we who care about EA are sometimes a bit too strict about applying principles. I mean that in the sense of cause neutrality and applying EA ideas/principles to areas that generally do not meet the bar for being EA. For example, I am guessing that a variety of interventions in low-income countries will be more cost effective (more bang for buck) than analogous interventions in the city of Cincinnati.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"inx08ci55d\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefinx08ci55d\"><sup><a href=\"#fninx08ci55d\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;But if an organization has a mission that is limited to a helping people in Cincinnati, then they should probably find the most effective <i>local maximum</i>?&nbsp;</p><p>I'm thinking of this as something like <i>bounded effectiveness</i>: it isn't cost competitive at a level of 10 times direct cash transfers, but <strong>within the boundaries that exist in this context</strong>, we want to be as effective as we can.</p><p>If John Doe runs a charity in Cincinnati and the donors want to keep the money local, he probably can't really do the \"typical\" EA stuff.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"2\" data-footnote-id=\"v8zedkjyibs\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefv8zedkjyibs\"><sup><a href=\"#fnv8zedkjyibs\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;But he could certainly find the most cost-effective options within the restrictions.

Below, you can read a few excerpts from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://probablygood.org/career-profiles/communications/\"><u>full profile</u></a>.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>Work in communications can play a critical role in an organization\u2019s success \u2013 if it\u2019s done well. Through activities like growing brand awareness, raising funds, attracting customers, and persuading decision-makers, communications professionals can amplify the work done by the rest of the organization.</p><p>Because of this, a career in communications can be a highly promising path for some people. However, because communications roles serve primarily to draw attention to and assist the work of others, it\u2019s crucial that people who want to have a positive impact seek out organizations that are doing high-quality work addressing important problems.</p><p>[...]</p><p>This career path comprises a diverse range of tasks and responsibilities, though they\u2019re all united by one key goal: sharing the right information with the right people in the right way. Within this broad goal, specific types of communications work include:</p><ul><li>Public relations: Public relations involves drafting public statements and press releases for an organization, potentially announcing new projects and updates, or even responding to controversy (known as crisis communications).&nbsp;</li><li>Marketing: Marketing also often falls under the remit of communications. Depending on the organization you\u2019re in, this could mean designing and implementing advertising campaigns, running publicity events, fundraising, writing newsletters, and more.</li><li>Active outreach: Communications professionals may also spend time reaching out and developing relationships with individuals outside the organization. This could include soliciting potential donors, raising awareness among important decision-makers, and more.</li><li>Internal communications: Especially at larger organizations, communications specialists can take on internal-facing communications tasks. These can include providing organization-wide updates, monitoring and improving internal communications processes, and developing materials such as newsletters and handbooks for staff.&nbsp;</li><li>Personal communications: This type of communications work involves working on behalf of a (typically influential) individual to maintain their public presence. It can involve creating social media posts, public statements, or even helping prepare for interviews and panel discussions.</li></ul><p>[...]</p><h2>How promising is communications?</h2><p>Working in communications can have a positive impact in at least a couple of different ways.</p><p>First, communications work can be a necessary part of the causal chain that transforms good work into having a real impact on the world. Here are a few examples:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Change public behavior</strong></p><p>Informing and motivating the wider public to change their behaviors can help drive positive change across many important problems such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://probablygood.org/cause-areas/climate-change/overview/\"><u>climate change</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://probablygood.org/cause-areas/animal-welfare/\"><u>animal welfare</u></a>, and public health. For instance,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://successfulsocieties.princeton.edu/publications/starting-ahead-staying-ahead-senegal%E2%80%99s-rapid-response-covid-19-2019-2020\"><u>the Senegalese government was lauded for its response to COVID-19</u></a>, keeping infections and deaths to comparatively low levels. A large part of this success&nbsp;<a href=\"https://successfulsocieties.princeton.edu/sites/g/files/toruqf5601/files/Senegal%20COVID_FINAL_UNDP%20Logo%20.pdf#page=14\"><u>has been attributed to its communications team</u></a>, which deployed early and effective messaging to raise awareness and promote effective behavior changes to mitigate the spread of the disease.</p><p><strong>Persuade relevant decision-makers</strong></p><p>Good communications can lead decision-makers to take important actions, such as developing legislation or changing corporate practices. There are many examples of this many of the important policy changes we see are often the result of people and organizations working behind the scenes to make change happen. Unfortunately, oftentimes this means that policy changes are made to favor only specific private interests, but the same mechanisms can also be used to push forward socially beneficial decisions at a large scale. For instance, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.catf.us/\"><u>Clean Air Task Force</u></a>, a climate advocacy organization,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.founderspledge.com/research/clean-air-task-force\"><u>has had impressive success</u></a> in convincing policymakers to implement substantial positive changes to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://probablygood.org/cause-areas/climate-change/careers/#Civil_servant\"><u>climate policy</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Drive public pressure and leverage it for change</strong></p><p>Raising awareness for important issues can help sway decision-makers who are sensitive to public opinion. One organization that has been highly successful in this is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thehumaneleague.org/\"><u>The Humane League</u></a>. The organization has been able to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/the-humane-league-corporate-cage-free-campaigns/\"><u>persuade numerous large companies to commit to exclusively stock cage-free eggs</u></a> (which significantly&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thehumaneleague.org/article/cage-free\"><u>reduces the suffering of hens</u></a>) through a mixture of online advertising, grassroots advocacy, and private engagement with companies.</p><p><strong>Improve communications within the organization</strong></p><p>By smoothing out internal communications, you could help an organization collaborate and coordinate more effectively. Improving internal systems can bring large benefits to any organizations, which we know thanks to research in other contexts. For instance, a report by McKinsey found that making full use of \u201csocial technologies\u201d within an organization&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/the-social-economy\"><u>can generate substantial productivity gains</u></a> within an organization.&nbsp;</p><p>Though there are multiple routes through which communications professionals can provide value, it can also be helpful to more generally think of communications professionals as&nbsp;<i>multipliers&nbsp;</i>of an organization\u2019s impact. Working in communications usually means you won\u2019t be involved directly with creating products or delivering services. Instead, you\u2019ll often work to amplify your organization\u2019s work, ensuring it reaches the right people and resonates with them. Though it\u2019s hard to quantify, there\u2019s reason to think that this multiplier can be significant. Because of this, our impression is that for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://probablygood.org/career-profiles/communications/#How_to_test_personal_fit\"><u>people who are a great fit</u></a>, communications careers can be highly promising.&nbsp;</p><p>Naturally, because communications work is so closely tied to an organization,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://probablygood.org/career-guide/assessing-impact/\"><u>choosing the right organization and role&nbsp;</u></a>is perhaps even more important here than it is for other career paths. We discuss this more in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://probablygood.org/career-profiles/communications/#Priorities_within_communications\"><u>our section on priorities within communications careers</u></a>.</p><p>[...]</p><h1>Strategies and next steps</h1><h3>Getting into the field</h3><p>It\u2019s not always clear how to enter a new field. Though there are often many ways into any career path, here are some reliably helpful ways to get started in communications:</p><ul><li><strong>Undergraduate degrees</strong> \u2013 Communications roles generally require an undergraduate degree as a minimum. Typical subjects include journalism, marketing, English (or the relevant language in your context) and, of course, communications. Anything with a substantial writing component is likely to provide a good first step.</li><li><strong>Subject specialization \u2013&nbsp;</strong>Having said this, communications roles sometimes require subject-specific experience or education. For instance, a communications role in a climate-change nonprofit might require prior knowledge of climate science. So, if you\u2019re wanting to work in a specific&nbsp;<a href=\"https://probablygood.org/cause-overviews/\"><u>cause area</u></a>, it can be beneficial to develop subject expertise (for instance, through a relevant college degree) and develop your communications skills alongside this subject expertise, rather than the other way around.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Blogs or student publications&nbsp;</strong>\u2013 We mentioned starting a blog or joining a student publication as great ways to test personal fit, but they\u2019re also a helpful first step into the field. By building a portfolio of writing, you\u2019ll be able to demonstrate your abilities to potential employers. Writing samples are often part of the application process for communications roles.</li><li><strong>Other work experience</strong> \u2013 In addition to a catalog of writing experience, being able to demonstrate other skills such as video editing, event planning, and marketing (among others) is highly advantageous for relevant communications roles. Professional experience in these skills is not required, but independent projects are also a great way to demonstrate your capabilities.</li></ul><h3>Excelling in the field</h3><p>There are several techniques that can help you be a better communications professional:</p><ul><li><strong>Learn to wear many hats</strong> \u2013 Especially in smaller organizations, becoming skilled at many internal and external communications responsibilities will help you stand out from the rest. But even at larger organizations, understanding the various components of communications work can help you get a better view of the overall picture.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Identify the most important people to reach</strong> \u2013 Great communication work can be wasted if it\u2019s not directed at the people who can activate change. Working out who to reach is therefore key for amplifying your organization\u2019s positive impact. The concept of \u2018<a href=\"https://effectivethesis.org/research-advice/creating-a-theory-of-change/\"><u>back-chaining</u></a>\u2019 could be helpful in this. This is where you identify how positive change will ultimately happen, and work backwards step by step to identify the people you need to reach, and the message you need to send, in order to reach it.</li><li><strong>Use the right message and medium&nbsp;</strong>\u2013 Once you\u2019ve identified the most promising target audience, it\u2019s vital to reach them in ways they\u2019re receptive to. For instance, if you want to raise awareness of an issue among a young audience, then you might want to produce engaging short-form video content. But if you intend to influence policymakers, then you may opt to take a more formal tone in branding and messaging, as well as communicating via venues that lend you credibility.</li><li><strong>Stay up to date with new media channels&nbsp;</strong>\u2013 The way people consume media often changes, and this means the best ways of reaching people (especially across different target audiences) will change, too. Try to keep up with new platforms and content formats, as this will help you know how best to reach the people you need to.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Be honest</strong> \u2013 For most organizations (including nonprofits), there are incentives to make misleading or even false claims in order to appeal to customers and donors or manage their reputation. It\u2019s important to resist these incentives. To have a real impact, it\u2019s crucial to be transparent about your organization\u2019s failures as well as successes, even if this comes at a cost.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Use best practices for measurement and evaluation \u2013&nbsp;</strong>It\u2019s hard to measure exactly how much value communications work adds to an organization, especially&nbsp;<a href=\"https://probablygood.org/core-concepts/counterfactual-impact/\"><u>counterfactually</u></a>. However, through identifying useful proxies and indicators, you can get some sense of how much value your work is adding. For instance,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://amecinternationalsummitstockholm.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/UNICEF-Global-Communication-and-Public-Advocacy-Strategy1.pdf\"><u>UNICEF\u2019s communications strategy</u></a> identified numerous metrics and indicators to assess their success, such as the share of attention they received on relevant news and media items, and the proportion of the public who understand UNICEF\u2019s central mission.</li></ul><p>You can read the full profile over at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://probablygood.org/career-profiles/communications/\"><u>Probably Good</u></a>.</p><p>Is there any content that you\u2019d like to see from Probably Good?

Back of the envelope maths says something like $10 per person-year of stored food, or around 0.05% ($3B) of US GDP to ensure a year of food for every person in the US.</p><p>This would be beneficial across a wide range of catastrophe scenarios, and could be a complement to or a replacement for the idea of <a href=\"https://allfed.info/resilient-foods\">resilient foods</a> (like turning wood into digestible carbs). In the event of a disaster, it might take a long time (months/years) for resilient foods to be scaled up to a sufficient level, meaning a large stockpile would still be valuable.</p><p>Additionally many sorts of food-reducing disasters may not last more than a few months or years anyway (especially when adjusted for the fact that it could be more like a reduction in crop yields rather than a total lack of food), in which case this could be a sufficient solution and not just a complimentary one.</p><p>Nuclear winter particularly is generally predicted to result in at most years (not decades) of reduced (but not eliminated) crop yields, and so storing a few years worth of food could be a sufficient and in fact more robust solution than the large amount of research/coordination required to scale up resilient foods. That said I'm pretty sceptical of nuclear winter<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"4dow73pit8x\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4dow73pit8x\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4dow73pit8x\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;anyway, but there are other sorts of catastrophes (great power conflict, widespread crop blight) where it certainly wouldn't hurt the situation to have several years of food for everyone on the planet stored somewhere.</p><p>Given that the $10 per person-year is likely optimistic, I would guess that this is a quite good but not fantastically &nbsp;great intervention in marginal cost effectiveness terms. E.g. LEEP is ~$14 per DALY, and this would be ~$10 per ~40 DALYs if a year of food is enough to tide someone through a disaster in which they otherwise would have starved. But this is obviously only realised if such a disaster occurs.</p><p>I think it could be something like <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/LmtD3JKGJt4HHijyz/pepfar-and-the-costs-of-cost-benefit-analysis\">PEPFAR</a> though where it's very simple and scalable so you could convince governments to adopt it and bear most of the cost. Also you might imagine that it reduces the risk of civilisational collapse or extinction more than the marginal $/DALY number implies.</p><p><strong>The back of the envelope maths</strong></p><p>I'm assuming you would store some food that is cheap + calorie dense + has a long storage life in big, government-operated, centralised locations to keep the storage costs down.</p><p>Taking palm oil as an example of a high calorie/$ food, and assuming that you can extend the shelf life by freezing it/putting it in an inert environment/not worrying about the rancid taste because you would otherwise starve to death, we get:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.mpevans.co.uk/palm-oil/palm-oil-nutrition/composition-of-palm-oil\">9000 kcal/kg</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/675813/average-prices-palm-oil-worldwide/\">$1/kg</a></li><li>Shelf life: <a href=\"https://www.cuttothetrace.com/2017/03/oil-shelf-life/\">1 year</a>, I'm going to assume you could extend that to 20 years by preserving it. I don't really see how it could go off in a low oxygen environment but maybe there's something I don't understand about how food goes off</li></ul><p>Assume a person needs 1800 kcal/day to stay alive (likely pessimistic), so 660,000 kcal/year. It would cost $73 to buy that much palm oil, $3.7/year if you stored it for 20 years. This doesn't account for storage costs and financing, hence the $10 per person-year estimate above.</p><p>If this was operated at country-scale this would also drive up food prices, I don't expect this to make too much difference though because if you are storing it for 20 years then you would only need 5% more calories produced, assuming you destroy it at the end of the 20 years. Also it might make sense to do something other than storing food until it's completely unusable.</p><ol class=\"footnote-section footnotes\" data-footnote-section=\"\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"4dow73pit8x\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn4dow73pit8x\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\" data-footnote-back-link=\"\" data-footnote-id=\"4dow73pit8x\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref4dow73pit8x\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\" data-footnote-content=\"\"><p>For basically the reasons outlined in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Ysq53coRwgSWHHz2x/nuclear-winter-scepticism\">these</a> <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gktZ8zuzyh7HEgjfc/famine-deaths-due-to-the-climatic-effects-of-nuclear-war\">posts</a></p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "Will Howard"}}, {"_id": "WRnT9hGfg3oKfKtXa", "title": "AI governance and strategy: a list of research agendas and work that could be done.", "postedAt": "2024-03-12T11:21:44.359Z", "htmlBody": "<h2>AI governance and strategy: a list of research agendas and work that could be done</h2><p>This document was written by Nathan Barnard and Erin Robertson.</p><p>We have compiled a list of research agendas in AI governance, and we\u2019ve written some possible questions that people could work on.

Thus far there has been a lot of work looking at case studies of particular regulatory regimes, and work looking deeply into the mechanics of US government and how this could matter for AI regulation.</p><h3>Questions</h3><ul><li>Systematic statistical work estimating the effects of regulatory and quasi-regulatory interventions:</li><li><a href=\"https://cset.georgetown.edu/publication/repurposing-the-wheel/\">This</a>&nbsp;paper looks at case studies of non-legally-binding standards from other industries but makes no attempt at statistically estimating the effect of non-legally binding standards on accident rates - this could be very useful.</li><li>There have been many individual case studies on different regulatory regimes, but to my knowledge no statistical work trying to estimate the average effect size of, for instance US federal regulation, or the creation of a new regulatory agency on accident rates.</li><li>It looks likely that the default way in which the US regulates AI is with <a href=\"https://www.ibm.com/topics/nist\">NIST&nbsp;standards</a>. It\u2019s unclear how useful these standards are likely to be and statistical work estimating the average reduction in accident rates from NIST standards would shed light on this question.</li></ul><p>There are of course reasons why this statistical work hasn\u2019t been done - it\u2019s hard to get good data on these questions, and it\u2019ll be difficult to credibly estimate the causal effect of these interventions because it\u2019s hard to do <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_experiment\">natural experiments</a>. Nevertheless, we think it\u2019s worth some people trying hard to make progress on these questions - without this kind of statistical work we should be extremely uncertain about how useful standards that don\u2019t have the force of law will be in particular.</p><p><strong>UK specific questions</strong></p><ul><li>Could the UK establish a new regulator for AI (similar to the Financial Conduct Authority or Environment Agency)? What structure should such an institution have? This question may be especially important because the UK civil service tends to hire generalists, in a way which could plausibly make UK AI policy substantially worse. &nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>US specific questions</strong></p><p>There are many, many questions on the specifics of US interventions and lots of work being done on them. In listing these questions I\u2019ll try to avoid duplication of work that\u2019s already been done or is in the process of being done.</p><ul><li>Can the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) be improved and is this tractable? Under the recent Biden EO, DHS took on an important role in AI regulation and we expect this to continue given the placement of WMD and cybersecurity in DHS. The DHS has also - since its creation - in 2001 been rated as one of the worst performing parts of the US government and it\u2019s very unclear if this is likely to change, how much it matters for AI, and whether these are tractable interventions to improve DHS.</li><li>What should we expect the risk tolerance of the civilian officials in the Department of Defence (DoD) to be in the case where the DoD plays a large role in AI development. My strong impression from the history of Nuclear weapons in the US is that uniformed officials are willing to take large risks in exchange for relatively small increases in the chance that the US would win a war, but it\u2019s not clear that this is the case for the civilians in the DoD.</li><li>Liability law is a tool used to try to internalise the costs of harm caused by firms and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/epKBmiyLpZWWFEYDb/tort-law-can-play-an-important-role-in-mitigating-ai-risk\">has been proposed</a>&nbsp;as a tool to try to reduce harms from AI. We haven\u2019t found good empirical work estimating the effect of changes in liability law on accident rates in industries plausibly similar to AI - such as oil - where there are large but rare accidents. We don\u2019t expect this work to be done by law professors, but do expect knowledge both of law and statistics and particularly causal inference.</li></ul><p><strong>EU specific questions</strong></p><p>We are not particularly plugged in to what's happening in the EU, so take these questions with a big pinch of salt. <a href=\"https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/ai-act-explorer/\">This</a>&nbsp;website has very useful summaries of the various parts of the EU AI act.</p><ul><li>What opportunities for lobbying from tech firms will there be in the <a href=\"https://artificialintelligenceact.eu/standard-setting/\">EU standard setting process</a>? For instance, will they by default be consulted during the stakeholder engagement?</li><li>When are the key times for civil society bodies to engage with the EU standard setting process? Are there specific dates when AI safety orgs should have documents ready?</li><li>How far will the EU defer to international standards settings bodies on AI standards?</li><li>How will the <a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/policies/ai-office\">AI board</a>&nbsp;function and who is likely to be appointed to it? Are there other similar boards within the EU?</li><li>Which are the most important national standards bodies for EU standard setting?</li><li>Where is the EU AI act good and bad for reducing Xrisk?</li></ul><h2>Compute governance&nbsp;</h2><h3>Theory of change</h3><p>Much compute&nbsp;governance work hinges on the assumption that access to compute&nbsp;(often GPUs) is crucial for development of frontier AI systems. Policymakers may be able to influence the pace and direction of development by controlling or tracking these resources. A good example of this is US <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/18/tech/us-china-chip-export-curbs-intl-hnk/index.html\">export controls</a>&nbsp;on chips to China.</p><p>We expect that the role of chips may shift in the coming years, and they may be less clearly a bottleneck to development. It may be that the bottleneck shifts to algorithmic progress or financial constraints of firms. We expect that work imagining possible failure modes of compute governance, and possible alternative constraints on progress will be helpful, since work of this kind is neglected. It's worth noting that it's only recently that training costs from computation have reached the level to put training models out of reach for semi-large firms, but prior to this there were only a small number of leading labs. This implies that something other than compute is the main constraint on the ability of labs to produce frontier models, which <a href=\"https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/CSET-22The-Main-Resource-is-the-Human22.pdf\">this</a>&nbsp;paper lends some support to. This implies that it\u2019s plausible that theories of change that rely on controlling who has access to leading node AI chips might not be very effective.</p><h3>Past work</h3><p>Some examples of past work include;</p><ul><li>Putting \u201cswitch off\u201d capability into chips which can stop dangerous situations before they get out of hand, investigated <a href=\"https://www.iaps.ai/research/secure-governable-chips\">here</a>.</li><li>Tracking chips, so that state actors are able to better enforce standards, which they might impose on models above a specified number of floating point operations per second (FLOP/s), investigated <a href=\"https://www.governance.ai/research-paper/computing-power-and-the-governance-of-artificial-intelligence\">here</a>.</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://cdn.governance.ai/Computing_Power_and_the_Governance_of_AI.pdf\">This</a>&nbsp;recent paper on compute&nbsp;governance has an appendix with broad research directions at the end, and we encourage interested readers to draw from it for research ideas focused on advancing the compute&nbsp;governance agenda. &nbsp;</p><h3>Questions</h3><p>These questions are quite idiosyncratic and focused on examining the failure modes of compute&nbsp;governance.</p><ul><li>How feasible would it be for China to implement export controls for chips to the US.</li><li>Currently the US has imposed aggressive export controls, in collaboration with the Netherlands and Japan (both very important countries in the semiconductor supply chain) on both advanced node chips&nbsp;and inputs needed to make advanced node chips in China. China has control of a large share of the supply chain of some of the raw materials needed for chip production. It\u2019s currently unclear how feasible it would be for China to impose extremely aggressive export controls on these raw materials, and the degree to which this could be used by China to negotiate for less strict export controls by the US and allies.</li><li>What is the likely impact of the US export controls of chips to China? See if it\u2019s possible to work out how Chinese companies reacted to the controls, and if the implementation has affected progress.</li><li>Explore possible other bottlenecks to development of frontier models, possibly focussing on projected financial constraints, or projected algorithmic constraints, or data. Make some systematic survey- one useful method for this would be to quickly get some answers from experts on relevant questions, and see where people\u2019s intuitions are.</li><li>Algorithmic efficiency. It may be possible to map relevant algorithmic gains over the past few years, and may be possible to make projections or observations from this data.</li><li>Supply chain: Map the supply chain for chips, using trade data, industry reports, and academic literature. Attempt to assess the strategic impact of this info.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Corporate governance</h2><p>Corporate governance refers to the policies, procedures, and structures by which an organisation is controlled, aiming to align the organisation's objectives with various stakeholders including shareholders, employees, and society.</p><p>Corporate governance allows individuals and leadership within a company to be held accountable for their decisions and the effects they have.</p><h3>Theory of change</h3><p>There are a few reasons why corporate governance can be a valuable alongside good regulation:</p><ul><li>Frontier AI organisations have a greater understanding of their own operations and more resources than regulators.</li><li>Senior leadership of firms have limited information on everything that goes on in the firm. Therefore, strong communication channels and systems of oversight are needed to effectively manage risks.</li><li>The good intentions of individuals in a company don\u2019t reliably mean good outcomes of the organisation as a whole. So there is a need for well designed processes to allow those good intentions to be acted on.</li></ul><h3>Past work</h3><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7vcEq6nGojvhSTKo2/corporate-governance-for-frontier-ai-labs-a-research-agenda\">This</a>&nbsp;research agenda from Matt Wearden is a great place to look for questions. The questions we mention here are focussed on trying to understand the track record of corporate governance.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.governance.ai/research-paper/how-to-design-an-ai-ethics-board\">This</a>&nbsp;paper from Schuett et al looks at the design of AI ethics boards. There are lots of detailed questions of design of ethics boards - financing, legal structure ect - they seem important. I\u2019d be interested though in case studies of cases where ethics boards have plausibly counterfactually prevented harm</li><li>Are there cases where it\u2019s plausible that shareholders would sue AI firms that attempted to make safety enhancing decisions at the expense of profitability, or where there the threat of suit or even generic sense of responsibility to shareholders would meaningfully change the decisions that firms make around safety?</li></ul><p><a href=\"https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/1adf000c8f675958c2ee23805d91aaade1cd4613/responsible-scaling-policy.pdf\">Responsible scaling policies</a>&nbsp;(RSPs) are probably the most important corporate governance and risk management tool being used at AI labs. Responsible scaling policies are the practices that firms commit to undertake to ensure that they can appropriately manage the risks associated with larger models.</p><p>I (Nathan) personally think that RSPs are useful for three reasons:</p><ul><li>A way for firms to prepare for the risks from scaling up models</li><li>Act as a way of reconciling the views of people with diverse views on AI safety where RSPs represent an agreement between factions to take costly, safety enhancing actions conditional of models displaying some dangerous capabilities</li><li>They are a way of firms tying their own hands so that they take costly actions to prevent risks from models (this is the most speculative of the three reasons)</li></ul><p>Some questions that might be important around RSPs are:</p><ul><li>How good is the theory of change for RSPs for preventing risks from <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.13353\">misaligned power-seeking</a>&nbsp;</li><li>What does a <a href=\"https://www.fortinet.com/uk/resources/cyberglossary/defense-in-depth#:~:text=Defense%20in%20depth%20is%20a,are%20stopped%20along%20the%20way.\">defence-in-depth</a>&nbsp;way of doing RSPs</li><li>Do RSPs help with coordination between firms</li><li>How likely is it that RSPs become the basis for law</li></ul><p>Industry led standards bodies are common across sectors, for instance <a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sro.asp\">finance</a>&nbsp;has quite a lot of these self-regulatory bodies (SRB). We aren\u2019t sure if these are effective at actually leading to lower accident rates in the relevant industries, and if so what the effect size, particularly in comparison to regulation. It could be really useful for someone to do a case study on a plausible case in which SRB reduced accidents in an industry and what the mechanism for this was.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>International governance</h2><h3>Theory of change</h3><p>It seems like there are two worlds where international governance is important.</p><ol><li>Firms are able to go to jurisdictions with laxer AI regulation, leading to a race to the bottom between jurisdictions.</li><li>States become interested in developing powerful AI systems (along the lines of space race) and this leads to dangerous racing.</li></ol><p>In both of these cases international agreements could improve coordination between jurisdictions and states to prevent competition that\u2019s harmful to AI safety.</p><h3>Past work</h3><p>Most of the academic work on international governance has been aimed at the first theory of change.</p><p><a href=\"https://cdn.governance.ai/International_Governance_of_Civilian_AI_OMS.pdf\">Trager et al</a>&nbsp;propose an international governance regime for civilian AI with a similar structure to international agreements around the verification of the rules of jurisdictions, similar to international agreements on aeroplane safety. <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.04123.pdf\">Baker</a>&nbsp;looks at nuclear arms control verification agreements as a model for an AI treaty. There has also been some excitement about CERN for AI, as <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/PJxkdzTTYDyrRT99M/ai-relevant-regulation-cern\">this</a>&nbsp;EA forum post explains, but little more formal work investigating the idea.</p><p>There has also been some work on racing between states, for instance <a href=\"https://cdn.governance.ai/International_Races_for_Risky_Technologies_DRAFT_NOV_2022.pdf\">this</a>&nbsp;paper from Stafford et al.</p><h3>Questions</h3><p>Nathan is sceptical that international agreements on AI will matter very much and most of the questions are about investigating whether international agreements could solve important problems and could feasibly be strong enough to solve these important problems. &nbsp;</p><ul><li>What are the distinguishing features of the Montreal Protocol on CFCs that made it so effective?</li><li>Similarly, why has the nuclear non-proliferation treaty been effective? In the sense that there hasn\u2019t been much nuclear proliferation. What was the counterfactual of the treaty over merely the US and USSR extending their nuclear umbrellas to a large fraction of states that could plausibly get nuclear weapons? It seems like the treaty itself hasn\u2019t mattered very much since states which have wanted nuclear weapons - like Pakistan, India and Israel - have just not ratified the treaty.</li><li>How effective has the Paris Climate accord been, in the light of a lack of enforcement provisions?</li><li>How effective have the Basel agreements on international finance been? Are there ways to make the application of treaties quicker given the length of time it took to both agree to and put into practice the various agreements from the Basel agreements?</li><li>What circumstances do we see regulatory arbitrage causing a race to the bottom? <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EehuKzAvEbDbXxTwJ/what-we-can-learn-from-stress-testing-for-ai-regulation\">Nathan\u2019s own research</a>&nbsp;suggests that we don\u2019t see this when central banks engage in stress testing, but it\u2019s commonly believed that we have seen this in the ways in which firms set corporate tax rates. What determines this and what should we expect to see with AI? &nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Misuse&nbsp;</h2><p>Nathan isn\u2019t convinced there should be much focus on misuse risks from communities worried about existential risks from AI for two reasons:</p><ul><li>National security establishments seem to have woken up to the risk of misuse from AI, particularly on the bio and cybersecurity side, and he expects them to be able to handle these risks effectively</li><li>He is more generally sceptical of the x-risk case from misuse.</li></ul><p>We would be particularly interested in empirical work that tries to clarify how likely x-risk from misuse is. Some work in this vein that is extremely useful is<a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/635693acf15a3e2a14a56a4a/t/64f0a7838ccbf43b6b5ee40c/1693493128111/XPT.pdf\">&nbsp;this</a>&nbsp;report from the forecasting research institute on how likely superforecasters think various forms of x-risk are, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/M6zAzCBAsBxem7Lu4/can-a-terrorist-attack-cause-human-extinction-not-on-priors\">this</a>&nbsp;EA forum post that looks at the base rates of terrorist attacks, and <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2977-2.html\">this</a>&nbsp;report from RAND on how useful LLMs are for bioweapon production.</p><p>Some theoretical work that has really influenced Nathan\u2019s thinking here is <a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/Leopold-Aschenbrenner_Existential-risk-and-growth_.pdf\">this</a>&nbsp;paper from Aschenbrenner modelling how x-risk changes with economic growth. The core insight of the paper is that, even if economic growth initially increases x-risk due to new technologies, as societies get richer they get more willing to spend money on safety enhancing technologies, which can be used to force down x-risk.</p><h3>Questions</h3><p>Some empirical work that we think would be helpful here:</p><ul><li>Changes in rates of terrorist attacks with changes in availability of the internet and quality of google search.</li><li>A high quality literature review on how rates of terrorist attacks and fatalities change with GDP - are richer countries able to spend money to reduce the risks of terrorist attacks?</li><li>The most commonly cited example of a homicidal terrorist group is <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aum_Shinrikyo\">Aum Shinrikyo</a>. However I\u2019ve also heard reports that instead of killing everyone, they wanted to start a war between Japan and the US which would have a lot of casualties although Japan would rise from the ashes of war.<br>This might explain why, to my knowledge, they only attempted attacks with sarin and anthrax, neither of which are infectious diseases.&nbsp;<br>If there are in fact no examples of homicidal terrorist groups, this would be a big update on the risks from AI misuse. David Thorstad has a <a href=\"https://ineffectivealtruismblog.com/2023/05/19/epistemics-part-2-examples/\">good post</a>&nbsp;on this already, but we think more work would still be useful.</li><li>Trying to understand why terrorists don\u2019t seem to use cyberattacks very often.<br>The model of advances in AI capabilities leading to large harms from misuse predicts lots of terrorist attacks that use malware, but Nathan\u2019s understanding is that this isn\u2019t the case. It would be useful to know why, and what evidence this provides on the misuse question.</li></ul><h2>Evals</h2><h3>Theory of change</h3><p>Evals are a tool for assessing whether AI systems pose threats by trying to elicit potentially dangerous capabilities and misalignment from AI systems. This is a new field and there are many technical questions to tackle in it. The interested reader is encouraged to read <a href=\"https://www.apolloresearch.ai/blog/we-need-a-science-of-evals\">this</a>&nbsp;post on developing a science of evals from Apollo, a new organisation focused on evals.</p><p>The governance questions for evals are how evals fit into a broader governance strategy. See <a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/6593e7097565990e65c886fd/t/65a6f1389754fc06cb9a7a14/1705439547455/auditing_framework_web.pdf\">this</a>&nbsp;paper from Apollo and <a href=\"https://metr.org/\">this</a>&nbsp;introduction to METR\u2019s&nbsp;work. Evals also play a central part in the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/ai-regulation-a-pro-innovation-approach-policy-proposals/outcome/a-pro-innovation-approach-to-ai-regulation-government-response\">UK government's AI regulation strategy</a>. See box 5 of the UK government's recent white paper for questions the UK government has, many of which relate to evals.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Questions</h3><p>Some particular questions we are interested in are:</p><ul><li>How can we ensure that evals are not gamed, in a broadly similar way to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Volkswagen_emissions_scandal\">Volkswagen gas emissions tests</a>&nbsp;(I think this would make a great case study,) or the risk ratings given by <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EehuKzAvEbDbXxTwJ/what-we-can-learn-from-stress-testing-for-ai-regulation\">credit ratings agencies prior to the financial crisis</a>?</li><li>How should information from evals be made public? <a href=\"https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-economics-080218-025739\">Information design literature</a>&nbsp;could be informative here, e.g <a href=\"https://www.bundesbank.de/resource/blob/703714/6d5f6dbfb4b02518c268ce8cea01872f/mL/2012-12-04-dkp-32-data.pdf\">this</a>&nbsp;paper on the release of stress testing information</li><li>How important is having in-house government capacity for doing evals?

There seem to be two big ways in which China questions matter:</p><ol><li>How likely is it that a Chinese lab develops TAI that causes an existential catastrophe? Does this mean that we should be more reluctant to adopt measures that slow down AI in the US and allies?</li><li>How likely is there to be an AI arms race between the US and China?</li></ol><p>There are three sub questions to the first question that I\u2019m really interested in:</p><ol><li>How likely is it that a Chinese lab is able to develop TAI before a US lab?</li><li>What alignment measures are Chinese labs likely to adopt?</li><li>How long should we expect it to take Chinese labs to catch up to US labs once a US lab has developed TAI?</li></ol><p>Crucial context to here is the<a href=\"https://csis-website-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/s3fs-public/2024-02/240221_Shivakumar_Balancing_Ledger.pdf?VersionId=5juRJmop6MEsOnR.skVAafg5RGRDsVJz\">&nbsp;export controls</a>&nbsp;adopted by the Biden administration in 2022, and updated in 2023, which aim to maximise the distance between leading node production in the US and allies and leading node production in China, combined with a more narrow aim of specifically restricting the technology that the Chinese military has access to.</p><h3>Past work</h3><p>There\u2019s lots of great work both on the <a href=\"https://www.trade.gov/country-commercial-guides/china-us-export-controls\">export controls</a>, <a href=\"https://cdn.governance.ai/Trends_in_Chinas_LLMs.pdf\">the Chinese AI sector</a>, and<a href=\"https://www.iaps.ai/research/ai-chip-making-china\">&nbsp;Chinese semiconductor manufacturing capabilities</a>.

It may also turn out that AI makes cyberattacks very easy to conduct technically, so the way to deter cyberattacks is with very aggressive reprisals against groups found to be conducting cyberattacks, combined with an international extradition treaty for cybercriminals.</p><h3>Past work</h3><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/working_papers/WRA2849-1.html\">RAND interim report on securing model weights</a>&nbsp;(the full ~130 page report is set to released soon)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/news/frontier-model-security\">Anthropic's post on Frontier Model Security</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/2oAxpRuadyjN2ERhe/information-security-considerations-for-ai-and-the-long-term\">Jeffrey Ladish and Lennart Heim's post on infosec and AI</a></li></ul><h3>Questions</h3><p>All of these questions will be social science questions rather than technical questions - this is not all meant to imply that technical infosec questions aren\u2019t important, just that we are completely unqualified to write interesting technical infosec questions.</p><ul><li>Are there any examples of firms taking fewer safety precautions out of fear that they could be hacked?</li><li>Are there examples of high value&nbsp;targets that we\u2019re confident haven\u2019t been hacked e.g US nuclear command and control? <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_smEDPWDVIaLuZ14Cm7KLHcWx4LkJ0DCTk8bcHjYy_Y/edit\">This</a>&nbsp;is a good list of high-stakes breaches (hasn\u2019t been updated since 2020, some more recent ones are listed <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_security_hacking_incidents\">here</a>. <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/nova-dassarma-information-security-and-ai-systems/\">This</a>&nbsp;podcast episode has some relevant information both for this question and for infosec for AI more generally</li><li>How effective are national security services at deterring cyberattacks?</li><li>Are there examples of security services aiding private firms in their cyber defence and how effective has that been?

This means that a core assumption of much of this work is that AI progress can be converted into a common currency of compute - the assumption here is that if you throw enough compute at today's data and algorithms you can get TAI.</p><p>Recently there\u2019s been quite a lot of focus on work on the economic and scientific impact of LLMs, for instance see <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/rfp-llm-impacts/\">this</a>&nbsp;post and <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/rfp-llm-benchmarks/\">this</a>&nbsp;post&nbsp;from Open Philanthropy calling for this kind of work.</p><h3>Questions</h3><ul><li>Actually trying to get to the bottom of why essentially all economists are so sceptical of explosive growth from AI.

Some people have defined this by \u201c<strong>AGI</strong>\u201d: an AI that can do everything a human can do but better. Some have defined it in terms of \u201c<strong>TAI</strong>\u201d: AI which significantly changes the economic growth rate such that global GDP grows X% each year, or so that scientific developments occur X% quicker. These changes may be abrupt, and may completely change the world in ways we can\u2019t predict. Some work has been done to anticipate these changes, and to avert the worst outcomes. It's becoming increasingly possible to do useful work under this theme, as some specific avenues for productive work have emerged. The hope is that anticipating the changes and the worst outcomes will help us have the appropriate mechanisms in place when things start getting weird.</p><h3>Past work</h3><p><a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/papers/digital-minds.pdf\">This</a>&nbsp;paper by Shulman and Bostrom on issues with digital minds is excellent, and <a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/windfallclause/\">this</a>&nbsp;paper from O\u2019Keefe et al looks specifically at the question of mechanisms to share the windfall from TAI.</p><p>A big challenge when trying to work on these kinds of questions is finding projects that are well-scoped, empirical or based in something with a well established theory like law or economics, while still plausibly being useful.</p><h3>Questions</h3><p>In light of this, here are some post TAI governance questions that could fulfil these criteria:</p><ul><li>The two best resources for a list of questions in this area are <a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/transformative-ai-issues-not-just-misalignment-an-overview/\">this</a>&nbsp;post by Holden Karnofsky and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EPx8gjkibxiT3dW9M/non-alignment-project-ideas-for-making-transformative-ai-go\">this</a>&nbsp;post by Lukas Finnveden.</li><li>Digital minds: How might legal protections evolve for digital beings?

After outlining the welfare threats farmed shrimp may face in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/YAFQV\"><u>second report</u></a>, we now investigate the effect of these welfare threats on pre-slaughter mortality.</p><p>In the first report in the Shrimp Welfare Sequence,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/b8n3t\"><u>Waldhorn and Autric (2023)</u></a> found that the number of shrimp alive at any time is much greater than one would expect based on the number of shrimp slaughtered per year and the length of the production cycle alone. While it was not a focus of the report, they mention that pre-slaughter mortality accounts for the discrepancy. Additionally, during the research for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/YAFQV\"><u>second report</u></a> in the sequence, we learned that welfare threats, like diseases or poor water quality, could lead to high mortality (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s11356-022-20963-y\"><u>Dayalan et al., 2022</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0044-8486(01)00530-0\"><u>McGraw et al., 2001</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2012.03.013\"><u>Stentiford et al., 2012</u></a>).

Pre-slaughter mortality rates may also offer insights into which species and life stages advocacy efforts should focus on. Furthermore, since dead shrimp no longer experience negative conditions, estimates of the prevalence of negative experiences must consider how long shrimp live on farms.</p><p>In this report, we aim to quantitatively examine how high shrimp pre-slaughter mortality is, whether it is particularly high for some life stages or species, how high it is relative to other farmed taxa, and explore possible causes. We consult and consolidate information from multiple sources, including academic and gray literature and industry sources. We focus on the three most farmed species:&nbsp;<i>Penaeus vannamei</i>,&nbsp;<i>Penaeus monodon</i>, and&nbsp;<i>Macrobrachium rosenbergii&nbsp;</i>(see&nbsp;<u>Box 2</u> for an overview of these species).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"table\"><table style=\"background-color:#efefef\"><tbody><tr><th style=\"background-color:#efefef\"><h3>Box 2: Background on shrimp farming</h3><p><i>P. vannamei</i> and&nbsp;<i>P. monodon</i> are marine shrimp from the taxonomic family Penaeidae (suborder Dendrobranchiata).&nbsp;<i>M. rosenbergii</i> is a freshwater species from the family Palaemonidae (infraorder Caridea, suborder Pleocyemata).&nbsp;</p><p>Farmed shrimp have three broad life stages: larval, postlarval, and juvenile\u2013subadult.

Ongrowing farms are often characterized as extensive, semi-intensive, intensive, and super-intensive. These differ in a few main ways (for a more comprehensive overview, see Table 1 in our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/YAFQV\"><u>previous report</u></a>):</p><ul><li><strong>Ponds:&nbsp;</strong>Extensive and semi-intensive ponds are usually outdoors, earthen ponds with water taken from a local natural source, sometimes they treat water. Intensive and super-intensive farms have ponds, tanks, or raceways lined with plastic or concrete, possibly indoors, and use separate water treatment ponds.</li><li><strong>Water quality:&nbsp;</strong>More intensive farms have more tools to monitor and control water quality. Super-intensive and intensive farms aerate water frequently or continuously. Semi-intensive farms may use paddlewheel aerators when pond oxygen is low. Extensive farms do not control their water quality.</li><li><strong>Stocking density:&nbsp;</strong>The more intensive a farm is, the higher the stocking density. This ranges from around &lt;5\u201320 postlarvae/m<sup>2</sup> in extensive farms to 130\u2013&gt;300 postlarvae/m<sup>2</sup> in super-intensive farms.</li><li><strong>Feed:&nbsp;</strong>Super-intensive and intensive farms rely on artificial shrimp feed, while extensive farms do not use feed, but they may fertilize the ponds to increase naturally produced food. Semi-intensive farms use a mixture of these strategies.</li><li><strong>Yields:&nbsp;</strong>Super-intensive farms produce many more shrimp per meter squared than extensive farms and output two to three crops per year, while extensive farms produce only one.</li></ul></th></tr></tbody></table></figure><h1><br><strong>Estimating farmed shrimp pre-slaughter mortality</strong></h1><h2>Survival curves model</h2><p>As an initial attempt to assess pre-slaughter mortality in farmed shrimp, we looked at data estimated in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/21679\"><u>Guesstimate model</u></a>\u2014a Monte Carlo model\u2014presented in the first report of the Shrimp Welfare Sequence (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/b8n3t\"><u>Waldhorn &amp; Autric, 2023</u></a>). According to this model, approximately 930 billion shrimp (95% credible intervals: 630 billion\u20131.4 trillion) perish on farms annually, with roughly 440 billion shrimp (300\u2013620 billion) slaughtered annually. These figures indicate that approximately 53% of shrimp die before reaching slaughter age. Is this mortality evenly distributed across the shrimp life cycle or among different farmed shrimp species?</p><p>To answer this question, we built survival curves using the data from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.getguesstimate.com/models/21679\"><u>Guesstimate model</u></a>.

Perhaps this is not unique to shrimp farming and is typical of aquaculture? Understanding the causes of premature mortality is essential to alleviating the suffering associated with dying. However, this is a difficult feat\u2014farmers and researchers usually report mortality rates as an indicator of production efficiency and costs, rarely directly linking shrimp deaths to specific conditions. An alternative approach is comparing shrimp with other farmed species, especially other invertebrates or aquatic animals. If mortality rates on shrimp farms are high relative to other farmed taxa, it might indicate that some characteristic of shrimp or shrimp farming practices is the root of the issue.&nbsp;</p><p>We compared farmed shrimp mortality (taken from the survival curves model) with that of broiler chickens, aquatic vertebrates (carnivorous fish)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"3\" data-footnote-id=\"hkq81a8dxm\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhkq81a8dxm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhkq81a8dxm\">[3]</a></sup></span>, and other invertebrate groups, including insects and non-shrimp crustaceans<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"4\" data-footnote-id=\"mxjcagl5ms\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmxjcagl5ms\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmxjcagl5ms\">[4]</a></sup></span>.

We did not have the data available to examine the association between mortality and weight at hatching or growth rate, so these characteristics may explain some early deaths (see&nbsp;<u>Causes</u> section).</p><h2>Data and method limitations</h2><p>There are a few reasons to doubt the veracity of sources included in all of the above analyses. For detailed explanations, refer to the limitations sections in the respective chapters of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.github.io/shrimp_mortality/\"><u>Methods document</u></a>. First, the data did not cover all farmed populations, omitting broodstock (shrimp used as breeders) and those that die during transportation.&nbsp;</p><p>Second, many estimates are based on farmer surveys rather than direct measurements, which introduces issues such as recall bias and non-random sampling. We suspect mass mortalities from forced depopulation are omitted from pre-slaughter mortality estimates, especially if shrimp are still sold for human consumption. Such events happen when a serious disease is detected before mass mortality occurs (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/M45A-YZ47\"><u>this news report</u></a> from Scotland and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/L7W4-QHZ3\"><u>this one</u></a> from Australia)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"6\" data-footnote-id=\"0qbpbepwuojb\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0qbpbepwuojb\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0qbpbepwuojb\">[6]</a></sup></span>. We were unable to find much information about the prevalence of the practice, though it is likely to increase as incidences of disease increase.&nbsp;</p><p>Third, there was often no standardized measurement of mortality across sources\u2014for example, there were no standard procedures for whether ranges were standard errors, standard deviations, confidence intervals, or something else.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, we frequently had to rely on industry sources, as opposed to academic ones, which may be biased and may be based more on \u2018gut feeling\u2019 estimations rather than empirical insights.</p><h1><strong>Causes</strong></h1><p>To generate hypotheses about why death rates are at the level they are, we compared farmed and wild shrimp mortality at each life stage (given that they have made it to that life stage) and cumulatively (Figure 5). Wild shrimp have higher median mortality than farmed shrimp at all life stages, though most markedly in the larval and postlarval stages.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6Ku4KeCoRzoN4BiEd/eqfd3mrk4c1cnshusjfj\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6Ku4KeCoRzoN4BiEd/nfycsfcuyowc1fevreeh 140w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6Ku4KeCoRzoN4BiEd/yj5reu7ydhfps8g9tdoa 280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6Ku4KeCoRzoN4BiEd/ouqriwkbtgqhsmmtdo90 420w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6Ku4KeCoRzoN4BiEd/p0d8pl0fi4qaksq68hgr 560w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6Ku4KeCoRzoN4BiEd/eufvjmmsluvur2lb2phv 700w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6Ku4KeCoRzoN4BiEd/dayctxvicjkctiylet5q 840w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6Ku4KeCoRzoN4BiEd/fggimxn1cn4ltzf5lzbr 980w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6Ku4KeCoRzoN4BiEd/pl4hq1ftwuo4bfhijx4h 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6Ku4KeCoRzoN4BiEd/c0bk12aauelzcjlrubvb 1260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6Ku4KeCoRzoN4BiEd/bvg7titbsfryguvqczhf 1344w\"><br><i>Figure 5: Stage-specific and cumulative mortality rates for farmed and wild shrimp.

They grow rapidly, achieve sexual maturity in a matter of months, and spawn several hundred thousand eggs at a time. Most of the eggs that hatch will not make it to adulthood. Additionally, penaeid shrimp larvae are planktonic, meaning they cannot swim against ocean currents but are carried along by them (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-818040-2.00002-2\"><u>Prangnell et al., 2019, p. 19</u></a>). As a result, whether they make it to the correct postlarval environment (brackish water for penaeids) or avoid predation by plankton feeders is beyond their control. We would expect farmed shrimp to die less than their wild counterparts because farms offer (at least some) protection from threats like predation or harsh environments.&nbsp;</p><h2>Larval mortality</h2><p>Despite being protected from many threats they would experience in the wild, our data suggest all three species experience larval and postlarval mortality upwards of 15% on farms (Table 1). Wild shrimp are often not resilient to unfavorable environmental conditions that are common during the larval stage because they receive little parental investment. Because wild shrimp evolved to make tradeoffs between resilience and other traits, there may be a practically unavoidable level of mortality in&nbsp;<i>farmed</i> shrimp.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"7\" data-footnote-id=\"4h1t0k4e4bf\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4h1t0k4e4bf\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4h1t0k4e4bf\">[7]</a></sup></span></p><p>Because of this lower resilience to environmental conditions, in their assessment protocols for shrimp welfare,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ani13050807\"><u>Pedrazzani et al. (2023)</u></a> give narrower optimal ranges for water quality parameters for larvae and postlarvae than they do for juvenile and adult shrimp.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-20966-6_11\"><u>Bauer (2023, p. 636)</u></a> notes that high levels of organic matter in ponds \u201centangles swimming and feeding appendages of larvae with subsequent high mortality.\u201d Therefore, adverse environmental effects may be more prevalent for larvae and postlarvae because farmers may find it harder to maintain environmental conditions within restricted limits. Larval shrimp are frequently soft-shelled as they molt (shed their exoskeleton) around eleven times to reach the postlarval stage (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/ZPK5-NPXE\"><u>Kentucky State University, 2002, p. 4</u></a>). This may leave them more vulnerable to any environmental fluctuations or to aggression from conspecifics.</p><h2>Postlarval mortality</h2><p>In addition to sensitivity to environmental fluctuations, which persist through the postlarval stage, there are three threats that could explain high mortality. First, postlarval shrimp are often transported between hatcheries and farms to be stocked into ongrowing ponds (see the Handling and transportation section in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/YAFQV\"><u>previous report</u></a> for an overview). Many shrimp can die if they are not carefully acclimated to the pond conditions before stocking. Some farms use a nursery stage before moving them to ongrowing ponds so that shrimp are older and less sensitive to water quality by the time they are stocked into ongrowing ponds (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/QY5F-HXNQ\"><u>Persyn &amp; Aungst, 2006, p. 42</u></a>). Others conduct stress tests, exposing postlarvae to extreme environmental conditions to \u2018weed out\u2019 weaker shrimp.&nbsp;</p><p>Cannibalism could also explain some postlarval mortality, though the case here is likely stronger for&nbsp;<i>P. monodon</i> than other species (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/7T84-XFD5\"><u>Abdussamad &amp; Thampy, 1994</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/are.12550\"><u>da Costa et al., 2016</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/WEF3-YFU5\"><u>Jiang et al., 2021</u></a>). While we found no data on cannibalism amongst larval shrimp, it is reasonable to think it could also occur during this life stage due to high molt frequency, though possibly they are too small to eat other shrimp. Cannibalism appears to be more common in postlarvae than juvenile\u2013subadults, potentially because shrimp molt less frequently as they get older (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/7T84-XFD5\"><u>Abdussamad &amp; Thampy, 1994, p.74</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Some deaths in this life stage may result from acute hepatopancreatic necrosis disease (AHPND). This bacterial disease, sometimes known as early mortality syndrome, affects&nbsp;<i>P. vannamei</i> and&nbsp;<i>P. monodon</i>, causes sudden mass mortality of up to 100% of infected shrimp, and usually emerges within 10 to 35 days of stocking ponds with shrimp (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/2X3E-T9TF\"><u>World Organisation for Animal Health, 2023, Ch. 2.2.1, p. 2</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><h2>Juvenile\u2013subadult mortality</h2><p>Shrimp ongrowing farms are often characterized as extensive, semi-intensive, intensive, and super-intensive (see&nbsp;<u>Box 2</u>). One way to understand if farming conditions cause deaths is to compare mortality rates across different farm types. We did so by taking sources from our quantitative literature analysis that reported mortality for specific farm types (Figure 6, note that this figure likely includes both postlarvae and juvenile\u2013subadult mortality).</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6Ku4KeCoRzoN4BiEd/pcg3qfe10unglc9qnmku\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6Ku4KeCoRzoN4BiEd/r43tgkxd0gmozxtpsphh 140w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6Ku4KeCoRzoN4BiEd/hqf84jvjioldz07fl13l 280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6Ku4KeCoRzoN4BiEd/e5qotkxzc78lpmpnfntv 420w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6Ku4KeCoRzoN4BiEd/sctqwcdkcz3sbibzjhqv 560w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6Ku4KeCoRzoN4BiEd/wpwqfhcyigqi3tynydny 700w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6Ku4KeCoRzoN4BiEd/hj3vktzluw6kqs1af4rz 840w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6Ku4KeCoRzoN4BiEd/y0tpxealseuwymffgpoy 980w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6Ku4KeCoRzoN4BiEd/zrrnmszepw7sq5ohliaz 1120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6Ku4KeCoRzoN4BiEd/pgmljmj36xn4uyafsxqx 1260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/6Ku4KeCoRzoN4BiEd/uvd3hpkhjjuxo8hw6sw2 1344w\"><br><i>Figure 6: Mortality rates at different types of ongrowing farms reported by the literature.

This may intuitively make sense as extensive farms most closely match a shrimp\u2019s natural habitat, and wild shrimp mortality is high (Figure 5). We assume that excess mortality in extensive ponds is generally due to predation and weather fluctuations.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"8\" data-footnote-id=\"drvtukh84a7\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdrvtukh84a7\"><sup><a href=\"#fndrvtukh84a7\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>All types of shrimp farms face significant mortality due to diseases, some of which lead to mass mortality events, impacting global shrimp populations and production statistics (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/5TRK-MLBE\"><u>Shinn et al., 2018</u></a>). According to two experts interviewed for our previous report, diseases are the primary cause of pre-slaughter mortalities in shrimp aquaculture.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/KA9P-GV2M\"><u>Benchmark Insights (2019, p. 17)</u></a> states that disease results in an average loss of 40% of shrimp production. While farmers are likely motivated to prevent infections, shrimp lack an adaptive immune system, so immunization is not often possible. Thus, farmers rely on preventive measures such as robust biosecurity protocols and water quality monitoring, which can be challenging and expensive.&nbsp;</p><p>Although all farms contend with disease, the distal cause might systematically differ across production types. Less intensive farms typically have looser monitoring and control of water quality parameters. While extreme fluctuations may directly cause deaths, subtle changes can also have sublethal impacts (see the Water quality section of our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.17605/OSF.IO/YAFQV\"><u>previous report</u></a>). These lower-level effects stress shrimp physiologically so that they divert metabolic energy to homeostasis, which can make them less able to fend off diseases when pathogens are present (<a href=\"https://5mbooks.com/product/the-shrimp-book-ii\"><u>Clayton et al., 2022, p. 296</u></a>). Some pathogens also only become virulent when environmental conditions change and favor them, which may be more probable when water quality is not regularly audited (for example,&nbsp;<i>Enterocytozoon hepatopenaei</i>, a fungus, is more infectious at higher salinity;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s12917-021-02778-0\"><u>Aranguren et al., 2021</u></a>). Diseases may, therefore, contribute to a steady, low level of mortality during the ongrowing stage.&nbsp;</p><p>One might anticipate worse water quality issues on intensive farms because higher stocking densities cause greater dissolved oxygen demand and more feces and feed. Closer contact with conspecifics and stress from crowding may also increase infection risk. However, closer water quality monitoring on these farms likely explains their lower mortality rates.</p><h2>Other causes&nbsp;</h2><p>Artificial genetic selection could also contribute to mortality, particularly if shrimp are bred for growth at the expense of survival. Kona Bay, a broodstock supplier, reports that their broodstock&nbsp;<a href=\"https://perma.cc/XST6-WXW2\"><u>selected for survival</u></a> produces offspring with higher survival in ongrowing to harvest than those selected for fast growth (85\u201390% vs 70\u201380%). It is also possible for other traits that cause weaknesses to be accidentally co-selected in breeding programs.&nbsp;</p><p>Eyestalk ablation of broodstock could weaken offspring immunity (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.736033\"><u>Zacarias et al., 2021</u></a>). As the industry increasingly relies on domesticated broodstock and a female can produce several thousand offspring, these weaknesses are likely widespread.</p><h1><strong>Implications and conclusions</strong></h1><p>Death is a useful proxy for whether a shrimp has endured highly negative experiences. Not only is the process of dying likely agonizing, but the conditions that increase vulnerability to death may make daily life unpleasant. Exploring pre-slaughter mortality rates gives us a lower-bound estimate for these negative experiences and generates hypotheses about aquaculture practices and characteristics of shrimp themselves that cause them.&nbsp;</p><p>The sheer magnitude of pre-slaughter mortality, though, raises the question of whether reducing pre-slaughter mortality should be a goal of stakeholders who aim to improve shrimp welfare. Potential ways to reduce premature deaths include closely monitoring water quality, minimizing cannibalism (e.g., via lowering stocking densities), or increasing biosecurity measures. Broodstock and larvae suppliers may be able to artificially genetically select shrimp with higher survival odds.&nbsp;</p><p>While aiming to reduce premature deaths aligns with preventing harm to animals, it may not improve aggregate affective welfare.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"9\" data-footnote-id=\"wz998hyru4s\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwz998hyru4s\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwz998hyru4s\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;If this is the metric of interest,&nbsp; there are reasons to be uncertain that lowering premature deaths should be an explicit aim in improving the welfare of shrimp. Because pre-slaughter mortality rates do not account for nonfatal impacts, fewer deaths do not necessarily indicate improved welfare for surviving shrimp, who may still suffer from prolonged, adverse (but sublethal) conditions. In fact, because dead shrimp do not have to endure negative experiences any longer, it is possible that premature mortality is actually preferable in the aggregate view of welfare. It depends upon the extent to which mitigating mortality improves the day-to-day experiences of shrimp who would have otherwise died.&nbsp;</p><p>Reducing pre-slaughter deaths may also change the wider industry\u2019s trajectory. Improving control of pond environments would mean fewer shrimp experience lethal and sublethal conditions. If early deaths were reduced, the number of shrimp that are born would also decline, if farmers were producing a fixed biomass. However, consumer demand outstrips supply when disease rates are high (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2020.107397\"><u>Asche et al., 2021, p. 4</u></a>), so it appears that farmers do not continue rearing shrimp until a certain threshold is met.&nbsp; Reducing deaths by intensifying farm practices may also mean the industry is better equipped to meet demand, causing more intensive farms to open over time, particularly because there are fewer land constraints on intensive farms (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jwas.12841\"><u>Boyd et al., 2022, Table 13</u></a>) and it costs less to produce a kilogram of shrimp when mortality is low (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2020.107397\"><u>Asche et al., 2021, Figure 3</u></a>). Moreover, the number of individual shrimp per kilogram would likely increase because intensive farms rear shrimp to a lower weight (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jwas.12718\"><u>da Silveira et al., 2020, Table 2</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-7345.2011.00507.x\"><u>Krummenauer et al., 2011, Table 1</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2017.05.038\"><u>Liu et al., 2017, Table 2</u></a>).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"10\" data-footnote-id=\"yxiby7drxkk\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyxiby7drxkk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyxiby7drxkk\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The overall number of farmed shrimp should, therefore, increase due to intensification. As such, we remain uncertain if reducing pre-slaughter mortality is a priority to improve farmed shrimp welfare. It again depends on whether the average shrimp experiences better or worse welfare on intensive farms.&nbsp;</p><p>If shrimp welfare interventions were to focus on reducing pre-slaughter mortality, it would make intuitive sense to concentrate on the life stages with the highest mortality rates, the larval stage. However, this intuition may be misguided. Reducing larval mortality only has welfare implications for larvae insofar as the cognitive complexity required for sentience develops over ontogeny (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ani9070440\"><u>Mellor, 2019, section 2.5</u></a>). If larvae are sentient, then this might indicate that we should focus our efforts on them. However, larvae are planktonic, so they do not make autonomous decisions around interacting with their environment until they become benthic in the postlarval stage. Some argue that without the ability to make free choices, there is no need for a feedback mechanism of pain (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10071-023-01773-2\"><u>Farnsworth &amp; Elwood, 2023</u></a>). So, if larvae cannot suffer but older shrimp can, it would be better to focus on reducing mortality after around 20 days. Although questions of sentience will always be tricky, some basic science on shrimp development could greatly reduce our uncertainty.&nbsp;</p><p>Although most mortality is seen in the larval and postlarval stages, these stages are short relative to the juvenile\u2013subadult stage. Hence, early-life experiences may not actually significantly impact the aggregate welfare of farmed shrimp. We are also uncertain what impact reducing early-life mortality would have on cumulative mortality because the extent to which mortality risk at later life stages depends on events in earlier stages is unknown. For example, if shrimp hatcheries achieved 100% larval shrimp survival, would more shrimp die when stocked into ongrowing ponds because weaker individuals survived? Or would the hatchery improvements increase the resilience of even the most vulnerable shrimp, leading to lower cumulative mortality?&nbsp;</p><p>Given all of these uncertainties, reducing pre-slaughter deaths should not be the focus of shrimp welfare efforts. Instead, pre-slaughter mortality rates should be considered alongside other indicators when seeking to improve conditions for farmed shrimp. With uncertainty surrounding the consequences of reducing larval deaths specifically, it may be more prudent for advocates to concentrate on improving conditions that could cause deaths in the ongrowing stage (postlarval and juvenile\u2013subadult life stages). Our data indicate that over 100 billion&nbsp;<i>P. vannamei</i> shrimp die in this period, which is the longest part of the farming cycle, presenting a significant opportunity for impact. In this case, pre-slaughter mortality rates can still serve as one metric of progress toward other objectives.</p><h1><br><strong>Acknowledgments</strong></h1><p><img style=\"width:624.037px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/hlzmenkzpp9wlfrmdxl5\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/kjxrg9pgvbmkbm85wvaj 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/ngsrw3pkqul5mp7exjto 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/hhenbppxpatorubxclek 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/dg5jglstgwcjgovqapwp 750w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/j35vsilh7znkynx2hudy 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/fqzo8perrc9znymjvss7 1500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/u6iugrgh2mnodxce02hx 2500w\"></p><p>This report is a project of <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/\">Rethink Priorities</a>\u2014a think tank dedicated to informing decisions made by high-impact organizations and funders across various cause areas.

I worry about Garbage in, garbage, out, that it will lead to overconfidence about what are ultimately just vibes, etc.</p><p>But I think if you are doing Bayes, you should at least try to do it right.</p><p>See, in Ea/rationalist circles, the discussion of Bayesianism often stops at bayes 101. For example, the \u201csequences\u201d cover the \u201cmammaogram problem\u201d, in detail, but never really cover how Bayesian statistics works outside of toy examples. The CFAR handbook doesn\u2019t either. Of course, plenty of the people involved have read actual textbooks and the like, (and generally research institutes use proper statistics), but I\u2019m not sure that the knowledge has spread it\u2019s way around to the general EA public.</p><p>See, in the classic <a href=\"https://medium.com/bright-minds-analytica/bayes-theorem-explained-66f572b875f6#:~:text=Bayes'%20Theorem%20derivation%20using%20this,therefore%2020%25%20miss%20it).\">mammogram problem</a> (I won\u2019t cover the math in detail because there are 50 different explainers), both your prior probabilities, and the amount you should update, are well established, known, exact numbers. So you have your initial prior of say, 1%, that someone has cancer. and then you can calculate a likelihood ratio of exactly 10:1 resulting from a probable test, getting you a new, exact 10% chance that the person has cancer after the test.</p><p>Of course, in real life, there is often not an accepted, exact number for your prior, or for your likliehood ratio. A common way to deal with this in EA circles is to just guess. Do aliens exist? well I guess that there is a prior of 1% that they do, and then i\u2019ll guess likliehood ratio of 10:1 that we see so many UFO reports, so the final probability of aliens existing is now 10%. [magnus vinding example] Just state that the numbers are speculative, and it\u2019ll be fine. Sometimes, people don\u2019t even bother with the Bayes rule part of it, and just nudge some numbers around.</p><p>I call this method \u201cpop-Bayes\u201d. Everyone acknowledges that this is an approximation, but the reasoning is that <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/02/if-its-worth-doing-its-worth-doing-with-made-up-statistics/\">some numbers are better than no numbers</a>. And according to the research of Phillip Tetlock, people who follow this technique, and regularly check the results of their predictions, can do e<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superforecasting:_The_Art_and_Science_of_Prediction\">xtremely well at forecasting geopolitical events</a>. Note that for practicality reasons they only tested forecasting for <i>near-term</i> events where they thought the probability was roughly in the 5-95% range.</p><p>Now let\u2019s look at the following scenario (most of this is taken from <a href=\"https://www.probabilisticworld.com/calculating-coin-bias-bayes-theorem/\">this tutorial</a>):</p><p><i>Your friend Bob has a coin of unknown bias. It may be fair, or it may be weighted to land more often on heads or tails. You watch them flip the coin 3 times, and each time it comes up heads. What is the probability that the next flip is also heads?</i></p><p>Applying \u201cpop-bayes\u201d to this starts off easy. Before seeing any flip outcomes, the prior of your final flip being heads is obviously 0.5, just from symmetry. But then you have to update this based on the first flip being heads. To do this, you have to estimate P(E|H) and P(E|~H). P(E|H) corresponds to \u201cthe probability of this flip having turned up heads, given that my eventual flip outcome is heads\u201d. How on earth are you meant to calculate this?</p><p>Well, the key is to stop doing pop-bayes, and start doing actual bayesian statistics. Instead of reducing your prior to a single number, you build a distribution for the parameter of coin bias, with 1 corresponding to fully biased towards heads, 0 being fully biased to tails, and 0.5 being a fair coin. With unknown information, you could use a \u201cuniform prior\u201d, where each value of bias between 0 and 1 is equally likely.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F6a841b7b-83fc-4de1-bf7b-e308509039ae_510x318.png\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dmEyvYzDLyx4WiJTw/skky8ixs9ppfppqcanmm\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dmEyvYzDLyx4WiJTw/gxmjeawjksqodblepwfq 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dmEyvYzDLyx4WiJTw/pefov20lowhc0slagda5 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dmEyvYzDLyx4WiJTw/cjglwitmxddccsdtrllx 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dmEyvYzDLyx4WiJTw/skky8ixs9ppfppqcanmm 1456w\"></a></p><p>When a flip happens, we use bayes theorem not once, but many times, for each potential value of bias. In this case, the P(E|H) is now: what is the probability of seeing this heads result, given that the coins bias is <i>this</i> value? Clearly, this is higher for higher coin biases. If we do this 3 times, we get a new distribution like the following:</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fc40d1f4c-fce0-46af-b5f2-c63b1472a1ea_502x327.png\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dmEyvYzDLyx4WiJTw/kdwjkbzdvjlrua63inut\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dmEyvYzDLyx4WiJTw/ojgtyvp7uu1vc6o0vq3w 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dmEyvYzDLyx4WiJTw/fh1buhlsk3cvtnigzzpc 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dmEyvYzDLyx4WiJTw/yfg6f4etvjme2hh5dy14 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/dmEyvYzDLyx4WiJTw/kdwjkbzdvjlrua63inut 1456w\"></a></p><p>When the time comes, how do we convert this into a probability we can bet with? We can do an expected value calculation, multiplying the probability mass of each slice by it\u2019s bias towards heads. In this case, that would add up to an 80% probability of getting heads next time.</p><p>What\u2019s actually happening here is that we are splitting our uncertainty into two pieces: the uncertainty of what the true facts about the world are, and the uncertainty about the future, given those facts. Perhaps to an omniscient being, the two are one and the same, but we are not omniscient beings, and at least in this scenario, this split works beautifully.</p><p>Importantly, when modelling this problem, the thing we keep track of is the distribution. If we\u2019ve seen the 3 heads, we don\u2019t memorize \u201c80%\u201d and then throw away the distribution, because what happens if we see another flip?</p><p>With this, you can see that a statement like \u201cI have a 95% credence that the bias is between X and Y\u201d makes perfect sense. But remember, the \u201cbias parameter\u201d is simply the probability that the next flip is heads! So it also makes sense to say \u201cI have a 95% credence that the \u201ctrue\u201d P(heads) is between X and Y\u201d, although perhaps you would admonish someone saying this for using confusing language.</p><p>Okay, hopefully I\u2019ve convinced you that probability of probabilities makes sense for a coin bias. But can you apply this to something like P(doom)?</p><p>Imagine Harriet is undecided between several models of the world. Specifically, she can\u2019t decide how <i>dangerous</i> AI is. (the following are simplified models, not meant to give the actual case for each camp).</p><p>She considers model 1: the super-doomer model. In this model, intelligence is infinitely scalable, and some form of FOOM is inevitable, and will lead to murderous AI. Extremely high intelligence also can invent massively powerful tech within days or months, so defeat is inevitable, and nobody will be able to stop it coming into existence.. In this scenario, it doesn\u2019t really matter what humanity does, the chance of humanity dying is still almost 100%.</p><p>But there is also model 2: the cautious optimist. This view says that FOOM can\u2019t happen, but that near AGI will be very powerful, and some of them could be in the hands of malevolent actors. However, since development is slow, there is a high chance of \u201cwarning shots\u201d, which would lead to constraints on AI that prevent disaster. If this view is true, then there is a good chance of survival, but we could still get wiped out if enough things go wrong at once, so there is maybe a 1% chance of doom.</p><p>And lastly there is model 3: the total AI skeptic. The total AI skeptic thinks we are in just in another hype cycle, like the ones preceding other AI winters. GPT is just a stochastic parrot, and will be forever plagued with hallucinations, and true AGI is still a century away. In this case, the chance of AI doom is like 1 in a trillion, and come from truly dumb scenarios like someone hooking GPT up to the nuclear launch codes.</p><p>Can you see? This is just the coins all over again. We split the uncertainty into uncertainty about the facts of the world, and uncertainty about what will happen when we \u201croll the dice\u201d, given those facts.</p><p>5% on model 1, 70% on model 2, and 25% model 3. If we do an EV point estimate of the full P(doom), we would get 5.7%, with the bulk of that coming from model 1. More on that later.</p><p>These worlds are quite broad, and we can further split them into sub-worlds. For example, she could think three variant \u201csub-models\u201d of model 2 are equally likely: ones in which the safeguards on bioweapons and nuclears are low, medium, or high security, with each model having slightly different chance of doom.</p><p>Now if Harriet encounters a news article on vulnerabilites in world security, she can shift among these sub-models, placing more weight on the more deadly ones. Note that this will have barely any effect on the other two models. This is the advantage of keeping track of the distributions and models: they can be updated individually.</p><p>Now that we\u2019ve figured out how to apply bayesian distributions to a question like P(doom), let\u2019s see what happens when you take this to the extreme, with a scenario I\u2019ll call the \u201chumble cosmologist paradox\u201d</p><h2><strong>Part 2: the humble cosmologist paradox</strong></h2><p><i>An intrepid EA journalist is investigating possible sources of existential risk, and decides to look at the risk of \u201csimulation shutdown\u201d. The case goes that our world may be a simulation by our descendants, as argued in Bostroms \u201csimulation argument\u201d, or a simulation by higher beings (for example, as part of a science experiment). If this is true, all intelligent life in our simulation is at risk of being deleted forever, if the simulators find us to no longer be interesting or useful for our purposes.</i></p><p><i>To answer this question, the journalist secures an interview with a successful cosmologist, noted for his humble nature.</i></p><p><i>Journalist:</i> What is your P(doom) from simulation shutdown?</p><p><i>Cosmologist:</i> \u201cUnfortunately, there is almost nothing I can tell you here.

I merely did the extra step of converting this into a final probability. To get this, we calculated the expected value of doom over your distribution. You said there was a 1% chance of between 1 in 10^100 and 1 in 10^99, so the risk of doom from that scenario is ~1%* 10^-99, = 3*10^-101.

And sure, in over 95% of your scenarios, we are in a safe world where the threat of shutdown is miniscule to non-existent. I agree that we are probably in such a world. But what matters, when assessing the question \u201cwill we all die from shutdown\u201d, are the worlds where shutdown <i>is</i> a substantial threat. You assigned a 1% chance to us living in <i>Danger-world</i>, where we stand a 10% to 100% chance of death. If you assigned a 1% chance to <i>Danger-world</i>, then why on earth would we say the odds of danger are <i>48 orders of magnitude</i> lower than 1%?</p><p>Cosmologist: Hang on, my original answer to the question of \u201cP(doom)\u201d was \u201cI don\u2019t know at all\u201d. I only put my distribution down because you forced me to quantify my ignorance. The distribution I made was as close to \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d as I could mathematically express. I went all the way down to 10^-100, a truly ridiculously small probability. And yet, with your method, suddenly \u201cI don\u2019t know\u201d translates to \u201c1 in 230\u201d? As if I\u2019m stating that I\u2019m more likely to die in a simulation shutdown than in a plane crash?</p><h2><strong>Part 3: the dangers of single numbers:</strong></h2><p>I\u2019m sure a lot of readers will be highly eager to bite the journalists bullet, and state that EV is just the correct way to calculate probability, and that the cosmologist really <i>should</i> claim a 1 in 230 chance of shutdown, if that was his probability distribution.</p><p>I don\u2019t agree that it's that obvious. Let\u2019s look at a scenario where the cosmologist is forced to make a decision based on this estimate:</p><p><strong>The Hypnosis device scenario:</strong></p><p><i>An inventor has secretly built a planet sized hypnosis device. If matrix lords exist and are watching us, this device is 100% guaranteed to hypnotize them into wanting to protect us, ensuring our safety from simulation shutoff forever.</i></p><p><i>The only small snag in the plan is that there is an unavoidable 1 in a thousand chance that the device will destroy the universe and kill all of humanity.</i></p><p><i>Somehow, the keys for the device end up in the hands of the humble cosmologist from earlier. A countdown warns that if he doesn\u2019t deploy it within 5 minutes, the opportunity will be lost forever, and no-one will be able to build such a device again. Should he deploy the device?</i></p><p>The cosmologist has never seen any matrix lords, has no hard evidence that they exist, and has a median model estimate of the matrix lord threat at 10^-50. Nonetheless, under the EV model, he should deploy the device. Under EV estimates, the odds of doom will drop fivefold, from 1 in 230 to 1 in a thousand.</p><p>I can tell you, if I was the cosmologist, there\u2019d be no way in hell I would push that button.</p><p>This type of scenario scenario is not as unlikely as it looks. Trade-offs exist between combatting different causes all the time.</p><p>For example, Eliezer Yudkowsky has suggested the world should be willing to bomb large AI datacentres as part of a global treaty, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1641953192761266177?lang=en\">even if the nations holding them threaten nuclear retaliation</a>. A good strategy if AI is super-dangerous, a potentially disastrous one if it isn\u2019t.</p><p>Imagine if such an agreement is made, with every country except for America. The US decides to rebel, saying they are building a giant AI megacluster for the sole purpose of curing cancer and other illnesses. The global treaty nations threaten to airstrike silicon valley if they don't cease, but the US refuses to back down and threatens nuclear war.&nbsp;</p><p>Suppose the decision whether to launch such a strike falls to Charlie, who thinks there is a 99% chance all AI risk is bullshit, but has a 1% credence in the doomer argument that the megacluster would kill all humans. Should he pull the trigger and airstrike silicon valley, actively killing civilian software engineers and risking nuclear war, despite being 99% convinced that AI is not an actual threat? Assuming the risk of extinction from a nuclear exchange isn't that high, the EV view would say that he should.&nbsp;</p><p>I disagree. I think he'd be crazy to pull the trigger!&nbsp;</p><p>What I have a problem with here is that the EV view seems to be <i><strong>privileging the unknown</strong></i>.</p><p>Asteroid strikes are very real existential threats, and we have a lot of evidence about them. We can see them, we can study them, we can get fairly good estimates for the frequency of really deadly ones. We have conclusive proof that we don\u2019t live in danger-world, because if we did humanity would not have had time to evolve. As a result, the odds of a dinosaur-extinction sized impact this century is something of the order of <a href=\"https://interestingengineering.com/science/what-is-the-probability-of-a-huge-civilization-ending-asteroid-impact\">1 in a million</a>.</p><p>Now compare that to the cosmologists assessment of matrix lords. Absolutely zero hard evidence, no reason to believe it\u2019s true. but under his assessment, the EV risk is 1 in 230. The reason is that he has no conclusive <i>disproof</i> of the danger-world hypothesis.&nbsp;</p><p>It seems to me that this strategy inherently rewards problems that are difficult to disprove or unfalsifiable. It feels like you can do the same analysis as the cosmologist for things like UFO\u2019s, ghosts, psychic mind control, and get the answer that they are bigger risks than asteroid risks.</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>I decided to publish this in draft form because I don't have a solution and I am not fully confident in my claims.

In 2015, the conservation group Rewild Argentina released their first batch of seven macaws into Iber\u00e1 National Park. They had to recapture the birds the next day<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\" data-footnote-id=\"t8d3sjxfo9\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreft8d3sjxfo9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnt8d3sjxfo9\">[1]</a></sup></span>. Iber\u00e1 is a large wetland in Argentina\u2019s Corrientes province. The macaws quickly&nbsp;became stuck in the sticky flooded ground, unable to take off. After a rest back in captivity, the birds were re-released. Within 5 days, two of the birds, whose lifespan in captivity is 60-80 years, were killed by&nbsp;wildcats.</p><p>After this incident, Rewild Argentina hired a trainer to teach them to avoid predators. In the training drill, the trainer encourages a cat or a falcon to attack an embalmed macaw, while macaw distress calls are played&nbsp;through a speaker. Next time they are released, the macaws aren\u2019t quite so naive.</p><p>Nearby, in El Impenetrable Park, conservationists from the same organisation raise and train predators that they want the macaws to avoid. Rewild Argentina plans to reintroduce species that were killed or driven out of Iber\u00e1 over the past century by cattle ranching and over-hunting\u2014 including the jaguar. Legally, the group couldn\u2019t import the jaguar from neighbouring countries, so they had to produce their own. Their first group came from Tania, a female jaguar from a local zoo and Quramta, a wild jaguar. Finding Quaramta was a stroke of luck.</p><p>In El Impenetrable, the jaguar aren\u2019t locally extinct, as they were in Iber\u00e1, but they are extremely rare. Quaramta was located after he left a single footprint by a river bank. Quaramta and Tania\u2019s cubs were raised in a thirty hectare enclosure, out of the reach of humans. Sebasti\u00e1n Di Martino, the conservation director, told me that if the cubs were raised by humans, then they would seek humans out when they were hungry. To train them to hunt for themselves, conservationists captured and released live prey into the enclosure, including nine-banded armadillo, caiman aligator, feral pigs and capybara. The training was a success. As of this year, one of Qaramta and Tania's cubs, Arami<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"2\" data-footnote-id=\"4nw888sqxm9\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4nw888sqxm9\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4nw888sqxm9\">[2]</a></sup></span>, has given birth in the wild.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7sNQnB6uGJyxpwbeS/rxdwxficx2gihp8xygr5\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7sNQnB6uGJyxpwbeS/nunrdzo8wtvapy7le3qc 130w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7sNQnB6uGJyxpwbeS/grci4adxiahu3mflz5f1 260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7sNQnB6uGJyxpwbeS/zfbhjc2ihfgwtb3p2dyg 390w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7sNQnB6uGJyxpwbeS/qmnqt1pswk4hz9dxsqz0 520w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7sNQnB6uGJyxpwbeS/ropq901s8krzo07w73u8 650w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7sNQnB6uGJyxpwbeS/smtwageg9hzha3r6uqic 780w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7sNQnB6uGJyxpwbeS/argrspdagcsu8rwmggl4 910w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7sNQnB6uGJyxpwbeS/sve0gjqjvl04scco61gn 1040w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7sNQnB6uGJyxpwbeS/hqsj3a9siegwqepgerdw 1170w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7sNQnB6uGJyxpwbeS/a3xxanmfovnanq8qsbjp 1254w\"><figcaption>Two formidable cubs born of wild Jaguar parents (press release from Rewilding Argentina)</figcaption></figure><p>Rewild Argentina\u2019s project is hard. It involves legislative wrangling with governments, an ongoing campaign to ingratiate the locals, and after all that, the deaths of their charges, sometimes at the hands of each other. Why are they doing it?</p><p>The last few centuries of land use drastically changed the ecosystem of Iber\u00e1. Cattle ranchers routinely burned down vegetation to make room for their cows, and locals hunted jaguar and other animals for skins to sell to wealthy europeans. Among the species driven to local extinction were giant anteaters which grew up to 8 feet long; bristly, pig-like collared peccaries; and the aforementioned green-winged macaws. Now, the land is occupied by capybara, previously the prey of the jaguar. Presently, they have nothing to fear. Di Martino told me that \u201cif you go out, the capybara are grazing by hundreds all day. They are not afraid of anything. All they do is eat, and eat\u201d.</p><p>The late Doug Tompkins<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"3\" data-footnote-id=\"6w2ksdl9qwp\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6w2ksdl9qwp\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6w2ksdl9qwp\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and his wife Kristine Tompkins use their philanthropy to restore wilderness. In 1999, they paid for the Conservation Land Trust to buy 1500km2&nbsp;of private land within the Iber\u00e1 nature reserve. This land was later gifted to the Argentinian government to form the Iber\u00e1 national park, with the agreement that Tompkin\u2019s Conservation, and later Rewild Argentina, could complete their reintroduction projects.</p><p>A quote from Doug on the Tomkin\u2019s conservation website states that their foundation \u201cplaces its highest priority in restoring the evolutionary process\u201d. In Iber\u00e1, this means returning the species that existed before the hunting and ranching, and coaxing them into fulfilling the same ecological roles that they had before. If this is done correctly, then populations would be able to survive without the input of conservationists, leaving the ecosystem, in Di Martino\u2019s words \u201ccomplete and fully functional\u201d.</p><p>This process is sometimes called rewilding. Rewilding can mean many things; as one of its academic proponents laments on this topic \u201cempirical studies are few whereas essays and opinion pieces predominate\u201d. And yet, it is a concept which leads conservation efforts around the world.&nbsp;In Iber\u00e1, the conservationists are following a process called \u201ctrophic rewilding\u201d. When top predators, are removed from the food chain, it can cause a 'trophic cascade'. With the predator no longer around, the size of the prey species' population increases, or their behaviour changes. Like the free-roaming capybara, they act less carefully, extending their habitat to areas that would previously have been too dangerous for them. This puts strain on the food source that the prey relies on. The loss of the predator \u2018cascades\u2019 down through the ecosystem, and the resultant over-grazing can totally change its shape.</p><p>Trophic rewilding is the idea that by replacing the top predator, the ecosystem will be able to return to its previous equilibrium, and the over-grazing will end. With the plants left to grow, the ecosystem will slowly be restored to something like its pre-human-influence state. Perhaps this would fulfil Tompkins\u2019 hope of restoring the evolutionary process. &nbsp;</p><p>Di Martino told me that he hoped to create an \u201cecology of fear\u201d through the reintroduction of jaguar. This ecological concept became popular when it was used to describe the effect of the reintroduction of wolves on the deer in yosemite. It refers to the change in behaviour in prey species when some of its previous grazing environments become unsafe. In Iber\u00e1, capybara wander about mostly unhindered by predation. Before the reintroductions, they shared Iber\u00e1 with two species of fox, caiman alligators, and a few species of rare bird. Di Martino hopes that with the addition of the jaguar, the capybara will be forced to graze down by the water, where they are less exposed, and that in turn, this will allow the grasslands to grow. A casualty of this change is of course, the capybara. Not only will they be killed and eaten by the jaguar, but, if the \u201cecology of fear\u201d works, they will spend more of their time in a state of heightened anxiety.</p><p>The reintroduction of predators isn\u2019t the world\u2019s most pressing ethical problem. The total number of these projects is still relatively small. The main threat to wild animals, even in this time of intense climactic change, remains human overuse; Overfishing, overhunting, depleting of animal populations. But the questions that reintroductions raise make us reflect on our duties to wild animals in general. When we intervene in an ecosystem so directly, aren\u2019t we partially responsible for the suffering caused by predation?</p><h2>The badness of predation</h2><p>\u201cIf we were able to create a world, would we create a world in which a certain proportion of the beings, in order to be able to survive, had to rip apart and devour others? &nbsp;No. That seems a pretty bad plan for a world.\u201d</p><p>Jeff McMahan is the White\u2019s Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Oxford. He believes that the world is made worse by the existence of predation. In his view, if we could eliminate predation from the wild, without causing harm to individual predators, then we should.</p><p>When explaining his argument to me, McMahan called it simple, \u201cto the point of being simplistic\u201d. In a nutshell, it runs: suffering is bad, predation causes suffering, therefore, predation is bad.</p><p>It isn\u2019t difficult to establish the idea that suffering is bad. We feel this intimately when we are suffering, and we can feel it with the same strength when our friends, or our pets suffer. If we see the inside of a factory farm, most of us become viscerally aware that other animals can suffer too.</p><p>We also care when we see an animal suffering in the wild. As McMahan writes: \u201cIf one were to happen upon a young animal that was about to be captured and slowly devoured alive, piece by piece, by a predator, one\u2019s impulse would be to frighten off the predator, if possible.\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"4\" data-footnote-id=\"oyvpg1qxvtj\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefoyvpg1qxvtj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnoyvpg1qxvtj\">[4]</a></sup></span></p><p>Predation clearly causes suffering, through painful killing, through animals being eaten alive, through the frequent fear and stress that prey animals experience in the \u201cecology of fear\u201d. If we also care about the loss of worthwhile or positive experience, then it is also bad when a happy animal dies before its time due to predation. For these reasons, predation is bad. If we take this argument on its face, and <i>if</i>&nbsp;the capybara are living worthwhile lives, then&nbsp;releasing the jaguar was a terrible mistake; a step back into a more violent past.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7sNQnB6uGJyxpwbeS/umwc995id8oumej1qtih\"><figcaption>A Capybara presumably not suffering in Iber\u00e1, with it's dimunitive friend, the \"Cattle Tyrant\". <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Capybara_with_its_Cattle_Tyrant,_Esteros_Del_Ibera,_Corrientes,_Argentina,_2nd._Jan._2011_-_Flickr_-_PhillipC.jpg\">Link</a>.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>This problem is larger than Iber\u00e1. The scale of suffering in nature is massive. A 2019 review of 1,114 individual studies suggested that for mammals, amphibians and reptiles, an average 55%<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"5\" data-footnote-id=\"ir1njdr088\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefir1njdr088\"><sup><a href=\"#fnir1njdr088\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;of deaths come from predation. Besides predation there are other painful causes of death and suffering that affect animals living in the wild. Burdensome parasites, disease, untreated injury, deaths from hunting and starvation. But predation is a particularly stark example, especially when we are choosing to introduce the predator. There isn\u2019t just suffering here, but also an injustice. When looking at an isolated act of predation, it seems clear that the predator, who will kill or consume hundreds of other animals, derives only limited benefit (a full stomach, a break before they need to hunt again), while the prey endures often intense suffering, and loss of life.</p><p>Sometimes the worst thing about the death of the prey isn\u2019t the direct suffeirng of the kill, but the life they couldn\u2019t live.&nbsp;In 1978, in a region of Brazil called Matto Grosso, scientists observed the killing of capybara by jaguar<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"6\" data-footnote-id=\"dbljqisyih7\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdbljqisyih7\"><sup><a href=\"#fndbljqisyih7\">[6]</a></sup></span>. In one indicative example, they describe an adult female jaguar stalking a capybara by a riverbank: \u201ca capybara sat about two meters from the water\u2019s edge while a female jaguar approached at a walk, screened by a bush. When 15m from her prey, she broke into a trot. Suddenly aware of its danger the capybara bolted for deep water. However, the jaguar grabbed it within 4m, in 15cm of water, and killed it with deep bites in the throat and the back of the head\u201d. These bites were typical, and very precise. An adult jaguar knows exactly where to bite to kill capybara quickly and efficiently, puncturing the brain. For the capybara, there is a short burst of fear and pain, but the process doesn\u2019t last long.</p><p>This isn\u2019t always the case. The method doesn\u2019t always succeed, especially for younger jaguar. Then, they have to resort to suffocating the prey, biting their neck closed until they die, prolonging the suffering. The hunting practices the scientists observed also seemed quite wasteful\u2013 because of an abundance of prey, two of the eleven kills they inspected were left without the jaguar consuming a single bite.</p><p>In McMahan\u2019s idea of utopia, this kind of killing would never happen. He stresses that there is little we can do today to achieve the end of eliminating predation. If we began to remove predators from ecosystems, we would be causing great harm to those predators, and also to other members of their ecosystem, through the trophic cascade effects outlined above. McMahan\u2019s hope is that in the future, we will have a better understanding of ecosystems and genetics. We will develop technologies that allow us to painlessly sterilise predator species when we know that their removal won\u2019t cause harm, or perhaps even more speculatively, we could genetically engineer predator species to become herbivores.</p><p>When I asked Sebasti\u00e1n Di Martino whether he worried for the capybara who will be prey to the jaguar, he replied: \u201cof course it's not good for the individual capybara that is being eaten, but we cannot do anything about it. That is nature.\u201d In philosophy, you can dismiss this kind of explanation by calling it a \"naturalistic fallacy\". In other words, you cannot get from a description of the way things are, to the conclusion that they are good, without an argument. In this case though, I don't think that would be fair.</p><p>Philosophers have attempted to discredit arguments by showing that they lead to the conclusion that predation is wrong. For example, the late 19th century philosopher David George Ritchie, responding to arguments for animal rights, wrote \u201cMust we not put to death blackbirds and thrushes because they feed on worms, or (if capital punishment offends our humanitarianism) starve them slowly by permanent captivity and vegetarian diet?\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"7\" data-footnote-id=\"3sa1s83kkd7\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3sa1s83kkd7\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3sa1s83kkd7\">[7]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;This shows that there is a strong intuition, one that these philosophers didn't even think needed spelling out, that we can't apply our usual obligations to prevent harm to the domain of nature. There are a few ways of making sense of this.</p><p>One is the idea that ecology is so complex that we cannot be confident of making the world better through interventions<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"8\" data-footnote-id=\"47aomhukmgs\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref47aomhukmgs\"><sup><a href=\"#fn47aomhukmgs\">[8]</a></sup></span>. Di Martino's statement that \"we can't do anything about it\" might reflect this idea. Many philosophers writing in the late 20th century, (Peter Singer and others) shared this view. Around this time, when the argument over our obligations to wild animals began in earnest, it was necessary for the author to state that, even if we do have some obligation to help them - because they suffer, or because it is us that harmed them - of course, there is nothing that we can do. The knock-on effects to different species might undo any good that we do. Though we may find it impossible not to help an animal in direct suffering, we shouldn't make any systematic interventions to attempt to make their lives better.</p><p>This isn't enough to explain the objection though. For one thing, McMahan agrees. When I asked him if his views on wild animal ethics had changed his responses to any projects that exist today, his answer was\u2014 basically no. We don't have the technology or the knowledge to make the major interventions into the structure of ecosystems that we would need to make to eliminate predation. If we are to intervene, he writes: \"We have to do it with extreme epistemic and scientific modesty and caution\u201d. But this doesn't mean that his argument is mere philosophical chatter; for McMahan, this means that we should put resources into developing this knowledge and capability, and when we have it, we should act.</p><p>Of course, Rethink Argentina's project is also intervening in an ecosystem in ways that will have unpredictable effects. The team used population viability analysis (PVA) techniques to model the population of their reintroduced animals<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"9\" data-footnote-id=\"4no7irp02ir\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4no7irp02ir\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4no7irp02ir\">[9]</a></sup></span>, up&nbsp;to 100 years in the future. But these models show different possible paths, not predictions. The team hopes that the jaguar will have an affect on the landscape through creating an ecology of fear, but they can't be too confident of this. They rely on analogies to other ecosystems, like the relationship between puma and guanaco<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"10\" data-footnote-id=\"c2qejlho0aq\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefc2qejlho0aq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnc2qejlho0aq\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;in patagonia. The science of this interaction is still young, so the results may surprise them. &nbsp;</p><p>The idea that 'it is nature' often means something deeper than just unpredictability. There is an intuition that nature, and the animals in it (including predators) are on their own course, which we shouldn't interrupt. When I spoke to conservationists, they often referred to this idea. Marc Bekoff, a conservationist and expert in animal behaviour, spoke of the bear\u2019s interest in living as a bear, the deer\u2019s in living like a deer. The implication was that we should value animals being able to live in the way that they would when left unimpeded by humans, in the habitat they evolved in. The conservationist [redacted] told me that he liked the idea of reintroducing Lynx to areas where deer lived, because \"deer currently don't live a natural life. They're more sedentary. Lynx will allow them to live the life they've evolved to live\". Later, I'll go more deeply into the conservationist's worldview, but for now, we just need to consider which of an animals interests we are more qualified to judge\u2014 whether they are better off living the way that they do in nature, or whether they would rather suffer less?</p><p>As we will see, if we accept that we should do what we can to reduce suffering in the wild, the path forwards, even in Iber\u00e1, isn't clear. There is a long distance between the utopian dream of a world without predation, and the best we can do for wild animals today.</p><h2>Predation, in the real world</h2><p>When I first spoke to a researcher in wild animal welfare \u2014Simon Eckerstr\u00f6m Liedholm from the Wild Animal Initiative (WAI)\u2014 I was met with a perspective even more cautious and nuanced than my engagement with the ethics had led me to expect. When asked about his opinion on predation, he seemed ready to correct for hasty moral arguments; \u201cI can think of many ways to produce a world without predators\u201d he said, \u201cincluding a universe without life\u201d.</p><p>We have to start, he said, by considering the \u201ccounterfactual\u201d. What would the ecosystem actually look like with and without predators? In the above section, I focused on describing the costs of predation to the individual, and explained the view that predation wouldn\u2019t happen in a perfect world. But our world isn\u2019t perfect\u2014 we are in a world of complex ecosystems, with many species to consider in each case. &nbsp;</p><p>Another WAI researcher, Luke Hecht, showed me the outline of a general approach to assessing welfare effects of adding predators to an ecosystem. You would need to work out the average welfare of the individuals already in the ecosystem, over the course of their life. Then, you would measure the sum of the averages<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"11\" data-footnote-id=\"xe7p12zdyo\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxe7p12zdyo\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxe7p12zdyo\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;before and after the addition of the new species. Ideally you would do this by introducing the predator within smaller corralled areas, so that less animals would be harmed if the reintroduction did end up being harmful.</p><p>This isn\u2019t what Rewild Argentina did. They modelled the projected populations of the species that they introduced,&nbsp;but with the aim of creating a functioning ecosystem that they could step back from, not ensuring that it would be a happy one.</p><p>Perhaps this is because they assume that wild animals living the lives that they evolved to live will have broadly positive welfare. This is the impression that I got from speaking with conservationists. This differs from the opinion fairly common within the effective altruism community, that the balance of suffering and pleasure in nature leans towards suffering. Which of these opinions is true matters greatly. In the context of Iber\u00e1, if the capybara have lives that are so full of suffering that they aren\u2019t worth living, then predation may actually<i>&nbsp;reduce </i>the suffering in the ecosystem.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"12\" data-footnote-id=\"a4wekmioefn\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefa4wekmioefn\"><sup><a href=\"#fna4wekmioefn\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Within effective altruism, arguments over the general level of welfare in nature have been mostly theoretical<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"13\" data-footnote-id=\"5xkxb5hoh8n\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5xkxb5hoh8n\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5xkxb5hoh8n\">[13]</a></sup></span>. But this doesn\u2019t have to be the case forever. I spoke with Heather Browning, a philosophy lecturer at Southampton University. Browning works on the philosophy of animal welfare, especially arguments about its measurement. Incidentally, she has a more positive view of general welfare<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"14\" data-footnote-id=\"b4olq49d7ku\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefb4olq49d7ku\"><sup><a href=\"#fnb4olq49d7ku\">[14]</a></sup></span>, partially because of her 15 years of experience working in zoos. At the zoo, Browning observed animals enjoying various aspects of their lives, from obviously good activities like eating and mating, to exercising agency and exploring new things. Browning argues that we shouldn\u2019t make decisions about wild animal welfare until we have figured out a way to measure it accurately. In the future, she hopes that we will develop a total welfare measure, based on a better science of consciousness, and clear biological markers.</p><p>But we don\u2019t need a perfect welfare measure in order to make better decisions. In the Iber\u00e1 case, we couldn\u2019t realistically model the whole ecosystem. This would involve settling questions like&nbsp;\u201cdo invertebrates suffer?\u201d,&nbsp;understanding all the population changes that would occur because of the introductions, from bugs up. Most welfare measures that currently exist require intimate knowledge of each species being assessed, the kind that you get from zoos, extensive observation in the wild, or in raising animals on farms. Clearly this isn\u2019t feasible for every insect living in Iber\u00e1. But it is possible for capybara.</p><p>Because of a successful appeal to the pope in 1784, capybara is not classified as a red meat and therefore can be eaten during lent. This creates a demand for capybara across south america, which farmers from countries like Venezuala and Brazil have stepped in to supply. Failed attempts to farm capybara in the 70s and 80s led to knowledge about the conditions in which capybara thrive. If capybara don\u2019t have access to bodies of water to play and bathe in, they develop skin conditions<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"15\" data-footnote-id=\"uch38oehhcn\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefuch38oehhcn\"><sup><a href=\"#fnuch38oehhcn\">[15]</a></sup></span>. Worse\u2014 if capybara aren\u2019t kept in social arrangements of their own choosing, internal fighting and killing can occur. The females in a group of capybara are generally related, and raise their children in common. If an outsider female is introduced, even if she seems comfortable with the group, she is liable to kill the children of the group\u2019s females. We know then, that capybara will be happier with access to water, and will suffer if outsiders are introduced to their group.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/7sNQnB6uGJyxpwbeS/pdtox5njiv6bashh8khj\" alt=\"File:Capivara(Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris).jpg\"><figcaption>Photo from <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Capivara(Hydrochoerus_hydrochaeris).jpg\">here</a>.</figcaption></figure><p>We don\u2019t just have to gesture at the possible welfare effects on the capybara. Researchers from Argentinian universities spent the dry seasons of 2018 and 2019 studying two populations of capybara, one living in the Brazilian Pantanal, an area with 6.7 jaguar per 100 km2&nbsp;and one living in Iber\u00e1, before the jaguar were fully introduced. In Iber\u00e1, there are on average 15 capybara every square kilometre. In the Pantanal, there are only 7. &nbsp;</p><p>The researchers stood on 1.5m tall ladders, watching capybara groups through their cameras. They recorded the proportion of time that the group members spent being vigilant\u2013 looking out for threats\u2013 and foraging for food. If they noticed the capybara group noticing them, the researchers left, and returned another day. They found that, in general, the Iber\u00e1n caybara spent just as long being vigilant as those in the pantanal (an average of 14% vs 13% of their time). However, the Panatanal capybara spent a larger proportion of their time foraging (62% vs 40%). The researchers thought that this may be because the Pantanal capybara spend their time alternating between periods of safety and heightened danger. When they are safe, they forage more vigorously, to make up for lost time when they are threatened.</p><p>The Iber\u00e1n capybara were less prepared for predation by big cats. The researchers performed a short-term vigilance test by playing jaguar sounds through a speaker, and later playing macaw sounds as a control. They observed that both groups would heighten their vigilance for a time after the jaguar sound, but the Iber\u00e1n group spent just as long being extra vigilant after the macaw sounds played\u2013 they didn\u2019t differentiate between the risks.</p><p>The researchers performed one more test. Not all welfare measures are species specific. Measuring the quantity of glucocorticoids in animal waste can be used as an indicator of stress. Browning noted that this measure is imperfect (it is produced during good excitement\u2013 sex and play\u2013 as well as bad excitement\u2013 fear and anxiety). For a rough estimate of endemic stress, the researchers collected and tested capybara excrement, measuring the levels of glucocorticoids. They would have expected that the capybara living in an area with jaguar would have had higher stress levels. To their surprise, they found no statistically relevant difference between the levels in the two locations. They proposed a few explanations for this. Perhaps the capybara were more stressed when they had predators, but also more stressed when they live in larger groups. Perhaps the capybara in the pantanal had adjusted to a higher level of danger, and regulated their stress levels. Overall, we don\u2019t know. But from this research, there were no clear flags that life without predation is less stressful for capybara. &nbsp;</p><p>We can use this information to suggest some conditional answers to the question\u2014 will the reintroduction of jaguar make life worse for the capybara? We can suppose that the population will fall once the predator is introduced\u2014 the population in Iber\u00e1 is double that of the pantanal. So we can expect the total welfare to go as low as about half of its current size, but, presuming that the stress levels don\u2019t change, the average welfare to remain about the same.</p><p>This is where philosophy comes back into the picture. If you care about the total welfare of populations, then (focusing only on the jaguar and capybara interaction) reducing the total welfare is bad. If you care about the average welfare, then whether adding predators is good or not would depend on the welfare of the predator. If the jaguar are better off than the capybara, then even if they are outnumbered 100 to 1, as they are in the pantanal, they will bump up the average welfare to higher than it was before they were introduced.</p><p>Alongside discussion of ideal populations, we still have to deal with the direct suffering costs. To transition to this new ecosystem, and to maintain it, many capybara will die in the jaws of jaguar. At least 111 capybara have been eaten by jaguar in Iber\u00e1 so far, 62% of their diet<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"16\" data-footnote-id=\"0uzt8a95k1se\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0uzt8a95k1se\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0uzt8a95k1se\">[16]</a></sup></span>. Often, this will be relatively painless and efficient. Sometimes, it will involve minutes of suffocation. If, as we have been assuming based on observations, the capybara were living worthwhile lives, then these killings will have cause a large loss of welfare to the individuals.</p><p>Neither the philosophy, nor the empirics are decisive here. The study is of limited size, and hasn\u2019t been replicated (though there are plans to repeat it later, to see the effect of the jaguar reintroductions on the capybara in Iber\u00e1). It doesn\u2019t explore the amount of time that the capybara spend in positive activities, like play, and mating. It doesn\u2019t explore the impacts of negative competition between groups. We have a way to go on wild animal welfare measurement, and even if this study was focused on measuring welfare, it wouldn\u2019t be able to give us a very fine grained answer. The philosophy is also inconclusive. Even if we agree that welfare is our priority, our views on ideal populations will determine our reaction to the reintroduction. We would care the most if we are concerned with the loss of the life the capybara could have lived, and the total welfare of populations, and the least if we only care about the suffering caused during the killing, and the average welfare of populations. These questions aren\u2019t easy to resolve.</p><p>If you only care about welfare\u2013 you probably wouldn\u2019t reintroduce the jaguar until there were better measures of wild animal wellbeing. Purely on welfare grounds, we are left uncertain of whether the reintroduction of jaguar (not to mention the other species setting up home in Iber\u00e1) will be a neutral action, or something to lament. But this project is going ahead, and it is going ahead for ethical reasons. Why? What exactly are the ethics of conservation, that to some, justify the risk of increased suffering?</p><h2>The world according to conservationists</h2><p>Conservationists come at the decision from a different starting place, with a set of motivations that aren\u2019t primarily focused on suffering.</p><p>When Michel E. Soul\u00e9, biologist, was founding the&nbsp;field of conservation biology, he called it a \u201ccrisis discipline\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"17\" data-footnote-id=\"jv037mshdg\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjv037mshdg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjv037mshdg\">[17]</a></sup></span>. He compared it to cancer biology, a discipline which brings together expertise from various fields, immunology, pharmacology, virology, and unites them to achieve a specific goal\u2014 the understanding and treatment of cancer. Conservation biology is similar in its calling upon a range of professional expertise (in genetics, animal physiology, population biology), but also in its normative status; it is united by the a moral goal, \u201cto provide principles and tools for preserving biological diversity\u201d.</p><p>The real uniting force in conservation is its urgency. The IUCN records nine hundred species that have gone extinct in the last five hundred years, and that\u2019s likely to be a massive underestimate. The current speed of extinctions is a hundred to a thousand times higher than earth\u2019s baseline extinction rate<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"18\" data-footnote-id=\"mw26sadmll9\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmw26sadmll9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmw26sadmll9\">[18]</a></sup></span>.

If we want to compare the importance of wild animal welfare with conservation priorities, we need to understand what drives both.</p><p>Doug and Kristine Tompkins were friends with Aarne N\u00e6ss, a Norwegian mountain climber and philosopher, whose writings are often referenced by Soul\u00e9. They mention N\u00e6ss as inspiration on their website<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"21\" data-footnote-id=\"l7kttkpxqg\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefl7kttkpxqg\"><sup><a href=\"#fnl7kttkpxqg\">[21]</a></sup></span>, and the line I quoted earlier about \u201crestoring the evolutionary process\u201d is in line with his philosophy. N\u00e6ss was the co-founder of a movement called \u201cdeep ecology\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"22\" data-footnote-id=\"7yr078d9cqj\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7yr078d9cqj\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7yr078d9cqj\">[22]</a></sup></span>, a response to what he deemed \u201cshallow\u201d approaches to conservation; those that prioritised actions which would bring benefits to humans. In his \u201cplatform of deep ecology\u201d, written with another philosopher, George Sessions, he writes that \u201cAbundance and diversity of life forms are values in-themselves and contribute to the flourishing of human and non-human life on earth\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"23\" data-footnote-id=\"90y7dhys7tc\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref90y7dhys7tc\"><sup><a href=\"#fn90y7dhys7tc\">[23]</a></sup></span>. Returning species to Iber\u00e1 increases their abundance, and restores ecological diversity to the ecosystem (over the long run, as long as the populations survive and establish relationships as expected). Soul\u00e9 gave a more science-focused account of the ethics of conservation in his seminal <i>What is Conservation Biology?</i>&nbsp;He wrote that conservation biologists believed four normative statements, including the claim that \u201cevolution is good\u201d. Doug\u2019s argument for this claim echoes Soul\u00e9s\u2014 all the value that we see in wilderness come from evolution, so we should respect the process.</p><p>Earlier in the article, McMahan asserted that suffering is bad. You can\u2019t really argue for this claim; either you agree, or you don\u2019t. When people do argue about claims like this, their arguments are designed to show you that really you do care\u2014 only, you haven\u2019t noticed. Arguments for the value of nature, the intrinsic value of species, or the intrinsic value of biodiversity, are the same. On his claim \u201cdiversity of organisms is good\u201d, Soul\u00e9 writes that \"such a statement cannot be tested or proven\". When I asked conservationists why they cared about biodiversity, they didn\u2019t have philosophical arguments ready. They were used to speaking to people who took it for granted that there was something of value in nature, even if they disagreed on methods for protecting it. Marc Bekoff put it best. When I asked him to explain why biodiversity mattered, he responded: \u201cto be honest with you, I would be shocked if anybody said that it didn't matter [...] I've never talked to anybody ever who would have marginalized biodiversity.\u201d</p><p>Heather Browning told me that she also feels strongly about the diversity of species. She doesn\u2019t like the idea of a world with no orangutans, or leaf insects. But when she examines the intuition, she realises that she doesn\u2019t feel the same for mosquitos. This suggests to her that the intuition is <i>fallible</i>; we can\u2019t turn the feeling into the rule \u2018never cause a decrease in biodiversity\u2019 because we wouldn\u2019t want to apply it in all cases. If she is right, it also suggests that we don\u2019t value biodiversity intrinsically. If we don\u2019t value it unconditionally, we must value it for some further reason\u2014 like its impact on our health or its beauty.</p><p>N\u00e6ss and Soul\u00e9 both knew that their arguments wouldn\u2019t convince everyone, or even describe all the reasons that conservationists cared. The urgency of their movement was enough for them to make&nbsp;a coalition with a broad range of interests<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"24\" data-footnote-id=\"oo94cqjk54f\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefoo94cqjk54f\"><sup><a href=\"#fnoo94cqjk54f\">[24]</a></sup></span>. In the present, conservationists often mention the intrinsic value of biodiversity as a motivation alongside a range of others.</p><p>When I spoke to Di Martino about the motivations behind Rewild Argentina\u2019s project, he began with ideas similar to N\u00e6ss and Soul\u00e9\u2014 \u201cwe respect all forms of life\u201d he said. He expressed that he didn\u2019t consider himself \u201cat the top of nature\u201d. Partially, the animals are being brought back for their own benefit. But in the rest of the conversation, he focused on effects that the reintroductions would have on humans, both directly, through the impact the increased tourism would have on the local economy, and more indirectly, through the effect on climate. In our conversation, he was animated when explaining the more everyday, human impacts of the project. Bringing environmental tourism to the area is giving better paid jobs to men and women alike, freeing men from the exploitative ranching industry and women from a life with few options outside of the home. A local town, for years known only as Concepci\u00f3n, now proudly goes by its full name, Concepci\u00f3n del Yaguaret\u00e9 Cor\u00e1\u2014 conception, a place where they have jaguar.</p><p>He also made claims about the impact of the Iber\u00e1 project on the climate crisis. These claims are hard to quantify. If the ecology of fear works, and capybara are driven further towards rivers, more plants could grow. This would result in more sequestration of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, into organic compounds. But is this the most important outcome of the project, or does this have more in common with a car park which gets its green credentials by erecting a beehive? Scientists sometimes argue that the biodiversity crisis and the climate crisis are intricately linked. In a recent article on nature\u2019s<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"25\" data-footnote-id=\"xiyogbounvi\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxiyogbounvi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxiyogbounvi\">[25]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;comment section, a collection of researchers published a plea to further investigate the links between biodiversity and climate change<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"26\" data-footnote-id=\"t7mfhydnlh\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreft7mfhydnlh\"><sup><a href=\"#fnt7mfhydnlh\">[26]</a></sup></span>. They pointed out that though there are studies on a range of instances of biodiversity, in general \u201cthe details of the intricate feedback loops between biodiversity decline and climate change are astonishingly under-studied\u201d. They make the case that climate scientists and ecologists should pursue a joint agenda, but until now, the two disciplined have been overly siloed. This means that Iber\u00e1\u2019s effect on the climate is still speculative.</p><p>The motivation for conservation can come from a deeply intuited philosophical basis\u2013 the intrinsic value of biodiversity\u2013 but in reality, projects that go ahead are often win-wins. Alongside rebuilding an area of nature which the Tompkins think of as having intrinsic value, Rewild Argentina is already bringing tourists into the area, and improving the livelihoods of the people that live there. They are bringing back animals that people want to see, and perhaps doing something for the climate along the way.</p><hr><p>How does welfare fit into the conservationist\u2019s picture? How do you get from the idea that capybara has intrinsic value, to the act of introducing a predator to eat it? When I asked Di Martino about the suffering of wild animals, he talked about the care that his team gives to animals in transit to the Iber\u00e1, or <i>before</i>&nbsp;they are fed to the jaguar. As the project develops, he explained, the focus of the work moves from the individual animal (and their welfare), to the population level (is the population of pampas deer growing or declining?), and finally, to the ecosystem (is the local flora recovering?). Whenever I pushed a question on animal suffering, he would respond that this was the way of nature, or this was the role of the prey species.</p><p>Soul\u00e9 also felt this way. In his paper, he wrote that &nbsp;\u201cAlthough disease and suffering in animals are unpleasant, and, perhaps, regrettable, biologists recognize that conservation is engaged in the protection of the integrity and continuity of natural processes, not the welfare of individuals [...] evolution, as it occurs in nature, could not proceed without the suffering inseparable from hunger, disease, and predation\u201d .</p><p>Not all conservationists share this view. \"Compassionate conservation\" is an approach to conservation which aims to take the individual animal seriously, throughout the entire process. At the third international compassionate conservation conference, Professor Ngaio Beausoleil, a researcher whose work straddles animal welfare and conservation, convened a workshop. The participants were academics and practitioners who wanted to see greater collaboration between animal welfare research and conservation. They argued that conservation focuses too much on \"fitness\", or the chances of a population surviving in its ecosystem, and not on \"feelings\", or the animal's experiences of their life.</p><p>Marc Bekoff, who edited a book on compassionate conservation, &nbsp;spoke to me from colorado, where conservationists want to reintroduce wolves. Bekoff was keen to share his concern about this project. As a conservationist, he would be happy if wolves were brought back. But as a compassionate conservationist, he is concerned that the team bringing them in knows little about wolf behaviour, and might be hurting the groups that they take the wolves from. He\u2019s watched this happen in colorado before, where the during the first attempt at Lynx reintroduction in the year 2000. \u201cIt was very clear from the start that the proper ecology studies about food abundance had not been done. It was predictable that the early animals that were dumped would die, and the first four died of starvation.\u201d Bekoff wants a conservation movement that has \u201cfirst, do no harm\u201d and \u201cevery individual counts\u201d as its mantras. He is happy to see new conservation projects being done, as long as they do their best to treat the animals with respect.</p><p>The Wild Animal Institute, in contrast, would rather that many present projects weren\u2019t done until we know more about the welfare effects. From this perspective, initiatives like introducing the jaguar, done without a focus on welfare, are a moral roll of the dice. But since the conservationists are acting anyway, WAI researchers see conservation as an opportunity to develop better welfare science, collecting real-world data on welfare impacts. As the field of Welfare Biology&nbsp;develops, and we gain a better understanding of wild animal welfare, perhaps conservationists will find it easier, maybe even natural, to take welfare into account.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnote-section footnotes\" data-footnote-section=\"\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" data-footnote-item=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"1\"

I think it would also be worth including metrics related to cost and cost-effectiveness.

I do not know to what extent groups are already doing calculations like the ones I did in this post, but I guess there is room to do more. The programs will often not be directly comparable. For example, 80,000 Hours\u2019 1-on-1 program is arguably further down the <a href=\"https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/the-funnel-model\"><u>funnel</u></a>&nbsp;than The Introductory EA Program. However, sometimes they will. For instance, my sense is that many groups run programs with a similar format and goal of The Introductory EA Program. Best practices could eventually be found by looking into the programs doing well (having high cost-effectiveness), although one would have to be mindful there are other factors which influence how well a program does besides how well it is run.</p><p>There are some hurdles to putting the above vision into practice. My sense is that groups are not tracking super well inputs, outputs, nor <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/theory-of-change\"><u>outcomes</u></a>&nbsp;(e.g. career changes)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"3\" data-footnote-id=\"3tckjf13zsu\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3tckjf13zsu\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3tckjf13zsu\">[3]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>It would also be challenging for groups to coordinate to come up with comparable metrics.

For instance, it could provide a Bayesian prior for adjusting noisy cost-effectiveness estimates of interventions that have not yet been thoroughly evaluated. Empirically, what is the distribution of cost-effectiveness within and between the most impactful charitable causes, and what does this imply for priority setting? (Jamison et al. 2006; Vivalt 2015; 2020)</p></blockquote><p><strong>Accounting for externalities</strong></p><blockquote><p>Many interventions in global health and beyond have significant externalities on individuals other than the direct recipients of the intervention. How should such indirect effects be incorporated in cost-effectiveness analysis?</p></blockquote><p><strong>Comparing extending/creating life with improving life</strong></p><blockquote><p>How do social welfare gains from improvements in people\u2019s quality of life (e.g. improvements in health or consumption) compare to social welfare gains from extending people\u2019s lives or bringing new people into existence? (Cf. Luyten et al. 2022)&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p><strong>Metrics for health-related interventions - DALYs/WELLBYs</strong></p><blockquote><p>The cost-effectiveness of health interventions is often measured in terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) per dollar. However, the DALY approach has well-known limitations, and there are other approaches such as using wellbeing-adjusted life years (WELLBYs) (e.g., Layard and Oparina 2021).

It's also correct if we want to buy a thousand bednets. However, we generally ask \"where should I spend my money for the highest returns?\" rather than \"what would be the cheapest I would need to pay for some amount of bednets?\". So, say AMF expects to fundraise $1 million, which producer should they choose?</p><p>You, again, reason:</p><blockquote><p>I want AMF to buy as many bednets as possible with the same amount of money. If I choose <strong>NetCo</strong>, I know that sometimes I'll buy cheap nets and sometimes expensive nets. All in all, the more money I put into it the more nets I'd get and the closer the cost distribution of these nets to the actual cost probability. In this case, we can average everything out (say, by grouping together cheap+expensive nets for the average price of $2 per two nets), and we expect to buy about a million bednets.&nbsp;</p><p>Shouldn't it again be basically the same for <strong>SleepWell</strong>? No? Okay, I'll do this as accurately as I can.</p><p>Going with <strong>SleepWell</strong>, we would spend $1 million on either cheap or expensive nets, or anything in between. That's complicated to calculate so maybe I should first try a silly edge-case. Say the cost is either $0.01 or $1.99 with equal probabilities. The average cost is indeed $1. We have two cases:</p><ol><li>If the cost turns out to be $1.99, then with $1 million we'd get roughly 500 thousand bednets.&nbsp;</li><li>If the cost is $0.01, we can buy 100 million bednets.</li></ol><p>Oh shit, that's a lot!&nbsp;</p><p>Wait, even if the cost could have been $199 or $199,999 instead of $1.99 that would still mean that in expectation we'd get more than 50 million bednets, much higher than NetCo.
