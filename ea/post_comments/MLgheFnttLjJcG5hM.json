Rather to highlight that the US is spending huge amounts of money upgrading their nuclear weapons in a world which would be far better off without more nuclear weapons, and there has been (to my knowledge) almost no public debate or even political debate over whether upgrading nuclear missiles is the right thing to do. It just goes on behind the scenes.&nbsp;<br><br>To be clear, this is not about some utopian vision of a world without the need for nuclear deterrence. The US still has 900 submarine-based nuclear missiles.

I suspect the more important factor in whether this is good or bad will instead be the direct effects of this on nuclear risk (I assume some parts of the upgrade will reduce nuclear risk \u2013 for instance, better sensors might reduce the chances of a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1983_Soviet_nuclear_false_alarm_incident\">false positive</a> of incoming nuclear weapons \u2013 while other parts will increase the risk).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Isn't there a contradiction between the idea that nuclear weapons serve as a deterrent and the idea that we need to upgrade them? The implication would seem to be that the largest nuclear missile stockpile on the planet still isn't a sufficient deterrent, in which case what exactly would constitute a deterrent? &nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Not necessarily \u2013 the upgrade likely includes many aspects for reducing the chances that a first-strike from adversaries could nullify the US stockpile (efforts towards this goal could include both hardening and redundancy), thus preserving US second-strike capabilities.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>More to the point, is this decision being taken by people who see nuclear war as a zero-sum game - we win or we lose</p></blockquote><p>I'm sure ~everyone involved considers nuclear war a negative-sum game.

It feels like the armed forces and the weapons manufacturers, who are two of, but not the only domains in which expertise is relevant, have an overwhelming voice in these decisions. It's not clear to me that other voices are sufficiently heard, for example EA groups doing research looking at how to minimise the risk of nuclear war.&nbsp;</p><p>2. In addition to the limited range of expertise involved, there is a high risk of bias. Investing more money in nuclear weapons has different value for different people. Depending on your opinions, you may conclude that it is good or bad for a typical American citizen. However, there is a very small group of people for whom &nbsp;the expected value is extremely positive - arms manufacturers and the armed forces.
