This includes <a href=\"http://Unjournal.org\">Unjournal.org</a>; we are looking to prioritize the evaluation of research relevant to animal welfare, and we have built/are building a 'field specialist' team focusing on this.&nbsp;<br><br>&nbsp;Some expansion on the theory of change/paths to impact/logic model for some of the leading cases could be particularly helpful. (You mention we should reach out to Martin Gould on this -- I plan to do so.)</p><p>While some of these might be amenable to simpler 'desk research' (literature reviews, simple BOTECs, coalescing information), I think many of the more interesting ones could require some heavier lifting in terms of research depth and methodological expertise. I'm not saying the '80% of the 80/20 research' would not necessarily have value here, but it is my sense is that more in=depth rigorous work may be warranted, and potentially worth funding.</p><p>For example:<br>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;By how many years do animal welfare corporate commitmets speed up reforms that might eventually happen anyway due to factors like government policy, individual consumer choices, or broad moral change?</p></blockquote><p>This is a challenging causal inference question; while case studies and 'plausible inference' from qualitative approaches could have value. It could also potentially be addressed quantitatively with methods like difference-in-differences, synthetic panels, and natural experiments. This might also require some expertise in dynamic/time-series models. It seems high-value, given that funding corporate campaigns have been claimed to be among the highest-impact animal welfare opportunities.</p><blockquote><p>What percentage of people will be veg*n in 20, 50, or 100 years?</p></blockquote><p>I guess the ToC here is that this informs the priority one should give to interventions to improve farmed-animal welfare conditions ... because 'if most people are vegan anyways, it matters less. Or perhaps this is about the cost side of increasing global prosperity (meat-eaters dilemma) or supporting pro vs anti-natal policies?<br><br>I suspect predicting this out 100 years will be extremely difficult, in the sense that quantitative models and expertise might have little value. But for 10 or 20 years out, I think social science modeling expertise could be meaningful.&nbsp;</p><p>But some of the other questions seem more straightforwardly amenable to quantitative social science work, including careful and feasible RCTs, and sometimes non-RCT causal inference methods, and Bayesian statistical inference and presentation. E.g., &nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>How impactful would it be to get already sympathetic celebrities to speak up more on animal welfare?</p></blockquote><p>Looking at simple before/after comparisons, or aggregating casual media reporting on this could be misleading. An RCT here seems feasible.</p><blockquote><p>...What is the impact on sales of labeling laws that restrict the terms that can be used to describe/sell PBMAs and other plant-based products? &nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>This seems like something mainstream academic/professional economists might consider or already be considering, perhaps in conjunction with legislative testimony or court cases. It seems amenable to formal empirical analysis, perhaps in the 'empirical industrial organization/quantitative marketing' literatures. But it is by no means simple... to estimate impact on quantities sold, considering competitive price responses, responses of substitute products, time trends and seasonality, etc.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "david_reinstein"}}]
