Additional comments may be available at the </i><a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2014/09/11/challenges-of-transparency/\"><i>original post</i></a><i>.</i></p><p>When we first started GiveWell, we wondered why major staffed foundations didn\u2019t write more about the thinking behind their giving (and the results of it), in order to share their knowledge and influence others. We\u2019ve tried to counterbalance normal practice by making <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/about/transparency\">transparency</a> one of our core values.</p><p>Our commitment to transparency is as strong as it\u2019s ever been; we derive major benefits from it, and we believe there\u2019s far too little public information and discussion about giving. At the same time, we\u2019ve learned a lot about just why transparency in philanthropy is so difficult, and we no longer find it mysterious that it is so rare. This post summarizes what we see as the biggest challenges of being public and open about giving decisions.</p><p>Summary:</p><ul><li>Everything we publish can help or hurt our brand. We put substantial effort into the accuracy, clarity and tone of our public content.</li><li>In most cases, writing about our thinking and our results also means writing about other organizations (the organizations we recommend and support, both via our traditional work and via the <a href=\"http://www.open-philanthropy.org/\">Open Philanthropy Project</a>). We don\u2019t want to hurt or upset other organizations, and we put substantial effort into making our public content both (a) amenable to the organizations we write about and (b) fair and complete in its characterization of our views.</li><li>The level of transparency we seek is unusual, meaning it often takes substantial effort to communicate our expectations and processes to the organizations we recommend and support.</li><li>The interaction of the above challenges can make it extremely difficult and time-consuming to write publicly about grants, recommendations, and grantee progress. In addition, it can be the cause of major delays between drafting and publication: much of our content takes weeks or months to go from draft to published piece, as we solicit feedback from parties who might be affected by the content.</li><li>The costs of transparency are significant, but we continue to feel they are outweighed by the benefits. Public writeups help clarify and improve our thinking; they play a major role in our credibility with our audience; and they represent a step toward a world in which there is far more, and better, information available to help donors give well.</li><li>We don\u2019t think it necessarily makes sense for all philanthropic organizations to put as much effort into transparency as we do. Rather, we see transparency as one of the core areas in which we are trying to experiment, innovate, and challenge the status quo.</li></ul><h1>Challenge 1: protecting our brand</h1><p>Because of the work we\u2019ve put into explaining and defending our positions in the past, we benefit substantially from our reputation and from word-of-mouth. Nobody checks every statement and footnote on our site; even our closest readers rely often on the idea that content under the GiveWell name has a certain degree of thoroughness, reliability and clarity. (We believe a common way of approaching GiveWell content is to <i>spot-check</i> the occasional claim, rather than checking all claims or no claims; in order for our content to perform well under arbitrary spot-checks, our content needs to have fairly consistently high quality.)</p><p>Somewhat ironically, this dynamic means we\u2019re hesitant to publish content that we haven\u2019t thought through, checked out, and worded carefully (in order to say what we feel is important and defensible, and no more). We feel that poorly researched or poorly worded content could erode the brand we\u2019ve built up, and could make people feel that they have to choose between checking everything we write themselves and simply placing less weight on our claims. (In general, most of our busy audience would likely choose the latter in this case.)</p><p>Giving decisions are generally impossible to justify purely with appeals to facts and logic; there are many judgment calls and a great deal of guesswork even in the most seemingly straightforward decisions. This makes it particularly challenging to write about them while preserving a basic level of credibility and a strong brand, and we don\u2019t know of clear role models for this endeavor. (A funder once told me that s/he didn\u2019t want to publish the reasoning behind giving decisions because this reasoning wasn\u2019t up to academic standards, and so would not be perceived as reasonable or credible.)</p><p>Rather than aim to write only what we can back with hard evidence, and rather than write everything we believe regardless of the level of support, we put a great deal of effort into being clear about why we believe what we believe - whether it is because of solid evidence or simply a guess. (Phrases such as \u201cwe would guess that\u201d are common in our content.) This allows us to share a good deal of our thinking (not just the parts of it that are strongly supported) while still maintaining credibility. But it requires a careful, thoughtful, and somewhat distinctive writing style that has been an ongoing challenge to develop and maintain.</p><p>As our brand becomes stronger, our audience becomes broader and our staff grows, the challenges of maintaining the appropriate style - and backing up our statements appropriately - intensifies. For example, we now put most public pages through a \u201cvet\u201d - in which a staff member who was not involved in writing the page goes carefully through its statements, making sure that each is appropriately supported - before publication. (We do not do this for all pages, and we generally do not do it for blog posts, which are more informal.)</p><h1>Challenge 2: information about us is information about grantees</h1><p>We seek to be highly open about the lessons we\u2019ve learned and the results we\u2019ve seen from our work - including developments that contradict our expectations and reflect poorly on our earlier decisions (which are often particularly valuable for learning). Because our function is to recommend other organizations for donations and grants, being open about our performance almost always means being open about another organization\u2019s performance as well. (For simplicity, the rest of this section will refer to GiveWell-recommended organizations, as well as <a href=\"http://www.open-philanthropy.org/\">Open Philanthropy Project</a> grantees, as \u201cgrantees.\u201d)</p><p>While we want to be open, we don\u2019t want to create a dynamic in which working with us creates significant risks for grantees. (This could lead good organizations to avoid working with us.) So we\u2019ve had to find ways of balancing the goal of openness with the goal of making it \u201csafe\u201d for an organization to work with us. Doing so has been a major challenge and the subject of many long-running discussions, both internally and with grantees.</p><p>Things we\u2019ve done to strike the right balance include:</p><ul><li>Putting serious effort into communicating expectations up front. Simply saying \u201cwe value transparency\u201d is not enough to communicate to a grantee what sorts of things we might want to write in the future. We generally try to send examples of past things we\u2019ve written (such as our 2013 updates on <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/11/26/change-in-against-malaria-foundation-recommendation-status-room-for-more-funding-related/\">Against Malaria Foundation</a> and <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/11/29/rethinking-scis-evidence-of-impact-2/\">Schistosomiasis Control Initiative</a>), and we often try to agree on an initial writeup before going forward with a grant or recommendation.</li><li>Giving grantees ample opportunity to comment on pending writeups that discuss them. There have been cases in which a writeup has been the subject of weeks, or even months, of discussion and negotiation.</li><li>Giving grantees a standing opportunity to retract non-public information, including even the fact that they\u2019ve participated in our process. (Organizations considered as potential <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">top charities</a> have often been given the option to withdraw from our process and have us publish a page simply saying \u201cOrganization X declined to participate in our process\u201d; this option has sometimes been invoked quite early in the process and has sometimes been invoked quite late, after a draft writeup has been produced and shared with the organization.)</li><li>Being generally hesitant to run a writeup that a grantee is highly uncomfortable with. We\u2019re often willing to put substantial effort into working on a writeup\u2019s language, until it both (a) communicates the important aspects of our views and (b) minimizes grantees\u2019 concerns about giving misleading impressions.</li><li>We are in the process of creating a more formal process for negotiating about transparency with grantees up front. This process will draw on the <a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2014/07/24/partnership-with-the-pew-charitable-trusts/\">agreement we negotiated with The Pew Charitable Trusts</a>.</li></ul><h1>Challenge 3: transparency is unusual</h1><p>In general, unusual goals are harder to achieve than common goals, because the rest of the world isn\u2019t already set up to help with unusual goals. When we ask for budgets, project plans, confidentiality agreements, proof of 501(c)(3) status, etc., people immediately know what we\u2019re seeking and are ready to provide it. When we bring up transparency, people are often surprised, confused, and cautious. In some cases people underestimate how much we plan to write, which could lead to problems later; in other cases people fear that we will disclose information carelessly and indiscriminately, leading them to be be highly wary. Discussions about transparency often involve extensive communication between senior staff at both organizations, in order to ensure that everyone is clear on what is being requested and expected.</p><p>We believe that we could achieve the same level of transparency with far less effort if our practices were even moderately common and familiar.</p><h1>The difficulty of writing about grants</h1><p>The interaction of the above challenges can make it extremely difficult and time-consuming to write publicly about grants, recommendations, and grantee progress. We can\u2019t simply \u201copen-source\u201d our process: each piece of public content needs to simultaneously express our views, maintain our credibility, and be as amenable as possible to other organizations discussed therein. Much of our content takes weeks or months between drafting and publication.</p><p>With this in mind, we no longer find it puzzling that existing foundations tend to do little substantive public discussion of their work.</p><h1>Benefits of transparency</h1><p>The costs of transparency are significant, but we continue to feel they are outweighed by the benefits.</p><p>First, the process of drafting and refining public writeups is often valuable for our own thinking and reflection. In the process of discussing and negotiating content with grantees, we often become corrected on key points and gain better understanding of the situation. Writing about our work takes a lot of time, but much of that time is best classified as \u201crefining and checking our thinking\u201d rather than simply \u201cmaking our thinking public.\u201d</p><p>Second, transparency continues to be important for our credibility. This isn\u2019t because all of our readers check all of our claims (in fact, we doubt that any of our readers check the majority of our claims). Rather, it\u2019s because people are able to <i>spot-check</i> our reasoning. Our blog generally tries to summarize the big picture of why our priorities and recommendations are what they are; it links to pages that go into more detail, and these pages in turn use footnotes to provide yet more detail. A reader can pick any claim that seems unlikely, or is in tension with the reader\u2019s background views, or is otherwise striking, and click through until they understand the reasoning behind the claim. This process often takes place in conversation rather than merely online - for example, see our <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/research-discussions\">research discussions</a>. For these discussions, we rely on the fact that we\u2019ve previously reached agreement with grantees on acceptable public formulations of our views and reasoning. Some readers do a lot of \u201cspot-checking,\u201d some do a little, and some merely rely on the endorsements of others. But without extensive public documentation of why we believe what we believe, we think we would have much more trouble being credible to all such people.</p><p>Finally, we believe that there is currently very little substantive public discussion of philanthropy, and that a new donor\u2019s quest to learn about good giving is unnecessarily difficult. Work on the <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/history-of-philanthropy\">history of philanthropy</a> is sparse, and doing new work in this area is challenging. Intellectuals tend to focus their thoughts and discussions on questions about public policy rather than philanthropy, making it hard to find good sources of ideas and arguments; we believe this is at least partly because of the dearth of public information about philanthropy.</p><p>We don\u2019t think philanthropic transparency is easy, and we certainly don\u2019t believe it\u2019s something that foundations can jump into overnight. We don\u2019t think it necessarily makes sense for all philanthropic organizations to put as much effort into transparency as we do. Rather, we see transparency as one of the core areas in which we are trying to experiment, innovate, and challenge the status quo.</p><p>In doing so, we hope to continue refining the processes necessary to achieve transparency, encouraging future (as well as present) foundations to adopt them, and making it easier for future organizations to be transparent than it currently is for us, so that one day there will be rich and abundant information available about how to give well.</p><p>Our ultimate goal is to do as much good as possible, and if we ever believe we might accomplish this better by dropping the emphasis on transparency, we will give serious consideration to the possibility. But at this time, the chance to promote philanthropic transparency is a major part of the case for GiveWell\u2019s future impact, and we plan to retain transparency as a costly but essential goal.</p>", "user": {"username": "HoldenKarnofsky"}}, {"_id": "S5eQJ4Rg3xxPNAnFN", "title": "Your Good Deeds 2014 Thread", "postedAt": "2014-09-30T03:25:17.885Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>Inspired by Lesswrong&apos;s Bragging Thread, this is a place to show off, to display with pride all the great things you&apos;ve done for the world and for others.

But one thing I&apos;ve discovered while doing my own career planning is that the difference between <em>opportunities</em> in a single field seems to matter just as much as the difference between fields. Opportunity-level analysis of job prospects is a great complement to looking at field-level overviews, and I think it can significantly improve career decisions.</p>\n<p>As a case study, consider someone deciding between software engineering and academic mathematics. Looking at the typical person going into these fields, software engineering seems like a much more desirable choice from an EA perspective. As an industry, software pays better, is far less competitive, has more opportunities to do directly impactful work, and grants more career capital for the same level of ability. So you&apos;d probably advise most people to pick software engineering over math academia.</p>\n<p>But looking only at the typical cases throws away a lot of information. The average opportunity for a math degree isn&apos;t necessarily the opportunity you&apos;re most likely to take. I know a number of academic mathematicians with EA tendencies, and most of them help run <a href=\"http://sparc-camp.org/\">SPARC</a>, a CFAR-funded summer program that introduces mathematically talented high-schoolers to a bunch of ideas that includes many EA-related ones. (For various reasons, it seems to me that SPARC probably wouldn&apos;t have succeeded without some academic mathematicians on board.) I think SPARC is an extremely good idea and would be pretty sad if its instructors had all gone into software development instead. In other words, it&apos;s not just important what the <em>average</em> opportunity in a field is like, but also the opportunities that <em>you in particular</em> are likely to be able to find.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the quality of which individual opportunities are available in a given field seems to vary wildly, and randomly, from person to person. For instance, when I was looking around for software jobs last year, the job that I took looked easily twice as good as my next-best alternative. Someone with similar skills to me but who wasn&apos;t as lucky while looking for software jobs might not have found it--if so, they would probably have found better opportunities in a completely different field. Similarly, a number of my friends applied for academic research positions, and I&apos;ve repeatedly seen one person find opportunities that seem much better than another person with virtually the same aptitudes.</p>\n<p>All this means that basing your career decision purely on field-level analysis seems likely to miss some potentially great career paths. To sum up, here are some pieces of career choice advice that I think are currently underrated:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>When finding a job, it&apos;s worth looking very hard for better opportunities.</strong> If there&apos;s a large random component to your available opportunities, then simply looking at a <em>larger</em> sample of opportunities is likely to surface <em>better</em> ones. To find my current job, I not only asked all my friends if they knew companies that would be good opportunities--I asked some of their friends and their friends&apos; friends too. It was only at the third degree out that I found the place I ended up working.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>If you&apos;re an unusually good fit for a field that isn&apos;t big with the EA crowd, look into it anyway.</strong> Even if the average opportunity in a field doesn&apos;t look that great, being really awesome at something tends to bring up cool opportunities almost regardless of what the thing is. Just like the mathematicians were able to start SPARC, or like Toby Ord and Will MacAskill have used their academic positions well, there seem to be a lot of benefits to excelling in almost any field.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Skills that expand the set of possible opportunities for you are extra-valuable.</strong> For instance, in college, I might have been better-served by taking fewer super-advanced math classes and more classes that would give me enough grounding in other fields to add some value in them. There&apos;s a balance to be struck here--it wouldn&apos;t be helpful to be a total dilettante, so it&apos;s probably better to branch out to neighboring fields than something different altogether. For instance, as a math and computer science major I probably wouldn&apos;t have gotten very much out of taking a couple journalism classes, but I might have tried out robotics, computational biology, or economics.</p>\n</li>\n</ul></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Ben_Kuhn"}}, {"_id": "QRQkj2bXDL4JBbKE3", "title": "Brainstorming thread: ideas for large EA funders", "postedAt": "2014-09-28T19:15:59.373Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>Alexander Gordon-Brown asked this question on the Facebook group:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Not-so-hypothetical question*: If you acquired a large sum of money**, what would you do with it?</p>\n<p>In the name of epistemic modesty, I want to start getting opinions on this.

So I may have something valuable to share with EA&#x2019;s on media distortion. When young I was interviewed in school with some of the other kids on a few occasions. Sometimes we&#x2019;d be interviewed because the school had a different methodology, sometimes because they needed good students, the reasons were variegated, but one thing remained constant. I&#x2019;d notice that the TV show would come to the school already knowing exactly what they wanted us to say. They&#x2019;d basically tell the teacher what he should inquire us about or lecture about, and the teacher would do so. Later they would interview us with questions hardly related to the class they were supposed to be covering, and even these questions would later be cut into a few seconds of something they already knew to begin with. I noticed that even the news part of TV was not news back then, it was pre-arranged fake reality.</p>\n<p>As an arrogant young teenager, at age 14, I refused giving further interviews and I&#x2019;d leave class if it was being filmed for some reason.</p>\n<p>Sometimes though, you want to be filmed for some ulterior purpose. This happened to me a few years ago when a movie director and producer came to me asking whether I would think it is a good idea that she made a documentary about me. More specifically, a documentary about the fact that I wanted to be cryopreserved when I died, &#x201C;Diego Wants to Live Forever&#x201D;. I was shocked and felt unsure about it. I sat down and told her &#x201C;I can only decide later on&#x201D;. So I asked people what they would do on <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/6v0/if_your_cryonicism_would_be_movie_topic_would_you/\"><span>LessWrong</span></a>, the World&#x2019;s largest rationality blog.</p>\n<p>I didn&#x2019;t want to be filmed for filming&#x2019;s sake. But there were ideas I could promote through the film: discussion of the Technological Singularity, Transhumanism, Immortalism, all topics unheard of in my native Brazil. Slowly those could be turned into discussion of GWWC and other effective altruist organizations as well, later. So all things considered I choose for it. The movie is yet to be released since it grew from a 15 to a 60 minutes documentary. The one thing I kept in mind throughout is that if my goal was to self promote, to promote my image, the movie would be a terrrible way to do so, since being the sole cryonicist in a christian country makes you look completely insane, not fashionable and interesting. If I wanted to promote those ideas, I&#x2019;d pay a price in my image but attracting new interested people to those memes that surround cryonics (not to cryonics itself, I have no interest in promoting it) seemed to be worthy. If someone wants to interview you or film you, always consider it a personal image sacrifice for a cause, and see if the cause is worthy enough. You&#x2019;ll never be depicted as you&#x2019;d like to be. If you are not the writer, then the goal of the media is not your goal, check trade-offs carefully.</p>\n<p>After that I was featured on a TED talk. TED is libertarian media so they actually let you do what you came to do, and help you improve. The purpose of the TED@ event was to select people for TED Global 2013. No one from my country got selected, but that didn&#x2019;t matter, because the topic on which I spoke, Effective Altruism, got selected. TED curators are smart, and they had no reason to pick me over anyone to talk on TED Global about Effective Altruism, they did what they should and invited Peter Singer to speak on behalf of the movement. Some media can really help you achieve your goals, specially if your goals don&#x2019;t mind whether you are present or not, nearly always the case with Effective Altruism. If the media that wants you is TED like, go for it and don&#x2019;t worry, they are there to help you.</p>\n<p>Later on were my 15 seconds of fame. This time I knew the distortion would be drastic, uncanny, absurd. The world&apos;s second largest TV network, (Globo, wanted to interview me for their most-viewed Sunday show. At the same time, Record, a smaller TV network, was going to broadcast their own interview with me. Basically, 40 million people would see me on TV. This is a massive amount of people, and I knew nothing I said could be immune from distortion, you don&#x2019;t get to be the second worldwide without some manipulation skills. The interview was again related to the one thing I don&#x2019;t want to get people&#x2019;s attention to, cryonics. A man&#x2019;s body was being held in the country due to a legal fight between sisters, since he wanted to be cryopreserved and only the daughter who lived with him wanted to send him to Cryonics Institute. That is what the media wants, they want to see half sisters fighting over a dead frozen body, that&#x2019;s what gets most eyeballs, and I was a side dish given I&#x2019;m the only Brazilian actually signed up for cryonics.</p>\n<p>Not long before I was contacted to provide the interview, I had founded the Effective Altruism and Transhumanism promoting institute, <a href=\"http://www.ierfh.org/\">http://www.ierfh.org</a>, we were growing and producing a lot. Our purpose was broadcasting, and there would never be a chance of broadcasting the right things for 40 million people. The question in my mind was, was it worth it to broadcast the wrong things?</p>\n<p>I decided in favor of it. I tried to negotiate with the reporters so that my name would appear as &#x201C;IERFH&#x2019;s director&#x201D; somehow. Something, a tiny tiny thing, that could connect that whole tragic comedy they wanted to broadcast as news to my actually serious work related to things I actually cared about. Of course this was to no avail. The major network displayed my name and title in the specific manner they had promised not to before the interview (what am I going to do, sue a company worth tens of billions?) and the other network didn&#x2019;t do what I asked, but at least also not the exact opposite.</p>\n<p>I had done my homework, I wrote a piece on cryonics connecting it to Transhumanism to attract those who googled about me or cryonics or both. The bridge was there. We paid Google ads to show up on top on Google for a few days. If there were similar minds we would attract them to talk to us and collaborate.</p>\n<p>What I learned from my experience is that 40 million is a massive number of people. It is so massive that though I appeared for a very short time in one channel, and none of the links that I wanted them to provide were there, dozens of people came to me or to us in the next few days. Few had something to offer or knew what they were talking about, but it has shown me the power of big numbers. When people say no press is bad press, it&#x2019;s because when you have massive numbers, there will be some viewers on the most favourable end of the bell curve who can help you. If the press is big enough, I recommend you do it, regardless of distortion. It&#x2019;s those who see through that matter most.</p>\n<p>But for most press related matters, the numbers are more mundane, in the low thousands, and the costs and benefits are more comparable. Sometimes it is better not to do it. The recent coverage of effective altruism by Rhys Southan (with a distorted title, but keep in mind not even your interviewer has complete control over his writing), is a good case in point. I invite you to use it as proxy for how much you are willing to be distorted. Here are the parts of his article that mention my name:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>From this point of view, the importance of most individual works of art would have to be negligible compared with, say, deworming 1,000 children. An idea often paraphrased in EA circles is that it doesn&#x2019;t matter who does something &#x2013; what matters is that it gets done. And though artists often pride themselves on the uniqueness of their individuality, it doesn&#x2019;t follow that they have something uniquely valuable to offer society. On the contrary, says Diego Caleiro, director of the Brazil-based Institute for Ethics, Rationality and the Future of Humanity, most of them are &#x2018;counterfactually replaceable&#x2019;: one artist is as pretty much as useful as the next. And of course, the supply is plentiful.</p>\n<p>&#x2018;We&#x2019;re actually very stacked out with people who have good mathematic skills, good philosophy skills,&#x2019; Robert Wiblin, executive director of the Centre for Effective Altruism, told me. &#x2018;I would really love to have some artists. We really need visual designers. It would be great to have people think about how Effective Altruism could be promoted through art.&#x2019; Aesthetic mavericks who anticipate long wilderness years of rejection and struggle, however, would seem to have little to contribute to the cause. Perhaps they should think about ditching their dreams for what Caleiro calls &#x2018;an area with higher expected returns&#x2019;.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And the next paragraphs, about a 1/4 of the whole written interview, are the content from which he drew those above (the rest was simply discarded), I don&#x2019;t want you to assume that I found his representation of me very degrading or very uplifting. I want you to see for what it actually is, so you can judge for yourself whether you would do an interview if you were in my place. And since our cluster of ideas, like transhumanism and effective altruism are becoming more mainstream by the day, it may not be long before you may have to face similar choices to those I did. Here it is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>When I was originally going to write an article about effective altruism, it was going to be about earning to give. My one hesitation was that I felt like someone else could easily write a similar article about earning to give, and I worried that made my &#x201C;replaceability&#x201D; very high. (And it turns out it was &#x2014; someone had already written such an article.) Do you find yourself applying the concept of &#x201C;replaceability&#x201D; to other aspects of your life? Like could you consider the replaceability of someone you&#x2019;re dating and the marginal improvement of happiness they bring to your life compared to someone else you could be dating?</em></p>\n<p>That is a great question because Love, as very few things in life, is exactly the kind of emotion in which you can&#x2019;t apply the logic or replaceability, or as we philosophers call it, counterfactuals. A great part of what love is is valuing a relationship. A specific one relationship that is built over time. Most songs about love, as Marvin Minsky reminds us, are about how the loved one could become anything, even a dumb psycho crazy nutcrack, and we would still love them. There are things that counterfactual reasoning can&#x2019;t buy. For all others, there is effective altruism.</p>\n<p><em>I suspect artists will tend to resist the effective altruism idea: there seems to be no place for them within EA, unless they happen to already be very successful, in which case they can earn to give. Do aspiring artists who want to do art full time pretty much have to give up that dream and change courses if they want to become effective altruists?</em></p>\n<p>Artists are fighting in red markets. The things they make dispute people&#x2019;s attention, and there are way more things available to pay attention to then there is attention to be given. Nearly all artists are counterfactually replaceable. This is why you feel they have no space within the EA movement. What I find interesting is that most of the early effective altruists come from a philosophy background, and the exact same is true of philosophy. Nearly no one reads academic publications by philosophers, and the area is so disputed it is hardly the case that anyone who left the profession would leave a significant blank behind that no one else could fulfill. Even then the EA movement thrives among philosophers, we should expect that over time, artists will find similar unusual paths to either conciliate their interests, or else shift their perspectives.</p>\n<p><em>And related to the previous question, one thing that effective altruism does is put things in perspective, and artists and other creators of various sorts won&#x2019;t like the perspective EA provides: by judging actions based on how much they improve well-being and decrease harm, the works of art, comedy routines and so on that people create turn out not to be that important after all. Devoting years of your life to writing a novel, for instance &#x2014; while many see this as noble in some way &#x2014; seems to be a horribly inefficient way to make a positive difference. Is there a way to reconcile effective altruism with artists&#x2019; beliefs that their creations are worthwhile contributions?</em></p>\n<p>The short answer is no. Something will have to give, either effective altruist artists shift their art to promote altruism, like some friends of mine are doing here in S&#xE3;o Paulo, or they abandon the artistic field. Art is a noble pursuit, and it should always be the case that a small subset of humanity is pursuing artistic expression and interacting with the world in that way. But I don&#x2019;t think it will ever be the case that this subset will become so small that it would actually be worth it, all things considered, to choose to become a novelist instead of an effective altruist in some other area with higher expected returns. Not because the value of art is any less than people believe it is, but just because it is infinitely easier to understand the value of art, than to understand the value of saving the lives of hundreds of people who live across the ocean, or across the century. When I say it explicitly it may not seem that way, but hundreds of millions of people are able to see the value of art, and only very few, less than one in a million, if you consider the entire world, have already understood how much good they can create by being as altruistic as possible.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This is it, make your decisions accordingly and keep in mind that the media is part of reality, in a sense, of nature, it is not good or bad intrinsically.

There's Holden Karnofsky's post on <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/08/20/excited-altruism/\">excited altruism</a>, but it doesn't really go into the details of <em>why</em>&nbsp;effective altruism is so exciting. So let me try to fix that.</p>\n<p>Growing up, it felt like the message I got from society was: one person just can't do much. The problems in the world are huge and structural, and naive reformers will eventually just become disillusioned and burn out. We can try to make small efforts in our personal lives, but they're tiny and won't scale.</p>\n<p>Effective altruism says that this doesn't need to be true! Yes, some of the problems are huge and structural, but that doesn't mean that individuals can't have a big impact. The average person working in an ordinary job can potentially save several lives a year, just by donating a <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/what-you-can-achieve\">measly 10% of their income</a> and doing literally <em>nothing</em> else altruistic! That would already be amazing by itself.</p>\n<p>But it doesn't end there. Effective altruism says that, if you focus on the right career, you can have an even bigger impact! And the careers don't even need to be exotic, demanding ones that only a few select ones can do (even if some of them are). Some of the <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/research/top-careers/\">top potential careers</a> that 80,000 hours has identified so far include thing as diverse as being an academic, civil servant, journalist, marketer, politician, or software engineer, among others. Not only that, they also emphasize <em>finding your fit</em>. To have a big impact on the world, you don't need to shoehorn yourself into a role that doesn't suit you and that you hate - in fact you're explicitly <em>encouraged</em> to find an high-impact career that <em>fits you personally</em>.</p>\n<p>Analytic? Maybe consider research, in one form or another. Want to mostly support the cause from the side, not thinking about things too much? Let the existing charity evaluation organizations guide who you donate to and don't worry about the rest. Or help out other effective altruists. People person? Plenty of ways you could have an impact. There's always <em>something</em> you can do - and still be effective. It's not about needing to be superhuman, it's about doing the best that you can, <em>given your personality, talents and interests</em>.</p>\n<p>Best of all? This isn't just some fuzzy feelgood thing where you're taking things on faith. People in the community are constantly debating these things, looking for ways to improve and to become even better at doing good. If you have even the slightest inclination, you're encouraged to participate and refine the ideas. If you spot a crucial flaw in someone else's argument, or suggest a critical improvement, it may impact the effectiveness of all the other effective altruists who are doing or thinking about doing something related.</p>\n<p>Here's an extra bonus. At the moment, the core of effective altruism is formed of smart, driven, and caring people from all around the world. When you become an effective altruist and start participating, you are joining a community of some of the most interesting people on Earth.</p>\n<p>A lot of people feel like life is meaningless, and that it doesn't offer any purpose that would feel worth pursuing. I've felt like that at times, too. But it's hard to find a purpose whose idea would be more compelling, exciting, or rewarding than that of effective altruism.</p>\n<p><i>This work is licensed under a <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License</a></i></p>\n", "user": {"username": "Kaj_Sotala"}}, {"_id": "TqGEZwT2BZAdQ6TcP", "title": "How to Make Your Article Have Consistent Formatting", "postedAt": "2014-09-25T15:23:55.889Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>Although the text editor of the Effective Altruism Forum works well for most users, occasionally people have problems with text formatting.</p>\n<p>The main trick is to be careful of text that you have pasted in from another document.

Both are solidly convinced that this is not an approach that benefits the world, let alone the best approach for a Harvard Law graduate. And both are convinced the arguments are obviously flawed:</p>\n<blockquote><em>Mystal:</em> It&apos;s pretty stupid. It&apos;s not absurd enough to achieve Jonathan Swift levels of parody, nor is it thought through enough to be taken seriously.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><em>Atri:</em> I am not responding to this article because I think the arguments merit the time and energy I will spend writing this up.</blockquote>\n<p>The main issue seems to be that both responders have dismissed the possibility that someone going into corporate law would actually donate 25% of their salary. This turns the &quot;earn money and give a lot of it away&quot; proposal into &quot;earn money and spend it on yourself,&quot; and it&apos;s not surprising that they wouldn&apos;t have much respect for someone arguing that you should do this:</p>\n<blockquote><em>Atri:</em> I can bet that almost no one going into corporate law next year is donating 30% of their post-tax income to charity.</blockquote>\n<blockquote><em>Mystal:</em> To even get into this argument, you have to accept the premise that there is any Biglaw associate, anywhere, who is going to give away 25% of their post-tax salary. And you would have to be really dumb to accept that premise. It&apos;s a dumb premise, even if you assume that Biglaw associates are desperate to make charitable contributions to the world. Between rent and student loan payments, giving 25% away would make it a struggle for most associates to pay all their other bills. People don&apos;t bill 60 hours a week working for the greater good of corporate clients to be functionally poor.</blockquote>\n<p>Leaving aside that I know several people in corporate law who are earning to give, along with others in finance, teaching, software development, and other professions, they&apos;re making the wrong comparison. They&apos;re saying &quot;considering the people I know who are going into corporate law, I can&apos;t imagine them starting to donate 25% of their income to charity&quot;. And they may well be right! The article isn&apos;t aimed at people who&apos;ve already decided to go into corporate law, however, it&apos;s aimed at people who want to maximize the good they do. Consider each of the jobs Barlow describes relative to going into corporate law and keeping all the money. Each one has an amount of money you&apos;re passing up in order to do good, and an amount you keep:</p>\n<table>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<th>Job</th><th>Income Kept</th><th>Income Forgone</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Corporate Law, donating 25%</td>\n<td>$75k</td>\n<td>$25k</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Public Interest</td>\n<td>$33k</td>\n<td>$67k</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Government</td>\n<td>$40k</td>\n<td>$60k</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Academia</td>\n<td>$26k</td>\n<td>$74k</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>Deciding to go into government law, for example, is like deciding to take a $100k job and donate everything above $40k. If Barlow&apos;s salary estimates are reasonable, someone going into corporate law and donating 25% has much more income left over for rent, student loan payments, and other expenses than someone choosing any of these other routes. Someone with an income of $75k is hardly &quot;functionally poor.&quot;</p>\n<p>After writing off the idea that people might donate 25% of their income (let alone <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/giving-half\">50%</a>) as unrealistic the responding authors then seem to just assume that Barlow actually meant a much lower number. For example:</p>\n<blockquote><em>Mystal:</em> I can just imagine a Big Phrama lawyer who spends six days a week to protect the company&apos;s patent monopoly on life-saving drugs, then cuts a check for $6 for a bug net and thinks he&apos;s done his good deed for the month.</blockquote>\n<p>Yes, of course that&apos;s wrong. Don&apos;t just donate $6/month! Barlow is proposing giving 25% of an $100k salary, or $2k/month. But this does get us into their second objection, which is more substantive: corporate law does harm:</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<blockquote><em>Atri:</em> I say this because you are not choosing to go into neutral, apolitical, work. None of us working in the legal profession are. Your firm, Bill, has represented JPMorgan Chase, a bank that backed thousands of predatory and racist loans and helped create the foreclosure crisis. Your firm also (according to its website) &quot;routinely defends companies faced with serious products liability and consumer fraud claims ... involving thousands of claimants.&quot; For those thousands of claimants who were first harmed by faulty products, and then denied any remedy, your charity may be less than appreciated.</blockquote>\n<p>Going into corporate law means you should expect to be involved in a range of work, some of it harmful and some of it helpful. All of these situations could be either: patent monopolies are how we&apos;ve ended up funding most of our drug research but loosening them up in some cases could be good; product liability and consumer fraud claims can go either way depending on the facts of the situation. But let&apos;s apply a &quot;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2013/07/show-me-the-harm/\">show me the harm</a>&quot; style argument. There are <a href=\"http://www.bls.gov/ooh/legal/lawyers.htm\">760k</a> lawyers in the US, and say half of them work in the private sector. That&apos;s 390k people. If you expect that someone going into corporate law while donating an amount that saves ~10 lives a year is harmful, then the net harm of corporate lawyers must more than 3.9M deaths a year. This is <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2013/07/show-me-the-harm/#fn:2\">14%</a> of total worldwide deaths, and this doesn&apos;t include corporate lawyers in other countries. This is enough deaths that it seems pretty clear donating 25% does far more good than the harm you could plausibly be doing as a lawyer.</p>\n<p>But what really worries me is when people start going down the path of &quot;money doesn&apos;t matter&quot;:</p>\n<blockquote><em>Mystal:</em> People who are actually concerned about the public interest don&apos;t think that way. They don&apos;t think that currency is the only tender that can or should be offered up in an effort to make things better. They resist the endless attempts to commodify every action or inaction in this country with dollars and cents. The author estimates that you could save 150 lives a year by donating $25,000 to anti-malarial bug nets. That&apos;s a great use of your spare cash, but you&apos;ve got nothing on the people who spend their <em>time</em> helping to distribute those bug nets, or even the people who teach proper bug net use.</blockquote>\n<p>This is wrong in a poisonous harmful way, more wrong than everything else in the piece. Altruism isn&apos;t <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/altruism-isnt-about-sacrifice\">about sacrifice</a>, it&apos;s not about whether you help via time, money, or materials, it&apos;s about having a positive impact on the people you&apos;re trying to help. If spending time distributing nets helps more people than spending time earning money to help fund a local organization that distributes nets then you should do that, but if it&apos;s the other way then you should earn the money and donate it instead. There&apos;s nothing categorically better about volunteering over other other ways of helping, and to say otherwise is to make giving about the donor instead of the people who really matter.</p>\n<p>So how would I object to Barlow&apos;s article? His estimate of the cost to save a life is too low, but even at a more likely $2500/life, donating 25% would be saving 10 lives a year. His dismissals of the value of government, academic, and public interest work are also too strong: while it&apos;s very hard to estimate the benefit of a career in, say, academia, I wouldn&apos;t write it off entirely. Ten deaths a year [1] is a steep opportunity cost to balance, but dramatic legal process improvements could probably have a benefit larger than that. So it still might be worth going into one of the other branches of law if you had a strong reason to believe your particular job would have very large benefits [2]. But overall I wouldn&apos;t object at all: the simple math of earning to give is very powerful.</p>\n<p><br> <small><em>I also posted this <a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/p/lawyering-to-give\">on my blog</a>.<em></em></em></small> <br><br> [1] In fact it&apos;s more like 30, because the comparison for &quot;go into academia and earn $26k&quot; should be &quot;go into corporate law and donate all but $26k.&quot;</p>\n<p>[2] After accounting for <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2012/03/the-replaceability-effect-working-in-unethical-industries-part-1/\">replaceabilty</a>.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Jeff_Kaufman"}}, {"_id": "73hurnFXE9BHWC6hR", "title": "Learning From Less Wrong: Special Threads, and Making This Forum More Useful", "postedAt": "2014-09-24T10:59:20.874Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>This post was originally intended as a comment on a discussion about how we shall make use of this forum.

Less Wrong users organize themselves to post these threads on their regularly timed schedule(s), and we could do the same. I personally volunteer to post the periodic threads I&apos;ve suggested above. I&apos;ll start posting these in October, one per week, and repeat the pattern every (other) month.</p>\n<p>Additionally, Less Wrong users spontaneously created threads which became useful repositories of information.&#xA0;</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/h2m/solved_problems_repository/\">Solved Problems Repository</a></strong>: this is a thread for &apos;solved&apos; problems in instrumental rationality. Since instrumental rationality is useful advice for everyone, I recommend checking out that thread on Less Wrong itself. Anyway, we could have such a resource on this forum specific to effective altruism. For example, there could be a resources page for dealing with tax-deductible donations, launching a non-profit organization, etc., for each of the different countries effective altruists are from.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><strong><a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/hhl/useful_concepts_repository/\">Useful Concepts Repository</a></strong>: a resource for crystallized ideas, and frames of reference, to catch up to speed on what others mean.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/gx5/boring_advice_repository/\"><strong>Helpful Life Advice</strong></a>: this is called something else on Less Wrong, but I figure we can call it &apos;Helpful Life Advice&apos; here because effective altruism is so much more personal than other activities.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/i4l/useful_questions_repository/\"><strong>Useful Questions Repository</strong></a>: questions that are good, and useful, to keep in mind as an effective altruist.

Forgive me if this has already been discussed in depth somewhere, and I just missed it.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Effective Altruists should move to cities with a high cost of living.</strong></p>\n<p><strong></strong><br>I have seen discussions about migrating in very specific instances (e.g. <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2014/06/increasing-your-earnings-as-a-doctor/\">Should doctors move to a different country</a>? <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2012/02/software-engineering-britain-vs-silicon-valley/\">Should engineers move to Silicon Valley</a>?), but I don&apos;t think I&apos;ve seen people ask whether it&#x2019;s good in general to migrate to a city with high cost of living.</p>\n<p><strong>Donate More. </strong></p>\n<p>If your salary was constant, it would obviously be better to pay lower rent. However, cities with a high cost of living tend to have similarly high salaries (with exceptions). A job that pays $50k in Houston would pay <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/calculator/pf/cost-of-living/\">$111k in Manhattan</a>, if the company gave cost of living adjustments. If all your money is going towards your living expenses then this wouldn&apos;t be important, but if you are donating a set percentage of your income (or paying off student debt, or saving for retirement), this doubles the amount you give (or pay off, or save). &#xA0;Even if you&#x2019;re not donating a set percentage of your income, if your cost of living is less than most others in your job, then you will still end up ahead.</p>\n<p><strong>Be Green.</strong></p>\n<p>If global warming is something you care about, another factor is that big cities are significantly greener than elsewhere. Despite our ideas of big cities being pollution spewers, the high population density (a bunch of people live in a single apartment building, instead of a single family sprawled out in a large suburban home) and availability of public transportation make cities have significantly less greenhouse gas per capita. It seems like the cities with the highest cost of living do the best, which makes sense because there is a strong causal correlation between high rents, people living in small spaces, people living close together, there being good public transportation or walking availability, etc. In the US, New York and San Francisco do noticeably better than other cities.</p>\n<p><span> <span> </span><span>Greenhouse Gas Emissions Per Capita for select US cities </span>(source: <a href=\"http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTUWM/Resources/GHG_Index_Mar_9_2011.pdf\">World Bank</a>): </span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#xA0;New York City: <span> <span> </span></span>7.9 &#xA0;</li>\n<li><span> </span>San Francisco:<span> <span> </span></span>10.1 &#xA0;</li>\n<li><span> </span>Seattle:<span> <span> </span></span>14.1 &#xA0;&lt;-- known for &quot;green&quot; culture &#xA0;</li>\n<li>&#xA0;Menlo Park: &#xA0; &#xA0; &#xA0;<span> </span>16.4 &#xA0;</li>\n<li><span> </span>US Overall Average:<span> <span> </span></span>23.6 &#xA0;</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><strong>Build a Movement.</strong></p>\n<p>If building the effective altruism movement is something you care about, then you will probably also have a better opportunity to do that in a larger city, even if that requires paying higher costs of living. For instance, the two largest cities for effective altruism, San Francisco and Oxford both have high costs of living but effective altruists there can reap some social and other benefits.</p>\n<p>So if you can work remotely or your salary is fixed, it&#x2019;s probably good to be where living costs are low but for most effective altruists, it seems like the opposite might be the case.</p>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><strong>My questions are this:&#xA0;</strong></div>\n<p>1. Do most jobs actually account for cost of living in their salary offers, so that we can offer this as generalized advice (though of course there may be exceptions)?</p>\n<p>2. Are the cost of living salary adjustments not as big as the actual cost of living differences? So that the job might pay slightly more in a big city, but not a full adjustment more?</p>\n<p>3. Are there other factors I&apos;m not thinking of which would make this NOT be good advice?</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p><em>Acknowledgements: I&apos;d like to thank Ryan Carey and Lincoln Quirk for editing, adding, proof reading, discussing, and being generally helpful.

Some think we can do the most good by alleviating poverty in the developing world; some think it&#x2019;s best to focus on animal suffering; others again think we should focus on helping future generations; and some argue that the best route to any of these is to invest in the development of the EA movement itself.</p>\n<p>Given that we agree on so many principles, this much disagreement might seem surprising. And it raises a key question: what should we do about it?</p>\n<h2>Are some causes better than others?</h2>\n<p>Some differences of opinion over which cause to support may come down to a difference in values. For example, some people think we should give similar weight to the welfare of future generations as we give to our own, and others think we should not.</p>\n<p>But more disagreements arise from differences of opinion about matters of fact. These are often very uncertain matters, such as which of two interventions will most improve the world in the long run. They can also include differences of opinion about how we should weigh proven against speculative interventions, an ultimately empirical but unresolved question.</p>\n<p>Suppose Alice and Bob agree on their values, but Alice thinks the best way to fulfil their values is to try to avoid extinction, whereas Bob thinks it&#x2019;s better to help people in poverty today. Since they agree on values, there is a correct answer about which cause provides the most value for marginal resources -- and this is unlikely to change with the resources of two people. In this sense some causes are better than others.</p>\n<p>It doesn&#x2019;t necessarily follow that they should both support the same cause. Some individual choices may come down to the availability of specialist knowledge or opportunities. But it is suggestive. At least some of the difference in opinions about the best cause likely comes down to ignorance, stubbornness, or bias.</p>\n<h2>Should we try to persuade others to switch causes?</h2>\n<p>So setting aside value differences and specialisation, one cause is probably best at the margin. For those who believe they support that cause (presumably most people), this seems to present a strong argument for trying to persuade others towards supporting it too. It could provide a substantial increase in the value from their altruistic efforts.</p>\n<p>There is value from the act of trying to persuade others as well as from success. Having a dialogue about the virtues of different options fosters truth-seeking and the idea that we may not be correct in our current views.</p>\n<p>However, there are also reasons not to push too hard to persuade others. The simplest is epistemic modesty. If other smart, well-meaning, and well-informed people are reaching different conclusions from us, we shouldn&#x2019;t be too confident that we&#x2019;re the ones who are right.</p>\n<p>Even when do think we&#x2019;re right, in some circumstances <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/9z/the_epistemic_prisoners_dilemma/\">we can achieve more collectively by cooperating with people with whom we have disagreements of fact</a>. We should preserve good relations with each other. In general, <a href=\"/ea/5p/keeping_the_effective_altruist_movement_welcoming/welcoming/\">it&#x2019;s worthwhile for effective altruists to be nice</a>. Trying too hard to persuade others risks an acrimonious atmosphere which would be detrimental to the reputation of the whole movement, and its ability to collaborate and grow.</p>\n<p>And while a single cause is probably best at the margin, there&#x2019;s value for the movement as a whole in supporting a diverse portfolio of causes. Diminishing marginal returns will hardly matter for already-large causes like global health, but could have an effect for smaller ones such as movement growth. By spreading out, we can learn more and learn faster, and are less liable to fall into confirmation bias. By visibly supporting several causes, we also gain a way to enter discussions with people whose prior judgements lean towards some particular causes. It helps to demonstrate our openness to ideas and evidence, where if we all rallied around a single thing early in the growth of the movement we might more easily be pigeon-holed as the people who care about that thing.</p>\n<h2>Conclusions</h2>\n<p>A better understanding of which causes help most is really useful. So we need to continue to discuss this, sharing insights and information. But cause prioritisation isn&#x2019;t a competition between the people supporting different causes where there will be winners and losers. Rather it&#x2019;s a shared endeavour to uncover important truths about the world, where progress means we win collectively.</p>\n<p>So I&#x2019;ll discuss the merits of different causes with people, and I&#x2019;ll try gently to persuade them of what seems best to me. But I won&#x2019;t judge or think poorly of others simply because they don&#x2019;t share my beliefs. I&#x2019;ll take suggestions they make seriously, and be just as happy to be persuaded that I&#x2019;m wrong.</p>\n<address>Acknowledgements: thanks to Ryan Carey, Jess Whittlestone, and Rob Wiblin for comments and suggestions on drafts of this essay.</address></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Owen_Cotton-Barratt"}}, {"_id": "7Qb4LRoyTrwkArKzc", "title": "Meetup : Sydney Meetup", "postedAt": "2014-09-23T03:23:07.580Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><h2>Discussion article for the meetup : <a href=\"/meetups/i\">Sydney Meetup</a></h2>\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHEN:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>05 October 2014 01:00:00PM (+1000)</span><br>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHERE:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>Hyde Park, Sydney</span>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t  </div><!-- .meta -->\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t    <div><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/events/363494607137239/?source=1\">https://www.facebook.com/events/363494607137239/?source=1</a></p></div>\n\t\t  </div><!-- .content -->\n\t\t<h2>Discussion article for the meetup : <a href=\"/meetups/i\">Sydney Meetup</a></h2></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Geordie_Lucas"}}, {"_id": "QHQvEofSFtAvdqfPg", "title": "Meetup : Effective Altruism Brisbane", "postedAt": "2014-09-22T22:25:18.795Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><h2>Discussion article for the meetup : <a href=\"/meetups/h\">Effective Altruism Brisbane</a></h2>\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHEN:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>02 October 2014 05:00:00PM (+1000)</span><br>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHERE:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>Brisbane, Australia</span>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t  </div><!-- .meta -->\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t    <div><p>This is the first meetup of EAs in Brisbane.

So, I had a go at listing the key principles that guide our research.</p><p>I thought it might be interesting to the forum as a take on an epistemology for effective altruism i.e. what principles should EAs use to make judgements about which causes to support, which careers to take, which charities to donate to and so on?</p><p>I'm interested to hear your ideas on (i) which principles you disagree with (ii) which principles we've missed.</p><p>See the original page <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/about-us/credibility/research-principles/\">here</a>.</p><hr><h2>What evidence do we consider?</h2><h3>Use of scientific literature</h3><p>We place relatively high weight on what scientific literature says about a question, when applicable. If there is relevant scientific literature, we start our inquiry by doing a literature search.</p><h3>Expert common sense</h3><p>When we first encounter a question, our initial aim is normally to work out: (i) who are the relevant experts? (ii) what would they say about this question? We call what they would say \u2018expert common sense\u2019, and we think it often forms a good starting position (<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/iao/common_sense_as_a_prior/\">more</a>). We try not to deviate from expert common sense unless we have an account of why it\u2019s wrong.</p><h3>Quantification</h3><p>Which careers make the most difference can be unintuitive, since it\u2019s difficult to grasp the scale and scope of different problems, which often differ by orders of magnitude. This makes it important to attempt to quantify and model key factors when possible. The process of quantification is also often valuable for learning more about an issue, and making your reasoning transparent to others. However, we recognise that for most questions we care about, quantified models contain huge (often unknown) uncertainties, and therefore, should not be followed blindly. We always weigh the results of quantified models against their robustness compared to qualitative analysis and common sense.</p><h3>The experience of the people we coach</h3><p>We\u2019ve coached hundreds of people on career decisions and have a wider network of people we gather information from who are aligned with our mission. We place weight on their thoughts about the pros and cons of different areas.</p><h2>How do we combine evidence?</h2><h3>We strive to be Bayesian</h3><p>We attempt to explicitly clarify our prior guess on an issue, and then update in favor or out of favor based on the strength of our evidence for or against. See an example<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2012/12/how-to-judge-your-chances-of-success/\"> here</a>. This is called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_inference\">\u2018Bayesian reasoning\u2019</a>, and, although not always it adopted, seems to be regarded as best practice for decision making under high uncertainty among those who write about good decision making process.<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2014/09/what-does-good-research-look-like/#fn-16681-1\">1</a></p><h3>We use \u2018cluster thinking\u2019</h3><p>As opposed to relying on one or two strong considerations, we seek to evaluate the question from many angles, weighting each perspective according to its robustness and the importance of the consequences. We think this process provides more robust answers in the context of decision making under high uncertainty than alternatives (such as making a simple quantified model and going with the answer). This style of thinking has been supported by various groups and has several names, including&nbsp;<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2014/06/10/sequence-thinking-vs-cluster-thinking/\">\u2018cluster thinking\u2019</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/hzu/model_combination_and_adjustment/\">\u2018model combination and adjustment\u2019</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/hmb/many_weak_arguments_vs_one_relatively_strong/\">\u2018many weak arguments\u2019</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Expert-Political-Judgment-Good-Know/dp/0691128715/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1409332611&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=expert+political+judgment\">\u2018fox style\u2019 thinking</a>.</p><p>We seek to make this process transparent by listing the main perspectives we\u2019ve considered on a question. We also make regular use of structured qualitative evaluations, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/problem-framework/\">our framework</a>.</p><h3>We seek robustly good paths</h3><p>Our aim is to make good decisions. Since the future is unpredictable and full of unknown unknowns, and we\u2019re uncertain about many things, we seek actions that will turn out to be good under many future scenarios.</p><h2>Avoiding bias</h2><p>We\u2019re very aware of the potential for bias in our work, which often relies on difficult judgement calls, and have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2013/05/biases-how-they-affect-your-career-decisions-and-what-to-do-about-them/\">surveyed the literature on biases in career decisions</a>.

(transcript)", "postedAt": "2014-09-19T20:50:56.620Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>[This is an edited transcript of a talk I gave back in June. It&apos;s more heavily edited once you get to the Q&amp;A session, to be more concise and organized than the actual Q&amp;A was. Some of the information may already be somewhat out of date, though I have corrected one or two minor errors.]</p>\n<p>Hi. My name is Chris, and in addition to being a member of Giving What We Can, I am a software developer working in San Francisco. But this was not my original career path. I started out getting to college. I thought I&apos;d be pre-med, because it was for altruistic reasons. I wanted to join an organization like Doctors Without Borders and go do third world health stuff in the developing world to help people there. But this actually wasn&apos;t the best idea, in retrospect, for a couple of reasons. One of them is that I just hate memorizing anatomy and things like that.</p>\n<p>(One of the things that I&apos;m still trying to figure out about things that have happened to me in my life is do other people who actually end up going to med school have some quirk that makes memorizing anatomy easy for them, or did I just hate it more because I wasn&apos;t good at math? Sorry. I was really good at math. Math was super easy for me, and then this memorization shit, man.)</p>\n<p>From there, I went into philosophy, which was also a mistake... I don&apos;t know, I just wrote a blog post about philosophy versus programming which you can <a href=\"http://www.patheos.com/blogs/hallq/2014/06/philosophy-vs-programming/\">read</a>. I won&apos;t go on that rant here. But eventually found my way into programming and earning to give.</p>\n<p>In addition to not just being good at anatomy, the other problem with the whole be a doctor plan and join an organization like Doctors Without Borders, is that doctors are to a large extent replaceable, which may seem kind of funny to hear because we think doctors are really important.</p>\n<p>But they&apos;re replaceable in the economic sense that if you didn&apos;t do it, probably someone else would, like med school applications. Med school applications are super, super competitive. There&apos;s a shortage of doctors right now, but there&apos;s also a shortage of residencies, the first jobs you get after med school.</p>\n<p>The bottlenecks on having enough doctors in the world totally is not on enough people wanting to be doctors. It might be different for an organization like Doctors Without Borders, but I just wasn&apos;t even thinking in those terms when I was in high school applying to colleges, and then my first couple years at college. I had no idea whether the limiting factor on those organizations&apos; ability to operate, was it talented people who wanted to do that or was the limiting factor money or was the limiting factor...? I had no idea.</p>\n<p>Whereas, say you&apos;re making $100,000 a year as a software developer and you donate 20 percent of that to organizations like <a href=\"http://www.againstmalaria.com/\">AMF</a>. AMF may not be the best example, because as Tim talked about, there&apos;s <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF#Roomformorefunds\">issues with distributing money.</a> But at least back, when they had room for more funding, the estimate was that for every $2,000-odd dollars they spend, the estimate was they were saving one life.</p>\n<p>You do the math on donating 20 percent of $100,000 and you&apos;re saving eight or nine lives per year, which is really amazing. That&apos;s really hard to do and as a doctor you might see a lot of patients, but someone else would be very likely to be doing that. Whereas, with earning to give, that&apos;s not something that is replaceable in the economic sense, it&apos;s not true that if you weren&apos;t doing it, someone else would.</p>\n<p>Again, you reach some of those limits like AMF&apos;s funding issue, but even if you hit the limit on one organization&apos;s ability to receive funds, there are still other organizations out there, like GiveWell is currently recommending the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, which manages to give deworming treatments, the less sexy diseases like malaria that maybe get neglected. Neglected tropical disease, they&apos;re called.</p>\n<p>They provide these treatments for pennies on the dollar. Think, again, treating tens of thousands of people for these diseases that really suck. That wouldn&apos;t happen without your donation, which is super awesome.</p>\n<p>Whether this makes sense as a strategy for you depends a little bit on who you are. I suspect for a lot of smart, idealistic people, the odds are very, very good that this is something you should consider.</p>\n<p>Or even if you aren&apos;t super-talented, like having the talent to be a software engineer, you don&apos;t get programming. Programming is weird. Some people just get it and some people just don&apos;t. The people who do get it are super lucky.</p>\n<p>But even if you&apos;re making $30,000 a year, by global standards, that&apos;s a lot of money. Even donating 10 percent of that is a huge freaking deal from the perspective of charities that are working on Third World health.</p>\n<p>(I keep using Third World health as an example just because we know how to measure that, but potentially you could make a huge impact in other areas as well. I just keep using that as an example.)</p>\n<p>A lot of idealistically-minded people resist the idea of earning to give. I thought about doing it on my way out of philosophy grad school. I thought about going into law for that purpose. I didn&apos;t quite realize that computer programming might be an option for me, but lots of philosophy majors go into law. I thought about doing that. Didn&apos;t, partly because just being a law graduate isn&apos;t as good of a deal as it used to be. It&apos;s like medicine. There are tons and tons of people going into law and not enough entry-level jobs, etc., etc.</p>\n<p>Anyway, it&apos;s the thought of yourself directly doing good, being the guy out front, is really, really enticing for a lot of people. If you resist the idea of earning to give, you should interrogate why you&apos;re doing it. It might be right for you.</p>\n<p>I&apos;m sure people directly working on things like GiveWell, doing that direct work, can have a huge impact. But I&apos;m sure, for a lot of people in this room, you&apos;re maybe not in a position to do that kind of direct work. You should really take a hard look at earning to give as a career choice.</p>\n<p>Also, if you like the idea of the psychological feeling that you&apos;re doing something, and you want people to know that you&apos;re doing something, if you&apos;re earning to give, you are encouraged to brag about it, because the research says that if you brag it, if you tell other people you&apos;re donating to these charities, that makes them more likely to give themselves. From a pure pragmatic point of view, bragging is encouraged.&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Opinion/Commentary/2008/Jun-19/116467-give-and-tell-in-defense-of-philanthropic-graffiti.ashx#axzz3DiKHav34\">Jesus was wrong</a> about this. Don&apos;t donate anonymously.</p>\n<p>There are huge, &quot;How do you go about picking a career?&quot; and &quot;Trading off earning to give versus other things&quot; questions, but the website <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/\">80,000 Hours</a> has a ton of information on this stuff. One of the first things I would recommend doing is logging onto there.</p>\n<p>They have a lot of comparisons, case studies of people who are trying to decide what to do with their lives, different careers, both in terms of, &quot;Which career can I make more money in?&quot;, or people trying to decide, &quot;Would I be better off earning to give versus, say, going into medical research? I think I might be able to make a big impact in medical research.&quot;</p>\n<p>A lot of these cases, it&apos;s tricky to figure out, but you&apos;ll be able to see information that other people have gathered trying to figure out this sort of stuff.</p>\n<p>Also, just focus on what you&apos;re good at. Don&apos;t think so much in terms of what you want to do. Think of what can you do, which is a weird thing to figure out because on the one hand, you have to compare yourself a little bit to other people. If you&apos;re &quot;good&quot; at something that tons and tons of people are good at, and there&apos;s not enough jobs in it, that&apos;s not as useful.</p>\n<p>Then you don&apos;t have to just be good, you have be one of the best. But if you&apos;re, say, one of the people who gets programming, there just aren&apos;t enough people who get programming. That&apos;s a career you can make a lot of money in.</p>\n<p>This applies to non-earning-to-give stuff as well. If you have a talent that non-profits really need, and there aren&apos;t enough people who can do this thing that non-profits need you to do, that&apos;s important too. The economic term is &quot;comparative advantage,&quot; so sort of what you are good at compared to other people.</p>\n<p>You also can&apos;t get too hung up on comparing yourselves to other people. When I was in high school, I was super good at math. I went to national-level math meets. But then I got to these meets and saw people who were even better than I was. Then I&apos;m like, &quot;Oh, man!&quot; It&apos;s really discouraging.</p>\n<p>It was stupid for me to let myself get discouraged by that because even if I&apos;m not going to be the next Einstein, now I still have a good job as a software developer. There are enough people here that I am sure there is someone who would benefit from me plugging software development because...</p>\n<p>[Audience laughs, I have a realization]</p>\n<p>We have a lot of people who are already software developers. The thing about software development is it&apos;s a lucrative career in a similar way that law and medicine are, but word hasn&apos;t gotten out about that yet.</p>\n<p>There&apos;s still a shortage people. It hasn&apos;t been like all the smart kids have flooded into it the way that it&apos;s happened with medicine and law. It&apos;s also something that&apos;s easy to switch into once you&apos;re already out of school. That&apos;s what I did. I had no idea this was even possible two years ago. Then I heard from people like Eliezer Yudkowsky who did a <a href=\"http://hpmor.com/notes/chapter-79/\">PSA about this</a> in HPMOR.</p>\n<p><a href=\"/lukemuehlhauser.com\">Luke</a>, in his capacity as my boss when I was a researcher for MIRI told me, &quot;Hey, you should really look at this.&quot; Finally after the third time I heard someone saying, &quot;You should really look at this,&quot; I finally did. Oh my gosh, I don&apos;t actually need a computer science degree to do this.</p>\n<p>If you&apos;re on the East Coast trying to get a job on Wall Street, they care a lot about where you got your degree, what your degree is in. Where did you go to school? Did you go to Harvard or Yale? Wait, no, sorry, bye. It&apos;s not quite that bad, but it&apos;s that kind of attitude.</p>\n<p>The tech scene in the Bay Area is a lot more open minded. If you can show you can do this stuff, we will give you a job. There are people who teach themselves to get a program and get a job. There are people like me, and Buck, and Edward who do this amazing thing called <a href=\"http://www.appacademy.io/?referer=Chris+Hallquist\">App Academy</a>, which is a nine week intensive course where they teach you to program and you don&apos;t have to pay the tuition until you actually get a job. They have a really good track record of placing people. People average like $100,000 salaries, no kidding.</p>\n<p>I wrote a <a href=\"http://www.patheos.com/blogs/hallq/2014/06/so-youre-thinking-of-applying-to-app-academy/\">blog post</a> about App Academy.&#xA0;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2014/04/interview-with-buck-shlegeris-from-app-academy/\">Buck&apos;s interview</a>&#xA0;is really good. Actually, hold on. Again, projector, I actually made a page on my personal website that&apos;s&#xA0;<a href=\"http://ChrisHallquist.com/earning-to-give.html\">ChrisHallquist.com/earning-to-give.html</a>&#xA0;which has all these links. It has a link to Buck&apos;s interview. It has a link to <a href=\"http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/learn-code/\">Peter Herford&apos;s guide on learning to program</a>. It has a link to blog posts I&apos;ve written. I decided this would be a virtual handout. If I gave you a piece of paper, you wouldn&apos;t be able to click on links.</p>\n<p><strong>Q. Regarding App Academy, what if you&apos;re not a US citizen?</strong></p>\n<p>Yeah, that&apos;s a problem. We do have some students who are non-US citizens. Then they do have some issues securing visas and stuff, unfortunately.</p>\n<p><strong>Q. You were talking about the replaceability in terms of direct work versus earning to give kind of a how to go about saving lives. In the previous talk there was a bunch of people having different opinions. Should we be working on saving lives now? Should we be looking at the far future? How would you be thinking about the sort of replaceability concerns if you are accepting arguments about the far future?</strong></p>\n<p>That&apos;s a good point. It&apos;s sort of hard to answer, partly because I haven&apos;t investigated the funding situation of MIRI and FHI enough. Maybe Louie can tell you more about MIRI&apos;s funding situation and their ability to absorb more dollars. I don&apos;t know. That&apos;s something I intend to investigate in the near future, but I haven&apos;t investigated that enough. It&apos;s sort of a complicated question.</p>\n<p>Personally, from my point of view, if I were to investigate some of these, FHI, and MIRI, or whatever, and I just came to the conclusion that they didn&apos;t have a lot of room for more money, then I would just give to third world health organizations. You might believe that MIRI doesn&apos;t have room for more money, they might have room for more talent.</p>\n<p>There&apos;s a combination of what you think MIRI&apos;s funding situation is and what you think their room-for-more-talent situation is. It&apos;s complicated. You have to think about these things. I don&apos;t have the answers, but these are good considerations for you to have, is all I can say.</p>\n<p>Do we have anyone who is not just still a student, but is still a student on a traditional student track? You&apos;re going back to finish your degree, but you&apos;re making a ridiculous amount of money right now. Standard career advice for students doesn&apos;t apply. [To one audience member] You&apos;re already in computer science. You are on the true path. I don&apos;t need to give you advice.</p>\n<p>Feel free to ask me specific questions to your situation online. My email address is on the link that I will post to the Facebook group. Or you can message me on Facebook.</p>\n<p><strong>Q. As a person who is earning to give, do you plan to do anything other than being a hands-off money supplier? How do you weigh the tradeoff between focusing more on your job versus other things?</strong></p>\n<p>I&apos;m doing talks like this. I&apos;m blogging right now, and I&apos;m trying to write more blog posts that are related to effective altruism. I have to figure out what I can do. There are issues that I think are important, and yet I&apos;m not sure what can be done about them.</p>\n<p>As for how to weigh the tradeoffs, it&apos;s hard to tell. The fact that I&apos;m telling people I&apos;m doing this and making sure that the specific information I have in my head that&apos;s not yet out there gets out there, and then I reach a point of diminishing returns on that and then it&apos;s worth putting more effort into my job.</p>\n<p><strong>Q. One thing I was wondering about when I was doing an earning to give strategy is, has it ever come an issue at work that you&apos;re&#xA0;publicly&#xA0;doing an earning to give strategy? Does it affect your negotiating power?</strong></p>\n<p>It hasn&apos;t come up at all yet. I don&apos;t know if they&apos;ve seen any of my blog posts or not. I&apos;ve been blogging for years, and not just about effective altruism. When I was job searching, I&apos;m like, &quot;Is this going to affect me&quot;? I asked Simon, the guy who helps people from App Academy get jobs. I asked him about this, especially because I was interviewing at Palantir.</p>\n<p>I&apos;m like, &quot;Shit, is there something I said about Edward Snowden or something online...&quot; His response was, &quot;Yeah, they don&apos;t happen to give a shit. Nobody in the tech world gives a shit. If anything, they&apos;ll be impressed that you&apos;re bold and out there with your opinions.&quot;</p>\n<p>[Audience member comments: Jeff Kauffman has said that he has found that this increases his negotiating power because it&apos;s like, &quot;Oh, you want to save lives with it,&quot; rather than, &quot;Buy swimming pools&quot;?</p>\n<p>You can also often make favorable trades. Presumably, you&apos;re less risk averse with your money if you&apos;re donating it because there are fewer diminishing returns to your money. You can make favorable trades like sacrificing salary for equity that other people wouldn&apos;t be able to make.]</p>\n<p><strong>Q.&#xA0;Do you pay any attention to the direct impact of your work, or do you ignore that entirely and just aim for maximizing income?</strong></p>\n<p>On most things, the direct impact is going to be small positive or negative. Again, there&apos;s a replaceability issue there. There&apos;s a great post on 80K, <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2013/07/show-me-the-harm/\">&quot;Show me the harm?&quot;</a>&#xA0;It talked about people who say, &quot;Well, I wouldn&apos;t want to go to Goldman Sachs and make a lot of money and then donate it because Goldman Sachs is awful.&quot;</p>\n<p>They point out that Goldman Sachs has a lot of employees. Even if Goldman Sachs is truly directly responsible for wrecking the world economy, you&apos;re only responsible for a tiny percentage...&#xA0;</p>\n<p>[Laughter]</p>\n<p>Also, the fact that if you didn&apos;t go do it, probably someone else would &#xA0;which sounds much less nice, in this context versus the becoming-a-doctor context.</p>\n<p><strong>Q. You were just talking about how supply-constrained the computer science industry is. It&apos;s quite plausible that if you personally did not decide to go into computer science, it would be close to one less computer scientist in the world.</strong></p>\n<p>What might happen is that the startup I&apos;m working for would hire someone even less qualified than I was.</p>\n<p>My impression of how the software job market currently works in the Bay Area is that there are lots of companies that are really desperate, really, really desperate for people. Me not becoming a software engineer would just mean an incremental decrease in their standards of these companies.</p>\n<p><strong>Q. A lot of people follow the algorithm, hire everyone we possibly can, who&apos;s above a certain level. The place that I&apos;m interning at, I literally think it&apos;s possible that they would have one fewer intern if I wasn&apos;t an intern there.&#xA0;If you&apos;re thinking on the scale of industries, that actually does average out to normal supply demand dynamics, but if you think that you&apos;re working at one firm that does something particularly valuable, or particularly harmful, you may not actually be replaceable.</strong></p>\n<p>That actually may be correct. If they&apos;re following the, &quot;Here is out cutoff and we hire everyone above the cutoff,&quot; that&apos;s a good point. I didn&apos;t think of that. Thank you.</p>\n<p><strong>Q. Unrelated to the replaceability thing, in considering earning to give, do you think there is an amount of money that&apos;s the right amount or do you always want to be earning more money?&#xA0;Do you think you should be exploring ways to be earning millions of dollars?</strong></p>\n<p>This is an interesting and slightly complicated issue. Earning more money is always better. You can save more lives. I&apos;m happy with my current salary in so far as it&apos;s more than I ever expected to be making two years ago. There was a point in my job process where I thought I might have to accept a lower salary than what I&apos;m making right now.</p>\n<p>In that sense, I&apos;m happy with it. In terms of my long-term strategy, I&apos;m thinking, &quot;Will I eventually want to move to Google where they pay better&quot;? Back to the job market again, South Bay companies tend to pay better than San Francisco companies. With San Francisco companies, often they&apos;re small startups that are more likely to give you equity.</p>\n<p>How the heck do you value this equity? I talked to Alexei when I was preparing for this talk. He said that he felt that for any given software engineer, your expected value for working at a startup is higher because of equity. The thing is, by taking equity, you&apos;re taking on risk. In a well-functioning market, that means you&apos;re, yeah.</p>\n<p>That&apos;s what I said to him, &quot;Yes, in a well-functioning market, but are you sure&quot;? He&apos;s like, &quot;I&apos;m about 80 percent confident.&quot; He may be wrong.</p>\n<p>[Audience member: There&apos;s an equity risk premium, but there&apos;s also a startup trendiness premium.]</p>\n<p>Work for an untrendy startup is the answer.</p>\n<p>[Audience member: An evil, unpopular, ad startup. Or enterprise startup.]</p>\n<p>I&apos;m actually working for a B2B startup that does ad stuff.</p>\n<p><cite><strong>Q. Does valuing equity depend very strongly on your ability to predict whether the startup will succeed?</strong></cite></p>\n<p>That&apos;s a question. In theory, the risk premium means you don&apos;t know. The point is, you don&apos;t know if it will succeed. In exchange for the risk, there&apos;s a potential of a very high reward. If you start looking into a startup, you do want to be aware of warning signs like, &quot;Am I getting suckered on this equity offer or what&quot;?</p>\n<p>[Audience member: The market, the abstract concept, will have a certain amount of information that it&apos;s factoring in. If you have more information, then maybe you&apos;ll be able to make a better decision out of it. If you have less information, then maybe you stay aware of this and make decisions.]</p>\n<p>There&apos;s also the question of, would you be better off maybe just doing the obvious thing, working for Google and donating lots of money? How does startup equity compare to just going to Vanguard and saying you want their high risk, high return mutual funds or something versus startup equity?</p>\n<p><strong>Q. I would say why should startup equity be weighed it any differently than, say, investing in a VC fund? What I don&apos;t mean is why should you invest in a VC fund? I mean should you consider it as being more valuable than the amount that a VC is willing to pay for it?</strong></p>\n<p>Yes if you&apos;re less risk averse than the VC. The VC&apos;s are by definition taking risk, but they&apos;re probably still doing it for their own purposes. They probably have some recognition of having twice as expensive of a house is not. Yes, the VC&apos;s have to be risk tolerant by definition, but if you&apos;re looking at it from a perspective of donating to causes that have tons of room for more funding, you might want to be even less risk averse.</p>\n<p><strong>Q. Software development is certainly a very attractive job for growth purposes, but are there any others? Is there top five, top ten?</strong></p>\n<p>The thing about software development is it&apos;s one of the few things I know that it&apos;s easy to switch into once you&apos;re already out of college. I wish I had known this stuff when I was high school. If I had known this stuff when I was in high school, I would have applied to Harvard and Yale and the big Ivies and then, from there, looked at...</p>\n<p>Yeah, apply to Harvard and Yale and the big Ivies, major in statistics. Consider programming jobs, but also consider a job at Goldman Sachs. But if you&apos;ve already gotten your degree, it&apos;s much harder, I don&apos;t know if there&apos;s a way you could transition into finance.</p>\n<p>If you&apos;re still in high school, still in college, your options are way more open. In spite of the law and medicine, job markets aren&apos;t what they used to be, they&apos;re still lucrative careers. If you don&apos;t have the math background, but you&apos;re good at memorizing anatomy.

First, my sample size is small&#x2014;I only ran one group!

So interpret these notes with caution.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Notes:</strong> Cross-posted from&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/studentgroup\">benkuhn.net</a>.

Please&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/contact/\">get in touch</a>&#xA0;if you&#x2019;d like! Starting a student group is a great way to improve the world and you&#x2019;ll learn a lot doing it. I&#x2019;m always happy to help new student groups in whatever way I can.</em></p>\n<h1>Have two people</h1>\n<p>Far and away the most important factor in HEA&#x2019;s success is that we had two co-presidents.</p>\n<p>At first, it was just me running things, and my motivation and excitement about my plans came in bursts. I would get a new idea for a project or event and start organizing it in a flurry of energy&#x2014;but soon problems would come up, I&#x2019;d start to think it was doomed to failure and get demoralized, and everything I&#x2019;d set in motion would grind to a halt. Obviously this was self-defeating and not very helpful for our club&#x2019;s operations.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, towards the end of the first year, <a href=\"http://jasturm.blogspot.com/\">John Sturm</a> took the initiative and got involved with organizing events as well. With John to take care of half the organizational burden (and frequently more) and plug away even when I was demoralized, I felt much less overwhelmed about running things. This broke down my aversion that running more events would start another boom-bust motivation cycle for me, and allowed us to do way more things than we could have with just me.</p>\n<p>If you&#x2019;re more resilient to setbacks and more of a natural leader than I am, it may be less important for you to have a co-organizer. But given that finding a second person is also one of the most popular pieces of startup advice, it seems like it applies to most people, even if they&#x2019;re as resilient and leader-y as most startup founders. So I&#x2019;d recommend making it a high priority to find a co-organizer.</p>\n<p>That&#x2019;s hard, of course, because a co-organizer needs to have a lot of initiative and agency&#x2014;they have to care about the project even when you don&#x2019;t. On the other hand, if you can&#x2019;t find any good co-organizers before you start your group, don&#x2019;t worry too much&#x2014;I didn&#x2019;t know John before I started HEA, and only met him when he joined the group and came to some of our events. So you can probably recruit a co-organizer from your membership; just keep your eyes peeled for good ones, because it&#x2019;s a <em>huge</em> boost in organizational capacity.</p>\n<h1>Don&apos;t be embarrassed</h1>\n<p>The first time Harvard Effective Altruism did any sort of publicity was at Harvard&#x2019;s &#x201C;student activities fair,&#x201D; where literally every student group at Harvard lined up at rows of tables, and masochistic students ran the gauntlet in a doomed quest to find meaning in undergraduate life.</p>\n<p>We were running a <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/givinggames.aspx\">Giving Game</a> in which we presented people with three charities and asked them to choose one to receive a dollar.</p>\n<p>Here&#x2019;s how a typical HEA pitch went:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(student walks past)</p>\n<p>(another student walks past)</p>\n<p>(third student walks past)</p>\n<p>(fourth student walks past, awkwardly glances towards the HEA poster)</p>\n<p>Ben: Hi?</p>\n<p>Student: Um, hi, what is Harvard Effective Altruism?</p>\n<p>Ben: <em>(sheepishly)</em> Okay, so I know this sounds cheesy, but we actually try to figure out the best ways to improve the world and then do those things.</p>\n<p>Student: Huh?</p>\n<p>Ben: Like it turns out some charities are WAY better than others! Want to play this Giving Game?</p>\n<p>(bemused student makes excuses and leaves)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>After three hours of such pitches we had a grand total of one person who came back for more than one meeting.</p>\n<p>The reason our publicity was so disastrously bad is that I was bad at talking to people, for a couple of reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> I realized that the idea of HEA seemed crazy: &#x201C;join us and we&#x2019;ll try to figure out how to maximize the good we do in the world!&#x201D;&#x2014;it combined the tired cliche of trying to save the world with the taboo of declaring that some ways of saving it were better than others. But my mistake was <em>letting other people know</em> that I knew HEA seemed crazy. As soon as they realized that I myself felt goofy, it was game over for convincing them to get involved. </li>\n<li> Because I felt like I was pushing a crazy idea, I was also worried about wasting people&#x2019;s time. This was just silly. If the students didn&#x2019;t want their time wasted, they shouldn&#x2019;t have tried to run the activities-fair gauntlet. And anyway, they were perfectly capable of extracting themselves from the pitch if they wanted to. We should have been less polite. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>By contrast, here&#x2019;s a similar pitch from when we were advertising in a dining hall this year:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>(student walks past)</p>\n<p>(Ben walks up to them, holds out a dollar bill)</p>\n<p>(student automatically takes dollar bill)</p>\n<p>Ben: Do you want to donate this dollar to charity?</p>\n<p>Student: Huh?</p>\n<p>B: Like, we have a list of charities, and you can pick one to give this dollar to.</p>\n<p>S: Oh, okay, I guess.</p>\n<p>B: Awesome! It&#x2019;s actually not literally that dollar, it&#x2019;s this computer form. Can you read through these three blurbs and select whichever one you think will do the most good with your dollar?</p>\n<p>S: Sure.</p>\n<p>(S reads through blurbs)</p>\n<p>S: So what&#x2019;s the deal with this?</p>\n<p>B: I&#x2019;m glad you asked! So, like, you want to improve the world, right? <em>(S: Yeah.)</em> And you prefer improving it <em>more</em> if you can, right? <em>(S: Yeah.)</em> So we try to figure out how to improve it the most. It&#x2019;s weird how nobody else is doing that, huh?</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>By this time, I had gotten over my feeling of goofiness, and just powered through. I often acknowledged that HEA was <em>uncommon</em>, but not that it was <em>weird</em>. Plus, I was more aggressive about initially engaging with students&#x2014;they had come to be marketed at, after all. I still didn&#x2019;t give people a hard sell if they didn&#x2019;t seem interested, but I was okay with being pushy to get their attention away from all the other pushy people. As a result, students were way more interested and engaged.</p>\n<h1>Getting good speakers</h1>\n<p>If there&#x2019;s one thing that I&#x2019;m proud of about my tenure running HEA, it&#x2019;s our programming. Last year we had over 10 speakers come to give talks to HEA, including Peter Singer, Jaan Tallinn, and <a href=\"http://harvardea.org/events/#past\">many other extremely popular and busy people</a>. We also raised thousands of dollars to cover honoraria from these speakers. How?</p>\n<p>The trick is to be well-connected like me and John so that you know a diverse pool of famous people and deep-pocketed university organizations to lean on for favors. If you don&#x2019;t have such a pool already, get out there and network!</p>\n<p>&#x2026;just kidding. I didn&#x2019;t actually know most of our speakers before I invited them to speak. I just sent them a cold email asking if they wanted to give a talk for HEA (sometimes with an introduction from a friend or our excellent faculty adviser, <a href=\"http://medethics.med.harvard.edu/people/eyal/\">Nir</a>). We got a lot of silence&#x2014;my archives are littered with the corpses of unanswered invitations&#x2014;but we also got a lot of responses, and our awesome lineup of speakers was definitely worth the additional messages cast into the void.</p>\n<p>I also have an important sub-tip here. For emailing potential speakers&#x2014;and also for life in general&#x2014;I found <a href=\"http://www.boomeranggmail.com/\">Boomerang</a> to be <em>totally indispensable</em>. I set any sent emails to return to my inbox in a week if the recipient didn&#x2019;t respond, and often if I sent them a second follow-up email I&#x2019;d get a response after that. In fact, Boomerang is practically a requirement to communicate with some professors, who I suspect just have a policy of never responding to email the first time it&#x2019;s sent&#x2026; Again&#x2014;if you rely on email to make important things happen and you don&#x2019;t have Boomerang, start using Boomerang NOW.</p>\n<p>Psychologically, I often found it demoralizing to send cold emails, since each one individually had a fairly low chance of turning into a talk further down the road&#x2014;it often felt like most of my work was wasted (although our response rate was a lot higher than I thought it would be). I tried to fight this by <em>valuing effort instead of results</em>&#x2014;I would phrase my goals in terms of &#x201C;high-quality emails sent&#x201D; instead of &#x201C;responses received&#x201D; or &#x201C;talks scheduled.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>Overall, something like 20% of people we cold-emailed ended up giving a talk at HEA. I can&#x2019;t promise that this will translate to student groups at other schools&#x2014;we certainly benefited from the Harvard brand&#x2014;but even if we had gotten a much lower response rate, we could have sent more emails or started asking less-busy people. The credibility and attention that we got from having such a great lineup was a huge boost when we were recruiting new members, so I&#x2019;m really glad we did it.</p>\n<h1>Navigating Bureaucracy</h1>\n<p>Running a student group entails doing a lot of paperwork and getting through a lot of red tape. Especially at first, I had a hard time keeping track of everything, and frequently left things until the last minute (or later) when e.g. reserving space for events.</p>\n<p>After spending one too many afternoons on tenterhooks waiting for the room reservation office to email me back, I finally cracked under the stress. For once I had actually paid attention to the booking deadlines and reserved our room a week in advance&#x2014;but they still hadn&#x2019;t confirmed two days beforehand. Come hell or high water, I decided, I was going to get my room reserved <em>today</em>. I put on my best starving-frantic-student-in-need face, thought up my best excuses, and marched over to the Science Center to demand satisfaction.</p>\n<p>Instead of the hard-nosed, battle-ready bureaucrat I&#x2019;d been imagining, I was greeted by a very pleasant gentleman named Ron. Ron had gotten some files out of order and then been swamped by requests, because it was the beginning of the semester and all the student groups wanted space. He hadn&#x2019;t realized we&#x2019;d been waiting so long, and was happy I&#x2019;d stopped by to ask about it&#x2014;especially since we had to have some back-and-forth about the logistics, which went much faster in person than over email.</p>\n<p>As a software developer, I&#x2019;ve been trained to think that if Harvard specifies an interface for students to communicate with institutions, that interface is a Holy Abstraction Barrier That Shall Not Be Crossed. But it turns out that bureaucratic abstractions <a href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html\">leak</a> <em>even more</em> than computational ones&#x2014;the specified interfaces don&#x2019;t really work very well. Combine that with the depersonalizing medium of email, where everyone is tempted to be rude or stop replying, and you have a recipe for unpleasant experiences.</p>\n<p>I had the same experience again and again&#x2014;room booking, financial forms, advertising space, and practically everything else we did went much more smoothly if we <em>showed up in person</em>when we got confused or had something complicated to do. I still try to avoid it when possible&#x2014;it takes up people&#x2019;s time and would probably get annoying if we did it excessively, and having to resolve issues in person is a red flag that we&#x2019;re getting some other part of the process wrong. But if bureaucracy starts to drag on, showing up in person is an almost sure-fire way to speed things along.</p>\n<h1>Outside Support</h1>\n<p>One easy way that HEA achieved suprising or impressive-seeming things is that we <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/good-speakers\">reached out to lots of speakers</a>. A second is that we had a <em>ton</em> of support from folks who weren&#x2019;t in our &#x201C;core audience&#x201D; of Harvard students. Both Harvard faculty and other EA-minded people gave us huge amounts of information, technical assistance, introductions, and even offers of funding if we needed it.</p>\n<p>An incomplete list of things that we&#x2019;ve needed non-student help for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Our amazing faculty adviser <a href=\"http://medethics.med.harvard.edu/people/eyal/\">Nir</a> gave us a lot of suggestions and introductions to speakers, checked in periodically when we were having organizational problems, gave us advice on hosting speakers, and was generally all-around ridiculously helpful.</p>\n<p>HEA was actually required to have a faculty adviser per Harvard&#x2019;s regulations, but I highly recommend having one even if your school doesn&#x2019;t require you to&#x2014;you can invite a sympathetic professor to be your official adviser and then meet with them, ask them advice by email, or whatever works for you.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other Harvard faculty mentioned our activities in their classes, advertised our speakers, donated to our fundraiser, or had discussions over dinner with our members. These were all immensely helpful. In retrospect I wish we had tried to interact with more faculty, and more closely, than we did&#x2014;I think many of them would have been happy to help even more.</p>\n<p>If you don&#x2019;t know where to look for faculty, try the professors of philosophy (especially ethics), economics (especially development), public health (especially medical ethics), and psychology (especially moral psychology). Also try <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/contact/\">emailing me</a>, as I may be able to connect you with other folks nearby.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://jefftk.com/\">Jeff</a> and <a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/\">Julia</a> usually give the first talk of every semester, introducing new members to the ideas of effective altruism. Since they&#x2019;re more relatable to college students than HEA&#x2019;s typical speakers are (many of whom are professors or nonprofit executives), they&#x2019;re great at providing a friendly and welcoming introduction to effective altruism.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>An (anonymous) local effective altruist sponsored a matching challenge for our first winter fundraiser, which made it much more credible and much more motivating for people to donate. This made the fundraiser way more exciting both to the students running it and to the folks who donated.</p>\n<p>Another supporter offered us a substantial amount of money in back-up funds if the Harvard grants that we were applying for didn&#x2019;t come through. Although we didn&#x2019;t end up needing the funds last year, it was very helpful to be able to promise speakers with certainty that we&#x2019;d be able to reimburse their travel and lodging expenses.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other folks from the local Boston EA group came to our talks, advertised them to their friends, donated to our fundraiser, let us know when interesting speakers were passing through Boston, and generally provided a ton of miscellaneous advice and help.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I can&#x2019;t speak for other kinds of student groups, but if you&#x2019;re starting an effective altruism student group in particular, finding people who are willing to help is pretty easy&#x2014;just post in the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/?ref=br_tf\">Facebook group</a> or <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/contact/\">email me</a> and I&#x2019;ll put you in touch with folks who can help!</p>\n<h1>Lessons From the Philanthropy Fellowship</h1>\n<p>The event we ran that really got our membership going was what we called the &#x201C;philanthropy fellowship.&#x201D; Although the content was specific to HEA&#x2019;s mission, I think the idea and lessons generalize to any kind of student group. Here&#x2019;s how the philanthropy fellowship worked:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>We <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/TODO\">cold-emailed a bunch of awesome people</a> asking them to give talks for Harvard Effective Altruism&#x2019;s philanthropy fellowship.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We also got <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/support\">an anonymous donor</a> to promise to match any funds our philanthropy fellowship raised for the term.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>At all of our events at the beginning of the year, we told everyone that we were running a &#x201C;philanthropy fellowship&#x201D; program in which fellows would apply and be accepted to attend a series of talks and dinners with our awesome speakers, and run a fundraiser at the end. At this point I believe our list of promised speakers included Peter Singer and Jaan Tallinn, so this generated a fair amount of interest.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We put up <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/TODO\">an application</a> with some basic questions, gave it a deadline, and publicized it to a ton of mailing lists (both ones for which it was on-topic, and dorm-wide mailing lists where it was permissible to hawk random clubs/activities.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>After the deadline, we called back all the applicants we thought were a good fit for a short one-on-one interview with one of the HEA organizers, where we asked them a couple questions (mostly to get to know them) and gave a little spiel about how the fellowship would go (schedule, expectations for attendance, the fundraiser at the end, etc.).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>We weren&#x2019;t very selective at all with the application&#x2014;we mainly used it to screen out people who were obviously there just to promote their own charities, and I think we invited everyone who interviewed to do the fellowship.</p>\n<p>But it still ended up creating a core group of people who came to nearly all of our events and engaged with HEA a lot. I&#x2019;m not sure about all the factors that led to the success of the philanthropy fellowship, but I have a couple theories. (Note that these are <em>only theories</em>, i.e., not empirically verified&#x2014;so generalize at your own risk!)</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>There was a big incentive for joining the fellowship. Although our speakers&#x2019; talks were open to the public, the dinners with them were restricted to members of the philanthropy fellowship. We advertised this fact heavily and I&#x2019;m sure the prospect of dinner with Peter Singer got at least one person to join.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scarcity creates value. If people perceive your group as hard to get into&#x2014;even if it isn&#x2019;t&#x2014;then they&#x2019;ll value their membership in it more, and get more excited about your events. This is why we had an application process, even though it was more work for us and we only rejected a couple people.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>We asked for an explicit commitment to attend events first. A problem for a lot of groups is that students are really interested at the beginning of the semester, but as classwork piles on they start to feel swamped and stop going to as many events. Since we asked students to commit to attending the entire fellowship at the beginning of the semester, they tended to make it a higher priority.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Of course, there are plenty of other lessons we learned from the fellowship as well&#x2014;mainly about how we could have run it better.</p>\n<h1>Advertising Strategies</h1>\n<p>HEA tried a lot of different ways of getting people&#x2019;s attention. Here are some of our workhorses&#x2014;strategies that we use frequently and generally work well:</p>\n<h2>Giving Games</h2>\n<p><em>(Note: somewhat EA-specific, though the general spirit applies to other types of groups.)</em></p>\n<p>One thing almost all student groups do a lot of is tabling. We&#x2019;ve found that interactive activities work pretty well&#x2014;we often run <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/get-involved/giving-game-2\">Giving Games</a> where we put up $1 for each participant and they decide to donate it to one of a list of charities we provide, based on which one they think will be the most effective.</p>\n<p>Giving Games are cool in that they&#x2019;re very easy to study scientifically&#x2014;if you display peoples&#x2019; charity choices on a computer, you can very easily randomize what text and what options people see. You can then measure how many people give you their emails at the end of the Giving Game, as a proxy for how engaging they found the game. HEA did <a href=\"http://harvardea.org/news/2014/06/13/research/\">some of this research</a>at the end of last semester and found some interesting results.</p>\n<p>First, including more speculative charities may decrease people&#x2019;s engagement. HEA tested a group of three global poverty charities against a group of one global poverty charity, one &#x201C;meta&#x201D; charity, and one charity working on existential risks, and found that people offered the latter choice were significantly less likely to put down their emails.</p>\n<p>Also, the data suggested (weakly, not-quite-significantly) that including information about how effective charities were <em>decreased</em> people&#x2019;s engagement in the game. This might be a real effect, but it&#x2019;s possible it was due to confounding because the descriptions containing effectiveness info were longer, and people got bored. Or it&#x2019;s possible that it&#x2019;s a mere statistical fluctuation. More research is needed to find out, but either way, it&#x2019;s a good reminder to keep Giving Games short and sweet.</p>\n<p>If you&#x2019;re running an EA group and want to run one, there&#x2019;s more information at the link above. You can also get in touch with The Life You Can Save and they may be willing to fund your Giving Game.</p>\n<h2>Giant eye-catching posters</h2>\n<p>And I do mean giant. Harvard has a set of four sandwich boards at the gate between Harvard Yard and the Science Center, which can be reserved one face at a time. Most student organizations take their normal event posters and tile the entire face of the sandwich board with about 20 of these. For our first talk of the semester, we instead decided to blow up our poster of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Temkin\">Larry Temkin</a>&#x2018;s face by a factor of 20. A surprising number of folks at the event told us that the poster was how they found out about it, and I think a lot of this was that it was more eye-catching than the typical student-group poster.</p>\n<h2>Professors</h2>\n<p>Often if you&#x2019;re holding an academic-ish event, professors in related fields will happily promote it in their classes. HEA has had success asking professors in philosophy, economics, and public health to advertise various of our events. Professors also make <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/support\">great allies in general</a>, and asking them to introduce your event in class can be a great icebreaker.</p>\n<h2>Personal appeals</h2>\n<p>Asking your friends to go to your events isn&#x2019;t particularly scalable. But for more targeted things like applying to the <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/fellowship\">philanthropy fellowship</a>, we&#x2019;ve had good success with individually asking friends if they&#x2019;d be interested in applying. Of course, you should only do this with friends that you <em>actually</em> think would be interested, since it&#x2019;s rude to pester your friends, and if they end up not enjoying the event they might get annoyed. But</p>\n<h2>Mass communications</h2>\n<p>HEA has a mailing list of a few hundred students, and we also sent out emails to a number of general-interest mailing lists (e.g. dorm-specific mailing lists).</p>\n<p>It looks a bit nicer to send emails to each list individually, and include a little bit of list-specific content in the email. But that&#x2019;s annoying, because it means you have to cut-and-paste your email to a bunch of different lists. To speed up that process, you can <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5508283/how-to-set-up-a-mail-merge-in-gmail-for-personalized-mass-emails\">set up a mail merge in Gmail</a> and send a batch of emails with customizations from a spreadsheet.</p>\n<p>We also used mail-merges sometimes when emailing applicants for the philanthropy fellowship, and it&#x2019;s possible that you could use it for cold-emailing professors as well (although we haven&#x2019;t tried it, and it takes some care to make the writing good enough and specific enough that the generic parts don&#x2019;t sound bad).</p>\n<p>The benefits of mail merge come not only from speeding up the batch emails that you were going to send anyway, but causing you to send much more email because it&#x2019;s easier. Email can be quite effective at drumming up interest for talks and fellowships, so this is a pretty big boost.</p>\n<h2>Facebook event invitations</h2>\n<p>We created Facebook events for all of our talks and mass-invited our classmates to these. In addition to letting people know about the events, but it also helped us gauge attendance and distribute messages (e.g. updates about the event location or links to slides) to everyone who wanted to attend. We included event RSVP links in all of our emails to lists as well, to contribute as much as possible to having one centralized place where everyone going to the event could get info.</p>\n<p>Mass-inviting all your relevant Facebook friends to every event is a huge slog, of course, because if you don&#x2019;t want to spam people you have to manually curate the list of people you invite, which means looking through your entire friend list and making a decision for each friend for each event. Fortunately, there&#x2019;s a much easier way, which takes advantage of the fact that if you make a &#x201C;friend list&#x201D; on Facebook, their algorithms will automatically suggest that you add other similar friends to it. Here&#x2019;s how it works:</p>\n<ol>\n<li> First, create a Friend List and add maybe 50 or so classmates on it that you want to invite to your group&#x2019;s events. Then go to the list and look at the friend suggestions&#x2014;Facebook will suggest that you add the rest of your classmates. Add whomever you want (I suggest all of them, since invite spam is normal, but if you want to curate the list more heavily, Facebook will get smarter about who it suggests to be on the list). </li>\n<li> Now add a bookmark in your browser to the following link: <code> javascript:elms=document.getElementsByName(&quot;checkableitems[]&quot;);for (i=0;i&lt;elms.length;i++){if (elms[i].type=&quot;checkbox&quot;)elms[i].click()}; </code> </li>\n<li> Now when you want to mass-invite these people to an event, go to the event page and click &#x201C;Invite Friends&#x201D;. Click the dropdown that says &#x201C;Search by Name&#x201D; and select the list that you made in step 1. You should now see all the people on the list show up below. </li>\n<li> Scroll all the way down that list (this is important&#x2014;the later checkboxes won&#x2019;t appear until you scroll down, so you won&#x2019;t end up inviting everybody otherwise). </li>\n<li> Click the bookmark you made in step 2. Everyone should be checked off and you can invite them! </li>\n<li> Facebook limits the number of people you can invite in one swoop, so to double-check that you invited everyone, repeat steps 3-4 and verify that all the checkboxes are greyed-out (this means the friend has already been invited). If not, repeat steps 3-5 as necessary. </li>\n</ol>\n<p>This is way faster than manually checking a bunch of boxes&#x2014;about 30 seconds instead of 5-10 minutes for me. It also means that we can reliably get all the organizers to invite their friends, which means our Facebook events have a much broader reach.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Ben_Kuhn"}}, {"_id": "xmn6RkHvdNu3Hqify", "title": "The Economist on \"extreme altruism\"", "postedAt": "2014-09-18T19:53:52.287Z", "htmlBody": "<p><a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21618676-self-sacrifice-it-seems-biological-opposite-psychopathy-right\">Extreme altruism: right on!</a>, <em>The Economist</em>, September 20th, 2014. An excerpt:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Flyers at petrol stations do not normally ask for someone to donate a kidney to an unrelated stranger. That such a poster, in a garage in Indiana, actually did persuade a donor to come forward might seem extraordinary. But extraordinary people such as the respondent to this appeal (those who volunteer to deliver aid by truck in Syria at the moment might also qualify) are sufficiently common to be worth investigating. And in a paper published this week in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Abigail Marsh of Georgetown University and her colleagues do just that. Their conclusion is that extreme altruists are at one end of a \u201ccaring continuum\u201d which exists in human populations\u2014a continuum that has psychopaths at the other end. [...]</p>\n<p>She and her team used two brain-scanning techniques, structural and functional magnetic-resonance imaging (MRI), to study the amygdalas of 39 volunteers, 19 of whom were altruistic kidney donors. (The amygdalas, of which brains have two, one in each hemisphere, are areas of tissue central to the processing of emotion and empathy.) Structural MRI showed that the right amygdalas of altruists were 8.1% larger, on average, than those of people in the control group, though everyone\u2019s left amygdalas were about the same size. That is, indeed, the obverse of what pertains in psychopaths, whose right amygdalas, previous studies have shown, are smaller than those of controls.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Whether this applies to EAs, however, is unclear. Compare Peter Singer's recent <a href=\"http://www.bostonreview.net/forum/against-empathy/peter-singer-response-against-empathy-peter-singer\">remarks</a>\u00a0in a panel discussion about empathy:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>My admittedly impressionistic observation is that effective altruists are not especially empathetic\u2014at least, not in the sense of emotional empathy. They do have what is sometimes called \u201ccognitive empathy\u201d or \u201cperspective taking\u201d capacity\u2014that is, the ability to see what life is like for someone else.</p>\n</blockquote>", "user": {"username": "Pablo_Stafforini"}}, {"_id": "qBbyx8KyGhFe3Dy3C", "title": "Supportive Scepticism", "postedAt": "2014-09-18T14:02:36.734Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>I&#x2019;d like to raise an aspect of effective altruism that I personally find difficult. My hope is that this will promote discussion and help others who feel similarly.</p>\n<p>I want to preface this by saying I am incredibly glad that I got involved in the effective altruism community, and that I think overall my life is a lot better because of it. I feel like I have a much greater sense of purpose and belief that I can do good in the world, I have an incredible network of friends with similar values and interests, and a great deal more ambition. Plus I&#x2019;m actually doing more to make the world better, of course.</p>\n<p>But there&#x2019;s also something about EA that causes me a distress I didn&#x2019;t have before.</p>\n<p>The whole point of effective altruism is that we don&#x2019;t just want to do good; we want to do the most good possible. But figuring out the &#x201C;best possible&#x201D; thing for any person to do is incredibly difficult. And a strong desire to do the best possible thing coupled with a huge amount of uncertainty is a recipe for&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/stress\">dissatisfaction</a>.</p>\n<h2>The first part of the problem is that it&#x2019;s easy to put a lot of pressure on yourself as an effective altruist.</h2>\n<p>I personally spend a lot of time thinking about whether what I&#x2019;m doing right now really is the best thing, or whether I could be doing something better. And whilst some doubt and scepticism is definitely useful, I can&#x2019;t help but think I&#x2019;m doubting myself more than is useful. It seems quite likely I would be happier and more effective in what I&#x2019;m doing if I doubted myself less. At the very least, I&#x2019;d simply be doing more things. I spend far too much of my time in analysis paralysis.</p>\n<p>To give a concrete example: I&#x2019;ve just finished my first year of a PhD program. And I&#x2019;ve spent a good proportion of that first year agonising with myself over the question: &#x201C;What should my thesis topic be?&#x201D;. Every time someone suggested a topic or I thought about narrowing down on an area a little voice in my head would go &#x201C;But what if that&#x2019;s not the best thing for you to research? What if this other thing was better?&#x201D;. You can see how this kind of thinking might start to drive you crazy, and how it might also lead me to feel quite unmotivated to work on my PhD.</p>\n<h2>Part two of the problem is that it&#x2019;s also easy to end up putting a lot of pressure on each other.</h2>\n<p>One of the key parts of effective altruism is that we don&#x2019;t take claims of do-gooding at face value: just because something sounds like it does good, or produces a warm glow, doesn&#x2019;t mean that it&#x2019;s actually doing good. So every time we hear about some kind of altruistic endeavour, we automatically think, &#x201C;But is that really effective?&#x201D;. This also happens when we talk to each other about our plans. When I&#x2019;m telling another effective altruist about what I&#x2019;m working on or what my long-term plan is, there&#x2019;s often that niggling voice in the back of my head going, &#x201C;I wonder if they&#x2019;re thinking this isn&#x2019;t very effective and judging me....&#x201D;. This can also make us appear unwelcoming to people who are new to the ideas of effective altruism. Unfortunately scepticism and warmth just don&#x2019;t seem to be that well correlated.</p>\n<p>I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;m alone in worrying about this - I&#x2019;ve spoken to a number of other effective altruists who experience something similar. It seems like quite a few people worry about not being &#x201C;effective enough&#x201D; or &#x201C;not doing enough good&#x201D; more than is helpful. And I think this is actually a pretty big problem. It may be stopping people from making as much difference as they could. It may also be preventing us from being as warm and encouraging towards each other as we could be, especially towards people new to the ideas of effective altruism.</p>\n<h2>So what can we do about this?</h2>\n<p>The crux of the problem seems to be that it&#x2019;s difficult to be sceptical and supportive: both of other people, and of ourselves. But I don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s an inevitable consequence of being sceptical that we&#x2019;ll end up putting pressure on ourselves and others.</p>\n<p>I think one thing that&#x2019;s useful in itself is just for people to admit that they feel this pressure sometimes. Hearing that other people feel the way I do - that other people worry about whether they&#x2019;re doing the best thing, and worry about what others think of them - helped me to realise that it wasn&#x2019;t just me, and accept that what I was feeling was natural. That&#x2019;s a big part of the reason I&#x2019;m writing this post: so people who feel this way, even a little bit, can realise that it may be a pretty common feeling. I&#x2019;d be really interested to hear from people the extent to which they can identify with what they described, to know how common it is. Obviously if you don&#x2019;t feel this way, that&#x2019;s great - maybe you have some great strategies or ways of thinking those of us who do can use!</p>\n<p>The next step is for us to just make sure we are being kind and encouraging - both towards each other and ourselves. We could also reward this behaviour so it becomes more of a community norm. I find actually trying to change my patterns of thought really useful - it&#x2019;s so easy to get into the habit of thinking hypercritically every time you hear a claim. Now, when I hear a new idea from someone, I try to think about what it&#x2019;s virtues might be instead of/as well as thinking of ways it might be improved (note: improved, not wrong.) Mental habits are <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/ita/how_habits_work_and_how_you_may_control_them/\">relatively malleable</a> if you practice.</p>\n<h2>To conclude:</h2>\n<p>Being kind and being sceptical aren&apos;t mutually exclusive, but it&apos;s easy to end up feeling like they are. When we think of incredibly warm and kind people, they tend to be the kind of people who will say any idea is wonderful. Of course, this is exactly what effective altruism is trying to oppose: we don&apos;t want to lose our habits of rigorously examining arguments and evidence. But just as important is ensuring we don&apos;t go too far in the other direction; that we don&apos;t become cold towards each other and ourselves. If we can&apos;t suspend our scepticism for long enough to make decisions, or listen to someone else&apos;s plans without immediately writing them off, then we&apos;re unlikely to get very far.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Jess_Whittlestone"}}, {"_id": "72tsrbeQ2xb9mRYoE", "title": "Minor Updates", "postedAt": "2014-09-18T14:00:51.920Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>Hi all,</p>\n<p>I have some small news.

most people, it doesn&apos;t even occur to them that they giving a large share of their salary to charity is something that people actually can do, or&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org\">that people are doing on a regular basis</a>.</p>\n<p>Being public with one&apos;s pledge to donate not only spreads information about how easy it is to fight global poverty with a serious commitment, but that such commitments are the kind of thing that people can actually take. &#xA0;By being public with these pledges, we can actually inspire people to give, where they otherwise wouldn&apos;t.</p>\n<p>But how did people get stuck in a rut? &#xA0;Why doesn&apos;t giving money come naturally? &#xA0;And how would public declarations help dig people out of this rut?</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>The Bystander Effect and The Assumption of Self-Interest</h2>\n<p>First, to understand how to get people to give we have to understand why they currently do not. &#xA0;There are&#xA0;<a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/e2n/why_dont_people_help_others_more/\">a number of reasons</a>, but one of the most prevalent is what&apos;s called the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bystander Effect\">bystander effect</a>. &#xA0;While this effect is widely known in groups failing to respond to disasters right in front of their faces, it&apos;s magnified when the disaster is global poverty a continent or two away. &#xA0;We think that because other people around us are not giving, it must also not be our responsibility, and we sure wouldn&apos;t want to be suckered into helping when no one else is doing their fair share.</p>\n<p>Ever since Thomas Hobbes&apos;s&#xA0;<strong>The Leviathan</strong>, seeing human nature in terms of selfishness has been common, and persists to this day[1,2] as a strong and occasionally self-reinforcing belief[3,4]. &#xA0;People think of monetary incentives as being the most effective incentive for encouraging blood donations[5], even when this turns out to not be the case[6]. &#xA0;People greatly over-estimate the amount people will support a policy that favors them over other people[5]. &#xA0;As noted by Alexis de Tocqueville in 1835, &quot;Americans enjoy explaining almost every act of their lives on the principle of self-interest&quot;[7].</p>\n<p>This leads us to a natural assumption that donating to charity is irrational... or, at least, other people aren&apos;t doing it, so neither should I. &#xA0;However, this norm of self-interest is largely a myth, and people seem to do better than most people expect.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Challenging the Self-Interest Norm</h2>\n<p>This means the self-interest norm has to be challenged, and if it is challenged, we can expect people to revise their selfish-based theory of human nature and turn to more selfless acts like charitable giving. &#xA0;If we&apos;re interested in getting people to donate more than what they already do, we need to open people up to the idea that charitable giving cannot only be virtuous but&#xA0;<em>expected</em>, and can be done not only at the typical rate of 1%, but at rates of 10% or much higher[8]. &#xA0;We also should challenge the norm that charity should be silent and not spoken about, and instead mention it openly and proudly[9].</p>\n<p>People tend to conform, both intentionally and unintentionally, adopting the actions of others[4], and end up unwilling to adopt contrary actions unless other people are also going along with them. &#xA0;If peer pressure can make high schoolers turn to drug use, alcohol drinking, cigarette smoking, or even drop out of high school[10], surely it can stop people from giving.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>For example, take the famous&#xA0;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asch_conformity_experiments\">Asch Conformity Experiments</a>. &#xA0;Here, people were in a group and asked to look at a line and compare its length to three other lines on another card, and state which line matches the height of the first line. &#xA0;The task is enormously simple, but is complicated by being in a group of several other people, all in on the experiment, all who give the identical wrong answer.</p>\n<p>Asch found that many people would conform to this wrong answer, even against their better judgement. &#xA0;However, by adding another subject to this experiment who would give the correct answer, the tendency to conform would drop dramatically, even though the correct answer is still in the minority. &#xA0;Take away the partner, even halfway through the experiment with the same subject, and conformity shoots back up.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>However, allowing people an escape from this norm can lead them to be able to increase their charitable donations. &#xA0;In one field experiment, a radio station would mention to potential donors whenever a previous donor had donated $300, and they found that this increased donations by $13 more per person over the control condition, and these donors were also more likely to renew their memberships and donate more the next year compared to those in the control condition[11].</p>\n<p>In a separate field experiment, donors gave more to a radio station when prompted with an amount that was higher than their previous contribution[12]. &#xA0;Lastly, a third field experiment found that student donors were more likely to give to funds for students when told that 64% of other students had donated than when they were told that 46% of other students had donated[13].</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Overall, people are moved by seeing what others do, and can be tilted away from self-destructive norms by seeing other people go against the flow. &#xA0;An organization like Giving What We Can making a public stand for giving can accomplish just that. &#xA0;Make your giving public, and it should multiply as you inspire others.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Motivations and Fights for Status</h2>\n<p>Reflecting on the need to push up the norm to accurately reflect the giving nature of society, it seems like the pushback to privatize giving is harmful. &#xA0;And I think it is. &#xA0;But why does it come about in the first place? &#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/09/covert-virtue-the-signal-that-doesnt-bark.html\">Robert Wiblin speculates</a>&#xA0;that being public about giving calls your motivations into question. &#xA0;If you&apos;re only motivated by compassion for those in need, why do you need to boast?</p>\n<p>Well, of course, there&apos;s an interest in raising the norm. &#xA0;But let&apos;s assume that giving was really just a giant fight for status... would that be so bad? &#xA0;All else being equal, I prefer pure intention to that of giving just to prove to others, but competing for status via donation oneupmanship is&#xA0;<em>considerably</em>&#xA0;more useful than competing for status via bigger houses, bigger cars, and bigger flatscreen TVs.</p>\n<p>Or rather, people still end up competing over their charitable contributions, but it comes in the forms of significantly less-effective (though still arguably worthwhile) charitable competition, like&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/news/2012-11-20\">volunteering</a>, building schools, or adopting African children. &#xA0;If, instead, we normalized people giving checks, at least more people could be helped while the status fight goes on.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>Many people want to leave the world in a better place than they found it, perhaps even going as far as wanting to do the best they can. &#xA0;To these people, I hope that the idea of donation, especially to&#xA0;<a href=\"http://givewell.org/giving101\">effective causes</a>&#xA0;in&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.utilitarian-essays.com/make-money.html\">potentially large amounts</a>&#xA0;ends up appealing. &#xA0;But if this cool idea is seen as &quot;boastful&quot;, it won&apos;t catch on, and won&apos;t get the publicity (I think) it deserves.</p>\n<p>Moreover, people won&apos;t be able to network together and share information about more cost-effective charities or the latest trends in development economics, because everyone will be keeping it to themselves, ending up being collectively self-defeating.</p>\n<p>We seem forced by society to pretend to be self-interested, because we&apos;re asked to not talk about our acts of kindness. &#xA0;But this only goes to re-enforce the deadly cycle. &#xA0;The only way to push ourselves out of this cycle is to demonstrate that some people do donate and push up this norm. &#xA0;And groups like&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org\">GivingWhatWeCan</a>,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.80000hours.org\">80000 Hours</a>, and&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.boldergiving.org/\">BolderGiving</a>&#xA0;are working on doing just that.</p>\n<p>Personally, I&apos;d have to agree that this works -- I&apos;m inspired by these stories, and I don&apos;t think I would ever be donating 10%+ without a group that makes it seem like a completely normal and awesome thing to do.</p>\n<p>So is talking about donations too boastful? &#xA0;I think, for the sake of those the donations help, we can afford a little boasting in this one area.</p>\n<p><strong>If you want to pledge a certain donation level for the whole world to see,

as List was already summarizing his research.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2><strong>Why People Give</strong></h2>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Altruism is not as a big of a deal as people think when it comes to motivating donations -- instead people are frequently driven by self-interest. &#xA0;It&#x2019;s important to play into this. &#xA0;Your fundraising should be somewhat about giving the donor the ability to brag about how good of a person they are at the Thanksgiving table, though it won&#x2019;t work if you&#x2019;re explicit about it. &#xA0;The point is to create a &#x201C;warm glow&#x201D;.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>A lot of giving is due to social pressure. &#xA0;For example, people will donate when confronted by a Brownie Scout, but will go out of their way to avoid a Brownie Scout in the first place so they don&#x2019;t &#x201C;have to&#x201D; donate.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>A lot of giving is also due to herding. &#xA0;People give where their friends give.</li>\n</ul>\n<div><br></div>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<h2><strong>How to Raise More Money</strong></h2>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>There&#x2019;s a culture of tradition when it comes to fundraising advice, and not many people fundraise based on statistics.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>List believes a typical response rate for a good campaign to cold call people to ask for money is 1%. &#xA0;Americans already give 2-2.5% of their income on average.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>People will give more if it&#x2019;s convenient. &#xA0;If there were a button to donate during the podcast, a decent amount of people would do it, but virtually no-one will remember to go on their computer and donate after the podcast is over.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Attractiveness of the fundraiser is important in door-to-door fundraising. &#xA0;Men give more to good-looking women, but women do not give more to good-looking men or women, nor do men give more to good-looking men (though I don&#x2019;t know if this study looked into gay men). &#xA0;This effect is rather large &#x2014;- a woman rated a &#x201C;9&#x201D; in attractiveness raises twice as much on average as a woman rated a &#x201C;6&#x201D;.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>The best way List found to motivate donations was to offer a lottery with a chance of winning something that is really desirable. &#xA0;Every dollar someone gives or raises for the cause should give them one more shot to win. &#xA0;This outperforms offering prizes for meeting certain donation levels, though it&#x2019;s unclear what the effect is of doing both. &#xA0;Also, to offer a lottery one should check gambling laws. &#xA0;Typically, an exception of no donation being necessary to enter will be legally required.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Matching funds are very useful at motivating donations. &#xA0;Though keep in mind a 3:1 match offers the same benefit as a 1:1 match, so use those extra matching funds for something else.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>If possible, emphasize what the donor will lose if fundraising isn&#x2019;t met, as loss aversion is powerful. &#xA0;Though, this works better for local art museums than for donating to the third world. &#xA0;On the flip-side, though, donations to the third world can more easily create warm glows than art museums, so the advantage is pretty even. &#xA0;Also, keep in mind that loss aversion advertising can appear overly desparate if not done carefully.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>...Now go out there and raise more money. :)&#xA0;</p>\n<p>(Next, <a href=\"/ea/cs/how_i_raised_501032_for_amf_and_how_you_can_too/\">I use these techniques and raise $5010.32...</a>)</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Peter_Hurford"}}, {"_id": "4Pek6aKbEoXSZvNFT", "title": "Open Thread", "postedAt": "2014-09-15T15:40:17.810Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p>Welcome to the first open thread on the Effective Altruism Forum.

However, frequently <strong>doing something </strong>and <strong>starting somewhere </strong>is a lot better than just thinking and ending up <em>not doing anything</em>. So here&apos;s a quick list of things that EAs can do.</p>\n<h2><br></h2>\n<h2>Donate Smarter</h2>\n<p>This is perhaps the most <em>classic </em>option for an effective altruist. Money can go a long way when donated to a top charity -- and GiveWell has spent tens of thousands of hours to find <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">some outstanding charities that are thoroughly vetted and in need of funding</a> in order to make the world a better place!</p>\n<p>If you&apos;re already donating money to a <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">GiveWell top charity</a>, then great! But, if you&apos;re not, then<strong> consider whether your existing donations might go further</strong> when guided by the highest quality research on how to get the biggest bang for your buck in the charity sector. There are certainly good reasons -- both personal and altruistic -- to not donate to a GiveWell-picked org, but a great way to make the world a better place is to donate some of your money there!</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.com/\">The Life You Can Save</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><br></h2>\n<h2>Small Life Boosts</h2>\n<p>However, you don&apos;t just have to donate money. There are other small boosts you can make to increase your charitable contributions at no cost to you.</p>\n<p><strong>Join Amazon Smile. </strong>Sign up at <a href=\"http://smile.amazon.com\">smile.amazon.com</a> and choose a charity of your choice, and they&apos;ll get <strong>0.5%</strong> of all future Amazon purchase amounts, <em>as long as you remember to go to smile.amazon.com when you shop</em>. You can type in the charity into the box. Both &quot;GiveWell&quot; (under their non-profit name &quot;Clear Fund&quot;) and &quot;GiveDirectly&quot; are available.</p>\n<p><strong>Join some mailing lists. </strong>Stay informed about what organizations are up to by following <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/getinvolved/newsletter.aspx\">The Life You Can Save mailing list</a>, <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/about/stay-updated\">GiveWell mailing list</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/about/media/newsletter/\">Animal Charity Evaluators</a> mailing list.</p>\n<p><strong>Set up an altruistic tip jar. </strong>If you&apos;re feeling weighed down by rejecting nice causes that happen to not be <em>the single best cause in the whole world </em>and/or you feel the urge to donate now but think it more prudent to make one donation at the end of the year, you could make an altruistic tip jar -- throw in a poker chip every time you feel moved to donate, and then count the results at the end of the year when you want to turn that donation into cash. The system also feels more tangible and exciting than donating online. <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/3kl/optimizing_fuzzies_and_utilons_the_altruism_chip/\">...Here&apos;s more on this idea.</a></p>\n<h2><br></h2>\n<h2>Try Out Advocacy</h2>\n<p>Also, you don&apos;t have to donate <em>your own </em>money -- you could <strong>encourage other people to donate</strong>, which not only raises money, but spreads the word!</p>\n<p><strong>Talk to friends</strong></p>\n<p>The easiest way to advocate for top charities is to simply talk to people. When effective altruism comes up in conversation, don&apos;t be afraid to talk about it. (Though no need to go out of your way to talk to people about it if you feel shy.) And sometimes it comes up in unexpected ways. For example, if someone mentions that they don&apos;t know what they want to do after college, you could suggest they look into <a href=\"http://www.80000hours.org/\">80,000 Hours</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Run a Giving Game</strong></p>\n<p>Another way to engage people with the idea of weighing charities is to run a Giving Game. Giving Games are when players are introduced to a few pre-selected charities and are given an opportunity to dialogue about them and ultimately decide which of the charities to make a donation to, with the donation usually being supplied by the person running the Giving Game. Many Giving Games involve a moderated discussion, but other structures could be used. Giving Games could be online, over casual conversation, at a university, or placed on a street corner.</p>\n<p>Ben Kuhn and Harvard Effective Altruism found that Giving Games are <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/outreach\">one of the best ways to engage people with effective altruism</a>. <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/\">The Life You Can Save</a> runs many Giving Games and has compiled <a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/givinggames.aspx\">a lot of resources on them</a>.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/givinggames/resources.aspx\">Resources on Charities for Giving Games</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/givinggames/faq.aspx\">Frequently Asked Questions about Giving Games</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/givinggames/tips.aspx\">Tips for Running a Giving Game</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><br></h2>\n<h2>Run a Fundraiser</h2>\n<p>A specific way to advocate for top charities is to run a fundraiser. One idea is to run a fundraiser for your birthday -- people tend to be very receptive to this, and <a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/birthday-fundraisers.html\">it&apos;s really easy to do</a>.</p>\n<p>You also could run other fundraisers, for <a href=\"https://community.givingtuesday.org/page/faq\">Giving Tuesday</a>, or for Christmas. If you make the fundraiser look compelling and promote it heavily -- and don&apos;t run too many fundraisers in any given year -- you should come out with a good amount of money moved to good charities and awareness to boot!</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/birthday-fundraisers.html\">How to run an EA fundraiser for your birthday</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><br></h2>\n<h2>Join or Start a Local Meetup Group</h2>\n<p>Another way to engage people is to join or create a local meetup group. The meetup group could be about effective altruism, but it also could be about something related, like skepticism. You probably could even find traction in vegetarian groups or humanist groups or religious groups. Just try it out! Joining a pre-existing meetup is lower cost and gives you the benefit of connecting with an already existing group, but don&apos;t be dissuaded from starting your own -- <a href=\"http://lesswrong.com/lw/43s/starting_a_lw_meetup_is_easy/\">starting a LessWrong (or any other kind of) meetup is easy</a>!</p>\n<p><strong>Resources for Joining a Pre-existing Meetup</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Less_Wrong_meetup_groups\">List of LessWrong Meetups</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/\">Meetup.com</a> is a great way to find meetups -- for example, search for &quot;skeptic&quot; or &quot;vegetarian&quot;. Keep in mind that even if you don&apos;t find a good meetup right away, by staying subscribed to email updates, you could still stumble upon something.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Ask around.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Resources for Starting Your Own Meetup</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/a/peterhurford.com/document/d/1cMyRqIwnPB_dBCEOkcueF2aQ67q9VbOPpY-JJzsLq3A/edit\">How to Hold an Effective Altruist Meetup (Ideas from Multiple People)</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://wiki.lesswrong.com/mediawiki/images/c/ca/How_to_Run_a_Successful_Less_Wrong_Meetup_Group.pdf\">How to Run a Successful LessWrong Meetup</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><br></h2>\n<h2>Try Vegetarianism (or Veganism!) for a Week</h2>\n<p>Another easy way to make a difference is to eat less meat. Every day, millions of nonhuman animals suffer in factory farms, and <a href=\"http://everydayutilitarian.com/essays/why-eat-less-meat/\">by eating less meat, we can help end this suffering</a>. Going vegan -- or vegetarian, or even simply eating less meat -- may seem hard at first, but it&apos;s really not difficult at all, and there are lots of delicious vegetarian options. Give it a try for a week and see how it goes! Consider <a href=\"http://www.mercyforanimals.org/vegan-starter-kit.aspx\">ordering a vegetarian starter kit</a>!</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://tryveg.com/\">Try Veg</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://7dayvegan.com/\">7 Day Vegan</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><br></h2>\n<h2>Volunteer</h2>\n<p>And, if you have some extra time, a lot of effective altruist organizations need some help. <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a> and <a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/\">Animal Charity Evaluators</a> could both use some help. Additionally, there is an organization .impact and coordinates a lot of volunteer work toward EA, including the creation of this forum.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/volunteer-or-work-us\">Giving What We Can&apos;s volunteer page</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://impact.hackpad.com/Projects-aRiPtncmuKS\">.impact&apos;s projects</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/dotimpact/\">.impact&apos;s Facebook group</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><br></h2>\n<h2>Donate More</h2>\n<p>Lastly, even if you&apos;re donating money effectively, you might be able to donate more and increase your impact! If you have a full-time job, chances are you already have more money than you&apos;d ever need to live a happy life. <a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-11950843\">Toby Ord lives a fulfilling life on just &#xA3;18,000 per year</a>, donating the rest to charity. <a href=\"http://www.givinggladly.com/2013/06/whats-it-like-to-give-half.html\">Julia Wise and Jeff Kaufman live a fulfilling life -- with a baby! -- even while donating half their pre-tax income</a>. The <a href=\"http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/02/22/getting-rich-from-zero-to-hero-in-one-blog-post/\">secrets to living a frugal life are not hard</a>, and your life will be even more fulfilling than it was before. In fact, scientific research has demonstrated that <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/giving-and-happiness\">empowering worthy causes with your money is one of the best ways to become happier</a>!</p>\n<p>You certainly don&apos;t have to donate half your money to do <em>something</em>. <strong>Try starting with 1% and increase from there.</strong> One couple, Chris and Madeleine Ball donated 1% of their income on the first year of their marriage and then increased by 1% every year, <a href=\"http://blog.printf.net/articles/2013/12/31/eight-years-and-eight-percent-always-giving-more/\">gradually building up to 8%</a> . They&apos;re still going strong.</p>\n<p>If you think you&apos;re ready to make a sizable and worthwhile commitment, <strong>consider joining <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\">Giving What We Can</a>, an international society of people pledging 10% of their income</strong>. It may seem daunting at first, but <strong>574</strong> people have already joined and many -- including me :) -- would attest it was one of the best decisions they ever made!</p>\n<p>If you are undecided about which organization is currently the best to fund (and live in the US), you might consider setting up a <a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/192-how-to-create-a-donor-advised-fund\">Donor Advised Fund</a>, which has the commitment and tax deduction advantages of donating without actually deciding which charity to donate to at the time.&#xA0; And if you can&apos;t donate more than the minimum needed to itemize your taxes (roughly $5,000 a year), you can <a href=\"http://www.benkuhn.net/bunching\">bunch your donations</a>by donating every other year or so.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.mrmoneymustache.com/\">Mr. Money Mustache</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://yboris.com/why.php\">Why Give?</a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://yboris.com/frugal.php\">Frugal Living Tips: Saving Without Sacrifice</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/join\">The Giving What We Can Pledge</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/try-giving\">Try Out Giving</a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div>-</div>\n<div><br></div>\n<div><em>This post was originally written from notes brainstormed by .impact people, and has had additions by various other EAs during it&apos;s time on&#xA0;<a href=\"http://effective-altruism.wikia.com/wiki/What_small_things_can_an_EA_do\">the EA Wiki</a>. &#xA0;I&apos;ve thought it fitting to repost here.</em></div></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Peter_Hurford"}}, {"_id": "K8eAjG7uuSHaeHnRL", "title": "Meetup : GWWC Glasgow: first meeting/social", "postedAt": "2014-09-14T11:54:41.593Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><h2>Discussion article for the meetup : <a href=\"/meetups/a\">GWWC Glasgow: first meeting/social</a></h2>\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHEN:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>24 September 2014 07:00:00PM (+0100)</span><br>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHERE:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>Queen Margaret Union 22 University Gardens, G12 8QN Glasgow, United Kingdom</span>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t  </div><!-- .meta -->\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t    <div><p>We will have our first meeting of the year quite soon!

If you offered the two of them some magic option that would restore exactly one of them to full health, they would probably be able to agree on who should get it. But in general, how should we compare across people to figure out whose situation is worse, who would benefit more from treatment and who, everything else being equal, should be treated first? This example was easy because the difference was nice and large, but what do we do in harder cases?</p>\n<p>One is to ask people questions like &quot;if there were a surgery that could restore you to full health (without improving your lifespan) but had a 20% chance of killing you, would you take it?&quot; If they say &quot;yes&quot; then this indicates that this disability, for this person, is more than 20% as bad as being dead. Ask these &quot;standard gamble&quot; questions to a lot of people with a lot of disabilities, varying the percentages, and you could build up a list of how bad different ones are, all on a common scale.</p>\n<p>This would useful for balancing projects against each other, figuring out what to focus on, and generally setting funding priorities. Unfortunately people are really bad at answering questions like this. Mostly we&apos;re just bad at thinking about percentages and chances of bad things happening, but you also wonder about the problems of asking someone with, say, &quot;Schizophrenia: acute state&quot; to answer this sort of question.</p>\n<p>You could fix this by asking people about &quot;time tradeoffs&quot;. For example, you could ask someone with a disability about whether they would take a medicine that would restore them to full health for a year even if it took two years off their life. Alternatively you can ask people, generally public health professionals, if given the choice between curing 1000 people with disability X and 2000 people with disability Y which one they would choose. These &quot;person tradeoffs&quot; get us out of needing to ask about probabilities, which means we can probably trust the numbers more, but we&apos;re stuck either with collecting data from people with the disabilities in question (hard work, maybe the disability affects mental function) or trusting that public health experts fully understand what it&apos;s like to have different disabilities (seems unlikely). And even if we did decide that we were only going to collect data from people actually affected by a disability, remember that in many cases they can&apos;t actually give the comparison we want because they haven&apos;t experienced both having and not having the disability (ex: blindness from birth).</p>\n<p>The first Global Burden of Disease Report (<a href=\"http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/1996/0965546608_eng.pdf\">pdf</a>) attempted to collect these weights for a large number of different diseases. They got a panel of public health experts to come to Geneva and through discussion around &quot;person tradeoffs&quot; came to consensus first on weights for 22 &quot;indicator diseases&quot;. Then they agreed on weights for the several hundred remaining diseases by comparing them to these anchor conditions.</p>\n<p>You might worry that the final weights would be really strongly affected by the particular consensus the Geneva group happened to get for the 22 anchors, but they ran nine other attempts with different experts and the average of those attempts correlates pretty well with the Geneva results:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/disability-weights-indicator-conditions-1990.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>For the 2010 update to the Global Burden of Disease weights (<a href=\"http://www.jefftk.com/gbdweights2010.pdf\">pdf</a>, also see the appendix <a href=\"https://profiles.uonbi.ac.ke/odundo_paul/files/common_values_in_assessing_health_outcomes.pdf\">pdf</a>) they decided to take an entirely different approach. Instead of asking experts to figure out tradeoffs they asked lots of people in several countries (Indonesia, Peru, USA, Bangladesh, Tanzania, plus a &apos;global&apos; internet survey) to do lots of comparisons where given two people they would say which one was healthier. This makes a lot of sense, asking lots of regular people, and the question is much simpler to answer. On the other hand, while I&apos;m not sure experts are all that good at estimating how bad it is to have various disabilities I would expect regular people to be even worse at it. Still, there was at least pretty good correlation between countries:</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/disability-weights-2010-by-country-2x.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>But hold on: how did they turn a large number of responses where people said one disability was more or less healthy than another into weightings on a 0-1 scale where 0 is full health and 1 is death? It turns out that a quarter (n=4000) of the people who took the survey on the internet were also asked the &quot;person tradeoff&quot; style questions used in the 1990 version, which they called &quot;population health equivalence questions&quot;. So they first determined an ordering from most to least healthy using their large quantity of comparison data, and then used the tradeoff data to map this ordering onto the &quot;0=healthy 1=death&quot; line.</p>\n<p>This means that when we look at the cross-country correlations above we&apos;re only seeing their agreement on the relative ordering of conditions, not on the absolute differences. If people in Indonesia on average think that the worst disabilities are only 10% as bad as being dead while people in Peru think they&apos;re 90% as bad, this wouldn&apos;t keep them from having perfect correlation on a chart like this. Which is kind of a problem, because we need more than an ordering for prioritization.</p>\n<p>It turns out that this method of estimation actually gives pretty different results from the one used in the earlier version: [1]</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://www.jefftk.com/disability-weights-expert-vs-lay.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Yes, there&apos;s a correlation, but it&apos;s pretty weak. And it&apos;s probably not just about the fifteen years between when most of the first estimates were made and when most of the second were; these aren&apos;t disabilities that are quickly changing. This indicates that what we&apos;re trying to measure is just not that well captured by the measurements we&apos;re making.</p>\n<p>So, a summary. Getting good answers means asking people questions they&apos;re not good at thinking about, or that they are good at thinking about but don&apos;t have the right experience to be able to answer. It&apos;s not too surprising, then, that the answers you get via different methods don&apos;t agree very well. We do still need a rough way to say &quot;benefit X to N people is better/worse than benefit Y to M people&quot;, but trying to do this in the general case doesn&apos;t seem to have worked out very well.</p>\n<p>These disability weights are only one step in estimating $/DALY for various interventions, and the messiness here is in some ways much less than the messiness in the other steps. After reading about how these estimates came to be, I&apos;m pretty glad GiveWell <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/11/04/some-considerations-against-more-investment-in-cost-effectiveness-estimates/\">doesn&apos;t put much trust in them</a> in figuring out which charities to recommend:</p>\n<blockquote>The resources that have already been invested in these cost-effectiveness estimates are significant. Yet in our view, the estimates are still far too simplified, sensitive, and esoteric to be relied upon. If such a high level of financial and (especially) human-capital investment leaves us this far from having reliable estimates, it may be time to rethink the goal.\n<p>All that said&#x2014;if this sort of analysis were the only way to figure out how to allocate resources for maximal impact, we&apos;d be advocating for more investment in cost-effectiveness analysis and we&apos;d be determined to &quot;get it right&quot;. But in our view, there are other ways of maximizing cost-effectiveness that can work better in this domain&#x2014;in particular, making limited use of cost-effectiveness estimates while focusing on finding high-quality evidence.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This isn&apos;t to say we should never use disability weights; even if they were just made up by one guy on the spot (and they&apos;re better than that) this <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/05/02/if-its-worth-doing-its-worth-doing-with-made-up-statistics/\">would probably</a> still be better in some cases than refusing to make quantitative comparisons at all. Getting rough numbers like this is especially useful for avoiding scope insensitivity problems, where you might be comparing a large number of people with something minor against a small number with something major.</p>\n<p>(I&apos;d really like to look into the QALY numbers people use and how they get them. I believe the process is similar, but I&apos;m not too sure.)</p>\n<p>For curiosity, however, and with all that in mind, what are the actual numbers they found?

and tested the waters on a range of policies we thought might have significant positive benefits for the world.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>In most cases we quickly found that they could not currently attract political support, for various reasons.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Here we discuss two more we investigated in greater detail. These were both aimed at improving the depth of knowledge of policymakers about risks from new and upcoming technologies.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>These turned out to be premature, as they were policies to deal with issues about which there is no academic consensus on the nature of the problem, let alone the appropriate response. More groundwork needs to be done before there will be majority support for significant policy changes in these areas.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Nonetheless we had successes in raising the profile of unprecedented technological risks in Government via a report we wrote which was widely circulated through several departments and read by senior civil servants, advisors, and politicians. &nbsp;We were also invited to contribute a chapter on existential risk to the Government Chief Scientist\u2019s Annual Report. &nbsp;</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><span>Cross-posted from the </span><a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/research/global-priorities-project/\"><span>Global Priorities Project</span></a></h2>\n<h2><span>Introduction</span></h2>\n<p><span>During the past year the Centre for Effective Altruism has been engaged in ongoing policy discussions with policymakers in the UK Government. &nbsp;We generated hundreds of policy options and had many meetings with policymakers within the UK Government, both party political advisors, politicians and civil servants. &nbsp;This post describes some of our learnings from this process. &nbsp;These learnings will probably be obvious to anyone with experience of the policy-making process, but I hope that discussing them in more detail will be useful for people less familiar with policy making who attempt to do policy work going forwards. &nbsp;This work was primarily carried out by Toby Ord, Nick Beckstead, William MacAskill, Owen Cotton-Barratt, Robert Wiblin, Haydn Belfield, and myself. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>One of our motivations for engaging in this work is that developed countries\u2019 governments typically control budgets of the order of a trillion $US ($10^12</span><span>) per year, and so moving a small portion of this budget could result in large amounts of money moved to effective causes. &nbsp;Paul Christiano discusses the potential value of engaging in politics in more detail </span><a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/310-an-estimate-of-the-expected-influence-of-becoming-a-politician\"><span>here</span></a><span>. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Over the past year we have devised many outlines for possible policies which aimed to, among other things, reduce poverty, reduce animal suffering, improve decision making, improve scientific progress, or reduce extinction risk. &nbsp;The policymakers thought that many of these policies were promising or interesting, but weren\u2019t excited enough about any specific initiatives to really push for them. &nbsp;The overwhelming majority of the proposals that we presented were set aside by policymakers without further investigation. &nbsp;Most of those initiatives that were investigated further had problems associated with them, did not provide the benefits that we were initially hoping for, or simply weren\u2019t promising enough for the policymakers to push for them publicly. &nbsp;While we will not be making the full list public at this time, there are a number of themes that emerged from the policies that were not taken up. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span>Political feasibility</span></h2>\n<p><span>The most common reason for policies to be rejected was because they were politically infeasible. &nbsp;We realised that the initiatives that were most likely to progress were those that would incur little to no financial or political cost to the politicians. &nbsp;It may be possible to overcome the preference for zero or low financial and political cost by building supporting coalitions, but I will save the discussion for </span><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ySbMVhkxZx6ot--gluvjzueD3yImhhgJkuQ8iaUR7_c/edit#heading=h.8y6krcxk29wt\"><span>later is this post</span></a><span>. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span>Financial cost</span></h3>\n<p><span>Many of the policies and initiatives we suggested were rejected because they would cost Government money. &nbsp;Policies ruled out for this reason included:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Funding research to </span><a href=\"http://files.givewell.org/files/conversations/Tetlock%202-12-14%20(public).pdf\"><span>improve forecasting</span></a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Increasing funding for research into </span><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Global-Catastrophic-Risks-Nick-Bostrom/dp/0199606501\"><span>global catastrophic risks</span></a></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Others were rejected because they would cost some voters money, even if they would save more money for others. &nbsp;Policies ruled out for this reason included:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Taxing all non-free-range meat products</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Stopping subsidies of certain agricultural products</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3><span>Political cost</span></h3>\n<p><span>Many policies were ruled out because of the political, financial and time opportunity cost. &nbsp;One way of conceiving of this objection is that the policymakers were unwilling to spend </span><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_capital\"><span>political capital</span></a><span> because they had more promising ways in which to spend their time and money.</span><span> &nbsp;This could be because the policy was weird, unpopular, or could be blocked by special interest groups. &nbsp;Policies that were ruled out for these reasons include:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Creating more </span><a href=\"/ea/5r/improving_disaster_shelters_to_increase_the/\"><span>disaster shelters</span></a><span> to protect against global catastrophic risks (too weird)</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Increasing immigration via various mechanisms (too unpopular)</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Setting minimum sizes for gestation crates for pigs (could be blocked by special interests)</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<div>\n<table>\n<colgroup><col></colgroup> \n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<h4><span>Box 1: Over-simplistic policy analysis (or \u2018why some scientists are bad at policy\u2019)</span></h4>\n<p><span>During my years as a climate scientist and campaigner, I had many opportunities to see scientists attempting to engage in policy poorly. &nbsp;I would often see scientists:</span></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><span>Identify a problem, e.g. climate change due to increasing EU road transport CO</span><span>2</span><span> emissions</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Identify a possible response, e.g. reduce EU road transport emissions</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Identify a possible policy, e.g. require some fraction of EU petrol to come from EU biofuels</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Promote this policy</span></p>\n</li>\n</ol><br>\n<p><span>One of the problems with this approach is that the scientists have not engaged in policy analysis, for example by</span><span>:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Identifying all of the other possible policy responses,</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Defining our aims, not just in the specific area the policy is addressing, but also in terms of limiting other potentially negative consequences of the policy,</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Estimating how well these possible policies achieve our aims,</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>And assessing the trade-offs between the policies to identify the best policy. &nbsp;</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><span>Another problem is that they have not analysed the political landscape or initiated stakeholder engagement, for example by:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><span>Speaking with different stakeholders to determine how much support and opposition there is for these different policies</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Considered tweaking the policy in a number of ways to bring potential allies on board and neutralise potential opponents</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Used tools such as power matrices to estimate whether it would be possible to build a coalition influential enough to push any of these policies through to implementation. &nbsp;</span></p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n<p><span>By moving straight from step three to four above we ignore key aspects of the policy-making process and end up promoting policies that are usually sub-optimal from an efficiency perspective, and are also politically infeasible. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>One way in which scientists can engage with the political process successfully is by proposing their policy and \u2018passing the baton\u2019 on to policy analysts who can then compare it to the other policies on the table. &nbsp;But the scientist should not be surprised if their policy turns out to be sub-optimal or politically infeasible. &nbsp;Indeed this is probably the most likely outcome for a policy that has been proposed by someone who is not an expert in this policy area. &nbsp;However if the policy analyst is in favour of the idea, a powerful partnership can develop in which the scientist acts as a scientific advisor to an ongoing policy development process. &nbsp;One example of this occurring is the role that Dr. Drew Shindell played in the development of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, which was largely developed by the US State Department with Dr. Shindell acting as a scientific advisor to the process. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>Note that Kingdon\u2019s </span><a href=\"http://www.fsu.edu/~pea/Multiple_Streams.html\"><span>\u2018multiple streams\u2019</span></a><span> model of policy change suggests that </span><a href=\"http://ww2.publicpolicy.utoronto.ca/ppgr/PPGGlossary/PQ/PolicyWindow/Pages/default.aspx\"><span>\u2018policy windows\u2019</span></a><span> caused by the shifting political landscape could allow previously-rejected policies to be implemented. &nbsp;Under this model a scientist who is unable to tell when a policy window has opened could have success in continuously promoting policy over a long period of time and hoping that at some point a policy window may open. &nbsp;An example of where this may have occurred is in the story that is told about the creation of an observational program to monitor ocean currents in the North Atlantic. &nbsp;These measurements had been desired by the scientific community for some time, but according to this story it was not until a scientist mentioned the problem of a potential slow-down in the ocean currents and the need to monitor them to then UK Prime Minister Tony Blair that funding became available for the programme. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>A potentially more effective option for the scientists pushing for their policy continuously would be for them to ally with a policy analyst with more expertise in analysing the political landscape, who could monitor the landscape and report back to the scientist if a policy window opens or has a chance of opening soon. &nbsp;This may have been the case with the Climate and Clean Air Coalition, which some commentators said was Obama\u2019s attempt to claim a success in tackling climate change in the run up to the 2012 general election in order to woo back environmental voters who had been unimpressed by his record on climate change to date. &nbsp;This policy window may have caused policy analysts at the State Department to implement Dr. Shindell, and others\u2019 long-standing policy recommendations. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<br>\n<p><span>There is plenty more work that needs doing in identifying possible responses to problems that effective altruism community has identified (i.e. in step two above), before the community can focus the majority of its efforts on proposing policies (see step three). &nbsp;However, if the effective altruism community would like to do some of this policy analysis, political landscape analysis and stakeholder engagement itself rather than relying on busy and potentially disinterested policy analysts and campaign strategists, we will need to develop expertise in these areas. &nbsp;</span></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<h2><span>More initiatives that won\u2019t work (yet)</span></h2>\n<p><span>Once the majority of our proposals had been ruled out due to not being clearly politically feasible, we had a much smaller number of options to investigate further. &nbsp;Of these, several failed because they were too advanced relative to our current understanding, and required a majority to support them. &nbsp;I discuss two examples in more detail below. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span>An Intergovernmental Panel on Biotechnological Risk</span></h3>\n<h4><span>The proposal</span></h4>\n<p><span>Set up a body, modelled on to the </span><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intergovernmental_Panel_on_Climate_Change\"><span>Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change</span></a><span> (IPCC), to synthesise knowledge on biotechnological risks. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<h4><span>The appeal</span></h4>\n<p><span>The IPCC had a huge impact on the climate change debate, and even won a Nobel peace prize </span><span>\"for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change\"</span><span>. &nbsp;Presumably an Intergovernmental Panel on Biotechnological Risk could do the same for biotechnological risk? &nbsp;</span></p>\n<h4><span>The stumbling blocks</span></h4>\n<p><span>The IPCC was set up by the scientific community to illustrate to the world that there was a scientific consensus on climate change. &nbsp;The IPCC does not do original research, and does not progress the field other than by recording the state of climate science research every six or seven years. &nbsp;The consensus in the field on what to do about the risks arising from biotechnology is not as uniform as the state of climate science was when the IPCC was set up.</span><span> &nbsp;There are still a wide range of views on questions such as whether certain types of potentially dangerous research should be undertaken, and whether creating novel dangerous pathogens in the lab is overall a net harm. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>My understanding from </span><a href=\"http://cisac.stanford.edu/people/stephen_j_stedman/\"><span>Prof. Steve Stedman</span></a><span>, former Assistant Secretary General to the United Nations, is that he spoke with over fifty experts about the question of setting up an IPCC-equivalent body in this area and concluded that there were neither high-level experts willing to champion the initiative, nor was there a general feeling that the initiative would succeed, in part due to the lack of consensus.</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>IPCC authors are not paid for their time, and so they either volunteer their time, or use funding from other grants to cover their costs. &nbsp;This aspect also made the initiative unappealing to potential champions of the initiative. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Another problem is that the incentives are aligned rather differently. &nbsp;When climate scientists raised the alarm about climate change, it did not curtail their research freedom, and increased the future funding to climate science. &nbsp;If biotechnologists raise the alarm about biotech risk, their proposals will largely be imposing restrictions or large costs on their own and their peers\u2019 research. &nbsp;Additionally, the overall effect may well be to reduce the total amount of funding to their area, though this is uncertain. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Prof. Stedman conducted the most in depth investigation to date of the possibility of setting up an IPCC for biotechnology risk. &nbsp;He was convinced enough that it was unlikely to go ahead that after his investigation he returned the remainder of the funding that he had been given to set up the initiative and moved on to other things. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span>House of Commons/Lords Science and Technology Committee inquiry into unprecedented technological risk</span></h3>\n<h4><span>The proposal</span></h4>\n<p><span>The House of Commons/Lords Science and Technology Committee would run an inquiry into unprecedented technological risk, particularly focusing on its impact on existential risk. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<h4><span>The appeal</span></h4>\n<p><span>The Government must respond in writing to the committee\u2019s reports, and this could allow the committee to influence government policy on this issue. &nbsp;We also hoped that we could use this as a way to cause people to investigate this issue and develop possible responses. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p>\n<h4><span>The stumbling blocks</span></h4>\n<p><span>House of Commons/Lords committees such as this one cannot do original research, and largely synthesise the views of the witnesses that they call on. &nbsp;As there has been little research done into policy responses to existential risk, and there is no consensus in the area, it is unlikely that the committee would make strong recommendations to Government. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Additionally, in order to launch the inquiry we would need multiple sympathetic MPs or Lords on the committee. &nbsp;The inquiry would need to be led by a particularly sympathetic member, and it would take up a large amount of their time. &nbsp;This is time that could otherwise be put to potentially more useful initiatives. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>This may be a useful initiative to take up in future when there has been more research done into responses to unprecedented technological risks and their impact on existential risk, particularly once those responses have been developed into prioritised policy proposals. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span>Communicating expert opinion</span></h3>\n<p><span>Both of these failed proposals are about communicating the majority view of experts to decision-makers and interested parties. &nbsp;The reason they failed is because the field of existential risk reduction is so new that the majority of experts do not yet hold similar views on the issue. &nbsp;For example, even within the </span><a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/\"><span>Future of Humanity Institute</span></a><span> there is significant internal disagreement on key elements of what we should be doing to reduce existential risk. &nbsp;This suggests there is much more research to be done in this area before we can start implementing many of our possible responses. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span>The rational model of policy analysis</span></h2>\n<p><span>There are </span><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Lobbying-Policy-Change-Wins-Loses/dp/0226039455\"><span>many models</span></a><span> of the policy-making process. &nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elmer_Eric_Schattschneider\"><span>Schattschneider\u2019s</span></a><span> </span><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/The-Semi-Sovereign-People-Realists-Democracy/dp/0030133661\"><span>\u2018expansion of conflict\u2019</span></a><span> model suggests that the policy-making process is largely determined by the extent to which parties are able to expand the process to include additional groups that are supportive of their point of view. &nbsp;One of the more popular models is </span><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_W._Kingdon\"><span>Kingdon\u2019s</span></a><span> </span><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Alternatives-Policies-Epilogue-Classics-Political/dp/020500086X\"><span>\u201cmultiple streams\u201d model</span></a><span>, which suggests that policies are only implemented when \u2018problems, policies and politics\u2019 align to create a window of opportunity. &nbsp;Kingdon also introduces the idea of a </span><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_entrepreneur\"><span>\u2018policy entrepreneur\u2019</span></a><span> as someone who seeks to gain benefits in exchange for implementing policies and initiatives that are popular. &nbsp;Baumgartner and Jones </span><a href=\"http://www.amazon.co.uk/Agendas-Instability-American-Politics-Political/dp/0226039390\"><span>focus</span></a><span> on issue-definition and venue-shopping to suggest that issues usually follow a stable policy direction but that this stability is interjected with periods of rapid, unpredictable change. &nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Policy-Design-Democracy-Larason-Schneider/dp/0700608443\"><span>Schneider, Ingram</span></a><span>, </span><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Policy-Paradox-Political-Decision-Making/dp/0393976254\"><span>Stone</span></a><span> and others focus on issue framing as the factor which decides which policies are implemented and which are not. &nbsp;These are just a small subset of the more popular models of the policymaking process which have been proposed. &nbsp;These models cover different aspects of the decision-making process, and do not always agree where they overlap, as we might expect in a real-world process as complex as this one. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon\"><span>Simon\u2019s</span></a><span> </span><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policy_analysis#Rational_model\"><span>rational model</span></a><span> of policy analysis is another model that we can use to frame our discussion of the policymaking process. &nbsp;It is a simple model that I will discuss in more detail is I believe it can be used to illustrate the broader picture of why many of our policies were not taken up. &nbsp;It was originally put forward by </span><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon\"><span>Herbert A. Simon</span></a><span> to describe a process one could take to develop public policy. &nbsp;Below is an adaptation of </span><a href=\"http://books.google.com/books/about/Environmental_Policy.html?id=QXkNGwWkF10C\"><span>Ian Thomas</span></a><span>\u2019s description of </span><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herbert_A._Simon\"><span>Simon</span></a><span>\u2019s model of policy development: </span></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><span>Intelligence gathering\u2014 data and potential problems and opportunities are identified, collected and analyzed.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Identifying a problem</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Identifying options to solve this problem</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Assessing the consequences of all options</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Relating consequences to values\u2014 with all decisions and policies there will be a set of values which will be more relevant (for example, economic feasibility and environmental protection) and which can be expressed as a set of criteria, against which performance (or consequences) of each option can be judged.</span></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><span>Choosing the preferred option\u2014 given the full understanding of all the problems and opportunities, all the consequences and the criteria for judging options. &nbsp;</span></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Stages in the model can occur concurrently and stages can be skipped. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span>Criticism of the rational model</span></h3>\n<p><span>Like any simple model, the \u2018rational model\u2019 ignores some important factors. &nbsp;For example, it ignores the political landscape and vested interests, and assumes the Government is a unitary rational actor in a static system</span><span>. &nbsp;There is a literature of case studies both showing </span><a

of the rational model in different circumstances. &nbsp;Nonetheless it can be helpful to us in providing a hypothesis as to why our policies were unworkable, and where we might focus our attention in the future. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span>An adapted rational model</span></h3>\n<p><span>The rational model has been adapted in a </span><a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168851096008895\"><span>number</span></a><span> </span><a href=\"http://www.msu.edu/course/prr/389/Pattonsawicki.doc\"><span>of</span></a><span> </span><a href=\"http://www.minneapolisfed.org/research/qr/qr1011.pdf\"><span>ways</span></a><span> throughout the </span><a href=\"http://cursodeposgrado.files.wordpress.com/2011/08/libro-sabatier.pdf\"><span>literature</span></a><span>. &nbsp;Here I suggest an extension that may help explain some of our experience. &nbsp;As with all models based on the rational model, it will have a number of shortfalls, but is hopefully still useful. &nbsp;It proposes that policy development largely goes through the following stages:</span></p>\n<p><span><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1667995874/mirroredImages/n5CNeo9jxDsCit9dj/lcdwczwzau59nzyg3pz2.png\" alt=\"\"></span></p>\n<p><span>Like in the original rational model, stages can occur concurrently and stages can be skipped. &nbsp;I make a distinction between responses (desired outcomes, e.g. reduce emissions), and policies (methods of achieving the desired outcomes, e.g. a cap and trade regime) as I did in the box</span><span> above. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>We can represent our progress towards a policy-based solution for a given problem in this model. &nbsp;For example, on existential risk due to artificial intelligence, the community is perhaps working on gathering intelligence and identifying the problem (stages 1 and 2A), with limited work on identifying responses and building coalitions around the problem (stages 3A and 2B). &nbsp;Thus it would not be as useful for the community to shift its attention to working on stages 4A, 3B, 4B or 5 at this point. &nbsp;There may be space for individuals to do pioneering work in these areas, but in general the model would suggest that they will find progress easier once more progress has been made in the previous stages. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>On climate change mitigation (reducing greenhouse gas emissions) in the UK, most of the work that remains to be done is on developing policies, building coalitions around various responses and policies and attempting get those policies implemented (stages 4A, 3B, 4B and 5). &nbsp;This is one of the reasons I moved away from being a climate scientist, where I was predominantly working on stage one. &nbsp;This is not to say that there is no more work to be done in this area; further highlighting the dangers from climate change is still useful, just perhaps not as useful as well-directed work in the policy arena. &nbsp;In the US, it is plausible that the coalitions around the problem (stage 2B) are not yet strong enough, and so there is potentially more work to be done there. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>We can view the intergovernmental panel on biotechnological risk as an attempt to build a coalition around responses to biotech risk once we had a coalition in place around the problem of biotech risk (moving from stage 2B to stage 3B). &nbsp;The problem in this case was that there was not a pre-existing coalition developed around the problem large enough to represent the majority view. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>We investigated using the House of Commons/Lords Select Committee to do response identification, policy identification, and advocacy (stages 3A onwards), however the committees are unable to carry out response and policy identification (stages 3A and 4A) as these are not within the Committees\u2019 mandates. &nbsp;Indeed I cannot think of any examples of Government committees that do this form of response and policy research, except perhaps in extreme circumstances such as during times of crisis. We should perhaps view the Commons/Lords Committees as part of moving from a coalition around a specific policy to getting that policy implemented (moving from stage 4B to stage 5). &nbsp;We are not yet ready for this stage as policies and coalitions around responses (stages 4A and 3B) have not been adequately developed, let alone coalitions around policies (stage 4B). &nbsp;</span></p>\n<h3><span>Criticisms</span></h3>\n<p><span>There are many ways that this model may mislead us, particularly if it is followed in too formulaic a fashion. &nbsp;I will list just some of these criticisms below. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>For example, by building visible coalitions we can also ignite opposition, and so need to be wary of the political landscape in order to improve the chances of our activities have an overall positive effect. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>This model could also cause us to miss easy wins, in which the size of the coalition required to cause the policy to be implemented is surprisingly small, if we were focusing attention on earlier stages in the model. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>This model doesn\u2019t properly incorporate the possibility of larger-scale political change (such as a change of party after an election), nor does it account for external events (such as a war or various types of disaster) that can dramatically alter coalitions and the thresholds required for policy implementation. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Additionally, by simply modelling \u2018coalitions\u2019 the model ignores the different roles played by different actors such as the media, the public, interest groups, political elites, and others in the process. &nbsp;A more fine grained model of the political landscape and stakeholder engagement will be useful in the later stages of the model. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>So this is a simplistic model, yet it allows us to make hypotheses about where further work may be most useful to help move towards policy solutions to problems. &nbsp;These hypotheses can then be probed further using other methods. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<h2><span>Outcomes and next steps</span></h2>\n<p><span>Over the course of our policy engagement to date we have learned much, and also had some significant successes. &nbsp;Our report on unprecedented technological risks was widely distributed and read by politicians and civil servants across a number of departments. &nbsp;We were also invited to contribute a chapter on existential risk to the UK Government Chief Scientist\u2019s Annual Report on risk. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>Going forwards, we have decided to focus more of our effort on building coalitions around the problem and identifying solutions (stages 2B and 3A). &nbsp;One of the reasons for this is that we found it easier than expected to gain access to policymakers, and thus when we have more politically feasible responses to problems and more support for them, we think it will be possible for us to take these to policymakers. &nbsp;Nonetheless, we will continue to respond to policy opportunities in a more reactive fashion, and will continue to meet with senior policymakers and politicians as opportunities arise. &nbsp;</span></p>\n<p><strong><br></strong></p>\n<p><span>This work was carried out by the Global Priorities Project, which is currently fundraising to hire an additional researcher for the project and a full-time project manager who will also lead our outreach to Governments and foundations. &nbsp;If you would be interested in contributing to this effort please </span><a href=\"mailto:niel.bowerman@centreforeffectivelaltruism.org\"><span>contact me</span></a><span> or </span><a href=\"mailto:robert.wiblin@centreforeffectivelaltruism.org\"><span>Robert Wiblin</span></a><span>.

Historically, it comes from Greek roots meaning &#x201C;world&#x201D; and &#x201C;city,&#x201D; and is associated with Diogenes of Sinope&#x2019;s (c. 404-323 BC) declaration that he was a &#x201C;citizen of the world.&#x201D; Without the metaphors of world-cities or citizenship, I mean by &#x201C;cosmopolitanism&#x201D; a moral and political stance that gives the interests of people of other nationalities a weight equal (or at least nearly equal) to those of one&#x2019;s compatriots.</p>\n<p>Support for cosmopolitanism among effective altruists is, as far as I can tell, unanimous. There is no wing of the effective altruist movement exclusively focused on fighting poverty in the US, for example. But effective altruists don&#x2019;t talk about cosmopolitanism much. When they do, they call it&#xA0;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_altruism#Impartiality\">&#x201C;impartiality,&#x201D;</a> which is too vague. Judges, juries, journalists, and so on (to limit myself to the &#x201C;j&#x201D;s) are expected to be impartial in a sense, but only in specific domains. Cosmopolitanism&#x2019;s demands are much broader.</p>\n<p>I think effective altruists don&#x2019;t talk about cosmopolitanism more because they take it for granted. Peter Singer, in his influential and now more than forty year old article <a href=\"http://www.utilitarianism.net/singer/by/1972----.htm\">&#x201C;Famine, Affluence, and Morality,&#x201D;</a> devoted only a paragraph to the subject, saying &#x201C;I do not think I need to say much in defense of the refusal to take proximity and distance into account.&#x201D; But there are good reasons to doubt most people are fully on board with cosmopolitanism.</p>\n<p>This is most obvious in politics. Can you imagine a politician advocating free trade on the grounds that, while it might hurt the politician&#x2019;s own country a little, it would have enormous benefits for people living in other countries? Or making the same argument for immigration? In the United States, critics of military intervention tend to focus on the costs in terms of American lives and dollars, and the &#x201C;lack of a compelling national interest.&#x201D; The fact that these interventions often wreak enormous havoc on the countries we bomb and invade can seem to come in as a distant fourth in anti-war rhetoric.</p>\n<p>I suspect this also explains much of why most people aren&#x2019;t more committed to fighting global poverty. People may <em>claim</em><span> to believe, for example, that their donations will just get stolen by corrupt governments, but often this sounds like an excuse. And imagine what would happen if you went beyond praising the cost-effectiveness of anti-malarial bed nets, and told them to direct efforts </span><em>away</em><span> from specific local causes they support. In response, they probably wouldn&#x2019;t </span><em>quite</em><span> tell you they care about geographic neighbors more than foreigners, but you might hear a little speech about the importance of responsibility towards your own community.</span></p>\n<p>There&#x2019;s a paradox here. The label &#x201C;anti-foreign&#x201D; has <em>some</em> negative connotations, but it&#x2019;s not really taboo in the way racism is. This is in spite of favoritism based on place of birth being no less arbitrary than favoritism based on skin color. In America, there&#x2019;s a notorious anti-immigration blogger named Steve Sailer who&#x2019;s often accused of racism. I&#x2019;ve looked at Sailer&#x2019;s writings, and concluded that if he&#x2019;s racist, he&#x2019;s much less driven by racism than nativism. Sailer prefers to call it &#x201C;citizenism&#x201D;; Wikipedia <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Sailer#Views_and_criticism\">quotes him</a> as saying, &#x201C;I believe Americans should be biased in favor of the welfare of our current fellow citizens over that of the six billion foreigners.&#x201D; That may <em>sound</em> racist to many people, but it&#x2019;s hard to explain America&#x2019;s current immigration policies without assuming a lot of quiet support for Sailer&#x2019;s views.</p>\n<p>In America, the relative taboo-ness of racism and nativism may be influenced by America&#x2019;s history regarding race. Still, critics of anti-immigrant parties in Europe often seem to go out of their way to criticize those parties as racist, as if it weren&#x2019;t enough to criticize them for being anti-immigrant. It would be nice if people would treat nativism as bad enough in itself, whether or not it&#x2019;s paired with racism.</p>\n<p>So far, I&#x2019;ve just been trying to argue that effective altruists take cosmopolitanism too much for granted, and should more see cosmopolitanism as something distinctive about themselves. I haven&#x2019;t been trying to argue that effective altruists should be actively supporting immigration reform or other cosmopolitan political causes. I don&#x2019;t actually know if it would be worth the effort. I think it would be hugely beneficial if major governments became more cosmopolitan, but making that happen may be a cause that&#x2019;s too crowded and too intractable.</p>\n<p>That said, I&#x2019;m enthusiastic about the <a href=\"http://www.openphilanthropy.org/\">Open Philanthropy Project</a>&#x2019;s research on policy advocacy, because it may lead to finding cost-effective ways to influence government policy in a more cosmopolitan direction. Even if there is not much we can do now directly, explicitly advocating for cosmopolitan ideals may have important long-run benefits. Finally, it can be enlightening to analyze politics through a cosmopolitan lens. It can be depressing, because government policy is so often un-cosmopolitan, but it can also be a source of common ground between superficially different political camps.</p>\n<p>Many criticisms of the standard left-right political axis are well-known. Libertarians like to describe themselves as socially liberal and economically conservative (strangely, few people do the opposite). <a href=\"http://theamericanscene.com/2010/04/26/notes-toward-a-new-political-taxonomy\">Another proposed taxonomy</a> uses three axes: individualist vs. authoritarian, winners vs. losers, and progress vs. decay. But I think cosmopolitanism vs. nationalistic, nativistic, and parochial outlooks is often more a more important axis.</p>\n<p>For instance, I find an enormous amount to like in libertarian writer <a href=\"http://www.bcaplan.com/\">Bryan Caplan</a>. Our disagreements on taxes or consequentialism vs. deontology feel like minor issues compared to his excellent writings on <a href=\"http://econfaculty.gmu.edu/bcaplan/pdfs/whyimmigration.pdf\">immigration</a> and <a href=\"http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2010/04/the_common-sens.html\">war</a>. That&#x2019;s because we&#x2019;re both cosmopolitans. On the other hand, there are parochial libertarians who are much more focused on opposing federal regulations and taxes but don&#x2019;t much mind if the local police bully perceived &#x201C;outsiders.&#x201D; I don&#x2019;t find much common ground with them. But nor do I find much in common with parochial liberals focused on things like the welfare of local middle-class union members.</p>\n<p>I want to say something about religious conservatives here, since they are such an important force in the US (though I know this is not true in all countries). Religion often seems to end up aligned with nationalism, perhaps because religious and national boundaries often coincide. But there&#x2019;s no reason this <em>must</em> be so. Modern religions aspire to cross national boundaries. Many Christian thinkers play up Christianity&#x2019;s cosmopolitan streak&#x2014;to hear them tell it, Christianity invented cosmopolitanism. This isn&#x2019;t true; as already noted cosmopolitanism can be traced back to ancient Greece. By the time Christianity came on the scene, cosmopolitanism had gone mainstream in the Roman world via Stoicism. Nevertheless, Christianity&#x2019;s cosmopolitanism is real: think of the parable of the good Samaritan, or Paul&#x2019;s &#x201C;neither Jew nor Gentile&#x201D; line in Galatians.</p>\n<p>There are a handful of policy issues where the implications of cosmopolitanism seem relatively clear: governments should give the interests of foreigners more weight in decisions that affect them, including immigration, trade, foreign aid, and global environmental issues (including global warming). But rather than say much about those issues, I want to finish this post by talking about a slightly more complicated issue, foreign military intervention.</p>\n<p>The US has been justifying military actions in altruistic terms since at least the Spanish-American War, which was sold partly as defending Cubans from their Spanish oppressor. Other countries have engaged in similar rhetoric. What are we to make of it? Should it be dismissed as obvious propaganda? Or proponents of altruistic intervention deserve to be taken seriously for having the right ideals?</p>\n<p>Philosopher Richard Chappell proposes a useful test here, which he calls <a href=\"http://www.philosophyetc.net/2014/08/the-cosmopolitan-civilian-test-for.html\">the cosmopolitan civilian test for proportionality in war.</a> It asks, &#x201C;Would these civilian casualties be considered &#x2018;proportionate&#x2019; if the civilians in question were of a different nationality?&#x201D; Framed in those terms, I think it is obvious that the answer is all too often &#x201C;no.&#x201D; As Caplan puts it, &#x201C;If a policeman fought crime the way that &#x2018;civilized&#x2019; armies wage war, we&apos;d put him in jail.&#x201D;</p>\n<p>But there may be exceptions, so I think it is important to emphasize the standard, rather than specific applications. Presumably proponents of altruistic intervention would claim the actions they advocate pass the cosmopolitan civilian test. After all, it&#x2019;s not as if interventionists are going to say they place great value on foreigners&#x2019; liberty, but not so much on their lives. Asking proponents of particular interventions to explain how an intervention passes the cosmopolitan civilian test may be a good way to distinguish genuine (if misguided) altruists from people whose real motives are less noble.</p>\n<p>Again, none of this is to say that trying to enact a cosmopolitan policy agenda should necessarily be a top priority for effective altruists. But I think the effective altruist movement would benefit from being more self-conscious about its cosmopolitanism.</p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "TopherHallquist"}}, {"_id": "WL2DMREp4d6M6bwBE", "title": "Meetup : Effective Altruism pub meetup!", "postedAt": "2014-09-10T00:46:29.476Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><h2>Discussion article for the meetup : <a href=\"/meetups/5\">Effective Altruism pub meetup!</a></h2>\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHEN:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>01 October 2014 08:00:00PM (+0100)</span><br>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHERE:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>Bristol, UK</span>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t  </div><!-- .meta -->\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t    <div><p>Meet at the white bear on St Michael&apos;s Hill at 8pm for a chat about doing good and a pint or two.

Those who wish to defend hierarchical, inegalitarian societies have often pointed out that by whatever test we choose it simply is not true that all humans are equal. Like it or not we must face the fact that humans come in different shapes and sizes; they come with different moral capacities, different intellectual abilities, different amounts of benevolent feeling and sensitivity to the needs of others, different abilities to communicate effectively, and different capacities to experience pleasure and pain. In short, if the demand for equality were based on the actual equality of all human beings, we would have to stop demanding equality. Still, one might cling to the view that the demand for equality among human beings is based on the actual equality of the different races and sexes.</p>\n<p>However, there is no need to pin the case for equality to one particular outcome of a scientific investigation. The appropriate response to those who claim to have found evidence of genetically based differences in ability among the races or between the sexes is not to stick to the belief that the genetic explanation must be wrong, whatever evidence to the contrary may turn up; instead we should make it quite clear that the claim to equality does not depend on intelligence, moral capacity, physical strength, or similar matters of fact. Equality is a moral idea, not an assertion of fact. There is no logically compelling reason for assuming that a factual difference in ability between two people justifies any difference in the amount of consideration we give to their needs and interests. The principle of the equality of human beings is not a description of an alleged actual equality among humans: it is a prescription of how we should treat human beings.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Jeremy Bentham, the founder of the reforming utilitarian school of moral philosophy, incorporated the essential basis of moral equality into his system of ethics by means of the formula: \"Each to count for one and none for more than one.\" In other words, the interests of every being affected by an action are to be taken into account and given the same weight as the like interests of any other being...&nbsp;</p>\n<p>It is an implication of this principle of equality that our concern for others and our readiness to consider their interests ought not to depend on what they are like or on what abilities they may possess. Precisely what our concern or consideration requires us to do may vary according to the characteristics of those affected by what we do: concern for the well-being of children growing up in America would require that we teach them to read; concern for the well-being of pigs may require no more than that we leave them with other pigs in a place where there is adequate food and room to run freely. But the basic element-the taking into account of the interests of the being, whatever those interests may be-must, according to the principle of equality, be extended to all beings, black or white, masculine or feminine, human or nonhuman.</p>\n<p>Thomas Jefferson, who was responsible for writing the principle of the equality of men into the American Declaration of Independence, saw this point. It led him to oppose slavery even though he was unable to free himself fully from his slaveholding background. He wrote in a letter to the author of a book that emphasized the notable intellectual achievements of Negroes in order to refute the then common view that they had limited intellectual capacities:</p>\n<p>\u201cBe assured that no person living wishes more sincerely than I do, to see a complete refutation of the doubts I myself have entertained and expressed on the grade of understanding allotted to them by nature, and to find that they are on a par with ourselves... but whatever be their degree of talent it is no measure of their rights. Because Sir Isaac Newton was superior to others in understanding, he was not therefore lord of the property or persons of others.\u201d</p>\n<p>It is on this basis that the case against racism and the case against sexism must both ultimately rest; and it is in accordance with this principle that the attitude that we may call \"speciesism,\" by analogy with racism, must also be condemned. If possessing a higher degree of intelligence does not entitle one human to use another for his or her own ends, how can it entitle humans to exploit nonhumans for the same purpose? &nbsp;</p>\n<p>It may be objected that comparisons of the sufferings of different species are impossible to make and that for this reason when the interests of animals and humans clash the principle of equality gives no guidance. It is probably true that comparisons of suffering between members of different species cannot be made precisely, but precision is not essential. Even if we were to prevent the infliction of suffering on animals only when it is quite certain that the interests of humans will not be affected to anything like the extent that animals are affected, we would be forced to make radical changes in our treatment of animals that would involve our diet, the farming methods we use, experimental procedures in many fields of science, our approach to wildlife and to hunting, trapping and the wearing of furs, and areas of entertainment like circuses, rodeos, and zoos. As a result, a vast amount of suffering would be avoided.</p>\n\n", "user": {"username": "Introduction"}}, {"_id": "Tu4S9prsSi5teeWJe", "title": "The Haste Consideration", "postedAt": "2014-09-09T16:40:16.258Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><em>by Matt Wage, originally on the <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2012/04/the-haste-consideration/\">80,000 Hours Blog</a><a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2012/04/the-haste-consideration/\"></a></em></p>\n<p>The haste consideration: resources for improving the world are vastly more valuable if you have those resources sooner.</p>\n<p>I&#x2019;ll first explain one way to see that the haste consideration is true, and then I&#x2019;ll talk about one important implication of this consideration.</p>\n<p>People who dedicate a large part of their life to strategically doing as much good as possible - i.e. effective altruists - are able to accomplish vastly more good than most people will. Unfortunately, not many people are effective altruists.</p>\n<p>One way to try to improve the world would be to try to convince more people to be effective altruists. If you spent all of your efforts doing this, how long do you think it would take to convince one person who is at least as effective as you are at improving the world? For most people, if they&#x2019;re strategic about it, I think they could do it in less than&#xA0;two<span>&#xA0;</span>years.</p>\n<p>Now imagine two worlds:</p>\n<p>(1) You don&#x2019;t do anything altruistic for the next two<span>&#xA0;</span>years and then you spend the rest of your life after that improving the world as much as you can.</p>\n<p>(2) You spend the next 2 years influencing people to become effective altruists and convince one person who is at least as effective as you are at improving the world. (And assume that this person wouldn&apos;t have done anything altruistic otherwise.) You do nothing altruistic after the next 2 years, but the person you convinced does at least as much good as you did in (1).</p>\n<p>By stipulation, world (2) is improved at least as much as world (1) is because, in (2), the person you convinced does at least as much good as you did in (1).</p>\n<p>Many people object to this. They think, &#x201C;It&#x2019;s possible that world (1) could be improved more than world (2) is. For example, world (1) be better if, in that world, you convinced 10 people to be effective altruists who are at least as good as you.&#x201D; This is a natural thought, but remember that we are assuming that the person you convince in (2) is &#x201C;at least as good as you are at improving the world&#x201D;. This implies that if you convince 10 people in world (1), then the person you convinced in world (2) will do something at least as good as that. It&#x2019;s true by definition that world (2) is improved at least as much as world (1) is.</p>\n<p>There are two lessons we can take away from this. The first lesson is that influencing people to become effective altruists is a pretty high value strategy for improving the world. For any altruistic activity you&#x2019;re doing, it might be useful to ask yourself, &#x201C;Do I really think this will improve the world more than influencing would?&#x201D;</p>\n<p>The second lesson is that you can do more good with time in the present than you can with time in the future. If you spend the next&#xA0;two<span>&#xA0;</span>years doing something at least as good as influencing people to become effective altruists, then these&#xA0;two<span>&#xA0;</span>years will plausibly be more valuable than all of the rest of your life. In particular, these&#xA0;two<span>&#xA0;</span>years will be more valuable than any&#xA0;two-year period in the future. This is one way to see that the haste consideration is true.</p>\n<p>One implication of the haste consideration: It&#x2019;s plausible that how you spend the next few years of your life is more important than how you spend your life after that. For this reason, when choosing a career, you should pay special attention to how each career would require you to spend the next few years. For example, if a career would require you to spend the next few years studying in school and doing nothing altruistic, then this is a major cost of that career.</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Part of&#xA0;<a href=\"/ea/6x/introduction_to_effective_altruism/\">Introduction to Effective Altruism</a>&#xA0;</p>\n<p>Previous:&#xA0;<a href=\"/ea/76/your_dollar_goes_further_overseas/\">Your Dollar Goes Further Overseas</a>&#xA0;&#x2022; Next:&#xA0;<a href=\"/ea/50/preventing_human_extinction/\">Preventing Human Extinction</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/ea/50/preventing_human_extinction/\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/ea/50/preventing_human_extinction/\"></a></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Introduction"}}, {"_id": "dzz6qigHnHv6duN53", "title": "Your Dollar Goes Further Overseas", "postedAt": "2014-09-09T16:39:15.864Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><em>by GiveWell, from <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/giving101/Your-dollar-goes-further-overseas\">Giving 101</a></em></p>\n<p>We understand the sentiment that &quot;charity starts at home,&quot; and we used to agree with it, until we learned just how different U.S. charity is from charity aimed at the poorest people in the world.</p>\n<p>Helping people in the U.S. usually involves tackling extremely complex, poorly understood problems. Many popular approaches simply <a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/schools-are-not-the-key\">don&apos;t work</a>.&#xA0;Many more approaches have simply never been investigated, beyond the stories and anecdotes.</p>\n<p>In the poorest parts of the world, people suffer from very different problems.

Some activities are highly proven and cost-effective; others have very poor track records.

Or what this even means.</p>\n<p>Indeed, many people don&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;s even possible to work this out!&#xA0;We don&#x2019;t agree. However, we think that if you don&#x2019;t try to weigh up your options, you&#x2019;ll end up doing far less for the world than you could otherwise be doing.</p>\n<p>How, then, do we go about helping you decide in which career can you make the most difference? It&#x2019;s not an easy question, but it is a fascinating one that has a great deal of importance to the world.</p>\n<h1>What factors are the most important?</h1>\n<p>After talking one-on-one with around 100 people about their careers, asking people who have made a big impact, and thinking through what matters, we&#x2019;ve developed a simple framework for assessing the value of different careers.</p>\n<p>We expect this framework will develop significantly and become more precise over time as we come to gain a better grasp over which factors matter. It just represents our best guess at which key factors are most important, organised in a way that we&#x2019;ve found relatively easy to understand and evaluate separately.</p>\n<p>In summary, we find it useful to judge careers on two key factors:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Immediate Impact</li>\n<li>Building career capital</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We break immediate impact down further into: the size of your contribution multiplied by the effectiveness of the cause you work on.</p>\n<p>We break career capital down into: skills, network and CV points.</p>\n<p>In the rest of this post, I&#x2019;ll go over these factors in more detail.</p>\n<h2>1) Immediate Impact</h2>\n<p>This is the immediate scope you have to make the world a better place through this career over the next couple of years.</p>\n<p>We break this down into the multiple of two further factors: Impact = Contribution x Cause Effectiveness</p>\n<h3><span>a) Contribution</span></h3>\n<p>In some careers, you have more ability to contribute to important problems than others. Simply put, Presidents are more influential than sandwich makers. There are many ways to contribute to a cause, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gaining a public platform and using it to spread an important idea </li>\n<li>Gaining a network and using it to spread an idea or carry out a project </li>\n<li>Donating money </li>\n<li>Influencing budgets in existing organizations or by building a new organization </li>\n<li>In addition, there&#x2019;s the direct contribution you make through your work</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&#x2019;s often useful to assess careers on how much contribution you&#x2019;ll be able to make along each of these dimensions.</p>\n<h3>b) Cause effectiveness</h3>\n<p>To make a big difference, you&#x2019;ll want to work on the problems where your contribution will go as far as possible. These are problems which are both important - worth doing something about - and tractable - it&#x2019;s possible to do something about them. We call these effective causes.</p>\n<p>The relation seems to be multiplicative. If your contribution increases by 10x, then so does your impact. Likewise with the effectiveness of your cause.</p>\n<h2>2) Building Career Capital</h2>\n<p>This is the extent to which the career path builds your general ability to take high impact opportunities in the future.</p>\n<p>For most people, it is very hard to figure out what projects they will be working on beyond 3 &#x2013; 5 years, and so we don&#x2019;t find it very useful to try to evaluate the impact of these projects. Rather, we prefer to evaluate individuals&#x2019; general potential to have an impact. We call this career capital.</p>\n<p>Your long-term general potential is often more important than your immediate impact. Most careers only peak after around 20 years<a href=\"#_ftn2\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup>[2]</sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a> - you&#x2019;ll be having more impact when you manage the charity rather than intern for it. Developing your career capital may be preferable to acting directly because your knowledge of which cause is most important are very likely to change.</p>\n<p>We break down career capital into the quality of your network, skills and CV.</p>\n<h3><span>a) Network</span></h3>\n<p>Getting a job often depends on who you know. So if you know more influential people, you may have more valuable employment options. Your network can also help you to have a direct impact: it&#x2019;s easier to lobby the government if you know a senator.</p>\n<h3>b) Skills</h3>\n<p>Your skills will also determine who is willing to hire you. Moreover, your skills are what you&#x2019;ll use, in addition to your network, to make a difference. Because of literature on expert performance<a href=\"#_ftn3\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup>[3]</sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a>, we believe it is possible to develop competency in many areas with training.With training, we think it&#x2019;s possible to increase your ability to get stuff done a great deal So &#xA0;skill development appears very important.</p>\n<h3>c) CV Points</h3>\n<p>People will assess your job application based on your work experience and qualifications. Some jobs are prerequisites for further jobs. For instance, you won&#x2019;t be considered for a career as a lawyer unless you have the right qualifications, even if you know all you need to know. Some careers or qualifications are useful as a means of signaling your ability to others. For instance, it is harder to get into finance if you have not graduated from an elite school, regardless of your true skill. These are important factors.</p>\n<h1>So in which careers can you make the most difference?</h1>\n<p>We&#x2019;ve argued that keeping your options open is very important for effective altruists - probably at least comparable to your immediate impact. This suggests that building career capital, which seems to be the main way to improve your options, is at least as important as your immediate impact.</p>\n<p>or many effective altruists, especially those at the start of their career, Sowe favor first focusing on the careers that are best for building your career, and then factoring in immediate impact.</p>\n<p>By applying this framework in light of detailed information about various careers we have formulated the following provisional thoughts about career impact:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>If you&#x2019;re looking to build career capital, consider entrepreneurship, consulting or an economics PhD.</li>\n<li>If you&#x2019;re looking to pursue earning to give, consider high-end finance, tech entrepreneurship, law, consulting and medicine. These careers are all high-earning in part due to being highly demanding. Our impression is that software engineering, being an actuary and dentistry are somewhat less demanding but also highly paid.</li>\n<li>If you&#x2019;d like to make an impact more directly, consider party politics, founding effective non-profits, working inside international organizations, government or foundations to improve them, and doing valuable academic research.</li>\n<li>If you&#x2019;d like to advocate for effective causes, consider party politics, journalism, and working in international organizations, policy-oriented civil service or foundations.</li>\n<li>Some career paths that look promising overall are: tech entrepreneurship, consulting, party politics, founding effective non-profits and working in international organizations.</li>\n<li>Some paths we think are promising but are largely neglected by 80,000 Hours members and would like to learn more about are: party politics, working in international organizations, being a program manager at a foundation, journalism, policy-oriented civil service and marketing.<a href=\"#_ftn4\"><sup><!--[if !supportFootnotes]--><sup>[4]</sup><!--[endif]--></sup></a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Although the background information on these careers cannot be presented in this short essay, it is largely available on our website, 80000hours.org.</p>\n<h1>Footnotes</h1>\n<div><!--[endif]-->\n<div>\n<p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\"><!--[if !supportFootnotes]-->[1]<!--[endif]--></a> This article was initially posted in July 2013 on the 80,000 Hours blog (<ins><a href=\"http://80000hours.org/blog/238-how-to-assess-the-impact-of-a-career\">www.80000hours.org/blog/238-how-to-assess-the-impact-of-a-career</a></ins>).

In the 1970s hundreds of millions of people will starve to death in spite of any crash programs embarked upon now. At this late date nothing can prevent a substantial increase in the world death rate.</p>\n<p>Ehrlich predicted the deaths as a consequence of the challenge of feeding a rapidly growing world population, pointing to recent devastating famines in South Asia. But even as those words were written, the fields were being planted with new, higher-yielding semi-dwarf strains of wheat and rice. Combined with modern fertilizers and other methods, these strains ushered in the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_revolution\">&#x201C;Green Revolution&#x201D;</a>: wheat production in India and Pakistan almost doubled between 1965 and 1970, and formerly famine-wracked countries became self-sufficient in food and have not seen such hunger since. The agronomist Norman Borlaug, who developed new and more effective methods of plant breeding, used them to develop the key strain of wheat, and brought about expansion of his methods to other crops and deployment in South Asia, played a pivotal role.</p>\n<p>Some <a href=\"http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1997/01/forgotten-benefactor-of-humanity/6101/\">credit him</a> with saving a billion lives,&#xA0;referring to the number of people fed by the increase agricultural production of the Green Revolution. Indisputably, scientific and technological advances and technological innovation have brought about almost incredible amounts of good.</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/8xmMDCF.jpg?1\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<h1>Not whether, but when?</h1>\n<p>However, when we ask how we can effectively do good in our careers, the key question is not how much scientific research on the whole has made the world better: it is &#x201C;how do I expect the world to be different if I take up this career, rather than another one?&#x201D; If Norman Borlaug had never lived his discoveries would eventually have been made by others. Continued food scarcity would have evoked both market and government responses in increased research. Fertilizers and other agricultural technologies would have been applied without enhanced crop varieties, capturing some of the Green Revolution&#x2019;s benefits. We should think of achievements like Borlaug&#x2019;s as bringing about technologies faster, rather than making them possible at all.</p>\n<p>However, tremendous impacts are possible through speeding the pace of progress, even slightly. According to the <a href=\"http://www.who.int/malaria/world_malaria_report_2010/malaria2010_summary_keypoints_en.pdf\">WHO</a>, malaria killed over 781,000 people in 2009. If current trends continue, advances in vaccines, bednets, mosquito control, and increased deployment efforts will likely eventually drive down fatalities to zero. But leaping ahead in this process by a single year could save 781,000 lives. A single day&#x2019;s speedup would save 2,139 lives. Advancing the process by even 40 seconds would save a life. Then the question becomes: how many seconds can you expect to advance your field over your career?</p>\n<p>Norman Borlaug advanced progress on a massive issue by years, a truly exceptional achievement that very likely saved millions of lives or more over time. But far more scientists, working on important but neglected problems, could each hope to do good comparable to moving malaria eradication forward several days. Such an achievement could do as much good as donating millions of pounds to apply existing vaccines or drugs.</p>\n<h1>How much can I advance my field?</h1>\n<p>When we consider donating to administer treatments for tuberculosis or malaria, we can measure lives saved through randomized experiment: administer the treatment to half of a study population at random, and see how many more members of the vaccinated group remain healthy. Estimating the impact of individual research contributions is harder.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s easy to measure inputs such as R&amp;D funding and scientific workforce. For instance, <a href=\"http://www.malariavaccine.org/files/RD-report-June2011.pdf\">spending on malaria</a> R&amp;D was $612 million in 2009, after doubling from 2004 levels thanks to increased spending by the Gates Foundation and United States NIAID. So one can fairly easily find out whether adding one&#x2019;s brain or donations to the field will boost the relevant inputs by 10% or by 0.01%, and rephrase questions about impact of additional researchers in terms of the speed increase from a percentage resource increase. Will doubling R&amp;D budgets cut development time by at least 10%? 2%? 0.2%?

The cost of vaccine development was estimated based on the costs and frequency of past partially successful vaccine candidates. They then found very large benefits relative to costs from increasing annual R&amp;D spending from $900 million to $1 billion, provided that this increase would accelerate vaccine development by ~5 months (vs a baseline 20-30 year timeframe), so that vaccine research would outrank deployment of existing treatments in cost-effectiveness.</p>\n<p>Reasoning like this, taking into account the magnitude of potential gains in a field, the scale of inputs so far, track records in similar fields, expert judgment (with <a href=\"http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7959.html\">caveats</a>) and interim successes, can make a good start at deciding what research areas to bet on when trying to steer towards high impact.</p>\n<p>Opportunities for&#xA0;high-impact science are present within a wide variety of fields, including not&#xA0;only public health but also physics, mathematics, computer science, economics,&#xA0;and many more.&#xA0;</p>\n<p>&#xA0;</p>\n<div>\n<div>\n<p>Part of&#xA0;<a href=\"/ea/6x/introduction_to_effective_altruism/\">Introduction to Effective Altruism</a><span>&#xA0;</span></p>\n<p>Previous:&#xA0;<a href=\"/ea/4a/to_save_the_world_dont_get_a_job_at_a_charity_go/\">To Save the World, Don&apos;t Get a Job at a Charity, Go Work on Wall Street</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"/ea/4a/to_save_the_world_dont_get_a_job_at_a_charity_go/\"></a>Next:&#xA0;<a href=\"/ea/75/how_to_assess_the_impact_of_a_career/\">How to Assess the Impact of a Career</a></p>\n</div>\n</div></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Introduction"}}, {"_id": "D32Edox9vgvmnfEQi", "title": "GiveWell's Top Charities for Giving Season 2013", "postedAt": "2014-09-09T16:19:18.615Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><p><em>by <a href=\"http://givewell.org\">Givewell</a>,&#xA0;originally from the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/01/givewells-top-charities-for-giving-season-2013/\">GiveWell Blog</a></em></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/D9eM2OZ.gif\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>Our top charities for this giving season are&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/give-directly\">GiveDirectly</a>,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative\">Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI)</a>, and the&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/deworm-world-initiative\">Deworm the World Initiative (DtWI)</a>&#xA0;(led by Evidence Action). The first two have been recommended&#xA0;<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2012/11/26/our-top-charities-for-the-2012-giving-season/\">previously</a>.</p>\n<p>The third is a new addition, and we encourage readers to see our&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/deworm-world-initiative\">full review</a>.&#xA0;We&#x2019;ve had extensive internal discussions about how to rank these three giving opportunities against each other. These discussions have been particularly challenging this year because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The three have extremely different strengths and weaknesses, in our view. Much of the decision between them comes down to judgment calls about how to weigh factors such as (a) estimated cost-effectiveness of a charity&#x2019;s activities (SCI appears strongest here, in isolation, though some staff discount this observation because of the low robustness of our estimates); (b) potential&#xA0;<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/16/leverage-in-charity/\">leverage</a>&#xA0;(DtWI has a potential advantage here, as it focuses on influencing government spending rather than covering all costs with its own funds); (c) a direct and robust case for impact (we believe GiveDirectly is strongest on this front); (d) &#x201C;upside,&#x201D; in terms of potential for the charity&#x2019;s growth to have far-reaching effects beyond the direct impact of its services. (We think all three have some &#x201C;upside&#x201D; but see GiveDirectly as particularly promising in terms of its potential to improve the aid community&#x2019;s understanding of, and interest in, cash transfer programs.)</li>\n<li>The amounts of money given on the strength of our recommendations could be substantial, and so the question of &#x201C;what do further donations accomplish?&#x201D; can have complex answers: for example, the first million dollars to a charity can be quite different in their expected impact from the second million. We lay out what we know about each charity&#x2019;s funding gap below.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For each charity, we have set out a &#x201C;minimum target&#x201D; that we very much hope to see it raise. The targets have no precision to them, but roughly speaking, we see more value in donations up to the minimum target for&#xA0;each&#xA0;charity than in donations beyond the minimum target for&#xA0;any&#xA0;of them. (In other words, if two of the charities had hit their minimum target and the third had not, we would prefer additional donations to go to the third charity until it hit its minimum target.) We believe that each charity will hit its minimum target. We would also be happy to see each charity raise funds beyond its minimum target, and expect that this will happen to some degree.</p>\n<p>The minimum targets consider both the nature of the funding gap and the goal of providing positive incentives via rewarding charities that exemplify the values GiveWell is seeking to promote, such as transparency, strong monitoring and evaluation, and full participation in GiveWell&#x2019;s evaluation process. We believe that all three top charities are outstanding in these&#xA0;respects and thus hope to move substantial funds to each, though we also feel there are some differences on this front that contribute to our differing minimum targets.</p>\n<p>When it comes to donations beyond the minimum target, we haven&#x2019;t reached a clear conclusion on which charities should be prioritized, and feel that donors will decide &#x2013; reasonably accurately &#x2013; which charities are the best fit for their own worldview and values with the guidance we provide. Accordingly, we have decided <strong>not to provide numerical rankings this year</strong>.</p>\n<p>Please note that there will be some additional content coming out within the next 1-2 weeks:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.goodventures.org/\">Good Ventures</a>&#xA0;is planning to announce its own plans re: grants to top charities.&#xA0;<strong>We expect this announcement to come this week&#xA0;and expect that it may influence donors&#x2019; choices</strong>. [Ed: this was the <a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/03/good-ventures-matching-gift-to-givedirectly-and-grants-to-top-charities/\">announcement</a> that they would match donations to GiveDirectly]</li>\n<li>We are planning to write about the evolution of our&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/criteria\">criteria for recommending charities</a>, which are being modified from what they were in previous years. This content will not be directly relevant to the choice&#xA0;between&#xA0;charities (this post attempts to summarize all relevant considerations).</li>\n<li>We are also planning to have individual staff members (who feel comfortable doing so) announce their plans and their reasoning for their own personal giving. In general, the most popular choice internally is GiveDirectly.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The rest of this post lays out what we see as the key considerations regarding the funding gap, strengths and weaknesses of each recommended charity.</p>\n<div>\n<h1>Give Directly</h1>\n</div>\n<div>\n<h2>Funding gap</h2>\n</div>\n<p>GiveDirectly We provide the details of GiveDirectly&#x2019;s funding gap in our&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/give-directly#Roomformorefunding\">review</a>. In brief, GiveDirectly has told us that, to facilitate its planning, it aims to raise $40 million, the amount it budgets for 2014 and 2015. It hopes to spend $14 million in 2014 and $26 million in 2015.</p>\n<p>As of the writing of this blog post, GiveDirectly has allocated or committed over $5 million to cash transfer campaigns (the vast majority of these funds in the past year), utilizing most of the funds it has received to date from donors.</p>\n<p>Our understanding is that the majority of additional donations will go directly to cash transfers, which themselves are part of GiveDirectly&#x2019;s (a) experimentation with its operational model as it expands and (b) experiments into the impacts of different models of cash transfer programs.</p>\n<p>We hope that GiveDirectly is able to close a sizable portion of its funding gap, and have set a &#x201C;minimum target&#x201D; of $2.5 million, about half of what it has spent in the last year. We would be relatively comfortable with its receiving up to $20 million, though as it received more funds we would begin to prefer that those funds be allocated elsewhere.</p>\n<p>Details on GiveDirectly&#x2019;s room for more funding</p>\n<h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Program impact and cost-effectiveness.</strong>&#xA0;Cash transfers are relatively strongly evidence-backed, and are in the range of our other priority programs&#x2019; cost-effectiveness, but our best guess is that cash transfers are 2-3x less cost-effective than the deworming programs carried out by SCI. Details at&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/2013%20GiveWell%20Cost%20effectiveness%20analysis%20final.xlsx\">our updated cost-effectiveness spreadsheet</a>. Our estimates are subject to substantial uncertainty.</li>\n<li><strong>Monitoring and evaluation.</strong>&#xA0;All the programs implemented by our&#xA0;<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/12/01/givewells-top-charities-for-giving-season-2013/charities/top-charities\">top charities</a>&#xA0;are evidence-backed, but GiveDirectly is the only one that has a randomized controlled trial (finding strong results) of its own implementation of its program. Thus, GiveDirectly has been evaluated in a more rigorous way than our other top charities. We also feel that we have seen stronger evidence of successful execution of its program than for our other top charities.</li>\n<li><strong>Directness and robustness of the case for impact.</strong>&#xA0;We believe there is a highly direct and robust connection between GiveDirectly&#x2019;s receiving funds and those funds reaching very poor individuals. We believe GiveDirectly to be the strongest of the recommended charities on this front.</li>\n<li><strong>Transparency and participation in our process.&#xA0;</strong>GiveDirectly has been exceptionally open with us, enabling us to understand the full details of its work.</li>\n<li><strong>Scale.&#xA0;</strong>Were GiveDirectly to receive the full level of support it is seeking, this would result in a significant increase in scale. We view this both as a risk and an opportunity. As of the end of 2013, GiveDirectly was distributing cash at a rate of approximately $3.6 million per year; it hopes to reach close to $15 million by the end of 2014. GiveDirectly has scaled up successfully in the past; it had been distributing cash at a rate of $360,000 per year at the end of 2012. For donors who believe GiveDirectly can effectively scale up, this represents an opportunity to provide early-stage funding to an organization that may eventually grow to be much larger. For donors who are skeptical of GiveDirectly&#x2019;s ability to scale, providing such funds may appear unreasonably risky (though only after the first $5-10 million in support; the first $5-10 million would be consistent with the size GiveDirectly has been to date).&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/give-directly\">Full GiveDirectly review</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h1>Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI)</h1>\n<h2>Funding gap</h2>\n<p>SCI has told us that it hopes to raise at least $4 million for work it plans to undertake in 2014 and believes it could effectively absorb up to $10 million (though some of this spending would spread into 2015). This work would mostly consist of direct implementation of deworming.</p>\n<p>Since November 2011, when we first recommended SCI, SCI has received approximately $4.6 million in unrestricted funds. It has spent $2.9 million, committed an additional $1.2 million and approximately $1 million remains unallocated, including approximately $500,000 it had in reserve prior to our recommendation (<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative/updates/October-2013#Activitiesfundedwithunrestrictedfunds\">more</a>).</p>\n<p>We have set a &#x201C;minimum target&#x201D; of $1 million for SCI, which is consistent with the levels of GiveWell-attributable funding it has received in the past. We would be relatively comfortable with its receiving up to $10 million, though as it received more funds we would begin to prefer that those funds be allocated elsewhere.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative#Roomformorefunds\">Details of SCI&#x2019;s room for more funding</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative#Roomformorefunds\"></a></p>\n<h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Program impact and cost-effectiveness.</strong>&#xA0;Our best guess is that SCI&#x2019;s deworming program is more cost-effective than cash transfers by a factor of 2-3x and 1-2x as cost-effective as DtWI&#x2019;s deworming program. Details at&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/2013%20GiveWell%20Cost%20effectiveness%20analysis%20final.xlsx\">our updated cost-effectiveness spreadsheet</a>. Our estimates are subject to substantial uncertainty.</li>\n<li><strong>Monitoring and evaluation.&#xA0;</strong>We recently&#xA0;<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/11/29/rethinking-scis-evidence-of-impact-2/\">became aware of major limitations</a>&#xA0;to the studies we had previously been relying on as evidence of SCI&#x2019;s impact. We will be reviewing further evidence that SCI sent us in response; we had not previously focused on collecting such evidence because of our impression that the studies we were using were sufficient. The program SCI works on (<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/deworming\">deworming</a>) is relatively strongly evidence-backed.</li>\n<li><strong>Directness and robustness of the case for impact.&#xA0;</strong>We believe that the connection between SCI&#x2019;s receiving funds and those funds&#x2019; reaching very poor individuals is more direct than DtWI&#x2019;s but less direct than GiveDirectly&#x2019;s. SCI has spent (and plans to spend) a sizable amount of its budget directly carrying out deworming programs, but it also spends funds on a variety of activities related to deworming (e.g., advocacy, operational research).</li>\n<li><strong>Transparency and participation in our process.&#xA0;</strong>From 2009 (when we first made contact with SCI) through mid-2013, we struggled to communicate well with SCI. Since August 2013, our communication with has SCI has improved substantially. We still do not feel that we have the same level of visibility into SCI&#x2019;s operations as we do into those of our other top charities, and this is a major factor in the relatively lower &#x201C;minimum target&#x201D; we have set for SCI as opposed to other top charities, though we are optimistic that this will change in the next year.</li>\n<li><strong>Scale.&#xA0;</strong>Were SCI to receive $5 million, it would represent an increase in the amount of funding it processes. SCI has spent (or committed) approximately $2 million in unrestricted funds in each of the past two years and is currently primarily funded by a 5-year, ~$15 million grant from DFID. It is currently under consideration for a 4-year, $15-18 million grant from DFID. In sum, SCI has been operating at a level of approximately $6 million/year and may soon be operating at a level of approximately $10 million/year (due to the DFID grant). An additional $5-10 million would increase its scale further.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/schistosomiasis-control-initiative\">Full SCI review</a></p>\n<h1>Deworm the World Initiative, led by Evidence Action (DtWI)</h1>\n<h2>Funding gap</h2>\n<p>DtWI has told us that it would like to receive $2-3 million to give it the flexibility to pursue opportunities that are not directly funded by other donors. It has also told us that Evidence Action, its parent organization, has a funding gap over the next 2 years of $5-7 million.</p>\n<p>Because our analysis has focused on DtWI, we have focused on its funding gap.</p>\n<p>We would like&#xA0;to see DtWI close much or all of its gap so that it can have an adequate supply of unrestricted funding, and we have set a minimum target of $2 million. We see significantly less value in funds beyond that point, and particularly past the $3 million mark.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/deworm-world-initiative#Roomformorefunds\">Details of DtWI&#x2019;s room for more funding</a></p>\n<h2>Strengths and Weaknesses</h2>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Program impact and cost-effectiveness.</strong>&#xA0;In isolation, our best guess is that DtWI&#x2019;s deworming program is likely less cost effective than SCI&#x2019;s (about 50-100% as cost effective) and GiveWell staff differ about its cost-effectiveness relative to cash transfers (1.5-3x as cost effective). This is because worm infections appear less prevalent and (particularly) less intense where DtWI works than where SCI works. However, DtWI focuses on influencing government spending rather than covering all costs with its own funds, and we think it is therefore appropriate to give it some degree of credit for &#x201C;leverage&#x201D; &#x2013; making your dollars go further than they otherwise would. Estimating the degree of &#x201C;leverage&#x201D; is highly subjective; our best guess is that it should add a multiplier of about 3 to the cost-effectiveness, making DtWI more than competitive with other top charities on this front. Details at&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/files/DWDA%202009/2013%20GiveWell%20Cost%20effectiveness%20analysis%20final.xlsx\">our updated cost-effectiveness spreadsheet</a>.</li>\n<li><strong>Monitoring and evaluation.</strong>&#xA0;We believe DtWI&#x2019;s self-evaluation to have been less rigorous than that of GiveDirectly, though we are hopeful that it will improve going forward. (As noted above, we are currently revisiting the quality of SCI&#x2019;s self-evaluation.)</li>\n<li><strong>Directness and robustness of the case for impact.&#xA0;</strong>DtWI is a technical assistance/advocacy organization, and therefore the chain from donation to person helped is the least direct of any of our top charities. This is the flip side of DtWI&#x2019;s potential &#x201C;leverage&#x201D; &#x2013; because it focuses on influencing and assisting other players rather than on direct implementation, its value-added per dollar spent is quite plausibly higher but also harder to pin down.</li>\n<li><strong>Quality of communication.&#xA0;</strong>From 2009 (when we first made contact) through early 2013, we struggled to communicate well with DtWI. Since early 2013 (which coincided with DtWI changing its leadership), our ability to communicate with DtWI improved substantially. We now feel that we have as much visibility into DtWI&#x2019;s operations as we do any of our other top charities.</li>\n<li><strong>Scale.</strong>&#xA0;Our understanding is that $2-3 million in unrestricted funds will provide DtWI with flexibility that will be helpful as it grows. Because DtWI requests $2-3 million, we would expect that any funds it receives above $2-3 million would likely effectively support Evidence Action more broadly (e.g., its Dispensers for Safe Water program, which we have not examined although we have published a&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/water-quality\">report on water quality interventions</a>, and potentially other initiatives that it might launch).</li>\n<li><strong>Fungibility.&#xA0;</strong>DtWI is an initiative led by its parent organization, Evidence Action. There is some possibility that funds given due to this recommendation effectively support Evidence Action and its Dispensers for Safe Water program (or future initiatives) rather than DtWI. If donors are particularly concerned about this, they should carefully consider their support of DtWI.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/deworm-world-initiative\">Full DtWI review</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/deworm-world-initiative\"></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/deworm-world-initiative\"></a></p>\n<h1>A note on Against Malaria Foundation (AMF)</h1>\n<p>As discussed&#xA0;<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2013/11/26/change-in-against-malaria-foundation-recommendation-status-room-for-more-funding-related/\">in this blog post</a>, we are not recommending AMF to donors this year due to lack of short-term room for more funding.

Therefore we shouldn&#x2019;t do P&#x2019;.</p>\n<p>This could make sense if X wasn&#x2019;t especially integral to the goal. For instance if the proposal were to measure short distances by triangulation with nearby objects, a reasonable criticism would be that the angles are hard to measure, relative to measuring the distance directly. But this argument is commonly used in situations where optimizing X is the whole point of the activity, or a large part of it.</p>\n<p>Criticism of utilitarianism provides a good example. A common argument is that it&#x2019;s just not possible to tell if you are increasing net utility, or by how much. The critic concludes then that a different moral strategy is better, for instance some sort of intuitive deontology. But if the utilitarian is correct that value is about providing creatures with utility, then the extreme difficulty of doing the associated mathematics perfectly should not warrant abandoning the goal. One should always be better off putting the reduced effort one is willing to contribute into what utilitarian accuracy it buys, rather than throwing it away on a strategy that is more random with regard to the goal.</p>\n<p>A CEO would sound ridiculous making this argument to his shareholders. &#x2018;You guys are being ridiculous. It&#x2019;s just not possible to know which actions will increase the value of the company exactly how much. Why don&#x2019;t we try to make sure that all of our meetings end on time instead?&#x2019;</p>\n<p>In general, when optimizing X somehow is integral to the goal, the argument must fail. If the point is to make X as close to three as possible for instance, no matter how bad your best estimate is of what X will be under different conditions, you can&#x2019;t do better by ignoring X all together. If you had a non-estimating-X strategy which you anticipated would do better than your best estimate in getting a good value of X, then you in fact believe yourself to have a better estimating-X strategy.</p>\n<p>I have criticized this kind of argument before in the specific realm of valuing of human life, but it seems to apply more widely.&#xA0; Another recent example: people&#x2019;s attention spans vary between different activities, therefore there is no such thing as an attention span and we shouldn&#x2019;t try to make it longer. Arguably similar to some lines of &#x2018;people are good at different things, therefore there is no such thing as intelligence and we shouldn&#x2019;t try to measure it or thereby improve it&#x2019;.</p>\n<p>Probabilistic risk assessment is claimed by some to be impossibly difficult. People are often wrong, and may fail to think of certain contingencies in advance. So if we want to know how prepared to be for a nuclear war for instance, we should do something qualitative with scenarios and the like. This could be a defensible position. Perhaps intuitions can better implicitly assess probabilities via some other activity than explicitly thinking about them. However I have not heard this claim accompanied by any such motivating evidence. Also if this were true, it would likely make sense to convert the qualitative assessments into quantitative ones and aggregate them with information from other sources rather than disregarding quantitative assessments all together.</p>\n<p>Part of&#xA0;<a href=\"/ea/6x/introduction_to_effective_altruism/\">Introduction to Effective Altruism</a></p>\n<p>Previous:&#xA0;<a href=\"/ea/5e/efficient_charity_do_unto_others/\">Efficient Charity, Do Unto Others</a>&#xA0;&#x2022; Next: <a href=\"/ea/73/givewells_top_charities_for_giving_season_2013/\">GiveWell&apos;s Top Charities for Giving Season 2013</a></p></body></html>", "user": {"username": "Introduction"}}, {"_id": "2X9rBEBwxBwxAo9Sd", "title": "The Moral Imperative Towards Cost-effectiveness", "postedAt": "2014-09-09T16:14:02.658Z", "htmlBody": "<p><em>by Toby Ord, originally on the <a href=\"http://www.givingwhatwecan.org/sites/givingwhatwecan.org/files/attachments/moral_imperative.pdf\">Giving What We Can</a> website</em></p>\n<p>Cost-effectiveness is one of the most morally important issues in global health. This claim will be surprising to many, since conversations about the ethics of global health usually focus on more traditional moral issues such as justice, equality, and freedom. While these issues are also important, they are often overshadowed by cost-effectiveness. In this note, I shall explain how this happens and what it means for global health.</p>\n<h1>The cost-effectiveness landscape in global health</h1>\n<p>The importance of cost-effectiveness is due to the fact that it varies so much between different interventions. Let us start with a simplified example to show how this becomes a moral consideration. Suppose we have a $40,000 budget which we can spend as we wish to fight blindness. One thing we could do is to provide guide dogs to blind people in the United States to help them overcome their disability. This costs about $40,000 due to the training required for the dog and its recipient. <fn><sup id=\"fnref1\"><a href=\"#fn1\" rel=\"footnote\">[1]</a></sup></fn> Another option is to pay for surgeries to reverse the effects of trachoma in Africa. This costs less than $20 per patient cured. <fn><sup id=\"fnref1\"><a href=\"#fn2\" rel=\"footnote\">[2]</a></sup></fn> There are many other options, but for simplicity, let us just consider these two.</p>\n<p>We could thus use our entire budget to provide a single guide dog, helping one person overcome the challenges of blindness, or we could use it to cure more than 2,000 people of blindness. If we think that people have equal moral value, then the second option is more than 2,000 times better than the first. Put another way, the first option squanders about 99.95% of the value that we could have produced.</p>\n<p>This example illustrates the basic point, but it is also unrealistic in a couple of ways. Firstly, it is rare for treatments in the United States to be traded off against treatments elsewhere. A health budget is normally more restricted than this, with a constraint that it is only spent on people in a particular rich country, or only spent on people in a designated category of poor countries. Secondly, we often have a spectrum of options. Thirdly, and most importantly, the class of interventions under consideration is often broad enough that it is difficult to make direct \u2018apples to apples\u2019 comparisons between the effects of two interventions.</p>\n<p>Health economists and moral philosophers have an answer to the third of these issues. They use measures of health benefits that are powerful enough to be able to compare the values of any two health benefits. The standard measure in global health is the Disability Adjusted Life Year (DALY). This measures the disvalue of health conditions in terms of the number of years of life lost due to the condition plus the number of years lived with disability multiplied by a number representing the severity of the disability. For example, a condition that caused one to die 5 years prematurely and to live the last 10 years with deafness would be valued as 5 + (10 x 33.3%) = 8.33 DALYs.</p>\n<p>There are a number of complications and choices regarding the calculation of DALYs, which give rise to a number of subtly different versions of DALYs and the closely related units called QALYs. Chief among these is the question of the size of the weightings representing how bad it is on average to suffer from a particular disability. There are also considerations about discount rates and age weightings.</p>\n<p>Different reasonable choices on these parameters could change the number of DALYs due to a condition by a few percent or by as much as a factor of two. DALYs should thus be considered only as a rough measure of the disvalue of different conditions. It might seem that there would be little use for so rough a measure. This would be true if the difference in cost-effectiveness between interventions were also about a factor of two, but since it is often a factor of a hundred or more, a rough measure is perfectly adequate for making the key comparisons.</p>\n<p>Let us now address all of the three concerns, by looking at a real world example of funding the prevention or treatment of HIV and AIDS. Let us consider four intervention types: surgical treatment for Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma (an AIDS defining illness), antiretroviral therapy to fight the virus in infected people, prevention of transmission of HIV from mother to child during pregnancy, condom distribution to prevent transmission more generally, and education for high risk groups such as sex workers. It is initially very unclear which of these interventions would be best to fund, and one might assume that they are roughly equal in importance. However, the most comprehensive compendium on cost-effectiveness in global health, Disease Control Priorities in Developing Countries 2nd edition (hereafter DCP2), lists their estimated cost-effectiveness as follows:<fn><sup id=\"fnref1\"><a href=\"#fn3\" rel=\"footnote\">[3]</a></sup></fn></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1674616355/mirroredImages/2X9rBEBwxBwxAo9Sd/c9jqiexjaenofhem4ml2.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Note the wide discrepancies between the effectiveness of each intervention type. Treatment for Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma cannot be seen on the chart at this scale, but that says more about the other interventions being good than about this treatment being bad: treating Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma is considered cost-effective in a rich country setting. Antiretroviral therapy is estimated to be 50 times as effective as treatment of Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma; prevention of transmission during pregnancy is 5 times as effective as this; condom distribution is about twice as effective as that; and education for high risk groups is about twice as effective again. In total, the best of these interventions is estimated to be 1,400 times as cost-effective as the least good, or more than 1,400 times better than it would need to be in order to be funded in rich countries.</p>\n<p>This discrepancy becomes even larger if we make comparisons between interventions targeted at different types of illness. DCP2 includes cost-effectiveness estimates for 108 health interventions, which are presented in the chart below, arranged from least effective to most effective.<fn><sup id=\"fnref4\"><a href=\"#fn4\" rel=\"footnote\">[4]</a></sup></fn></p>\n<p>&nbsp;<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1674616355/mirroredImages/2X9rBEBwxBwxAo9Sd/el0b3ywtfnpmsskryz2z.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>This larger sample of interventions is even more disparate in terms of cost-effectiveness. The least effective intervention analysed is still the treatment for Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, but there are also interventions up to ten times more cost-effective than education for high risk groups. In total, the interventions are spread over more than four orders of magnitude, ranging from 0.02 to 300 DALYs per $1,000, with a median of 5. Thus, moving money from the least effective intervention to the most effective would produce about 15,000 times the benefit, and even moving it from the median intervention to the most effective would produce about 60 times the benefit.</p>\n<p>It can also be seen that due to the skewed distribution, the most effective interventions produce a disproportionate amount of the benefits. According to the DCP2 data, if we funded all of these interventions equally, 80% of the benefits would be produced by the top 20% of the interventions.</p>\n<p>It must be noted that these are merely estimates of cost-effectiveness and there may be less variance between the real, underlying cost-effectiveness values. However, even if the most effective interventions are a tenth as effective as these figures suggest and the least effective are ten times better than they appear, there would still be a factor of 150 between them.</p>\n<p>Moreover, there have been health interventions that are even more effective than any of those studied in the DCP2. For example, consider the progress that has been made on saving lives lost to immunization preventable illness, diarrhea, malaria, and smallpox, summarized in the following chart:<fn><sup id=\"fnref5\"><a href=\"#fn5\" rel=\"footnote\">[5]</a></sup></fn></p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1674616355/mirroredImages/2X9rBEBwxBwxAo9Sd/oofddge4lytg96mzuo69.png\" alt=\"\"></p>\n<p>In all cases, our interventions have led to at least 2.5 million fewer deaths per year. To aid the reader in comprehending the scale of these achievements, I have added a final bar showing the average number of deaths per year due to war and genocide together over the 20th Century (2.3 million). Thus, in each of the four of these disease areas, our health interventions save more lives than would be saved by a lasting world peace.</p>\n<p>Moreover, these gains have been achieved very cheaply. For instance in the case of smallpox, the total cost of eradication was about $400 million.<fn><sup id=\"fnref6\"><a href=\"#fn6\" rel=\"footnote\">[6]</a></sup></fn> Since more than 100 million lives have been saved so far, this has come to less than $4 per life saved \u2014 significantly superior to all interventions in the DCP2. Moreover, the eradication also saved significant amounts of money. Approximately $70 million was being spent across developing countries per year in routine vaccination and treatment for smallpox, and more than $1,000 million was lost per year in reduced productivity.<fn><sup id=\"fnref7\"><a href=\"#fn7\" rel=\"footnote\">[7]</a></sup></fn> Even just in the United States, smallpox vaccination and vigilance cost $150 million per year before eradication.<fn><sup id=\"fnref8\"><a href=\"#fn8\" rel=\"footnote\">[8]</a></sup></fn> The eradication programme thus saved more lives per year than are lost due to war, while saving money for both donors and recipients, paying back its entire costs every few months. It serves as an excellent proof of just how cost-effective global health can be.</p>\n<h1>The moral case</h1>\n<p>In these examples, we have seen how incredibly variable cost-effectiveness can be within global health. The least effective intervention in the HIV/AIDS case produces less than 0.1% of the value of the most effective, and if we are willing to look at different kinds of disease, this fraction drops to less than 0.01%. Ignoring cost-effectiveness thus does not mean losing 10% or 20% of the potential value that a health budget could have achieved, but can easily mean losing 99% or more. Even choosing the median intervention can involve losing 85% of the potential value.</p>\n<p>In practical terms, this can mean hundreds, thousands, or millions of additional deaths due to failure to prioritize. In non-life-saving contexts it means thousands or millions of people with untreated disabling conditions.</p>\n<p>Even when other ethical issues in global health are very important in absolute terms, they are typically much smaller than this. For instance, it may be worse on equity grounds to treat a million people in a relatively affluent city than to treat the same number of people spread between the city and the relatively much poorer rural areas. However, it is not vastly worse \u2014 not so bad that 99% of the value is lost.</p>\n<p>Learning how to correctly factor these other ethical issues into our decision making is an important and challenging problem, but we are currently failing at a much more basic, more obvious, and more important problem: choosing to help more people instead of fewer people, to produce a larger health benefit instead of a smaller one.</p>\n<h1>Challenges addressed</h1>\n<p>Some people don\u2019t see cost-effectiveness as an ethical issue at all, since it is so cut and dried that it seems like a mere implementation issue. This is misguided. People who decide how to spend health budgets hold the lives or livelihoods of many other people in their hands. They are literally making life-or-death decisions. Most decisions of this sort take dramatically insufficient account of cost-effectiveness. As a result, thousands or millions of people die who otherwise would have lived. The few are saved at the expense of the many. It is typically done out of ignorance about the significance of the cost-effectiveness landscape rather than out of prejudice, but the effects are equally serious.</p>\n<p>Some object that consequences are not the only thing that matters. For example, some people think that acting virtuously or avoiding violating rights matters too. However, all plausible ethical theories hold that consequences are an important input into moral decision-making, particularly when considering life or death situations, or those affecting thousands of people. Indeed these are precisely the types of cases in which people think that it may even become permissible to violate rights. However, in the cases under consideration, there is not even a conflict between producing a much greater good and acting virtuously or avoiding violating people\u2019s rights. The consequences are thus of great moral importance, with no serious moral factors counting in the opposite direction. Proponents of all ethical theories should therefore agree about the moral importance of funding the most cost-effective interventions.</p>\n<p>People might also be concerned about the particular choices involved in estimating the benefits of different health interventions. For example, they may disagree about particular disability weights, or about the method for eliciting these weights, or about discounting health benefits, or weighting benefits depending on the age of the recipients, or whether other issues such as equality need to be factored in. However, none of this is in serious disagreement with the thrust of this note. Indeed I personally have many of the same concerns, but as mentioned earlier the practical choices we face often involve factors of ten or more between different interventions, so none of the modifications mentioned here will change the rankings very much. People who are concerned about the details of measuring cost-effectiveness should join with the cost-effectiveness community in improving these measures, rather than throwing out the baby with the bathwater, and leading to thousands of unnecessary deaths.</p>\n<p>Another reason people might be initially suspicious of prioritisation based on cost-effectiveness is through confusing it with cost-benefit analysis (CBA). The latter is an economic method for prioritisation which involves determining the benefits for each person in terms of how many dollars they would be willing to pay, adding these up, and then dividing by the total costs in order to produce a benefit-cost ratio in units of dollars per dollar. This method is ethically suspect as it considers benefits to wealthy people (or groups) to be worth more than comparable benefits to poorer people (or groups) since the wealthy are willing to pay more for a given benefit.</p>\n<p>However, the cost-effectiveness I have discussed in this note is very different, and is a type of analysis known as cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA). This doesn\u2019t convert benefits into dollars, but just provides a raw measure of the benefits in units such as DALYs per dollar, or lives saved per dollar. Thus the wealth of the recipients is not an input to the analysis and it doesn\u2019t discriminate towards interventions that favour the wealthy.</p>\n<p>People might remain suspicious of cost-effectiveness since it makes a connection between dollars and health (or even life itself). Making trade-offs between so-called sacred values such as life with non-sacred values such as money strikes many people as morally problematic. However, no such trade-off is made in cost-effectiveness analysis. Instead there is a budget constraint of some fixed number of dollars. The cost-effectiveness ratios help one to see how much benefit could be causally produced if this money were spent on different interventions \u2014 for example, saving one thousand lives or saving ten thousand lives. The only comparison that is made is between these benefits. Whether or not it is worth spending the budget to save ten thousand lives is not part of the analysis.</p>\n<h1>Conclusions</h1>\n<p>In many cases ignoring cost-effectiveness in global health means losing almost all the value that we could create. Thus there is a moral imperative to fund the most cost-effective interventions. This doesn\u2019t simply mean implementing the current interventions in the most cost-effective way possible, for the improvements that can be gained within a single intervention are quite small in comparison. It also doesn\u2019t just mean doing retrospective measures of the cost-effectiveness of the interventions you fund as part of programme evaluation. Instead, it means actively searching the landscape of interventions that you are allowed to fund and diverting the bulk of the funds to the very best interventions. Ideally it also means expanding the domain of interventions under consideration to include all those which have been analysed.</p>\n<p>The main effect of understanding the moral imperative towards cost-effectiveness is spending our budgets so as to produce greater health benefits, saving many more lives and preventing or treating more disabling conditions. However, it also shows a very interesting fact about global health funding. If we can save one thousand lives with one intervention and ten thousand with another at an equal price, then merely moving our funding from the first to the second saves nine thousand lives. Thus merely moving funding from one intervention to a more cost-effective one can produce almost as much benefit as adding an equal amount of additional funding.</p>\n<p>This is unintuitive since it isn\u2019t the case when one option is merely 10% or 30% better than another. However, when one option is 10 times or 100 times better, as is often the case in global health, redirecting funding is so important that it is almost as good as adding new funding directly towards the superior intervention. In times of global austerity and shrinking budgets, it is good to know how much more can be done within existing ones.</p>\n<h1>Endnotes:</h1>\n<ol><li id=\"fn1\">\n<p>Guide Dogs of America estimate $19,000 for the training of the dog.

These interventions appear to solve certain problems (malaria,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://givewell.org/international/technical/programs/deworming\">parasites</a>) quite well, while making no direct attempt to solve other problems (economic growth, education, gender equity, and more). One of the common lines of objection we get to these recommendations goes something like: &#x201C;Why should I put all my money into fighting malaria, ignoring other important problems? Isn&#x2019;t it unethical to ignore the other essential needs?&#x201D;</p>\n<p>We believe this objection commits the common fallacy of&#xA0;<strong>viewing the developed-world donor as the only person who can improve things for the beneficiaries.</strong>&#xA0;One term for taking this mentality too far is &#x201C;<a href=\"http://goodintents.org/media-and-charitable-advertising/whites-in-shining-armour\">Whites in Shining Armor</a>&#x201D; &#x2013; often, in the media and in nonprofits&#x2019; communications, global poverty is presented as a simple fight between local problems and developed-world heroes. The problem is that as outsiders, we often have<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2009/02/21/the-root-causes-of-poverty/\">very poor understanding of the true dynamics behind overseas problems</a>&#xA0;&#x2013; and by attempting to solve problems that we understand poorly,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://www.povertyactionlab.org/evaluation/finding-missing-markets-agricultural-brokerage-intervention-kenya\">we can make things worse</a>.</p>\n<p>We fundamentally believe that&#xA0;<strong>progress on most problems must be locally driven.</strong>&#xA0;So we seek to improve people&#x2019;s abilities to make progress on their own, rather than taking personal responsibility for each of their challenges. How can we best accomplish this?</p>\n<h1>Locally driven projects</h1>\n<p><span>A common and intuitively appealing answer is&#xA0;</span><strong>letting locals drive philanthropic projects.</strong><span>This answer has some appeal for us; we have written before about, and given a small amount of money to,&#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/05/04/evaluating-local-charities-in-india/\">&#x201C;low-insulation charities&#x201D;</a><span>&#xA0;that seem adaptive, locally connected, and overall driven by local needs rather than donors&#x2019; plans.

I try to help my friends and family in domains that I&#x2019;m relatively knowledgeable about (for example, computer issues) and I tend not to put much effort into helping in other areas I&#x2019;m not so knowledgeable about (for example, picking clothes) even if the latter are more important issues for them. I know I appreciate when my friends and family deal with me this way, and I don&#x2019;t appreciate people who are determined to help me in domains that they don&#x2019;t understand very well (even if these domains are very important to me).</p>\n<p>We believe that&#xA0;<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2009/02/18/aids-track-record/\">the track record of outside aid</a>&#xA0;points to&#xA0;<a href=\"http://blog.givewell.org/2011/12/22/my-favorite-cause-for-individual-donors-global-health-and-nutrition/\">health and nutrition</a>&#xA0;as the areas that developed-world outsiders understand best and are best-positioned to help with.</p>\n<p>It&#x2019;s not that we think global health and nutrition are the only important, or even the most important, problems in the developing world. It&#x2019;s that we&#x2019;re trying to focus on what we can do well, and thus maximally empower people to make locally-driven progress on other fronts.</p>\n<h1>Cash transfers</h1>\n<p><span>One more approach to &#x201C;putting locals in the driver&#x2019;s seat&#x201D;:&#xA0;</span><a href=\"http://www.givewell.org/international/charities/give-directly\">give to GiveDirectly to support unconditional cash transfers</a><span>. We feel that global health and nutrition interventions are superior because they reach so many more people (per dollar), but for those who are even more concerned than we are about the trap of &#x201C;whites in shining armor,&#x201D; this option has some promise.

After all they have choices, they can give that same dollar to another charity. Donors want their donations to go as far as possible&#x2026;&#x201D;</p>\n<p>There are two fatal errors here. The first is that high administrative efficiency equals high impact. It doesn&#x2BC;t. The second is that the admin-to-program ratio is measuring efficiency. <strong>If it isn&#x2BC;t measuring impact, it&#x2BC;s axiomatic that it isn&#x2BC;t measuring efficiency</strong>, because the only efficiency that matters is the efficiency associated with impact. Take the frugal breast cancer charity that consistently fails to find a cure for breast cancer. The last word a woman dying of breast cancer would use to describe it would be &#x201C;efficient.&#x201D; Not if she factors in the value of her life.</p>\n<p>As for making donations &#x201C;go as far as possible,&#x201D; consider two soup kitchens. Soup kitchen A reports that 90% of every donation goes to the cause. Soup Kitchen B reports 70%. You should donate to A, right? No-brainer. Unless you actually visited the two and found that the so-called more &#x201C;efficient&#x201D; Soup Kitchen A serves rancid soup in a dilapidated building with an unpleasant staff and is closed half the time, while Soup Kitchen B is open 24/7, and has a super-friendly staff that serves nutritious soup in a state-of-the-art facility.&#xA0;<strong>Now</strong>&#xA0;which looks better? The admin: program ratio would have failed you completely. It betrays your trust. It&#x2BC;s utterly&#xA0;<strong>deficient</strong>&#xA0;in data about which soup kitchen is better at serving soup. It undermines your compassion and insults your contribution. And yet we praise it as a yardstick of morality and trustworthiness. It&#x2BC;s the exact opposite.</p>\n<p>We should stop saying charities with low ratios are efficient. Efficient at what? Fundraising? &#x201C;Inefficient&#x201D; &#x2014; as in expedient &#x2014; fundraising may accelerate problem-solving, making its &#x201C;inefficiency&#x201D; efficient in the big picture. Say Jonas Salk spent $50 million to raise $100 million to find a polio vaccine. The admin:program ratio would report he had a shameful 50% overhead. But the $100 million he raised wasn&#x2BC;t his end result. His end result was a vaccine. Divide the $50 million fundraising expense into the God-only-knows-how-many billions of dollars a polio vaccine is worth, and his overhead ratio at eradicating polio is 0%. A hypothetical competing charity with 10% fundraising cost that comes up empty on a vaccine has&#xA0;<strong>100% overhead&#xA0;</strong>against the goal of a vaccine, because it never found one. But it&#x2BC;s labeled the more &#x201C;efficient&#x201D; charity. As one of millions who dodged polio because of Salk, I&#x2BC;d have to disagree.</p>\n<p>Let&#x2BC;s get unhypothetical. In 1995,&#xA0;<a href=\"http://phrusa.org/\">Physicians for Human Rights</a>&#xA0;had revenues of approximately $1.3 million. They spent approximately $750,000, or 58 percent of revenues, on programs. Today that organization would fail all of the watchdog standards for &#x201C;efficiency.&#x201D; It would be ineligible for a BBB Wise Giving Alliance seal of approval. The Nobel Peace Prize committee felt differently. Physicians for Human Rights won the Nobel Prize in 1997 for its work as a founding member of the International Campaign to Ban Landmines.</p>\n<p>Imagine coming out of a shoe store with a brand new pair of shoes full of holes, and whispering to your friends, &#x201C;You wouldn&#x2BC;t believe how low the overhead was on these shoes.&#x201D; That&#x2BC;s exactly what Americans are doing with hundreds of billions of annual charitable donations.

To wade in and pull the child out would be easy, but it will mean that you get your clothes wet and muddy, and by the time you go home and change you will have missed your first class.</p><p>I then ask the students: Do you have any obligation to rescue the child?&nbsp;</p><p>Unanimously, the students say they do. The importance of saving a child so far outweighs the cost of getting one\u2019s clothes muddy and missing a class that they refuse to consider it any kind of excuse for not saving the child.&nbsp;</p><p>Does it make a difference, I ask, that there are other people walking past the pond who would equally be able to rescue the child but are not doing so?&nbsp;</p><p>No, the students reply, the fact that others are not doing what they ought to do is no reason why we should not do what we ought to do.</p><p>Once we are all clear about our obligations to rescue the drowning child in front of us, I ask: Would it make any difference if the child were far away, in another country perhaps, but similarly in danger of death, and equally within your means to save, at no great cost \u2014 and absolutely no danger \u2014 to yourself?&nbsp;</p><p>Virtually all agree that distance and nationality make no moral difference to the situation.&nbsp;</p><p>I then point out that we are all in that situation of the person passing the shallow pond. We can all save the lives of people, both children and adults, who would otherwise die, and we can do so at a very small cost to us: the cost of a new CD, a shirt, or a night out at a restaurant or concert, can mean the difference between life and death to more than one person somewhere in the world. And overseas aid agencies like Oxfam overcome the problem of acting at a distance.</p><p>At this point, the students raise various practical difficulties. Can we be sure that our donation will really get to the people who need it? Doesn\u2019t most aid get swallowed up in administrative costs, or waste, or downright corruption? Isn\u2019t the real problem the growing world population, and is there any point in saving lives until the problem has been solved?&nbsp;</p><p>These questions can all be answered. But I also point out that even if a substantial proportion of our donations were wasted, the cost to us of making the donation is so small \u2014 compared to the benefits that it provides when it, or some of it, does get through to those who need our help \u2014 that we would still be saving lives at a small cost to ourselves, even if aid organizations were much less efficient than they actually are.</p><p>****</p><p>I am always struck by how few students challenge the underlying ethics of the idea that we ought to save the lives of strangers when we can do so at relatively little cost to ourselves. At the end of the nineteenth century, W.E.H. Lecky <a href=\"https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/39535\"><u>wrote of human concern</u></a> as an expanding circle which begins with the individual, then embraces the family and \u2018soon the circle ... includes first a class, then a nation, then a coalition of nations, then all humanity, and finally, its influence is felt in the dealings of man [sic] with the animal world\u2019. On this basis, the overwhelming majority of my students seem to be already in the penultimate stage \u2014 at least \u2014 of Lecky\u2019s expanding circle.&nbsp;</p><p>There is, of course, for many students and for various reasons, a gap between acknowledging what we ought to do and actually doing it. But I shall come back to that issue shortly.</p><p>Our century is the first in which it has been possible to speak of global responsibility and a global community. For most of human history, we could affect the people in our village, or perhaps in a large city, but even a powerful king could not conquer far beyond the borders of his kingdom. When Hadrian ruled the Roman Empire, his realm covered most of the \u2018known\u2019 world. Today, when I board a jet in London leaving what used to be one of the far-flung outposts of the Roman Empire, I pass over its opposite boundary before I am even halfway to Singapore, let alone to my home in Australia.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, no matter what the extent of the empire, the time required for communications and transport meant that there was simply no way in which people could make any difference to the victims of floods, wars, or massacres taking place on the other side of the globe. By the time anyone had heard of the events and responded, the victims were dead or had survived without assistance. \u2018Charity begins at home\u2019 made sense, because it was only \u2018at home\u2019 \u2014 or at least in your own town \u2014 that you could be confident that your charity would make any difference.</p><p>Instant communications and jet transport have changed all that. A television audience of two billion people can now watch hungry children beg for food in an area struck by famine, or they can see refugees streaming across the border in search of a safe place away from those they fear will kill them. Most of that huge audience also have the means to help the people they are seeing on their screens. Each one of us can pull out a credit card and phone in a donation to an aid organization which can, in a few days, fly in people who can begin distributing food and medical supplies. Collectively, it is also within the capacity of the United Nations \u2014 with the support of major powers \u2014 to put troops on the ground to protect those who are in danger of becoming victims of genocide.</p><p>Our capacity to affect what is happening, anywhere in the world, is one way in which we are living in an era of global responsibility. But there is also another way that offers an even more dramatic contrast with the past. The atmosphere and the oceans seemed, until recently, to be elements of nature totally unaffected by the puny activities of human beings. Now we know that our use of chlorofluorocarbons has damaged the ozone shield; our emission of carbon dioxide is changing the climate of the entire planet in unpredictable ways and raising the level of the sea; and fishing fleets are scouring the oceans, depleting fish populations that once seemed limitless to a point from which they may never recover. In these ways, the actions of consumers in Los Angeles can cause skin cancer among Australians, inundate the lands of peasants in Bangladesh, and force Thai villagers who could once earn a living by fishing to work in the factories of Bangkok.</p><p>****</p><p>In these circumstances, the need for a global ethic is inescapable. Is it nevertheless a vain hope? Here are some reasons why it may not be.</p><p>We live in a time when many people experience their lives as empty and lacking in fulfilment. The decline of religion and the collapse of communism have left but the ideology of the free market, whose only message is: Consume, and work hard so you can earn money to consume more. Yet even those who do reasonably well in this race for material goods do not find that they are satisfied with their way of life. We now have good scientific evidence for what philosophers have said throughout the ages: Once we have enough to satisfy our basic needs, gaining more wealth does not bring us more happiness.</p><p>[...]</p><p>We tend to see ethics as opposed to self-interest. We assume that those who make fortunes from insider trading are successfully following self-interest \u2014 as long as they don\u2019t get caught \u2014 and ignoring ethics. We think that it is in our interest to take a more senior better-paid position with another company, even though it means that we are helping to manufacture or promote a product that does no good at all, or is environmentally damaging. On the other hand, those who pass up opportunities to rise in their career because of ethical \u2018scruples\u2019 about the nature of the work, or who give away their wealth to good causes, are thought to be sacrificing their own interest in order to obey the dictates of ethics.</p><p>Many will say that it is naive to believe that people could shift from a life based on consumption, or on getting on top of the corporate ladder, to one that is more ethical in its fundamental direction. But such a shift would answer a palpable need. Today the assertion that life is meaningless no longer comes from existentialist philosophers who treat it as a shocking discovery: It comes from bored adolescents for whom it is a truism. Perhaps it is the central place of self-interest, and the way in which we conceive of our own interest, that is to blame here. The pursuit of self-interest, as standardly conceived, is a life without any meaning beyond our own pleasure or individual satisfaction. Such a life is often a self-defeating enterprise. The ancients knew of the \u2018paradox of hedonism,\u2019 according to which the more explicitly we pursue our desire for pleasure, the more elusive we will find its satisfaction. There is no reason to believe that human nature has changed so dramatically as to render the ancient wisdom inapplicable.</p><p>Here ethics offer a solution. An ethical life is one in which we identify ourselves with other, larger goals, thereby giving meaning to our lives. The view that there is harmony between ethics and enlightened self-interest is an ancient one, now often scorned. Cynicism is more fashionable than idealism. But such hopes are not groundless, and there are substantial elements of truth in the ancient view that an ethically reflective life is also a good life for the person leading it. Never has it been so urgent that the reasons for accepting this view should be widely understood.</p><p>In a society in which the narrow pursuit of material self-interest is the norm, the shift to an ethical stance is more radical than many people realize. In comparison with the needs of people going short of food in Rwanda, the desire to sample the wines of Australia\u2019s best vineyards pales into insignificance. An ethical approach to life does not forbid having fun or enjoying food and wine; but it changes our sense of priorities. The effort and expense put into fashion, the endless search for more and more refined gastronomic pleasures, the added expense that marks out the luxury-car market \u2014 all these become disproportionate to people who can shift perspective long enough to put themselves in the position of others affected by their actions. If the circle of ethics really does expand, and a higher ethical consciousness spreads, it will fundamentally change the society in which we live.</p>", "user": {"username": "Peter_Singer"}}, {"_id": "pDFxaHQssgZnqkFP7", "title": "Meetup : Meetup for effective altruists", "postedAt": "2014-09-09T01:58:37.920Z", "htmlBody": "<html><body><h2>Discussion article for the meetup : <a href=\"/meetups/4\">Meetup for effective altruists</a></h2>\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHEN:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>09 September 2014 11:55:11AM (+1000)</span><br>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t\t\t<p>\n\t\t    \t<strong>WHERE:</strong> \n\t\t    \t<span>malvern east, victoria, australia</span>\n\t\t\t\t</p>\n\t\t  </div><!-- .meta -->\n\t\t  <div>\n\t\t    <div><p>Welcome to the meetups page.
