Se avete competenze in questi ambiti e volete partecipare,&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:wjbrad@mit.edu\">contattatemi</a>.</p><p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> Quando parlo di \u201ctecnici\u201d in questo post faccio riferimento esclusivamente a&nbsp;<strong>sistemi fisici&nbsp;</strong>(ad esempio ingegneria civile o dei materiali). Mi spiace, tecnici informatici, sar\u00e0 per la prossima volta.</p><h1>Il problema</h1><p>Tradizionalmente, il mondo della biosicurezza, affine all\u2019altruismo efficace, \u00e8 stato dominato da persone con un background in biologia, epidemiologia, medicina e politiche pubbliche. La maggior parte delle matricole che stanno pensando di lavorare nel campo della biosicurezza vengono a loro volta da questi ambienti. A conti fatti, sono queste le persone che secondo la comunit\u00e0 dell\u2019Altruismo Efficace possono dare il loro contributo nel campo della biosicurezza.</p><p>Ha senso: lo sviluppo di minacce biologiche \u00e8 un problema politico e sociale e le stesse minacce sono, beh, biologiche, per cui \u00e8 lecito pensare che persone con competenze in biologia e medicina siano bene istruite per pensare alle contromisure. Per affrontare una minaccia alla biosicurezza, tutti questi campi di competenza sono necessari.</p><p>Il problema \u00e8 che&nbsp;<strong>molti degli interventi pi\u00f9 importanti per ridurre il rischio di catastrofe biologica non sono di natura n\u00e9 biologica, n\u00e9 sociale</strong>. Al contrario, questi interventi si avvalgono di mezzi fisici per bloccare, catturare o distruggere i patogeni. Queste tecnologie sono molto pi\u00f9 neutrali nei confronti delle minacce rispetto alla maggior parte degli interventi con una base biotecnologica. Forniscono un'ampia protezione e hanno bisogno di molta meno ricerca a duplice uso e modelli di minacce sensibili a un rischio legato alle informazioni.</p><p>Pi\u00f9 che biologi e policymaker, <strong>le persone pi\u00f9 adatte a guidare questi interventi sono gli scienziati dei materiali, gli ingegneri edili e altre persone con un ricco background nel campo delle scienze fisiche applicate</strong>. Purtroppo per noi, le persone con questo tipo di competenze al momento sono in grande carenza nel campo della biosicurezza.</p><h1>Gli interventi</h1><p>Le persone con competenze nel campo delle scienze fisiche applicate possono avere un impatto sulla biosicurezza in molti modi. Di seguito ho elencato alcuni di quelli pi\u00f9 prominenti e/o importanti per me, ma sono sicuro che ce ne sono altri a cui non ho ancora pensato.</p><p>(Per saperne di pi\u00f9 su questi e altri entusiasmanti interventi tecnologici, leggete l\u2019Appendice A del<a href=\"https://biodefensecommission.org/reports/the-apollo-program-for-biodefense-winning-the-race-against-biological-threats/\">&nbsp;Programma Apollo per la Biodifesa (in inglese)</a>.)</p><h2><strong>Protezione fisica dai patogeni</strong></h2><p>Come ho detto, gli interventi sulla biosicurezza pi\u00f9 importanti su cui i tecnici possono lavorare sono quelli che hanno come obiettivo quello di impedire agli agenti patogeni di introdursi nelle persone prima ancora di causare la malattia. In ordine di importanza decrescente, troviamo:</p><ul><li><strong>Migliorare i dispositivi di protezione individuale (DPI):</strong> La forma delle mascherine facciali e di altri DPI<a href=\"https://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/our-work/publications/masks-and-respirators-for-the-21st-century\">&nbsp;\u00e8 rimasta pressoch\u00e9 invariata da decenni</a> e riceve ancora poca attenzione. Un DPI che sia estremamente efficace, facile da usare e poco costoso da distribuire sarebbe l'intervento tecnologico pi\u00f9 significativo per superare i rischi biologici. Peccato che al momento questo ambito sia cos\u00ec incredibilmente trascurato.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Impedire la diffusione di patogeni in ambienti chiusi:</strong> Quando si parla di trasmissione di infezioni respiratorie, gli spazi al chiuso sono molto pi\u00f9 pericolosi di quelli esterni. Interventi che riducano la trasmissibilit\u00e0 all'interno degli edifici, per quanto non adattabili o potenti come il miglioramento dei DPI, potrebbero rallentare in maniera significativa la diffusione di minacce biologiche pericolose. Tra gli&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cen.acs.org/biological-chemistry/infectious-disease/air-purification-technologies-tackle-COVID/99/i9\">interventi proposti</a> in questo campo ci sono una ventilazione interna migliorata,<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-67211-2\"> l'irradiazione con raggi UVC profondi</a>&nbsp;e&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/ventilation/uvgi.html\"><u>l'irradiazione con UVGI della parte superiore delle stanze</u></a>. Tuttavia, molti di questi interventi presentano difficolt\u00e0 non da poco che ne impediscono la diffusione e non viene investito molto denaro o tempo per implementare queste tecnologie o trovare delle alternative promettenti.</li><li><strong>Migliorare la biosicurezza in cliniche e laboratori ad alto contenimento:</strong> Esattamente come per i DPI nell'uso generico, le tecnologie e i sistemi impiegati nel mantenere la biosicurezza all'interno dei laboratori ad alto contenimento e dei reparti d'isolamento sono vecchie di decenni e lente a cambiare. Anche se meno importanti dei DPI, migliorare le altre tecnologie e processi impiegati per contenere i patogeni ad alto rischio aiuterebbe a prevenire contaminazioni accidentali.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Impedire la diffusione di patogeni all'interno dei veicoli:</strong> Molti degli stessi principi per ridurre la diffusione all'interno degli edifici si possono applicare a veicoli di grandi dimensioni, come aerei e navi da crociera. Per quanto possa sembrare molto meno importante rispetto al rendere gli edifici a prova di pandemia, ha comunque la sua importanza.</li></ul><p>Tutti questi interventi hanno in comune il fatto di essere molto generici, relativamente economici e assurdamente trascurati rispetto a quelle elaborate contromisure biotecnologiche. In generale,&nbsp;<strong>come civilt\u00e0, non ci siamo impegnati granch\u00e9 per far funzionare questi interventi</strong>, ma se lo facessimo, l'impatto positivo potrebbe essere enorme.</p><h2><strong>Migliorare la tecnologia alla base del biomonitoraggio</strong></h2><p>Anche se quello che mi entusiasma di pi\u00f9 \u00e8 vedere persone con background tecnici lavorare a tecnologie di protezione fisica, ci sono molti altri interventi sulla biosicurezza che trarrebbero vantaggi significativi dall'avere pi\u00f9 persone con competenze tecniche che lavorano assieme agli scienziati per migliorare le tecnologie per la biosicurezza.</p><p>Ad esempio, implementare il biomonitoraggio metagenomico per individuare in anticipo le epidemie richieder\u00e0 notevoli progressi in molti campi per quel che riguarda la strumentazione, incluso un campionamento ambientale efficace e affidabile, un campionamento semplice dei momenti di cura, un processo di campionamento automatico e tecnologie per il sequenziamento.</p><p>A conti fatti, molte delle scienze della vita dipendono da strumenti che la maggior parte degli scienziati non comprendono a fondo, n\u00e9 sanno come costruire. Fintantoch\u00e9 questi strumenti saranno necessari per individuare o combattere minacce biologiche, avremo bisogno di tecnici e altri esperti che ci aiutino a costruirli.</p><h1>Come partecipare?</h1><p>Se pensate di avere le competenze e la motivazione necessarie per contribuire a uno qualsiasi di questi interventi, vi consiglio&nbsp;<i>vivamente&nbsp;</i>di&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:wjbrad@mit.edu\">contattarmi</a>, via email o per messaggio privato su questo forum. Non vedo l'ora di parlare soprattutto con persone che potrebbero lavorare a interventi sui DPI e sugli ambienti chiusi e conosco molti altri che sarebbero felicissimi di sostenere questo tipo di lavoro.</p><p>Se non siete tra queste, ma conoscete qualcuno che rientra nella descrizione, potrebbe essere una buona idea contattarlo per chiedergli di partecipare.</p><p>Ovviamente valgono gli stessi avvertimenti che valgono per la biosicurezza: \u00e8 un ambito ristretto con un sacco di fastidiose preoccupazioni di duplice uso e rischio legato alle informazioni, che rendono la ricerca di soluzioni molto pi\u00f9 difficile di quanto dovrebbe essere. Detto questo, \u00e8 anche un ambito stra-entusiasmante in cui lavorare in questo momento.</p><p>Se avete le giuste competenze e siete disposti a metterci la cura e l'attenzione necessaria per farvi strada in questi campi minati, con ogni probabilit\u00e0 questo potrebbe essere il massimo bene che potreste fare.</p>", "user": {"username": "EA Italy"}}, {"_id": "bxuNRtjywcXP5AfTz", "title": "[Opzionale] Progetti di biosicurezza concreti (alcuni con grandi potenzialit\u00e0)", "postedAt": "2023-01-12T03:06:35.601Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>This is an Italian translation of </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/u5JesqQ3jdLENXBtB/concrete-biosecurity-projects-some-of-which-could-be-big-1\"><i><strong>Concrete Biosecurity Projects (some of which could be big)</strong></i></a></p><p>Quello che segue \u00e8 un elenco di progetti di biosicurezza legati al lungoterminismo.

L\u2019attuale approccio nell\u2019individuazione di nuovi patogeni \u00e8 profondamente inadeguato: di solito richiede che un medico particolarmente sveglio si renda conto che c\u2019\u00e8 qualcosa di strano anche se i test per tutto il resto sono negativi. I sistemi attuali si concentrano quasi esclusivamente sui patogeni noti, ma un approccio di gran lunga migliore sarebbe usare un sistema neutro che possa individuare patogeni sconosciuti. All'atto pratico, un obiettivo semplice sarebbe quello di avere un piccolo gruppo di persone che raccoglie campioni volontari da viaggiatori da tutto il mondo e li analizza tramite sequenziamenti metagenomici completi alla ricerca di possibili minacce<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefva1j71mlte\"><sup><a href=\"#fnva1j71mlte\">[2]</a></sup></span>. Dal momento che con questo approccio ci aspettiamo di riuscire a individuare i patogeni prima che infettino una percentuale troppo alta della popolazione mondiale, raccogliere e analizzare anche solo 100 campioni casuali al giorno sarebbe una differenza significativa in alcuni casi. Con la squadra giusta e tecnologia simile a quella attuale, pensiamo che questa ricerca possa essere svolta con meno di 50 milioni di dollari all'anno<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefe74wham3wk\"><sup><a href=\"#fne74wham3wk\">[3]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>Questa proposta presenta un certo numero di ostacoli e una serie di soluzioni che si possono impiegare per superarli. Per quel che riguarda i problemi secondari, uno di noi (Ethan) sta mettendo assieme un elenco di suggerimenti. Appena sar\u00e0 pronto, metteremo il link qui.</p><h2>Super DPI (PPE)</h2><p>La maggior parte dei dispositivi di protezione individuale (DPI, in inglese personal protective equipment, PPE) presenta diversi difetti. Mascherine e tute di protezione richiedono un certo addestramento per essere indossate correttamente, non sono riutilizzabili e di solito sono pensate per situazioni di routine, piuttosto che per eventi estremi. Quella piccola percentuale di dispositivi di protezione pensata per situazioni estreme (ad esempio tute BSL4 o DPI ad uso militare) \u00e8 ingombrante, limita molto i movimenti e non viene prodotta in quantit\u00e0 sufficienti. Non \u00e8 il genere di attrezzatura con cui si potrebbero equipaggiare milioni di operatori sanitari o lavoratori essenziali in caso di necessit\u00e0. \u00c8 plausibile che, tramite la scienza dei materiali e un buon design dei prodotti, la prossima generazione di dispositivi di protezione sia altamente efficace in situazioni estreme, ma anche facile da usare, durevole nel tempo ed economica o disponibile in grandi quantit\u00e0.</p><p>Un obiettivo commerciale concreto potrebbe essere quello di produrre una tuta con relativo sistema pensata per permettere a persone con immunodeficienza grave di vivere vite relativamente normali, con un costo abbastanza basso da convincere il governo degli Stati Uniti ad acquistarne 100 milioni per lo Strategic National Stockpile<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefpifdq269jwb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnpifdq269jwb\">[4]</a></sup></span>. Un altro obiettivo potrebbe essere quello di avere una tuta che rispetti gli standard dell'esercito, come ad esempio proteggere da un attacco con l'antrace.</p><p>Il vantaggio dei dispositivi di protezione individuale \u00e8 che, quando si parla di patogeni, sono davvero \"neutri\": possiamo farne scorta ancora prima di sapere quale sar\u00e0 la minaccia, cosa che non possiamo fare con i vaccini o con molte contromisure sanitarie. Si tratta anche di una \"difesa stabile\", dal momento che barriere fisiche come i DPI non possono essere superate facilmente utilizzando tecniche di bioingegnerizzazione (al contrario di molte contromisure sanitarie che potrebbero essere&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/F4KS4zCFfm3p6NtrR/countermeasures-and-substitution-effects-in-biosecurity\">neutralizzate </a>lavorandoci un po\u2019 sopra). Per approfondire puoi dare un\u2019occhiata a <a href=\"http://reflectivedisequilibrium.blogspot.com/2020/05/what-would-civilization-immune-to.html\">questo&nbsp;</a>post di Carl Shulman.</p><p>Per quel che riguarda i problemi secondari dei DPI, uno di noi (Ethan) pubblicher\u00e0 un approfondimento sui DPI nel prossimo futuro (il link sar\u00e0 presto disponibile).</p><h2>Contromisure sanitarie</h2><p>Le contromisure sanitarie (vaccini, farmaci antivirali, anticorpi monoclonali) in caso di rischio biologico comportano attualmente una serie di lati negativi. Nella maggior parte dei casi sono sviluppati su misura contro patogeni gi\u00e0 noti (ad esempio i vaccini contro il vaiolo) e non sarebbero di aiuto contro nuove minacce. Molte contromisure non sono poi efficaci in caso di ingegnerizzazione dei patogeni (gli antibiotici, ad esempio, sono ad ampio spettro, ma possono essere&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plVk4NVIUh8\">neutralizzati</a>).</p><p>Secondo noi ci potrebbero essere&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rjFJYREBZZscvDwLu/a-framework-for-technical-progress-on-biosecurity\">opportunit\u00e0 </a>per lo sviluppo e il miglioramento di contromisure sanitarie per minacce di categoria GCBR (<i>Global Catastrophe Biological Risk</i>, rischio biologico di catastrofe globale). Le possibilit\u00e0 sono due: 1) sviluppare contromisure mirate a minacce che suscitano particolare preoccupazione (oppure contromisure ad ampio spettro per un'intera categoria di minacce); 2) creare piattaforme di risposta rapida che siano affidabili anche contro minacce intenzionali.</p><p>Non ci sentiamo tuttavia pronti a consigliare le contromisure sanitarie come obiettivo generale per progetti su larga scala, in parte perch\u00e9 molti progetti in questo ambito comportano effetti collaterali involontari (ad esempio, le piattaforme che usano vettori virali potrebbero&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264410X21001717\">accelerare </a>lo sviluppo dell'ingegnerizzazione virale). Se ti piacerebbe lavorare in quest'ambito, compila il modulo Google (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc5Lao8hdqFU49ojhPW7TiM5aCTAJ0H1_qBzINAonHTyS951w/viewform?usp=sf_link\">qui</a>) e ci metteremo in contatto con te per darti qualche consiglio su misura.</p><h2>Miglioramento della Convenzione per le Armi Biologiche</h2><p>La <a href=\"https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convenzione_per_le_armi_biologiche\">Convenzione per le Armi Biologiche</a>, il trattato internazionale che vieta l'uso di armi biologiche, \u00e8 attualmente gestita da sole quattro persone e non c'\u00e8 modo di <a href=\"https://globalbiodefense.com/2021/09/23/nobody-is-checking-for-violations-of-the-biological-weapons-convention/\">verificare </a>che i firmatari ne rispettino le regole. Secondo noi c'\u00e8 spazio di manovra per rendere pi\u00f9 solida la convenzione in maniera creativa (ad esempio premi per i dipendenti che segnalano le irregolarit\u00e0) o per la formulazione di nuovi accordi bilaterali che evitino stalli burocratici. Non solo, una squadra addetta all'analisi di documenti di libera consultazione, come archivi di pubblicazioni, annunci di lavoro e catene di approvvigionamento, potrebbe far s\u00ec che per un laboratorio sia pi\u00f9 difficile eseguire di nascosto esperimenti illeciti, contribuendo in questo modo a rendere pi\u00f9 efficace la convenzione.</p><h2>Tecnologie per la sterilizzazione</h2><p>Le tecniche di sterilizzazione che si basano su principi fisici (come le radiazioni ionizzanti) o propriet\u00e0 antisettiche generiche (come l'acqua ossigenata o la candeggina), piuttosto che su particolarit\u00e0 a livello molecolare (come antibiotici gram-negativi), hanno il vantaggio di poter essere utilizzate in diversi contesti, sono difficili da neutralizzare e hanno minimi effetti collaterali in caso di utilizzo combinato.</p><p>Le attuali tecnologie di sterilizzazione fisica (come le <a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-21058-w\">luci UV </a>o la scienza dei materiali che sviluppa superfici antimicrobiche) hanno limiti diversi in termini di costo, comodit\u00e0 e praticit\u00e0. Per questo pensiamo che, quando si parla di sviluppare contromisure e metodi di prevenzione, questo sia un ambito poco esplorato. Ci sono ancora molte cose su cui non siamo sicuri, ma vale decisamente la pena di indagare.</p><h2>Rifugi</h2><p>I bunker gi\u00e0 esistenti forniscono un certo grado di protezione, ma un ulteriore miglioramento potrebbe essere la costruzione di rifugi pensati appositamente per pandemie catastrofiche (come ad esempio squadre di operatori sanitari che a rotazione entrano ed escono per condurre test sui nuovi patogeni, una sorta di \"kit di riavvio della civilt\u00e0\", magari anche con la possibilit\u00e0 di sviluppare e implementare contromisure biologiche in quello spazio protetto). Si tratterebbe di un modo efficace per avere sempre una parte della popolazione in quarantena preventiva.</p><p>Un altro punto di vista: secondo molte persone (e noi in pratica siamo d'accordo con loro), potremmo ridurre drasticamente il rischio biologico se avessimo un insediamento autonomo su Marte. In questo caso, sarebbe molto meno dispendioso avere lo stesso tipo di infrastruttura sulla Terra, dal momento che fornisce quasi lo stesso livello di protezione.</p><p>Il passo successivo sarebbe quello di fondare un'organizzazione specializzata nel gestire le operazioni, la logistica e le relazioni con gli appaltatori che servono per costruire un rifugio con tutto il necessario (uno di noi, ASB, ha condotto un'indagine superficiale e ha stimato i costi a circa 100-300 milioni di dollari per bunker, ma non aveva n\u00e9 il tempo n\u00e9 le conoscenze della logistica necessarie per indagare pi\u00f9 a fondo). Pi\u00f9 avanti metteremo qui dei link ad altre idee su cui stiamo ancora lavorando.

Il limite maggiore potrebbero essere proprio i talenti in ambito dirigenziale, fondamentali per distribuire efficacemente le risorse e gli altri talenti.</li><li>Per molti degli interventi pi\u00f9 promettenti, un possibile collo di bottiglia non riguarda conoscenze specialistiche di biologia o bioingegnerizzazione. Gli altruisti efficaci con conoscenze specialistiche che vogliano lavorare in questo campo dovrebbero prendere in considerazione l'idea di formarsi in altri <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Bd7K4XCg4BGEaSetp/biosecurity-needs-engineers-and-materials-scientists\">ambiti ingegneristici</a>. In generale, \u00e8 consigliabile sviluppare competenze di ingegneria generale e di<i> problem-solving</i>, piuttosto che concentrarsi solo su nozioni di biologia.</li><li>Dal momento che questi progetti hanno cicli di retroazione positivi (perlomeno rispetto alla maggior parte degli interventi lungoterministi), questo ambito \u00e8 un campo di sperimentazione ideale per meta-interventi di AE, soprattutto per quelli imprenditoriali.</li></ul><p>Per quanto alcuni di questi progetti di biosicurezza ci sembrino promettenti e scalabili, non pensiamo che la biosicurezza debba per forza diventare una parte molto pi\u00f9 grande del lavoro lungoterminista rispetto a quanto \u00e8 gi\u00e0. Da un punto di vista strettamente lungoterminista, pensiamo che l'intelligenza artificiale possa essere da 10 a 100 volte pi\u00f9 importante della biosicurezza, anche se risolvere problemi di biosicurezza potrebbe essere pi\u00f9 gestibile rispetto a risolvere quelli legati all'IA (forse di un fattore piuttosto grande). La biosicurezza genera interesse come area di intervento anche per ragioni non lungoterministe, data l'importanza del prevenire catastrofi minori che non porteranno al collasso della civilt\u00e0, ma sono comunque orrende (vedi ad esempio un COVID 10-100 volte peggiore).

L\u2019impatto sui pi\u00f9 poveri e sulla biodiversit\u00e0 del pianeta \u00e8 particolarmente preoccupante. Considerando il peggior scenario possibile, potrebbe essere un fattore importante di aggravamento di&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/existential-risks/\">minacce esistenziali</a> come&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/#reducing-great-power-conflict\">conflitti tra grandi potenze</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/nuclear-security/\">guerre nucleari</a> o&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/global-catastrophic-biological-risks/\">pandemie</a>. Ma siccome le potenziali conseguenze peggiori sembrano derivare da queste altre minacce, e questi altri rischi sembrano maggiori e pi\u00f9 trascurati, pensiamo che la maggior parte dei lettori possono avere un impatto maggiore lavorando direttamente a uno di questi altri rischi.&nbsp;</p><p>Pensiamo che la propria impronta carbonica personale sia molto meno importante del lavoro che si fa, e che alcuni modi per combattere il cambiamento climatico siano molto pi\u00f9 efficaci di altri. In particolare, si potrebbe usare la propria carriera per aiutare a sviluppare tecnologie o per spingere verso politiche in grado di ridurre le nostre attuali emissioni, oppure ricercare tecnologie in grado di rimuovere l'anidride carbonica dall\u2019atmosfera in futuro.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>La nostra opinione generale</strong></h3><p><strong>Raccomandazioni generali</strong></p><p>Ci farebbe piacere se ci fosse pi\u00f9 gente impegnata a risolvere questo problema, ma \u2014 considerata la nostra&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/key-ideas/#2-foundations-what-does-it-mean-to-make-a-difference\">visione generale del mondo</a> \u2014 a parit\u00e0 di condizioni ci farebbe ancora pi\u00f9 piacere se le persone si occupassero di uno dei nostri&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/#overall-list\">settori di problematiche ad alta priorit\u00e0</a>.</p><p><strong>Portata</strong></p><p>Pensiamo che, nell\u2019ambito del cambiamento climatico, impegnarci a ridurre materialmente la probabilit\u00e0 del peggiore scenario possibile porterebbe a un considerevole impatto positivo. Tuttavia, le probabilit\u00e0 che il cambiamento climatico porti&nbsp;<i>direttamente</i> all\u2019estinzione umana sembrano centinaia di volte inferiori rispetto a quelle di altri rischi, come quello di una pandemia catastrofica. Ne risulta che, se il cambiamento climatico avr\u00e0 effetti catastrofici e potenzialmente a lungo termine sulla civilt\u00e0 umana, questo avverr\u00e0 probabilmente attraverso l\u2019aggravamento di altri problemi, come per esempio i conflitti tra grandi potenze. Questo rischio&nbsp;<i>indiretto</i> porta la pericolosit\u00e0 del cambiamento climatico pi\u00f9 vicina a quella di altri rischi di estinzione, anche se sembrerebbe comunque che come causa di estinzione sia almeno 10 volte meno probabile rispetto a una guerra nucleare o a una pandemia. La nostra opinione \u00e8 che pi\u00f9 persone dovrebbero considerare seriamente di dedicarsi direttamente a quei problemi.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Trascuratezza</strong></p><p>Globalmente, il cambiamento climatico \u00e8 molto meno trascurato di altre&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/\">problematiche che riteniamo prioritarie</a>. La spesa attuale \u00e8 probabilmente di pi\u00f9 di&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/global-landscape-of-climate-finance-2021/\">640 miliardi di dollari</a> l\u2019anno. La lotta al cambiamento climatico ha anche ricevuto importanti finanziamenti per anni, e ci\u00f2 comporta che si \u00e8 gi\u00e0 fatto molto lavoro ad alto impatto. Sembra sensato, inoltre, che man mano che il cambiamento climatico diventer\u00e0 pi\u00f9 grave otterr\u00e0 ancora pi\u00f9 attenzione, permettendo cos\u00ec di agire maggiormente per arginare i suoi effetti peggiori. Tuttavia, probabilmente ci sono anche aree specifiche che non ricevono l\u2019attenzione che meritano.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Risolvibilit\u00e0</strong></p><p>Il cambiamento climatico sembra essere pi\u00f9 risolvibile di molti altri rischi di catastrofe globale, grazie al fatto che c\u2019\u00e8 un parametro chiaro per misurare il nostro successo (ovvero la quantit\u00e0 di gas serra emessi), e anche per la molta esperienza su cose che gi\u00e0 funzionano \u2014 per questo ci sono dati concreti su come procedere. Ci\u00f2 detto, affrontare il cambiamento climatico comporta un difficoltoso coordinamento globale, e questo lo rende pi\u00f9 difficile da risolvere.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Profondit\u00e0 del profilo</strong></p><p>Profondit\u00e0 media</p><p>Questo \u00e8 uno dei molti profili che abbiamo stilato per aiutare le persone a trovare i problemi pi\u00f9 urgenti che potrebbero risolvere tramite le loro carriere.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/most-pressing-problems/\">Clicca qui</a> per saperne di pi\u00f9 su come confrontiamo problemi differenti,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/problem-framework/\">qui&nbsp;</a>per vedere come cerchiamo di dar loro un punteggio numerico, e&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/\">qui&nbsp;</a>per vedere questo problema in proporzione agli altri considerati finora.</p><p>Se si hanno&nbsp;<i>feedback</i> a riguardo di questo articolo \u2013 sia che siano in merito a cose che abbiamo sbagliato, o frasi che potrebbero essere rese meglio in altro modo, o anche per dirci di aver apprezzato questo articolo \u2013 apprezzeremmo molto&nbsp;<strong>ricevere opinioni</strong> attraverso&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1uFWB5Cy_oZHUfjCwEYdx_tap9MljUBsZE1RRaiZ8mdg/edit\"><u>questo</u></a> modulo.

Per fare questa valutazione, si deve prima di tutto avere un\u2019idea della quantit\u00e0 di gas serra che verr\u00e0 emessa, e quanto questi faranno aumentare la temperatura.

Ma l'umanit\u00e0 ha ancora molte, molte pi\u00f9 probabilit\u00e0 di sopravvivere al cambiamento climatico che di non sopravvivere.</p><h2><strong>E le catastrofi globali che non sono l\u2019estinzione?</strong></h2><p>Anche se \u00e8 molto improbabile che il cambiamento climatico provochi l'estinzione dell'umanit\u00e0 (direttamente o indirettamente), potrebbe comunque causare una catastrofe globale di dimensioni tali da provocare la morte di una percentuale significativa della popolazione (ad esempio, pi\u00f9 del 10%)?</p><p>Non abbiamo indagato altrettanto a fondo questa possibilit\u00e0, ma le stesse ragioni per cui pensiamo che il cambiamento climatico non porter\u00e0 all'estinzione suggeriscono che non porter\u00e0 a un evento catastrofico di queste dimensioni. In breve: anche negli scenari di riscaldamento globale peggiori, molti esseri umani saranno ancora in grado di vivere sulla terra e di coltivare cibo.</p><p>Anche nell'1% degli scenari peggiori, riteniamo che sia estremamente improbabile che le morti premature dovute al cambiamento climatico superino il miliardo di persone, e pensiamo che questa perdita sarebbe probabilmente graduale (ad esempio nell'arco di un secolo) e dovuta a fattori come il calo della produttivit\u00e0 economica, piuttosto che a un collasso catastrofico improvviso. Si tratta comunque di un'immensa quantit\u00e0 di morti e sofferenze, e speriamo che i leader dei vari Paesi facciano in modo che non si verifichi.</p><p>Tuttavia, i&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/luisa-rodriguez-why-global-catastrophes-seem-unlikely-to-kill-us-all/\"><u>problemi graduali in generale sembrano pi\u00f9 facili da affrontare</u></a>, il che significa che il rischio che l'umanit\u00e0 non si riprender\u00e0 mai dagli effetti di un cambiamento climatico catastrofico (ma non a livello di estinzione immediata) sembra molto basso. Inferiore, ad esempio, a quello di una guerra nucleare globale.</p><p>Anche in questo caso, la minaccia indiretta del cambiamento climatico sembra maggiore. Ad esempio, \u00e8 possibile che le tensioni internazionali aggravate da fattori legati al cambiamento climatico portino a una guerra di questo tipo.</p><p>Nel complesso, riteniamo che il rischio di una catastrofe globale di livello inferiore all'estinzione, ma che uccida un miliardo o pi\u00f9 di persone, dovuta al cambiamento climatico, sia molto basso.</p><h2><strong>In quali altri modi il cambiamento climatico pu\u00f2 influenzare il futuro a lungo termine?</strong></h2><p>Anche se non sei d'accordo con la nostra enfasi sui rischi esistenziali (forse perch\u00e9 pensi che sia quasi scontato che sopravviveremo nei prossimi secoli), potresti comunque chiederti in quale altro modo i cambiamenti climatici potrebbero influenzare le generazioni future.</p><p>L\u2019anidride carbonica pu\u00f2 rimanere nell'atmosfera per&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2021/04/14/981333730/carbon-emissions-could-plummet-the-atmosphere-will-lag-behind\"><u>migliaia di anni</u></a>, il che significa che il riscaldamento pu\u00f2 continuare per centinaia di migliaia di anni dopo che avremo smesso di emetterla. Questo riscaldamento potrebbe continuare ad avere effetti negativi sulla nostra societ\u00e0.</p><p>Ad esempio, se nei prossimi 100 anni il livello dei mari si alzer\u00e0 di un metro, nei prossimi 10.000 anni potremo aspettarci un aumento di 10 metri del livello dei mari.</p><p>Ci\u00f2 significa che, se evitiamo catastrofi esistenziali e l'umanit\u00e0 continua ad abitare la Terra, le generazioni future potrebbero avere a che fare con gli effetti negativi del cambiamento climatico per molto tempo.</p><p>Inoltre, se il cambiamento climatico diventer\u00e0 molto grave, probabilmente avremo esaurito le nostre riserve di combustibili fossili. Questo non \u00e8 un effetto del cambiamento climatico in s\u00e9, ma piuttosto un effetto del fatto che non abbiamo fatto abbastanza per prevenirlo riducendo l\u2019uso di combustibili fossili. Oltre a causare il cambiamento climatico e tutto ci\u00f2 che ne consegue, consumare le nostre riserve di combustibili fossili significherebbe che se l\u2019umanit\u00e0 dovesse subire una (diversa) catastrofe globale che porti a un collasso della civilt\u00e0, potrebbe essere pi\u00f9 difficile ricostruirla.</p><p>Questo perch\u00e9 i combustibili fossili sono una delle forme di energia pi\u00f9 dense e pi\u00f9 accessibili. Immaginiamo, ad esempio, di trovarci in un inverno nucleare dopo una guerra nucleare globale e di dover rimettere tutto in funzione dopo aver perso la tecnologia e il know-how che abbiamo costruito negli ultimi 100 anni. In questo caso, sarebbe estremamente utile poter bruciare temporaneamente i combustibili fossili per ricostruire la societ\u00e0. Ma se li avremo gi\u00e0 bruciati tutti, non potremo farlo.

Tra queste c'\u00e8 il cambiamento climatico, ma anche altre che sembrano porre un rischio esistenziale pi\u00f9 concreto, come&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/global-catastrophic-biological-risks/\"><u>pandemie</u></a> o la&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/nuclear-security/\"><u>guerra nucleare</u></a>.</p><p>Se vuoi fare la differenza nella tua carriera e, come noi, ritieni che&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/existential-risks/\"><u>la riduzione delle minacce esistenziali sia una priorit\u00e0 assoluta</u></a>, su cosa dovresti concentrarti?</p><h3><strong>Motivi per lavorare sul cambiamento climatico</strong></h3><p>Anche se non si tratta di un rischio di estinzione, la discussione di cui sopra dimostra che il cambiamento climatico potrebbe comunque essere estremamente importante per il presente e per il futuro della vita sulla Terra. Quanto pi\u00f9 peggiora, tanto pi\u00f9 \u00e8 probabile che riduca la biodiversit\u00e0, costringa molte persone a migrare, rovini vite e destabilizzi la societ\u00e0. Anche solo questo \u00e8 un motivo per lavorarci.</p><p>Ma il fatto che qualcosa sia importante non \u00e8 necessariamente un motivo&nbsp;<i>sufficiente&nbsp;</i>per lavorarci. La nostra&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/problem-framework/\"><u>metodologia di confronto di problemi globali</u></a> suggerisce di considerare anche:</p><ul><li>Quanto \u00e8 risolvibile il cambiamento climatico?</li><li>Quanto \u00e8 trascurato il lavoro sul cambiamento climatico?</li><li>Come si pone rispetto ad altri problemi su cui potresti lavorare?</li></ul><p>Il cambiamento climatico sembra<strong> particolarmente risolvibile</strong> per un problema globale: c\u2019\u00e8 una chiara metrica di successo (la quantit\u00e0 di gas serra che stiamo emettendo), oltre a un\u2019ampia conoscenza di cosa funziona. Ci sono dati chiari su come fare progressi.</p><p>Ci sono anche&nbsp;<strong>tante opportunit\u00e0&nbsp;</strong>di lavorare sul cambiamento climatico.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pewresearch.org/global/2020/09/09/despite-pandemic-many-europeans-still-see-climate-change-as-greatest-threat-to-their-countries/\"><u>Cittadini europei e americani concordano sul fatto che il cambiamento climatico \u00e8 uno dei problemi pi\u00f9 importanti di questo secolo</u></a>, e ci sono quindi molte opportunit\u00e0 di lavorare su questo tema in ambito statale, nel privato e nel mondo accademico.</p><p>Ci\u00f2 significa che se si riesce a raggiungere una posizione di influenza, si possono sfruttare molte risorse.</p><p>Poich\u00e9 molte persone pensano che il cambiamento climatico \u00e8 importante, \u00e8 probabile che i modi pi\u00f9 semplici per fare la differenza siano gi\u00e0 stati adottati (maggiori dettagli nella prossima sezione).</p><p>Tuttavia, alcuni importanti lavori sul cambiamento climatico sembrano essere&nbsp;<strong>relativamente trascurati</strong>. Non c'\u00e8 molta ricerca su come il cambiamento climatico interagisca con altri potenziali rischi catastrofici. Anche il lavoro sulle tecnologie per l'energia pulita sembra&nbsp;<a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/research/fp-climate-change\"><u>trascurato rispetto alla sua importanza</u></a>, anche se riceve comunque molte risorse.</p><p>Il tuo lavoro potrebbe anche avere<strong> effetti secondari positivi</strong>. Per esempio, ridurre la nostra dipendenza dai combustibili fossili potrebbe anche ridurre l'inquinamento atmosferico, che&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/air-pollution\"><u>causa milioni di morti ogni anno</u></a>. Lavorare sui cambiamenti climatici estremi potrebbe indirettamente contribuire a promuovere valori positivi,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/key-ideas/#longtermism\"><u>come l'attenzione per le generazioni future</u></a>, ed \u00e8 possibile che trovare modi efficaci per mitigare i cambiamenti climatici possa servire da modello per sforzi futuri per affrontare minacce globali.</p><h3><strong>Motivi per non lavorare sul cambiamento climatico</strong></h3><p><strong>Non \u00e8 trascurato quanto altri problemi</strong></p><p>Il cambiamento climatico riceve molta attenzione e finanziamenti. In particolare, riceve molta pi\u00f9 attenzione di molti&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/\"><u>altri problemi globali</u></a> urgenti.</p><p>Il bilancio federale degli Stati Uniti ha incluso circa&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/briefing-room/2022/04/04/quantifying-risks-to-the-federal-budget-from-climate-change/\"><u>23 miliardi di dollari di spesa per il cambiamento climatico nell'anno fiscale 2021</u></a>. Il Regno Unito ha speso circa&nbsp;<a href=\"https://obr.uk/box/climate-related-measures-in-the-budget-and-spending-review/\"><u>4 miliardi di sterline per l'anno fiscale 2021-22</u></a>. E diverse centinaia di milioni di dollari vengono&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/climate-change/#fn-25\"><u>erogati ogni anno da fondazioni private</u></a>. La spesa filantropica per il cambiamento climatico \u00e8 di&nbsp;<a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/stories/changing-landscape\"><u>5-10 miliardi di dollari all'anno</u></a>. Oltre a ci\u00f2, molte aziende e universit\u00e0 di tutto il mondo lavorano alla ricerca sul cambiamento climatico o su tecnologie volte a ridurre le emissioni. La&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/global-landscape-of-climate-finance-2021/\"><u>Climate Policy Initiative</u></a> ha calcolato oltre 600 miliardi di dollari di spesa legata al clima nel 2020.</p><p>In confronto, la biosicurezza in generale riceve circa 3 miliardi di dollari all'anno, la prevenzione di pandemie catastrofiche in particolare riceve&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/global-catastrophic-biological-risks/#the-imperfectly-allocated-portfolio\"><u>circa 1 miliardo di dollari</u></a> e la riduzione dei rischi derivanti dall'intelligenza artificiale riceve&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/climate-change/#fn-26\"><u>tra i 10 e i 50 milioni di dollari</u></a>.</p><p>Se un problema \u00e8 meno trascurato, sar\u00e0 pi\u00f9 difficile per una persona in pi\u00f9<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/problem-framework/#how-to-assess-how-neglected-a-problem-is\"><u> fare la differenza lavorandoci</u></a>.</p><p><strong>Altre minacce esistenziali sembrano molto pi\u00f9 grandi</strong></p><p>Un\u2019altra considerazione \u00e8 che, per quanto il cambiamento climatico sia un problema serio, sembrano esserci altri rischi che pongono minacce maggiori alla prosperit\u00e0 a lungo termine dell'umanit\u00e0.</p><p>Gli esperti che studiano i rischi di estinzione umana di solito ritengono che&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/toby-ord-the-precipice-existential-risk-future-humanity/\"><u>la guerra nucleare, le guerre tra grandi potenze e alcuni pericolosi progressi nel campo dell\u2019intelligenza artificiale o nelle biotecnologie abbiano una probabilit\u00e0 maggiore di causare l'estinzione umana</u></a> rispetto al cambiamento climatico.</p><p>Questo ci sembra pi\u00f9 o meno corretto.</p><p>Si potrebbe pensare che, per le ragioni discusse&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Mzfb0JjZLAyVh6LaH7vFXwwtrd646_w81jWFPynJ0Mw/edit#heading=h.pvzs4zwnafjo\"><u>sopra</u></a>, il cambiamento climatico sia un fattore talmente importante nel contribuire ad altri rischi da meritare una priorit\u00e0. Non sarebbe un'opinione irragionevole.</p><p>Ma queste altre minacce, spesso pi\u00f9 dirette, spesso agiscono&nbsp;<i>anche&nbsp;</i>come fattori contribuenti. Per esempio, le pandemie possono aumentare le tensioni geopolitiche e quindi i rischi di conflitto. E alcune di esse, in particolare le pandemie ingegnerizzate e i rischi derivanti da un\u2019IA non allineata, sembrano costituire esse stesse una minaccia diretta di estinzione.</p><p>Quindi,&nbsp;<i>se&nbsp;</i>sei d'accordo sul fatto che siamo di fronte a minacce esistenziali dirette e considerevoli, per ritenere che il cambiamento climatico sia pi\u00f9 importante dovresti pensare che il cambiamento climatico sia un fattore di rischio molto maggiore di altri, cos\u00ec grande da superare la differenza di rischio diretto. Secondo noi probabilmente non \u00e8 cos\u00ec.</p><p>Detto questo, ci sono altri fattori che determinano in quale ambito lavorare, in particolare \u00e8 importante considerare la propria&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/key-ideas/#6-personal-fit-what-are-you-good-at\"><u>attitudine personale</u></a> a lavorare in un settore (e abbiamo parlato con diverse persone che sono pi\u00f9 adatte a lavorare sul cambiamento climatico piuttosto che su qualsiasi altro tema). Tuttavia, secondo la nostra esperienza, sembra che molte persone sottovalutino la loro capacit\u00e0 di lavorare, con un po' di formazione, su temi con cui hanno meno familiarit\u00e0. Le persone sembrano anche sottovalutare la gamma di posizioni, e quindi i diversi tipi di lavoro in cui potrebbero eccellere, in diverse aree.</p><p>Di conseguenza, pur concordando sul fatto che \u00e8 fondamentale lavorare per ridurre le minacce esistenziali per l'umanit\u00e0, e concordando sul fatto che i cambiamenti climatici aumentano tali minacce, di solito consigliamo alle persone interessate a salvaguardare il futuro dell'umanit\u00e0 di concentrarsi su&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/\"><u>minacce esistenziali pi\u00f9 grandi e pi\u00f9 dirette</u></a>, se ne hanno la possibilit\u00e0.</p><p>Ma dato che molte persone si occuperanno di cambiamenti climatici nel corso della loro carriera (e in termini assoluti speriamo che lo facciano sempre pi\u00f9 persone, pur sperando anche che molti dei nostri lettori diano la priorit\u00e0 a rischi pi\u00f9 diretti), vorremmo dire due parole su come farlo nel modo pi\u00f9 efficace possibile.</p><h2><strong>Quali sono i modi migliori di lavorare per risolvere il cambiamento climatico?</strong></h2><p>Molti approcci tipici per lavorare sul cambiamento climatico e su altri problemi ambientali probabilmente non sono poi cos\u00ec utili.</p><p>Per esempio, il maggiore uso di terreno nell'agricoltura biologica significa che potrebbe far&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20221021232957/https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-50129353\"><u>aumentare le emissioni rispetto all'agricoltura normale</u></a>.

Questo perch\u00e9 all'innovatore non costa molto: pu\u00f2 trarre vantaggio dalla vendita delle sue invenzioni.</p><p>Ci\u00f2 significa che la tecnologia a basse o nulle emissioni \u00e8 probabilmente una delle pi\u00f9 grandi possibilit\u00e0 esistenti.</p><p>Infine,&nbsp;<strong>la spesa per il cambiamento climatico \u00e8 enorme, ma potrebbe trascurare aspetti fondamentali.</strong></p><p>Abbiamo sostenuto in precedenza che il cambiamento climatico sembra meno trascurato rispetto ad altre aree, con un investimento di&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.climatepolicyinitiative.org/publication/global-landscape-of-climate-finance-2021/\"><u>640 miliardi di dollari all'anno</u></a>.</p><p>Ci\u00f2 significa che, se riesci a individuare delle sottoaree importanti ma trascurate nell'ambito del cambiamento climatico, portare maggiori risorse in queste aree o un miglioramento nella prioritizzazione delle risorse esistenti potrebbe avere un impatto enorme. Spostamenti piccoli in proporzione possono spostare grandi quantit\u00e0 di denaro.</p><h3><strong>Ridurre le emissioni nette di gas serra, soprattutto attraverso l'innovazione tecnologica</strong></h3><p>Riteniamo che uno dei modi pi\u00f9 promettenti per ridurre le emissioni di gas serra sia quello di lavorare alla ricerca e allo sviluppo di fonti di energia sostenibili.</p><p>L'energia sostenibile ha una storia di risultati incredibili, pu\u00f2 aiutare a risolvere problemi in diversi Paesi, e non \u00e8 necessario che altre persone si convincano ad agire. Ad esempio, chiedere alle persone di non guidare vuol dire chiedere loro di fare un sacrificio personale, mentre lo sviluppo di automobili a emissioni zero risolve il problema senza bisogno di fare questa scelta.</p><p>L'energia rinnovabile \u00e8 oggi spesso pi\u00f9 economica dei combustibili fossili: questo potrebbe essere un motivo fondamentale per cui le emissioni stanno diminuendo in Europa e in Nord America.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bjRus8zN5RTE2AGGT/cik5lh5rx8rhzi0nxjrt\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bjRus8zN5RTE2AGGT/kqgqggw0f3qdqv3dmrrq 110w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bjRus8zN5RTE2AGGT/dxxfahllg1yn8jfthhlb 220w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bjRus8zN5RTE2AGGT/xk7qchs22ctdhgufgnwp 330w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bjRus8zN5RTE2AGGT/hqkmlpi65t9f8sam8nfa 440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bjRus8zN5RTE2AGGT/exiqbopmqcmgoa4hjscm 550w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bjRus8zN5RTE2AGGT/xnty4hkuzz5ois1k2xl5 660w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bjRus8zN5RTE2AGGT/ros8hovubm3ubs1tg11l 770w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bjRus8zN5RTE2AGGT/qwqae1mmc255wrecsyoz 880w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bjRus8zN5RTE2AGGT/gmlf6jvdmaqfbpab7eka 990w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bjRus8zN5RTE2AGGT/ab31o8bf2c08zaschvjo 1036w\"></p><p><i>Il costo delle fonti di energia rinnovabili come il solare e l\u2019eolico \u00e8 crollato.&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/cheap-renewables-growth\"><i>Our World In Data</i></a><i>.</i></p><p>Per massimizzare il tuo impatto, concentrati su tecnologie meno conosciute.

L'altra forma primaria di geoingegneria \u00e8 la&nbsp;<i>geoingegneria solare</i> (riflettere deliberatamente pi\u00f9 luce solare dalla Terra per raffreddare il pianeta). La geoingegneria solare presenta di per s\u00e9 possibili rischi per l'umanit\u00e0, data la portata senza precedenti dell'intervento e il fatto che, una volta in uso,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0016328717301131\"><u>la geoingegneria solare non pu\u00f2 essere lasciata a s\u00e9 stessa senza causare effetti disastrosi</u></a>. Questi rischi potrebbero essere maggiori di quelli derivanti dal cambiamento climatico stesso, quindi riteniamo potenzialmente dannoso svolgere un lavoro che potrebbe far progredire la geoingegneria solare.</p><p>La ricerca sulla geoingegneria di tutti i tipi viene svolta principalmente in ambito accademico. Il&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.oxfordmartin.ox.ac.uk/geoengineering/\"><u>Programma di Geoingegneria dell'Universit\u00e0 di Oxford</u></a> conduce ricerche sugli aspetti sociali, etici e tecnici della geoingegneria.</p><h3><strong>Ricerca su rischi estremi del cambiamento climatico</strong></h3><p>Non pensiamo sia probabile che il cambiamento climatico causer\u00e0 da solo una catastrofe tale da far collassare la societ\u00e0, o da uccidere gran parte (&gt;10%) della popolazione. Ma, come abbiamo sostenuto, gli effetti indiretti del cambiamento climatico potrebbero contribuire ad aumentare le minacce esistenziali.</p><p>Ma, come abbiamo visto in precedenza, \u00e8 difficile dire con esattezza quanto contribuisca e come mitigare al meglio questi effetti.

Un\u2019unit\u00e0 di risorse potrebbe essere un anno di lavoro, o un dollaro di donazioni, o qualche altro metro di misura.&nbsp;</p><p>Questo non \u00e8 facile da stimare di per s\u00e9, perci\u00f2 dobbiamo dividerlo in parti che possiamo stimare individualmente.&nbsp;</p><p>Nel nostro&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/most-pressing-problems/\">articolo introduttivo</a>, abbiamo fornito una suddivisione approssimativa di alcuni fattori qualitativi. Ecco una versione pi\u00f9 precisa e quantitativa della stessa suddivisione:</p><ul><li><strong>Portata</strong><ul><li>Bene ottenuto / % risolta di un problema</li></ul></li><li><strong>Risolvibilit\u00e0</strong><ul><li>% risolta di un problema / % di aumento delle risorse impiegate</li></ul></li><li><strong>Trascuratezza</strong><ul><li>% di aumento delle risorse impiegate / persona o dollaro in pi\u00f9</li></ul></li></ul><p>Una buona ragione per dare queste definizioni \u00e8 che se le moltiplichiamo tutte e tre tra loro otteniamo nuovamente \u201cbene ottenuto\u201d / \u201cpersona o dollaro in pi\u00f9\u201d assegnati al problema:</p><ul><li><strong>Portata:&nbsp;</strong><ul><li>Bene ottenuto /<s> % risolta di un problema</s></li></ul></li><li><strong>Risolvibilit\u00e0</strong><ul><li><s>% risolta di un problema</s> / <s>% di aumento delle risorse impiegate</s></li></ul></li><li><strong>Trascuratezza</strong><ul><li><s>% di aumento delle risorse impiegate</s> / persona o dollaro in pi\u00f9</li></ul></li></ul><p>Quindi, ora abbiamo suddiviso il concetto di \u201cbene ottenuto per dollaro\u201d in tre componenti, ognuna con una definizione quantitativa.&nbsp;</p><p>Cosa sono queste componenti, tradotte in parole semplici?&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Portata</strong> \u2013 quanto sarebbe un bene risolvere il problema?</li><li><strong>Risolvibilit\u00e0</strong> \u2013 se raddoppiassimo le risorse impiegate a risolvere questo problema, quale percentuale del problema ci aspetteremmo di risolvere?</li><li><strong>Trascuratezza</strong> \u2013 quante risorse si stanno gi\u00e0 impiegando per risolvere questo problema?</li></ul><p>Infine, se stai cercando di capire su quali problemi dovresti lavorare&nbsp;<i>tu&nbsp;</i>in particolare, puoi assegnare dei punti bonus a quei problemi che meglio ti si adattano, come spiegheremo pi\u00f9 approfonditamente.</p><p>Pi\u00f9 avanti discuteremo di come valutare ciascun punto, ma prima di ci\u00f2 abbiamo qualche altra osservazione su come impostare l\u2019analisi.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Definire un problema con attenzione</strong></h2><p>Prima di procedere con una tua valutazione, assicurati di avere una descrizione chiara della portata dei problemi che hai deciso di confrontare. Questo ti aiuter\u00e0 a essere coerente nell\u2019assegnare un punteggio a ciascun fattore. Per esempio, se vogliamo valutare la \u201csalute a livello globale\u201d, dobbiamo chiarire:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Quali malattie sono incluse (per esempio tubercolosi, HIV, malaria, ecc.)</li><li>Quali paesi stiamo considerando (per esempio solo i pi\u00f9 poveri, o anche quelli a medio reddito?)</li></ul><p>Una sfida insita in qualsiasi schema di questo tipo \u00e8 rappresentata dal fatto che problemi scelti attentamente e pi\u00f9 \u201cristretti\u201d tendono ad avere un miglior punteggio di quelli definiti in maniera vaga. Per esempio, \u201ccombattere la malaria\u201d sembrer\u00e0 pi\u00f9 pressante della \u201csalute a livello globale\u201d, perch\u00e9 la malaria \u00e8 un problema sanitario con prospettive di lavoro promettenti. Allo stesso modo, migliorare le condizioni sanitarie in Kenya sembrer\u00e0 pi\u00f9 degno di nota rispetto a migliorare le condizioni di salute in Costa Rica. Non c\u2019\u00e8 niente di sbagliato in questi risultati \u2013ma potrebbero dare impressioni sbagliate quando si confronta un problema definito in modo vago con uno definito in modo pi\u00f9 stringente. Se qualcuno ne avesse motivo, potrebbe far sembrare un problema pi\u00f9 o meno urgente definendolo in maniere differenti \u2013 e questo \u00e8 qualcosa che dobbiamo considerare quando interpretiamo questi punteggi.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Creare una scala (logaritmica)</strong></h2><p>Se stai cercando di confrontare settori differenti utilizzando questi punteggi, noterai che variano immensamente. Per esempio, mentre annualmente si spendono circa&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/health-in-poor-countries/\">300 miliardi di dollari per la salute a livello globale</a>, si spendono meno di&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/factory-farming/\">100 milioni di dollari per affrontare i problemi dell\u2019allevamento intensivo</a>. Ne consegue che l\u2019allevamento intensivo \u00e8 1,000 volte pi\u00f9 trascurato della salute a livello globale.&nbsp;</p><p>Questo significa che \u00e8 pi\u00f9 conveniente utilizzare una \u201cscala logaritmica\u201d quando si assegna un punteggio a ciascun componente. Noi lo facciamo in questa maniera: ogni due punti assegnati a un problema significano che \u00e8 10 volte pi\u00f9 efficace. Per esempio, se assegniamo a un problema un punteggio di trascuratezza pari a 4 e a un altro un punteggio pari a 6, allora significa che il secondo problema \u00e8 10 volte pi\u00f9 trascurato del primo.&nbsp;</p><p>\u00c8 come la&nbsp;<a href=\"https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scala_Richter\">scala Richter</a> utilizzata per misurare i terremoti.

Idealmente, si dovrebbero anche cogliere le ricadute benefiche che progressi in un dato problema avrebbero su altri problemi.

Questo accade perch\u00e9 le persone si occupano prima delle migliori possibilit\u00e0 di ottenere un impatto, quindi man mano che pi\u00f9 risorse vengono investite diventa sempre pi\u00f9 difficile fare una differenza. Pertanto \u00e8 spesso meglio concentrarsi su problemi che sono stati trascurati dagli altri.&nbsp;</p><p>Per esempio, la vaccinazione di massa dei bambini \u00e8 un intervento estremamente efficace per migliorare la salute a livello globale, ma \u00e8 gi\u00e0 fortemente sostenuta dai governi e da molte associazioni importanti, tra cui la&nbsp;<i>Gates Foundation</i>. Questo rende pi\u00f9 improbabile che sia una delle migliori opportunit\u00e0 per i donatori futuri.&nbsp;</p><p>Esplorare nuovi problemi \u00e8 utile anche perch\u00e9 ci permette di capire quali problemi sono effettivamente pi\u00f9 urgenti. Vale a dire, c\u2019\u00e8 un \u201cvalore d\u2019informazione\u201d aggiuntivo nel cercare cose nuove. Se nessuno ha mai lavorato su un problema prima d\u2019ora, allora potrebbe facilmente rivelarsi pi\u00f9 risolvibile di quanto si creda al momento.&nbsp;</p><p>Ci sono&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2015/11/stop-talking-about-declining-returns-in-small-organisations/\">alcuni meccanismi grazie ai quali alcuni settori di problematiche possono vedere rendimenti crescenti</a> invece che decrescenti. Tuttavia, crediamo che ci siano&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/cost-effectiveness-of-research-overview/\">buone argomentazioni teoriche ed empiriche&nbsp;</a>per sostenere che i rendimenti decrescenti siano la norma e che decrescano pi\u00f9 probabilmente in maniera logaritmica. I rendimenti crescenti potrebbero verificarsi su scale molto piccole all\u2019interno di settori di problematiche, ma non siano certi nemmeno di questo a causa del valore dei benefici d\u2019informazione di cui abbiamo precedentemente discusso (i rendimenti crescenti sono probabilmente pi\u00f9 comuni all\u2019interno di organizzazioni, piuttosto che di settori di problematiche).</p><p>Bisogna anche tenere in considerazione che la trascuratezza \u00e8 un buon indicatore solo se il settore \u00e8 trascurato dagli altri&nbsp;<i>per cattive ragioni</i>. Ad ogni modo, riteniamo che i meccanismi della societ\u00e0 per fare del bene siano tutt\u2019altro che efficaci, quindi a parit\u00e0 di tutto il resto la trascuratezza \u00e8 un buon segno. Un caso particolarmente importante per cui un problema pu\u00f2 essere trascurato per cattive ragioni \u00e8 quando le altre persone, semplicemente, non gli danno importanza.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2014/01/neglectedness-and-impact/\">Questo articolo</a> sostiene che se dai a un qualcosa un\u2019importanza X volte maggiore di quanto gliene darebbe la persona media, dovresti aspettarti di essere in grado, lavorando su quel settore, di ottenere un impatto X volte maggiore (in base alle tue convinzioni e predisposizioni). Per esempio, pensiamo che gli interessi delle generazioni future siano valutati drammaticamente troppo poco dalla societ\u00e0, quindi lavorando su ci\u00f2 che pu\u00f2 aiutare le generazioni future possiamo avere molto pi\u00f9 impatto.</p><h3><strong>Come valutarla</strong></h3><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#f5f5f5;border-style:solid;padding:8pt 15pt 8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>Punteggio di affollamento</strong>:</p></td><td style=\"background-color:#f5f5f5;border-style:solid;padding:8pt 15pt 8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>Quanto si spende direttamente sul problema per anno</strong>?&nbsp;</p></td><td style=\"background-color:#f5f5f5;border-style:solid;padding:8pt 15pt 8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>Quante persone lavorano a tempo pieno sul problema</strong>?</p></td><td style=\"background-color:#f5f5f5;border-style:solid;padding:8pt 15pt 8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>Qual \u00e8 il numero di persone che sostengono attivamente l\u2019importanza di lavorare sul problema</strong>?&nbsp;</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\">12</td><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\">100.000 $ o meno</td><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\">1 o meno</td><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\">1.000 o meno</td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:#f5f5f5;border-style:solid;padding:8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\">10</td><td style=\"background-color:#f5f5f5;border-style:solid;padding:8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\">1 milione di dollari</td><td style=\"background-color:#f5f5f5;border-style:solid;padding:8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\">10</td><td style=\"background-color:#f5f5f5;border-style:solid;padding:8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\">10.000</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\">8</td><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\">10 milioni di dollari</td><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\">100</td><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\">100.000</td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:#f5f5f5;border-style:solid;padding:8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\">6</td><td style=\"background-color:#f5f5f5;border-style:solid;padding:8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\">100 milioni di dollari</td><td style=\"background-color:#f5f5f5;border-style:solid;padding:8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\">1.000</td><td style=\"background-color:#f5f5f5;border-style:solid;padding:8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\">1 milione</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\">4</td><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\">1 miliardo di dollari</td><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\">10.000</td><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\">10 milioni</td></tr><tr><td style=\"background-color:#f5f5f5;border-style:solid;padding:8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\">2</td><td style=\"background-color:#f5f5f5;border-style:solid;padding:8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\">10 miliardi di dollari</td><td style=\"background-color:#f5f5f5;border-style:solid;padding:8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\">100.000</td><td style=\"background-color:#f5f5f5;border-style:solid;padding:8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\">100 milioni</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\">0</td><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\">100 miliardi di dollari</td><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\">1 milione</td><td style=\"border-style:solid;padding:8pt 11pt;vertical-align:top\">1 miliardo (vale a dire: tutti)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3><strong>Un problema \u2013 sforzo diretto vs. indiretto e sforzo futuro</strong></h3><p>Spesso delle risorse dedicate alla risoluzione di un problema provengono in modo non intenzionale da gruppi con interessi personali o che lavorano su una problematica adiacente.

Questi sforzi indiretti possono essere cospicui. Per esempio, non molti soldi sono spesi direttamente sulla ricerca per prevenire le cause dell\u2019invecchiamento, ma molti settori della ricerca biomedica stanno contribuendovi rispondendo a domande correlate o sviluppando metodiche migliori. Anche se questo lavoro non \u00e8 specificatamente ben indirizzato alla riduzione dei processi d\u2019invecchiamento, si spende molto di pi\u00f9 sulla ricerca biomedica in generale che sulla ricerca contro l\u2019invecchiamento in particolare. Probabilmente la maggior parte del progresso sulla prevenzione dell\u2019invecchiamento proviene da questi sforzi indiretti.</p><p>Gli sforzi indiretti sono difficili da misurare, e ancor pi\u00f9 difficili da adeguare in base all\u2019utilit\u00e0 che hanno nel risolvere il problema in questione.&nbsp;</p><p>Per questa ragione, di solito diamo un punteggio solo allo \u201csforzo diretto\u201d su un problema.

Se si utilizzano definizioni diverse del problema per ciascuna valutazione si otterranno risultati inesatti.&nbsp;</p><p>Se ci sono diversi tipi di risorse assegnate a un problema, si deve utilizzare la colonna col punteggio pi\u00f9 basso (ovvero quella in cui \u00e8 presente la maggior parte delle risorse totali dedicate). Per esempio, se per un problema sono investiti 10 miliardi di dollari l\u2019anno e ci lavorano 1000 persone a tempo pieno, allora la parte prevalente sar\u00e0 quella del denaro, quindi il punteggio sar\u00e0 4, e non 8.&nbsp;</p><p>Come ultima considerazione, siamo cauti nell\u2019assegnare punteggi molto elevati alla trascuratezza. Persino i problemi meno conosciuti di solito attraggono l\u2019attenzione di qualche gruppo nel mondo, e potremmo semplicemente non esserne a conoscenza. Quindi, a meno che non si sia gi\u00e0 svolta una ricerca esaustiva che dimostri il contrario, assumeremo di base che almeno 1 milione di dollari stia venendo destinato al problema.</p><h2><strong>Come valutare la risolvibilit\u00e0 di un problema</strong></h2><h3><strong>Definizione</strong></h3><p>Se si raddoppiasse lo sforzo diretto su questo problema, quale percentuale del problema rimanente ci si aspetterebbe di risolvere?</p><h3><strong>Perch\u00e9 \u00e8 importante?</strong></h3><p>Anche se un problema \u00e8 enormemente importante e fortemente trascurato, questo non significa che sia una causa importante sulla quale concentrarci.

Il termine viene solitamente utilizzato per sottolineare che, quando si prendono delle decisioni, si dovrebbe prendere in considerazione solo l'impatto effettivamente generato dalla propria scelta, piuttosto che contare l'impatto di sforzi gi\u00e0 esistenti. Ad esempio, unirsi a un grande movimento con un grande impatto non \u00e8 intrinsecamente meglio che unirsi a un piccolo movimento, se il proprio impatto \u00e8 maggiore come parte del movimento pi\u00f9 piccolo.</p><h2>Descrizione</h2><p>Amiamo unirci a grandi movimenti importanti: cosa c'\u00e8 di pi\u00f9 entusiasmante di far parte di qualcosa che ha cambiato il mondo? Ma, se ti stai chiedendo come puoi fare pi\u00f9 bene possibile, basarti sull'impatto di un progetto nel suo complesso pu\u00f2 essere profondamente sbagliato.</p><p>L\u2019<strong>impatto marginale</strong> dei tuoi sforzi (che tu stia investendo tempo, denaro o altro) \u00e8 l\u2019impatto incrementale aggiuntivo che essi ottengono. Il concetto di impatto marginale deriva dall\u2019idea di&nbsp;<a href=\"https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rendimenti_marginali\"><u>rendimento marginale</u></a> in economia: se siete un produttore di tostapane che sta valutando se produrre un altro tostapane da vendere, per esempio, la domanda che dovete porvi non \u00e8 se il&nbsp;<i>business</i> dei tostapane sia redditizio in generale, ma piuttosto quanto profitto farete con il prossimo tostapane. \u00c8 possibile che la vendita dei tostapane sia un\u2019attivit\u00e0 complessivamente redditizia, ma che il mercato sia gi\u00e0 saturo di prodotti venduti in precedenza e non riusciate a venderne un altro. In questo caso, i vostri profitti totali dalla vendita dei tostapane potrebbero rimanere elevati anche se ne producete un altro, ma i vostri profitti marginali (ricavi meno spese per questa unit\u00e0 aggiuntiva) saranno negativi. Quindi, innanzitutto produrlo sarebbe una cattiva idea: perdereste denaro.</p><p>Una logica simile si applica quando cerchiamo di ottenere altri tipi di impatto oltre a quello di guadagnare pi\u00f9 soldi, compreso l\u2019aiutare gli altri. Quando decidiamo di dedicare il nostro tempo, denaro, conoscenze o opportunit\u00e0 a qualcosa, dobbiamo valutare l\u2019impatto che avr\u00e0 questo sforzo aggiuntivo. Se non lo facciamo, rischiamo di commettere un errore che rispecchia la&nbsp;<a href=\"https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costo_irrecuperabile\"><u>fallacia dei costi irrecuperabili</u></a> (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunk_cost\"><u>sunk cost</u></a>), ovvero continuare a sprecare denaro nel tentativo di porre rimedio a un pessimo investimento.</p><p>Ma questa considerazione ha davvero importanza nella vita reale? Se voglio fare una donazione a un ente di beneficenza, per esempio, il suo impatto attuale non sarebbe un buon indicatore dell\u2019impatto delle donazioni future? Non necessariamente.</p><p>Ogni anno,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wikimediafoundation.org/about/annualreport/2020-annual-report/donors/\"><u>milioni di persone</u></a> scelgono di fare una donazione a Wikipedia. Questo ha molto senso: Wikipedia \u00e8 usata da pi\u00f9 di un miliardo di persone ogni mese, fornisce accesso a materiali educativi, risponde a domande pratiche e combatte la disinformazione. Allo stesso tempo, il mantenimento dell\u2019infrastruttura tecnica costa circa&nbsp;<a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Wikimedia_Foundation_Medium-term_plan_2019/Annual_Plan_2021-2022\"><u>36 milioni di dollari l\u2019anno</u></a>. Ci\u00f2 significa che Wikipedia fornisce questo valore a un costo inferiore a un centesimo di dollaro al mese per utente: sarebbe un ottimo esempio di donazione mirata all\u2019impatto! Tuttavia, mentre Wikipedia ha bisogno di circa 36 milioni di dollari all\u2019anno per coprire i costi, negli ultimi anni&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Fundraising_statistics\"><u>ha raccolto ben pi\u00f9 di 100 milioni di dollari all\u2019anno</u></a>. Ma soprattutto, la maggior parte di queste entrate aggiuntive viene investita in iniziative che hanno&nbsp;<a href=\"https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Grants:APG/FDC_portal/Annual_report_on_the_Funds_Dissemination_Committee_process_2012-2013#The_WMF_Executive_Director.E2.80.99s_Reflections_on_the_FDC_Process\"><u>costi elevati e risultati dubbi</u></a>, secondo quanto dichiarato da un&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dailydot.com/business/sue-gardner-log-rolling-corruption-wikimedia-chapters/\"><u>ex direttore esecutivo</u></a>.

Questo \u00e8 un esempio in cui l\u2019impatto totale (o anche il rapporto costo-efficacia totale) \u00e8 un\u2019approssimazione piuttosto scadente dell\u2019impatto marginale delle donazioni aggiuntive. I primi milioni di dollari che Wikipedia riceve sono incredibilmente preziosi e importanti, ma sono gi\u00e0 un affare fatto: puoi ottenere solo l\u2019impatto marginale del 100 milionesimo dollaro o pi\u00f9.</p><p>Questo tipo di effetti non \u00e8 tipico solamente di Wikipedia. La maggior parte delle organizzazioni sperimenta&nbsp;<a href=\"http://legge_dei_rendimenti_decrescenti\"><u>rendimenti decrescenti</u></a> (per essere pi\u00f9 precisi rendimenti marginali decrescenti). Questo accade quando i primi dollari spesi valgono molto di pi\u00f9 di investimenti aggiuntivi. Ma i rendimenti marginali possono anche essere pi\u00f9 alti di quelli medi, ad esempio se un\u2019organizzazione ha&nbsp;<a href=\"https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costo_fisso\"><u>costi fissi</u></a> significativi o&nbsp;<a href=\"https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economie_di_scala\"><u>economie di scala</u></a>. In sostanza, per scegliere le nostre prossime azioni, dobbiamo guardare all\u2019impatto marginale dei nostri sforzi invece che all\u2019impatto totale o medio dell\u2019organizzazione, sia esso superiore o inferiore.</p><p>Questa considerazione \u00e8 importante quando si prendono decisioni sulla carriera cos\u00ec come quando si decide a chi fare una donazione. L\u2019impatto marginale di un dipendente aggiuntivo in un\u2019organizzazione pu\u00f2 essere completamente diverso dall\u2019impatto medio di un dipendente dell\u2019azienda. Il vostro impatto marginale in un\u2019organizzazione dipende da molti dettagli specifici, ma ci sono alcune considerazioni generali che indicano come l\u2019idea di impatto marginale potrebbe influenzare le vostre scelte di carriera:</p><ul><li>Sebbene a prima vista possa sembrare scontato che entrare a far parte di organizzazioni di maggior successo e impatto sia sempre meglio, alcune delle aspettative aggiuntive del lavorare in una grande organizzazione sono mitigate dall\u2019avere meno influenza sull\u2019organizzazione nel suo complesso, rendendo cos\u00ec poco chiaro quale sarebbe il vostro impatto marginale.</li><li>Riteniamo che unirsi a organizzazioni di incredibile successo e impatto sia di solito una buona idea, ma questo perch\u00e9 spesso offrono buone opportunit\u00e0 di impatto individuale (oltre a un ottimo&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.probablygood.org/post/career-capital\"><u>capitale di carriera</u></a>) e il loro impatto totale, se cos\u00ec non fosse, non dovrebbe influenzarvi.</li><li>Ci\u00f2 aumenta di molto l'importanza dell\u2019<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/personal-fit/\"><u>attitudine personale</u></a> e dell\u2019agire in base a opportunit\u00e0 uniche che tu noti e che ad altri potrebbero sfuggire. Mentre le opportunit\u00e0 ovvie, note a tutti, di solito hanno un impatto totale maggiore, quelle che puoi sfruttare in modo unico spesso hanno un grande impatto marginale.</li></ul><p><br>In conclusione, l'impatto marginale \u00e8 un concetto importante che pu\u00f2 aiutarci a evitare le insidie di euristiche pi\u00f9 semplici su dove investire il nostro tempo, il nostro denaro o persino la nostra carriera. Pensare all\u2019impatto marginale delle nostre azioni pu\u00f2 aiutarci sia a evitare casi in cui gli investimenti passati erano promettenti, ma ora non pi\u00f9 cos\u00ec utili, sia a identificare opportunit\u00e0 estremamente promettenti che potrebbero sfuggirci se considerassimo il solo impatto totale.</p><h2>Risorse aggiuntive</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.econlib.org/library/Topics/College/margins.html\"><u>Margini e pensiero al margine</u></a></li></ul><h2>Vedi anche</h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.probablygood.org/post/counterfactual-impact\"><u>Impatto controfattuale</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.probablygood.org/post/diminishing-returns\"><u>Rendimenti decrescenti</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.probablygood.org/post/neglectedness\"><u>Trascuratezza</u></a></li></ul>", "user": {"username": "EA Italy"}}, {"_id": "btmHXPx6rFqTBYWP7", "title": "Perch\u00e9 \u00e8 importante ridurre il rischio esistenziale", "postedAt": "2023-01-12T02:54:19.830Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>This is an Italian translation of </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8ZwK6poQYgfdSvGu8/the-case-for-reducing-existential-risk\"><i><strong>The case for reducing existential risk</strong></i></a></p><p>Nel 1939, Einstein scrisse a Roosevelt:<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1curjsufycj\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1curjsufycj\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><blockquote><p>Potrebbe essere possibile avviare una reazione nucleare a catena in una grande massa di uranio [...] ed \u00e8 immaginabile \u2014 anche se molto meno certo \u2014 che in questo modo si possano costruire bombe estremamente potenti di una nuova tipologia.</p></blockquote><p>Solo pochi anni dopo, quelle bombe vennero create.

Per esempio, \u201cClimate Change in the American Mind\u201d (maggio 2017,<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20171031033116/http://climatecommunication.yale.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Climate-Change-American-Mind-May-2017.pdf\"> link d\u2019archivio</a>) ha riscontrato che l\u2019americano medio ritiene che le probabilit\u00e0 di estinzione a causa del cambiamento climatico siano circa di 1 su 3. Questo sondaggio, per\u00f2, non ha posto un limite temporale preciso per lo scenario. Quando Greenberg ha tentato di replicare il risultato con la stessa domanda, ha ottenuto risposte simili. Ma quando ha chiesto della probabilit\u00e0 di estinzione per il cambiamento climatico nei prossimi 50 anni, la risposta mediana \u00e8 scesa ad appena l\u20191%. Molti altri studi inoltre non campionano correttamente le stime con bassa probabilit\u00e0 \u2014 tipicamente le persone non rispondono 0,00001% a meno che non gli venga esplicitamente presentata come opzione.</p><p>Ad ogni modo, com\u2019\u00e8 evidente, questo tipo di sondaggio tende a dare risultati molto variabili. Le risposte sembrano differire sulla base di come la domanda \u00e8 posta esattamente e in base al contesto. Questo \u00e8 in parte dovuto al fatto che le persone sono pessime nello stimare probabilit\u00e0 molto piccole. Ci\u00f2 rende difficile dare una stima precisa dell\u2019opinione generale della popolazione, ma nulla di ci\u00f2 che abbiamo rilevato contrasta l\u2019idea che un numero significativo di persone (diciamo pi\u00f9 del 25%) crede che le probabilit\u00e0 di estinzione nel breve periodo siano estremamente basse, e probabilmente pi\u00f9 basse di quella del solo impatto di un asteroide. Inoltre, la variabilit\u00e0 delle stime non sembra rassicurarci circa la razionalit\u00e0 con cui l\u2019umanit\u00e0 sta affrontando questi rischi.</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "EA Italy"}}, {"_id": "GBqxAgqWxwKTgqDfH", "title": "\u00c8 il nostro ultimo secolo?", "postedAt": "2023-01-12T02:36:42.441Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>This is an Italian translation of </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rwz7E7FWB59ngunrL/our-final-century\"><i><strong>Our final century?</strong></i></a></p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cQuindi se ci arrendessimo a soccombere a una catastrofe esistenziale, deluderemmo i nostri antenati in molti modi.

I think that this approach, while very popular in international development, is neglected in EA. While the capability approach has problems, I think that it provides a better approach to thinking about improving human welfare than approaches based on measuring happiness or subjective wellbeing (SWB) or approaches based on preference satisfaction. Finally, even if you disagree that the capability approach is best, I think this post will be useful to you because it may clarify why many people and organizations in the international development or global health space take the positions that they do. I will be drawing heavily on the work of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amartya_Sen\"><u>Amartya Sen</u></a>, but I will often not be citing specific texts because I\u2019m an academic and getting to write without careful citations is thrilling.</p><p>This post will have four sections. First, I will describe the capability approach. Second, I will give some simple examples that illustrate why I think that aiming to maximize capabilities<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3sta2z03ity\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3sta2z03ity\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;is the best way to do good for people. I\u2019ll frame these examples in opposition to other common approaches, but my goal here is mostly constructive and to argue for the capability approach rather than against maximizing, for example, SWB. Third, I will describe what I see as the largest downsides to the capability approach as well as possible responses to these downsides. Fourth and finally, I will explain my weakly-held theory that a lot of the ways that global health or international development organizations, including GiveWell, behave owes to the deep (but often unrecognized) influence of the capability approach on their thought.</p><h1>The capability approach</h1><p>The fundamental unit of the value in the capability approach is a&nbsp;<i>functioning,</i> which is anything that you can&nbsp;<i>be</i> or&nbsp;<i>do</i>. Eating is a functioning. Being an EA is a functioning. Other functionings include: being a doctor, running, practicing Judaism, sleeping, and being a parent.&nbsp;<i>Capabilities</i> are&nbsp;<i>options</i> to be or do a functioning.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3l2tv2myc2s\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3l2tv2myc2s\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The goal of the capability approach is not to maximize the number of capabilities available to people, it is instead to maximize the number of&nbsp;<i>sets&nbsp;</i>of capabilities. The notion here is that if you maximized simply the number of capabilities then you might enable someone to be: a parent or employed outside the home. But someone might want to do both. If you\u2019re focusing on maximizing the number of sets of capabilities then you\u2019ll end up with: parent, employed, both parent and employed, and neither. The simple beauty of this setup is that it is aiming to maximize the options that people have available to them, from which they then select the group of functionings that they want most. This is why one great book about this approach is entitled \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_as_Freedom\"><u>Development as Freedom</u></a>.\u201d The argument is that development is the process of expanding capabilities, or individual freedom to live the kind of life that you want.</p><p>I will come to criticisms later on, but one thing people may note is that this approach will lead to&nbsp;<i>a lot&nbsp;</i>of sets of capabilities and we will need some way to rank them or condense the list. In theory, we would want to do this based on how much people value each capability set. I will discuss this issue in more detail in the third section.</p><h1>Examples of why I love the capability approach</h1><p>Here I\u2019ll lay out a few examples that show why I think the capability approach is the best way to think about improving human welfare.</p><p>First, in opposition to preference-satisfaction approaches, the capability approach values options not taken. I think this accords with most of our intuitions, and that it takes real work for economics to train it out of people. Here are two examples:</p><ol><li>Imagine two children. The first has domineering parents that inform her that she has to grow up to be a doctor. They closely control her school and extracurriculars in order to make this happen, but she doesn\u2019t mind. As it happens she wants to be a doctor, and she will grow up to be a doctor. The second child has parents that tell her she can do what she wants and they broadly support her. She picks the same school and extracurricular options as the first child, and she also grows up to be a doctor. The two children had the same outcomes, and they both were able to select their top options for school, extracurriculars, and career. On most preference-satisfaction approaches they are equally well off. Under the capability approach, however, the second child was much better off as she had so many more options open to her.</li><li>Imagine two cities. In one, it is safe for women to walk around at night and in the second it is not. I think the former city is better even if women don\u2019t want to walk around at night, because I think that option is valuable to people&nbsp;<i>even if they do not take it.&nbsp;</i>Preference-satisfaction approaches miss this.</li></ol><p>Second, I think that the capability approach gives us a better sense of who is facing deprivation and a better sense of how to prioritize allocating resources/aid than other approaches. I think that this partially has to do with the fact that capabilities are genuine options to do functionings and so they are objective in a way that SWB or happiness is not. For example, you either do or do not have the option of being well nourished. This allows the capability approach to avoid some of the problems related to people possibly having odd functions relating some kind of aid to utility or happiness and therefore becoming either&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility_monster\"><u>utility monsters</u></a> or being considered unworthy of aid because the adversity that they face doesn\u2019t translate into SWB or utility.</p><p>As a toy example, we can imagine someone that has a low level of capabilities because of discrimination in their society. Such discrimination usually comes along with stories for why it is good or normal\u2014or it\u2019s simply taken for granted\u2014and so it isn\u2019t far-fetched to suggest that someone facing discrimination could have utility or happiness that is as high as people from groups that do not face such discrimination. One could conclude from this that there is nothing to be done, as discrimination doesn\u2019t affect happiness in this case. I find this repugnant, as the group facing discrimination has fewer capabilities. While this is a toy example, it\u2019s not hard to find real cases. For example, in the United States&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.econstor.eu/bitstream/10419/35143/1/576953326.pdf\"><u>women were happier than men in the 1970s</u></a>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefy02798gvjfb\"><sup><a href=\"#fny02798gvjfb\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Does this imply that we should have been focusing more on helping men than women in the 1970s? I doubt it, and my reasoning stems from the fact that it seems to me that 50 years ago women lacked many important capabilities that men had. Using subjective measures to allocate aid means that targeting will depend in part on people\u2019s ability to imagine a better future (and thus feel dissatisfaction with the present). I don\u2019t think conditioning aid on one\u2019s imagination is justified, and so I would prefer measures based on objective criteria such as whether or not one has the ability to do things (eat, vote, send kids to school).</p><p>Third,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/T975ydo3mx8onH3iS/ea-is-about-maximization-and-maximization-is-perilous\"><u>maximizing is (usually) perilous</u></a>. I think the perilousness of maximizing strongly applies to maximizing money or happiness or SWB, but I actually think maximizing capabilities is a lot safer because they are options. I\u2019ll give two examples, one personal and one that is (hopefully) more fanciful. Personally, I\u2019m nearly always a 7/10 or 8/10 on the common happiness-type questions. I guess that this means that I could \u201cimprove\u201d this, but honestly I\u2019m not trying to do this at all. Worse, if you told me that I was 10/10 happy over a long period of time I would be worried about my mental state. I don\u2019t want to be that happy. Like everyone, I\u2019m a confused mess of priorities. I want some happiness, but I also want to work hard on things even if it ends up making me sad. I want to build things both for other people, but also just so that they exist. I had kids even though I knew that in expectation they would make me less happy, and I don\u2019t regret this choice even a little. I want good art to exist literally for its own sake. Sometimes I feel good but then seek out art that makes me so sad that I cry. (Model that!) I want humans to better understand the laws of the universe, regardless of happiness. When I reflect on what I care about, I care about humans becoming wildly capable. Further, I expect that as we increase our options we will all care about different things and maximize different things. This fits the capability approach really well because it is giving us options. This does not fit any approach that seeks to maximize \u201cthe one best functioning.\u201d</p><p>More fancifully, imagine that we manage to successfully train a god-like AI to actually maximize something.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmv9he4bxea\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmv9he4bxea\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I think if we make that something \u201chappiness\u201d then we\u2019re in big trouble. We\u2019ll all end up on some IV drug drip or the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_machine\"><u>equivalent</u></a>, and to me that\u2019s a nightmare. However, if we maximize (value-weighted) capabilities then I think we\u2019re in a much better position because, again, these are just options available to people.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefi2jv8dvdf1s\"><sup><a href=\"#fni2jv8dvdf1s\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;My point here is<strong> not</strong> that this solves alignment or whatever, it\u2019s that if you agree that maximizing capabilities is not as fraught as maximizing other things, then that\u2019s a really big deal and strongly suggests that this approach is pointing us in a good direction.</p><p>The capability approach is less fraught than others because it is mostly agnostic about what people choose to do with their capabilities. This really matters because (1) we are so diverse, and (2) most optimizers (including us EAs) know less about what each person wants than they do. As a final example of this problem, let\u2019s consider the billions of very religious people alive right now, many of whom live in low-income countries. Do they want to maximize their personal happiness or SWB? The religious people I know do not seem to want to do that. They care, among other things, about their religious community and giving proper respect and glory to God, and they care about the afterlife. As EAs, we should try to give these (and all) people more options to do things that they care about. We should not impose on them our favourite functioning, like having high SWB.</p><h1>Downsides to the capability approach</h1><p>While strong in theory, the capability approach has a number of serious downsides that limit how fully it can be implemented in practice. I will describe some of them here, and why I think that despite these downsides the capability approach offers the best conceptual machinery for thinking about how to most improve human welfare.</p><p>The first (potential) downside is that the capability approach is highly liberal and anti-paternalistic. It treats individuals as the unit of analysis (groups of people cannot have capabilities) and it assumes that people know best what they want. The goal of policy makers, EAs, aid workers, or some godlike AI is to give people valuable options. People then get to pick for themselves what they actually want to do. If you are not liberal or if you are paternalistic, then you may not like the capability approach.</p><p>A second downside is that the number of sets of capabilities is incredibly large, and the value that we would assign to each capability set likely varies quite a bit, making it difficult to cleanly measure what we might optimize for in an EA context. When faced with this problem people do a few things. If you\u2019re&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martha_Nussbaum\"><u>Martha Nussbaum</u></a> you end up making a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://daily-philosophy.com/martha-nussbaum-and-the-capabilities-approach/\"><u>master list of capabilities</u></a> and then try to get people to focus on those. This is unattractive to me. If you\u2019re Amartya Sen, you embrace the chaos and try to be pragmatic. Yes, it\u2019s true that people would rank capability sets differently and that they\u2019re very high dimensional, but that\u2019s because life is actually like this. We should not see this and run away to the safety of clean (and surely wrong) simple indices. Instead, we should try to find ways of dealing with this chaos that are approximately right. Here are three examples that start with the theory of the capability approach but then make pragmatic concessions in order to try to be approximately right. My goal in giving these examples is not to say that these are ideal, but just to give illustrations about how people try to start from the capability approach and then move into the realm of practice.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_Development_Index\"><u>Human Development Index</u></a> grew out of a desire to have a country-level index that was inspired by the capability approach. This was from the start going to look odd, as countries cannot have capabilities. The approach ended with a sort of average of country-level scores on education, health, and productivity. There are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1683903\"><u>all kinds of issues</u></a> with this, but I think it has value relative to an alternative that says \u201cthe HDI is confusing or assigns hard-to-defend weights to some dimension, so I will give 100% weight to dimension x (income, happiness) and 0% to everything else.\u201d I\u2019d rather us be approximately right rather than precisely wrong.</p><p>The second way of operationalizing the capability approach is to push things down to the level of individuals and then do a roughly similar kind of exercise. This yields, for example, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_Poverty_Index\"><u>Multidimensional Poverty Index</u></a>.</p><p>The third approach, which I personally prefer, is to not even try to make an index but instead to track various clearly important dimensions separately and to try to be open and pragmatic and get lots of feedback from the people \u201cbeing helped.\u201d If you take this approach and think about it a bit, then you will realize that there are two things that are very important to a very large number of capability sets. Those things are (1) being alive, and (2) having resources, which often means money. The argument for this should be familiar to EAs, as it\u2019s very similar to why some of us think that AI agents might try to not be turned off and to gather resources: These things are generally very useful.</p><h1>The influence of the capability approach</h1><p>This leads me to my last point, which is that the capability approach has been so influential in international development thought that many people and organizations do things that make sense under the capability approach even though they may not realize it. The Keynes quote about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/212215-practical-men-who-believe-themselves-to-be-quite-exempt-from\"><u>practical men</u></a> applies here, though incredibly Amartya Sen is still alive.</p><p>The most relevant example of this to EA is in GiveWell and OpenPhil both prioritizing income gains and lives saved as privileged metrics. This has been sometimes criticized, but under the capability approach it makes a lot of sense. If you don\u2019t know precisely what to maximize for people, then picking staying alive and having resources is a very good start. I don\u2019t know if people at these organizations actively read Sen or other related writers, but I think the capability approach offers a powerful defense of this choice. Money and staying alive are not necessarily where you want to end up, but they are very good starting points.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>Thanks to anyone who read this far. If you want more,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674452565\"><u>Inequality Re-examined</u></a> by Amartya Sen is quite good. I\u2019d also recommend the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/capability-approach/\"><u>capability approach</u></a> page of the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, which goes into details on key issues that I glossed over.</p><p>\u2014</p><p>Minor edit: it was (correctly) pointed out to me on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hendersonhl22/status/1613944715296280576?s=20\">twitter</a> that the capability approach claims \"that capabilities are the appropriate space for well-being comparisons and says nothing about whether capabilities should be maximized.\" He's right.

The over-stabilized economy of the 1990s accumulated imbalances that led to the Great Recession. The democracies abandoned their Cold War militant position and accepted the Hegelian inevitability of universal democratization as their geopolitical stance reaching all kinds of pacts with the dictatorships under the hypothesis (structurally correct, conjuncturally wrong) that economic growth leads to democratization.</p><p>However, the main characteristic of the period are not these objective processes, but the degradation of expectations and the lack of social ambition. In technology the period 1991-2022 was a time of automation stagnation (in an environment of general cheapening of the labor factor) and the oligopolization of the Internet.</p><p>In the field of social emancipation an entire generation embarked into the repetition as a farce of the previous generation historical struggles. In the 1960s, African-Americans achieved full legal equality and they become politically enfranchized, and in the 1970s, women accessed reproductive control and labour market participation, and homosexuality ceased to be penalized. All these processes happened in parallel to the liquidation of the remains of the European colonial empires and the establishment of the Welfare State.</p><p>The beginning of the XXI century gave us a purely virtual but quite aggressive version of those same historical struggles, centered around a Maoist Cultural Revolution on the United States elite campuses: extravagant proposals like eliminating prison or defund the police and a strange grammatical etiquette on the use of pronouns are only the surface of an agenda focused on: i) the political mobilization of all identity (racial, religious or sexual) cracks, and ii) the imposition of a medieval epistemology, where the defense of faith and the religious- identity feeling is considered a higher value than the search for objective truth (the strict denial of the kantian \u201cSapere Aude\u201d).</p><p><strong>2.-Rethinking priorities</strong></p><p>However, this microscopic and hysterical activism cannot change the reality that the amount of current suffering (human and animal) is still huge and Humanity faces existential risks.</p><p>Faced with the politicization of identity, a progressive and universalist ideological proposal had to appear. Social science and ethical theory have been clarified and developed in the last forty years, to the point where <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4viLtxnwzMawqdPum/time-consistency-for-the-ea-community-projects-that-bridge\">we have knowledge to seriously affect social governance</a>, and to the point where animal suffering can no longer be ignored.</p><p>Although I sympathize with the anti-identity resistance (vg . <a href=\"https://quillette.com/2019/10/05/the-dangerous-life-of-an-anthropologist/\">Quillette</a>) and the movement to defend <a href=\"https://academicfreedom.org/\">academic freedom of expression</a>, their political defeat is as inevitable as that of any other defensive and partialist political movement that has to face an aggressive worldview. Culture wars cannot be \u201cwon\u201d (the fight itself fuels the tumor process), but rather they have to be superseded.</p><p>Right now the only thing that can save the open societies of the West (and prevent a future of nuclear war and/or widespread tyranny) is a surge of institutional and moral progress and a worldview to backs it up. Although no concrete community can be the sole agent of these transformations, the Rationalist+ Effective Altruist community is the true political vanguard of our age.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3.-The Bostrom case and Human Biodiversity</strong></p><p>The radical opposition between the woke culture and the EA and Rationalist communities cannot escape any observer with the least bit of political sophistication. The clash is inevitable, and like all conflicts between socially adjacent ideologies (this is a war for the hearts and minds of the Professional Managerial Class) it's going to be violent.</p><p>The recent weaponization of Nick Bostrom 's youth emails where he used the supreme taboo of the time (racial differences) in a rhetorical example seems the first shot of this existential struggle.</p><p>Bostrom 's apology is, for his part, an example of political wisdom and long-term vision. The original post is hardly defensible, &nbsp;but in epistemological matters, he does not choose the easy route of the kowtow: <i>\u201cAre there any genetic contributors to differences between groups in cognitive abilities? It is not my area of expertise, and I don\u2019t have any particular interest in the question. I would leave to others, who have more relevant knowledge, to debate whether or not in addition to environmental factors, epigenetic or genetic factors play any role\u201d.</i></p><p>Bolstrom 's position refusing to take sides on a factual scientific issue for political convenience, is exemplary not only in the realm of morality and personal example. It is a matter of political survival. The separation between value and fact, between \"will\" and \"representation\" is one of the most essential epistemological facts. Reality is what it is, and our assessment of it does not alter it. Statements of fact have truth value, not moral value. No descriptive belief can ever be \"good\" or \"bad.\" The black-white IQ gap is precisely the canonical example of this principle: its existence and its causes (whatever they may be) are objective facts, and no one can be morally judged for their sincere opinions about this part of reality. Or rather, <i>of course one must morally judge and roundly condemn anyone who alters their descriptive beliefs about reality for political convenience</i>. This is exactly what is called \u201cmotivated thought\u201d.</p><p>Bostrom is not very sincere when he says that the subject \"does not interest him.\" From the precision with which he talks about the subject it is clear that he knows the subject in some depth. Cognitive analysis of human biodiversity (and anthropological sociobiology) are the most fiercely politicized fields of fundamental research. Cancellation culture in these realms dates back to the <a href=\"https://quillette.com/2019/10/05/the-dangerous-life-of-an-anthropologist/\">Chagnon 's affaire</a> and to the first edition of E.O. Wilson\u2019s Sociobiology.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Behavioral-Genetics-Robert-Plomin/dp/1429205776\">Behavioral genetics</a> has found several results of enormous social importance: we can confirm that IQ is strongly heritable, that has increased steadily in recent decades, and that among relatively small and isolated ethnic groups IQ differences can be substantial relative to surrounding populations (the canonical case is the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16867211/\">Cochrane paper on Askhenazi IQ</a>, but there are probably other cases in countries with multiple endogamous groups such as India and others in Africa).</p><p>Across large racial groups, however, the observed differences are statistically significant but modest (as they are for other anthropometric characters), and given the social <i>and cultural</i> disparities across racial groups and the social plasticity of IQ the share of biological causality on the observed racial IQ &nbsp;gap is a difficult and controversial research problem. Bostrom has not scientific legitimacy to give an opinion in such a technical and disputed issue.</p><p>Regarding feelings and human sympathy, the big question is: whose feelings? How can a modest difference in the mean of the IQ distribution offend a black man with an IQ of 130? And if you are a white person with an IQ of 85, how useful is for you the white black IQ gap <i>for which you make a negative contribution</i>? IQ is a personal characteristic, and means are completely irrelevant for every single person.</p><p>If we believe that IQ is important for some application, we can measure it directly at the individual level instead of looking at skin color. Anti-racist arguments do not depend on the distribution of psychometric variables. They depend on treating each person as an individual, ignoring skin color, and exclusively considering the abilities and limitations relevant to the case considered of the person under scrutiny. Any \u201canti-racism\u201d in excess of this, is, in fact, racism</p>", "user": {"username": "Arturo Macias"}}, {"_id": "f2qojPr8NaMPo2KJC", "title": "Beware safety-washing", "postedAt": "2023-01-13T10:39:04.081Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Tl;dr: don\u2019t be fooled into thinking that some groups working on AI are taking \u201csafety\u201d concerns seriously (enough).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6zkt67gme6q\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6zkt67gme6q\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p><strong>Outline</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/f2qojPr8NaMPo2KJC/beware-safety-washing#Two_non_AI_examples\">Two non-AI examples</a><ul><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/f2qojPr8NaMPo2KJC/beware-safety-washing#Greenwashing\">Greenwashing</a></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/f2qojPr8NaMPo2KJC/beware-safety-washing#Humanewashing\">Humanewashing</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/f2qojPr8NaMPo2KJC/beware-safety-washing#Definition_of_safety_washing\">Definition of safety-washing</a></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/f2qojPr8NaMPo2KJC/beware-safety-washing#What_are_the_harms_\">What are the harms?&nbsp;</a></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/f2qojPr8NaMPo2KJC/beware-safety-washing#What_can__and_should__we_do_about_this_\">What can (and should) we do about this?</a></li></ul><p><i>Note: I\u2019m posting this in my personal capacity.

A recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://co-nxt.com/blog/food-label-claims-that-make-consumers-more-likely-to-buy/\"><u>national survey</u></a> by C.O.nxt, a food marketing firm, found that animal welfare and \u201cnatural\u201d claims on meat, dairy, and egg packaging increased the intent to purchase for over half of consumers.</p><p>[...]</p><p>...rather than engaging in the costly endeavor of actually changing their farming practices, far too many major meat producers are attempting to assuage consumer concerns by merely changing their packaging and advertising with claims of sustainable farms and humane treatment.

I made a couple of minor edits and corrections for clarity.</i></p><p>Hello everyone, and thank you for coming to this talk. Thank you Theron for the introduction.&nbsp;</p><p>I find effective altruism is what people actually want to talk about, which is a good thing. So I thought I would talk about it as well. And I'll start by giving two big reasons why I'm favorably inclined, but then work through a number of details where I might differ from effective altruism.&nbsp;</p><p>So let me give you what I think are the two big pluses. They're not the only pluses. But to me, they're the two reasons why in the net ledger, it's strongly positive.&nbsp;</p><p>The first is that simply as a youth movement, effective altruism seems to attract more talented young people than anything else I know of right now by a considerable margin. And I've observed this by running my own project, Emergent Ventures for Talented Young People. And I just see time and again, the smartest and most successful people who apply get grants. They turn out to have connections to the EA movement. And that's very much to the credit of effective altruism. Whether or not you agree with everything there, that to me is a more important fact about the movement than anything else you might say about it. Unlike some philosophers, I do not draw a totally rigorous and clear distinction between what you might call the conceptual side of effective altruism and the more sociological side. They're somewhat intertwined and best thought of as such.&nbsp;</p><p>The second positive point that I like about effective altruism is simply that what you might call traditional charity is so terrible, such a train wreck, so poorly conceived and ill thought out and badly managed and run that anything that waves its arms and says, hey, we should do better than this, again, whether or not you agree with all of the points, that has to be a big positive. So whether or not you think we should send more money to anti-malaria bed nets, the point is effective altruism is forcing us all to rethink what philanthropy should be. And again, that for me is really a very significant positive.&nbsp;</p><p>Now before I get to some of the more arcane points of difference or at least different emphasis, let me try to outline some core propositions of effective altruism, noting I don't think there's a single dominant or correct definition. It's a pretty diverse movement. I learned recently there's like a sub movement, effective altruism for Christians. I also learned there's a sub sub movement, effective altruism for Quakers. So I don't think there's any one way to sum it all up, but I think you'll recognize these themes as things you see appearing repeatedly.&nbsp;</p><p>So my first group of themes will be those where contemporary effective altruism differs a bit from classic utilitarianism. And then I'll give two ways in which effective altruism is fairly similar to classical utilitarianism.&nbsp;</p><p>So here are three ways I think current effective altruism has evolved from classical utilitarianism and is different:</p><ul><li>The first is simply an emphasis on existential risk, the notion that the entire world could end, world of humans at least, and this would be a very terrible thing. I don't recall having read that, say, in Bentham or in John Stuart Mill. It might be in there somewhere, but it certainly receives far, far more emphasis today than it did in the 19th century.&nbsp;</li><li>The second point, which I think is somewhat in classical utilitarianism, is this notion of legibility, the idea that your standards for where to give money or where to give aid should somehow be presentable, articulable, reproducible. People ought to be able to see why, for instance, you think investing in anti-malaria bed nets is better than, say, giving a lot of money to Cornell University. So maybe that's a sociological difference. It may or may not be a logical requirement of effective altruism, but again, it's something I see quite clearly in the movement, a desire for a certain kind of clarity of decision.&nbsp;</li><li>The third point is what is sometimes called scalability. That is the notion that what you can do when its final impacts are scaled up might be of truly enormous importance. So for instance, if we sidestep existential risk and keep on growing our civilization in some manner, you might decide that, well, 10,000 years from now, we can colonize the galaxy and there can be trillions and trillions of individuals or cyborgs or whatever doing incredible things and that there's this potential for scale and the highest value outcomes and that that should play a role in our decision making. So the point of scalability being a third difference between current effective altruism and classical utilitarianism. You can actually find Sidgwick being concerned with scalability as something important. Parfit obviously was somewhat obsessed with scalability, but still overall, I think it's a big difference between current effective altruism and what you might call classical utilitarianism of the 19th century.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Now, I'm going to get back to each of those. Here's two ways in which effective altruism to me seems really quite similar to classical utilitarianism:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The first is simply a notion of the great power of philosophy, the notion that philosophy can be a dominant guide in guiding one's decisions. Not too long ago, I did a podcast with William MacAskill. You all probably know him and his work. I think the main point of difference that emerged between the two of us is that Will has a very ambitious view for what philosophy can be, that it ultimately can in some way guide or rule all of your normative decisions. My personal view is much more modest. I see philosophy as one useful tool. I think there's just flat outright personal prudence. There's managerial science, there's economics, there's history, there's consulting with friends, there's a whole bunch of different things out there. In my view, true prudential wisdom is to somehow at the personal level have a way of weighting all those different inputs. I find when I speak to Will or someone like Nick Bostrom, they're much more \u201crah-rah philosophy\u201d. Philosophy is going to rule all these things and they ultimately fall under its rubric and you need philosophy to make them commensurable. That I think is something quite significant in effective altruism. That's one of the areas where I depart from what effective altruism, at least in some of its manifestations, would recommend.&nbsp;</li><li>Another notion you find both in effective altruism and classical utilitarianism is a strong emphasis on impartiality. The notion that we should be neutral across geographic space, people living say in Africa, Vietnam, wherever, they're not worth less than people living in our own country. That people in our own village are not worth more. Across time, we should be impartial. A lot of different ways in which both effective altruism and classical utilitarianism suggest that most other perspectives, they're simply far too partial in the sense of taking someone's side and then trying to optimize returns for that side. That again strikes me as quite a strong feature of most effective altruism. On that too, I have some differences.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Let me introduce the sequence of differences with effective altruism by starting with this notion of impartiality. My view is at the margin, if I may be forgiven for speaking like an economist, virtually all individuals and certainly all governments, they're far, far too partial. The effective altruist notion at current margins, I think is correct 100% of the time that we should be more impartial. I'm sure you all know Peter Singer's famous 1972 article, The Child is Drowning in the Pond, You Can Save the Child, It May Soil Your Coat. Obviously, you should do it. You shouldn't just say, oh, it's not my kid. I don't need to worry about this. At current margins, I'm fully on board with what you might call the EA algorithm. At the same time, I don't accept it as a fully triumphant philosophic principle that can be applied quite generally across the board or as we economists would say, inframarginally.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me just give you a simple example. I gave this to Will McCaskill in my podcast with him, and I don't think he had any good answer to my question. And I said to Will, well, Will, let's say aliens were invading the earth and they were going to take us over, in some way enslave us or kill us and turn over all of our resources to their own ends. I said, would you fight on our side or would you first sit down and make a calculation as to whether the aliens would be happier using those resources than we would be? Now, Will, I think, didn't actually have an answer to this question. As an actual psychological fact, virtually all of us would fight on the side of the humans, even assuming we knew nothing about the aliens or even if we somehow knew, well, they would be happier ruling over and enslaved planet earth than we would be happy doing whatever we would do with planet earth. But there's simply in our moral decisions some inescapable partiality.&nbsp;</p><p>And this is a way in which I think David Hume, for instance, was by no means a pure utilitarian. He saw this partiality as an inescapable feature of human psychology. I would go further than that. I would stress that the fact that it's an inescapable feature of human psychology means at the normative level, there's just no way we can fully avoid partiality of some kind, even though you might think, as I do, like in all of our current real world decisions, we are far too partial and not sufficiently impartial. It seems to me there's always a big enough comparison you can make, an absurd enough philosophic thought experiment where when you pose the question, should we do X or Y, it is impossible to address that question without having a somewhat partial perspective. So that's the way in which I differ from effective altruism or some versions of it at a philosophic level, even though in terms of practical recommendations, I would say I'm fully on board at the margin.&nbsp;</p><p>Now it turns out that this view of impartiality, that you can't be fully impartial\u2026 it's going to matter for a number of our real world decisions. Let me turn to an example of where I think we cannot help but be partial. So when it comes to scalability, effective altruists stress the upward potential for these fantastic outcomes where we colonize the galaxy, there's trillions of people, they may not even be people anymore, they might be uploads or we're all transhumanist, or there's just some wildly utopian future. I'm not sure we're able to process that as a meaningful outcome. That doesn't mean I don't value the option on it or the possibility, but I'm not sure there's any kind of utilitarian algorithm where you can calculate the expected value of an outcome so different from the world we are familiar with.&nbsp;</p><p>And let me bring this back to a very well-known philosophic conundrum taken from Derek Parfit, namely the repugnant conclusion. Now Parfit's repugnant conclusion asks the question, which I think you're all familiar with, like should we prefer a world of 200 billion individuals who have lives as rich as Goethe, Beethoven, whoever your exemplars might be, or should we prefer a world of many, many trillions, make it as asymptotically large as you need to be, many, many trillions of people, but living at the barest of levels that make life worth living, Parfit referred to them as lives of musak and potatoes. So in Parfit's vision of these lives, you wake up when you're born, you hear a little bit of musak, maybe it's slightly above average musak, they feed you a spoonful of potatoes, which you enjoy, and then you perish. Now most people, because of Parfit's mere addition principle, would admit there's some value in having this life of musak and potatoes compared to no life at all, but if you think through mathematics, if you add up enough of those lives, it would seem a sufficiently large number of those lives is a better world than like the 200 billion people living like Goethe.&nbsp;</p><p>There's a huge literature on the repugnant conclusion. I'm not really going to address it, but I'll simply give you my conclusion. I'm quite sure that no one has really solved the repugnant conclusion. There are different attempts to wiggle or worm or squiggle one's way out of it, but I think the actual answer to the repugnant conclusion is that the lives of all those musak and potatoes entities, they're not really human lives as we understand them. If you consistently think through the existence of a musak and potatoes entity, I don't think there's any particular animal you could compare it to, but again, it's not really intelligible in terms of our normal human existence. In comparing the lives of the Goethes to the musak and potato lives, I would just say we're comparing two different species. When you compare two different species, I don't think there's a single well-defined unit of utility that enables you to say which one is better. There's not an answer. I think the so-called answer, if you would call it that, some would call it a non-answer, but it's Hume's observation that we cannot help but be somewhat partial and prefer the lives of the recognizably human entities, the 200 billion Goethes. We side against the repugnant conclusion. There's not actually some formally correct utility calculation that should push us in the opposite direction.&nbsp;</p><p>I think you can say the formal utility calculation is not well-defined. What we're left with is our particularistic siding with the human-like entities. I think that reflects the actual intuitions we have in rejecting Parfit\u2019s repugnant conclusion.</p><p>Now, once you admit that, once you say that in a lot of these comparisons, we are intrinsically particularistic and somewhat biased and have a partial point of view, I think when you look at issues such as animal welfare, you also have to wonder how much you can make formal comparisons. My view on animal welfare is that at the margin, we are very systematically underinvesting in the welfare of non-human animals, and this is a terrible thing. At the margin, we should correct it, but I don't actually think there's some aggregate calculus that you can add up and arrive at an answer of, well, what exactly should humans do to maximize total well-being on the planet, weighing off all human well-being against the total well-being of all non-human animals? Any view on that topic strikes me as intrinsically underjustified while admitting that at the margin, we're not doing nearly enough to take care of the welfare of non-human animals. I just don't think there's a natural unit of comparison.</p><p>I observe very large numbers of EA people being vegetarians, being vegan. If I'm going to meet an EA person for a meal, I don't even ask them. I just make sure like we go to an Indian restaurant where they can get some good food that's not just meat. I assume at least 50% chance they're vegetarian or vegan, and that's fine. I think at the margin, it's a better way to be. But at the same time, the notion that in a world with about 8 billion humans, that we have taken up about half of all inhabitable land for agriculture, and yes, we could make that more efficient, but by the end of the day, once we start addressing climate change by putting in a lot more panels for solar energy, we're going to take up a lot more land in fact, producing green energy under most plausible scenarios. So it seems to me in any world with billions of humans, you end up doing something to a large number of species of animals, which resembles extermination or near extermination. I don't think I have a normative theory that tells me how justified or not justified that is. I am pretty sure I have the partial perspective of a human being that just tells me, well, we're going to do it anyway. There's not an equilibrium where we like ceed the land to the cockroaches because we realize they're a slight bit happy and you can fit more of them on my house than you can fit of me. Just not going to happen. So again, this notion that there's something there at the margin, but at the macro level, there's just not a meaningful comparison would be an area where I differ from a lot of effective altruists. Not all of them by any means, but I think a lot of them take these very philosophic, very utilitarian, very macro views of how we should make these decisions.</p><p>This also relates to what I gave as one of the definitions of EA, that they're very concerned with moral decisions being legible. Again, I'm not opposed to legibility, but I think relative to most EA types I know, I see a large number of moral decisions\u2014I mean, really a very large number of important moral decisions\u2014that simply will never be legible because they are intrinsically partial to some extent. So I sort of admire the quest for legibility at the margin. I think it's a good thing in the actual world we live in, but I'm not quite as enthusiastic about it as a macro normative paradigm the way some EA individuals would be.&nbsp;</p><p>A big area of difference that I think I have with a lot of effective altruist types is the emphasis on existential risk. So just if you look at the EA movement, what you might call sociologically, I see two different, somewhat separate parts of it. They're intertwined in institutions, but the first part of EA, practically speaking, is the part of EA that does charity, invests in anti-malaria bed nets, tries to prepare the world for the next pandemic and so on, doing very what you might call prosaic things, but trying to do them better and more rationally than preexisting philanthropy had done. And I find I'm 100% on board with that, 110%. The second part of the EA movement is concerned with a whole series of investments in fighting existential risk. So very often this takes the form of worry that artificial intelligence will turn into some form of AGI that may pulp us into paperclips or destroy us or have its way with the world and then human civilization as we know it. It's an interesting question, like historically, sociologically, why that's become intertwined with the anti-malaria bed nets, but it has. And I think actually for some decent reasons. But I would just say I'm in general more skeptical about the extreme emphasis on existential risk than a lot of effective altruism would be.</p><p>One reason for that is simply how I diagnose the main sources of existential risk. So if you think the main existential risk worry is AGI, that would lead you to one set of actions. If you think the main existential risk is nuclear war or some kind of major war with other weapons of mass destruction, possibly in the future, it leads you to a very different set of actions. So I think nuclear war, just general warfare, is a larger risk than AGI is. So I would fully recognize the EA point that a major nuclear war is unlikely to kill each and every human being on planet Earth. But I think it would wipe out civilization as we know it, would set us back many millennia. And I don't think there's an obvious path toward recovery. And in the meantime, we're much more vulnerable to all these other existential risks, like a comet or asteroid might come. And we can't do anything to deflect it because we have something only a bit above the Stone Age existence. So I'm at least 50x more worried about nuclear war than at least some of the EA people I know who are more worried about AGI.&nbsp;</p><p>But now let's look at the risk of nuclear war. Like what now are the two major risks of nuclear war, at least plausibly? We don't know for certain. One would be the war in Ukraine where Putin has said he might use nuclear weapons. Possibly that could escalate. I don't think it's the likely scenario, but at this point you have to see some chance of that. And the other major risk in terms of a significant war would be China attempting to reincorporate Taiwan within its boundaries. The US has pledged to defend Taiwan. You could imagine there's some chance of that leading to a major nuclear war. But then if you ask the question, well, which investments should we make to limit the risk of nuclear war over Ukraine or Taiwan? I'm very keen on everyone doing more work in that area, but I don't think the answers are very legible. I don't think they're very obvious. I don't think effective altruism really has anything in particular to add to those debates. I don't mean that as a criticism. Like I don't think I have anything in particular to add to those debates. They're just very hard questions. But once you see those as the major existential risk questions, the notion that existential risk as a thing should occupy this central room in the effective altruism house, that just seems like a weaker conclusion to me, that yes, of course, we should worry about nuclear war. We should do whatever we can. More people should study it, debate it, whatever. But it just seems like an ordinary world where you're telling people, well, think more about foreign policy, which again, all for, I don't think effective altruism is opposed to that conclusion.&nbsp;</p><p>There's plenty of EA forums where people debate nuclear war and would say things I pretty much would agree with. But again, at the end of the day, I think it significantly weakens existential risk as the central room in the EA house. And EA just tends to dribble away into a kind of normal concern with global affairs that you would have found in the American foreign policy establishment in 1953 in a quite acceptable way. But EA then just isn't special anymore.&nbsp;</p><p>I think there's a way in which EA people, they don't take existential risks seriously enough. So let's say you think in any year there's a chance of a major nuclear war. My personal view is that chance is really quite small. So I'm not in that sense a pessimist. I probably think it's smaller than most people think it is. But what I do do, and people hate me for this, I'm going to depress you all for the rest of your lives, is just ask the simple question. If we have a tiny risk in a single year, for how many years does the clock have to tick before that small risk happens? This is a well-known problem in financial theory. But basically, within the span of a thousand years or maybe shorter, there's quite a good chance in my calculations that the world has something like a major nuclear war, or maybe the weapons are different by that point in time. But you get what I'm saying. And that even if you're optimistic for any single year, you shouldn't be optimistic over a time span of a thousand years.&nbsp;</p><p>This problem gets all the worse when you imagine that nuclear weapons right now, only a small number of nations can afford them. But the cost of producing those or other very powerful weapons is likely to decline if we continue to have technological progress. And so the number of agents who have the ability to destroy a big part of the world just because they're pissed off, crazy, feuding with each other, whatever, that number of agents is really only likely to go up, not to go down. So once you think like the world as we know it has a likely time horizon shorter than one thousand years, this notion of, well, what we will do in thirty thousand years to colonize the galaxy and have trillions of uploads or transhuman beings, you know, manipulating stars, it just doesn't seem very likely. The chance of it is not zero. But the whole problem to me starts looking more like Pascal's wager and less like a probability that should actually influence my decision making. So that whole strand of thought, I just feel I'm different from it. Again, I would fully recognize the people would agree with things I would say about nuclear war. I view them as a positive force, raising consciousness about the risk of nuclear war. But just sociologically, the entities they have constructed around the issue of existential risk, they just feel very, very different from how I would view that issue.&nbsp;</p><p>Another way that I think how I view existential risk is different from how many of the E.A. individuals view it. Actually I look at many, in particular, artificial intelligence issues from a national perspective, not a global perspective. So I think if you could wave a magic wand and stop all the progress of artificial intelligence, I'm not going to debate that debate now, but I'll just say I can see the case for just stopping it if you can wave the magic wand. Well, it's too dangerous, it's too risky and so on. We all know those arguments. But my view is you never have the magic wand at the global level. The UN is powerless. We're not about to set up some transnational thing that has any real influence over those decisions. Different nations are doing it. China is doing it. And the real question to ask is, do you want the U.S. to come in first and China to come in second, or rather China to come in first and the U.S. to come in second? It's just a very, very different question than should we wave the magic wand to stop the whole thing. Now, I don't want to debate that question either, but I'll just tell you my perspective, which is in part partial, as I discussed earlier, but in part I think just broadly utilitarian is I want the U.S. to win. So I think we should go full steam ahead on AI. And I think that for reasons I don't hear sufficiently frequently from the E.A. community, namely that the real question is U.S. gets it or China gets it. Then you have to pick a side and you can pick the side for utilitarian reasons, or you might in part pick the side for reasons that are, you know, partialistic. But nonetheless, freezing it all is not on the table.&nbsp;</p><p>I even worry that the people who obsess over AI alignment, I suspect their net impact to date has been to make AI riskier by getting everyone thinking about these scenarios through which AI could do these terrible things. So the notion that you just talk about or even try to do AI alignment, I don't think it's going to work. I think the problem is if AI is powerful enough to destroy everything, it's the least safe system you have to worry about. So you might succeed with AI alignment on say 97 percent of cases, which would be a phenomenal success ratio, right? No one like seriously expects to succeed on 97 percent of cases. But if you failed on 3 percent of cases, that 3 percent of very evil, effective enough AIs can still reproduce and take things over and turn you into paper clips. So I'm just not that optimistic about the alignment agenda. And I think you need to view it from a national perspective, not like where's the magic wand that's going to set all of this right. And in that sense, I think I'm different from EAs as I meet them.&nbsp;</p><p>I can readily imagine a somewhat reformed EA that would say, well, when we consider all possible factors, we should really take something more like Tyler's view. But again, I think as you do that, this place that existential risk has as a central room in the EA house, that again tends to dribble away quite a bit.&nbsp;</p><p>Now I'm almost done. I believe no Zoom talk should be so long and we have time for Q&amp;A. But let me just say a few things about EA as a movement. And again, I don't think you can fully separate the movement from its philosophy.&nbsp;</p><p>I think for virtually all social movements, I have a saying, and that is \u201cdemographics is destiny\u201d. And you may like this or you may not like it. But it is also true for people in effective altruism. It's been true for people who are libertarianism. So if you look at early libertarianism, say in the 1970s, it had a very particular logical structure. But the actual descriptive fact of the matter was that a lot of libertarians were nerdy white males and some other set of libertarians were non-nerdy, somewhat rural, kind of gun owning anti-authoritarian, very US American white males who had a particular set of grudges. And what you end up getting from libertarianism is some evolution of those socioeconomic groups, which again, you might like or you might not like. But if you're evaluating libertarianism, you have to think a bit, well, what are the natural constituencies? What will those demographics get you? Do you like all of that? And are you ready for the stupider version of the theory?&nbsp;</p><p>So there's like the Robert Nozick super smart, very sophisticated libertarianism. But of course, that's not what you get. You get the stupider version. So you have to ask with effective altruism, well, what is the stupider version of effective altruism and what are its demographics and what does that mean is its destiny? I have limited experience in the EA movement, but at least in the United States, and I would readily admit other countries may differ. In the United States, it's quite young, very high IQ, very coastal, very educated, but broadly people with the social conscience. None of that should be surprising, right? But I think the demographics of the EA movement are essentially the US Democratic Party. And that's what the EA movement over time will evolve into. If you think the existential risk is this kind of funny, weird thing, it doesn't quite fit. Well, it will be kind of a branch of Democratic Party thinking that makes philanthropy a bit more global, a bit more effective. I wouldn't say it's a stupider version, but it's a less philosophical version that's a lot easier to sell to non-philosophers. Just so you end up telling people you should think more broadly about how you should give money at the margin, I agree with that. I'm fine with it. But it's simply another way of thinking about what effective altruism really is, just as it is with libertarianism, just to understand that demographics is destiny.&nbsp;</p><p>I gave a talk to an EA group lately, and I'm always like a troll when I give these talks. That's on purpose, but I'm saying things I believe, to be clear. I'm not making up stuff I don't believe. So I said to them all, you EAers, you should be more religious, and a lot of you should be social conservatives, because social conservatism is actually better for human welfare. I didn't mean that in the sense of government coercively enforcing social conservatism on people, but just people voluntarily being more socially conservative. I said a lot of you should do a lot more to copy the Mormons. Maybe now I would say the Quakers, other groups too. What was striking to me was how shocked everyone was by this point. I'm not saying they should have agreed or not agreed, but they hadn't ever heard it before. Will McAskill said this in his podcast with me. He said, oh, where are all social liberals? That doesn't really follow at all. It's something you can debate. But the fact that so many people took it for granted to me gets back at this point. When it comes to EA, demographics is destiny, and the future of socially conservative EA is really not that strong, but it should be. And after my talk, a woman went up to me and she came over and she whispered in my ear and she said, you know, Tyler, I actually am a social conservative and an effective altruist, but please don't tell anyone. I thought that was awesome. And of course, I didn't tell anyone who she was. But the mere fact that she felt the need to whisper this to me gets back to demographics is destiny.&nbsp;</p><p>So in part, when you think about EA, don't just think about the philosophic propositions. Think about what it is, what it is becoming. And again, in the United States, at least, it is a very specific set of sociological connections that will shape its future. I like many of those trends at the margin, but I would say not all of them. And just looking at EA that way would be another way in which I differ from a lot of the effective altruists themselves, noting that when I mentioned social conservatism, they just all were shocked. I don't think they agreed with me, but for me, the important point was that they were shocked that I would bring up such a thing. They just took it for granted that effective altruist people ought to be social liberals.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, with that, I will end my formal remarks. I know we have a five-minute break, according to the customs of St. Andrews. That would be one of these customs that I think Coleridge would have approved of, St. Andrews being an endowed institution and Coleridge being one of the great critics of the effective altruist movements of his own day. So, we now take our break.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>The talk was followed by roughly an hour of Q&amp;A (not transcribed).&nbsp;</p><p>The Q&amp;A begins 36 minutes and 40 seconds into the recording.</p>", "user": {"username": "Peter_Hartree"}}, {"_id": "WK7EM57j5whNivA6P", "title": "Junior Congressional Staffer looking for guidance", "postedAt": "2023-01-13T17:48:52.611Z", "htmlBody": "<p>I am a junior congressional staffer in the U.S. Senate.

I first learned about the variability hypothesis\u2014i.e., the idea that females display less variability in cognitive ability than males\u2014from a male EA. Unlike the claim that \u201csome races are smarter than others because of genetics,\u201d there<i>&nbsp;</i>is<i>&nbsp;</i>data to suggest the variability hypothesis may be true in some places and for certain kinds of intelligence, though this hypothesis has often been leveraged in sexist ways.</p><p>If many EAs buy into the variability hypothesis, then when I am in the EA spaces I run in\u2014which are full of men who graduated from elite universities\u2014some may assume I am less smart than they are not just because they are smart, but also&nbsp;<i>because I am a woman</i>. For instance, if they\u2019re at the 97th percentile of intelligence, rather than assuming there\u2019s a 3% chance any given person is as smart as they are, many will employ higher priors for men than for women.&nbsp;</p><p>Women become attuned to which men are employing what priors about their intelligence because it matters when deciding who to befriend, date, collaborate with, be mentored by, and so on. It feels different to talk to a man who is open to the possibility that you\u2019re as smart as he is and one who has all but ruled this out. (Imagine asking your parent for something as a kid\u2014you could generally tell the difference between a \u201cno\u201d where the door wasn\u2019t totally shut, and one where it was.)</p><p>I have had my intelligence underestimated both within and outside of EA. But three things make intelligence-related sexism particularly insidious within EA. First, EA is heavily male. As a result, I am more likely to experience sexism in EA spaces than in environments where women are better represented. Second, the discourse around Bostrom\u2019s email has convinced me that it is more socially acceptable within EA to harbor certain racist or sexist beliefs (as compared to, e.g., academia), so EAs who do may not work very hard to think\u2014or act\u2014differently. Finally, many EAs place a high premium on certain, narrowly defined forms of intelligence. In other spaces, while I might at least benefit from men thinking: \u201cI\u2019m smarter than you, but you probably bring other important stuff to the table,\u201d in EA spaces, it often feels more like: \u201cI\u2019m smarter than you, and that\u2019s primarily what matters.\u201d</p><p>If something causes me to leave EA entirely, it may well be sexism. I simply don\u2019t have to do as much extra work to prove myself in other spaces (including ones where people are every bit as smart), and having to do this work saps me of my energy, confidence, and time; in short, of my ability to be an effective altruist.</p>", "user": {"username": "hobbes"}}, {"_id": "4DokGvufefa4EfWTH", "title": "Is the road to hell really paved with good intentions?", "postedAt": "2023-01-13T13:47:15.420Z", "htmlBody": "<p>There's a quote running around the internet that basically states that the road to hell is paved with good intentions.</p>\n<p>Is this really true in real life, IE does a large share of negative impact come from good intentions?</p>\n<p>And if this is correct, why does this happen?</p>\n", "user": {"username": "Sharmake"}}, {"_id": "JcaecPXE8am7MYJXZ", "title": "I am tired.", "postedAt": "2023-01-12T22:17:43.016Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Hello!

I have almost never posted here on the forum about even straightforward things. And debating race and IQ is something I find exceptionally emotionally tough. So I don't plan to participate in any extensive debates in the comments, hope that you understand why.</p><h1>My thoughts</h1><p>In my view, Bostrom's email would have been offensive in the 90s and it is offensive now, for good reason. His apology fails badly to fully take responsibility or display an understanding of the harm the views expressed represent.</p><p>I think that being deliberately offensive to make a point is gross. When people in positions of privilege use or mention slurs lightly they are able to do so because they are blinkered to the lived experience of others and disengaged from empathy with those different to them.</p><p>Note that I\u2019m not generally in the business of picking people apart for small one-off past infractions. But I do think it would be virtuous to apologise for and to truly take responsibility for one\u2019s past actions.&nbsp;</p><p>Bostrom\u2019s apology is defensively couched - emphasising the age of the email, what others wrote on the listserv, that it would be best forgotten, that fear that people might smear him. I think that is cowardly and shows a disappointing lack of ownership of his actions.</p><p>But I don\u2019t just care about the inclusion of a slur in the email. I am deeply uncomfortable with a discussion of race and intelligence failing to acknowledge the historical context of the ideas\u2019 origin and the harm they can and have caused.</p><p>To be clear, I think the view Bostrom expressed was wrong, and wrong in a harmful and reckless way.</p><p>When you argue a point like this without addressing the context of how those ideas came about you will likely be missing something important we should learn from history and be badly wrong.</p><p>When you are willfully disengaged from the empathy that underlies common decency you will have a massive blindspot in your reasoning and you will likely be badly wrong.</p><p>I do not think that there is only one acceptable way to express thoughts about this issue, nor do I think this issue could never be discussed sensitively. And I do think it is okay for people to sometimes say things online that I think are plain wrong.</p><p>But we all know that this issue is high stakes - ideas about racial superiority in the UK, America, and Germany led to some of the worst atrocities of the 20th century. And eugenists historically espoused utterly wrong views on race and intelligence wearing the guise of science.</p><p>There were c.60,000 sterilisations in US eugenics programmes - focused on women of colour.

Hypothetically, I am claiming that the more 'in-demand' a part of an animal is, the pricier, and thus the more one contributes to the price of raising an additional animal the more responsible one is for their suffering. Just like with the table above, I do not expect it to be anything close to a 1:1 ratio (oh this is twice as expensive, twice as bad!), since everything seems pretty inelastic. But I defer to the fact that maybe some price differences can be different by more than a factor of 2x, and will explore the potential differences below. I also doubt the impact of something like this (a few people working in the animal welfare space I spoke with have expressed such doubts), and well, yeah, it is a marginal consideration. But marginal reducetarianism could also be pretty simple to sometimes consider (just defer to the price of one meat meal vs another of the same animal) and it could apply to a good part of the general population and even the EA community too.</p><p>Anyway, maybe consider this an appeal to cunningham's law and an effort to engage with the community and just write.<br>&nbsp;</p><h3>Question:</h3><p>An absurd question from the perspective of animal welfare (\"just don't partake at all\"): Are there certain parts of an animal that are worse to consume, for animal welfare, than other parts? And if so, which ones are the worst, by how much, and how can we measure this?&nbsp;<i>Within diets of meat consumption, how can we optimize further for animal welfare? How can we marginally improve reducetarianism?</i></p><p>AKA some of the situations that made me think about this: Which is the worse meal, chicken wings or chicken breast? I have an intuition that a meal that takes 8-10 wings is probably worse than a similarly portioned meal of a single breast<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref02thn72gio07\"><sup><a href=\"#fn02thn72gio07\">[1]</a></sup></span>. What is the worst cut of beef to consume from an ethical perspective (what leads most to an additional cow, if we are voting with our money, that is)? I also have an intuition that filet mignon is a lot worse to purchase than ground beef which might be more of a 'less desirable product' (Saying 'byproduct' is probably pretty inaccurate since apparently every part of an animal slaughtered gets used pretty efficiently). How much less vegan is a meal cooked with some amount of fish sauce compared to one primarily considered fish or without any animal product at all?</p><p>What leads to marginally more demand for an additional animal to be produced and slaughtered?</p><p>I think as someone who is a 'reducetarian', I may have been too binary in my consideration of what is a \u2018meat meal\u2019, all while recognizing that this question is absurd and probably quite small impact-wise. So here's what I found to be the extent of these differences.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Answer (Attempt):</h3><p><strong>Main Question: If I am going to eat a meat meal, what animal products contribute most to animal suffering, as defined by which animal products, with a marginal increase of demand (your purchase of animal product), lead to the greatest marginal increase of supply (animals factory farmed)?</strong><br>&nbsp;</p><p>I am assuming that the demand here can be reflected as a proxy of price, a useful quantification for comparison. A higher price/meal is in higher demand, many things being equal (trying to control for quality by doing same-brand same-quality-meat comparisons, at a market value (not in a restaurant where additional costs like prep and sides confound) and control for quantity by adjusting all prices to what a 'meal' would consist of as opposed to just going by price/lb. when certain cuts contain bones (also note that what consists of a serving could be important, e.g. I am assuming you are more likely to eat the amount you are served, imagine a 5 oz. filet mignon serving versus a 12 oz. NY Strip sitting on someone's plate)).</p><p>I set about trying to make all things equal by comparing the costs of different cuts of meat from the same brand on the costco wholesale grocery <a href=\"https://www.costco.com/meat.html\">site</a>. <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MP0ezh3so49sa63p_XG3XbO2IiHj9kw52nf-nmhQIGg/edit?usp=sharing\">Here</a> is my summary of this Costco data, which I tried my best to make a price/meal comparison (it appears Costco has removed some options from their site or perhaps they are location specific, oops).

I tried my best but there is a range of eaters and averages are hard. It could be that price/lb. works just fine, and it seems to for the most part but I do have a couple intuitions that made me want to try price/meal:<ul><li>People are more likely to eat a 'serving', which often depends on how a piece of meat is cut and served.</li><li>Bone-in (particularly this for using weight), whether the meat is a main or side dish, and the loss of moisture/fat in cooking are also things to consider.</li></ul></li><li>Here are some differences I noted with regard to my initial questions.&nbsp;<ul><li>The most extreme difference at Costco, the sirloin steak or burgers versus the tomahawk or cowboy steaks, differed by a factor range of 2x-8x depending on portion size. The USDA sheet demonstrates a similar difference.</li><li>Wings/thighs do seem to be twice as costly per meal as breasts/tenderloins, though again I do not mean to say they are necessarily twice as bad and I also am suspicious of my own meal portion sizing here.</li></ul></li><li>Most of the 'price/meals' seem comparable enough to not merit too much attention, though there do seem to be outliers like larger and more sought after cuts of beef in particular that range above a 2-3x difference. Where on <a href=\"https://www.mosiersiga.com/butcher-shop-prices\">this butcher site</a>, there is a max difference of ~5x: Boneless Beef Tenderloin Filet $15.99/lb. vs Fresh Ground Beef (73% Lean) $2.89/lb. (5# package - $2.39/lb.)</li><li>Perhaps the most signficant 'marginal reducetarian' action someone can take beyond not eating a meal is to just eat the suggested portion size (3-4oz.), as opposed to committing to some whole steaks which can double or even quadruple the amount.</li><li>One policy I am leaning toward here is that in general when it comes to meat in addition to reducing meat consumption you can also try to spend as little as possible, and this may check out for other animals that I have explored as well like some fish (e.g. fatty tuna vs lean tuna).</li></ul><p>The idea that some cuts of meat are marginally worse than others from other animals should be considered for more extreme cases, though there do not seem to be many good applications. And at this point I think I have sort of proven to myself this was probably not worthwhile to look into. But anyway, an easy use case for this seems to be just avoiding the most expensive and sought after cuts of certain animals, namely beef, since hypothetically one could effectively be contributing 2+ meat meals in a single meal. Not to mention just reducing portion sizes, or even just reducing your meat consumption by a meal at a time per week or something along those lines. I might suggest a small heuristic that if one cut of meat is much more expensive relative to a cut of meat from the same animal, it should be avoided, though yeah just avoiding it altogether would be ideal.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Further Considerations&nbsp;</h3><p>(I am just going to just footnote these, main post done):</p><p><strong>Why is this relevant, to who?</strong>&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefou7on0yu3k\"><sup><a href=\"#fnou7on0yu3k\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p><strong>This relevancy and a small info hazard.</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2m4uuvqcmne\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2m4uuvqcmne\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p><strong>Modifiers on consumption.</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefara3mf5uxul\"><sup><a href=\"#fnara3mf5uxul\">[4]</a></sup></span></p><p><strong>Meta EA:</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9mql0bshnc\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9mql0bshnc\">[5]</a></sup></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn02thn72gio07\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref02thn72gio07\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Yeah, here begin the difficulties in measuring what a 'meal' is across different parts of an animal.

It demonstrated action, when so many college students were asking us, \"But what good are you guys actually doing right now?\" Rather than just being able to answer abstractly of some impact in a future career, or of spreading the movement (talk about pyramid schemey), I could also cite trying to reduce my own and other's meat consumption on campus.

Some initial thoughts:</p><ul><li><strong>We were surprised and impressed by the strength of the applications we received.</strong> When we launched the Challenge, we weren\u2019t sure we\u2019d be able to allocate all of the funding while staying above <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/technical-updates-to-our-global-health-and-wellbeing-cause-prioritization-framework/\"><u>our bar</u></a>. That bar went up ~50% over the course of the year, largely because of <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/update-on-our-planned-allocation-to-givewells-recommended-charities-in-2022/\"><u>the decline in our available assets</u></a>, but we believe all awardees were able to clear this new higher bar.</li><li><strong>Structuring the Challenge as an open call sourced a larger and broader set of high-impact programs than we anticipated.</strong> We we received expressions of interest in roughly even proportions across our three focus areas (climate, economic development, and health). None of the programs we ended up funding were among those we thought we were most likely to receive grants when we began the process. Additionally, we had anticipated most likely regranting to 1-3 programs, but found more exceptional programs than we expected.<ul><li>That said, we know that many applicants, including those we didn\u2019t ultimately select, spent a significant amount of time on the Challenge, which is a real cost. Now that we\u2019ve announced our decisions, we plan to survey all applicants about the process to learn more about the scale of those costs and how to improve any similar processes we run in the future.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Declining marginal returns are real, even with the most effective programs.</strong> We thought that many applicants had stellar average returns. However, in many of those cases, we were less sold on the value of further funding on the margin.</li><li><strong>There were many foundations that did not meet our eligibility criteria, but that we would have been excited to evaluate.</strong> For practical reasons, we constrained participation to programs that had undertaken more than $10 million in grantmaking per year for at least the last three years. At the beginning of this process, we received numerous applications from promising programs that did not meet that criterion. We aren\u2019t yet sure whether we\u2019ll repeat the Regranting Challenge, but if we do, one avenue we would be excited to explore is expansion to smaller organizations.</li></ul><p>We hope that our check-ins with awardees over the coming months and years will help us learn about the impact of this funding.

For an introduction to the area, I have written a brief summary below.&nbsp; In this post, I will extend that work, diving deeper into the literature and the landscape of organisations in the field, as well as creating a cost-effectiveness model for some of the most promising preventative interventions. Based on this, I will offer some concrete recommendations that different stakeholders should take - from individuals looking to donate, to funders, to charity evaluators and incubators.</p><p>The key recommendations I make, in order of importance, are:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Support community-based interventions that seek to \u200b\u200bshift harmful gender norms and reduce violence- they have a high quality of evidence, and cost $180/DALY (disability adjusted life years) or $150 for a woman to live a year free from violence.

It is one of the leading burdens of disease globally, responsible for 8.5 million DALYs and 68 500 deaths annually.&nbsp;</li><li>In several countries, violence against women is in the top 3-5 leading causes of death for young women aged between 15 and 29 (<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0886260517753851\"><u>Mendoza et al 2018</u></a>).</li><li>VAWG has wide-ranging effects on women\u2019s physical, sexual and mental health- in fact, it is responsible for 11% of the DALY burden of depressive disorders and 14% of the DALY burden of HIV in women (<a href=\"https://www.healthdata.org/results/gbd_summaries/2019/intimate-partner-violence-level-2-risk\"><u>IHME 2019</u></a>)</li><li>Globally, the rates of VAWG are both alarmingly high and have increased over the last 30 years, despite gains in other areas of women\u2019s health, such as maternal care (<a href=\"https://www.thinkglobalhealth.org/article/violence-against-women\"><u>Think Global Health</u></a>).</li><li>In 2016, the global economic cost of violence against women was estimated by the UN to be US$1.5 trillion, equivalent to approximately 2% of the global GDP (<a href=\"https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2016/9/speech-by-lakshmi-puri-on-economic-costs-of-violence-against-women\"><u>UN Women 2016</u></a>).</li><li>Although there are many groups working to stop VAWG, it is fairly neglected relative to the scale of harm that it causes (<a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(14)61703-7.pdf\"><u>Ellsberg et al 2015</u></a>). In addition, a lot of work may not be prioritising interventions that have the greatest impact (<a href=\"https://www.whatworks.co.za/documents/publications/374-evidence-reviewfweb/file\"><u>What Works, 2019</u></a>).</li><li>Please see my&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/majcwf7i8pW8eMJ3v/new-cause-area-violence-against-women-and-girls\"><u>original post</u></a> for more details</li></ul><h2>Summary of interventions</h2><p>In my initial post, I argued that interventions that seek to prevent violence from occurring in the first place are the most likely to be cost-effective (as opposed to interventions that support women who have already experienced violence or which treat the effects of violence, which undoubtedly are also very important).&nbsp; Here, I evaluate some of the most promising types of primary prevention interventions for VAWG<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefo41sb29p6us\"><sup><a href=\"#fno41sb29p6us\">[1]</a></sup></span>, evaluating them and establishing some concrete recommendations.&nbsp;</p><p>The main metrics that were considered were the quality of evidence for the intervention (a subjective assessment based on a non-exhaustive literature search), and the cost-effectiveness, which is reported in both cost per disability adjusted life year (DALY)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefl9mtxt8n52e\"><sup><a href=\"#fnl9mtxt8n52e\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and cost&nbsp; for a woman to live a year free from violence.

It should be noted that the estimates of the cost for a woman to live a year free from violence is directly taken from the literature on the benefits and costs of interventions, whilst the estimates for cost/DALY are based on a more speculative model of the economic and health harms of IPV.</p><p>&nbsp;Of course, these cost-effectiveness calculations cannot capture many of the greatest harms of violence- its infringement on women\u2019s rights, and many of the broader societal level effects that violence against women and girls has.&nbsp; Despite this, these models are useful in comparing interventions in this field to other areas. In that light, and for reference, Givewell, a charity focused on recommending the most cost-effective global health charities, has a \u2018bar\u2019 of $125/DALY to consider and potentially recommend charities.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673530244/mirroredImages/uH9akQzJkzpBD5Duw/ep8xovkayspiu7hguswv.png\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673530245/mirroredImages/uH9akQzJkzpBD5Duw/nehlwtevek24nyilmouy.png 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673530245/mirroredImages/uH9akQzJkzpBD5Duw/wbvtkcbeerfqbmjo1wp1.png 200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673530245/mirroredImages/uH9akQzJkzpBD5Duw/sqbgff3h5umttarwxyk7.png 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673530245/mirroredImages/uH9akQzJkzpBD5Duw/foovmm7iszslrtxa1udy.png 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673530245/mirroredImages/uH9akQzJkzpBD5Duw/xaqfgxz5u4kpajkngpqq.png 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673530244/mirroredImages/uH9akQzJkzpBD5Duw/zsf3qxgw41busck52vvd.png 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673530245/mirroredImages/uH9akQzJkzpBD5Duw/p4o6qorz4ggmvzs6omev.png 700w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673530244/mirroredImages/uH9akQzJkzpBD5Duw/fsk8t9esf57rgcnf0mdr.png 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673530244/mirroredImages/uH9akQzJkzpBD5Duw/o9zbbigqplojp44sqfnp.png 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673530245/mirroredImages/uH9akQzJkzpBD5Duw/pvwrzestgjohrelfxdvf.png 984w\"><br>&nbsp;</p><p>For in-depth detail on how the cost-effectiveness analysis model was created, please see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1dhUykXzKEiuHz_w1IrG6KaZoACfFBiEQ6j1IaIr6mY4/edit#heading=h.5sdxn3fo66xw\"><u>Supplementary Material 1</u></a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Details by interventions</h2><h3>Community activist social empowerment</h3><p>Social empowerment programs to reduce VAWG broadly aim to shift harmful attitudes, roles and social norms in relation to VAWG. This encompassess programs in many different settings (e.g. workshops at schools, hospitals, in the community)&nbsp; with different content (e.g. didactic, self-determined) and of differing lengths (e.g. one-off sessions, 6 month programs, longer interventions)</p><p>One of the most promising types of social empowerment interventions&nbsp; is&nbsp;<strong>community-level activist programs.</strong> This approach is built on the premise that community-led and community-level work can enable sustained change on VAWG prevention at a population level (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25467577/\"><u>Michau et al, 2015</u></a>). These programs are characteristically:</p><ul><li>Based in the community, rather than a specific setting like a school or hospital&nbsp;</li><li>Train and utilise&nbsp;<strong>local community members who act as activists</strong>, rather than didactic instructors \u2013 Community activists are supported by manuals and other materials to enable structured or guided engagement with men and women in their community</li><li>Involves community activists increasing local knowledge about VAWG and positively changing social and gender norms, directly supporting survivors or engaging couples with known problems with IPV, providing counselling and support to couples. They often work with local religious and traditional leaders and state actors, such as the police, health and social services, to strengthen their responses to survivors and influence their attitudes and practices in their work.&nbsp;</li><li>Are carried out over a medium to long-term time frame (loosely defined as more than 12 month program duration).</li></ul><p>Although many other program types were identified, they were ultimately not thoroughly investigated in this report as it seemed unlikely that they would be as promising as community activist programs, which have the strongest evidence base and effect size.&nbsp;</p><p>A non-exhaustive literature search of all social empowerment programs was conducted, through which community activist programs were selected for. (the details of all programs identified, their results, and their reason for inclusion exclusion from this analysis, can be found&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/127d6oxOh3sOpoKunvVDxd-0tnh4NRVsPw6LsrbU4XpU/edit#gid=706984482\"><u>here</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>From this, there are several studies evaluating community activist social empowerment programs-&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bmcmedicine.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12916-014-0122-5\"><u>Abramsky et al (2014)</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33355268/\"><u>Dunkle et al (2020)</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/11/3/e042365#ref-22\"><u>Leight et al (2020)</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4370228/#R18\"><u>Wagman et al (2015)</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7006731/\"><u>Ogum Alangea et al (2020)</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bmcinthealthhumrights.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12914-020-00246-8\"><u>Le Roux et al (2020)</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7125418/\"><u>Chatterji et al (2020)</u></a>. They differ in the specific community activist model they used, including SASA!,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefshutzmwzwyj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnshutzmwzwyj\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Unite for a Better Life (UBL),<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvyi61hr2xch\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvyi61hr2xch\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and rural response systems (RRS).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefx4gxi2ogxrk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnx4gxi2ogxrk\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Based on these studies , community activist based programs have an established evidence base, and do lead to significant reductions in violence. In estimating the cost-effectiveness of this intervention,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref949hb6vsjt6\"><sup><a href=\"#fn949hb6vsjt6\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;<strong>community activist based social empowerment programs were found to have a cost-effectiveness of $180/DALY, or $150 for a woman to live a year free from violence.</strong></p><p>In addition to the strong evidence base and cost-effectiveness of the intervention, it also appears that the intervention is relatively scaleable. In particular, SASA! has created an activist kit, and works with regional partners and NGOs to implement the program; two particularly promising organisations,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cedovip.org/sasa/sasa-in-action/\"><u>CEDOVIP</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://raisingvoices.org/about-us/approach/\"><u>Raising Voices</u></a>, are providing technical assistance to other NGOs and governments and themselves scaling up SASA! programs (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13552074.2019.1615290?journalCode=cgde20\"><u>Namy et al 2019</u></a>). They seem particularly promising organisations to support.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4ehs6jklpb2\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4ehs6jklpb2\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>In conjunction with supporting existing organisations in scaling up community activist programs, and given the relative dearth of organisations using this approach, it also seems prudent to found new charities in the area. Given that in any given year, approximately 200 million women are affected by violence, it is almost certainly the case that the amount of organisations working in the space is neglected. A brief geographic assessment of particularly neglected and tractbale geographies where new organisations was carried out (more details on the methodology and the results can be found in Supplementary Material 2); based on this, it seems like particularly promising areas to start new charities might include:</p><ul><li><strong>Central/southern Africa-</strong> Zambia, Angola, Zimbabwe, Tanzania and Botswana</li><li><strong>Asia Pacific region</strong>- East Timor, Fiji, Papua New Guinea</li><li><strong>Asia</strong>- India</li><li><strong>Other-</strong> Kuwait</li></ul><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>Recommendations</strong>:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Support&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cedovip.org/sasa/sasa-in-action/\"><u>CEDOVIP</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://raisingvoices.org/about-us/approach/\"><u>Raising Voices</u></a> are providing technical assistance to other NGOs and governments and themselves scaling up community based social programs based on the well-evidenced SASA!</li><li>Found new charities focused on community-based interventions that seek to \u200b\u200bshift harmful gender norms and reduce violence, particularly in neglected geographies and populations</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h3>Self-defence programs</h3><p>Another common intervention is self-defence programs, most of which are based on the evidence-based IMPower program.

They are most commonly targeted towards school-aged girls (and often boys as well).</p><p>There are several cohort studies and RCTs of IMPower -&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23727500/\"><u>Sinclair et al (2013)</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24733880/\"><u>Sarnquist et al (2014)</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5326602/\"><u>Baiocchi et al (2017)</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-018-6220-0\"><u>Decker et al 2018</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10538712.2020.1847229?journalCode=wcsa20\"><u>Edwards et al 2020</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmsa1411131\"><u>Senn et al (2013)</u></a>-&nbsp; from which the estimate of the effectiveness of the intervention were derived, as well as several other studies for the persistence of the effects-&nbsp; <a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0361684317690119\"><u>Senn et al 2017</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1077801214526046?journalCode=vawa\"><u>Hollander et al 2014</u></a>. Although more details on these are described in the cost-effectiveness model, it seems that these programs may&nbsp; reduce the prevalence of violence by approximately 45%, with an annual effect persistence of 20-30%. However, moderate to high risk of bias in the included studies, possible methodological flaws in the way questions were asked, as well as my priors led me to discount the effectiveness of this intervention slightly more than other interventions.</p><p><strong>In the model, self-defence programs have a cost-effectiveness of approximately $260/DALY, or $215 for a woman to live a year free from violence.</strong> This is reasonably cost-effective, but perhaps not as cost-effective compared to some of the interventions that are presented in this report. However, one comparative advantage is that there seem to be NGOs with a&nbsp;<strong>proven track record that could scale&nbsp;</strong>IMPower programs. Such NGOs include&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nomeansnoworldwide.org/\"><u>No Means No Worldwide</u></a> (NMNW),<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwkzqwzwiajr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwkzqwzwiajr\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;which has reached over 2 million school aged children in 2021 and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ujamaa-africa.org/\"><u>Ujamaa</u></a>, which has significantly scaled up in schools in Kenya. Although I did not conduct a comprehensive literature search, it seems that there are a number of other organisations who also teach self-defence, some of which use IMPower; however, there was less data on them, and a lot of them appear to be local or opportunistic, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.unhcr.org/uk/news/stories/2017/12/5a2a4c1c4/defence-class-teaches-refugee-women-fight-gender-violence.html\"><u>this self-defence program in a refugee camp</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://redbrigade-lucknow.org/\"><u>this organisation</u></a> in Lucknow, India.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Recommendation:</strong> Self-defence programs are a moderately cost-effective and potentially scalable intervention.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nomeansnoworldwide.org/\"><u>No Means No Worldwide</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ujamaa-africa.org/\"><u>Ujamaa</u></a> appear to be two organisations operating well at scale.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h3>Mass media campaigns</h3><p>Mass media campaigns are a promising intervention carried out by governments and organisations around the world to effect behavioural and attitudinal change.

I focused on studies aiming to prevent violence from occurring.&nbsp;</p><p>I conducted a non-exhaustive search of the literature in this area; studies vary in the media format and their target audience (<a href=\"https://mittalsouthasiainstitute.harvard.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/Masculinity-matters-Using-entertainment-education-to-engage-men-in-ending-violence-against-women-in-India.pdf\"><u>Lapsansky and Chaterjee 2013</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://search.informit.org/doi/epdf/10.3316/ielapa.458918116922363\"><u>Paterson et al 2000</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/political-science-research-and-methods/article/how-does-media-influence-social-norms-experimental-evidence-on-the-role-of-common-knowledge/23D65E06CAB2876B08F12E23CD5C0539\"><u>Arias 2018</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pdxscholar.library.pdx.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1026&amp;context=comm_fac\"><u>Khosla et al 2013</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/working-with-media-to-prevent-violence-against-women-the-uncovere\"><u>Simons and Khan 2019</u></a>). Indeed, one observational, correlative study even found that the introduction of cable television in India reduced the acceptability and rate of VAWG (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/qje/article-abstract/124/3/1057/1905111\"><u>Jensen and Oster 2009</u></a>). It seems like the most cost-effective is likely to be&nbsp;<strong>serialised drama radio programs targeting both women and men,</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4z85t43mp1f\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4z85t43mp1f\">[10]</a></sup></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong>on which there is one RCT&nbsp;<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0010414020912275\"><u>Green et al (2020)</u></a>. This study found a significant increase in willingness of women to seek help in the event of IPV, and a 25% relative reduction in rates of violence experience (as reported by women). This study seems significantly higher than studies in other mass media campaigns for sexual behaviour and cohort studies in the space (<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10810730490271548\"><u>Synder et al (2004)</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10896-016-9837-8\"><u>Jesmin and Amin (2017)</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8886917_Preventing_Domestic_Violence_in_the_African_American_Community_Assessing_the_Impact_of_a_Dramatic_Radio_Serial\"><u>Wray et al (2004)</u></a>), which generally show a relative reduction of 3-5%.</p><p>In estimating the cost-effectiveness of this intervention, a relatively conservative estimate of a 7% relative reduction and moderately strong discounts for internal and external validity were applied. In spite of this, mass media campaigns appear to be a&nbsp;<strong>very cost-effective intervention, with a cost/DALY of $13 or $11 for a woman to live a year free from violence.</strong></p><p>There are a few important caveats that I want to mention here:</p><ul><li>The evidence base here is less strong than for other interventions</li><li>The type and implementation of the mass media campaign is likely to be fairly instrumental in its acceptability and impact (<a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.2989/16085906.2021.1872666\"><u>Walker 2021</u></a>)</li><li>Although one of the appeals of mass media campaigns is their scalability, I feel less confident, due to social and cultural differences in the circumstances within which violence occurs and the political attitudes towards gender roles, that the same type of media campaigns in one setting&nbsp; would work in another (as opposed to mass media campaigns for typical global health interventions, like vitamin supplementation or vaccinations). However, I I think to a large extent,&nbsp; appropriate co-design of campaigns with local stakeholders (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27813210/\"><u>Stanley et al 2017</u></a>), including script writing of the media, could mitigate this to a significant extent</li></ul><p>Overall, and as discussed above, mass media campaigns&nbsp;<i>could</i> be a promising intervention in reducing VAWG; however, there is insufficient evidence at this time to understand how much effect it has, and how persistent its effects are. I would recommend funding an experimental study, ideally a cluster randomised RCT, which investigated the effects of&nbsp; a drama-style radio campaign on the incidence of violence against women and girls. Ideally, the study would have a relatively large sample size and have a follow up duration of at least 24 months. This study could be undertaken by an organisation that is already carrying out mass media campaigns, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.familyempowermentmedia.org/\"><u>Family Empowerment Media</u></a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.developmentmedia.net/\"><u>Development Media International</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>It is relevant to note that Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA) are currently running an RCT of a radio campaign in Tanzania with Uzikwasa (<a href=\"https://www.poverty-action.org/study/mass-media-experiments-reduce-violence-against-women-tanzania\"><u>details here</u></a>), but on balance it seems like more evidence here would be quite useful in determining the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of this intervention.&nbsp; However, it does also seem plausible that&nbsp; the value of an RCT might be relatively low (especially given their high cost and the difficulty of running a well designed mass media RCT), and that just directly funding an organisation to run mass media campaigns might be a reasonable option.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Recommendation</strong>: Mass media campaigns may be a highly cost-effective intervention for VAWG, but at this time, there is insufficient evidence to be confident about their impact.

Quantify the impact of interventions to reduce VAWG</strong></p><p>The outcomes measured in studies and organisations working on VAWG differ significantly; however, in most of the literature, intervention outcomes are reported in terms of prevalence of years free from intimate partner violence (IPV). As a result, the first step was to quantify the health and economic benefits of a year free from IPV, such that the impact of interventions in this space could be cross-compatible with other cause areas and interventions. This quantification is inherently a difficult task that will reduce the harms of VAWG; despite this, it is important that such calculations are attempted to be able to compare interventions in this area to other global health interventions. However, we should certainly take these estimates with a grain of salt, and with an acknowledgement that they don't capture a lot of the nuances and&nbsp; complexities of this area.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on the quality of evidence, and particularly causal evidence, I looked at the health and income effects of VAWG.&nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>Health impact</strong><br>For the health impact (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/127d6oxOh3sOpoKunvVDxd-0tnh4NRVsPw6LsrbU4XpU/edit#gid=902914931\"><u>see this sheet</u></a>) I used three different approaches to estimate the DALY-burden per woman affected by a year of IPV. I then gave a weighted average of these three estimates, giving more weight to estimates I thought were more accurate. Below are the respective methods and reasons behind the weights:</p><ol><li><strong>IHME Data&nbsp;</strong><ol><li><strong>Description:&nbsp;</strong>The IHME data on the prevalence and DALY burden of IPV was used to estimate the burden/individual per year affected by IPV. The data source only included the relative risk of anxiety and depression, interpersonal/physical violence and HIV in its calculation of the DALY burden of IPV, and my prior was that it would therefore be a very low approximation of the burden of IPV</li><li>Estimates 0.06 DALYs per year of IPV.&nbsp;</li><li>I assigned a weighting of 40% to this because, although it is likely to be an underestimate, it is from a highly reputed source.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Ferrari et al 2022 estimate</strong><ol><li>Description: Estimate from recent economic evaluation study of different IPV interventions</li><li>Estimates 1.60 DALYs per year of IPV</li><li>I assigned a weighting of 20% because the methods used to estimate this burden were not completely clear, and this method has not been validated.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Personal calculation of relative risks</strong><ol><li>Description: A personal calculation of the relative risk of different health conditions for women who have experienced IPV versus the general population. This was then used to generate an estimate of the total health, DALY burden attributable to IPV.</li><li>Estimates 1.13 DALYs per year of PIV&nbsp;</li><li>I assigned a weighting of&nbsp; of 40% to this because, although it seems the most comprehensive of the three approaches, it has not been validated.</li></ol></li></ol><p><i>These estimates showed significant variance of&nbsp; factor of 25, which suggests that any such estimate has a confidence interval of at least one order of magnitude. My impression is that there are a number of longer-term health outcomes and benefits that are not captured here, that an estimate closer to the personal calculation of relative risk or Ferrari et al 2022 estimate are most accurate.</i></p><p><br><strong>Economic impact</strong></p><p>For the economic impact (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/127d6oxOh3sOpoKunvVDxd-0tnh4NRVsPw6LsrbU4XpU/edit#gid=167086715\"><u>see this sheet</u></a>), the effects of IPV on productivity, workforce participation and healthcare and legal costs incurred were included. A conservative estimate assumed that these effects persisted for one year after women were affected by violence, and the economic harm in that second&nbsp; was half that of the first year. The<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/technical-updates-to-our-global-health-and-wellbeing-cause-prioritization-framework/\"><u> Open Philanthropy methodology and moral weights&nbsp;</u></a>to convert income effects to DALYs was then used.</p><p><i>These estimates, which are fairly conservative, are likely the lower bound of an estimate that has a one order of magnitude confidence interval. This is because these estimates take a conservative estimate of female earning and how much it might be impacted by violence, and&nbsp; modest estimate of long-term impact of violence.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Cost</strong></p><p>The third step was to estimate the cost; for this, estimates from NGOs or academic studies that had published cost data for that intervention type were used. If appropriate. Initially, a scaling adjustment was added in the event that it was anticipated that an intervention might become cheaper/more expensive as it scaled up.

It was meant as an environment that people could use to ramp up their ML skills. It turned out to be an interesting success. Here, I lay down what happened in more detail, in case you\u2019re curious or want to replicate it (or some aspects of it) in your group.</p><p>Initially, it started off as a selfish idea where I wanted to attend <a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/YgpDYjTx7DCEgziG5/apply-to-the-ml-for-alignment-bootcamp-mlab-in-berkeley-jan\">MLAB</a> by <a href=\"https://www.redwoodresearch.org/\">Redwood Research</a> but couldn\u2019t due to some visa reasons. Then I figured that I could just replicate the whole environment of the bootcamp in Finland instead of doing something just by myself in my room. This is how it started. Then I had some discussions with the EAs in my group and in Finland, and this seemed like a very good opportunity to try something we\u2019ve never done before, and also upskill AI-interested EAs in necessary skills - which is a visible bottleneck in our group. We have many people interested in AI Safety, but most of us seem to not have the skills necessary to get hired by the super-competitive AI-safety orgs right now.</p><p>We started with the conservative metric that if this bootcamp leads to any one of the participants starting to work in AI Safety in the next 1-1.5 years, we would consider this a success. Some ways in which the bootcamp was (partially) AI-safety focused were:</p><ul><li>AI-safety interested people had an edge in the selection process.</li><li>Quite a few of our informal discussions (lunch, breaks, etc) were centered around AI Safety and Risk</li><li>Day 4 was an AI Safety day with Joel Pyykk\u00f6 (an independent AI Safety researcher), where everyone had a primer on AI Risk and a discussion afterwards. The whole thing lasted almost 4 hours and was super cool!</li></ul><h2>Curriculum</h2><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rqyfQoQpFrY5_issKXuRY5IoOzOsjTWLOivZJBaT9zc/edit\">MLB Info Guide</a></p><h2>Flexibility Summary</h2><p>Flexibility in curriculum is good in the sense that people can pursue their own learning journeys and do what\u2019s best for them. Especially works for self-directed individuals. It\u2019s bad in the sense that in a peer-learning environment if people diverge too much in what they\u2019re doing it negatively affects the group and reduces interaction. I\u2019m not sure how to find the optimal balance here.</p><h2>Selectiveness Summary</h2><p>We used a selective and elite framing for our bootcamp to attract applicants. We advertised that we would only accept 4-6 participants, but received 16 applications and ultimately accepted 9. The approach seemed to work, as some participants were excited to be accepted.</p><h2>Intensiveness Summary</h2><p>Our program was designed to be intensive and ambitious<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqcwpdz5ikvj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqcwpdz5ikvj\">[1]</a></sup></span>, with participants attending regularly for 9 days and working for roughly 7 hours each day. This approach worked well for some people, providing the certainty that they would be focused on the topic for the duration of the program. However, it was difficult to sustain this level of intensity for 9 days, and in the future, we would still aim for high intensity but over a shorter period of time.</p><h2>Peer Learning Summary</h2><p>We initially chose peer-learning due to resource constraints, but it turned out to be a good choice. The participants had very different perspectives which led to very interesting discussions, which was one of the highlights of the program. I will definitely optimize more for this in the future, for example by cultivating a more friendly, open, and taking confusions and ideas seriously vibe. The flexibility of the curriculum and the variance in skills within the participants hindered this quite a bit, and I would take care to pay more attention to these two factors more to induce a better peer-learning environment.</p><h2>Misc notes</h2><p>Going outside during pomodoro breaks and doing some physical activity is really fun and useful. We had a tennis ball we would throw around, but anything works.</p><h2>Feedback from Participants</h2><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673511886/mirroredImages/j9nLvT5ej8mKc4fhi/bswtq4ujjjaul7wcdoll.png\" alt=\"Forms response chart.

Question title: . Number of responses: .\"></p><h3>What were the best bits? (participant responses)</h3><ul><li>having a dedicated time and space to work on a project (here increasing ML skills)</li><li>The best conversations, where everyone contributed and we were going hard at a problem and then emerged victorious with an answer (omg this could be facilitated with something like daily post-lunch hard random question, just nerdsnipe the group and watch the discussion unfold)</li><li>Conversations, throwing the tennis ball</li><li>(1) Setting public goals and reflecting on progress, (2) useful materials I hadn't noticed like the mathematical framework for transformers, (3) discussions often forced me to discover holes in my knowledge and patch them.</li><li>opportunity to learn in a social setting</li><li>Finishing the day feeling like you had done some work</li><li>Dedicated place and timing. Having breaks in between and physical activities, intellectual discussion in the breaks, guidance and motivation to work in ML. Working in our own pace without feeling any pressure.</li></ul><h3>What stuff could have been improved? (participant responses)</h3><ul><li>grouping up a little more, but this depends totaly on the attending people and their level of knowledge, so nothing the organizer could change</li><li>The classroom vibe felt a bit tense for me for some reason - also this place is far from my home - and a lot of the free convos, esp toward the end of the bootcamp, were too advanced for me to understand, so the convos got less useful for me.</li><li>Maybe giving a specific time to teach/give information about some tools.<br>I think the length and intensity targets of the bootcamp were at cross-purposes. It's hard to sustain a high level of intensity for 9 days. Either a shorter, more intense period like a hackathon weekend or a longer, less intense bootcamp might be easier to get buy-in for from participants. I didn't really find this a huge problem, though.</li><li>the 3 negative points above: 1) vegan snacks if possible. 2) a room with tables and bigger whiteboard. 3) although the flexibility in curriculum might be good, it also felt like people were doing different things most of the time so it wasn't much different from just learning by myself. Perhaps some structure could have made it more collaborative</li><li>I feel there was a bit too much freedom and distraction. It's an inherent problem in putting people at different stages in their learning journey in the same place, so we couldn't build enough momentum.</li></ul><h3>Free comments: Have something else to say that might be interesting? please take a minute to pause here before moving on. (This is probably the most important section in this form for me)</h3><ul><li>I was able to achieve my goal set for this bootcamp, which I am happy about. Although I am not totally satisfied with the algorithms I made, this is mainly because of the limited time I had. I really enjoyed the atmosphere in here, it helped me work and stay focused. Also it was nice to get to know all of you guys :)</li><li>Good job, great success :) Next time I think it's safe to have a bit simpler snacks. To have lunches covered is really nice. I hope you keep doing \"bootcamps\" or whatever cool projects you come up with that have positive overflow effects to other people. This is great. Also you should write a post about this experience, detailing how and why you did it, what kinds of results were there, and how other people can replicate.</li><li>Organization and the idea behind this bootcamp was good. Thanks for your efforts and friendly nature.</li><li>thank you for the bootcamp, it was great!</li><li>Could implement some Cal Newport\u2019s Deep Work ideas in the future.</li></ul><h2>Appendix</h2><h3>Personal</h3><p>Personally, I was super skeptical of this being a success. I had mentally prepared myself for maybe getting 1-2 more participants, but everyone dropping out except me by the end. And then I was organizing this on the motivation that I would have to be the 1 person to starts working in AI Safety soon, for the bootcamp to be a success. This is a very weird rationalization - I get it - but it helped me go ahead with it.</p><h3><br>Selectiveness Babble</h3><p>Numbers</p><ul><li>Applicants<ul><li>Google form: 13</li><li>Direct Contact: 3</li></ul></li><li>Accepted: 9 total</li><li>Attended: 8</li><li>Finished: 5</li></ul><p>It generally gets quite hard to get people to sign up for an event, more so if you require a lot of time and effort from them. In this bootcamp, I was basically asking people to commit two weeks of full-time work to it. So the potential applicant set was already pretty small. We tried out some strategies to help us get more people. I think they worked well, but maybe the counterfactual would\u2019ve been the same. I can\u2019t think of a low-cost way to judge. We projected the bootcamp as a highly selective and elite program, asking a lot from the participants (instead of the opposite framing of us being the one in need which we generally follow), where you would feel hyped if you were accepted. I picked this approach from the Ivy league in general, and <a href=\"https://www.slush.org/events/helsinki/volunteers/\">Slush</a> in finland for example. It seems to have worked well. We advertised we would accept4-6 individuals, got 16 applications, and ended up getting 9 participants in total.&nbsp;<br>I went with 9 participants, even though I\u2019d mentioned I would take 4-6 because I realized that I could handle more, and the 4-6 was a more conservative number I came up with because I wasn\u2019t sure we would even get that many people. Some participants, upon receiving the acceptance, were super hyped - which felt kinda surprising and nice.</p><h3><br>Peer Learning Babble</h3><p>The initial reason for choosing peer-learning instead of \u201cteaching\u201d was resource constraints, but it turned out to be a good choice. Especially during the early half, when most participants were working on similar stuff. Many participants were approaching the concepts from very different angles, and the discussions we had would sometimes turn super intense, lead even the more experienced participants to notice flaws or gaps in their understanding, have multiple people figuring out together what exactly goes on in a neural network, and overall were one of the best parts of the bootcamp. I personally learned a lot more than I would have in a more passive or personal environment.</p><p>I am happy with the peer-learning outcomes, and would spend much more effort in the future on how to facilitate the environment better to further cultivate this.&nbsp;<br>Trying to cultivate a friendly and welcoming atmosphere, and explicitly reducing the barrier to ask and answer questions, for example by personally doing it or encouraging people when they do it, are some things to focus on. It also helps to have people thinking about roughly similar concepts at the same time.</p><p>I think having a couple more experienced people in the group to help think through things is very useful. It also strongly matters how similar the skills are of the people in the group, and the similarly of the projects they\u2019re working on during the bootcamp. Regarding skills, I noticed it\u2019s useful to have some kind of a lower bound (= you need to be at least this good), but having an uncapped upper bound is ideal and leads to interesting discussions. Regarding similarity of projects, people did like flexibility in what they could work on but it did strongly affect the peer-learning aspect and there\u2019s definitely a tradeoff here.&nbsp;</p><h3>Intensiveness Babble</h3><p>The program, inspired from MLAB, was designed to be intensive in nature. The participants were expected to attend regularly for 9 days, with roughly 7 hours of co-working each day. The simple idea behind this was to create an ambitious environment for everyone to get shit done. Check 42\u2019s piscine. Naturally, there were both pros and cons to this approach.</p><p>The full-time approach worked really well for some people, providing the certainty that this is what they\u2019re gonna be doing for the next 9 days - helping them focus in on the topic. This mindset did feel hard to sustain though as time went by, and that was the biggest con. In the future, I would still keep the intensity high but constrain it to fewer days. Sprints are incredible, but hard to sustain for long.</p><h2>Babbling daily reflection (1st half of bootcamp only)</h2><p><u>Day 1 Tue</u><br>The bootcamp started off super badly, with only 2 people arriving on time. It was super awkward to start the program with just those two, and maintain a positive environment until the rest arrived (1-2 hours later). Apparently, I found out that 10am is still too early morning for most students.</p><p>Once a few more people did arrive though, the day ended up pretty well. We started working on the curriculum. Also had a really good lunch discussion which one person was fomoing about because he didn\u2019t get to attend the discussion. We had multiple really good discussions during the day as well. Most notably on backprop.</p><p>The end-of-day ref<br>We decided to implement pomodoros,&nbsp;<br>Also pair coding. But I\u2019m very unsure how to go about this so I didn\u2019t end up doing this.<br>Didn\u2019t have rest in between working. And participants ended up overworking and feeling exhausted. Pomodoros will solve.<br>The general vibe was that it was a fun environment and productive environment to work in.</p><p><u>Day 2 Wed</u><br>Walking to the lunch place was a nice break.<br>Again got a rec for pair coding but didn\u2019t implement it.<br>We had breaks but stayed indoors. Should go outside</p><p><u>Day 3 Thu</u><br>I feel like we have this organic dynamic where the morning starts super slow, and then we get more and more into it as every hour passes.</p><p><u>Day 5 Mon</u><br>Rest breaks so much more fun. Thanks to the ball!

Beyond the content of the email, the apology is also terribly written, and reads like Nick, an intellectual leader in EA and longtermism, might still hold these views today to some degree. It also reads like Nick is primarily just trying to do damage control for using a racial slur, or preemptive PR work for some other reason, as opposed to focusing on the harms he may be contributing to, and the folks he is apologizing to. In this context, this also sounds like a dog-whistle:</p><blockquote><p>Are there any genetic contributors to differences between groups in cognitive abilities? It is not my area of expertise, and I don\u2019t have any particular interest in the question. I would leave to others, who have more relevant knowledge, to debate whether or not in addition to environmental factors, epigenetic or genetic factors play any role.</p></blockquote><p>Myself and other EAs I know are worried about professional reputational risks of continued association with the EA movement or longtermism. This is not just a PR risk, and despite my view that this reflects terribly on Nick and any comms experts who may have been involved in this, I don't want this to imply that the PR angle is what we should be primarily concerned about here-it isn't! But whether or not one of the leaders of EA has held racist views for decades, and whether he still basically holds them today is important.</p><p>It has real implications for the movement's future, including selection effects on people who may become more uncertain about the views that intellectual leaders of the EA/longtermism movement hold (and by extension, its intellectual foundations), whether EA is a community for \"people like them\", and whether EA is a movement that is well-equipped to preserve a future for all of humanity. Even if they aren't uncertain, they may be more reluctant to take risks to continue or become more outwardly involved in an increasingly controversial social movement.

Introduction</h2><p>The biosecurity space has promising technical interventions, such as UV-C and metagenomic sequencing. Often, students in college and community-builders are interested in biosecurity, but don\u2019t have an in-depth understanding of the solutions. This is concerning for 3 central reasons:</p><ol><li>Poor explanations are presented for biosecurity solutions, and may contain inaccuracies<ol><li>The reputation of the biosecurity community is damaged</li><li>Public perception of biosecurity interventions will be off the mark relative to the intervention\u2019s true effectiveness (e.g. \u201cfar UVC will end pandemics by 2025\u201d)</li><li>As a consequence, people are turned away from biosecurity</li></ol></li><li>Promising people transition to other fields of work<ol><li>When someone doesn\u2019t understand the specifics, it\u2019s highly unlikely that they\u2019ll pursue direct work, e.g. building a startup for that technology</li><li>Instead, they\u2019ll likely transition to community-building or traditional career paths</li></ol></li><li>Biosecurity culture becomes diluted and can\u2019t attract technically bright researchers or entrepreneurs<ol><li>Competence is magnetic, and promoting a culture of technical learning and deep dives is crucial to doing impactful work in a domain as challenging as biosecurity</li></ol></li></ol><p><strong>A technical biosecurity program can serve as a way for students to become much more knowledgeable about biosecurity solutions.</strong></p><h2>2. Context</h2><p>There have been biosecurity discussion groups run in the past, but most of these groups focus on the top-of-the-funnel content\u2014the introductory information and context that helps to form a foundation. To our knowledge, there doesn\u2019t yet exist a deep dive group, one that specifically aims to equip students with technical understanding of various biosecurity interventions.&nbsp;</p><p>When it comes to precedent, there have been similar discussion and research mentorship programs in the field of AI alignment, including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.agisafetyfundamentals.com\"><u>AGISF</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.serimats.org\"><u>SERI MATS</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CphfDP4ynz3QQ4AKY/introducing-the-ml-safety-scholars-program#:~:text=The%20Machine%20Learning%20Safety%20Scholars,program%20here%20by%20May%2031st.\"><u>MLSS</u></a>, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cerifellowship.org\"><u>CERI Fellowship</u></a> for biosecurity, nuclear risk, climate change, and AI safety. These programs have been largely successful, providing hundreds of students with hands-on technical experience or in-depth discussions about particular domains of AI safety.</p><h2>3. Program</h2><h3>About</h3><p>Our proposal is to establish an online 8-week-long technical deep dive group. This group will explore many crucial aspects of technical biosecurity interventions while ensuring that we maintain an emphasis on defensive interventions. Examples of session topics include far-UVC, SotA for PPE, and the NAO (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16ipgWg2twq0djOg5KjziWjfuEP8JBBsnkhxCB4Qks_s/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>syllabus</u></a>). The program will culminate in a research presentation for a chosen aspect of related topics and interventions (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u26DsvslGn5bCbAorYSvypW79LrVjXV1Y_h-AUpSi8s/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>more details here</u></a>). Each group will meet once per week and will have ~5 people. The expected weekly time commitment is 2-3 hours.</p><p>There will be a virtual and in-person pilot of this program. Everyone is eligible to apply for the virtual program. The in-person program seminar group will be held at Stanford, though depending on demand we may also run an in-person group at Berkeley.</p><p>There are a few reasons for running a primarily virtual program:</p><ol><li>It\u2019s important to have an experienced biosecurity person facilitating, which usually limits these interactions to virtual</li><li>Virtual programs are much more scalable and flexible</li><li>It\u2019s easier to reach a critical mass of students</li></ol><p>If you would like to join, please feel free to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forms.gle/mnKo4htaFexqmipG8\"><u>apply</u></a>! The application deadline is Friday, Jan 20th, and the program is expected to start in 2-3 weeks. We expect to start by running a few groups in parallel at different times during the week to accommodate those in different time zones.&nbsp;</p><h3>Syllabus</h3><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/16ipgWg2twq0djOg5KjziWjfuEP8JBBsnkhxCB4Qks_s/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>This is the syllabus</u></a> with the content we will be covering. There will also be an optional research poster to be submitted 2 weeks after the end of the course. The best 2-3 research presentations will be awarded a prize of $500 (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u26DsvslGn5bCbAorYSvypW79LrVjXV1Y_h-AUpSi8s/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>further details</u></a>).</p><h3>Goals</h3><p>Our goal is to introduce early-career individuals to various technical interventions within the field of biosecurity, and explore the existing literature in depth through groups. We think that many of these interventions have the potential to reduce global catastrophic biorisk by a considerable amount and that the biosecurity community is uniquely positioned to develop these interventions. Ultimately, the hope is that better understanding of these topics will lead to improved solutions communication, focused research, and ambitious projects (and companies!) that aim to bring promising biosecurity interventions to the public.</p><h3>Eligibility</h3><p>Because the group will be covering technical content in the field of biology, it\u2019s expected that students applying have at least a foundational understanding of undergraduate biology (e.g. immunology, microbiology, molecular biology, cell signaling, basic lab techniques). There are no geographical or age requirements, given that we will be running the program virtually as well as in-person.</p><h2>4. Further considerations</h2><h3>Funding</h3><p>We estimate most of the explicit costs of a virtual program like this to be organizer time. In future iterations, if the program is run in-person on several campuses, costs might include:</p><ul><li>Textbooks for additional learning</li><li>Snacks/drinks for seminar sessions</li><li>Reimbursements for speaker time/travel</li><li>Stipends for student time and work</li><li>Organizer/facilitator pay</li><li>End of program dinner</li></ul><p>These costs certainly add up over time (although these numbers are still well within the range of standard Long-Term Future Fund grants). And if this deep dive group is able to provide a solid foundation for even a few students to counterfactually pursue technical biosecurity work, then the impact generated would amount to potentially thousands of lives saved.</p><h3>Attention and info hazards</h3><p>Each group will be facilitated by an experienced biosecurity researcher, in order to make sure that the conversations stay on topic and don\u2019t veer off into the weeds. Additionally, all of the content that will be covered will be defensive in nature, and the science is readily accessible through a quick Google Search. The main function of this group isn\u2019t to introduce new interventions, but rather to improve understanding of the biology and physics behind these interventions.</p><h2>5. Conclusion</h2><p>This is one of the programs that we\u2019ll be running as part of the SERI Biosecurity Initiative, which aims to drastically improve pandemic preparedness for billions globally in the decades to come.

However, I had already been engaging with various EA content prior to this, without even knowing that it was closely linked to EA.</p><p>These sessions introduced me to the EA forum, through which I learned about the University Groups Accelerator Program, which aims to increase support for EA cause areas by providing support to university groups around the globe.</p><p>The application procedure was simple, and after a few interviews, training sessions, and mentorship meetings, I was finally prepared to launch the Uni group.</p><p>Running a university group involved a variety of tasks, including but not limited to:</p><ol><li>Outreach &amp; group growth strategy</li><li>Curriculum development</li><li>Event planning (dinners, socials, retreat 1-on-1s)</li><li>Community health</li></ol><p>I'll stick to a few of the semi-distinctive aspects that make founding a university organisation alone, and especially among the first few Uni groups on my continent, something worth writing about and perhaps someone will borrow a leaf from my experience. Although this advise may occasionally be particular or generic, it is hopefully still useful. So here goes.</p><p><strong>1. The importance of making the group a place where people want to be</strong></p><p>&nbsp;I recently attended an EA related conference and give a brief talk on my experience and one of the attendees asked me if I had to pick the one thing that made my group successful and I picked: <i>\"make the group a fun place to be\"</i>.<br>I can't insist enough how much this helps to build a sense of community. It is important to provide a variety of activities and experiences that allow members to have fun and make memories together. By creating a place where people want to be, the group can create a strong sense of community and foster a culture of collaboration, creativity, and progress.</p><p>Some activities that worked for us included:</p><ul><li>Having some unique ice-breakers before each session like this one <a href=\"http://web.askhole.io/\">here</a>.</li><li>Finding a conducive space where the fellows can be away from distractions and can just relax and unwind with free pizza and soft drinks.</li><li>Holding a game-night. I asked around for some games that may be fun among my group and settled on a few board games, a quiz night of sorts as well as some digital games too.</li></ul><p>But apart from the fun activities, the group was a place where intellectually stimulating discussions could be had and meaningful connections could be made. We sought to create an atmosphere of respect, inclusiveness and collaboration, which allowed for people to learn from each other, share ideas and grow. This was an essential part of making the group a place where people not only wanted to be, but wanted to stay and contribute.</p><p><strong>2. Watch for community health</strong></p><p>In order to make the group inviting and engaging, it is important to create a safe space where people can express their thoughts and ideas without fear of judgment. This can be achieved by having a code of conduct, providing resources and support for members, and fostering an atmosphere of openness and respect. By making the group a place where people want to be, it will be easier to attract and keep passionate and committed members to the effective altruism movement in Africa. Furthermore, it is important to monitor the interactions between members, provide helpful resources, and encourage positive experiences. Doing so will result in a strong, vibrant, and supportive community that is dedicated to the success of its members and the mission of making a positive impact.</p><p><strong>3. Learn more about EA and engage with a bunch of EA-related content</strong></p><p>I discovered that expanding my knowledge of EA and EA-related material has been a tremendous help in my quest to start an effective altruism movement in Africa.</p><p>I was been able to use this information to develop a keenly engaged &nbsp;audience of fellows in my University, and by also from studying the best practices for building a successful organisation to researching the condition of EA currently in the continent I was able to learn from others as well as from deductive reasoning produce some helpful knowledge that I later used.</p><p>The EA forum as well as other EA related organisations are ideal places to begin if you want to learn more about EA or get engaged with it.</p><p>I would frequently be asked about a particular subject by a fellow, and because I had made the effort to understand more than just what was offered in the virtual programs' curricula, I could respond. This is not to suggest that I never struggled to explain a concept or provide a solution to a question, but that is where the following pointer comes in.</p><p><strong>4. Ask for help</strong></p><p>Sometimes I required assistance setting up the delivery of the food and drinks to the location since I was unsure how to explain a specific notion to my group. Other times, I just wanted some assistance. Delegating some chores to the fellows makes your job much simpler, and you also get to develop some of the fellows into future facilitators and determine who is prepared to go above and beyond.</p><p>I also had a mentor who I saw once a week for the duration of the semester, and who helped me understand some of the concepts and provided me advice on how to facilitate better.</p><p>Special thank you to Jordan.</p><p><strong>Specific tips for an African University Group</strong></p><ul><li>Be mindful of the group formation, financial, and constitution policies at your university. Some colleges like exerting undue control over all the student organisations that they are involved with. You, as the facilitator, must exercise judgment in determining how to best present your university group as a registered student organisation (if you chose to do so at all).</li><li>It was more difficult to fully explain some concepts in EA than others. A particularly fascinating discussion focused on extending our compassion to animals and tackling factory farming. Even after the discussion, it was always a topic of intense dispute. The main tip I'd recommend is this: Effective Altruism is an offer, and your duty as a facilitator is not simply to sell the ideals of EA but to steer conversations towards a health path.</li><li>Encourage members to consume materials from EA outside of their course work, including material from the EA forum and social media.</li><li>Encourage people to take action, whether it's changing their diet, applying for internships, or volunteering at a group that supports an EA-related cause.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>\"We don't inherit the Earth from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children</strong>.\"</i></p><p>This is probably the most overused saying ever, yet it has a special importance for me.<br>I firmly believe that by exercising wise judgment and banding together, we may change the course of history and build a altruistic movement that is motivated by a deep-seated concern for the welfare of humanity and the potential to significantly improve the state of the world.</p><p>I'm really eager to see what lies ahead and, most importantly, to take part in this movement.</p>", "user": {"username": "Tim K.

In 1822, Britain passed the first national law protecting farm animals. Two centuries later, most countries \u2014 including China and the United States \u2014 still lack such a law. In 1975, Peter Singer published <i>Animal Liberation</i>. Half a century later, about ten times more animals are factory farmed every year.<br><br>But in the last decade, advocates have achieved unprecedented progress for farm animals. For the holidays, I want to step back and reflect on everything you\u2019ve achieved \u2014 and much of it was achieved by readers of this newsletter \u2014 to start to turn the tide for farm animals.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Corporate Change</strong></h3><p>A decade ago, most of the world\u2019s largest food corporations lacked even a basic farm animal welfare policy. Today, they almost all have one. That\u2019s thanks to advocates, who won about <a href=\"https://chickenwatch.org/progress-tracker/\"><u>3,000</u></a> new corporate policies in the last ten years.<br><br>Take the battery cage. About seven billion birds, or roughly one for every human on the planet, are crammed into these microwave-sized containers. A decade ago, Europe had just moved to slightly larger enriched cages, and US advocates were pushing for a similar reform. Abolishing cages altogether seemed impossible.&nbsp;<br><br>That changed in 2015-18, as advocates secured cage-free pledges from almost all of the largest American and European retailers, fast food chains, and foodservice companies. Advocates then extended this work globally, securing major pledges from Brazil to Thailand. Most recently, advocates won the first global cage-free pledges from <a href=\"https://chickenwatch.org/progress-tracker/\"><u>150</u></a> multinationals, including the world\u2019s largest hotel chains and food manufacturers.<br><br>A major question was whether these companies would follow through on their pledges. So far, almost <a href=\"https://assets.ctfassets.net/ww1ie0z745y7/6jxWMUFP7xKDhN5rbZJ8KA/78844b8a3b274575ad22bef1b655b555/OWA-2022-cage-free-egg-fulfillment-report-final.pdf\"><u>1,000</u></a> companies have \u2014 that\u2019s 88% of the companies that promised to go cage-free by the end of last year. Another <a href=\"https://www.eggtrack.com/en/\"><u>75%</u></a> of the world\u2019s largest food companies are now publicly reporting on their progress in going cage-free.&nbsp;<br><br>Of course, some companies will still shirk their pledges. But 165M more hens are already cage-free in Europe and the US today than were a decade ago, and advocates are on track to help over 300M more just by getting companies to follow through on their existing policies</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673457974/mirroredImages/QKa5PGiasWqeL75A7/liewhbffruko3ql5mloq.png\"><figcaption>One measure of corporate progress: in 2012, the Business Benchmark for Farm Animal Welfare could find only nine companies to meet its then quite lenient standards for the top three tiers.

Germany\u2019s biggest meat producer <a href=\"https://www.karlsruhe-insider.de/verbraucher/groesster-fleischhersteller-haelfte-vom-sortiment-soll-vegetarisch-werden-110390\"><u>said</u></a> this year that half of its future product range will be meatless. One of the world\u2019s largest seafood companies, Thai Union, even <a href=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Food-Beverage/Impossible-Tuna-Thai-Union-dives-into-plant-based-seafood\"><u>launched</u></a> plant-based seafood.<br><br>The world\u2019s largest fast food chains now mostly have a plant-based option \u2014 with one noticeable McException. Yum Brands, owner of KFC and Pizza Hut, <a href=\"https://www.yum.com/wps/portal/yumbrands/Yumbrands/citizenship-and-sustainability/food/plant-based-options\"><u>calls</u></a> plant-based foods \u201cpart of a global movement influencing menus at all of our restaurants.\u201d Burger King is selling plant-based whoppers at most of its global locations; in Belgium, they now account for <a href=\"https://t.co/FMLBHgRqTF\"><u>one in three</u></a> whoppers sold.&nbsp;<br><br>Even after a bad year, plant-based meat sales are more than twice what they were five years ago. Alternative protein startups have raised a \u201cmere\u201d <a href=\"https://www.goodsignal.com/p/looking-back-moving-forward-the-alternative\"><u>$2.2B</u></a> so far this year, down from a colossal $5B last year, but still about $2.2B more than they raised in 2012. Globally, over <a href=\"https://gfi.org/resource/alternative-protein-company-database/#manufacturers-and-brands\"><u>1,000</u></a>&nbsp;such companies are now racing to bring new products to market, including over 200 in Asia.<br><br>Americans can soon join Singaporeans in sampling cultured meat, thanks to a recent FDA approval. And governments are finally investing the long-term patient capital needed to solve the major technical barriers to scalability that remain. Most recently, the Netherlands allocated a record <a href=\"https://www.tudelft.nl/en/2022/tnw/dutch-government-confirms-eur60m-investment-into-cellular-agriculture\"><u>\u20ac60M</u></a> to the space.<br><br>Indeed, alternative proteins seem to be growing on even the world's largest governments. China\u2019s President Xi <a href=\"https://english.news.cn/20220307/e98039b53ab8418e9684c0c5847e943c/c.html\"><u>spoke</u></a> of them this year, as <a href=\"https://apps.fas.usda.gov/newgainapi/api/Report/DownloadReportByFileName?fileName=Agriculture%20Key%20Component%20of%20Bio-economy%20Five-Year%20Plan%20%20_Beijing_China%20-%20People%27s%20Republic%20of_CH2022-0065.pdf\"><u>did</u></a> China\u2019s new Bioeconomy five year plan.

And the EU member states\u2019 new Common Agricultural Policy strategic <a href=\"https://agriculture.ec.europa.eu/cap-my-country/cap-strategic-plans/approved-csp-0_en\"><u>plans</u></a> made frequent mention of them.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673457975/mirroredImages/QKa5PGiasWqeL75A7/dezf6hnnbrww13sdujqa.png\"><figcaption>Money sometimes grows on trees (or at least plants): investment in alternative proteins rose over 50X over the last decade. Source: Good Food Institute</figcaption></figure><h3><strong>Moral Circle Expansion</strong></h3><p>In 2012, the world\u2019s few farm animal welfare laws and corporate policies mostly just covered mammals. We were largely too chicken to take on the plight of the roughly 30B birds, or the roughly 75B fish, on factory farms. And we all lacked the backbone to talk about the plight of the hundreds of billions of aquatic invertebrates.<br><br>Since then, almost every new farm animal welfare law and corporate policy globally has focused on chickens. Seven US states, led by California and Massachusetts, banned battery cages and the sale of caged eggs. Austria, France, and Germany banned the killing of most day-old male chicks \u2014 all three laws went into effect this year. The European Commission recently <a href=\"https://www.eurogroupforanimals.org/news/victory-chicks-eu-commission-propose-end-male-chick-culling\"><u>promised</u></a> to follow suit across Europe \u2014 and to ban cages and raise standards for chickens raised for their meat.&nbsp;<br><br>Fish welfare is also finally rising to the surface. British and German retailers adopted their first fish welfare policies, as did the world\u2019s biggest fish sustainability certification schemes. Canada, the Netherlands, Norway, and Spain adopted the world\u2019s first national guidelines on fish welfare. And the EU may soon require all farmed fish in the bloc to be stunned before slaughter \u2014 a small mercy still denied to almost all of the world\u2019s fish.<br><br>Popular opinion agrees. A 2018 <a href=\"https://www.politique-animaux.fr/fichiers/fish_welfare_survey_-_comres_pour_eurogroup_for_animals_ciwf_-_2018.pdf\"><u>survey</u></a> of 9,000 Europeans found that 79% think the welfare of fish should be protected as much as the welfare of other farm animals. A new <a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fanim.2022.960379/full\"><u>survey</u></a> found that 60-95% of people surveyed in 14 large countries, including China, India, and the US, believe that chickens and fish can feel both pain and emotions.<br><br>Even crabs are crawling into the limelight. The world\u2019s biggest shrimp producer, CP Foods, <a href=\"https://www.cpfworldwide.com/en/media-center/sustainability-1359\"><u>stopped</u></a> cutting the eyestalks off breeding females. And this year, the UK this year <a href=\"https://www.eurogroupforanimals.org/news/uk-sentience-bill-passes-final-stages-recognise-decapod-and-cephalopod-sentience-law\"><u>enacted</u></a> an animal sentience bill that for the first time recognized crabs, octopus, and lobsters as sentient beings.&nbsp;<br><br>The movement to help farm animals has also become truly global. A decade ago, almost all advocacy was concentrated in Europe and the US. Today over 200 groups advocate for farm animals across over 100&nbsp;countries, accounting for over 90% of the world\u2019s farm animals.&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p>None of this progress was inevitable. It was mostly the result of sustained and focused advocacy, much of it done and funded by all of you. This holiday, I hope you\u2019ll take a moment to celebrate the progress you\u2019ve helped achieve. And, if you can, I hope you\u2019ll pledge to devote your time or money toward accelerating this progress in 2023. We still have a very long way to go. But you make me optimistic that we\u2019ll get there \u2014 and I\u2019m grateful for all that you do for the animals.

It's inspired by David Pearce's Hedonistic Imperative.</p><p>The idea is to sketch out a detailed road map for developing an in vivo gene therapy for mood improvement. It seems like the essential technology for this now exists, but I haven't seen any sign of anyone working practically on this specific problem. Presumably some day some big biotech company will take this on, but I'm curious whether some enthusiastic amateurs can make any meaningful progress. Things like:</p><p>- Fleshing out the technical theory of a therapy. I'm thinking AAV-based, but open to other ideas. What specific viral (or other) vector variant to use, what promoter, what transgene to try, how to deliver to the target brain area, potential side effects, etc. Eventually aiming towards a fully designed viral vector code, with delivery method.</p><p>- Thinking about testing. Assume we think we have achieved the previous step. Without the backing or budget of a major lab, how difficult is it to carry out animal tests? Could it be done somewhere in the world with sufficient scientific standards but lower cost and/or regulatory barriers?</p><p>- Ultimately human testing will be the end goal, this is well down the road and probably the most challenging aspect but still worth thinking about.</p><p>Rather than thinking in terms of attracting capital, licensing, commercialization etc, I want to focus on establishing a working therapy, though of course some capital would be required to get anything done.</p><p>I have some ideas about these things of course, but would like to get more brains involved if there is interest. For example, I lack the expertise to bridge the gap between designing a viral vector and having something physically ready to administer to an organism.</p><p>Alternatively if anyone knows anyone who's already working on a similar project I'd appreciate being pointed in the right direction. I'm already in discussion with someone from a project with similar aims but focusing more on germline therapy.</p><p>Please comment or PM me if interested or have questions!</p>", "user": {"username": "Ray Allen"}}, {"_id": "eyJDBdpDd4BxormPH", "title": "Resources I send to AI researchers about AI safety", "postedAt": "2023-01-11T01:24:29.815Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "Vael Gates"}}, {"_id": "SJXSPbuWdiaikm3fg", "title": "McGill EA x Law Presents: Impact Litigation for Animal Welfare", "postedAt": "2023-01-11T00:00:30.909Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Farmed animals are widespread in number and suffering.

He also offered for CEA to be the custodian of the domains I bought, with the condition that they will be pointed to nameservers I control and that they will return ownership of them for EA-aligned use on request, unless they\u2019re in active use by another EA project. This will save me from having to pay upkeep, which will help make this more sustainable. He's open to extending this offer to holders of other relevant domains.</p><p>If you'd like to use one of these domains, then message the contact person specified. They each have different policies for handing over the domain, but a good standard is that they'll point the domain towards your servers on request, and hand it over for free if and when you have built something useful at that location.</p><p>Here\u2019s the top 40 domains I\u2019m most excited about, but go check <a href=\"https://ea.domains/\">the full list</a>:</p><figure

Is it only the vain and traditional boast of each \"modern'\" generation? Since I have admitted no substantial change in man's nature during historic times, all technological advances will have to be written off as merely new means of achieving old ends\u2014the acquisition of goods, the pursuit of one sex by the other (or by the same), the overcoming of competition, the fighting of wars. One of the discouraging discoveries of our disillusioning century is that science is neutral: it will kill for us as readily as it will heal, and will destroy for us more readily than it can build. How inadequate now seems the proud motto of Francis Bacon, \"Knowledge is power\"! Sometimes we feel that the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, which stressed mythology and art rather than science and power, may have been wiser than we, who repeatedly enlarge our instrumentalities without improving our purposes.&nbsp;</p><p>Our progress in science and technique has involved some tincture of evil with good. Our comforts and conveniences may have weakened our physical stamina and our moral fiber. We have immensely developed our means of locomotion, but some of us use them to facilitate crime and to kill our fellow men or ourselves. We double, triple, centuple our speed, but we shatter our nerves in the process, and are the same trousered apes at two thousand miles an hour as when we had legs. We applaud the cures and incisions of modern medicine if they bring no side effects worse than the malady; we appreciate the assiduity of our physicians in their mad race with the resilience of microbes and the inventiveness of disease; we are grateful for the added years that medical science gives us if they are not a burden\u2014some prolongation of illness, disability, and gloom. We have multiplied a hundred times our ability to learn and report the events of the day and the planet, but at times we envy our ancestors, whose peace was only gently disturbed by the news of their village. We have laudably bettered the conditions of life for skilled workingmen and the middle class, but we have allowed our cities to fester with dark ghettos and slimy slums.&nbsp;</p><p>We frolic in our emancipation from theology, but have we developed a natural ethic\u2014a moral code independent of religion\u2014strong enough to keep our instincts of acquisition, pugnacity, and sex from debasing our civilization into a mire of greed, crime, and promiscuity? Have we really outgrown intolerance, or merely transferred it from religious to national, ideological, or racial hostilities? Are our manners better than before, or worse? \"Manners,\" said a nineteenth- century traveler, \"get regularly worse as you go from the East to the West; it is bad in Asia, not so good in Europe, and altogether bad in the western states of America\". And now the East imitates the West. Have our laws offered the criminal too much protection against society and the state? Have we given ourselves more freedom than our intelligence can digest? Or are we nearing such moral and social disorder that frightened parents will run back to Mother Church and beg her to discipline their children, at whatever cost to intellectual liberty? Has all the progress of philosophy since Descartes been a mistake through its failure to recognize the role of myth in the consolation and control of man? \"Does that increaseth knowledge increaseth sorrow, and in much wisdom is much grief?\"&nbsp;</p><p>Has there been any progress at all in philosophy since Confucius? Or in literature since Aeschylus? Are we sure that our music, with its complex forms and powerful orchestras, is more profound than Palestrina, or more musical and inspiring than the monodic airs that medieval Arabs sang to the strumming of their simple instruments? (Edward Lane said of the Cairo musicians, \"I have been more charmed with their songs...than with any other music that I have ever enjoyed.\") How does our contemporary architecture\u2014bold, original, and impressive as it is\u2014compare with the temples of ancient Egypt or Greece, or our sculpture with the statues of Chephren and Hermes, or our bas-reliefs with those of Persepolis or the Parthenon, or our paintings with those of the van Eycks or Holbein? If \"the replacement of chaos with order is the essence of art and civilization,\" is contemporary painting in America and Western Europe the replacement of order with chaos, and a vivid symbol of our civilization's relapse into confused and structureless decay?&nbsp;</p><p>History is so indifferently rich that a case for almost any conclusion from it can be made by a selection of instances. Choosing our evidence with a brighter bias, we might evolve some more comforting reflections. But perhaps we should first define what progress means to us. If it means increase in happiness its case is lost almost at first sight. Our capacity for fretting is endless, and no matter how many difficulties we surmount, how many ideals we realize, we shall always find an excuse for being magnificently miserable; there is a stealthy pleasure in rejecting mankind or the universe as unworthy of our approval. It seems silly to define progress in terms that would make the average child a higher, more advanced product of life than the adult or the sage\u2014for certainly the child is the happiest of the three. Is a more objective definition possible? We shall here define progress as the increasing control of the environment by life. It is a test that may hold for the lowliest organism as well as for man.&nbsp;</p><p>We must not demand of progress that it should be continuous or universal. Obviously there are retrogressions, just as there are periods of failure, fatigue, and rest in a developing individual; if the present stage is an advance in control of the environment, progress is real. We may presume that at almost any time in history some nations were progressing and some were declining, as Russia progresses and England loses ground today. The same nation may be progressing in one field of human activity and retrogressing in another, as America is now progressing in technology and receding in the graphic arts. If we find that the type of genius prevalent in young countries like America and Australia tends to the practical, inventive, scientific, executive kinds rather than to the painter of pictures or poems, the carver of statues or words, we must understand that each age and place needs and elicits some types of ability rather than others in its pursuit of environmental control. We should not compare the work of one land and time with the winnowed best of all the collected past. Our problem is whether the average man has increased his ability to control the conditions of his life.</p><p>If we take a long-range view and compare our modern existence, precarious, chaotic, and murderous as it is, with the ignorance, superstition, violence, and diseases of primitive peoples, we do not come off quite forlorn. The lowliest strata in civilized states may still differ only slightly from barbarians, but above those levels thousands, millions have reached mental and moral levels rarely found among primitive men. Under the complex strains of city life we sometimes take imaginative refuge in the supposed simplicity of pre-civilized ways, but in our less romantic moments we know that this is a flight reaction from our actual tasks, and that the idolizing of savages, like many other young moods, is an impatient expression of adolescent maladaptation, of conscious ability not yet matured and comfortably placed. The \"friendly and flowing savage\" would be delightful but for his scalpel, his insects, and his dirt. A study of surviving primitive tribes reveals their high rate of infantile mortality, their short tenure of life, their lesser stamina and speed, their greater susceptibility to disease.: If the prolongation of life indicates better control of the environment, then the tables of mortality proclaim the advance of man, for longevity in European and American whites has tripled in the last three centuries. Some time ago a convention of morticians discussed the danger threatening their industry from the increasing tardiness of men in keeping their rendezvous with death. But if undertakers are miserable progress is real.&nbsp;</p><p>In the debate between ancients and moderns it is not at all clear that the ancients carry off the prize. Shall we count it a trivial achievement that famine has been eliminated in modern states, and that one country can now grow enough food to overfeed itself and yet send hundreds of millions of bushels of wheat to nations in need? Are we ready to scuttle the science that has so diminished superstition, obscurantism, and religious intolerance, or the technology that has spread food, home ownership, comfort, education, and leisure beyond any precedent? Would we really prefer the Athenian agora or the Roman comitia to the British Parliament or the United States Congress, or be content under a narrow franchise like Attica's, or the selection of rulers by a praetorian guard? Would we rather have lived under the laws of the Athenian Republic or the Roman Empire than under constitutions that give us habeas corpus, trial by jury, religious and intellectual freedom, and the emancipation of women? Are our morals, lax though they are, worse than those of the ambisexual Alcibiades, or has any American President imitated Pericles, who lived with a learned courtesan? Are we ashamed of our great universities, our many publishing houses, our bountiful public libraries? There were great dramatists in Athens, but was any greater than Shakespeare, and was Aristophanes as profound and humane as Moli\u00e8re? Was the oratory of Demosthenes, Isocrates, and Aeschines superior to that of Chatham, Burke, and Sheridan? Shall we place Gibbon below Herodotus or Thucydides: Is there anything in ancient prose fiction comparable to the scope and depth of the modern novel? We may grant the superiority of the ancients in art, though some of us might still prefer Notre Dame de Paris to the Parthenon. If the Founding Fathers of the United States could return to America, or Fox and Bentham to England, or Voltaire and Diderot to France, would they not reproach us as ingrates for our blindness to our good fortune in living today and not yesterday\u2014not even under Pericles or Augustus?&nbsp;</p><p>We should not be greatly disturbed by the probability that our civilization will die like any other. As Frederick asked his retreating troops at Kolin, \"Would you live forever?\" Perhaps it is desirable that life should take fresh forms, that new civilizations and centers should have their turn. Meanwhile the effort to meet the challenge of the rising East may reinvigorate the West.&nbsp;</p><p>We have said that a great civilization does not entirely die\u2014<i>non omnis moritur</i>. Some precious achievements have survived all the vicissitudes of rising and falling states: the making of fire and light, of the wheel and other basic tools; language, writing, art, and song; agriculture, the family, and parental care; social organization, morality, and charity; and the use of teaching to transmit the lore of the family and the race. These are the elements of civilization, and they have been tenaciously maintained through the perilous passage from one civilization to the next. They are the connective tissue of human history.</p><p>If education is the transmission of civilization, we are unquestionably progressing. Civilization is not inherited; it has to be learned and earned by each generation anew; if the transmission should be interrupted for one century, civilization would die, and we would be savages again. So our finest contemporary achievement is our unprecedented expenditure of wealth and toil in the provision of higher education for all. Once colleges were luxuries, designed for the male half of the leisure class; today universities are so numerous that he who runs may become a Ph.D. We may not have excelled the selected geniuses of antiquity, but we have raised the level and average of knowledge beyond any age in history.</p><p>None but a child will complain that our teachers have not yet eradicated the errors and superstitions of ten thousand years. The great experiment has just begun, and it may yet be defeated by the high birth rate of unwilling or indoctrinated ignorance. But what would be the full fruitage of instruction if every child should be schooled till at least his twentieth year, and should find free access to the universities, libraries, and museums that harbor and offer the intellectual and artistic treasures of the race? Consider education not as the painful accumulation of facts and dates and reigns, nor merely the necessary preparation of the individual to earn his keep in the world, but as the transmission of our mental, moral, technical, and aesthetic heritage as fully as possible to as many as possible, for the enlargement of man's understanding, control, embellishment, and enjoyment of life.&nbsp;</p><p>The heritage that we can now more fully transmit is richer than ever before. It is richer than that of Pericles, for it includes all the Greek flowering that followed him; richer than Leonardo's, for it includes him and the Italian Renaissance; richer than Voltaire's, for it embraces all the French Enlightenment and its ecumenical dissemination. If progress is real despite our whining, it is not because we are born any healthier, better, or wiser than infants were in the past, but because we are born to a richer heritage, born on a higher level of that pedestal which the accumulation of knowledge and art makes as the ground and support of our being. The heritage rises, and man rises in proportion as he receives it.&nbsp;</p><p>History is, above all else, the creation and recording of that heritage, progress is its increasing abundance, preservation, transmission, and use. To those of us who study history not merely as a warning reminder of man's follies and crimes, but also as an encouraging remembrance of generative souls, the past ceases to be a depressing chamber of horrors; it becomes a celestial city, a spacious country of the mind, wherein a thousand saints, statesmen, inventors, scientists, poets, artists, musicians, lovers, and philosophers still live and speak, teach and carve and sing. The historian will not mourn because he can see no meaning in human existence except that which man puts into it; let it be our pride that we ourselves may put meaning into our lives, and sometimes a significance that transcends death. If a man is fortunate he will, before he dies, gather up as much as he can of his civilized heritage and transmit it to his children. And to his final breath he will be grateful for this inexhaustible legacy, knowing that it is our nourishing mother and our lasting life.</p><hr><h2>Comment</h2><ol><li>\u201c<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/BoneAppleTea/comments/9j50o5/legit_knowledge_is_power_france_is_bacon/\"><u>Knowledge is power, France is Bacon.</u></a>\u201d</li><li>My favorite parts: \u201ctrousered apes\u201d, \u201cWe frolic in our emancipation from theology\u201d, \u201cBut if undertakers are miserable progress is real.\u201d, \u201cThey are the connective tissue of human history.\u201d, \u201cCivilization is not inherited; it has to be learned and earned by each generation anew; if the transmission should be interrupted for one century, civilization would die, and we would be savages again.\u201d, and the last paragraph &lt;3.

In September 1940 Benjamin committed suicide during an attempt to flee the Nazi regime. After World War II, Benjamin's friend <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gershom_Scholem\"><u>Gershom Scholem</u></a>, a distinguished scholar of Jewish mysticism, inherited the drawing. According to Scholem, Benjamin felt a mystical identification with the <i>Angelus Novus</i> and incorporated it in his theory of the \u201cangel of history,\u201d a melancholy view of historical process as an unceasing cycle of despair. In the ninth thesis of his 1940 essay \u201c<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theses_on_the_Philosophy_of_History\"><u>Theses on the Philosophy of History</u></a>\u201d, Benjamin describes <i>Angelus Novus</i> as an image of the angel of history:</p><blockquote><p>A Klee painting named <i>Angelus Novus</i> shows an angel looking as though he is about to move away from something he is fixedly contemplating. His eyes are staring, his mouth is open, his wings are spread. This is how one pictures the angel of history. His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. <strong>This storm is what we call progress.</strong></p></blockquote><p>3.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>\u201cBy \u201cprogress,\u201d we mean the combination of economic, technological, scientific, cultural, and organizational advancement that has transformed our lives and raised standards of living over the past couple of centuries. For a number of reasons, there is no broad-based intellectual movement focused on understanding the dynamics of progress, or targeting the deeper goal of speeding it up.

I like technology. I like progress. I think progress is good. I think suffering is bad. I think we should try to reduce it.<br><br>But there is still some part of me that just revolts at any glorification or emphasis of \u201cprogress\u201d, and there is another part of me that feels like progress studies is fundamentally misguided, if not actively counter-productive. Maybe some time in the future I\u2019ll write a lengthy anti-progress treatise, but for now here are a few brief objections and reflections. I probably believe about 61% of what follows and I\u2019m guessing that slightly less than that 61% of it makes any kind of sense.</p><p>I\u2019m skeptical about how beneficial it is to talk of progress and to directly aim to study it. I\u2019ve written about this before. From \u201c<a href=\"https://www.secretorum.life/p/20-modern-heresies?s=w\"><u>20 Modern Heresies</u></a>\u201d:</p><blockquote><p>\u201cProgress Studies is a waste of time. Most of what we have learned and could even possibly learn is either obvious (we already have good intuition about what policies and organizational structures stifle creativity and innovation), of highly limited value because it is idiosyncratic to specific domains, cultures, or time periods, or essentially impossible to act on in a meaningful way (scientific/technological ecosystems are so complex that interventions will either be ineffective or actively counterproductive). People who spend their time writing essays about how we can fix science and foster innovation are just trying to make themselves feel better about the fact that they are incapable of making any actual contribution to \u201cprogress\u201d (and yes I\u2019m talking about myself here). Progress Studies (and effective altruism and AI safety for that matter) have become so popular because they fill the religion-shaped hole in the hearts of frustrated nerds who are desperately searching for something to make their lives feel meaningful.\u201d</p></blockquote><p>And \u201c<a href=\"https://www.secretorum.life/p/fuck-your-miracle-year\"><u>Fuck your Miracle Year</u></a>\u201d:</p><blockquote><p>Look, no one talked about how we can engineer miracle years when</p><p>miracle years were actually still happening.

I worry that talking and thinking too much about ~*progress*~ will create a kind of species-wide <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law\"><u>goodharting</u></a> effect, leading us to aim for something that is a weak imitation of the better-left-unnamed thing that we should really be striving for.</p><blockquote><p>Do not ask whether it is \u201cthe Way\u201d to do this or that\u2026If you speak overmuch of the Way you will not attain it.</p></blockquote><p>4. \u201cScholem believed that after the Enlightenment, messianism was&nbsp;\u201csecularized as the belief in progress.\u201d\u2026Or as the Nobel Laureate Olga Tokarczuk has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Books_of_Jacob/u3EyEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;printsec=frontcover\"><u>written</u></a>: \u201cThe Messiah \u2026 is something that flows in your blood, resides in your breath, it is the dearest and most precious human thought: that salvation exists.\u201d&nbsp;</p><p>5.

We are at the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Infinity-Explanations-Transform-World/dp/0143121359\"><u>Beginning of Infinity</u></a> (and always will be); this existence is \u201cnot only stranger than we suppose, but stranger than we <i>can</i> suppose\u201d. Do we really imagine that our understanding of reality (of consciousness, of morality) is anything but the most hopeless of misunderstandings, something that in hindsight will look like a blunder of an almost unimaginable proportion? Do we really imagine that our descendants will not look back on us and laugh thunderously like gods and demons at our ignorance?</p><p>7. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BasedBeffJezos/status/1608422716293398529\">Beff Jezos on twitter</a>:</p><blockquote><p>\"The endgame of climbing the Kardashev gradient is manually-created black holes with fine-tuned parameters.

It is intended to be a big-picture piece, surfacing and investigating common beliefs within EA animal advocacy. Necessarily, I deal with generalisations of views, which will not cover all variations, organisations, or advocates.</p><h1>No Plans to (Re)Visit</h1><p>With respect to the ideas below, Faunalytics does/<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/research-in-progress/\"><u>will</u></a> cover&nbsp;<i>some&nbsp;</i>of them, including publishing (in the 14 months taken for this piece to be written),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/how-effective-is-cowspiracy/\"><u>one original study on the effectiveness of&nbsp;</u><i><u>Cowspiracy</u></i></a>. Charity Entrepreneurship has nothing on any of the below, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20211215171820/https://animalcharityevaluators.org/advocacy-interventions/interventions/\"><u>up until recently</u></a>, Animal Charity Evaluators only evaluated (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zri7LsivEAqnYZ6Wt/concerns-with-ace-research\"><u>poorly</u></a>) protest and leafleting, considering some (old-school) tactics like rescue or grassroots campaigning. Though&nbsp;<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/research/methodology/menu-of-interventions/\"><u>their new list</u></a> covers a variety of approaches, their second&nbsp;<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/about/background/goals-and-strategy/\"><u>philosophical commitment</u></a> (on pursuing actions on increasing welfare)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjllu82jf2o\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjllu82jf2o\">[1]</a></sup></span>, suggests that abolitionist approaches will not be a priority for them. Similarly,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/animal-welfare\"><u>EA Animal Welfare Fund</u></a> specifically lists that it supports only&nbsp;<i>\u201cpositive yet incremental changes\u201d&nbsp;</i>with regards to farmed animals.</p><p>For a movement which has much uncertainty (around what works and what\u2019s necessary) as animal advocacy, such a lack of plurality is concerning, and not just on theoretical grounds: charities like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/the-nonhuman-rights-project/\"><u>NHRP</u></a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/payouts/march-2018-animal-welfare-fund-grants\"><u>ProVeg</u></a> which were previously considered are now ignored.</p><h1>Scaling Animal Agriculture Transitions</h1><p>One promising line of abolishing animal agriculture is by helping animal farmers transition, either directly and/or through policy campaigning.&nbsp;</p><p>For directly helping animal farmers transition, depending on the context, this can be a win-win and financially self-sustaining. The win for animal advocates is not just the usual reasons,&nbsp;<strong>but also in terms of public perception: it directly challenges the stereotype that animal advocates are \u2018anti-farmer\u2019.</strong></p><p>The win for animal farmers is worth spelling out: animal farmers, especially the ones running low-welfare, high-volume CAFOs, are often essentially franchisees. They are often financially stuck in a cycle where large loans are required to purchase approved standardised equipment, feed, and breeds from large scale meat suppliers, and with exacting standards and little bargaining power over the selling price. According to a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/getting-farmers-on-board-for-alternative-proteins/\"><u>recent Faunalytics summary</u></a> of a Proveg International Report:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cFarmers are already feeling the effects of climate change through reduced [feed] crop yields and increasing weather volatility. Health concerns, along with increasing awareness of agriculture\u2019s impact on the environment, are changing consumer preferences in the Global North. Demand for animal-based foods is falling. Adding to farmers\u2019 challenges are increasing industry consolidation and intensification. Furthermore, many governments are changing their agriculture subsidies to reward pro-environmental practices.\u201d</i>.</p></blockquote><p>There are already charities working on this (<a href=\"https://en.refarmd.com/\"><u>Refarm\u2019d</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dairyfarmtransition.com\"><u>Dairy Farm Transition</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rancheradvocacy.org/\"><u>Rancher Advocacy Program</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://stockfreefarming.org/\"><u>Stock Free Farming</u></a> to name a few), and the lack of discussion within the EA community around this issue (no cost-effectiveness analyses, lack of research on ways to scale-up such operations) is perplexing.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbl65xap2yvc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbl65xap2yvc\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;As mentioned in this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/the-evolution-of-the-dairy-industry/\"><u>Faunalytics report on the evolution of the dairy industry</u></a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cDespite the widespread lack of profits in smaller farms, many dairy farms are slow to close down. Farms can continue operating as long as they are able to pay for immediate expenses, even if they cannot pay off their initial investments or afford regular maintenance of their equipment. Some farms supplement their income by allowing visitors (agrotourism) or selling calves and heifers. Many dairy farms also benefit from federal subsidies [...].\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>The report goes on to mention that farmers are ageing, and more small dairy farms are likely to close as a result. Allowing this to happen could cement resentment towards animal and environmental advocates, amongst a population (farmers) which carries a lot of social currency. However, decisive action could turn this threat into a prime opportunity to create unlikely allies and establish&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/n6aGf26V8cg\"><u>a new narrative</u></a> around abolishing animal farming, as explored in the Aotearoa New Zealand documentary&nbsp;<a href=\"https://milked.film/\"><i><u>Milked</u></i></a>.</p><p>Aside from informing policy directions, pursuing a bottom-up approach has another important advantage: establishing goodwill directly with the animal farmer community. Reasonable policy decisions can be met with resistance if perceived as a top-down push. For example, The Netherlands is Europe\u2019s largest beef exporter, but factory farming has resulted in serious ammonia pollution throughout the small country. The government has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/dec/15/netherlands-announces-25bn-plan-to-radically-reduce-livestock-numbers\"><u>unveiled plans</u></a> to&nbsp;<i>pay off</i> cattle farmers to&nbsp;<i>voluntarily</i> reduce the size of their herds across 13 years, but even this has faced huge backlash from farmers who have staged huge street protests in recent years over the prospects of such buyouts.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Transitions could be financially self-sustaining,</strong> if the new business the farmer transitions to is more profitable than the previous one. One could imagine a model where <strong>the immediate cost of transition could be borne out by charities, but then repaid over time, allowing the initial seed to go much further.</strong></p><p>Encouraging animal agriculture transition can also be done at a policy level. Movements like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plantbasedtreaty.org/\"><u>Plant-based Treaty</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.rebootfood.org/\"><u>Reboot Food</u></a> and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://50by40.org/2021/09/07/support-justlivestocktransition/\"><u>Just Livestock Transition</u></a> (and maybe&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fairr.org/\"><u>FAIRR</u></a>?) have already laid the foundations (not in the least by coming up with catchy names for the idea).&nbsp;<strong>Doing this in the right way could help not just farmers, but also (1) reduce/mitigate wild animal suffering (WAS) and (2) unlock the ability of&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>landowners</strong></i><strong> to take action.</strong> WAS could be reduced or mitigated by ensuring that animal agriculture transition policies do not rewild in a way which reintroduces predators.</p><p>As for landowners: I once attended a meeting of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/cambridgetris/\"><u>Trinity Responsible Investment Society</u></a>, and raised the issue of animal agriculture (agricultural land makes up a significant portion of the college\u2019s endowment). A fellow explained that some land leases expired as late as 2060, and even as landowners, they had no legal recourse to change what the leaseholders (farmers) did. With the right sort of policy adjustments and advocacy, animal advocates could allow (or even require) landowners to do their part, which would unlock the power of institutional investors to take action.</p><p>One could also argue that transitioning any particular farmer/country would simply displace production, potentially to lower animal-welfare standard farms or countries. This is a valid concern, even though it seems to me that (1) it would only apply in the initial stages and (2) there is historical precedent (<a href=\"https://www.history.co.uk/article/the-blockade-of-africa-how-royal-naval-ships-suppressed-the-slave-trade\"><u>the British Navy and Government's roles in convincing other countries to also abolish slave trading</u></a>) on how to mitigate this. All things considered, I believe the internal logic for scaling animal agriculture I\u2019ve laid out above is just as strong as that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/59NyMXxwn5pXFRsdh\"><u>for strategies the effective animal advocacy community is currently pursuing</u></a>. Worries about displacement don\u2019t seem to rule out the approach prima facie, if anything, it justifies the urgency and need for careful measurement and further research.</p><h1>Documentaries (and Other Media)</h1><p><a href=\"https://thehumaneleague.org/article/gfu-rcts\"><u>A Sep 2021 study</u></a> on the effectiveness of documentaries at reducing animal consumption found a documentary&nbsp;<i>\u201cdid not decrease meat and animal product [consumption 1 week after] compared to the control video when potential social desirability bias was minimized.\u201d</i>. Whilst the study is commendable for its design to minimise social desirability bias (saying what you think the researchers want to hear),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://osf.io/7j45f\"><u>the chosen documentary itself</u></a> was not representative of the sort of documentaries that gain mass viewership and discussion. It is 21 mins long (approximately 7 for health, 4 for environmental, 10 for animals). It hits all the major points (except fish catching and farming) and has an acceptable production quality. However, it\u2019s not of the same length or quality as popular Netflix documentaries,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://watchdominion.com/\"><u>Dominion</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://watchdocumentaries.com/earthlings/\"><u>Earthlings</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://milked.film/watch\"><u>Milked</u></a>, which use music, visuals, interviews, narration and an engaging story to guide the audience through a journey.</p><p>As if by magic however, during the 14 months it took to write this piece,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/how-effective-is-cowspiracy/\"><u>a study was published</u></a> to answer how effective&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cowspiracy.com/\"><u>Cowspiracy</u></a> is. Like with the previous study, viewers of the test-condition documentary did increase the percentage of participants who intended to reduce animal consumption. However, unlike the previous study, the sample size was small, and no mention is made of controlling for social desirability bias.</p><p>This brings us on to the thorny issue around measuring: ultimately, advocates care about reducing animal consumption (to zero), but this is difficult to measure accurately and over long enough timescales. However, if we also care about the spread in the&nbsp;<i>ideas</i> of veganism, since a spread in ideas can affect substantial change without affecting an individual\u2019s behaviour (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Gmztp2hWEctnAKg87#Social_Change_Dynamics\"><u>Social Change Dynamics</u></a>), then results such as the above are sufficient evidence to demonstrate that something of value is happening via this medium.</p><p>Perhaps documentaries are more suited to be a hits-based approach than measuring-based; this seems to be the conclusion of an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://us14.campaign-archive.com/?u=66df320da8400b581cbc1b539&amp;id=2e280c0c22\"><u>Open Phil Animal Welfare Research Note from Feb 2020</u></a>. It also concludes that the production value of a documentary correlates with its success, especially with regards to making it onto major streaming platforms, though not necessarily successful enough to offset the increased (and varying) costs.</p><p><strong>There is another, advantageous and often overlooked, aspect of documentary impact which could be cheaper to support: promotion.</strong> At its end, the newsletter says:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cDocumentarians tend to understandably focus on financing the film\u2019s production, leaving few resources to promote it. Funders and activists focused on promotion have two advantages: (a) they can see whether the film turned out well before getting involve, and (b) they can focus exclusively on amplifying the film\u2019s impact.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>It uses&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eatinganimalsmovie.com\"><i><u>Eating Animals</u></i></a> as an example; I would have reached for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U5hGQDLprA8\"><u>Gary Yourofsky\u2019s famous speech</u></a>, and its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kinderworld.org/about-us/\"><u>promotion campaign within Israel</u></a>. Astonishingly, this was overlooked by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/lewis-bollard-big-wins-against-factory-farming/#animal-advocacy-in-emerging-countries-013444\"><u>Bollard when asked about the explosion of interest in veganism in Israel</u></a>. The&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.gary-tv.com/garymain/media-coverage/media-coverage-in-israel/\"><u>popularity of Gary\u2019s speech in Israel</u></a> at the time is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/food/articles/life-after-brisket\"><u>well-documented</u></a> and the campaign itself was simply two people who translated and shared the video on social media. Promotion campaigns are within the remit of EA (the promotion of What We Owe The Future) and are still useful for animal advocacy (the promotion of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/444658/this-is-vegan-propaganda-by-winters-ed/9781785043765\"><u>This is Vegan Propaganda by Ed Winters</u></a>).</p><p>This oversight highlights the importance of remembering that the cultural downstream effects of documentaries are numerous and not (yet, or easily) captured by the above discussions: people involved in the documentaries get interviewed, news articles get written about the issue, excerpts can be clipped and remixed into easily shareable content online, new activists are created, and existing activists have easily accessible content to point interested people towards. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://osf.io/7q5uk/\"><u>legacy (2014) report</u></a> based on a large-scale (N=3000) survey said&nbsp;<i>\u201cExposure to documentaries and books are two of the biggest catalysts inspiring people to reduce or eliminate animal product consumption.\u201d</i>. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/animal-advocacy-in-the-u-s-canada-advocate-origins/\"><u>2020 Faunalytics study</u></a> of the origins of animal activists in the U.S.A. and Canada (N=161) found that 37% became involved because of exposure to media (13% documentaries, 10% books).</p><p>It\u2019s also worth remembering that documentaries are not the only form of media. Things like public advertising (<a href=\"https://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/PO2111/S00043/local-documentary-milked-unveils-billboards-awarding-nz-dairy-the-prize-for-1-polluter.htm\"><u>billboards</u></a>, social media content/ads<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrng7igz7thc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrng7igz7thc\">[3]</a></sup></span>), short films,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3n8vezjhonu\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3n8vezjhonu\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;books, paintings, poetry, street-art, etc. also have a cultural impact. Of course their impact is hard to measure, but it\u2019s probably doable - I\u2019m confident that somewhere in McDonald\u2019s, someone\u2019s estimated how many times someone needs to see an ad for a McPlant before buying one. Perhaps as with documentaries, it\u2019s not the production of such content, but amplifying its reach which would be an effective action to take.&nbsp;<strong>One potentially useful idea would be to improve the inconsistent enforcement of advertising standards in a given country, which seems to scrutinise&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/tesco-stores-ltd-g21-1128264-tesco-stores-ltd.html\"><strong><u>plant-based</u></strong></a><strong> and&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.asa.org.uk/rulings/vegan-friendly-uk-g22-1148327-vegan-friendly-uk.html\"><strong><u>vegan</u></strong></a><strong> advertising&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/iusGoaolNwg\"><strong><u>far more than carnist ones</u></strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><h1>Rights-based Legal Actions</h1><p>The case for welfare law improvements are understood and widely accepted within effective animal advocacy<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref98n28hk137g\"><sup><a href=\"#fn98n28hk137g\">[5]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref65mu5x1dif\"><sup><a href=\"#fn65mu5x1dif\">[6]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflkm0uudey1k\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlkm0uudey1k\">[7]</a></sup></span>; they are (somewhat) tractable because of their incremental nature and affect a large number of animals, thus considered cost-effective. However the case for animal rights laws don\u2019t seem to get too much attention (<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/the-nonhuman-rights-project/\"><u>anymore</u></a>). To be clear, this is not to say the community should pursue the latter over the former, but a case for balance.</p><p>Apart from working to grant specific species habeas corpus in specific (usually high-income) countries<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefarueogqgak\"><sup><a href=\"#fnarueogqgak\">[8]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreflj3dmj52r6p\"><sup><a href=\"#fnlj3dmj52r6p\">[9]</a></sup></span>, there seems to be a path towards changing the legal status of non-human animals to persons, thus granting them rights, at the international level too.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/toward-international-animal-rights/\"><u>Dr. Anne Peters has argued</u></a> that the international legal order is flexible enough for it to become a promising target for animal advocates, while the globalisation of animal exploitation through international supply chains increases the potential importance of international animal rights law (to prevent displacement). She argues that in the space of international law, a rights-based approach (requiring positive justification for any interference in the lives of animals) would be more effective than a welfarist one. And, as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/22409717/animal-rights-welfare-vegetarian-vegan-animal-law\"><u>Dr. Garett Broad points out</u></a>, this does not necessarily mean an all-or-nothing approach, arguing for an&nbsp;<i>incremental approach to rights</i>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyxcg1vkahw9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyxcg1vkahw9\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Some smart work here could also make things easier for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DgS5oRvWqaTJX3EdD#Learning_Tactics_for_Moral_Circle_Expansion\"><u>moral circle expanders in the future</u></a>.</p><p>As an aside: I came across&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/ojls/gqab013\"><u>a very interesting paper</u></a> which concluded that&nbsp;<i>\u201cthere is no in-principle reason to support the censure of racist hate speech but not the censure of speciesist hate speech.\u201d</i>. If so, could this be a useful line of advocacy to pursue, perhaps with regards to advertising standards as mentioned before?</p><h1>Street Outreach</h1><p>Street outreach is an old-school tactic that has seen some smart and effective&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.anonymousforthevoiceless.org/\"><u>upgrades in recent years</u></a>, enough to warrant investigation. Having taken part in 50+ hours of such actions myself, I have seen first-hand the sort of effect it can have. Of course, a sceptic may fairly accuse me of bias, but perhaps they will be persuaded to continue reading based on what&nbsp;<a href=\"https://veganstrategist.org/2018/07/16/thoughts-on-the-cube-of-truth-and-anonymous-for-the-voiceless/\"><u>arch-pragmatist Tobias Leenaert has to say on the matter</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cMy impressions of the one Cube I attended in Berlin were&nbsp;<strong>largely positive</strong>. I was rather impressed with how I heard the outreachers talk to the onlookers. Most were not pushy. They were asking questions and listening [...] outreachers only approach people who have been watching for a while, and will not bother with those who just walk by and seem not to be open for any conversation [...] I can definitely see some&nbsp;<strong>very positive aspects to this kind of activism</strong> [...] it seems to be very successful in attracting new activists\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>Leenaert then goes on to list concerns and suggestions, which I address (implicitly) later.</p><p>To keep things concrete, in this section, I will only discuss street outreach in the form of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.anonymousforthevoiceless.org/what-is-a-cube-of-truth\"><u>AV Cubes</u></a> and similar derivatives<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6qok3i4voxt\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6qok3i4voxt\">[11]</a></sup></span>, and use the term \u2018cube\u2019 generically rather than specifically AV Cubes. There are other forms of street outreach, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.veganfoodandliving.com/features/vegan-chalk-challenge/\"><u>chalking</u></a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/GNz0NViSuD0\"><u>\u2018change-my-mind\u2019 conversations</u></a>, but I\u2019ll focus on cubes because I think they strike a good balance on many points such as: ease of getting started for activists, number of people outreached, engagement from public and low-ongoing costs</p><p>(Something that I wish to mention in passing is that street outreach is a great opportunity to explore principles of moral circle expansion strategies: my experience with this translated surprisingly well for me and my local One for the World university society.)</p><h2>What are cubes and their variations?</h2><p><strong>The essence of a cube is a combination of two things: street-theatre and targeted, structured outreaching.</strong> These things distinguish it from various (and from my experience, comparatively pointless) forms of street outreach such as leafleting or gathering signatures. It is important to note that conversations tend to be short and polite: whilst extended, confrontational arguments make videos go viral, they are (thankfully) not representative of the typical case.</p><p><strong>Street-theatre serves to draw a crowd; one that is self-selected to be interested and available for conversation.</strong> In the case of cubes, it\u2019s usually people standing in a formation, dressed consistently, wearing some sort of masks, holding screens (TVs work best) displaying legal and standard practice, RSPCA/blue-tick certified footage of farms and slaughterhouses. If there are enough people, or not enough screens, some will hold a sign instead. Sometimes emotionally charged recorded or live music is also used. Sometimes there will also be an information table in the background.</p><p><strong>Targeted, structured outreach serves to deliver the message in a timely manner without emotionally-draining the outreacher.</strong> Only members of the public who stop and watch for a little while are approached. Conversations need only be a few minutes long and, with a bit of experience, follow a rhythm that whilst feeling natural to the public, is actually quite standardised. Whilst many assume talking to strangers to be difficult, because of the (lack of) context, it is a lot easier than talking to colleagues, friends, or family. Outreachers advocate for elimination using an abolitionist, animal-centric message, acknowledging and redirecting away from self-interested arguments.&nbsp;</p><p>(Very briefly, as mentioned before, this is justifiable because&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Gmztp2hWEctnAKg87#Advocating_for_Reduction_Instead_of_Elimination\"><u>advocating for elimination</u></a> is not conclusively worse or better than advocating for reduction (based on the current evidence), the stronger request requires justification and keeps conversations going, and using an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Gmztp2hWEctnAKg87#Advocating_Using_an_Animal_centric_Message\"><u>animal-centric message</u></a> is a comparative advantage for animal advocates and may lead to stronger motivations.)</p><p>Whilst common objections to such an ask and their responses are finite, oft-repeated and well-known (or easily learnable), the aim is to&nbsp;<i>structure conversations</i>&nbsp;<i>such that they do not turn into a debate in the first place</i>, and having well-defined exit points when dealing with disingenuous people. Such a structure has been refined over multiple years<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefup6bwz0x54s\"><sup><a href=\"#fnup6bwz0x54s\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;to streamline onboarding new activists;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/-nznQXhXgMY\"><u>my favourite version</u></a> (well worth a watch) is easily explained within 17 minutes, and more detailed versions take&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/rIr0Tj5MEo8\"><u>one</u></a> or at most&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/hBwK4iWU0b8\"><u>two</u></a> hours to deliver. The structure is based on the premise that most&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2022.101871\"><u>avoiding hypocrisy is the key to changing behaviour</u></a>; it is optimised to&nbsp;<strong>politely</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5hqkohjw40l\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5hqkohjw40l\">[13]</a></sup></span><strong>&nbsp;</strong>and efficiently establish that&nbsp;<i>based on their own values</i>, a person\u2019s consuming animals is hypocritical and that veganism is the only acceptable resolution. At that point, an outreacher may walk through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://woopmylife.org/\"><u>WOOP</u></a>-ing going vegan. At the end, the hypocrisy and resolution is summarised back to the person.</p><p>The nice thing about cubes is that there are many axes on which to experiment and test, assessing effectiveness either in attitude change, or in understanding the argument for veganism, or in reduction in animal consumption.</p><ul><li>Footage. Should it be of slaughterhouses, or happy animals at a sanctuary? Or both, either side by side or interleaved?</li><li>Masks. Are they helpful for drawing attention, or off-putting?</li><li>Music.

Do samples of food help reduce cognitive dissonance or distract from the intention?</li><li>Premise. Is avoiding hypocrisy really the key to changing behaviour?</li></ul><p>One very fun way in which cubes can be altered is in the set-up. My favourite examples subvert expectations of the public in different ways.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLNajBxmhu1dPVPwiYZJMw7gIwOxfwkwGg\"><u>One way</u></a> is to have the TVs the same, but a sign underneath saying&nbsp;<i>\u2018Animals deserve to be abused. Prove me wrong.\u2019</i>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/CbdQTatoo8Q\"><u>Another way</u></a> is to have a similar setup, but with a sign saying&nbsp;<i>\u2018Will you sign the petition?</i>\u2019, and when a member of the public goes to the outreacher, they find out that it\u2019s a petition to&nbsp;<i>legalise</i> animal cruelty. Lastly,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/j_Q4b83l-Gw\"><u>a time-efficient way</u></a> I came across uses just three questions to get to the point. Whilst some might be sceptical about these approaches, it\u2019s worth keeping an open mind and seeing (or better yet, trying) them for oneself.</p><h2>Reasons cubes work (cost-effectively)</h2><p><a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/video-outreach-impact-pork-consumption/\"><u>Interventions similar to cubes</u></a> have been tested and found to work before, and this is true of the basic premise that moral discussion and education can change opinions and behaviours (<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/students-eat-less-meat-after-studying-meat-ethics/\"><u>as tested in a university philosophy classroom</u></a>). I conjecture that the effect would be stronger with cubes, because of emotional cues, structured persuasion (rather than discussion) and cognitive-dissonance (which&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvp.2022.101871\"><u>other research has shown to be a powerful tool</u></a>). Whilst one might be worried about backfire effects, that phenomenon&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jarmac.2020.06.006\"><u>has had trouble being replicated, and needs more robust evidence to deny or confirm it</u></a>.</p><p>Given we have good reasons to believe that cubes work, the next question is about cost-effectiveness. Whilst&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9ShnvD6Zprhj77zD8/animal-equality-showed-that-advocating-for-diet-change-works#How_should_we_cautiously_interpret_these_results_\"><u>prior work is pessimistic</u></a> on that, the AV-model addresses some of the shortcomings of the strategy they tested. First off, the most expensive factor in their estimates is staff costs, which the&nbsp;<strong>AV-model of supporting and connecting local volunteer-led chapters would make substantially cheaper</strong>. Thus the intervention would be&nbsp;<i><strong>encouraging&nbsp;</strong></i><strong>(with logistics, community, and financial support)&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>vegans to get involved with this</strong></i><strong>, rather than paying professionals to do so full-time</strong>. Secondly, they focused only on pigs, which could lead to a smaller impact: in roughly the same amount of time, an outreacher can argue for all animals (I acknowledge that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/lessons-learned-study-with-animal-equality/\"><u>there is a tradeoff here</u></a>, and am not criticising them for measuring as they did). Thirdly, it\u2019s not clear the extent to which structured persuasion and cognitive-dissonance were used.</p><h1>Increasing Plant-based Food &amp; Education</h1><p>Campaigns for more plant-based food are not as straightforward as one may hope: there\u2019s a catch-22 situation, where caterers think that people don\u2019t want such options, and people don\u2019t take such options if there\u2019s not enough of them. Fortunately,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/supply-and-demand-does-more-visibility-of-veg-options-increase-sales/\"><u>this has been tested</u></a> and the results are promising:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cdoubling vegetarian meal availability from 25% to 50% did result in a 41% increase in vegetarian meal sales [...] total sales were not affected [...] there was no \u201crebound effect.\u201d [...] simply offering more vegetarian meals can increase vegetarian meal consumption and decrease meat consumption.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>Another way around this is to lean into campaigns such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://veganuary.com/\"><u>Veganuary</u></a> (and similar things such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://challenge22.com/\"><u>challenge22</u></a>). There is a consensus around the intuition that such campaigns are a good thing,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2hrnjtnbgz\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2hrnjtnbgz\">[14]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefod4atbzdto\"><sup><a href=\"#fnod4atbzdto\">[15]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;but&nbsp;<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/research/research-briefs/what-is-the-effect-of-institutional-outreach-on-the-availability-of-animal-free-products/\"><u>little rigorous analysis on how much so, or research into improving it</u></a>.

It is intended to be a big-picture piece, surfacing and investigating common beliefs within EA animal advocacy. Necessarily, I deal with generalisations of views, which will not cover all variations, organisations, or advocates.</p><h1>Introduction</h1><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/wtQ3XCL35uxjXpwjE/ea-survey-2019-series-community-demographics-and#Morality\"><u>Effective Altruism is dominated by people who subscribe to utilitarianism</u></a>, and so given that welfarist interventions are easier to argue as increasing utility than abolitionist interventions, their approaches to animal advocacy tend to be dominated by welfarist thinking.&nbsp;<strong>Note that&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/u55MrNS3xvD4pf34m/jeff-sebo-a-utilitarian-case-for-animal-rights\"><strong><u>this does not mean abolitionist interventions are incompatible with utilitarianism</u></strong></a><strong>, it just means that measuring their effectiveness has to be creative and appropriate (see&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Gmztp2hWEctnAKg87#Social_Change_Dynamics\"><strong><u>Social Change Dynamics</u></strong></a><strong>).</strong></p><p>Measurability is not the only approach on the table though:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/hits-based-giving/\"><u>hit-based approaches are also a valid strategy</u></a> (more frequently used in longtermist cause areas). However, hits-based abolitionist approaches require some intuition/belief that an abolitionist idea&nbsp;<i>could&nbsp;</i>work. To my (perhaps naive) surprise, discussions with animal advocates at EA Global London 2022 or Charity Entrepreneurship social evenings, there was near-universal dismissal of&nbsp;<i>calls to investigate</i> the ideas in this post (cultural advocacy in LMICs, the value and best strategies of smart outreach, farmer transition policies). Nearly all simply thought&nbsp;<i>these ideas were not worth investigating</i>, but when asked for reasons why (I actively proposed these ideas to get feedback for this post), I either did not get any, or got politely&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.plantinghappiness.co.uk/intuition-jousting/\"><u>intuition jousted</u></a>. Of course, my experience is just that, and may not be reflective of EA as a whole. But if it is, I believe the current situation has led EAs to ignore possibly effective tactics and to under-research certain promising approaches to animal advocacy.</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/59NyMXxwn5pXFRsdh\">I\u2019ve already discussed</a> the three types of approaches EA Animal Advocacy deems to be effective. In this piece, we examine the objections to the following, deemed to be ineffective.</p><ul><li>Influencing social &amp; political opinion.</li><li>Individual outreach.</li><li>Advocating for elimination (of animal-product consumption) rather than reduction.</li><li>Advocating using an animal-centric message (rather than broad appeal, \u2018safer\u2019 messages like health, environment or taste).</li></ul><p>I think that, in all of these cases, the evidence that these strategies are ineffective is at best weak.</p><h1>Influencing Social &amp; Political Opinion</h1><h2>Sentience Institute Report</h2><p>Strategies which seek to influence social/political opinion are deemed ineffective (when it comes to animal advocacy,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/kurzgesagt-video-creation-and-translation/\"><u>but not for longtermism</u></a>), based on studies of other issues as mentioned in this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/public-opinion\"><u>Sentience Institute report</u></a>.</p><p>As far as I understand, the report is intended to answer the question \u2018Is influencing social/political opinion a worthwhile goal in general, and what makes it work or fail?\u2019 rather than \u2018Is influencing social/political opinion a worthwhile goal for animal advocates?\u2019. As such, I do not wish to say the report argues one way or another, or criticise it for not doing so. What I am doing is merely pointing out three ways in which applying the report\u2019s findings to animal advocacy is premature.</p><ol><li>We do not know the cost-effectiveness of the interventions studied<i>.</i> Perhaps the effect size is small, but the relatively scalable nature of some methods still make it worthwhile.</li><li>We do not know whether the evidence and conclusions apply to the issue of animal advocacy, which is different in many important respects.</li><li>The&nbsp;<i>strategies used&nbsp;</i>for other issues are not the only ones used by abolitionist animal advocates, and can differ significantly.</li></ol><p>I expand on the latter two points below.</p><p>Animal advocacy is different from other issues in a number of ways. Animals cannot speak for themselves, cannot tell their own stories. Animals are relevant to all humans. Eliminating animal agriculture has multiple benefits for humans (pollution reduction, soil erosion, climate change, pandemic risk reduction, antibiotic resistance reduction, and health benefits) and so advocates have self-interest across multiple issues as an additional line of attack. Compared to other topics, the case for eliminating animal agriculture is simple and clear. Finally, as I discuss in the next section on individual outreach, animal advocacy is a uniquely economic moral emergency. It\u2019s not clear to me whether the sum of these differences makes influencing social/political opinion on animal agriculture more or less difficult, hence I wish to see more research around this specifically.</p><p>When it comes to strategies themselves, the report says&nbsp;<i>\u201cMany of these effects come from studies using only short messages in artificial contexts, so they may not be very informative about the effects we should expect from real-world advocacy contexts. More extensive interactions (e.g. a lengthy conversation, a documentary, a book) or repeated exposure to similar arguments (e.g. via shifts in media coverage, discussed below) may have larger effects.\u201d</i>&nbsp; This points to a significant problem of \u2018basketballism\u2019 (the parable from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/8xLtE3BwgegJ7WBbf/is-rationalist-self-improvement-real\"><u>this post</u></a>), where the interventions that are studied happen over too short a time scale to make changes. Abolitionists tend to focus on long-term behavioural change that requires \u2018deep\u2019 discussions, which are difficult to study (<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streetlight_effect\"><u>streetlight effect</u></a>).</p><p>The report does consider this issue extremely briefly, by comparison with health behaviour interventions, saying they \u201ctend to have small or very small effect sizes\u201d<i>,&nbsp;</i>based on studies using \u201cmore realistic interventions, such as lessons conducted over a number of weeks in schools or large-scale mass media campaigns visible to the general public\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, the issue here is that this is not a like-for-like comparison of strategies. Effects of health behaviour interventions are more likely to be independent rather interdependent (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Gmztp2hWEctnAKg87#Social_Change_Dynamics\"><u>Social Change Dynamics</u></a>). Furthermore, \u2018deep canvassing\u2019 is much closer to the actual strategies of abolitionist campaigners (from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/2t6GSSRdcI0\"><u>local</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/n80d69i-gig\"><u>ones</u></a>, to more famous ones like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/Qhz4l53hNtU\"><u>Earthling Ed</u></a>) than the limited, \u2018surface\u2019 outreach that the report discusses, and there&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/2020/1/29/21065620/broockman-kalla-deep-canvassing\"><u>does exist limited evidence</u></a> for it. This suggests that in-depth, focussed, respectful discussions really can change minds, at least some of the time and under certain conditions (most studied in the context of trans rights outreach). In other words: the research that EA draws upon to dismiss abolitionist approaches doesn\u2019t actually take seriously the&nbsp;<i>way</i> abolitionists campaign (see also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@harrisonnathan/can-advocacy-research-involve-abolitionists-68eeb1018bb9\"><u>this post</u></a>).</p><h2>Protests and Disruptive Actions</h2><p>Another major topic when it comes to social/political opinion is direct action and protests. Opinions differ on this, since measuring the effectiveness of such actions is difficult.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/the-challenges-of-researching-animal-advocacy-protests/\"><u>A recent (2022) Faunalytics report</u></a> weakly recommends against protest, arguing the effect on people\u2019s behaviour is negative at worst, and neutral at best. It tempers this recommendation by adding that they only looked at \u201ctwo studies, of which one used self-reported data and the other relied upon exploratory analyses\u201d and called for replication/additional research. In contrast,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4ez3nvEmozwPwARr9/a-case-for-nonviolent-protest\"><u>this report</u></a> argues that XR protests in the UK were effective using a \u2018many weak pieces of evidence\u2019 approach, and the same authors in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/effective-advocacy-for-animals-through-protest/\"><u>different piece</u></a>, provide suggestions on what factors make a protest more effective.</p><p>Both reports agree that protests are more effective when the majority agrees with the cause, but seem to say little about how (if not with raising awareness through such actions) a society gets to that point.</p><p>Disruptive actions are rarely discussed and easily dismissed, due to concerns about the backfire effect (which is also a commonly held fear about protests or outreach). We note here that the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jarmac.2020.06.006\"><u>\u2018backfire effect\u2019 has had trouble being replicated, and needs more robust evidence to deny or confirm it</u></a>.&nbsp;On the contrary, there is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jamesozden.substack.com/p/whats-everyone-got-against-throwing\"><u>reasonable research</u></a> that indicates&nbsp;<i>\u201ca nonviolent radical flank is likely to help, not hinder, a social movement\u201d</i>. Such actions are difficult to evaluate in terms of effectiveness: an evaluation would have all the complexities associated with evaluating the effectiveness of protests,&nbsp;and additionally the need to take into account rises in the costs of production, because of increases in insurance premiums and security costs.&nbsp;</p><p>It is entirely possible that protests and direct action fit better in a hits-based approach rather than a measurement based one. With this model, the emphasis wouldn\u2019t be on the specifics such as messaging, inclusivity, degree of disruption but merely on scale/number of attendees and the media amplification of the&nbsp;<i>intended&nbsp;</i>messages. In 2019 in the UK,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://metro.co.uk/2019/08/18/record-12000-vegan-activists-take-part-london-animal-rights-march-10591790/\"><u>more than 12,000 people attended an animal rights march</u></a>, which attracted some media attention, compared to 2021 and 2022 at which turnout was much smaller (not advertised by EA organisations) and did not attract media attention. By this metric,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/JENcpvlBYCI\"><u>small scale disruptive protests which make the news and enable a few minutes of airtime of key talking points</u></a> (and increasingly,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/Sl5GpxLXnuI\"><u>fair</u></a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/k8FjXe1yn_s\"><u>sympathetic</u></a> ways) could be far more cost-effective.</p><h2>Social Change Dynamics</h2><p>This part is based on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@harrisonnathan/the-actual-number-is-almost-surely-higher-92c908f36517#9b47\"><u>section 6 in Harrison Nathan\u2019s 2016 essay</u></a>; which is worth reading for its discussion of \u201cfoot-in-the-door\u201d vs \u201cdoor-in-the-face\u201d request techniques, descriptive vs injunctive norms, and independent vs interdependent actions.</p><p>(Nathan also notes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/blog/social-movements-research-project/\"><u>ACE\u2019s omission</u></a> of extant literature or experts on the subject, which led me to check whether there were any such omissions from the SI report: Whilst SI has discussed its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/social-movement-case-studies-methodology\"><u>methodology</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/how-is-SI-research-different\"><u>how and why it differs</u></a>, I did not find any reference to the theory of interdependent behaviours or social change dynamics.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbwee6vz3ixm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbwee6vz3ixm\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Nor did I find any reference to the books<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref013x99vh5ogip\"><sup><a href=\"#fn013x99vh5ogip\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Nathan mentioned on the aforementioned links, or their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/public-opinion\"><u>public opinion report</u></a>.)</p><p>My contributions here are drawing out the implications of this on (1) the theory of change for and (2) measurement. But before that, I need to briefly explain independent vs interdependent actions. An independent action (the example used is better nutrition) has a close (linear) correlation between attitude and behaviour. An interdependent action (the example used is community toilet usage) is one which is non-linearly (symmetric sigmoidally)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcu6vnoe24t\"><sup><a href=\"#fncu6vnoe24t\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;correlated. The&nbsp;<i>illustrative&nbsp;</i>figures below are from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/282851305_What_are_social_norms_How_are_they_measured\"><i><u>What are social norms? How are they measured?</u></i><u> (Mackie et. al, 2015)</u></a>.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673435031/mirroredImages/Gmztp2hWEctnAKg87/bvaiyeuvpd50kinabwkx.png\"></p><p>It is also worth noting that this is not a purely theoretical/untestable claim. In the graph for interdependent action, behaviour starts to change rapidly when around 80% of the population has been convinced. However, experimental evidence suggests&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/20031/\"><u>\u2018tipping points\u2019 for social change could be as low as 25%</u></a>. More research and replication on this would be extremely useful - for example, how does the difficulty of making a change moderate the size of the tipping point?</p><p><strong>The theory of change here is that it is not (just) increasing the number of vegans, or improving welfare, that will bring about abolition, but&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>a spread in the ideas of veganism</strong></i><strong>.&nbsp;</strong>Slavery ended not because enough people publicly boycotted slave grown goods (though that helped raise awareness) but because the arguments for it were spread far and wide through relentless activism, such that enough of the public and politicians agreed.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrf10gmc0g0m\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrf10gmc0g0m\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Modern examples include&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plantbasednews.org/news/environment/university-stirling-vegan-scotland-uk-first/\"><u>universities</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.livekindly.com/councils-ditching-meat-why/\"><u>city councils around the world electing to add plant-based meal days to schools or improve plant-based catering for climate change or health reasons.</u></a> In these cases, it\u2019s not that all the people involved do something in their own lives about health or climate, it\u2019s that the arguments for doing so have spread to and convinced them.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/attitudes-predicting-behavior-and-change/\"><strong><u>Current assumptions</u></strong></a><strong> around how attitudes relate to behaviour change could thus be systematically biassing against abolitionist approaches.</strong> Furthermore, trying/wanting to evaluate all interventions based on reduction in animal consumption&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/EffectiveAnimalAdvocacy/permalink/2071025063068354/\"><u>places a higher burden of proof</u></a> on attitude-change related strategies.</p><p><strong>With&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1037/pspp0000182\"><strong><u>an appropriate scale</u></strong></a><strong>, researchers could then empirically measure the success of abolitionist outreach versus other tactics, not just by looking solely at reduction in meat consumption, but also taking into account how well people understand/can argue for veganism.</strong> With this information, researchers could even figure out what the required threshold is for groups (like the aforementioned university and city councils) to vote to adopt partly or wholly plant-based catering. Thus advocates do not necessarily need to make everyone vegan, but rather spread the arguments so that decision makers of the future can institute those social changes with less challenge and backlash (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Z2tFtS3azcxT2yyxf#Scaling_Animal_Agriculture_Transitions\"><u>Scaling Animal Agriculture Transitions</u></a>).</p><h1>Individual Outreach</h1><p>The usual argument given for (abolitionist approaches to) individual outreach not working is: if it did, the number of veg*ns in the US would have increased, or per capita meat consumption would have decreased.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0kqg6945bv3\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0kqg6945bv3\">[5]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgn8jqqx40ci\"><sup><a href=\"#fngn8jqqx40ci\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; This is a weak line of argument, for at least three reasons. First is that it doesn\u2019t take into account how much individual outreach was done in the first place (presumably little), and says&nbsp;<i>nothing&nbsp;</i>about the cost<i>-</i>effectiveness of such approaches. Secondly, one could use the same style of argument to say that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_animal_welfare_and_rights\"><u>welfare reforms haven\u2019t achieved anything substantial in the same time period</u></a>. Thirdly, even if it might have been true of the tactics and strategies advocates were using then, that doesn\u2019t entail that the same apply for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Z2tFtS3azcxT2yyxf#Street_Outreach\"><u>ones used&nbsp;</u><i><u>now</u></i></a>, which I show later&nbsp;<i>do work</i>, potentially cost-effectively.</p><p>Individual outreach is also ignored or discounted because it is deemed to be unrealistic/too slow.

Thus, even if individual outreach does not immediately and effectively create behavioural changes, it could be quite cost-effective because it can (a)&nbsp;reduce resistance to institutional changes and (b) create new advocates. An open question in a hits-based approach would be: what can we do to encourage&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.gary-tv.com/garymain/about/about-the-israeli-campaign/\"><u>outlier impactful</u></a> activists like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/U5hGQDLprA8\"><u>Gary Yourofsky</u></a>?</p><p>Another reason why abolitionist approaches to individual outreach are neglected by EA animal advocacy is the idea that abolitionist outreach necessitates an individual messaging and is incompatible with an institutional focus.</p><p>As an example, the Sentience Institute includes as one of its&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/foundational-questions-summaries\"><u>\u2018foundational questions\u2019</u></a> the problem of whether activists should focus&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/foundational-questions-summaries#individual-vs.-institutional-interventions-and-messaging\"><u>\u2018on changing individuals or changing institutions and social norms\u2019</u></a>, and it notes that: \u2018There seems to be significant majority agreement among EAA researchers that an institutional focus is more effective.\u2019 However, they seem to have a rather narrow conception of \u2018individual outreach\u2019 in mind. For example, they write that \u2018[a]n institutional focus might do more to emphasize the victims of animal farming\u2019; but abolitionists focus very clearly on the animal victims of factory farming&nbsp;<i>as part of</i> an argument for personal change. Additionally, some of the listed advantages (reducing defensiveness, shifting blame, motivation to act) are not inherent to having an institutional focus; with the right framing, these can also be achieved when targeting individuals (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Z2tFtS3azcxT2yyxf#Street_Outreach\"><u>Street Outreach</u></a>).</p><p>In the same vein, Jacy Reese Anthis argues against 'individual messaging'<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref58lsiyaz3hy\"><sup><a href=\"#fn58lsiyaz3hy\">[7]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyb51b2k75t\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyb51b2k75t\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp; in animal advocacy.

While Anthis\u2019 arguments against a certain style of individual messaging are pretty convincing, his definition leaves out a wide swathe of animal rights outreach.</p><p>Much of abolitionist-style individual outreach, including but not limited to street outreach and protests, combines the features of \u2018individual\u2019 and \u2018institutional\u2019 messaging as those terms are used in EA: it portrays the problem as systemic and structural, but also tries to create individual-level change. It\u2019s at least somewhat plausible, then, that abolitionist outreach might combine some of the benefits of both; yet it is seemingly not considered at all.</p><p>Whilst an institutional focus is an important part of the animal advocacy movement, it is by no means essential in the same way that it is for other movements.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/gcVR2OVxPYw?t=252\"><u>In the words of Alex O\u2019Connor</u></a>, animal exploitation&nbsp;<i>\u201cis a uniquely economic moral emergency.

It is far more practicable, and so vastly more scalable for people to boycott animal products than to boycott polluting manufacturing materials, polluting electricity, and polluting forms of transport.</p><p>I will readily admit that emphasising individual choices can be a distraction towards ineffective actions for many other issues, this is empirically not true in the case of boycotting animal products. A simple way to determine the distinction is \u201cif everyone did X, would problem Y be eliminated or substantially reduced?\u201d. For X = boycott animal products, and Y = animal exploitation, the answer is \u2018eliminated\u2019, and for Y in {climate change, public health, antimicrobial resistance, zoonotic diseases} the answer is \u2018substantially reduced\u2019.</p><p>Individual choice is a well-defined and unique tool available to the animal advocacy movement.

I welcome research into the second point; my intuitions say that vegans as a group become familiar with more kinds of food, and so do not rely on meat-based substitutes as much as non-vegans. Lastly, the previous subsection\u2019s discussion of studies shows that the assumption that reduction-advocacy is more effective is not based on evidence.</p><p>Not only are the assumptions questionable, but they could be&nbsp;<i>counterproductive.</i></p><p>First is with regard to motivation and goal setting. Though I found&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forusallsite.files.wordpress.com/2019/03/grassian-reductionandveganpromotion-v2.pdf\"><u>one longitudinal (6 months) study about goal setting with a large sample-size (n=1,538)</u></a> (thanks to this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/foundational-questions-summaries#ftnt180\"><u>SI footnote</u></a>), the demographics are skewed towards white university students and the \u201canalysis does not include tests of statistical significance\u201d. Since its key findings do not demonstrate causality, this is an important question to answer with future research.</p><ul><li><i>\u201cThose with the strictest goals (i.e. vegans) were the most likely to be meeting their reduction goals (78%), while meat reducers were the least likely (39%).\u201d</i></li><li><i>\u201cWhile meat reducers were more likely to reduce than not in the first month, the reverse was true afterward, with 54% being temporary reducers at six months, 36% long-term reducers and 10% no longer consuming meat.\u201d</i></li><li><i>\u201cThose in vegan campaigns tended to reduce more and were more likely to exceed their initial reduction goals.\u201d</i></li></ul><p>This is in line with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Faunalytics_Current-Former-Vegetarians_Full-Report.pdf\"><u>much older study from Faunalytics</u></a> which shows lower rates of quitting for vegans (70%) versus vegetarians (86%).Both of these lend credence to the idea that advocates may wish to suggest strict goals so as to take into account imperfect adherence (<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/going-veg-many-paths/\"><u>for new vegans in the US and Canada</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/i-think-therefore-i-am-self-identification-and-vegetarians/\"><u>self-identifying vegetarians in the US</u></a>; I could not find any on how much self-identifying reducetarians actually reduce by - given the vagueness of \u201creducing\u201d, my intuitions suggest that it could be very little in practice, and/or subject to substitution effects).</p><p>The second way in which assumptions underlying the idea of reduction advocacy could be counterproductive is with regards to the spread of&nbsp;<i>veganism as a philosophy</i>, rather than a lifestyle (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Gmztp2hWEctnAKg87#Social_Change_Dynamics\"><u>Social Change Dynamics</u></a>).

My contributions in this section are to point out that as morally driven (and charity funded) advocates, our comparative advantage is to emphasise the moral arguments, and this could be more effective anyway.</p><p>Businesses, in trying to appeal to as many people as possible, are (in the current moral landscape) incentivized to appeal to \u201cflexitarian\u201d sentiments.

Though I\u2019ve discussed how reduction vs elimination has roughly the same&nbsp;<i>quantitative&nbsp;</i>effect, it does not take into account the potential&nbsp;<i>additional duration</i> of elimination, caused by ethical motivations. It would be interesting to measure the effect of&nbsp;<i>preaching to the choir</i>: in the key findings of their 2021 study, Faunalytics reported that exposure to animal advocacy increased the success rate for veg*nism regardless of initial motivation, thus recommending health and environmental vegans are exposed to animal advocacy, and opposing using health messaging alone for veg*n outreach.</p><p>Aside from the reasons of comparative advantage, and extended adherence, there is also historical precedent for advocating using an ethical (in this case, animal-centric) message.

It is intended to be a big-picture piece, surfacing and investigating common beliefs within EA animal advocacy. Necessarily, I deal with generalisations of views, which will not cover all variations, organisations, or advocates.</p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>Current EA animal advocacy has three major strands: corporate welfare campaigns, cultured meat and focusing on high-income countries (HICs). Not only is EA animal advocacy often&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6CDzrSBZCzCvrzQjN/how-to-help-farmed-animals-without-going-vegan-a-happier\"><u>framed this way</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/6H9QGZkdMzDEdKNCX/analysis-of-ea-funding-within-animal-welfare-from-2019-2021-1\"><u>current EA-aligned funding allocations</u></a> favour the first and last, there is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/2SnY4QTZXNibxEjxD/ten-big-wins-for-farm-animals-in-2021#No_Longer_Just_the_Alternative\"><u>significant government and private funding going into the second</u></a> (I recognise that the focus on HICs is changing, and discuss this later).&nbsp;</p><p>I wish to make it clear that the points in this section are only meant to show that these approaches have limitations, and so are (in my opinion) jointly insufficient as a means to end farmed animal suffering. These strategies seem individually necessary, that is they seem to achieve some cost-effective good, and so I am not arguing for them to disappear (their over-valuation may be a result of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pxALB46SEkwNbfiNS/the-motivated-reasoning-critique-of-effective-altruism#Animals\"><u>motivated reasoning</u></a>).</p><p>Therefore, in addition to pointing out the limitations of existing strategies, elsewhere (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Gmztp2hWEctnAKg87\"><u>Scrutinising Objections to (Traditional) Abolitionist Approaches</u></a>), I make the case for a greater diversity of thinking and approaches by responding to criticisms of commonly rejected strategies and proposing arguments for new ones.</p><h1>Corporate Welfare Campaigns</h1><p>As described by Founders Pledge in their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/research/fp-animal-welfare\"><u>report</u></a> on the subject, corporate campaigns \u201cseek to shift corporate practices towards systems that improve animal welfare, employing a variety of strategies, including supporting aligned stakeholders or offering technical assistance, and launching social media campaigns against companies that refuse to engage.\u201d.</p><p>Whilst Founders Pledge conclude that \u201cthe policy shifts championed by corporate campaigns are likely to result in significant welfare improvement for animals\u201d, they mention significant sources of uncertainty with regards to this, including:</p><ul><li>Corporations breaking the pledges they make in corporate campaigns.</li><li>Pledges being used by agribusiness to launder their image, which could indirectly cause more suffering by reducing public concern about animal cruelty.</li><li>Evaluating policy shifts based on a metric defined directly in terms of birds moved from cages to aviaries, not a more generalised metric based on animal suffering.</li><li>Assuming that \u2018all campaigns are equally expensive\u2019, and that past corporate outreach is representative of future outreach, which may not be true due to diminishing returns, corporate consolidation, and the development of new tactics to oppose reform.</li></ul><p>These are not entirely theoretical concerns. In this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/kHdKWmTcS3FfcYAZj/eaa-is-relatively-overinvesting-in-corporate-welfare-reforms?commentId=6GHMrquNhZFfGbLwB\"><u>EA forum post comment</u></a>, the author notes that whilst compliance with cage-free seems to be going well, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://betterchickencommitment.com/policy/\"><u>Better Chicken Commitment</u></a> (BCC) appears to have been watered down, and ensuring compliance is harder in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). We discuss a more generalised metric based on animal suffering later (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/59NyMXxwn5pXFRsdh#Offsetting_Carnivory\"><u>Offsetting Carnivory</u></a>).</p><p>Diminishing returns is a point which deserves more discussion. But before that, it is worth remembering that even if the below points turn out not to be show-stoppers on the road to abolition, the animal agriculture lobby is extremely&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/22379909/big-meat-companies-spend-millions-lobbying-climate\"><u>well-funded</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2021/sep/21/livestock-industry-lobbying-un-to-support-more-meat-production\"><u>experienced</u></a>, so they will make the journey slow and difficult.</p><p>I argued earlier that complete abolition (not just ending factory farming) is an important goal. It is not clear to me how corporate welfare campaigns will lead to abolition. Perhaps they are not intended to do so. However, if that is the intention (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/A49f8hEGMoSmvzSCW/potential-theories-of-change-for-the-animal-advocacy#Heavy_regulation_of_animal_industry\"><u>as implied here</u></a>),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/EffectiveAnimalAdvocacy/posts/1904964536341075\"><u>I was unable to find an explanation of how that will happen</u></a> (either by itself, or as we will discuss later, in conjunction with alternative proteins). Assuming price increases continue (see footnotes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/foundational-questions-summaries#ftnt159\"><u>159&nbsp;</u></a>and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/foundational-questions-summaries#ftnt160\"><u>160</u></a>), I think it is more likely that corporate campaigns will make animal flesh and secretions into a luxury good (to reiterate, though we welcome big reductions in suffering,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DgS5oRvWqaTJX3EdD\"><u>we have our sights set on abolition</u></a>). These luxury goods will be the most difficult to replace with alternative proteins.</p><p>It\u2019s also worth noting that the current definition of progress (reduction in animal production/consumption) is too narrow (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Gmztp2hWEctnAKg87#Social_Change_Dynamics\"><u>Social Change Dynamics</u></a>) and thus may bias towards favouring corporate welfare campaigns which pursue&nbsp;lower-hanging fruit (on an admittedly large scale).</p><h1>Cultured Meat</h1><p>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/A49f8hEGMoSmvzSCW/potential-theories-of-change-for-the-animal-advocacy#Technology_optimistic_scenario\"><u>argument for cultured meat</u></a> (and alternative proteins in general) as a theory of change is that if just-as-good replacements exist, which are the same price or cheaper, (eventually, after it getting worse for a while) animals will stop being farmed for food. I note in passing that making veganism more accessible&nbsp;<a href=\"http://georgestiffman.com/\"><u>does not exclusively mean making meat replacements.</u></a><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkjfyqteaozb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkjfyqteaozb\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;There are two broad flavours of arguments against cultured meat. The first shows that even if cultured meat becomes widely available, it does not solve all animal advocacy problems (nor solve other, related problems). The second questions the feasibility of cultured meat itself.</p><p>Even if cultured meat becomes widely available, its adoption perpetuates carnism (the idea that animal products are normal, natural, nutritionally necessary and nice). As I argued&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DgS5oRvWqaTJX3EdD\"><u>earlier</u></a>, one of the reasons to aim for abolition is to prevent factory farming from re-emerging. Given the advanced technology required to produce cultured meat, and the fact that animals are not susceptible to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_pulse\"><u>EMPs</u></a>, any major disruption of society (e.g. war, solar flares) may cause the society to re-introduce animal agriculture, if carnist beliefs are prevalent.</p><p>(Though not central to this section, or this post, we wish to note the following in passing, whilst we are on the subject. The adoption of cultured meat will be a lot easier to advocate for if its production is significantly better in terms of resource use and health. However, based on the current evidence, neither of these are guaranteed yet. We discuss the resource aspect in the next section, on LMICs. For health, we note that even if it is possible to \u2018modify\u2019 meat to be healthier, there could still be a direct conflict between health and realism/taste:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nutritionfacts.org/video/is-heme-iron-the-reason-meat-is-carcinogenic/\"><u>the research is unclear about the contribution of heme-iron to the carcinogenic nature of animal flesh</u></a>, yet it is precisely that innovation which Impossible patented to improve the look, smell and taste of their burgers.)</p><p>Cultured meat is a long way off replacing structured cuts of meat such as steaks due to the technical difficulties in creating the 3D structure. These structured cuts are often (but not always) the most expensive per kilo (for example, foie gras is unusual in that it is expensive and unstructured).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefy8c7kvt8t9\"><sup><a href=\"#fny8c7kvt8t9\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Perhaps some combination of purpose-designed plants and 3D-printed plant-based meats could suffice for structured meat; we await research and techno-economic analyses on the subject. As it stands, cheaply and widely available cultured meat would only replace low-grade, unstructured animal flesh. Though this would still be a welcome development from an animal suffering perspective, as mentioned before, this would turn animal flesh into a luxury good, rather than abolishing its production altogether.</p><p>However,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thecounter.org/lab-grown-cultivated-meat-cost-at-scale/\"><u>despite widespread belief</u></a>, the two-fold assumption that cultured-meat will be cost-competitive and widely available is quite optimistic, in two senses.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/YYurNqQDAWNiQJv9K/cultured-meat-predictions-were-overly-optimistic\"><u>First is in the sense that most predictions about cultured meat have resolved negatively, because they were too optimistic.</u></a> This suggests&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/2b9HCjTiFnWM8jkRM/forecasts-estimate-limited-cultured-meat-production-through\"><u>these technologies will not be ready in time</u></a> to mitigate the rise of factory farming in LMICs (see the section on LMICs for why this is an important consideration).</p><p><i>Of the 273 predictions collected, 84 have resolved - nine resolving correctly, and 75 resolving incorrectly. Additionally, another 40 predictions should resolve at the end of the year and look to be resolving incorrectly. Overall, the state of these predictions suggest very systematic overconfidence. Cultured meat seems to have been perpetually just a few years away since as early as 2010 and this track record plausibly should make us skeptical of future claims from producers that cultured meat is just a few years away.</i></p><p>Second is in the sense that there are hard, technical problems and biological limitations within which cultured meat production problems must be solved, not to mention a sense of urgency that this needs to happen soon. Whilst&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/y8jHKDkhPXApHp2gb/cultured-meat-a-comparison-of-techno-economic-analyses?commentId=MJtLFZya2WqdNADSy\"><u>first-principle reasoning may sway some to think that not growing the rest of a moving animal is a thermodynamic slam-dunk</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HUtUBpRbNnnWBxiO2bz3LumEsQcaZioAPZDNcsWPnos/edit\"><u>evolution is extremely hard to outdo</u></a> (big thanks to this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/y8jHKDkhPXApHp2gb/cultured-meat-a-comparison-of-techno-economic-analyses?commentId=jFrauXddCSYbQevSd\"><u>commenter</u></a> for sharing that analysis). For example, one the \u201cunnecessary\u201d parts of the animal that is not being grown, is the immune system, and so any bioreactor contamination will result in a spoiled batch. At the same time, industrial scale production and efficiency will require large bioreactors, failures of which would increase costs.</p><p>The problem of bioreactor contamination is just one of many other obstacles highlighted in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/y8jHKDkhPXApHp2gb/cultured-meat-a-comparison-of-techno-economic-analyses\"><u>this comparison of techno-economic analyses (TEAs)</u></a>, which mean that it is not clear, at this point, how cultivated meat (a) will be mass produced (b) will be cheaper than plant-based or animal-based low quality meat. Even if cultured or plant-based meats hit price-parity, we would still need consumers to buy such products&nbsp;<i>instead&nbsp;</i>of animal-based ones, and extant research indicates that consumers buy alternative proteins&nbsp;<i>in addition&nbsp;</i>to animal-based ones (see summaries&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/EffectiveAnimalAdvocacy/posts/2030261760478018/\"><u>here</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thebreakthrough.org/blog/alt-meat-prices-beef-and-emissions\"><u>here</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><h1>Low- and Middle-Income Countries</h1><p>The intersection of global development and animal wellbeing is an important one, theoretically and pragmatically, but has received remarkably little attention within Effective Altruism.</p><p>One only needs to establish a few facts to appreciate the importance of this intersection.</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://desapublications.un.org/publications/world-population-prospects-2019-highlights\"><u>\u201cWith a projected addition of over one billion people, countries of sub-Saharan Africa could account for more than half of the growth of the world\u2019s population between 2019 and 2050\u201d.</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://desapublications.un.org/publications/world-population-prospects-2019-highlights\"><u>\u201cThe 47 least developed countries are among the world\u2019s fastest growing \u2013 many are projected to double in population between 2019 and 2050\u201d.</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production#meat-consumption-tends-to-rise-as-we-get-richer\"><u>Animal consumption tends to rise as humans get richer</u></a>.</li></ol><p>Philosophical analysis of this issue is sparse (searching the EA forum for posts mentioning both \u201cglobal poverty\u201d and \u201canimal advocacy\u201d in early 2022 yielded nothing obvious about the conflict between the two), with the most comprehensive treatment done by <a href=\"http://www.plantinghappiness.co.uk\">Michael Plant</a> in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://dx.doi.org/10.35995/jci02020002\"><u>The Meat Eater Problem</u></a>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhwg6c7zw5j\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhwg6c7zw5j\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Plant argues that donations to human-oriented EA charities might increase the consumption of animal products (people live longer or become richer and so go on to consume more meat, dairy, and eggs); this of course requires animal suffering; and so saving lives might in fact be a net negative in utilitarian terms.

First considers production within California (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/ajae/aax049\"><u>Mullally and Lusk - 2017,</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.zachgroff.com/2017/11/animal-welfare-reforms-are-looking.html\"><u>commentary</u></a>). The paper finds that&nbsp;<i>\u201cby July 2016, both egg production and the number of egg-laying hens were about 35% lower than they would have been in the absence of the new regulations\u201d</i>, and the commentary states this means&nbsp;<i>\u201c10 million fewer birds are in production in California in a typical month because of the law\u201d</i> (though it\u2019s not clear to me how this number was derived: 35% reduction of the roughly 19 million hens in California should mean around 6.7 million fewer).</p><p>However, the second piece of evidence for the counterfactual decrease in total and \u2018conventional\u2019 flock size calls this into question, by looking at the impact outside of California (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/ajae.12104\"><u>Carter, Schaefer &amp; Scheitrum, 2016</u></a>). The important figure in this paper is Figure 6,&nbsp;<i>Impact of California legislation on flock size in rest of U.S.</i>:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673435031/mirroredImages/Gmztp2hWEctnAKg87/gmbzhi9jthsvn5bf4w8i.png\"></p><p>As the paper notes, the total flock size was \u2018only slightly\u2019 smaller than their predictions in the rest of the U.S., with a difference of 7 million fewer hens by the end of 2016. Unfortunately, this cannot be entirely attributed to California Prop 2: there was an avian flu outbreak in 2015, and the sharp decrease in numbers represents a cull to control it, which the modelling does not take into account. Put differently, the prediction is based on both (a) Prop 2 not being enacted and (b) the avian flu outbreak not having occurred. So even though the flock was considered to have \u2018recovered\u2019 by then and the number lines up with the aforementioned reduction in Californian layer hens, it\u2019s hard to rule out or subtract the effects of the cull. It would be useful to see the modelling run a few more years forward to the present day (2022) and see if the total flock size remains smaller than predictions.</p><p>A clearer result is the narrow gap (between the \u2018conventional\u2019 and cage-free flock size) widening significantly, which eyeballing suggests a difference of 33 million by 2018. Given that cage-free is stricter than California Prop 2, the real number of hens with more space could be much larger (the \u2018conventional\u2019 numbers include Prop 2 compliant hens which are not cage-free).</p><p>The effect of California Prop 2 is maybe good in terms of lives prevented, and is probably a net positive on welfare.

If welfarist approaches are subject to diminishing marginal returns (see our section on Corporate Welfare Campaigns) and abolitionist approaches are not (see our section on Unexplored Abolitionist Approaches), then that would push advocates&nbsp;<i>very</i> strongly towards abolitionist approaches -&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/articles/problem-framework/\"><u>even if tractability is low, the scale is so high it\u2019s still a crucial problem</u></a>.</p><p>If welfarist approaches lead only to a reduction of (or higher-welfare) animal farming, there is a risk that, we may get stuck at a point where a large part of the population perceives animal agriculture as \u2018humane\u2019, and/or still holds on to a speciesist worldview, and does not have the motivation to abolish animal exploitation entirely. Consequently, focusing on welfare improvements could end factory farming sooner, but delay abolition for a very long time, ultimately affecting more individuals. The gravity of such a risk is then compounded by considerations of wild animal suffering.</p><p>In contrast, as well as hastening or helping bring about abolition, abolitionist approaches may also be better suited to&nbsp;<i>prevent factory farming from re-emerging</i> if abolished. I suspect that in emergency situations (barely surviving an existential catastrophe), a strong moral culture against exploiting animals would make it less likely for society to resume animal exploitation, especially factory farming.</p><h1>Wild Animal Suffering (WAS)</h1><p>It is well-established that suffering in the wild, on all expectations, dominates all other forms of suffering, and so from a longtermist perspective WAS is more important than farmed animal suffering. However, WAS is beyond the limits of our current moral circle and social acceptance. Furthermore, there is psychological evidence&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4xzayvvbfk3\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4xzayvvbfk3\">[7]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnainz4lt2wc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnainz4lt2wc\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;that eating meat reduces empathy for animals. It may be that giving up animal products in general, especially when accompanied with the adoption of a non-speciesist worldview, will have greater psychological effects in terms of extending empathy to wild animals. Hence, it may become far easier to attract support for efforts to reduce WAS if abolition is achieved. While strict veganism might not be necessary for this, it seems intuitively unlikely that eating only high-welfare animals would have the same psychological effect as giving up meat entirely. In other words, even though taking WAS may not depend physically, on abolishing all animal farming, it plausibly depends on it psychologically - a claim which can be tested empirically.</p><p>Such thinking is in conflict with a view put forward by Brian Tomasik, who&nbsp;<a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/vegetarianism-and-wild-animals/\"><u>has argued</u></a> that when we take WAS into account, certain types of animal agriculture like grass-fed beef production might be a net positive in terms of total animal suffering, because they reduce the number of wild animals in such areas. However, Tomasik\u2019s argument relies on the claim that most wild animals live \u2018net negative\u2019 lives, a claim which has been disputed&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7w5lm2v7h8e\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7w5lm2v7h8e\">[9]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3awrboq4obs\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3awrboq4obs\">[10]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;<strong>Above all, the argument also presents a false dichotomy between natural ecosystems and cattle farming; it would also be possible to have pastures without growing animals to slaughter them, or simply to have humans live on the land.</strong></p><p>While a focus on WAS and farmed animal welfare&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/foundational-questions-summaries#[meta]-farmed-animal-vs.-wild-animals-vs.-general-antispeciesism-focus\"><u>can be seen to conflict</u></a>, a focus on&nbsp;<i>non-speciesism</i> implicitly supports both. However, taking non-speciesism seriously points towards abolitionism. Advocating for welfare improvements arguably perpetuates speciesist ideas (that animal interests or rights matter less), and thereby undermines, or at least does not support, efforts to reduce WAS.</p><h1>Learning Tactics for Moral Circle Expansion</h1><p>Lastly, I note that in the wait/absence of a techno-fix, researchers actually have a good opportunity to study and collect data for moral circle expansion. Such information might be quite useful preparation for advocating for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/4/4/18285986/robot-animal-nature-expanding-moral-circle-peter-singer\"><u>inclusion of robots and/or aliens in our moral circles</u></a>, further reducing another type of s-risk.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/blog/longtermism-and-animal-farming-trajectories\"><u>A recently published (Dec 2022) Sentience Institute blog post</u></a> arrived at a similar conclusion independently, and goes into more detail about potential counter-arguments too.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cWaiting for technology to end animal farming may set a dangerous precedent for scenarios where technology cannot solve moral problems as quickly as social change or cannot solve moral problems at all. Socially driven trajectories seem to have better outcomes for spillover into attitudes towards future farmed animals, wild animals, and artificial sentience because they would set better historical precedent for human morality.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnacmu8z8d4a9\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefacmu8z8d4a9\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;We wrote the bulk of this section in March 2022, and then found the related articles.

Its main point is simply to point out that (broadly speaking) animal advocacy within Effective Altruism is uniform in its welfarist&nbsp;<i>thinking and approach</i>, and that it has&nbsp;<i>assumed with insufficient reason that all abolitionist thinking and approaches are ineffective</i>. This assumption is partly based on (1) poor evidence (2) a narrow conception of what it means to take an abolitionist approach to animal advocacy (3) with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@harrisonnathan/the-actual-number-is-almost-surely-higher-92c908f36517\"><u>one notable exception</u></a>, abolitionists\u2019 poor/absent engagement with animal advocacy&nbsp;<i>on pragmatic terms.</i></p><p>It is important to note I am not claiming that alternative approaches mentioned&nbsp;<i>are&nbsp;</i>(cost-)effective, though I do state reasons this might be true. In logic terms, I am simply saying that currently, the status quo is,</p><ul><li><i>EA Animal Advocacy = Welfarist approaches &amp; not (Abolitionist approaches).</i></li></ul><p>What I am proposing is that it should at least be</p><ul><li><i>EA Animal Advocacy = Welfarist approaches &amp; unknown(Abolitionist approaches).</i></li></ul><p><strong>That is, the community does not have strong enough evidence and arguments to rule out abolitionist thinking and approaches.</strong> This opens up new lines of thinking, new questions for research and new advocacy strategies to test and refine. I also suggest how advocates might measure such strategies\u2019 effectiveness, in ways appropriate to abolitionism (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Gmztp2hWEctnAKg87#Social_Change_Dynamics\"><u>Social Change Dynamics</u></a>).</p><h1>Epistemics</h1><p>I am a pragmatic, abolitionist-leaning animal advocate and vegan and I wrote this series voluntarily, in rare spare time, with help from three other vegans, all of whom have been familiar with EA for a few years. Two of us have a moderate amount of experience (a few years) volunteering with local abolitionist activism of various sorts, and we recognise this could lead to motivated reasoning. Two of us would identify as EAs, and have attended EA conferences. One of us is studying for a PhD in wild animal suffering; I am studying for a PhD in Computer Science. None of us have any formal training or professional experience in EA-related research, or criticism. Most importantly,&nbsp;<strong>this series was written over the course of more than 14 months</strong>; the sheer length of time means research moves on - I\u2019ve done my best to keep up, and have even been scooped on multiple points, but I\u2019ve probably missed things.</p><p>This series is intended to be a big-picture piece, surfacing and investigating common beliefs within EA animal advocacy. It covers a huge amount of ground, more akin to setting a research agenda than answering specific questions: each paragraph could be the subject of an investigation. Necessarily, I deal with generalisations of views, which will not cover all organisations, variations, or advocates. I have made my best efforts to avoid accidentally strawmanning, by, wherever possible, checking my intuition on what the mainstream views are against any available evidence (funding allocations, forum posts, surveys, reports from prominent EA organisations, searches on the EA forum).</p><h1>Summary</h1><ol><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DgS5oRvWqaTJX3EdD\">A Case for Abolition</a><br>I present a short, pragmatic, and EA-targeted case for complete abolition of animal exploitation, and for using abolitionist approaches to achieve this. I show that (1) a longtermist perspective leads one to aim for complete abolition as a goal, and with one key assumption, using abolitionist approaches to get there and (2) contrary to prior work, abolition&nbsp;<i>is helpful to&nbsp;</i>reducing wild animal suffering (and conversely, welfarism could hinder such efforts).</li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/59NyMXxwn5pXFRsdh\">Limitations with Current EA Animal Advocacy</a><br>I argue that the current major strands of EA Animal Advocacy (corporate welfare campaigns, cultured meat and focusing on high-income countries, though I recognise that the last of these is changing, and discuss this too) have the limitations summarised below, and so are jointly insufficient as a means to end farmed animal suffering.<ol><li>Diminishing returns.</li><li>High resource usage.</li><li>Not challenging carnism &amp; speciesism.</li><li>In conflict with helping people in LMICs.</li><li>Biassing towards improving rather than averting lives.</li></ol></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Gmztp2hWEctnAKg87\">Scrutinising Objections to (Traditional) Abolitionist Approaches</a><br>I examine the objections to the following, deemed by EA Animal Advocacy to be ineffective. I think that, in all of these cases, the evidence that these strategies are ineffective is quite weak.&nbsp;<ol><li>Influencing social &amp; political opinion.</li><li>Individual outreach.</li><li>Advocating for elimination (of animal-product consumption) rather than reduction.</li><li>Advocating using an animal-centric message (rather than broad appeal, \u2018safer\u2019 messages like health, environment or taste).</li></ol></li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Z2tFtS3azcxT2yyxf\">Under-explored Abolitionist Approaches</a><br>I discuss promising ideas which are more often found in/associated with abolitionist circles. Intuitively, these ideas do not suffer from the aforementioned limitations and weaknesses, however we don\u2019t prove this, or that they work. &nbsp;I argue that these ideas have either (a) not been considered or (b) been dismissed too quickly: they work and there are cost-effective ways of scaling them.<ol><li>Scaling Animal Agriculture Transitions</li><li>Documentaries (and Other Media)</li><li>Rights-based Legal Actions</li><li>Street Outreach</li><li>Increasing Plant-based Food &amp; Education</li></ol></li></ol><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>In this series of posts, I have suggested many ideas. I suspect some of them are wrong, and many are incomplete, but I do not know which ones, and so I look forward to the discussion that follows. My goals have simply been to:</p><ul><li>point out that there is a whole set of tactics that have not been rigorously considered within EA</li><li>encourage a closer engagement with these tactics from EA organisations and individuals</li><li>encourage more empirical study of the effectiveness of such tactics.</li></ul><p>Even if they turn out to be ineffective upon further study, the process of thinking critically about the implicit assumptions of our activism can only be positive for the community and for the animals we\u2019re trying to help.</p><h1>Acknowledgements</h1><p>A sincere thank you to Peter McLaughlin for reaching out to chat about this, encouraging me to write it up and contributing some paragraphs and suggestions.

Video is tougher to automate than text alone, but I think many of the steps can be automated with roughly existing ML.</p><p>(I still think that ML could be used dangerously, but I also think there are a lot of positive uses in the short-term. I think EAs could actively help develop some uses, and expect to see other groups develop other uses.)<br><br>Some video AI integrations I'd like to see include:</p><ol><li>Every old video should get automatically cleaned up audio.</li><li>Every video and audio file online should get a generated transcript.</li><li>Each transcript should get summarized. Ideally, summarized are individualized or at least customized for viewers.</li><li>Each transcript/summary gets evaluated. We get estimates of how accurate/outdated/relevant/important/neglected/innovative the work is.</li><li>Using something like reinforcement learning, we get better at connecting people with information that is important for them to learn. So, it's not too difficult, inaccessible, or redundant to them.</li><li>If you do want to watch a video, there should be automatic breaks where it interjects it with extra additional context. Like, \"Clarification: This point is now outdated. We recommend skipping ahead 2min.\"</li><li>Videos could also have a lot of extra text annotation. Text on the side that adds extra relevant information about different scenes.</li><li>Instead of watching full 20 minute videos, AI recommends that you only watch minutes 2-5, then 10-15. It summarizes the rest with auto-generated video snippets.</li><li>Stock footage can automatically be replaced by generated footage most preferable to the viewer.</li><li>Eventually, many videos will be completely autogenerated. AI figures out what information is best for you, using what methods, and creates videos on the fly.</li><li>Video is interactive. It's very easy to pause a video and ask it to change topic or answer a specific question.</li><li>Autogenerated and personalized video should be able to feed into user-provided data. So an autogenerated personality could say things like, \u201c<i>So, this concept would have been useful to you 5 days ago, when you had a conversation with Amelia.</i>\u201d</li><li>Once we get used to Virtual Reality, it might make sense to stop emphasizing 2D videos. It\u2019s not clear how to best incorporate 3D videos into metaverse-like settings, but there are different options.</li><li>Once we get brain-computer interfaces, or at least strong video camera driven facial analysis, we could tune video content depending on signals of interest and engagement. If you start getting bored during an educational video, it could jump to a fun example.</li></ol><p>I think video is better than raw text for many people. It's also more work and more information-dense. But much of the pipeline definitely seems automatable to me, mostly with existing technologies.

A significant number of presentations are repeated multiple times to multiple groups of people, in person.</p><p>Sometimes these presentations are recorded and posted online, but they typically are optimized more for in-person audiences, with online audiences as a bit of an afterthought.</p><p>EAs sometimes spend a lot of time on presentations at EAG. These get <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/@EffectiveAltruismVideos/videos\">posted online</a>, but I don't think these videos get much attention. I basically don\u2019t ever remember hearing someone discuss an EAG video they watched in conversation, or referencing it in a blog post.</p><p>If the online audience <i>were</i> the main target, I think presenters could just make videos directly and upload those. That way they'd have much more flexibility (can do multiple takes, add effects, and polish).</p><p>Online webinars are kind of awkward. First, streaming has a lot of disadvantages compared to recorded video. Worse sound quality, more equipment needs, having one single take. Second, these webinars are often barely interactive. If they're not interactive, there's really no first-principles need to have the first 40 minutes made up on the fly and presented at 1x speed, as opposed to being sent to people ahead of time.</p><p>Or take tech presentations. Several companies just did <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sRXVRgMF2lc\">in-person</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DX10XBwpJ6M\">keynote</a> <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6egT6lLRIlI\">addresses</a> at CES. In comparison, Apple has gotten really good at recording (much of) their work ahead of time, and presenting that in <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ux6zXguiqxM\">highly polished videos</a>[1]. Maybe it\u2019s a flex to present your work in real-time in one take and not mess up, or to physically be in the audience when that one take happens.</p><p>There seems to be some dramatic pull that gets people to converge on presenting and watching things live, especially when they are in person. It's hard to explain this pull with any simple cost-benefit analysis.<br><br>Some quick hypotheses (in part, from comments):</p><ol><li>&nbsp;The EA Funders and leaders don't seem to watch videos much, so it wouldn't help many orgs.&nbsp;</li><li>It's a lot of work to do this well. The setup cost is significant.</li><li>The standard for \"well-made Youtube videos\" is absurdly high, and people are worried that content not at that level will look bad.</li><li>Video is associated with stupider people (in the eyes of many)</li><li>The required skills are pretty different than writing. Lots of strong EA researchers are not great presenters.</li><li>A lot of people in our community don't like watching video or listening to audio. They often really prefer text.</li><li>It's assumed that if you make video, it's not for EAs, but for \"the generic Youtube audience\".</li></ol><p>(Of course, this parallels the question of why <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flipped_classroom\">flipped classrooms</a> haven't done incredibly well. Having teachers give long monologues on repeat seems stupid prima facie, but it still seems to work.)</p><p>[1] I remember their segments during Covid mostly seemed prerecorded. Even the current ones seem highly prerecorded to me, but I\u2019m not very sure where the boundaries are.

Various factors, primarily uncertainty about the degree of harmful effects from arsenic, may reduce the overall cost-effectiveness, but arsenic interventions nonetheless have the potential to be promising, although at current margins they are likely less effective than Givewell top charities.</p><h2>Introduction and Scope of the Problem</h2><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human exposure to arsenic primarily results from groundwater contamination. Inorganic arsenic contamination in groundwater can lead to human exposure in three main ways: drinking contaminated water, using contaminated water for cooking, and using contaminated water to irrigate crops. The primary negative health effects of arsenic are increased risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease (including heart attacks), but other adverse effects include a higher risk of skin lesions, diabetes, pulmonary disease, stroke, cognitive deficits (in the case of prenatal and early childhood exposure), and (in some circumstances) Blackfoot disease.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreff88ied0q2lh\"><sup><a href=\"#fnf88ied0q2lh\">[4]</a></sup></span><sup>&nbsp;</sup><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref70lcp5a2ylq\"><sup><a href=\"#fn70lcp5a2ylq\">[5]</a></sup></span><sup>&nbsp;</sup><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9cyzdvln4hr\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9cyzdvln4hr\">[6]</a></sup></span><sup>&nbsp;</sup><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefw2j24k7u5k\"><sup><a href=\"#fnw2j24k7u5k\">[7]</a></sup></span><sup>&nbsp;</sup><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmiptgbqlyl8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmiptgbqlyl8\">[8]</a></sup></span></p><p>As of 2021, an estimated 300 million people worldwide live in areas with groundwater contaminated by arsenic (more than 10 \u03bcg/L), with approximately 100 million of those people living in areas with groundwater arsenic levels of more than 50 \u03bcg/L, which has been linked to an especially high likelihood of severe health consequences.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefc99gmd5d476\"><sup><a href=\"#fnc99gmd5d476\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;According to the World Health Organization, several countries have been found to have a high level of arsenic in groundwater, including Argentina, Bangladesh, Cambodia, Chile, China, India, Mexico, Pakistan, the United States of America, and Vietnam.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefb8e11vvvc04\"><sup><a href=\"#fnb8e11vvvc04\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Arsenic exposure is particularly common in Bangladesh, where the number of people exposed to arsenic in groundwater has been estimated at 35 million - 77 million.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefahmgg4bz5de\"><sup><a href=\"#fnahmgg4bz5de\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;More recent estimates from 2012 indicate that remediation efforts have reduced this number to 19 million people exposed to arsenic levels greater than 50 \u03bcg/L,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefs3nwj2xjmpn\"><sup><a href=\"#fns3nwj2xjmpn\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and it is likely that this number has continued to decline since 2012.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673319293/mirroredImages/3b3hhDnxxTbDKqcEq/mk8an9jjly6baq0tk7jh.jpg\" alt=\"\"></p><p><i>Arsenic contamination around the world.</i><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefc8y446nqr3g\"><sup><a href=\"#fnc8y446nqr3g\">[13]</a></sup></span></p><p>Various studies have attempted to determine the effects of arsenic exposure on overall mortality. A ten-year cohort study in Bangladesh<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref711neroafco\"><sup><a href=\"#fn711neroafco\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;found that compared to people exposed to 0.1 - 10.0 \u03bcg/L of arsenic in well water, people exposed to 10.1\u201350.0 \u03bcg/L of arsenic in well water had an all-cause mortality rate 1.34 times higher (95% CI 0.99\u20131.82), people exposed to 50.1 - 150.0 \u03bcg/L of arsenic in well water had an all-cause mortality rate 1.09 times higher (95% CI 0.81\u20131.47), and people exposed to more than 150.0 \u03bcg/L (up to a maximum of 864.0 \u03bcg/L) had an all-cause mortality rate 1.68 times higher (95% CI 1.26\u20132.23). Although there is significant uncertainty in these numbers (in particular, several of the confidence intervals allow for the possibility that the mortality rate was the same or lower), the study estimated that in the cohort studied, <strong>21.4% of all deaths in the population of people exposed to arsenic levels above 10 \u03bcg/L resulted from arsenic exposure</strong>. However, this study has been criticized for failing to account for differences in socioeconomic status by region, and may provide an overestimate of the true mortality difference. A 2004 study that considered only specific diseases that arsenic had previously been found to have a strong causal link with estimated that arsenic was responsible for a much smaller number of deaths -- 9,136 deaths and 174,174 DALYs per year, roughly 0.3% of the total disease burden in Bangladesh.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmol3zeo3e4a\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmol3zeo3e4a\">[15]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Another observational study, analyzing total mortality rates and mortality rates for a variety of diseases, found that the mortality rate for people who were exposed to high levels of arsenic was 1.32 times higher than the mortality rate for those who were not (95% confidence interval: 1.25 - 1.39).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefg5bewk986b\"><sup><a href=\"#fng5bewk986b\">[16]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, this study focused on areas with extremely high rates of exposure, vastly exceeding even the 50 \u03bcg/L standard.</p><p>A 2011 review in Bangladesh estimated that in Bangladesh alone, arsenic exposure was responsible for 250,000 infant deaths per year and 200,000 - 300,000 cancer cases per \"generation\".<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2f4qij4ytwx\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2f4qij4ytwx\">[17]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Although the number of infant deaths has likely decreased since then due to attempts at remediation, this serves to illustrate the approximate scope of the problem, particularly in areas that have not benefited from such remediation efforts. The same study referenced a rough order-of-magnitude estimate suggesting that exposure to 50 \u03bcg/L of arsenic increases cancer risk by 1 percentage point.</p><p>The number of contradictory findings makes it difficult to estimate the exact mortality burden of arsenic. The fact that arsenic primarily increases the risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease, which can take years to occur, also makes distinguishing between these possibilities more difficult. However, we can reasonably take arsenic being responsible for 0.3% of all deaths among those who were exposed to high levels of arsenic as a lower bound, and arsenic being responsible for 21.4% of deaths among those exposed as an upper bound.&nbsp;As these estimates are wildly divergent, they may result in significantly different cost-effectiveness numbers. (To be clear, both estimates have flaws making it unlikely that they are the \u201ctrue value\u201d -- but by taking them as a lower and upper bound, it is possible to get a sense of the cost-effectiveness of arsenic interventions under different assumptions.)</p><p>Arsenic has also been implicated as a likely cause of cognitive impairment<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2zwd0f4ijqk\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2zwd0f4ijqk\">[18]</a></sup></span>, and reducing arsenic exposure levels could increase male incomes by up to 9% (although this is a maximum estimate, and therefore it likely overestimates the true value).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefa82vw5nddv\"><sup><a href=\"#fna82vw5nddv\">[19]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The typical proposed mechanism for the income effect is that arsenic leads to cognitive impairment and reduces the total amount of school completed, both of which reduce lifetime incomes.</p><p>Specifically with regards to arsenic in food, the mortality burden of arsenic in food has been estimated at 1.4 million DALYs/year from increased cancer risk and 49 DALYs/year from increased risk of coronary heart disease.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhmoydhik0u7\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhmoydhik0u7\">[20]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Arsenic contamination in food can result either from arsenic in water used to irrigate crops, or from arsenic in the soil used by crops itself. Unfortunately, many common methods of arsenic treatment will not affect this source of arsenic, but I have attempted to note exceptions.</p><h2>Neglectedness</h2><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Various organizations and governments have attempted to remediate the negative effects of arsenic; an incomplete list can be found here.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbi43eegnc2i\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbi43eegnc2i\">[21]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, so far, these interventions have mainly been focused on Bangladesh, due to the particularly high rates of arsenic poisoning in Bangladesh.<strong>&nbsp;Arsenic interventions outside of Bangladesh are comparably neglected, even in countries with significant levels of arsenic contamination, and could be high-impact.</strong></p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, interventions have been largely focused on digging deep tubewells.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1ecntvckrm6\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1ecntvckrm6\">[22]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This could be problematic both because of increases in deaths from pathogens and because of the mixed effectiveness of digging deeper wells.</p><h2>Possible interventions and theory of change</h2><p>Several possible interventions and the theory of change for each of them are listed below.

One important factor to keep in mind is that many of these interventions are easiest to target in wells, and may not be nearly as effective at reducing arsenic contamination from crops.</p><p>Other ideas that I considered but did not write a detailed theory of change for: paying people to move to areas without arsenic-contaminated water (high likelihood of negative second order effects and low feasibility due to disruptiveness of moving), cementation to remove arsenic from water (pilot studies have suggested that cementation only reduces arsenic levels in water to 2 mg/kg), distributing arsenic testing kits to individuals (even if you know your water is arsenic contaminated, this does not mean you can do anything about it, and it is likely more efficient to test water on a water-source basis since multiple families may get water from the same source), and various forms of incentivising industrial actors not to contaminate groundwater (although this can sometimes be a source of arsenic, preliminary investigations pointed to naturally occurring inorganic arsenic as a much larger factor).</p><p>I did some preliminary research into various interventions relating to the provision of new water sources that are not contaminated by arsenic; however, recent research has found that in cases where changing to a different water source requires more than 300 meters of additional travel, increased mortality as a result of diarrhea substantially outweighs any mortality benefits of avoiding arsenic contamination.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref74rwm9xoyd\"><sup><a href=\"#fn74rwm9xoyd\">[23]</a></sup></span></p><h2>Interventions in more detail</h2><p><u>Adsorption</u></p><p>Adsorption refers to a process in which a chemical accumulates as a film on top of a liquid (or solid).

The laterite itself was found to have a negligible cost, but transportation costs were estimated at $43 per year in 2003 dollars for a household using 40 L/day, which using our (higher) estimates of per capita water use for consistency with other estimates is equivalent to a cost of $108.77 per person per year, and would potentially be even higher outside of Argentina (the location of the Misiones). A field study of a laterite-based adsorption filter found that regardless of the initial concentration of arsenic in the groundwater, the filter could reliably reduce arsenic concentrations to below 10 \u03bcg/L.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcbuar4vzlje\"><sup><a href=\"#fncbuar4vzlje\">[34]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The same study estimated the cost as between $0.20 USD and $0.30 USD/m<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;(in 2017 dollars), including transportation and labor costs associated with distribution.

Taking this estimate at face value and applying the same heuristic for distribution costs that I used previously, I estimate the total costs of this method to be approximately $7.42/person/year. One important note about this method is that it does require electricity access.</p><p><u>New Tubewells</u></p><p>Digging deeper tubewells that would be less contaminated by arsenic is a commonly used strategy for reducing the levels of arsenic in drinking water.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbhzbcq731or\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbhzbcq731or\">[46]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, it is unclear how effective this strategy is; one study found that the average arsenic levels in a sample of deep tubewells in Narail Sadar, Bangladesh, was still 42.59 \u03bcg&nbsp;(much lower than the average level in shallow tubewells of 91.33 \u03bcg, but still roughly four times the WHO limit).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbf1y1kx6n8t\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbf1y1kx6n8t\">[47]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Another study in Bangladesh, which measured arsenic levels in about 6,000 wells, found that deep tubewells were much less likely to have arsenic levels greater than 50 \u03bcg/liter (8% vs. 25-75%).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzwi8w6bu61\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzwi8w6bu61\">[48]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, although the researchers did not provide exact information, it appears from looking at the provided graphs that many deep tubewells still had arsenic levels of more than 10 \u03bcg/L.</p><p>Another major drawback of this plan is the possibility of increasing mortality due to increasing the distance to safe water, which can in some cases significantly outweigh the beneficial effects of arsenic reduction.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9eyy5zhxyze\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9eyy5zhxyze\">[49]</a></sup></span><sup>&nbsp;</sup><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefs3w40qe4hu\"><sup><a href=\"#fns3w40qe4hu\">[50]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, this could be mitigated by ensuring that new wells are dug in locations that enable all families to have a deep tubewell within 300 meters of their house, although such measures would increase the cost due to the higher number of wells that must be dug.</p><p>The total cost of installing these wells is roughly $1000 - $2000/well (including distributional costs).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefl6qlj61hxta\"><sup><a href=\"#fnl6qlj61hxta\">[51]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The number of people who use each well varies substantially, although in order for these wells to not increase deaths from pathogens the number would likely need to be relatively small. Using a rough estimate of 10 people per drinking well, with tubewells typically lasting 10-40 years,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1xjdio3yj4k\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1xjdio3yj4k\">[52]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;we find a cost per person-year of clean water of between $2.50 - $20.</p><p><u>Data Collection</u></p><p>One possible meta-intervention is to collect more data on the levels of arsenic in wells and other water sources outside of Bangladesh. Although there is substantial data on arsenic levels in wells in Bangladesh, there is not as much information on arsenic levels in individual wells outside of Bangladesh. This information could be used to better target arsenic-related interventions.</p><p>The cost of individual kits for testing wells has been estimated as being between $0.17 and $6.60 (2012 dollars), not including distribution costs.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjp08zrqmqu\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjp08zrqmqu\">[53]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This is equivalent to roughly $0.22 to $8.67 in current dollars. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of field testing kits has been called into question.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefutaay21d78h\"><sup><a href=\"#fnutaay21d78h\">[54]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;More recent analysis has found that the effectiveness of testing kits varies by the type of kit, but that two types of tests (Lamotte and Quick II) are both accurate and precise.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrclbiu0bwj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrclbiu0bwj\">[55]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;These tests cost $4.16/test and $4.62/test respectively (2020 dollars), which is equivalent to roughly $4.79 and $5.32 in 2022 dollars (not including distribution costs).</p><p><u>Membrane filters and other non-adsorption-based filters</u></p><p>This method of arsenic treatment includes a variety of different methods of filtering arsenic through some sort of filter designed to prevent arsenic from passing through. Filter effectiveness varies widely by the type of filter used. A review of the cost-effectiveness of different arsenic removal methods found that many types of filters (including ceramic filters, which have commonly been used in Bangladesh) did not actually filter out arsenic well enough to meet WHO standards, were extremely expensive, or both.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref95qb9tel75a\"><sup><a href=\"#fn95qb9tel75a\">[24]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, this does not rule out the possibility of other types of filters, which were not studied, being cost-effective.</p><p>TFC (thin film composite) membranes, a common type of membrane, appear to reduce arsenic concentrations to below 10&nbsp;\u03bcg/L, with exact reduction varying by pressure, but roughly 96% reduction at 1 bar of pressure.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4svkk9prxua\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4svkk9prxua\">[25]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;The same study found that they were more effective than UF membranes, another common membrane type. However, this was tested solely in a lab and may not properly generalize to real-world interventions. Another study measuring the effectiveness of several different types of membranes found that TFC membranes could be up to 99.8% effective.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref73wpbypbg1e\"><sup><a href=\"#fn73wpbypbg1e\">[26]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Although it did not provide detailed cost information for individual membranes, this study also found that membrane filters cost between $1.41 and $3.72 per m<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;of water in 2021 dollars (with exact prices depending on whether the membrane was a reverse osmosis membrane or nanofiltration membrane). This suggests the total cost of providing one person with clean water for a year could be up to $204.50 in today\u2019s dollars.</p><p>Other types of nanofiltration membranes have been suggested as a promising intervention but do not seem to be sufficiently effective, as confirmed by a systematic review of different nanofiltration membranes.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2ojtj7k5jod\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2ojtj7k5jod\">[27]</a></sup></span></p><p>Some evidence also suggests that even when people are provided with filters, they do not actually use them.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefq6jxh8sm78\"><sup><a href=\"#fnq6jxh8sm78\">[28]</a></sup></span></p><p><u>Precipitation</u></p><p>This technique refers to combining arsenic-contaminated water with other chemicals to transmute the arsenic into a solid compound, which can more easily be removed. The effectiveness varies depending on several factors, but in the best case scenario it can reduce arsenic levels to \u201cbelow the level of detection,\u201d<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefn9vjyhczf2l\"><sup><a href=\"#fnn9vjyhczf2l\">[29]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;although this result is somewhat confusing since the data provided indicate that even in the best case scenario precipitation seems to only reduce arsenic levels to about 25 \u03bcg/L. However, this study has various issues making it more difficult to generalize, such as only examining much higher starting concentrations.</p><p>More recent studies have found that depending on the chemicals used to precipitate the arsenic, it is possible to reduce arsenic levels to below 10 \u03bcg/L.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjsdt85cgdi\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjsdt85cgdi\">[30]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, these studies are somewhat limited in generalizability, as they find that effectiveness depends on the level of aluminum contaminants, which cause the effectiveness and necessary time to vary.</p><p>I was not able to find information on the typical costs for arsenic precipitation. Due to this fact, the relatively limited effectiveness of precipitation, and other information I found about drawbacks of this method, I think precipitation is likely to be less cost-effective and reliable than other methods.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><u>Treating Soil with Lime</u></p><p>Treating arsenic-heavy soils with lime appears to substantially reduce the arsenic concentration in the soil, potentially as low as 1.4 mg/kg.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref8bdqmlnqfsh\"><sup><a href=\"#fn8bdqmlnqfsh\">[42]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, it is unclear what the effect of this on drinking water arsenic concentration is, as this amount is significantly more than&nbsp;the recommended value for water (although not all of it would actually get into the water). This method is notable because it could potentially significantly reduce the levels of arsenic in crops grown in this soil, but I was unable to find further details on the level of this effect.. I was unable to find estimates of the cost of this treatment method.</p><p><u>Treating Drinking Water with Citrus</u></p><p>Lime was discussed frequently in sources I reviewed, but it does not appear to have a very substantial effect size -- in an observational study of a water treatment plant, it was found to reduce arsenic levels from 36 \u03bcg/liter to 16 \u03bcg/liter,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefir82pxt08l\"><sup><a href=\"#fnir82pxt08l\">[43]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;which is still above the recommended safe amount. Similarly, an attempt to use lime as part of a SORAS process to remove arsenic in a laboratory from actual groundwater found that it was only about 63 - 70.2% effective at removing arsenic, with final concentrations between 50 and 120 \u03bcg/L.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjanbmo9egw8\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjanbmo9egw8\">[44]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Although these studies may have generated worse results due to relying on actual arsenic-contaminated groundwater rather than being conducted purely in laboratory conditions, this nonetheless suggests that lime treatment of drinking water is not very effective. A 2019 review that included this study estimated based on given prices and inflation rates that the total cost of treating 1m<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;of water with lime was roughly $0.49 in 2019 USD, although this does not include distributional costs.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefz5cqlfupvt\"><sup><a href=\"#fnz5cqlfupvt\">[45]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;A very rough estimate for the cost of treating one person\u2019s water for a year is therefore $28.56. Tomato juice, which was analyzed in the same study, was moderately more effective, achieving 90.2-97% removal rates, but it still resulted in arsenic levels of between 10 and 30&nbsp;\u03bcg. The cost of treating 1 m<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;of water with tomato juice was estimated at $0.65 in 2019 USD (again, not accounting for distributional costs), meaning that a very rough estimate of the cost of treating water with tomato for a year is therefore $37.88.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Notes on Cost-Effectiveness Estimates</h2><p><u>General notes on cost-effectiveness</u></p><p>Many of the interventions described above &nbsp;rely on assumptions about the amount of water people use each year. A survey from 2006 found that on average, people in Bangladesh use 3.53 liters of water per day for drinking and 6.71 liters per day for cooking (with a 95% confidence interval of 3.45\u20133.61 L and 6.52\u20136.89 L respectively), or approximately 10.24 L in total.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0ltubwpz5q1n\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0ltubwpz5q1n\">[56]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This means that treating 1 m<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;of water is equivalent to providing roughly 97 days of drinking and cooking water for a single person. For water treatment solutions that are implemented at the well, the actual number of days of safe water provided by treating 1 m<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;of water could be up to about six times lower, as water is also used for other non-consumption purposes, which is often obtained from the same wells that water for drinking and cooking is obtained from. For the purpose of the cost-effectiveness analysis in this section I will conservatively assume that treating 1 m<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;of water is equivalent to providing 15 days of clean water for a single person, and that treating 25 m<sup>3</sup>&nbsp;of water is therefore sufficient to provide clean water to a single person for one year.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefth91ogpy9ga\"><sup><a href=\"#fnth91ogpy9ga\">[57]</a></sup></span></p><p>For the purpose of these calculations, the cost of each intervention was doubled in situations where more accurate distributional costs were not available to account for distributional costs. However, this heuristic likely underestimates the distributional costs of otherwise-cheap interventions and overestimates the distributional costs of expensive interventions.</p><p>To account for inflation, an inflation calculator<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxsli5x16jph\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxsli5x16jph\">[58]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;was used to convert prices to 2022 dollars.

In some cases (such as the lime and tomato treatments) these interventions were also relatively expensive, which combined with their low efficacy meant they were very unlikely to be cost effective.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <s>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In creating these estimates, I largely discounted the income effect of arsenic treatment. I do think that this effect could be significant, and should be considered in further research, but the evidence for the effect is weaker. (I am less confident in this, but I also suspect that if the health effects of arsenic are on the lower end of the plausible range, that this suggests that there was significant income confounding, which has been suggested as a likely mechanism for overestimates of the health effects. I would expect this to indicate that the income effects are also less significant/subject to the same confounders.)</s></p><p><strong>Edit 1/14/2022:</strong> With the mortality effects (but not the income effects) being off by a factor of ten, the income effects of arsenic are relatively more important. Unfortunately, they are also much more uncertain, but I have attempted below to create a model that incorporates their effects.</p><p>Overall cost-effectiveness varied substantially depending on the assumptions made about the effect of arsenic on mortality. Under the most generous assumptions about arsenic impacts on mortality, arsenic exposure prevention was moderately less effective than GiveWell top charities. The lower bound for cost-per-death-averted was $6304; limiting only to interventions that are backed by field studies, the lower bound for cost-per-death-averted was $7749. (The true cost-effectiveness is likely somewhat lower due to imperfect targeting).&nbsp;However, making narrower assumptions about the impact of arsenic on mortality rate, the interventions became much less cost-effective (at minimum roughly $449,696/death averted).</p><p><strong>Edit 1/14/2022:</strong> I also created a secondary model designed to account for income effects. This is obviously heavily dependent on assumptions about the relative moral weight of income increases vs. averting deaths. <strong>For the purpose of this model, I made the following assumptions:</strong></p><ul><li>Increasing 200 people's income by 1% for one year is approximately as valuable as averting 1 DALY. (This is based on OpenPhilanthropy's model.)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxoqqp2ezkqo\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxoqqp2ezkqo\">[59]</a></sup></span></li><li>Averting a death from arsenic is roughly equivalent to averting 30 DALYs. (This may be somewhat incorrect in either direction: many causes of arsenic-based mortality primarily affect older adults, but these include various conditions that can significantly impact quality of life prior to death).</li><li>As a simplifying assumption, increasing one person's income by 9% as roughly 9x as valuable as increasing it by 1%. This is arguably slightly inaccurate due to the diminishing marginal utility of money.</li><li>Gaining the full benefit of the income effect requires treating arsenic continuously over someone's life -- it is possible that the main cognitive and income-based harms occur in childhood, but targeting arsenic interventions towards exclusively children would be difficult to impossible. I approximate average lifespan at 73 years (the life expectancy at birth in Bangladesh in 2019)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefb330cdzdmap\"><sup><a href=\"#fnb330cdzdmap\">[60]</a></sup></span>, although the true value may vary by country. I approximate income effects as affecting someone for roughly 50 years.</li><li>As the income effect has only been studied at all in men, I do not incorporate potential benefits to women's income in my cost effectiveness analysis (which therefore means I may underestimate the income benefits).</li></ul><p>I modelled three scenarios: one without any income benefits, one where arsenic remediation increases income by half of the measured effect (4.5%), and one where it increases income by the full measured effect (9%), though the last scenario is very optimistic. All these models can be found in the<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kxkCSOBq9RghQjzUDZh8xG7_jFxHpFGfIj44Ywiswsk/edit#gid=0\"> cost-effectiveness spreadsheet</a>. In the 4.5% scenario, I estimate arsenic remediation as costing roughly $5,174.88 - $6360.50 per life-equivalent saved. In the 9% scenario, I estimate arsenic remediation as costing roughly $4,388.72 - $5394.22 per life-equivalent saved.</p><h2>Next Questions/Further Steps</h2><p>Some further questions that I expect to be particularly relevant to this research include:</p><ul><li>Can we narrow down the range of mortality-resulting-from-arsenic? Right now, the level of uncertainty is a major barrier in cost-effectiveness estimates.</li><li>How significant are the practical barriers to using adsorption as a method of removing arsenic, beyond those outlined in this report? Are any of them serious enough to make it difficult or impossible to scale outside of small-scale trials?</li><li>How difficult would it be to redirect resources from one arsenic intervention to another? (For example, could work that is currently being directed towards digging replacement shallow wells be used instead for other interventions?)</li><li>How does the significant lag time on the effects of arsenic interventions affect the effectiveness of arsenic-related interventions?</li><li>How robust is the evidence for arsenic-contamination-related income effects? How does this affect the cost-effectiveness of arsenic interventions?</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Overall, the most promising intervention appears to be adsorption (with any of several chemicals as promising options -- most notably laterite and NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, KMnO<sub>4</sub>, and FeCl<sub>3</sub>, which stand out due to being supported by field studies). Ion-exchange systems stand out as a more speculative option that could be more cost effective but will likely face implementation challenges when applied outside of the laboratory. Membrane filters, precipitation, and treatment with lime and other citruses appear to be either ineffective or not cost effective, even under very generous assumptions. Digging deep tubewells is a common option that is likely actively harmful as implemented, although the implementation problems are&nbsp;not insurmountable.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I identified a lower bound for cost-per-death-averted of $6304, or $7749 when limiting only to interventions backed by field studies. After incorporating income effects, this could be up to $4,388.72 - $5394.22, but this requires very optimistic assumptions. On the current margins, this is slightly less effective than Givewell top charities. I believe it has the potential to be a promising intervention in the future (as current interventions hit diminishing margining returns or are otherwise obviated), but at current margins it would likely be better to direct resources elsewhere.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Acknowledgements</h2><p>&nbsp;Akhil provided guidance and mentorship, as well as feedback on my first draft.

The result of this is that by the time that (ops) person is hired, it is expected that one person solves all operational issues for the project.</li><li>Often by the time projects receive funding they don\u2019t know \u201cwhat to do with the money\u201d and start looking fast into fiscal sponsors or other ways to receive the funds.</li></ul><h3>Some things I suggest (or even suggested during my 1-on-1s)</h3><ul><li>For community builders to talk with their community members more about how they are comparing different career options.

There is a tradition in Poland to buy live Carp and slaughter them on Christmas Eve. After several major retailers withdrew from selling live fish as a result of animal advocacy groups\u2019 efforts, they noticed a trend of consumers moving from Carp to higher status fish like Salmon. These are carnivorous and require fish feed, resulting in possible net negative effects on animal suffering.&nbsp;</p><p>They ran a survey to assess the population\u2019s likely substitute buying behaviors if live Carp were not available, and found ~24% would switch to Salmon. They then ran a rough model which concluded the campaign had a negative expected value, and so suspended it.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vwK3v3Mekf6Jjpeep/let-s-think-about-slowing-down-ai-1\"><u>Let\u2019s think about slowing down AI</u></a></p><p><i>by Katja_Grace</i></p><p>The author feels slowing down AI progress has been dismissed as an intervention historically (though \u2018don\u2019t speed it up\u2019 is popular), and suggest more thinking should happen on it.</p><p>Common arguments against are that it requires coordination and coordination is difficult, there are race mechanics involved, slowing can put us at odds with AI capabilities folk, lose us benefits of progress (eg. relevant learnings and reducing other existential risks), pattern matches onto luddism, and only delays the problem anyway.</p><p>They counter with:</p><ul><li>It\u2019s tractable - other valuable technologies (eg. medical research) has been drastically slowed due to safety and ethics concerns. The median surveyed ML researcher also gives a ~5-10% chance AI destroys humanity, showing it\u2019s possible to convince others.</li><li>Partial solutions are valuable - even if a global agreement isn\u2019t on the table, convincing certain manufacturers / researchers / funders, increasing public buy-in and creating a norm against doing dangerous things in AI, or moving some resources to less dangerous AI research might be (more examples in post).</li><li>Winning an arms race to be the first to build advanced AI is futile if you don\u2019t have a way to implement enough safety to not die from it. It\u2019s therefore not clear a race will happen.</li><li>\u2018We\u2019 are not the AI safety community, or the US. If we don\u2019t want the US to slow down and China to win the race, why not work on having China slow down? If we don\u2019t want the AI safety community to break relationships with AI capabilities, why not have someone outside that community do the slowing work instead?</li><li>Buying time is worthwhile - it gives space to buy yet more time, advance safety research, or for geopolitics to change favorably (making other interventions possible).&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/5XKAsEBMuxiycTHL7/working-with-the-beef-industry-for-chicken-welfare\"><u>Working with the Beef Industry for Chicken Welfare</u></a></p><p><i>by RobertY</i></p><p>Historically, the US farmed animal welfare movement has seen itself as working in opposition to the entire animal agriculture industry. However, the vast majority of animal agriculture suffering is from small animals (eg. chicken, fish, invertebrates). This makes the US beef industry a potential ally, as they have incentives to reduce consumption of those animals in favor of beef (eg. via getting chicken welfare protections in line with the higher requirements for cows).</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Community &amp; Media</h2><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/oGdCtvuQv4BTuNFoC/good-things-that-happened-in-ea-this-year\"><u>Good things that happened in EA this year</u></a></p><p><i>by Shakeel Hashim</i></p><p>A selection of 21 good things that happened in EA this year.

This feels nicer to be in, and has significant efficiency benefits. Recent posts have argued for a low-trust regime ie. more transparency so actions can be scrutinized, and more elaborate governance. The author argues this is currently unnecessary and costly, and suggests EA remain high-trust with occasional verification that people have behaved trustworthily.&nbsp;<br><br>A main argument they give is that people in EA organisations seem trustworthy, because we\u2019ve spent time recently looking for bad behavior and all the examples put forward seem either factually wrong or fall under cases of bad decisions for good reasons, lapses in personal judgment, or genuine disagreements on the best actions to do - which low-trust won\u2019t help with.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rvEMFn2tJZChakHf8/may-the-factory-farms-burn\"><u>May The Factory Farms Burn</u></a></p><p><i>by Omnizoid</i></p><p>Cross-post of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://benthams.substack.com/p/factory-farming-delenda-est\"><u>this post</u></a> by&nbsp;<i>Bentham\u2019s bulldog</i>.

They quote various sources to lay out the horrors of factory farming, and note that while there are many tough philosophical questions, whether to continue our current consumption of meat is \u201cas close to a no-brainer as you get in normative ethics\u201d. Even valuing animals at 1/1000 of humans, our treatment of them is \u201cmorally equivalent to brutally torturing and killing ~80 million people every year\u201d. Individual consumption decisions can make a difference, with reductions of weeks of tortured suffering by not eating a chicken sandwich.

However, even if you haven\u2019t been trained, you should push back against the bystander effect and act when in a situation requiring it. They\u2019re fairly intuitive, and without help someone with blocked oxygen will rapidly die.

Certainly, real interest rates are not frequently featured in newspaper headlines \u2013 if any interest rates are quoted, it is typically&nbsp;<i>nominal</i> interest rates \u2013 and stock prices receive by far the most popular attention.</p><p><strong>The importance of real rates.</strong> However, even if real interest rates are not often discussed, real interest rates affect&nbsp;<i>every&nbsp;</i>asset price. This is because asset prices always reflect some&nbsp;<i>discounted</i> value of future cash flows: for example, the price of Alphabet stock reflects the present&nbsp;<i>discounted</i> value of future Alphabet dividend payments. These future dividend payments are discounted using a discount rate&nbsp;<i>which is determined by the prevailing real interest rate</i>. Thus the claim that real interest rates affect every asset price.&nbsp;</p><p>As a result, if real interest rates are \u2018wrong\u2019,&nbsp;<i>every</i> asset price is wrong. If real interest rates are wrong,&nbsp;<i>a lot</i> of money is on the table.</p><p><strong>Stocks are hard to interpret.&nbsp;</strong>It may nonetheless be tempting to look at&nbsp;<i>stock</i> prices to attempt to interpret how the market is thinking about AI timelines (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.airr.io/quote/636d77b9249836a41ad9e0e1\"><u>Ajeya Cotra</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/MatthewJBar/status/1599394102881456130\"><u>Matthew Barnett</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/v7omil/if_we_think_agi_is_imminent_in_which_companies/\"><u>/r/ssc</u></a>).

For instance, OpenAI has committed to a capped profit model, and others&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/4061/will-any-major-ai-company-commit-to-an-ai-windfall-clause-by-2025/\"><u>may</u></a> sign on to a similar \u2018<a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/windfallclause/\"><u>Windfall Clause</u></a>\u2019. Beyond corporate altruism, it seems extremely plausible that if a private company develops truly transformative AI technology then the state will (attempt to) nationalize and expropriate it to distribute the benefits more broadly, preventing profits.&nbsp;</li><li>Third, stock valuations are extremely idiosyncratic: which stock should we be looking at? And critically, even if we take a basket of tech companies and average over them, then this only includes&nbsp;<i>public</i> companies. If the market expects transformative AI in 12 months, but only because it will be developed by OpenAI \u2013 a company which is not traded publicly \u2013 then this will not show up in any equity index.</li><li>Fourth, and quite importantly,&nbsp;<i>it is not obvious whether expectations of transformative AI would raise or lower stock prices</i>. This is because, as described in the previous subsection, stock prices reflect the present-discounted value of future profits; and advanced AI may raise those future profits, but \u2013 as the central thesis of this piece argues \u2013 advanced AI would&nbsp;<i>also</i> raise the interest rate used to discount those profits. The net effect on stock prices is not immediately obvious.&nbsp;<ol><li>(In math, briefly: if the price&nbsp;P is the value of future profits&nbsp;D discounted at rate&nbsp;r, i.e.&nbsp;P=D/r, then transformative AI may raise future profits&nbsp;D but it could raise the discount rate&nbsp;r by even more.)</li><li>(Higher growth causes lower average stock prices if the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://eml.berkeley.edu/~enakamura/teaching/EstimatingIES.pdf\"><u>intertemporal elasticity of substitution</u></a> is greater than one, rather than less than one.

However,&nbsp;<u>30- to 50-year real interest rates are low</u>. We argue that this suggests one of two possibilities:</p><ol><li><strong>Long(er) timelines.</strong>&nbsp;Financial markets are often highly effective information aggregators (the \u201cefficient market hypothesis\u201d), and therefore real interest rates accurately reflect that transformative AI is unlikely to be developed in the next 30-50 years.</li><li><strong>Market inefficiency.</strong>&nbsp;Markets are radically underestimating how soon advanced AI technology will be developed, and real interest rates are therefore too low. There is thus an opportunity for philanthropists to borrow while real rates are low to cheaply do good today; and/or an opportunity for anyone to earn excess returns by betting that real rates will rise.</li></ol><p>In the rest of this post we flesh out this argument.</p><ol><li>Both intuitively and under every mainstream economic model, the \u201c<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/could-advanced-ai-drive-explosive-economic-growth/\"><u>explosive growth</u></a>\u201d caused by&nbsp;<i>aligned</i> AI would cause high real interest rates.</li><li>Both intuitively and under every mainstream economic model, the existential risk caused by&nbsp;<i>unaligned</i> AI would cause high real interest rates.</li><li>We show that in the historical data, indeed, real interest rates have been correlated with future growth.</li><li>Plugging the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AfH2oPHCApdKicM4m/two-year-update-on-my-personal-ai-timelines\"><u>Cotra probabilities</u></a> for AI timelines into the baseline workhorse model of economic growth implies substantially higher real interest rates today.</li><li>In particular, we argue that markets are decisively rejecting the shortest possible timelines of 0-10 years.</li><li>We argue that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1455949250320240641\"><u>the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) is a reasonable prior</u></a>, and therefore one reasonable interpretation of low real rates is that since markets are simply&nbsp;<i>not</i> forecasting short timelines, neither should we be forecasting short timelines.</li><li>Alternatively, if you believe that financial markets are wrong, then you have the opportunity to (1) borrow cheaply today and use that money to e.g. fund AI safety work; and/or (2) earn alpha by betting that real rates will rise.</li></ol><p>An order-of-magnitude estimate is that,&nbsp;<u>if markets are getting this wrong, then there is easily $1 trillion lying on the table in the US treasury bond market alone</u> \u2013 setting aside the enormous implications for every other asset class.</p><p><strong>Interpretation.</strong> We view our argument as the best existing&nbsp;<i>outside view</i> evidence on AI timelines \u2013 but also as only&nbsp;<i>one</i> model among a mixture of models that you should consider when thinking about AI timelines. The logic here is a simple implication of a few basic concepts in orthodox economic theory and some supporting empirical evidence, which is important because the unprecedented nature of transformative AI makes \u201creference class\u201d-based outside views difficult to construct. This outside view approach contrasts with, and complements, an inside view approach, which attempts to build a detailed structural model of the world to forecast timelines (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AfH2oPHCApdKicM4m/two-year-update-on-my-personal-ai-timelines\"><u>Cotra 2020</u></a>; see also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nostalgebraist.tumblr.com/post/693718279721730048/on-bio-anchors\"><u>Nostalgebraist 2022</u></a>).</p><p><strong>Outline.&nbsp;</strong>If you want a short version of the argument, sections I and II (700 words) are the heart of the post.

Looking at a shorter time horizon, the US&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFII10\"><u>10-year</u></a> real interest rate is 1.6%, and similarly was below&nbsp;<i>negative&nbsp;</i>one percent as recently as March.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673287582/mirroredImages/8c7LycgtkypkgYjZx/mqwsjqzgremif5vgeinj.png\"></p><p><i>(Data sources used here are explained in section V.)</i></p><p>The UK in autumn 2021 sold a&nbsp;<i>50</i>-year real bond&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/uk-sells-new-2073-index-linked-gilt-with-record-low-volume-2021-11-23/\"><u>with</u></a> a -2.4% rate at the time.

Uncertainty, takeoff speeds, inequality, and stocks</u></strong></h1><p>In this section we briefly consider some potentially important complications.</p><p><strong>Uncertainty.&nbsp;</strong>The Euler equation and the intuition described above assumed&nbsp;<i>certainty</i> about AI timelines, but taking into account uncertainty does not change the core logic. With uncertainty about the future economic growth rate, then the real interest rate reflects the&nbsp;<i>expected</i> future economic growth rate, where importantly the expectation is taken over the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk-neutral_measure\"><u>risk-neutral measure</u></a>: in brief, probabilities of different states are reweighted by their marginal utility. We return to this in our quantitative model below.</p><p><strong>Takeoff speeds.</strong> Nothing in the logic above relating growth to real rates depends on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/vwLxd6hhFvPbvKmBH/yudkowsky-and-christiano-discuss-takeoff-speeds\"><u>slow vs. fast takeoff speed</u></a>; the argument can be reread under either assumption and nothing changes. Likewise, when considering the case of aligned AI, rates should be elevated whether economic growth starts to rise more rapidly&nbsp;<i>before</i> advanced AI is developed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/aFaKhG86tTrKvtAnT/against-gdp-as-a-metric-for-timelines-and-takeoff-speeds\"><u>or only does so afterwards</u></a>. What matters is that GDP \u2013 or really, consumption \u2013&nbsp;<i>ends up</i> high within the time horizon under consideration. As long as future consumption will be high within the time horizon, then there is less motive to save today (\u201cconsumption smoothing\u201d), pushing up the real rate.</p><p><strong>Inequality.&nbsp;</strong>The logic above assumed that the development of transformative AI affects everyone equally. This is a reasonable assumption in the case of unaligned AI, where it is thought that all of humanity will be evaporated. However, when considering&nbsp;<i>aligned</i> AI, it may be thought that only some will benefit, and therefore real interest rates will not move much: if only an elite Silicon Valley minority is expected to have utopian wealth next year, then everyone else may very well still choose to save today.</p><p>It is indeed the case that inequality in expected gains from transformative AI would&nbsp;<i>dampen</i> the impact on real rates, but this argument should not be overrated. First, asset prices can be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/680996\"><u>crudely</u></a> thought of as reflecting a&nbsp;<i>wealth-weighted average</i> across investors. Even if only an elite minority becomes fabulously wealthy, it is&nbsp;<i>their</i> desire for consumption smoothing which will end up dominating the determination of the real rate. Second,&nbsp;<i>truly</i> transformative AI leading to 30%+ economy-wide growth (\u201c<a href=\"https://moores.samaltman.com/\"><u>Moore\u2019s law for everything</u></a>\u201d) would not be possible without having economy-wide benefits.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Stocks</strong>. One naive objection to the argument here would be the claim that real interest rates sound like an odd, arbitrary asset price to consider; certainly stock prices are the asset price that receive the most media attention.</p><p>In <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8c7LycgtkypkgYjZx/agi-and-the-emh-markets-are-not-expecting-aligned-or#Appendix_1__Against_using_stock_prices_to_forecast_AI_timelines\">appendix 1</a>, we explain that the level of the real interest rate affects&nbsp;<i>every</i> asset price: stocks for instance reflect the&nbsp;<i>present discounted value</i> of future dividends; and real interest rates&nbsp;<i>determine</i>&nbsp;<i>the discount rate used to discount</i> those future dividends. Thus,&nbsp;<u>if real interest rates are \u2018wrong\u2019,&nbsp;</u><i><u>every</u></i><u> asset price is wrong. If real interest rates are wrong,&nbsp;</u><i><u>a lot</u></i><u> of money is on the table, a point to which we return in section X</u>.</p><p>We also argue that stock prices in particular are not a useful indicator of market expectations of AI timelines. Above all, high stock prices of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/robertwiblin/status/1577782210568003585\"><u>chipmakers</u></a> or companies like Alphabet (parent of DeepMind) could only reflect expectations for&nbsp;<i>aligned</i> AI and could not be informative of the risk of&nbsp;<i>unaligned</i> AI. Additionally, as we explain further in the appendix, aligned AI could even&nbsp;<i>lower</i> equity prices, by pushing up discount rates.</p><h1><strong><u>IV. Historical data on interest rates supports the theory: preliminaries</u></strong></h1><p>In section I, we gave theoretical&nbsp;<i>intuition</i> for why higher expected growth or higher existential risk would result in higher interest rates: expectations for such high growth or mortality risk would lead people to want to save less and borrow more today. In this section and the next two, we showcase some simple empirical evidence that the predicted relationships hold in the available data.</p><p><strong>Measuring real rates.</strong> To compare historical real interest rates to historical growth, we need to measure real interest rates.</p><p>Most bonds historically have been&nbsp;<i>nominal</i>, where the yield is not adjusted for changes in inflation. Therefore, the vast majority of research studying real interest rates starts with&nbsp;<i>nominal</i> interest rates, attempts to construct an estimate of expected inflation using some statistical model, and then subtracts this estimate of expected inflation from the nominal rate to get an&nbsp;<i>estimated</i> real interest rate. However,&nbsp;<u>constructing measures of inflation expectations is extremely difficult, and as a result most papers in this literature are not very informative</u>.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, most bonds historically have had some risk of default. Adjusting for this default premium is also extremely difficult, which in particular complicates analysis of long-run interest rate trends.&nbsp;</p><p>The difficulty in measuring real rates is one of the main causes, in our view, of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/04/tyler-cowens-three-laws.html\"><u>Tyler Cowen\u2019s Third Law</u></a>: \u201call propositions about real interest rates are wrong\u201d. Throughout this piece, we are badly violating this (G\u00f6delian) Third Law. In <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8c7LycgtkypkgYjZx/agi-and-the-emh-markets-are-not-expecting-aligned-or#Appendix_2__Tyler_Cowen_s_Third_Law\">appendix 2</a>, we expand on our argument that the source of Tyler\u2019s Third Law is measurement issues in the extant literature, together with some separate, frequent conceptual errors.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Our approach.</strong> We take a more direct approach.</p><p><strong>Real rates.&nbsp;</strong>For our primary analysis, we instead use market real interest rates from&nbsp;<i>inflation-linked bonds</i>. Because we use interest rates&nbsp;<i>directly</i> from inflation-linked bonds \u2013 instead of constructing shoddy estimates of inflation expectations to use with nominal interest rates \u2013 this approach avoids the measurement issue just discussed (and, we argue, allows us to escape Cowen\u2019s Third Law).</p><p><u>To our knowledge, prior literature has not used real rates from inflation-linked bonds only because these bonds are comparatively new</u>. Using inflation-linked bonds confines our sample to the last ~20 years in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2008/200805/200805abs.html\"><u>US</u></a>, the last ~30 in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/yield-curves\"><u>UK</u></a>/Australia/Canada. Before that, inflation-linked bonds didn\u2019t exist. Other countries have data for even fewer years and less liquid bond markets.</p><p>(The yields on inflation-linked bonds are not perfect measures of real rates, because of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.frbsf.org/economic-research/files/wp08-34bk.pdf\"><u>risk premia</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.basilhalperin.com/essays/efficient-restaurant-hypothesis-mental-model-finance-food.html\"><u>liquidity issues</u></a>, and some&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ijcb.org/journal/ijcb12q4a2.pdf\"><u>subtle</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-financial-and-quantitative-analysis/article/abs/tips-from-tips-the-informational-content-of-treasury-inflationprotected-security-prices/76EBC9C8B0FEF951704DCCA4A4781CEC\"><u>issues</u></a> with the way these securities are structured. You can build a model and attempt to strip out these issues; here, we will just use the raw rates. If you prefer to think of these empirics as \u201care&nbsp;<i>inflation-linked bond yields</i> predictive of future real growth\u201d rather than \u201care&nbsp;<i>real rates</i> predictive of future real growth\u201d, that interpretation is still sufficient for the logic of this post.)</p><p><strong>Nominal rates.</strong> Because there are only 20 or 30 years of data on&nbsp;<i>real</i> interest rates from inflation-linked bonds, we supplement our data by also considering unadjusted&nbsp;<i>nominal</i> interest rates. Nominal interest rates reflect real interest rates plus inflation expectations, so it is not appropriate to compare nominal interest rates to&nbsp;<i>real</i> GDP growth.&nbsp;</p><p>Instead, analogously to comparing&nbsp;<i>real</i> interest rates to&nbsp;<i>real</i> GDP growth, we compare&nbsp;<i>nominal</i> interest rates to&nbsp;<i>nominal</i> GDP growth. The latter is not an ideal comparison under economic theory \u2013 and inflation variability could swamp real growth variability \u2013 but we argue that this approach is simple and transparent.</p><p>Looking at nominal rates allows us to have a very large sample of countries for many decades: we use <a href=\"https://data.oecd.org/interest/long-term-interest-rates.htm\">OECD data</a> on nominal rates available for up to 70 years across 39 countries.<br>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong><u>V. Historical data on interest rates supports the theory: graphs</u></strong></h1><p>The goal of this section is to show that real interest rates have correlated with future real economic growth, and secondarily, that nominal interest rates have correlated with future nominal economic growth. We also briefly discuss the state of empirical evidence on the correlation between real rates and existential risk.</p><p><strong>Real rates vs. real growth.&nbsp;</strong>A first cut at the data suggests that, indeed, higher real rates today predict higher real growth in the future:<br>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673287582/mirroredImages/8c7LycgtkypkgYjZx/akzok3cxjeis8rvwlq2g.png\"></p><p>To see how to read these graphs, take the left-most graph (\u201c10-year horizon\u201d) for example. The x-axis shows the level of the real interest rate, as reflected on 10-year inflation linked bonds. The y-axis shows average real GDP growth over the&nbsp;<i>following</i> 10 years.</p><p>The middle and right hand graphs show the same, at the 15-year and 20-year horizons. The scatter plot shows all available data for the US (<a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/feds/2008/200805/200805abs.html\">since 1999</a>), the UK (<a href=\"https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/statistics/yield-curves\">since 1985</a>), Australia (since 1995), and Canada (since 1991). (Data for Australia and Canada is only available at the 10-year horizon, and comes from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://augurlabs.com/curve/\"><u>Augur Labs</u></a>.)</p><p>Eyeballing the figure,&nbsp;<u>there appears to be a strong relationship between real interest rates today and future economic growth over the next 10-20 years</u>.</p><p>To our knowledge, this simple stylized fact is novel.</p><p><strong>Caveats.&nbsp;</strong>\u201cEyeballing it\u201d is not a formal econometric method; but, this is a blog post not a journal article (TIABPNAJA). We do not perform any formal statistical tests here, but we do want to acknowledge some important statistical points and other caveats.</p><p>First, the data points in the scatter plot are not statistically independent: real rates and growth are both persistent variables; the data points contain overlapping periods; and growth rates in these four countries are correlated. These issues are evident even from eyeballing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/basilhalperin/agi_emh/main/r_figs/ts_r_vs_gdp_10.png\"><u>the time series</u></a>. Second, of course this relationship is not causally identified: we do not have exogenous variation in real growth rates. (If you have ideas for identifying the causal effect of higher real growth expectations on real rates, we would love to discuss with you.)</p><p>Relatedly, many other things are changing in the world which are likely to affect real rates.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.forourposterity.com/best-chad-jones-papers/\"><u>Population growth</u></a> is slowing,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://worthwhile.typepad.com/worthwhile_canadian_initi/2013/10/asset-prices-and-the-retirement-revolution.html\"><u>retirement</u></a> is lengthening, the population is&nbsp;<a href=\"http://web.stanford.edu/~aauclert/demowealth21.pdf\"><u>aging</u></a>. But under AI-driven \u201cexplosive\u201d growth \u2013 again say 30%+ annual growth, following the excellent analysis of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/could-advanced-ai-drive-explosive-economic-growth\"><u>Davidson (2021)</u></a> \u2013 then, we might reasonably expect that this massive of an increase in the growth rate would drown out the impact of any other factors.</p><p><strong>Nominal rates vs. nominal growth.</strong> Turning now to evidence from nominal interest rates, recall that the usefulness of this exercise is that while there only exists 20 or 30 years of data on&nbsp;<i>real</i> interest rates for two countries, there is much more data on&nbsp;<i>nominal</i> interest rates.</p><p>We simply take all available data on 10-year nominal rates from the set of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://data.oecd.org/interest/long-term-interest-rates.htm\"><u>39 OECD countries since 1954</u></a>. The following scatterplot compares the 10-year nominal interest versus nominal GDP growth over the succeeding ten years by country:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1673287582/mirroredImages/8c7LycgtkypkgYjZx/ht0qqemuzdcm2fqqqyvs.png\" alt=\"Chart, scatter chart\n\nDescription automatically generated\"></p><p>Again, there is a strong positive \u2013 if certainly not perfect \u2013 relationship. (For example, the outlier brown dots at the bottom of the graph are Greece, whose high interest rates despite negative NGDP growth reflect high default risk during an economic depression.)&nbsp;</p><p>The same set of nontrivial caveats apply to this analysis as above.</p><p>We consider this data from nominal rates to be significantly weaker evidence than the evidence from real rates, but corroboration nonetheless.</p><p><strong>Backing out market-implied timelines.</strong> Taking the univariate pooled OLS results from the real rate data&nbsp;<i>far</i> too seriously, the fact that the 10-year real rate in the US ended 2022 at 1.6% would predict average annual real GDP growth of 2.6% over the next 10 years in the US;<strong>&nbsp;</strong>the analogous interest rate of -0.2% in the UK would predict 0.7% annual growth over the next 10 years in the UK. Such growth rates, clearly, are not compatible with the arrival of transformative aligned AI within this horizon.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong><u>VI. Empirical evidence on real rates and mortality risk</u></strong></h1><p>We have argued that in the theory, real rates should be higher in the face of high economic growth or high mortality risk; empirically, so far, we have only shown a relationship between real rates and growth, but not between real rates and mortality.</p><p>Showing that real rates accurately reflect changes in existential risk is very difficult, because there is no word-of-god measurement of how existential risk has evolved over time.</p><p>We would be very interested in pursuing new empirical research examining \u201casset pricing under existential risk\u201d. In <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8c7LycgtkypkgYjZx/agi-and-the-emh-markets-are-not-expecting-aligned-or#Appendix_3__Asset_pricing_under_existential_risk__a_literature_review\">appendix 3</a>, we perform a scorched-earth literature review and find essentially zero existing empirical evidence on real rates and&nbsp;<i>existential</i> risks.</p><p><strong>Disaster risk.&nbsp;</strong>In particular, the extant literature does not study existential risks but instead \u201cmerely\u201d&nbsp;<i>disaster risks</i>, under which real assets are devastated but humanity is not exterminated.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/pol.5.4.306\"><u>Disaster risks</u></a> do&nbsp;<i>not</i> necessarily raise real rates \u2013 indeed, such risks are thought to&nbsp;<i>lower</i> real rates due to precautionary savings. That notwithstanding, some highlights of the appendix review include&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2117594.pdf?\"><u>a small set of papers</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/2600866.pdf\"><u>finding</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1465-7295.1990.tb00824.x\"><u>that</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w0887/w0887.pdf\"><u>individuals</u></a> with a higher perceived risk of nuclear conflict during the Cold War saved less, as well as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://davidandrewfiner.com/jmp/\"><u>a paper</u></a> noting that equities which were headquartered in cities more likely to be targeted by Soviet missiles did worse during the Cuban missile crisis (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1062976922000217\"><u>see also</u></a>). Our assessment is that these and the other available papers on&nbsp;<i>disaster</i> risks discussed in the appendix have severe limitations for the purposes here.</p><p><strong>Individual mortality risk.&nbsp;</strong>We judge that the best evidence on this topic comes instead from examining the relationship between&nbsp;<i>individual mortality risk</i> and&nbsp;<i>savings/investment</i> behavior. The logic we provided was that if humanity will be extinct next year, then there is no reason to save, pushing up the real rate. Similar logic says that at the&nbsp;<i>individual</i> level, a higher risk of death for any reason should lead to lower savings and less investment in human capital. Examples of lower savings at the&nbsp;<i>individual&nbsp;</i>level need not raise interest rates at the&nbsp;<i>economy-wide</i> level, but do provide evidence for the&nbsp;<i>mechanism</i> whereby extinction risk should lead to lower saving and thus higher interest rates.&nbsp;</p><p>One example comes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20150369\"><u>from Malawi</u></a>, where the provision of a new AIDS therapy caused a significant increase in life expectancy. Using spatial and temporal variation in where and when these therapeutics were rolled out, it was found that increased life expectancy results in more savings and more human capital investment in the form of education spending. Another experiment in Malawi&nbsp;<a href=\"https://repository.upenn.edu/psc_publications/39/\"><u>provided information</u></a> to correct pessimistic priors about life expectancy, and found that higher life expectancy directly caused more investment in agriculture and livestock.</p><p>A third example comes from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/23469683\"><u>testing for Huntington\u2019s disease</u></a>, a disease which causes a meaningful drop in life expectancy to around 60 years. Using variation in when people are diagnosed with Huntington\u2019s, it has been found that those who learn they carry the gene for Huntington\u2019s earlier are 30 percentage points less likely to finish college, which is a significant fall in their human capital investment.</p><p>Studying the effect on savings and real rates from increased life expectancy&nbsp;<i>at the population level</i> is potentially intractable, but would be interesting to consider further. Again, in our assessment, the best empirical evidence available right now comes from the research on individual \u201cexistential\u201d risks and suggests that real rates should increase with existential risk.</p><h1><strong><u>VII. Plugging the Cotra probabilities into a simple quantitative model of real interest rates predicts very high rates</u></strong></h1><p>Section VI used&nbsp;<u>historical data</u> to go from&nbsp;<i>the current real rate</i> to a very crude&nbsp;<i>market-implied forecast</i> of growth rates; in this section, we instead use a&nbsp;<u>model</u> to go from&nbsp;<i>existing forecasts</i> of AI timelines to&nbsp;<i>timeline-implied real rates.</i> We aim to show that under short AI timelines, real interest rates would be unrealistically elevated.</p><p>This is a useful exercise for three reasons. First, the historical data is only able to speak to growth forecasts, and therefore only able to provide a forecast under the possibly incorrect assumption of&nbsp;<i>aligned</i> AI. Second, the empirical forecast assumes a&nbsp;<i>linear&nbsp;</i>relationship between the real rate and growth, which may not be reasonable for a massive change caused by transformative AI. Third and quite important, the historical data cannot transparently tell us anything about uncertainty and the market\u2019s beliefs about the full probability&nbsp;<i>distribution</i> of AI timelines.</p><p>We&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10ULqcFRKXD-UT5JYDMrQeLtUfzkyzNUxCPQvYqbEdig/edit#gid=850885346\"><u>use</u></a> the canonical (and nonlinear) version of the Euler equation \u2013 the model discussed in section I \u2013 but now allow for&nbsp;<i>uncertainty</i> on both how soon transformative AI will be developed and whether or not it will be aligned. The model takes as its key inputs (1) a probability of transformative AI each year, and (2) a probability that such technology is aligned.</p><p>The model is a simple application of the stochastic Euler equation under an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isoelastic_utility\"><u>isoelastic utility function</u></a>. We use the following as a baseline, before considering alternative probabilities:</p><ul><li>We use smoothed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AfH2oPHCApdKicM4m/two-year-update-on-my-personal-ai-timelines\"><strong><u>Cotra (2022)</u></strong></a><strong> probabilities for transformative AI</strong> over the next 30 years: a 2% yearly chance until 2030, a 3% yearly chance through 2036, and a 4% yearly chance through 2052.</li><li>We use the&nbsp;<strong>FTX Future Fund\u2019s median&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://archive.ph/9UQTA\"><strong><u>estimate</u></strong></a><strong> of 15% for the probability that AI is&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>un</strong></i><strong>aligned</strong> conditional on the development of transformative AI.</li><li>With the arrival of&nbsp;<i>aligned</i> AI, we use the&nbsp;<strong>Davidson (2020) assumption of 30% annual economic growth</strong>; with the arrival of unaligned AI, we assume human extinction. In the absence of the development of transformative AI, we assume a steady 1.8% growth rate.</li><li>We calibrate the pure rate of subjective time preference to 0.01 and the consumption smoothing parameter (i.e. inverse of the elasticity of intertemporal substitution) as 1, following the economic literature.</li></ul><p>Thus, to summarize: by default, GDP grows at 1.8% per year. Every year, there is some probability (based on Cotra) that transformative AI is developed. If it is developed, there is a 15% probability the world ends, and an 85% chance GDP growth jumps to 30% per year.</p><p>We have built a spreadsheet&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/10ULqcFRKXD-UT5JYDMrQeLtUfzkyzNUxCPQvYqbEdig/edit#gid=850885346\"><u>here</u></a> that allows you to tinker with the numbers yourself, such as adjusting the growth rate under aligned AI, to see what your timelines and probability of alignment would imply for the real interest rate. (It also contains the full Euler equation formula generating the results, for those who want the mathematical details.) We first estimate real rates under the baseline calibration above, before considering variations in the critical inputs.</p><p><strong>Baseline results.</strong> The model predicts that under&nbsp;<i>zero&nbsp;</i>probability of transformative AI, the real rate at any horizon would be 2.8%. In comparison,&nbsp;<u>under the baseline calibration just described based on Cotra timelines, the real rate at a 30-year horizon would be pushed up to 5.9% \u2013 roughly three percentage points higher</u>.</p><p>For comparison, the 30-year real rate in the US is currently 1.6%.&nbsp;</p><p>While the simple Euler equation somewhat overpredicts the level of the real interest rate even under zero probability of transformative AI \u2013 the 2.8% in the model versus the 1.6% in the data \u2013 this overprediction is explainable by the radical simplicity of the model that we use and is a known issue in the literature. Adding other factors (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precautionary_savings\"><u>precautionary savings</u></a>) to the model would lower the level.

Even with a 20% chance of stagnation by 2053 (higher than realistic), under Cotra timelines, the model generates a 2.1% increase in 30-year rates.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Recent market movements.&nbsp;</strong>Real rates have increased around two percentage points since the start of 2022, with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFII30\"><u>30-year real rate</u></a> moving from -0.4% to 1.6%, approximately the pre-covid level. This is a large enough move to merit discussion. While this rise in long-term real rates could reflect changing market expectations for timelines, it seems much more plausible that high inflation, the Russia-Ukraine war, and monetary policy tightening have together worked to drive up short-term real rates and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/notes/feds-notes/tips-from-tips-update-and-discussions-20190521.html\"><u>the risk premium on long-term real rates</u></a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong><u>IX. Financial markets are the most powerful information aggregators produced by the universe (so far)</u></strong></h1><p>Should we update on the fact that markets are not expecting very short timelines?&nbsp;</p><p>Probably!</p><p>As a prior, we think that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1455949250320240641\"><u>market efficiency is reasonable</u></a>. We do not try to provide a full defense of the efficient markets hypothesis (EMH) in this piece given that it has been debated ad nauseum elsewhere, but here is a scaffolding of what such an argument would look like.</p><p>Loosely, the EMH says that the current price of any security incorporates all public information about it, and as such,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1278486324018704384\"><u>you should not expect to systematically make money by trading securities</u></a>.</p><p>This is simply a no-arbitrage condition, and certainly no more radical than supply and demand: if something is over- or under-priced, you\u2019ll take action based on that belief until you no longer believe it. In other words,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1426612130975870981\"><u>you\u2019ll buy and sell it until you think the price is right</u></a>. Otherwise, there would be an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://yudkowsky.tumblr.com/writing/inexploitability\"><u>unexploited opportunity</u></a> for profit that was being left on the table, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/h24JGbmweNpWZfBkM/markets-are-anti-inductive\"><u>there are no free lunches when the market is in equilibrium</u></a>.</p><p>As a corollary, the current price of a security should be the best available risk-adjusted predictor of its future price. Notice we didn\u2019t say that the price is equal to the \u201ccorrect\u201d fundamental value. In fact, the current price is almost certainly wrong. What we did say is that it is the best guess, i.e. no one knows if it should be higher or lower.</p><p>Testing this hypothesis is difficult, in the same way that testing any equilibrium condition is difficult. Not only is the equilibrium always changing, there is also a joint hypothesis problem which&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2325486\"><u>Fama (1970)</u></a> outlined: comparing actual asset prices to \u201ccorrect\u201d theoretical asset prices means you are simultaneously testing whatever asset pricing model you choose, alongside the EMH.</p><p>In this sense, it makes no sense to talk about \u201ctesting\u201d the EMH. Rather, the question is how quickly prices converge to the limit of market efficiency. In other words, how fast is information diffusion? Our position is that for most things, this is pretty fast!</p><p>Here are a few heuristics that support our position:</p><ol><li>For our purposes, the earlier evidence on the link between real rates and growth is a highly relevant example of market efficiency.</li><li>There are notable examples of markets seeming to be eerily good at forecasting hard-to-anticipate events:<ol><li>In the wake of the Challenger explosion, despite no definitive public information being released,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://wisdomofcrowds.blogspot.com/2009/12/stock-market-reaction-to-challenger.html\"><u>the market</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://slate.com/business/2003/08/the-disaster-market.html\"><u>seems to have identified</u></a> which firm was responsible.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0929119914000546#f0005\"><u>Economist Armen Alchian observed</u></a> that the stock price of lithium producers spiked 461% following the public announcement of the first hydrogen bomb tests in 1954, while the prices of producers of other radioactive metals were flat. He circulated a paper within RAND, where he was working, identifying lithium as the material used in the tests, before the paper was suppressed by leadership who were apparently aware that indeed lithium was used. The market was prescient even though&nbsp;<i>zero&nbsp;</i>public information was released about lithium\u2019s usage.&nbsp;</li></ol></li></ol><p>Remember: if real interest rates are wrong,&nbsp;<i>all</i> financial assets are mispriced. If real interest rates \u201cshould\u201d rise three percentage points or more, that is easily hundreds of billions of dollars worth of revaluations. It is unlikely that sharp market participants are leaving billions of dollars on the table.</p><h1><strong><u>X. If markets are not efficient, you could be earning alpha and philanthropists could be borrowing</u></strong></h1><p>While our prior in favor of efficiency is fairly strong, the market could be currently<i>&nbsp;</i>failing to anticipate transformative AI, due to various&nbsp;<a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/shleifer/files/limitsofarbitrage.pdf\"><u>limits to arbitrage</u></a>.</p><p>However, if you do believe the market is currently wrong about the probability of short timelines, then we now argue there are two courses of action you should consider taking:</p><ol><li>Bet on real rates rising (\u201cget rich or die trying\u201d)</li><li>Borrow today, including in order to fund philanthropy (\u201cimpatient philanthropy\u201d)</li></ol><h2><u>1. Bet on real rates rising (\u201cget rich or die trying\u201d)</u></h2><p>Under the logic argued above, if you genuinely believe that AI timelines are short, then you should consider putting your money where your mouth is: bet that real rates will rise when the market updates, and potentially earn a lot of money if markets correct. Shorting (or going underweight) government debt is the simplest way of expressing this view.</p><p>Indeed, AI safety researcher Paul Christiano has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/KdxGwxwY3t7iw9xjB/three-impacts-of-machine-intelligence?commentId=aYCNP5PgDYsZpxsbX#aYCNP5PgDYsZpxsbX\"><u>written publicly</u></a> that he is (or was) short 30-year government bonds.</p><p>If short timelines are your true belief in your heart of hearts, and not merely a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CqyJzDZWvGhhFJ7dY/belief-in-belief\"><u>belief in a belief</u></a>, then you should seriously consider how much money you could earn here and what you could do with those resources.</p><p><strong>Implementing the trade.</strong> For retail investors, betting against treasuries via ETFs is perhaps simplest. Such trades can be done easily with retail brokers, like Schwab.</p><p>(i) For example, one could simply short the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pimco.com/en-us/investments/etf/15-year-us-tips-index-exchange-traded-fund/\"><u>LTPZ ETF</u></a>, which holds long-term real US government debt (effective duration: 20 years).</p><p>(ii) Alternatively, if you would prefer to avoid engaging in shorting yourself, there are ETFs which will do the shorting for you, with nominal bonds:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.proshares.com/our-etfs/leveraged-and-inverse/tbf\"><u>TBF</u></a> is an ETF which is short 20+ year treasuries (duration: 18 years);&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.proshares.com/our-etfs/leveraged-and-inverse/tbt\"><u>TBT</u></a> is the same, but levered 2x; and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.proshares.com/our-etfs/leveraged-and-inverse/ttt\"><u>TTT</u></a> is the same, but levered 3x. There are a number of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://etfdb.com/etfdb-category/inverse-bonds/\"><u>other similar options</u></a>. Because these ETFs do the shorting for you, all you need to do is purchase shares of the ETFs.</p><p><strong>Back of the envelope estimate.</strong> A rough estimate of how much money is on the table, just from shorting the US treasury bond market&nbsp;<i>alone</i>, suggests&nbsp;<u>there is easily $1 trillion in value at stake from betting that rates will rise</u>.</p><ul><li>In response to a 1 percentage point rise in interest rates, the price of a bond falls in percentage terms by its \u201c<a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/fp/documents/understanding_duration.pdf\"><i><u>duration</u></i></a>\u201d, to a first-order approximation.</li><li>The average value-weighted duration of (privately-held) US treasuries&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2022/07/27/projecting-the-structure-of-us-treasury-debt/\"><u>is approximately 4 years</u></a>.</li><li>So, to a first-order approximation, if rates rise by 3 percentage points, then the value of treasuries will fall by 12% (that is, 3*4).</li><li>The market cap of (privately-held) treasuries&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dallasfed.org/research/econdata/govdebt#data\"><u>is approximately $17 trillion</u></a>.</li><li>Thus, if rates rise by 3 percentage points, then the total value of treasuries can be expected to fall by $2.04 trillion (that is, 12%*17 trillion).</li><li>Slightly more than half (55%) of the interest rate sensitivity of the treasury market&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/blog/up-front/2022/07/27/projecting-the-structure-of-us-treasury-debt/\"><u>comes from</u></a> bonds with maturity beyond 10 years. Assuming that the 3 percentage point rise occurs only at this horizon, and rounding down, we arrive at the $1 trillion estimate.</li></ul><p>Alternatively, returning to the LTPZ ETF with its duration of 20 years, a 3 percentage point rise in rates would cause its value to fall by 60%. Using the 3x levered TTT with duration of 18 years, a 3 percentage point rise in rates would imply a mouth-watering cumulative return of 162%.</p><p>While fully fleshing out the trade analysis is beyond the scope of this post, this illustration gives an idea of how large the possibilities are.</p><p>The alternative to this order-of-magnitude estimate would be to build a complete bond pricing model to estimate more precisely the expected returns of shorting treasuries. This would need to take into account e.g. the convexity of price changes with interest rate movements, the varied maturities of outstanding bonds, and the different varieties of instruments issued by the Treasury. Further refinements would include trading derivatives (e.g. interest rate futures) instead of shorting bonds directly, for capital efficiency, and using leverage to increase expected returns.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, the analysis could be extended beyond the US government debt market, again since changes to real interest rates would plausibly impact the price of every<i>&nbsp;</i>asset: stocks, commodities, real estate,&nbsp;<i>everything</i>.</p><p>(If you would be interested in fully scoping out possible trades, we would be interested in talking.)</p><p><strong>Trade risk and foom risk.</strong> We want to be clear that \u2013 unless you are risk neutral, or can borrow without penalty at the risk-free rate, or believe in short timelines with 100% probability \u2013 then such a bet would not be a free lunch: this is not an \u201carbitrage\u201d in the technical sense of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Afwaj6sGfxcQZrmYF/chapter-4-the-efficient-market-hypothesis\"><u>risk-free profit</u></a>. One risk is that the market moves in the other direction in the short term, before correcting, and that you are unable to roll over your position for liquidity reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>The other risk that could motivate not making this bet is the risk that the market \u2013 for some unspecified reason \u2013 never has a chance to correct, because (1) transformative AI ends up&nbsp;<i>unaligned&nbsp;</i>and (2) humanity\u2019s conversion into paperclips occurs&nbsp;<i>overnight</i>. This would prevent the market from ever \u201cwaking up\u201d.</p><p>However, to be clear, expecting this specific scenario requires both:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Buying into specific stories about how takeoff will occur: specifically, Yudkowskian&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/the-hanson-yudkowsky-ai-foom-debate\"><u>foom</u></a>-type scenarios with fast takeoff.</li><li>Having a lot of skepticism about the optimization forces pushing financial markets towards informational efficiency.</li></ol><p>You should be sure that your beliefs are actually congruent with these requirements, if you want to refuse to bet that real rates will rise. Additionally, we will see that the second suggestion in this section (\u201cimpatient philanthropy\u201d) is not affected by the possibility of foom scenarios.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><u>2. Borrow today, including in order to fund philanthropy&nbsp; (\u201cimpatient philanthropy\u201d)</u></h2><p>If prevailing interest rates are lower than your subjective discount rate \u2013 which is the case if you think markets are underestimating prospects for transformative AI \u2013 then simple cost-benefit analysis says you should save less or even borrow today.</p><p><strong>An illustrative example.</strong> As an extreme example to illustrate this argument, imagine that you think that there is a 50% chance that humanity will be extinct next year, and otherwise with certainty you will have the same income next year as you do this year. Suppose the market real interest rate is 0%. That means that if you borrow $10 today, then in expectation you only need to pay $5 off, since 50% of the time you expect to be dead.</p><p>It is only if the market real rate is 100% \u2013 so that your $10 loan requires paying back $20 next year, or exactly $10 in expectation \u2013 that you are indifferent about borrowing. If the market real rate is less than 100%, then you want to borrow.&nbsp;<u>If interest rates are \u201ctoo low\u201d from your perspective, then on the margin this should encourage you to borrow</u>, or at least save less.</p><p>Note that this logic is not affected by whether or not the market will \u201ccorrect\u201d and real rates will rise before everyone dies, unlike the logic above for trading.</p><p><strong>Borrowing to fund philanthropy today.</strong> While you may want to borrow today simply to fund wild parties, a natural alternative is: borrow today, locking in \u201ctoo low\u201d interest rates, in order to fund philanthropy today. For example: to fund AI safety work.</p><p>We can call this strategy \u201cimpatient philanthropy\u201d, in analogy to the concept of \u201c<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/phil-trammell-patient-philanthropy/\"><u>patient philanthropy</u></a>\u201d.</p><p>This is not a call for philanthropists to radically rethink their cost-benefit analyses. Instead, we merely point out:&nbsp;<u>ensure that your financial planning properly accounts for any difference between&nbsp;</u><i><u>your</u></i><u> discount rate and&nbsp;</u><i><u>the market real rate at which you can borrow</u></i>. You should not be using the market real rate to do your financial planning. If you have a higher effective discount rate due to your AI timelines, that could imply that you should be borrowing today to fund philanthropic work.</p><p><strong>Relationship to impatient philanthropy.</strong> The logic here has a similar flavor to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/phil-trammell-patient-philanthropy/\">Phil Trammell\u2019s \u201cpatient philanthropy\u201d argument</a> (<a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/wp-content/uploads/Trammell-Dynamic-Public-Good-Provision-under-Time-Preference-Heterogeneity.pdf\"><u>Trammell 2021</u></a>) \u2013 but with a sign flipped. Longtermist philanthropists with a zero discount rate, who live in a world with a positive real interest rate, should be willing to save all of their resources for a long time to earn that interest, rather than spending those resources today on philanthropic projects. Short-timeliners have a higher discount rate than the market, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/phil-trammell-patient-philanthropy/#what-about-groups-who-have-a-particular-sense-of-urgency-014046\"><u>therefore</u></a> should be&nbsp;<i>im</i>patient philanthropists.</p><p>(The point here is not an exact analog to Trammell 2021, because the paper there considers strategic game theoretic considerations and also takes the real rate as exogenous; here, the considerations are not strategic and the endogeneity of the real rate is the critical point.)</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong><u>XI. Conclusion: outside views vs. inside views &amp; future work</u></strong></h1><p>We do not claim to have special technical insight into forecasting the likely timeline for the development of transformative artificial intelligence: we do not present an inside view on AI timelines.&nbsp;</p><p>However, we do think that market efficiency provides a powerful&nbsp;<i>outside view</i> for forecasting AI timelines and for making financial decisions. Based on prevailing real interest rates, the market seems to be strongly rejecting timelines of less than ten years, and does not seem to be placing particularly high odds on the development of transformative AI even 30-50 years from now.</p><p>We argue that market efficiency is a reasonable benchmark, and consequently, this forecast serves as a useful prior for AI timelines. If markets are wrong, on the other hand, then there is an enormous amount of money on the table from betting that real interest rates will rise. In either case, this market-based approach offers a useful framework: either for forecasting timelines, or for asset allocation.</p><p><strong>Opportunities for future work.</strong> We could have put 1000 more hours into the empirical side or the model, but, TIABPNAJA. Future work we would be interested in collaborating on or seeing includes:</p><ol><li>More careful empirical analyses of the relationship between real rates and growth. In particular, (1) analysis of data samples with larger variation in growth rates (e.g. with the Industrial Revolution, China or the East Asian Tigers), where a credible measure of&nbsp;<i>real&nbsp;</i>interest rates can be used; and (2)&nbsp;<i>causally identified&nbsp;</i>estimates of the relationship between real rates and growth, rather than correlations. Measuring historical real rates is the key challenge, and the main reason why we have not tried to address these here.</li><li>Any empirical analysis of how real rates vary with changing existential risk.

Melinda Gates is doing very similar things that EA orgs are trying to do, and any time the FT (just for example) writes about her it's always with a respectful and even admiring tone (which I agree with). Meanwhile, anything they write on EA comes with a very negative slant, and this was before the damage suffered from associations with SBF and FTX.&nbsp;</p><p>Part of this is genuinely unfair, but certainly the name Effective Altruism does not do us any favours. It has a certain air of inherent criticism - the reason we are different from other altruists is that we do altruism effectively. I think this is needlessly confrontational as I don't think it accurately captures the true difference between how EAs think about giving money and how 'the average' person or institution does. Or at very least there would be less confrontational ways to get a similarly accurate message across. I was spurred to write this piece now by the recent similar discussions in the comments of this post from Helen:</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/FpjQMYQmS3rWewZ83/effective-altruism-is-a-question-not-an-ideology\">https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/FpjQMYQmS3rWewZ83/effective-altruism-is-a-question-not-an-ideology&nbsp;</a></p><p>Effectiveness-minded altruist and rational altruists were two suggestions that I liked from that discussion, but again I feel carry the same tone of implied superiority. Meanwhile Evidence Based Altruist isn't really a good description, because a lot of EA thought is around rational conclusions in the absence of evidence (like with long-termism). Maybe the name EA is already too entrenched to seriously consider changing, but I think it is worth at least trying to find a name that captures the core difference between this community and altruists at large, in a non threatening or offensive way.&nbsp;</p><p>I think you need the Altruism or Philanthropy identifier for obvious reasons, the words are similar enough, or at least neither is a perfect descriptor for the movement as I see it for me to have a strong preference (I appreciate others might feel differently). The more pertinent question for me is how can we define and then find words to describe the difference between us and others who give differently.&nbsp;</p><p>The core difference, for me at least, is that I am fairly indifferent on the cause that my donations benefit. This works in two dimensions. Let's say on the x-axis I don't mind where geographically or on whom demographically. On the y-axis, I have no fixed ideas about whether the money should be spent on AI safety research, or anti-malarial bednets, or even cash transfers. The reason I am not fixed to any one cause or type of problem is because I want to fund whichever of these interventions we can reasonable conclude will do the most expected good, or remove the most sentient suffering, in whatever way that measure is defined.&nbsp;</p><p>The name Effective Altruism focuses entirely on the second half of the above paragraph, but no matter how this message is framed I think it's impossible for it to not come across trite, because it is a call-out of all non-effective charities etc. So perhaps it would be more constructive to have a name that focuses on the first half of the paragraph. For example, something like Cause Agnostic Altruism (Philanthropy?).&nbsp;</p><p>Likely someone can do much better with the name, but I'm quite attached to the idea of changing the emphasis to this side of what we do. I think it sparks questions like 'oh weird, what does that even mean?', and that sets me up to talk about the difference between guide dogs and Sightsavers etc. etc. Maybe I'm wrong, but it just seems to set up for a conversation where I'm much less likely to come across like a dick! &nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>p.s. apologies if this should have been a comment on that post, it felt to me like the main thrust of that was a conversation about what EA is, and the naming was a side issue, whereas I felt the naming discussion was worthy of it's own discussion.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "jamie_cassidy"}}, {"_id": "Bb7yv3nqspyCxBy9r", "title": "Save community building operations time with the EA Hungary care package and other resources", "postedAt": "2023-01-09T15:02:57.331Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Hey all!\ud83d\udc4b</p><p>I am part of the Hungarian EA Community and we prepared a Care Package, which you can access&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1NIyVr4EZtcSBHT_NmFnGpLqpJLBEcBRj?usp=sharing\"><u>through this drive link</u></a>.

This makes it especially useful in risk management, when we need to pay particular attention to worst case outcomes. It could be a useful tool for forecasting tail events.</p><p>This document introduces the theorem, describes the limiting probability distribution and provides a couple of examples to illustrate the use (and misuse!) of the Fisher\u2013Tippett\u2013Gnedenko Theorem for forecasting.

Animal Advocacy orgs may have been able to snare the audiences of big groups like Greenpeace and the WWF (3.1M and 3.6M Facebook followers respectively). The other cause areas don\u2019t have such big peers to poach from (Oxfam has 1.1M followers, and Longtermism barely exists beyond EA)</li><li>It seems plausible that&nbsp;<i>Twitter is simply more popular among Effective Altruists</i>. This would explain why the Animal Advocacy movement, within which EAs are a minority, is an exception here (although EAs are also a minority in Global Health &amp; Poverty)</li><li>Some Longtermist and Infrastructure orgs have stopped using Facebook since 2021 and hence can expect to be weaker on the platform (see&nbsp;<i>next subsection</i>)</li><li>Demographics.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sproutsocial.com/insights/new-social-media-demographics/\"><u>Twitter is more male than Facebook</u></a>, and Longtermism is probably more male than than the other cause areas</li></ul><p>I do not take the demographics argument too seriously, however: there is far more variation&nbsp;<i>within</i> cause areas than can be explained by age or gender or random variation.

The data cannot prove the direction of causation, but it probably goes both ways: orgs with a large following have more incentive to harness their audience by posting regularly; orgs that post regularly will attract more followers.

We\u2019re still a bit uncertain, but generally feel positive about the cost-effectiveness and value of organising 1-1s with VP introductory participants&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefppm5g9eu61g\"><sup><a href=\"#fnppm5g9eu61g\">[1]</a></sup></span>. Our results suggest that 1-1s are providing a decent amount of value and are generally highly enjoyed by participants. We\u2019re unsure on the longer term effects of 1-1s on engagement in EA.&nbsp;</p><p>More specifically, here\u2019s our initial research questions and the answers we found:</p><p><strong>Q: How valuable</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1bmsccu0833\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1bmsccu0833\">[2]</a></sup></span><strong>&nbsp;are 1-1s with EA community members for Intro participants or is there any demand for 1-1s?</strong></p><p>A: There is strong demand for 1-1s and it seems like 1-1s are valuable for VP participants. We asked \"how would people feel if they weren't able to do 1-1s\", 21% said they would be very disappointed, which is 19% short from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://review.firstround.com/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit\"><u>40% benchmark</u></a>. Although it's short of the 40% benchmark, on average 1-1s are rated 8.2/10. This makes us feel a little more confident that some 1-1s can be valuable. We anecdotally think they are valuable because it helps expand their network and exposes them to more of the community.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Q: How cost-effective or impactful are 1-1s in the context of EA VP?</strong></p><p>A: We feel somewhat uncertain about the cost-effectiveness of 1-1s, but <strong>we think that 1-1s with VP participants are ~3x as cost efficient as an EAG in leading to connections, but only 1/20 as scalable.&nbsp;</strong><i>Some notes on impact: 1-1s are very hits-based, impact can take a long time and it\u2019s hard to measure counterfactual impact.&nbsp;</i></p><p><strong>Q: What types of 1-1s are most valuable (ex. career focused ones, general EA ones, social, etc)?</strong></p><p>A: We think that both career-focused and general networking 1-1s are valuable. Career ones for helping people be open to changes, meet others and get advice. General 1-1s to expand people\u2019s network and to serve as practice for reaching out to community members.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Q: What type of mentors doing the 1-1s are best suited?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A: We found a broad range of \u2018mentors\u2019 to do 1-1s \u2013 mentors who are very knowledgeable about EA and sociable (such as community builders) rate highly. Cause-area specific mentors (e.g. an experienced grant-maker for someone working in philanthropy, an AI safety researcher for someone working as a software engineer) to talk about specific career paths are extremely valuable as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Q: What \u2018type\u2019 of participant are these most valuable for? E.g. mid-career professionals, those open to changing careers / jobs, students, people near to EA hubs, etc.</strong></p><p>A: We\u2019re very excited about mid-career professionals who are interested in changing careers and jobs. We also think social 1-1\u2019s are valuable for anyone highly interested in EA to help them expand their network. A future research direction is to expand the number of VP participants who are offered a 1-1 \u2013 primarily test participants whose VP application we were less excited about.</p><p><strong>Q: At what stage of the fellowship is it most valuable (beginning, middle, end, after, etc)?</strong></p><p>A: We don\u2019t think 1-1s at the beginning of the fellowship is best. We\u2019re generally uncertain on whether there\u2019s a difference between middle, end, and after. It\u2019s either pretty equal or we need to do more tests.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Q: Are repeated 1-1s, maybe some form of mentorship, more valuable than one-off 1-1s?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A: We didn\u2019t manage to test repeated 1-1s or mentorship. That\u2019s a potential future research direction.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>We have a few main future goals and paths.&nbsp;</strong></p><ol><li>Find ways to streamline the 1-1 process on CEA\u2019s side to make it easier to scale to all of VP&nbsp;</li><li>Run some more specific trials with people interested in making EA-aligned career pivots and interested enough to accelerate their involvement in EA</li><li>Consider running specific 1-1 programmes with In-Depth participants&nbsp;</li><li>Scale up active, targeted outreach to particularly talented individuals already slightly associated with effective altruism to get them to apply to opportunities like EAG&nbsp;</li></ol><h2><strong>Background</strong></h2><p>We (Elika and Jay) ran two pilot 1-1 programs with Virtual Program (VP) Introductory fellowship participants. We wanted to understand if 1-1\u2019s (both general EA ones and career focused ones) with EA community members were valuable at accelerating EA connectedness and taking significant EA-aligned action.</p><p>Our reasons for why this was worth testing in the first place are that 1-1s historically have been used extensively in community building in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://resources.eagroups.org/events-program-ideas/one-on-ones\"><u>groups</u></a>. EA VP is an ongoing and relatively stable way people get introduced to EA. The primary pathway is to find out about EA \u2192 sign up for the Intro fellowship \u2192 finish \u2192 take the in-depth fellowship \u2192 ?[do independent EA work, join EA Anywhere, attend an EAGx or EAG, make EA informed career decisions]?</p><p>However, that\u2019s quite a long timeline from someone interested in EA to making significant life and/or career decisions based on EA. In particular, we had anecdotal data<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1qzsehl7ouj\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1qzsehl7ouj\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;that there were:&nbsp;</p><p>A) promising VP participants who were new-to-EA but had existing career skills that made it highly valuable to&nbsp;<strong>accelerate their introduction into EA</strong></p><p>B) promising VP participants who wanted to take significant EA-informed actions earlier in the pathway (e.g. After the Intro fellowship)<br>We were especially excited about A<strong>&nbsp;</strong>as a source of mid-career talent that could help diversify the community and immediately address talent bottlenecks at EA organisations.&nbsp; Moreover, community building to mid-career professionals generally seemed neglected at this point (less so now with the advent of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eapathfinder.org/\"><u>EA Pathfinder</u></a>). Generally, there\u2019s a large untapped pipeline (almost anyone can engage in EA virtually, only people with in-person groups near them can engage in an in-person group) for \u2018producing new EAs\u2019.</p><p>We also think that while the VP Intro Fellowship curriculum is strongly focused on EA philosophy \u2013 and less on the EA community and integration into the community. This is suboptimal (to some degree) because we believe that engagement and involvement in the EA community (feeling welcomed, connected, etc) is critical to helping people \u2018take the leap\u2019 and practise EA as a life philosophy (make informed career and life decisions). VP currently neglects this. VP also serves as perhaps the most core programme to help EA diversify (especially geographically).&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, the 1-1 programme. You might be asking, why 1-1s? Targeted 1-1 connections are optimal between talented individuals on the periphery of the community (e.g. an EA VP intro fellowship participant) and people who are very involved in the community (working at a major effective altruism organisation) \u2013 in particular because we don\u2019t think most VP intro participants reach out to get connected to other EA\u2019s in a professional or social capacity. This programme helps facilitate that connection.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Methods</strong></h2><p>We ran two time-based cohorts with VP Introductory fellowship participants from September - November. The general method was to identify VP participants on a variety of criteria (our excitement about them, interest in EA, career hingeiness), ask them if they\u2019d like to participate and what type of 1-1 would be most useful, match them with a 1-1 guide (someone in the EA community that we thought they\u2019d be a good fit to talk to), and let them connect. More details on the selection and matching methodology are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/10bchqtAtRY_o7I8R3pZlHNZ7gP13ey3jHcLdqYmBgEM/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>here</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We made a few modifications in our method between the first and second trial \u2013 mainly the guides we had, the demographics of the Intro participants, and the resources we shared with participants.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Results</strong></h2><p>You can view all our data <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GsdLYlbvLouNag6J4LI9ZZqfHaWj64ekseYZzq2UHD0/edit#gid=0\">here</a>.</p><p>Some qualitative feedback from our second round:</p><ul><li>A student considering careers in AIS said they felt really fortunate to have the opportunity to talk to someone who had worked at an AIS organisation they were considering joining.</li><li>A mid-career participant applied to the Charity Entrepreneurship programme because of their guide\u2019s nudge.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>A mid-career participant who was hoping to pivot sharply into a more impactful career said that the 1-1 made them feel like they were already part of the community, despite only having learned about EA recently.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\">&nbsp;</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><strong>Number of Participants asked</strong></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><strong>Number of interest forms filled out</strong></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><strong>Number of participant feedback forms filled out</strong></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><strong>Number of guide feedback forms filled out</strong></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><strong>Average Score on Participant feedback (\"What is your overall satisfaction with the 1-1?\")</strong></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><strong>Average score on guide feedback (\"how do you think the call went?\")</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><strong>MVP Round 1 (testing 1-1's after end of intro fellowship program)</strong></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\">20 total (12 students, 10 professionals)</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\">10</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\">4</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\">3</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\">7.25</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\">8</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><strong>MVP Round 2a (testing 1-1's in middle of intro fellowship program)</strong></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\">29 total (20 professionals, 10 students)</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\">15</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\" rowspan=\"2\">14</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\" rowspan=\"2\">16</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\" rowspan=\"2\">9.08</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\" rowspan=\"2\">8.38</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\"><strong>MVP Round 2b (testing 1-1's at beginning of intro fellowship program)</strong></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\">23 total (18 professionals, 5 students)</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid #cccccc;padding:2pt;vertical-align:bottom\">15</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"http://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/v1672071090/mirroredImages/AJ4ZXWNjcxHL9JEyq/lzsrpdpksubnpqlumc3i.png\"></p><p>We also did a rough BOTEC on cost effectiveness.&nbsp;

The lowest score was a 6/10.&nbsp; The most common positive feedback from the guide side was that they felt like their participant found the 1-1 valuable and that they enjoyed the call.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The programme is a bit high cost to run (in terms of taking up time and resources) \u2013 so much so that it might not be sustainable or scalable. The most time intensive parts were communicating with mentors and participants, selecting participants and matching them to mentors, and then mentors\u2019 own time costs. There are some potential solutions -\u2013 we could invest in setting up some strong automated infrastructure that reduces the organiser\u2019s burden of selecting VP participants, doing 1-1 matching, and communicating with participants. We\u2019d ideally like to see more conclusive data of 1-1s being useful (ideally at improving long-term engagement in EA) before investing in a scaled programme, but generally we\u2019re excited by the initial results.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Discussion</strong></h2><h3><i><strong>How valuable are 1-1s and for whom</strong></i></h3><p>After this project, we now think that one-off conversations are not effective as general on-ramps into effective altruism ideas or the community. We still think they might be useful if the person conducting the call is very clear-thinking and able to usefully direct the conversation to a place of true intellectual exploration, but these skills are rare and so would best be targeted at a particularly talented audience (e.g. if you meet one of the best physics students in the world, and they\u2019re somewhat interested in the space of problems that the effective altruism community cares about, it\u2019s probably worth introducing them to someone especially good at talking about those problems).&nbsp; We sent interest forms only to people who had satisfied criteria such as having completed a certain number of weeks in the Intro fellowship, and there was additional self-selection in the people who ended up filling out the interest form. Therefore, our participants didn\u2019t need much additional encouragement to seriously think about the ideas or want to engage with the community.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><i><strong>1-1s for community</strong></i></h3><p>From our feedback form, it seems like the participants felt a strong sense of community through the calls and the guides felt like a lot of the value they were providing came from prompting the participants towards next steps. This makes us feel hopeful that calls can possibly serve as an effective trigger for participants to get more engaged with the community. Moreover, ~20% of our participants had the skills to start contributing to key cause areas within a few months and explicitly wrote that they were considering career changes related to effective altruism ideas<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefan2gfvjxvju\"><sup><a href=\"#fnan2gfvjxvju\">[4]</a></sup></span>. Therefore, we feel more excited now about projects that involve active, targeted outreach nudging participants to apply to opportunities like EAG or 80k Career Advising.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><i><strong>Is there a formula for matching?&nbsp;</strong></i></h3><p>There was a huge difference in retention rate and feedback quality from our first and second rounds from participants. We had a median and mean score of 7 in the first round. For the second round, we had a median score of 10 and a mean score of 9.&nbsp; It seems like there are certain crucial factors that are essential to get right in order to make programmes like ours that involve getting people to interact with each other in value-producing ways successful enough to gain information value from. These include a relatively high level of professionalism in communication, lots of transparency around motives and setting clear expectations around the calls for both guides and participants, and matching people quickly (within a week of the interest form closing). We also had significantly better matching in the second round since we had amassed more people who could serve as guides, and this made the 1-1\u2019s generally go much better.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Summary: So where does that leave us?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>We still think VP is relatively neglected, undervalued, and there\u2019s lots of low-hanging fruit. 1-1s are potentially valuable \u2013 both from a career and impact perspective and a community connectedness perspective. We think that a VP 1-1 programme is valuable, comparable on the order of an EAG (!!). However, in its current state, the programme is too time-consuming and the data a bit too unclear for it to be scaled up entirely<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefut740zg6p4\"><sup><a href=\"#fnut740zg6p4\">[5]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;</p><p>We\u2019re left with some questions and programme changes to try out with the ultimate hope of having more clarity on who 1-1s are most useful for and what the lowest-cost way to run such a programme is<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbrvfbheex2m\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbrvfbheex2m\">[6]</a></sup></span>. We also want to try some other low-hanging fruit tests entirely different to 1-1s to help direct and squeeze out EA VP\u2019s value<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefaenppyskr9b\"><sup><a href=\"#fnaenppyskr9b\">[7]</a></sup></span>.

In this post I'm sharing some loosely connected thoughts and reflections about the purchase.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Context</strong></p><p>I think it's important to understand the Wytham Abbey purchase in a larger context. In recent years EA has attracted <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cfdnJ3sDbCSkShiSZ/ea-and-the-current-funding-situation\">vastly more funding</a> than before. This likely affected the way decisions were made. It probably led to less due diligence on (some) individual decisions, a greater willingness to spend money on more risky bets and changed trade-offs between money on the one hand and time and convenience on the other hand. The until recently very comfortable funding environment also<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xof7iFB3uh8Kc53bG/why-did-cea-buy-wytham-abbey?commentId=3cLRAk98q8jMwhrEc\"> influenced the decision</a> to buy Wytham Abbey.&nbsp;</p><p>All of this may be good or bad or both at the same time. But it definitely changed EA. People have raised concerns about a perception of lavish spending and potentially <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/nqt3kasPieQEKihCp/the-biggest-risk-of-free-spending-ea-is-not-optics-or\">grift</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/RPTPo8eHTnruoFyRH/some-important-questions-for-the-ea-leadership\">lack of transparency</a> or questionable <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/HWaH8tNdsgEwNZu8B/free-spending-ea-might-be-a-big-problem-for-optics-and\">epistemics and motivated reasoning</a>. Some argued that EA was not living up to its own standards. The EA movement as a whole was criticised in the past for making self-serving trade-offs, arguing that luxury/convenience = productivity. Wytham Abbey seemed to reinforce existing sentiments (If you look at the comments on the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xof7iFB3uh8Kc53bG/why-did-cea-buy-wytham-abbey\">Wytham Abbey discussion post</a> I can see why you could walk away with an impression that some of the commentators engaged in motivated reasoning).&nbsp;</p><p>EA relies on trust and a positive perception both from outside and on the inside to be a healthy community that can operate effectively. Sure, things that look bad can still be good overall. But even leaving aside the obvious point that things often look bad because they actually are bad, decisions that alienate people inside and outside the movement can cause long-lasting damage. There is only a limited time that EA can say \"we know decision XY may look bad on the surface, but we thought a lot about it and think it's the right call and we need you to trust us on this\". Whether or not you agree with the criticism outlined above, it is important to take it into account.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Communicating to the outside</strong></p><p>I feel EVF's communication (or lack thereof) made the Wytham Abbey purchase look unnecessarily bad.&nbsp;</p><p>The first issue is the lack of any formal announcement (even though money for this project <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xof7iFB3uh8Kc53bG/why-did-cea-buy-wytham-abbey?commentId=3cLRAk98q8jMwhrEc\">was committed in November 2021 and the purchase went through in April 2022</a>). I've only heard about this recently through a tweet from <a href=\"https://twitter.com/xriskology/status/1600156432879407106\">\u00c9mile Torres</a>, an article in the <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/08/15/the-reluctant-prophet-of-effective-altruism#:~:text=Last%20year%2C%20the%20Centre%20for%20Effective%20Altruism%20bought%20Wytham%20Abbey%2C%20a%20palatial%20estate%20near%20Oxford%2C%20built%20in%201480.%20Money%2C%20which%20no%20longer%20seemed%20an%20object%2C%20was%20increasingly%20being%20reinvested%20in%20the%20community%20itself\">New Yorker from August 2022</a>, and a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xof7iFB3uh8Kc53bG/why-did-cea-buy-wytham-abbey\">discussion post on the EA Forum</a>. My impression is that \u00c9mile's tweet surprised many EAs and put CEA/EV in a difficult spot where they found themselves having to defend against criticism and attacks. An open and upfront announcement and explanation of the reasoning could have saved them a lot of trouble.&nbsp;</p><p>Grants not being announced immediately is not exceptionally unusual. There often is a certain delay and in addition there seems to be a backlog of old grants that also need to be published. This is understandable. Owen Cotton-Barratt <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xof7iFB3uh8Kc53bG/why-did-cea-buy-wytham-abbey?commentId=u3yJfbm2pes8TFpYX\">adds</a> that they didn't want to create hype and felt a natural time to make the purchase public was when they would be ready to start applications for events. I'm not convinced by that argument and with hindsight knowledge I think it's fair to call this a mistake.&nbsp;</p><p>The second issue is the lack of transparency on the reasoning behind the purchase. I think it's bad that the public cannot see the full picture. In the absence of any further information, people are left with little else than their preconceptions of EA. The question of whether you interpret Whytham Abbey as a sign of lavish spending and motivated reasoning or as a a very reasonable investment largely depends on your view of EA and whether you trust EA/CEA/EVF they made the right call. By not providing context and explanations, CEA/EVF missed an important opportunity to shape the perception of the Wytham Abbey purchase.&nbsp;</p><p>The EA movement itself in the past has created very high standards and expectations of transparency, accountability and efficiency. For years it has been part of the central messaging of EA that it is on average possible to save a life for around $5000. As a consequence, people are now understandably asking why EA bought a lavish mansion rather than funding malaria bed nets. Not addressing these questions seems like a mistake. Wytham Abbey was purchased with money entrusted to EA and in the name of EA and with that comes some obligation to explain why it was used in a certain way.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Reflecting on the inside</strong></p><p>I also feel some aspects of the Wytham Abbey purchase look bad from an inside perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, I'm concerned that the lack of a carefully crafted messaging ultimately seems to imply a lack of awareness that this could have been a sensitive purchase at all. I'm confused why no one seemed to realise that this grant decision might be (or at least <i>feel</i>) different to other grant decisions and that people might care about it or want to know about it. It feels out of touch with the world in a way that is not good.&nbsp;</p><p>Secondly, I'm concerned about transparency as a value in and of itself. So far CEA/EVF hasn't come out explaining their rationale in detail (albeit <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xof7iFB3uh8Kc53bG/why-did-cea-buy-wytham-abbey?commentId=u3yJfbm2pes8TFpYX\">some</a> of those <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xof7iFB3uh8Kc53bG/why-did-cea-buy-wytham-abbey?commentId=3cLRAk98q8jMwhrEc\">involved</a> in the decision have commented under an <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xof7iFB3uh8Kc53bG/why-did-cea-buy-wytham-abbey?commentId=rihLCJsSXL6cotCDv\">EA Forum Post asking about the decision</a> and shared their perspectives). Maybe a more detailed overview of the purchase will be made public eventually. But the fact that this hasn't happened yet more than 9 months after the purchase leaves me with an impression that transparency isn't very high on CEA/EVF's priority list.&nbsp;</p><p>This lack of transparency makes EA open to unnecessary attacks. And also makes necessary scrutiny impossible. If the math checks out, then publishing the calculations could have easily ended long and futile discussions and help respond to criticism from outside and inside. If it does not, then it is important to know and to scrutinise the decision-making process.&nbsp;</p><p>I acknowledge that there are trade-offs surrounding transparency. Not every good decision can be easily explained and not everything has to be public. But in general, EAs should strive to be the kind of people who highly value transparency and openness as intrinsic values. EA should be careful not to cultivate a mindset of \"we know what's right, and transparency will only cost us time\". In the specific instance of the Wytham Abbey purchase, a stricter norm for openness and transparency might have helped avoid many of the issues outlined above surrounding the lack of communication. Transparency is epistemically healthy and fosters trust, dialogue and shared learning. A movement which is grounded in empiricism and praises itself for its good epistemics should not treat transparency as something optional.&nbsp;</p><p>My hope is that we can take Wytham Abbey as an opportunity to discuss and further reflect on the community norms and values. I'm interested in hearing your thoughts.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "nikos"}}]
