I think it will in expectation raise quite a lot of money, significantly increasing our money moved this year.

In these, people who followed our full package of suggestions including emailing large numbers raised thousands, though I don't expect most people to do that. Additional evidence for the prospects of this peer-to-peer approach come from the fact that it is widely used in the charity world, and charities who apply it find it raises significant amounts.</p>\n<p>A large number of groups running this simultaneously should make a bigger splash and potentially get attention in local/student media, which we'd work towards. </p>\n<p>Besides money moved, an additional benefit of this fundraiser will be to spread the word about evidence-based charity. Naturally this would result if we succeeding in getting media coverage. It also happens each time someone emails a friend or family member about the fundraiser - people often don't talk about evidence-based charity with people they know, and a peer-to-peer fundraiser like this provides an excuse for doing so.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "omLQDPjXDQaSbomqL", "user": {"username": "Tom_Ash"}}, {"_id": "dkzneaBkzv4CvmajZ", "postedAt": "2015-01-27T10:02:17.762Z", "postId": "RPJhCLWEizLYXzyGd", "htmlBody": "<p>Have you considered doing something that could go viral like the Ice Bucket Challenge?
