In hindsight, perhaps the right move would have been investing more in AI governance early on, and perhaps seeking to make OpenAI a government body. Though, I expect taking AI risk to DC in 2015 would have been a tough sell.</p>", "parentCommentId": "9wFwaP4fCDePDqsxt", "user": {"username": "Ailanthus"}}]
