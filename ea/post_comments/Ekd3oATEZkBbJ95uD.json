This is because individuals can't choose a whole distribution over career paths, only a single career path. Let's say our best guess at the best areas for people to work in is that there's a 30% chance it's AI, a 20% chance it's biosecurity, a 20% chance it's animal welfare, a 20% chance it's global development, and a 10% chance it's something else. Then that would also be the ideal distribution of careers (ignoring personal fit concerns for the moment). But even if every single person had this estimate, all of them would be optimizing by choosing to work in AI, which is not the optimal distribution. Every person optimizing their social impact actually leads to a suboptimal outcome!</p>\n<p>The main countervailing force is personal fit. People do not just optimize for the expected impact of a career path, they select into the career paths where they think they would be most impactful. Insofar as people's aptitudes are more evenly distributed, this evens out the distribution of career paths that people choose and brings it closer to the uncertainty-adjusted optimal distribution.</p>\n<p>But this is not a guaranteed outcome. It depends on what kind of people EA attracts. If EA attracts primarily people with CS/software aptitudes, then we would see disproportionate selection into AI relative to other areas. So I think another source of irrationality in EA prioritization is the disproportionate attraction of people with some aptitudes rather than others.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "therealslimkt"}}, {"_id": "sXuKXwWq5F9Wpk5x2", "postedAt": "2022-08-23T17:41:22.721Z", "postId": "Ekd3oATEZkBbJ95uD", "htmlBody": "<p>The more time I've put into giving career advice and trying to work out my own career planning, the more I'm drawn to <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bud2ssJLQ33pSemKH/my-current-impressions-on-career-choice-for-longtermists\">Holden's aptitude advice</a>.

To argue that e.g. 80k doesn't have enough uncertainty (even if you have reasons to believe that high uncertainty is warranted in general), it's necessary to argue that their methodology is not only subject to irrationality, it's subject to bias in the direction you argue (overconfidence rather than underconfidence in top causes).</p><p>E.g. if their numbers for I, T, and 1/N are based on point estimates for each number rather than expected values, then you underrate causes that have a small chance to be big / highly tractable.

For example, if the community was homogenous and all assigned a 1% chance to Cause X being the most important issue (I'm deliberately trying not to deal with how to measure this) and there was a 99% chance of cause Y being the most important issue, then all individuals would choose to work on Cause Y.

That being said, they're still using phrases like \"we're very uncertain\". Maybe the lack of uncertainty about some relevant facts is lower than their decision rule. For example, in the <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/artificial-intelligence\">problem profile,</a> they write:</p><blockquote><p>Overall, our current take is that AI development poses a bigger threat to humanity\u2019s long-term flourishing than any other issue we know of.</p></blockquote><p><strong>Different Views under Near-Termism</strong></p><blockquote><p>If you don't buy longtermism, you probably still care about x-risks, but your rejection of longtermism massively affects the <i>relative </i>importance of x-risks compared to nearterm problems, which affects cause prioritisation.</p></blockquote><p>This seems tempting to believe, but I think we should substantiate it. What current x-risks are not ranked higher than non-x-risks (or how much less of a lead do they have) relative to non-x-risks causes from a near-term perspective?&nbsp;</p><p>I think <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/KDjEogAqWNTdddF9g/long-termism-vs-existential-risk#Does_Long_Termism_Ever_Come_Up_With_Different_Conclusions_Than_Thoughtful_Short_Termism_\">this post </a>proposes a somewhat detailed summary of how your views may change under a transformation from long-termist to near-termist. Scott says:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Does Long-Termism Ever Come Up With Different Conclusions Than Thoughtful Short-Termism?</strong></p><p>I think yes, but pretty rarely, in ways that rarely affect real practice.</p></blockquote><p>His arguments here are convincing because I find an AGI event this century likely. If you didn't, then you would disagree. Still, I think that even were AI not to have short timelines, other existential risks like engineered pandemics, super-volcanoes or asteroids might have milder only catastrophic variations, which near-termists would equally prioritise, leading to little practical variation in what people work on.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Talking about different cultures and EA</strong></p><blockquote><p>Similarly, I don't expect diversity of thought to introduce entirely new causes to EA or lead to current causes being entirely abandoned, but I do expect it to affect cause prioritisation.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't entirely understand what East Asian cultures mean by balance / harmony so can't tell <i>how</i> it would affect cause prioritisation, I just think there would be an effect.</p></blockquote><p>Can you reason out how \"there would be an effect\"?&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "jL2eph62Xnykv5GBS", "user": {"username": "Joseph Bloom"}}, {"_id": "aBfgHo49cW5cp8MN7", "postedAt": "2022-09-07T19:53:21.464Z", "postId": "Ekd3oATEZkBbJ95uD", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi, thanks for writing this.
