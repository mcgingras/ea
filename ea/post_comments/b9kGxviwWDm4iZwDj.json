Trusting your numbers, you would save about 200 $ and decrease your travel time by 8 h. I think donating to Founders Pledge's <a href=\"https://founderspledge.com/funds/climate-change-fund\">Climate Change Fund</a> (CCF) removes at least 1 tCO2e/$ (see \"Conservative impact analysis example of innovation in<br>neglected tech\" of <a href=\"https://assets.ctfassets.net/x5sq5djrgbwu/7eEpX4UcKNEy6LUDhf2B05/735518c277987ad5ad91f096b1fdc2a7/A_guide_to_the_changing_landscape_of_high-impact_climate_philanthropy.pdf\">this</a> report), so you could potentially remove 200 tCO2e with the savings. This is much larger than the difference of CO2 you estimated, and so I guess it greatly outweights other environmental impacts too.</p><p>In addition, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/NbWeRmEsBEknNHqZP/longterm-cost-effectiveness-of-founders-pledge-s-climate\">I think</a> there are even more effective options than CCF, e.g. donating to the <a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/far-future\">Long-Term Future Fund</a>.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "vascoamaralgrilo"}}, {"_id": "hhtWaaq6qEWD4z79p", "postedAt": "2022-09-22T20:18:55.521Z", "postId": "b9kGxviwWDm4iZwDj", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks that's my instinct as well, but if anyone wants to dig into the numbers more deeply would be happy for it.</p>", "parentCommentId": "FQjJzsHqEpkawk5uE", "user": {"username": "Ben Yeoh"}}, {"_id": "2TBbL2s5yRBPokR4u", "postedAt": "2022-09-22T23:33:44.538Z", "postId": "b9kGxviwWDm4iZwDj", "htmlBody": "<p>I've recently done a similar journey (London &gt; Belgium &gt; &nbsp;Aachen &gt; ... &gt; Berlin &gt; Paris &gt; Barcelona), staying overnight at a Paris hostel.

Another caveat is that I traveled light, with one backpack and a bag, which greatly simplified things for me.
