I\u2019m happy that people are trying to combine the field of longtermism and animal welfare.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Here\u2019s a few initial thoughts from a non-professional (note I didn't read the full post so I might have missed something):&nbsp;</p><p>I generally believe that moral circle expansion, especially for wild animals and artificial sentience, is one of the best universal ways to help ensure a net positive future. I think that invertebrates or artificial sentience will make up the majority of moral patients in the future. I also suspect this to be good in a number of different future scenarios, since it could lower the chance of s-risks and better the scenario for animals (or artificial sentience) no matter if there will be a lock-in scenario or not.&nbsp;</p><p>I think progression in short-term direct WAW interventions is also very important since I find it hard to believe that many people will care about WAW unless they can see a clear way of changing the status quo (even if current WAW interventions will only have a minimal impact). I also think short-term WAW interventions could help to change the narrative that interfering in nature is inherently bad.&nbsp;<br>(Note: I have personally noticed several people that have similar values as me (in terms of caring greatly about WAW in the far future) only caring little about short-term interventions.)</p><p>It could of course be argued that working directly on reducing the likelihood of certain s-risk and working on AI-alignment might be a more efficient way of ensuring a better future for animals. I certainly think this might be true, however I think these measures are less reliable due to the uncertainty of the future.&nbsp;</p><p>I think Brian Tomasik has written great pieces on why <a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/dont-focus-hedonistic-imperative/\">animal-focused hedonistic imperative</a> and <a href=\"https://reducing-suffering.org/will-gene-drives-reduce-wild-animal-suffering/\">gene drive</a> might be less promising and more unlikely than it seems. I do personally also believe that it\u2019s unlikely to ever happen on a large scale for wild animals. However, I think if it happens and it\u2019s done right (without severely disrupting ecosystems), genetic engineering could be the best way of increasing net well-being in the long term. But I haven't thought that much about this.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Anyways, I wouldn't be surprised if you already have considered all of these arguments.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I\u2019m really looking forward to your follow-up post :) &nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Jens Aslaug"}}, {"_id": "bmxkJLTGSmRcLDfgc", "postedAt": "2023-10-09T09:18:35.713Z", "postId": "ZNcdt7eYWW7YXALvx", "htmlBody": "<p>Hey Jens, thanks a lot for your comment! I agree that moral circle expansion efforts and direct WAW interventions seem like really important elements of a portfolio of actions to bring about a net-positive future.&nbsp;</p><p>In terms of the unreliability of AI-specific animal advocacy actions given the uncertainty of the future: I guess there could be some pretty broad actions that would apply across various areas and scenarios, like lobbying governments to ensure that animal interests are mentioned in any cross-cutting national/international standards and regulations on responsible AI use. The best bet might be a balance of those sorts of actions with more targeted, industry-specific actions (like engaging with regulators to ensure that AI systems used in e.g. intensive chicken farming are sensitive enough to genuinely detect most welfare concerns).&nbsp;</p><p>Thanks for those resources on gene drives, I'll check them out!</p><p>And cheers, watch this space! :-)&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "AREqSA2mZAbkdWxbt", "user": {"username": "max_blakemore"}}, {"_id": "vnHS8vvWEyqbasCXF", "postedAt": "2023-10-09T12:23:27.699Z", "postId": "ZNcdt7eYWW7YXALvx", "htmlBody": "<p>I agree. :) Your idea of lobbying and industry-specific actions might also be more neglected.

I knew about the problems that could arise on large farms, the intensification of production, and the significant harm to animals, but I never thought about self-driving cars that can collide with small animals. This text perfectly summarized my lack of knowledge about AI, and I look forward to another post on this topic.
