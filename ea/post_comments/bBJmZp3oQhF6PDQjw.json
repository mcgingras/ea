And you may like this or you may not like it. But it is also true for people in effective altruism. It's been true for people who are libertarianism. So if you look at early libertarianism, say in the 1970s, it had a very particular logical structure. But the actual descriptive fact of the matter was that a lot of libertarians were nerdy white males and some other set of libertarians were non-nerdy, somewhat rural, kind of gun owning anti-authoritarian, very US American white males who had a particular set of grudges. And what you end up getting from libertarianism is some evolution of those socioeconomic groups, which again, you might like or you might not like. But if you're evaluating libertarianism, you have to think a bit, well, what are the natural constituencies? What will those demographics get you? Do you like all of that? And are you ready for the stupider version of the theory?&nbsp;</p><p>So there's like the Robert Nozick super smart, very sophisticated libertarianism. But of course, that's not what you get. You get the stupider version. So you have to ask with effective altruism, well, what is the stupider version of effective altruism and what are its demographics and what does that mean is its destiny? I have limited experience in the EA movement, but at least in the United States, and I would readily admit other countries may differ. In the United States, it's quite young, very high IQ, very coastal, very educated, but broadly people with the social conscience. None of that should be surprising, right? But I think the demographics of the EA movement are essentially the US Democratic Party. And that's what the EA movement over time will evolve into. If you think the existential risk is this kind of funny, weird thing, it doesn't quite fit. Well, it will be kind of a branch of Democratic Party thinking that makes philanthropy a bit more global, a bit more effective. I wouldn't say it's a stupider version, but it's a less philosophical version that's a lot easier to sell to non-philosophers. Just so you end up telling people you should think more broadly about how you should give money at the margin, I agree with that. I'm fine with it. But it's simply another way of thinking about what effective altruism really is, just as it is with libertarianism, just to understand that demographics is destiny.&nbsp;</p><p>I gave a talk to an EA group lately, and I'm always like a troll when I give these talks. That's on purpose, but I'm saying things I believe, to be clear. I'm not making up stuff I don't believe. So I said to them all, you EAers, you should be more religious, and a lot of you should be social conservatives, because social conservatism is actually better for human welfare. I didn't mean that in the sense of government coercively enforcing social conservatism on people, but just people voluntarily being more socially conservative. I said a lot of you should do a lot more to copy the Mormons. Maybe now I would say the Quakers, other groups too. What was striking to me was how shocked everyone was by this point. I'm not saying they should have agreed or not agreed, but they hadn't ever heard it before. Will McAskill said this in his podcast with me. He said, oh, where are all social liberals? That doesn't really follow at all. It's something you can debate. But the fact that so many people took it for granted to me gets back at this point. When it comes to EA, demographics is destiny, and the future of socially conservative EA is really not that strong, but it should be. And after my talk, a woman went up to me and she came over and she whispered in my ear and she said, you know, Tyler, I actually am a social conservative and an effective altruist, but please don't tell anyone. I thought that was awesome. And of course, I didn't tell anyone who she was. But the mere fact that she felt the need to whisper this to me gets back to demographics is destiny.&nbsp;</p><p>So in part, when you think about EA, don't just think about the philosophic propositions. Think about what it is, what it is becoming. And again, in the United States, at least, it is a very specific set of sociological connections that will shape its future. I like many of those trends at the margin, but I would say not all of them. And just looking at EA that way would be another way in which I differ from a lot of the effective altruists themselves, noting that when I mentioned social conservatism, they just all were shocked. I don't think they agreed with me, but for me, the important point was that they were shocked that I would bring up such a thing. They just took it for granted that effective altruist people ought to be social liberals.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "ModusTrollens"}}, {"_id": "wnjW6DkGMMiMHXfpJ", "postedAt": "2023-02-16T20:29:06.745Z", "postId": "bBJmZp3oQhF6PDQjw", "htmlBody": "<p>Almost every \"bad\" thing said here about \"Woke EA\" sounds good to me, while the \"good\" things EA would otherwise be able to achieve sound absolutely horrible.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Guy Raveh"}}, {"_id": "wjLAhA9KrmmxmbNBp", "postedAt": "2023-02-16T20:47:26.047Z", "postId": "bBJmZp3oQhF6PDQjw", "htmlBody": "<p>Could you expand on this?

Movements uncomfortable with this naturally get swallowed by wokeness.\"</em></p>\n<p>I think it's pretty clear that what Richard Hanania and the post author mean when they say \"anti-woke\" is that they think EA should entertain operationalized racism and sexism.

Strangely, the main answer seems to be: leftists. I talk to a wide range of people in academia about left-wing anger and the fear it sustains. As you\u2019d expect, the people who are most outraged by the climate of fear are non-leftists. But the people who personally experience the most fear are leftists themselves. In my private conversations, some of the most boring milquetoast technocratic leftist scholars have grimly foretold that somehow, someday, a mob of their own ideological persuasion will come for them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n", "parentCommentId": "qksuJgeqmzfB2AryN", "user": {"username": "Aptdell"}}, {"_id": "C7cg3Awa5wBNdKPmY", "postedAt": "2023-02-18T02:17:57.568Z", "postId": "bBJmZp3oQhF6PDQjw", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>Ideas that you talk about don't stand on their own.

He uses crude, sweeping generalizations, deliberately provocative language, and emotionally inflammatory criticisms of wokeness. Brace yourselves for that. He's not using the usual rhetorical style and rationalist epistemics of EA Forum posts. He's writing to get your attention, and you probably won't like at least half of what he says.</p><p>Second, despite all that, I agree with Hanania that wokeness is an existential threat to EA, to utilitarianism, and to rationalism, and we should take the threat more seriously. &nbsp;</p><p>I've noticed a tendency in EA to show exactly the kind of gutless, cringing, defensive deference to woke critiques of EA that Hanania talks about. Whenever a critic of EA (whether inside or outside the movement) uses woke argument styles, deploys woke terms, and invokes woke values (e.g. 'diversity, equity, inclusion'), most EAs seem too frightened to challenge them, for fear of suffering the usual fate of the anti-woke: dogpiling, brigading, ostracism, and cancellation.&nbsp;</p><p>If we don't develop robust defenses against wokeness, we will suffer the same fate as every other organization that values emotional victimization rhetoric over scope-sensitive rationality.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "geoffreymiller"}}, {"_id": "scywMrqopgGXR2CCG", "postedAt": "2023-02-18T23:16:28.101Z", "postId": "bBJmZp3oQhF6PDQjw", "htmlBody": "<p>How can we \u201cfind out using evidence and reason how to do as much good as possible, and to apply that knowledge in practice\" if some avenues to well-being are forbidden?
