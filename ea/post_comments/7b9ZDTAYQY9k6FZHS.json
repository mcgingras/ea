But I think that many of us have heard of them many times before and you are going to see less and less handwringing the more the same stories get posted as proof of worse and worse systemic problems. <strong>For example</strong> I personally was outspoken about the Brent Dill case mentioned above back in 2018, at the time, even though I was new in the community. You could say I was incensed. I even had a meeting with the leader of CFAR at the time (which actually was good of them tbh). Anyway, witnessing that whole thing left a bad taste in my mouth and I definitely kept caring enough that I steered clear of the rationality community (not &nbsp;EA community, they are different!) for years. <strong>But as shocked as I was when that came out (as many were), that doesn't mean I think that it is right to bring that incident up for the rest of time, (if 5 years later is fine, why not 8? Why not 10 years later?), as proof that EA or even the rationality community has a certain problem </strong><i><strong>today</strong></i><strong>.&nbsp;</strong><br><br>Like yes, for sure, there was a problem there. For sure there are problems in little bubbles elsewhere, well I'd bet so anyway, because that's just life right now until society becomes a bit \"better\" about women. But like, the EA community is huge and diverse and many of us who care about this are frankly tired and are starting to not even be sure that we want to feed a narrative that seems to run away with itself into false, generalized directions? Even if we would like to talk about it...? <strong>A lot of us who care are starting to learn that it seems like there isn't a way to talk about this that doesn't lead to people hijacking the conversation to shame all EAs, including those of us who care..? And like, it's totally reasonable if those us who care don't want to play into generalization of ourselves or the movement we care about, a movement which contains our friends whom we also know don't deserve to be generalized in this way?</strong><br><br>In general I think most EAs are totally cool with people making reports etc, I'd certainly encourage it. 100%. I've done so myself multiple times over the 5 years I've been in EA, whenever there was something that happened at an actual EA or rat space. I think it is important that things be brought to attention and logged and tracked somehow, and retributive action be taken if necessary. I just wish in these articles and discussions that there were timestamps and more details attached and such so we knew what we actually had to be worried about? Once you look at the timestamps and other details in relation to the hugeness of the EA community you can't help but notice how much it looks like either cherrypicking OR beating a dead horse and frankly a little sideeyeing of and flatout ignoring journalists (not the women's primary reports themselves though!) is starting to look very, very fair. &nbsp;For EAs who care enough to want details and stuff, there just isn't a lot to say especially if you have heard the vague story before?&nbsp;<br><br>There are plenty of EAs who want any problems handled, but who also aren't going to voluntarily put on a badge of shame. But like, some people, possibly you are one of them, seem to want the whole community to put on a badge of shame? It's like... if people don't see enough handwringing they think EAs as a group don't care about women? But EA is 1/3 women? Anyway, (constant) shows of handwringing (like again and again in response to stories you have already heard) are not actually what you should care about? You should care about hard numbers and detailed incident reports and <i>what is being done</i>? People making their care evident to you and other lurkers is simply not going to be the priority? Like sorry you can't see that many of us in EA give a damn, but I think you must not be looking and it isn't our priority to shove our care in your face at <i>every single turn</i> (sometimes, sure, but not all the time forever) as the most evident thing we do. It is not the lurking self-appointed judges who matter. It is the actual experiences of women etc. You wouldn't expect to see constant updates from any <i>company</i> that is trying really hard to handle gender-related issues, it has other goals too. So like, maybe don't expect constant updates from EA either, and chill out on trying to drag EAs?&nbsp;<br><br>I hope you can take this comment in full stride. On reflection you can likely realize how it appears you'd want to put EAs in a box. It's not fair given how diverse the EA community is and how many of us were already thinking about these problems and were way before the Time piece?

One would have to be scarily good at mental gymnastics to think otherwise, to think that this isn't a bad sign about someone's commitment and orientation to have impact. (It's already suspicious most researchers in EA have worldviews that play to their strengths or make their own work seem particularly important. To some degree, biases in that area are probably unavoidable. Still, at the very least, we can try to select for people who are capable of putting in a half-decent effort to avoid these biases and get it right.)</p>\n<p>Of course, sometimes particular behaviors seem unforgivable to some people but somewhat less bad to others.

But now that I'm seeing the same things repeated in multiple places and used to make misleading points, I no longer think it makes sense to hide info about serial abusers who have been kicked out of the movement, especially when that info is easy to find on other places. <a href=\"https://thingofthings.wordpress.com/2018/10/30/brent-dill-is-an-abuser/\">I prefer the Thing of Things approach</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Summary of my comments + my conclusions:</strong></p><ul><li>There are some allegations of sexual assault or misconduct. Bloomberg mentions five, so those are the ones I discuss, though there are doubtless other accusations out there.</li><li>In at least two cases (assuming Michael Vassar and Brent Dill count), the alleged perpetrators have been officially shunned to the point of being banned from community spaces.</li><li>I would be unsurprised if some of the other cases show up in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/NbkxLDECvdGuB95gW/the-community-health-team-s-work-on-interpersonal-harm-in#Appendix__12_months_of_cases\">this list</a> of stories, some of which end with official bans from EA events or other penalties.</li><li>In cases outside those categories, it isn't clear what anyone could or should have done, aside from socially shunning the alleged perpetrators. It isn't mentioned whether they had jobs at EA orgs, positions of community leadership, etc.</li><li>In some cases, it sounds like friends of the alleged perpetrators were jerks to their accusers. I don't have the full story on any of this, but my best guess is that those friends suck and should consider finding other places to hang out. Ostracizing accusers is common enough that I assume my communities have some people who do this common awful thing.</li><li>The EA and rationality communities have thousands of people in them and have existed for over a decade. Now that there have been two articles focused on us, I'm unconvinced that the actual sum of all these reported incidents points to anything particularly bad, aside from \"humans are gonna human\". I can think of many other communities that seem to be in much worse shape.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>A brief note before we go all TL;DR:</strong></p><p>On the subject of whether alleged perpetrators have been fired or defunded: <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJooJD0Sm2csCYgd0Is6FkpyQa3ket8IIcFzd_FcTRU7avRg/viewform\">CEA</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/albrgr/status/1622997976330440704\">Open Philanthropy</a> both have anonymous forms you can use to report allegations of sexual misconduct.&nbsp;</p><p>As far as I can tell, both orgs take these seriously, though the ambiguous and worrisome <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9JCkkjKMNL4Hmg4qP/ev-uk-board-statement-on-owen-s-resignation\">Owen Cotton-Barratt case</a> left me more confident in Open Philanthropy than CEA.

Lots of people have been updating TOWARD Vassar:</p><blockquote><p>I hereby apologize for the role I played in X's ostracism from the community, which AFAICT was both unjust and harmful to both the community and X. There's more to say here, and I don't yet know how to say it well. But the shortest version is that in the years leading up to my original comment X was criticizing me and many in the rationality and EA communities intensely, and, despite our alleged desire to aspire to rationality, I and I think many others did not like having our political foundations criticized/eroded, nor did I and I think various others like having the story I told myself to keep stably \u201cdoing my work\u201d criticized/eroded. This, despite the fact that attempting to share reasoning and disagreements is in fact a furthering of our alleged goals and our alleged culture. The specific voiced accusations about X were not \u201cbut he keeps criticizing us and hurting our feelings and/or our political support\u201d \u2014 and nevertheless I\u2019m sure this was part of what led to me making the comment I made above (though it was not my conscious reason), and I\u2019m sure it led to some of the rest of the ostracism he experienced as well. This isn\u2019t the whole of the story, but it ought to have been disclosed clearly in the same way that conflicts of interest ought to be disclosed clearly. And, separately but relatedly, it is my current view that it would be all things considered much better to have X around talking to people in these communities, though this will bring friction.</p><p>There\u2019s broader context I don\u2019t know how to discuss well, which I\u2019ll at least discuss poorly:</p><p>Should the aspiring rationality community, or any community, attempt to protect its adult members from misleading reasoning, allegedly manipulative conversational tactics, etc., via cautioning them not to talk to some people? My view at the time of my original (Feb 2019) comment was \u201cyes\u201d. My current view is more or less \u201check no!\u201d; protecting people from allegedly manipulative tactics, or allegedly misleading arguments, is good \u2014 but it should be done via sharing additional info, not via discouraging people from encountering info/conversations. The reason is that more info tends to be broadly helpful (and this is a relatively fool-resistant heuristic even if implemented by people who are deluded in various ways), and trusting who can figure out who ought to restrict their info-intake how seems like a doomed endeavor (and does not degrade gracefully with deludedness/corruption in the leadership). (Watching the CDC on covid helped drive this home for me. Belatedly noticing how much something-like-doublethink I had in my original beliefs about X and related matters also helped drive this home for me.)</p><p>Should some organizations/people within the rationality and EA communities create simplified narratives that allow many people to pull in the same direction, to feel good about each others\u2019 donations to the same organizations, etc.? My view at the time of my original (Feb 2019) comment was \u201cyes\u201d; my current view is \u201cno \u2014 and especially not via implicit or explicit pressures to restrict information-flow.\u201d Reasons for updates same as above.</p><p>It is nevertheless the case that X has had a tendency to e.g. yell rather more than I would like. For an aspiring rationality community\u2019s general \u201cwho is worth ever talking to?\u201d list, this ought to matter much less than the above. Insofar as a given person is trying to create contexts where people reliably don\u2019t yell or something, they\u2019ll want to do whatever they want to do; but insofar as we\u2019re creating a community-wide include/exclude list (as in e.g. this comment on whether to let X speak at SSC meetups), it is my opinion that X ought to be on the \u201cinclude\u201d list.</p><p>Thoughts/comments welcome, and probably helpful for getting to shared accurate pictures about any of what's above.</p></blockquote>", "parentCommentId": "4b8sDpsn4AKuukojX", "user": {"username": "deluks917"}}, {"_id": "BP3jz3NN8AJjrhYGo", "postedAt": "2023-03-08T11:40:56.993Z", "postId": "7b9ZDTAYQY9k6FZHS", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>Her post was strongly downvoted, and she eventually removed it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This claim seems misleading at best</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20221112235135/https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/NacFjEJGoFFWRqsc8/women-and-effective-altruism\">12 Nov</a>: +24 post score</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><a href=\"https://archive.ph/zdgRB\">14 Nov</a>: +61 post score</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Edit: That's not to say I disagree with the central thrust of the article -- I find it plausible, and I wish the community health team was able to handle this problem more effectively.

The base rate of survivors reporting sexual assault to any kind of authority or external watchdog is low. Thus, an assumption that the journalists at Time and Bloomberg identified all, most, or even a sizable fraction of survivors is not warranted on available information.</p>\n<p>We would expect the journalists to significantly underidentify potential cases because:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Some survivors choose to tell no one, only professional supporters like therapists, or only people they can trust to keep the info confidential. Journalists will almost never find these survivors even with tons of resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Some survivors could probably be identified by a more extensive journalistic investigation, but journalism isn't a cash cow anymore. The news org has to balance the value of additional investigation that it internalized against the cost of a deeper investigation. (This also explains why news articles likely have a much higher percentage of publicly-known stories than the true percentage of all stories that are publicly known.)</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>There are also many reasons a survivor known to a journalist may decide not to agree to be a source, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Deciding it is best for their mental well-being not to reopen past trauma by being interviewed about it;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Not wanting the story of what happened to them broadcast in public, even anonymously, and possibly dissected on this Forum among other places;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Feeling that sharing their story would harm EA's object-level work, and deciding not to do so on that basis;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Concern that their anonymity could be unmasked;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Concern that the abuser could recognize them and retaliate, even if the general public can't;</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Other reasons.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Thus, my prediction of the actual scope of a problem vs. how many people have come forward is something vaguely like an S curve.</p>\n<p>An analogous inference from my field of work would be dealing with people caught drunk/drink driving. A very low percentage of episodes come to the authorities' attention. On the first arrest, it's plausible that the driver made a poor isolated choice and has only driven drunk once or a few times. On the second arrest, it's rather unlikely that the problem is isolated but it's plausible that it hasn't happened several dozens of times. On the third arrest . . . absent a reason to think the base rate of detection is way off for this person, there is an extremely high probability the person is drunk/drink driving an awful lot.</p>\n<p>So based on the number of stories journalists found in which survivors were willing to speak to the journalists, what is the true number of stories and perpetrators? I don't have a good estimate, in part because I don't know how many of the stories in the news articles involve the same perpetrators.</p>\n<p>I think good answers could be obtained by professional, independent, neutral researchers . . . but that won't be quick and won't be cheap.

I recommend you make your own conclusions about Jacy by (1) reading pseudonym's comment below this one and (2) visiting Jacy's apology yourself:\n<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8XdAvioKZjAnzbogf/apology\">https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8XdAvioKZjAnzbogf/apology</a> ]</p>\n<p>The rest has been edited:]</p>\n<p>I don't know that much about the case but IIRC Jacy was apologizing for asking some women out on dates, clumsily. He did this online on FB messenger. I think before that apology he [was alleged to have done some inappropriate things] in the animal advocacy community somehow related to him, but had sworn to not do so again (a promise it looks like he probably kept). Anyway, he was apologizing for clumsy online flirting toward people who were not attached to the animal advocacy movement. There were no complaints from  people who had worked for or with him. Jacy's accusers stayed anonymous so he couldn't address the complaints well, but he did apologize and take ownership to the best of his abilities and state that he would take time away to reflect and would be more considerate in future. IIRC he was never (publicly or maybe not at all?) alleged to have done sexual assault or even something most would consider harassment (which legally has a demeaning or disprespectful element, although come to think of it repeated asking out might be harassment) but more clumsy (perhaps overbearing?) flirting that (fairly!) women wanted addressed. It was 3 years after his apology for this repeated behavior that he got funding. The actual behaviors (not the apology) themselves were 3 years or older as well (one was even 7 years before the apology, so 10 years before he got 2022 funding).</p>\n<p>So what do you guys think? Was 3 years long enough to mandate a period of reflection and pause of financial support? Answer via:</p>\n<p><em>agreevote my comment to signal that you think after 3 years (given what he did and that he has had no issue since) (1) that it was okay that he be given funding for a competitive grant application or (2) that it would be okay that he be otherwise employed in animal welfare with EA dollars</em></p>\n<p>Or:</p>\n<p><em>disagreevote my comment to signal that you think he should not get EA funding again, period, or that 3 years later was much too soon for what he did</em></p>\n<p>I'd be very interested if there is any woman who had one of those troubling incidents with Jacy who could chime in and say what she thinks about him getting funding 3 years after his apology.</p>\n<p><em>I acknowledge that perhaps this question is also related to how much funding overhang there is (like I'd not like to see promising young women passed over for funding in favor of him) but back in 2022 I think there was more funding. For now please agreevote this question as though it is just a question of whether he should get funding ever at all, in some world where there is plenty of funding to go around.</em></p>\n<p>[Edit: For posterity, I'll note that this poll was at -7 (5 votes) when I edited it.

The patterns are similar: lack of clear boundaries between work/life, men in positions of power commanding capital, high costs to say anything, lack of feedback mechanisms in reporting. I am thankful that CEA is upping its efforts here; however, I also see that the amorphous nature (especially in the Bay Area) of these subcultures makes things difficult. It seems that most of the toxicity comes from the rationalist community, where there are virtually no mechanisms of feedback.</p><p>I am in touch with some of the women in the article, and they tell me that they feel safe speaking up now that they're no longer associated with these circles and have built separate networks. However, I agree that EA is very heterogeneous and diffuse, so it's important to understand which subnetworks they're talking about. Unfortunately, that trades off between identifiability, and these women may not want to be identified due to having tried to speak up before, then being shut down in a traumatizing manner.</p><p>There is an extremely high cost in <i>some</i> of these subnetworks to naming an accuser. These subnetworks are usually male-dominated, and view any form of speaking up as malicious \"cancellation.\"&nbsp;</p><p>This is also why I find the LW response to be inappropriate. While many of these claims are \"old news\" to those communities, many of these claims are fresh, and the LW community responded with a high level of dismissal. There was some poor reasoning about \"baseline rates\" (i.e. the people in this article are power law anomalies), but this reasoning is flawed because a) sexual assault remains the most underreported crime, so there is likely instead an iceberg effect, and b) women who were harassed/assaulted have left the movement which changes your distribution, and c) women who would enter your movement otherwise now stay away due to whisper networks and bad vibes.</p><p>Finally, I want to note that there is a distinction between EA/LW as official \"movements,\" and the ideology.

Getting something off the ground (going from zero to one) is something very few people are willing, interested, or think of to do. <i>Good </i>entrepreneurs are a scarce breed, or, at least they are when you want more projects and have a funding overhang (we still do for stuff like this). And whenever you narrow it down to any domain, they become even scarcer, and I think if you narrow it down in to a domain that is new (like digital minds research), they become even scarcer than that.<br><br>If there were job listings for founders for ideas which are already exciting to funders, the zero to one problem could be easier solved eg \"Funding has been secured for forming a network of digital mind research collaborators and advisors. Seeking suitable founder, apply here.\" Maybe Jacy and a dozen other people would apply and then we would know just how replaceable he is. But there are not and no one is doing this (this requires its own entrepreneur). Also there are certain implications of this I'd find very disrespectful to the people who had the key idea in the first place.. it's a bit dehumanizing like everyone is just a cog in the machine.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>My view is that whether someone receives funding depends on the kind of work they are doing, as well as the level of risk they present to the community.</p></blockquote><p>I think I'll note that usually grantmakers are going to measure this. And maybe we should trust them to, idk, if they are EA anyway, at least until further details are given. Like I think it's fine to ask for details but not fine to assume that the grantmakers made an egregious or community-harming decision (Now I think I <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/zuqpqqFoue5LyutTv/the-ea-community-does-not-own-its-donors-money\">have to obligate drop this thing</a> although it's a tangent and I realize it complicates things and goes against my above poll intent).&nbsp;<br><br><strong>We still don't know enough: </strong>I agree this is weird. If I were him, given the intense community backlash, I'd have next done a detailed writeup of everything I'd done with clarification of every relevant detail and what was going on in my mind at the time, then said I'd step back and would be receiving voluntary therapy, treatment, and/or social skills coaching until further notice, depending on what the writeup indicated. But expecting a pre-Gen-Z man to even think of doing this is like, a big ask. No insult to such men but society does not exactly set most of us up to think of that kind of solution, let alone pre-zoomer men. Also I think expecting a lot of details when the complainants remained anonymous might be an impossible ask (thought I think he could probably give more). I also wonder if having a norm where people are forced to bare open every embarrassing incident is good for EA morale... If they are akin to embarrassing incidents it would be better if he showed full details to the Community Health Team and they did a summary for potential grantmakers, employers etc of Jacy when requested (actually this has likely already been done, but I doubt that SFF looked at it in the case of the recent grant because they aren't exactly community-related in that way. Would be interesting and worth knowing if they did though and why they'd have decided to move forward anyway <i>if </i>they did). I'll also note that Jacy has already pushed back a lot on the expulsion from Brown for sexual misconduct and his insistence and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8XdAvioKZjAnzbogf/apology?commentId=ELHW3Y4ePbjB8qpXk\">other details </a>give good reason to doubt the school made the right decision. And either way, if he did do something egregious, that was ~10 years ago from now (I think) which puts it outside of the statute of limitations and I think we should take our cue from that societal norm. He was punished (possibly quite overpunished) via expulsion and it is not our job to do so further. I would like to focus on rehabilitation and recent cases. It might be that without names Jacy can never address the cases to onlooker satisfaction, but perhaps proof of rehabilitation and actions taken to learn would help, and I don't really know why he didn't at least come back and talk about that.<br><br><strong>CEA Events:</strong> I'm not sure that CEA would still hold their ban 3 years later, or if they haven't gotten around to lifting it, would be good if they'd comment if it ever seems relevant to know. I also remember [edit: IIRC but it looks like I likely didn't] reading that CEA felt that the Brown incident kind of tipped them to be more concerned, but if you are very unsure what to think about the brown incident, you might not want to decide as CEA did which was a risk-reduction standpoint rather than a serving justice (either clearing someone's name or convicting them) standpoint. <strong>Relatedly</strong> I'll note, attending EA events (a prime place for asking people out) might have a higher bar of entry for Jacy than getting funding. &nbsp;Events are prime places to interface with women (bigger con for Jacy attending) and they are not that important for people settled into doing their direct work already (smaller pro for Jacy attending). Events are helpful, sure, but they aren't going to be <i>key </i>to effectiveness for someone like Jacy. If CEA evaluated the risk as low but still just don't want him at events because there aren't enough pros to take any risks, that's their right and pretty reasonable. But using funding to do important work, granted by a fund which has a high bar for effectiveness is, by definition, just simply \"important\". The pros and cons scale here is going to tip way differently if he is a minimal risk.</p><p><strong>Conjecture on exposure to \"victims\":</strong></p><blockquote><p>whether he should... be in a position where he can be exposed to more victims (recruiting researchers) is less clear to me</p></blockquote><ol><li>It isn't clear he ever did anything toward any woman he worked with?</li><li>Troubling men can do troubling things to women anywhere [so I'm just not so sure this holds as a qualifier]. I note that it might even actually be better to have him in EA where people are primed to call him on things and he knows he is treading on thin ice. I know this sentence will gross people out but I'm just saying that EA women are not worth more than other EA women. Sure I don't want him in the community <i><strong>if there is a notable risk</strong> </i>[edit: and I acknowledge that it isn't EA's job to take him on], but <i><strong>if we could establish that risk is pretty low</strong></i>, then it is seems reasonable to also infer that it would be better for women overall to have him in the community. [All I'm trying to do here is point out that EAs arent necessarily exposing men \"to <i>more </i>victims\" by working with them or funding them. Unless the counterfactual is that they are going to jail, men are going to get other jobs and work with women so it seems illfitting to bring up that he will be exposed to more women as a morally-relevant or ction-relevant point. If he is that much of a risk he should be in jail or under house arrest or something? At the very least he should have a formal charge so when people do a background check on him it comes up? If we have a problem that notable with him we are just <i>passing him on as a missing stair to the rest of the world.</i>]</li><li>I kind of think the terminology \"victims\" might be a bit strong here for recent cases. Maybe \"accusers\" or \"complainants\" is better if speaking from women's perspective, and \"targets\" better if speaking from Jacy's perspective? I say this as a woman that I find the term a bit disrespectful here or something, to both those women and to people who have experienced worse sexual misconduct... I can definitely imagine situations where I report someone doing some stuff like Jacy did, repeatedly asking out or something related to that, which might indeed be harassment. But I would not ever call myself a victim in regards to that sort of thing and I would not presume to call other women victims about it. And I think saying Jacy might \"victimize\" women who come across him, implies that people should expect or be fearful of worse treatment than we have sound (publicized?) reason to expect.&nbsp;</li></ol>", "parentCommentId": "bpJSMwQCXtuBvykFJ", "user": {"username": "Ivy_Mazzola"}}, {"_id": "RbxEQ7JHeB2ot2ke8", "postedAt": "2023-03-09T19:04:04.689Z", "postId": "7b9ZDTAYQY9k6FZHS", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>Also there are certain implications of this I'd find very disrespectful to the people who had the key idea in the first place.</p></blockquote><p>Sorry, are you referring to Jacy here? what key idea did he come up with?</p><blockquote><p>He was punished (possibly quite overpunished) via expulsion and it is not our job to do so further.</p></blockquote><p>Agree that it is not CEA's job to punish Jacy for his actions at Brown, but this was largely not <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8XdAvioKZjAnzbogf/apology?commentId=vGHdav2i6kv2LH95G\">what happened</a>.</p><blockquote><p>perhaps proof of rehabilitation and actions taken to learn would help, and I don't really know why he didn't at least come back and talk about that.</p></blockquote><p>I agree, and lack of this after 3 years should be a reason to update against its existence or the extent Jacy actually cares about this.</p><blockquote><p><strong>Conjecture on exposure to \"victims\"</strong></p><ol><li>It isn't clear he ever did anything toward any woman he worked with?</li></ol></blockquote><p>One quick question-do you think if sexual harassment allegations are true, is the EA community more or less at risk if Jacy is an independent researcher with no interaction to other EA researchers, or if he's actively trying to form a research network, or if he takes a community building role?</p><blockquote><p>Troubling men can do troubling things to women anywhere.

But trying to begin some discussion which might be relevant to determining if there is a punishment-over-rehabilitation framework in this community and where that line should be drawn. I can't say anything about Jacy's case in particular, and I also don't claim that CEA made a mistake about him or operated under any problematic framework when making their decision about him. To me it does feel really weird though, that if it was so bad, that CEA didn't make it more public so we could all better trust to steer clear or something. That does seem like it would become a missing stair concern, which actually maybe is what happened with him getting funding, idk. Anyway something bad does seem to be going on here (like maybe an overzealous reaction years later, or, I'm thinking more likely after this and another conversation, a non-transparent-enough culture which might lead to missing stairs. In fact either could be present in EA culture even if not in Jacy's case).

Whereas you think 50k to Jacy is reasonable and 200k to Michael as a grantor is reasonable because it's sufficiently small that this effect doesn't matter? I basically don't follow, and I'd be interested in hearing more about your reasoning, if you're happy to clarify!</p></blockquote><p>I mean, I don't think it makes sense to force everyone even vaguely nearby in the EA social network to defer to some EA consensus about who it is OK to engage with vs. not. I think it's important that people can somehow signal \"I don't want my actions to be taken as an endorsement of the EA community, please don't try to interpret my actions as trying very hard to reflect the EA consensus \". The SFF has tried to do this in a lot of its writing and communications, and I think it's pretty important for people to be able to do that somehow.&nbsp;</p><p>I also think it's really important for grantmakers to somehow communicate that a grant from them is not a broad endorsement of all aspects of a project. This is actually frequently a huge obstacle to good grantmaking and there are all kinds of grants that things like the LTFF and OpenPhil and other grantmakers are averse to making because the grant would somehow inextricably come an endorsement of the whole organization or all individuals involved, and this prevents many good grants from happening.&nbsp;</p><p>Historically I have tried to fix this on the LTFF by just publishing my hesitations and concerns with individuals and organizations when I recommended them a grant, but that is a lot of work. It also stresses a lot of people out and gets you a lot of pushback, so I don't think this is currently a solution that people can just adopt tomorrow (though I would love for more people to do this).</p><p>I do also think that $50k is really not very much, and also the grant isn't \"to Jacy\", but to an organization that Jacy is involved in, which I think reduces potential harm by another factor of 2-3 or so. I personally quite disliked this grant, and think it's a bad grant, but I don't think it's a grant that I feel actually causes much harm. It just seems like a bad use of money that maybe causes a few thousand expected dollars in negative externalities.&nbsp;</p><p>There are grants that I would have paid serious money to prevent (like some historical grants to Leverage Research), but this is not one of them, and I think I would update a bit downwards on the judgement of a process that produces grants like this, but not much more.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, I think the $200k speculation grant budget to Michael is actually a good idea, though definitely a high-variance choice and I could totally be convinced it's a bad idea. $200k as a regrantor is just really not very much (I think substantially less power than $50k of direct funding, for example), and as far as I can tell the grants he recommended were extremely unlikely to cause any problems in terms of weird power dynamics or pressure (I don't feel comfortable going into details since speculation grant info is private, but I do think I can share my overall assessment as these grants having been very unlikely to give rise to any undue pressure).</p><p>I do think this is a reasonable thing to worry about. I also think Michael is exactly the kind of person who has in the past suggested projects and perspectives that have been extremely valuable to me, and I think giving him some money to highlight more of those is totally a worthwhile investment. If I was doing something like giving him a speculation grant budget, I do think I would probably take some kind of precaution and block some grants that look maybe like they would involve weird power-dynamics, but it doesn't look like it ever came to this, so it's hard for me to tell what process might have been in place.</p><p>I also separately just want to iterate my own personal epistemic state, which is that I haven't heard of any credible allegations of sexual abuse for Michael. I personally find being around him quite stressful, I know many people who have had bad experiences with him, and he seems very manipulative in a ton of different ways, but I do want to distinguish this from the specific ground truth of sexual abuse and assault. As I said before, I don't currently want him to be part of my community or the Effective Altruism community more broadly.</p><p>I might totally be missing something, and if Michael was more closely involved in the community and would pose more of a direct risk, I would probably spend the (very considerable) effort investigating this in more detail, and I would currently be happy for someone else to investigate this in more detail and share as much as they can, but I also don't currently have the personal capacity with all my other responsibilities to investigate this much further (and my guess is the community health team also thinks there is no immediate urgent need given that he is really not very involved in community things these days).&nbsp;</p><p>I do want to avoid contributing to an information cascade that somehow updates on there being tons of confirmed evidence of sexual assault for someone, when at least I haven't seen that evidence. The only evidence I know of are these two <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RuffleJax/status/1009632877578018816\">tweet</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RuffleJax/status/1009632877578018816\">threads</a> by a person named Jax (who I don't know), and in that tweet thread they also say a bunch of stuff that seems really extremely likely to be false to me, or extremely likely to lack a ton of relevant crucial context, so that I don't consider those allegations to be sufficient for me to update me very much.</p><p>Again, there is totally a chance I am missing information here, and I have my own evidence (unrelated to any sexual abuse or assault stuff) that makes me not want Michael be involved in the EA and Rationality community more than he currently is, and if other people have additional evidence I would love to see it, since this does seem at least somewhat important.</p>", "parentCommentId": "28fSqpiWGyJf5gm8o", "user": {"username": "Habryka"}}, {"_id": "nz8AhwgXsytjKdtdt", "postedAt": "2023-03-11T11:20:15.325Z", "postId": "7b9ZDTAYQY9k6FZHS", "htmlBody": "<p>I think it's good to both address sexual misconduct and to correct misleading context in media pieces.

Or, I wonder where you draw the line at defining \"sexual abuse\"? You yourself appear to admit he is troubling, and when in a relationship that can so easily just become sexual abuse, sexual gaslighting, sexually demeaning statements, etc. It's not like \"sexual behavior\" is a protected category. It's just another type of behavior. Sure it's a very special type of behavior that is attached very strongly to the buttons for dopamine, power, self esteem, and pleasure, but that doesn't make it special for an abusive personality type of person such that they would necessarily put a gate up in their minds around it... it makes it more likely they press that button. Especially once in relationship, it's important to remember sexual misconduct is not rare, for some portion of people (and it sounds like vassar is highly likely to be one of these), who suck at relating to others (like suck so hard it becomes abuse), sexual conduct is just another way to relate, and that poor (<i>abusively</i> poor) sexual relating can be very common for such people.&nbsp;<br><br>Whether or not their relationship was even 2-way toxic, it doesn't excuse sexual abuse so I am not sure I can think of a lot of context that makes up for it.<br><br>But anyway I agree with you that he shouldn't be in community anyway. It;s weird that for so many people sexual abuse would be the breaking point they want absolutely confirmed or denied, when actually there are a lot worse things someone can do before that. I do kinda wonder if people near him should run an intervention though, that unless he seek help for anger issues and other personality issues (did you know there are meds to reduce angry outburts? plus of course other treatments you prob know about, CBT, DBT, etc) and make detialed apologies and accountings of his wrngdoings and accusations til that point, they will cut ties. Like, that would be the agentic option if friends with someone like that. I don't get it. He is probably financially privileged so why can't he use his money to try to fix his issues? Red flag he isn't, or if he has he needs to do a public update to that effect, and what issues he is still struggling with (broken brain is real and maybe permanent but like it's better to admit than people think you don't care to try). Given his prominence in these discussions it is just insane that he has not done something like that.

It appears in one case (not necessarily Jacy's but I've seen this happen myself elsewhere, so I'd actually bet more likely than not that if it was allowed to happen one time it happened in Jacy's case too) that the students had banded together and written letters of unsubstantiated rumors to the Brown committee (eg, assuming what they'd heard in the gossip mill to be true &nbsp;and then trying to make sure the committee \"knew\" the unsubstantiated rumors, perhaps stating them as fact not even relaying how they had heard it), and then the Brown committee actually did use the letters as evidence in the University tribunal. The actual US court said that Brown, in doing this, &nbsp;went against due process. To reiterate, that was another Brown case not Jacy's, but I'd like to hear what actually happened in Jacy's<i> </i>case <i>if</i> we were to count an offense from 10 years ago (which I now think CEA also mostly did not).&nbsp;<br><br>I'm really <i>not</i> trying to defend Jacy here. Actually after reading more and someone even DMed to have a conversation, <i>I do expect he did worse than mentioned in his apology but that any victim won't go public so those of us on the outside will never know for sure. </i>But I'd also like to exhibit why I didn't much discuss the college expulsion, and I still won't jump the gun that, whatever he did, it necessarily deserved expulsion because it looks like Brown at that time may have been both incredibly bad at handling such cases and incredibly rife with rumor mill.&nbsp;</p><p>Plus it was still 10 years ago, and as I said elsewhere he has been punished (possibly overpunished) for that. I know that punishment might not assuage concerns of safety (I've been repeatedly surprised that questions of rehabilitation and self improvement have been so missing from the discussion of him, like no one seems to care that <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/WebLP36BYDbMAKoa5/the-future-might-not-be-so-great?commentId=7tY33jYJQN9qLiTLp\">he also sent apologies directly to the women</a> and also no one has wondered if there is a way he <i>could </i>make it up to the community via self-improvement efforts, although I don't <i>think </i>he has focused on this), but to me <i>safety is the important thing</i>. I guess I'm still unsure what safety level to put Jacy at in my mind <i>today even if I'm becoming more sure he did some troubling things left out of his apology in his past</i>.&nbsp;<br><br>In pushing back on bringing up the college thing, I see myself not as defending Jacy, but as pushing back on an instinct to trust decisions of others, which might lead us into unwarranted disgust reactions and type-casting, which, to me, gets in the way of figuring out <i>what matters about his presence</i>, which, to me, is how <i>safe </i>he is to have around <i>today</i> (10 years after the expulsion).<br><br>I know that some people don't find his work the most worth doing/granting to, but some people do, and if it <i>is </i>worth doing, his actual safety would be worth figuring out and making transparent.&nbsp;<br><br>(That said, as I <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7b9ZDTAYQY9k6FZHS/abuse-in-lesswrong-and-rationalist-communities-in-bloomberg?commentId=EtwGswrScazBvf8qD\">conclude here</a>, I'm now more interested in what is going on upstream, as to why this is so hard to figure out)<br><br>[Additional Reflection: I wish potential granters or collaborators of Jacy would speak to the women (maybe CEA would put them in contact?), and see what they think. While I don't think their perspectives should be \"the be all end all\", I find myself really wishing I could defer to their thoughts today about concrete actions like grantmaking given the passage of time. There are cases in my own life regarding men who I've had complaints about, where I would continue to have concerns about safety and I'd want others to act as though he is still a risk (forever or for some very long amount of time). But there are also other cases, from my own experience as a victim, where <i>depending on the person's evident growth,</i> I might say, \"I think it's been long enough and it's probably okay now\".&nbsp;<br><br>If I were a potential collaborator with Jacy I'd personally be very reluctant to assume that victims and people in the know feel the former <i>or</i> the latter, which in my case would mean I'd dig deeper<i> </i>with the EA Community Health Team. I'd also feel frustrated and concerned if I couldn't find out more, and probably not grant but feel there was some informational injustice occurring. I hope that CEAs processes allow for <i>thorough</i> understanding by well-meaning parties who need the info, and even potential requests to be put in contact with the victims respectfully. If SFF did not go looking for opportunities to thoroughly check things, I do find that troubling/risky/bad of SFF.&nbsp;<br><br>But if systems are not in place for that, I'm not sure we can expect potential collaborative actors such as SFF to just trust nontransparent decisions for the rest of time. It will depend on the case as to exactly <i>how long</i>, but after <i>some</i> amount of time <i>without more complaints</i> we should expect the scales for actors who would otherwise collaborate with past-accused to sort of tip against trusting the old nontransparent decision. They will at some point put much higher probability that it is not relevant to decisions they are faced with today. There will also, simultaneously, begin a period of time where people who view the old decision with different credences get upset at those whose scales tipped toward disregarding the old decision sooner than their own scales lead them too. This means there will be division and some predictable social unrest, until enough time has passed that basically everyone is ready to make peace with/disregard the nontransparent case (which may take 50 years idk). This is a bug of the world which will occur within communities of good people, because communities of good people still put different credences on things. It is not fully- mitigated by people trying to be \"better\" so it has to be fixed on a system level.<br><br>Since I started this topic of checking in about Jacy, I'm becoming more sure that Jacy did some serious things, but I'm also becoming less sure we can judge actors like SFF for attempting to collaborate anyway <i>in cases of non-transparency</i>. Jeff K just <a href=\"https://www.jefftk.com/p/decentralized-exclusion\">wrote a good and short piece about this</a> a couple days ago. I see 4 <i>possible</i> cases here:</p><ol><li>\"The Community Health Team does not have adequate systems for potential collaborators to doublecheck if actors like Jacy are okay to collaborate with today.\"&nbsp;<ol><li>If this is true it implies that systems should be put in place around crosschecking, because with time we should expect people's will to keep ostracizing to degrade, and this might otherwise mean too-soon reintroduction of the accused.&nbsp;</li><li>IMO this should include asking victims, at time of reporting, if people who might need the info can contact them and noting this.</li><li>I think it would also include ethically informing victims that without coming forward publically OR offering corroboration in private, that after some time has passed their claims may be discounted, not fully-discounted, despite the CH team's best efforts. I would want to be informed of this \"bug of social reality\" when reporting so I can be informed going in of what might happen and make the decision I think is best.</li></ol></li><li>\"The CH Team does have systems for ensuring those who need to crosscheck info and plans can do so, <i>but</i> this isn't well-enough-known, such that SFF didn't use it because they didn't realize they could.\"&nbsp;<ol><li>This would imply more publication of this option is needed</li><li>This should include mandating that \"crosschecking is an option for potential collaborators in need\" be attached to any public apology made after a CH Team investigation, like Jacy's apology.</li></ol></li><li>\"The CH Team does have adequate systems for ensuring those who need to crosscheck info and plans can do so, and SFF knew they could use CH Team systems for doublechecking Jacy's safety, but SFF didn't use it because [they didn't think it was worth it or want to or something like that.]\"<ol><li>This would reflect very badly on SFF management and they should be reprimanded and coached to do better, at a minimum (even if SFF is not technically EA if they are making decisions that put EAs at risk, PR-wise and safety-wise, we should try to prompt them to do better).</li></ol></li><li>\"The CH Team does have adequate systems for ensuring those who need the info and plans can do so, and SFF did so and determined that Jacy was safe to work with\"<ol><li>If this is the case, I would want to see it noted in SFF's grant report and a few details.</li></ol></li></ol><p>I'm pretty sure multiple of these possibilities can be ruled out by the people in the know, or even random people who do a little digging, but I'm burned out on it for now.</p>", "parentCommentId": "62qwgKjjXH35QGZpJ", "user": {"username": "Ivy_Mazzola"}}, {"_id": "S7eKGJdsNvG28FKHK", "postedAt": "2023-03-16T18:43:49.644Z", "postId": "7b9ZDTAYQY9k6FZHS", "htmlBody": "<p>I needed to walk away from this thread due to some unrelated stressful drama at work, which seems to have resolved earlier this week. So I took today off to recover from it. :) I wanted to return to this in part to point out what I think are some potential cruxes, since I expect some of the same cruxes will continue to come up in further discussions of these topics down the road.</p><p>1. I think we may have different assumptions or beliefs about the credibility of internal data-gathering versus independent data-gathering. &nbsp;Although the review into handling of the Owen situation is being handled by an outside firm, I don't believe the broader inquiry you linked is.</p><p>I generally don't update significantly on internal reporting by an organization which has an incentive to paint a rosy picture of things. That isn't anti-CEA animus; I feel the same way about religious groups, professional sports leagues, and any number of other organizations/movements.</p><p>In contrast, an outside professional firm would bring much more credibility to assessing the situation. If you want to get as close as ground truth as possible, you don't want someone with an incentive to sell more newspapers or someone hostile to EA -- but you also don't want those researching and writing the report to be <i>favorably </i>inclined to EA either. If the truth is the goal, those involved shouldn't be even unconsciously influenced by the potential effect of the report on EA. This counts for double after the situation with Owen wasn't managed well.</p><p>Conditional on the news articles being inaccurate and/or overstated, an internal review is a much weaker shield with which to defend EA against misrepresentations in the public sphere because the public has to decide how much to trust inside researchers/writers. An outside firm also allows people to come forward who do not want to reveal their identities to any EA organization, and brings specialized expertise in data collection on sensitive topics that is unlikely to be available in-house.</p><p>As I see it, the standard practice in situations like this is to bring in a professional, independent, and neutral third party to figure out what is going on. For example, when there were allegations of sexual misconduct in the Antarctic research community, the responsible agencies brought in an independent firm to conduct surveys, do interviews, and the like. The report is <a href=\"https://www.nsf.gov/geo/opp/documents/USAP%20SAHPR%20Report.pdf\">here.</a></p><p>Likewise, one of the churches in the group of 15-20 churches I attend discovered a sexual predator in its midst. Everyone who attended any of the 15-20 churches was given the contact information for an independent investigative firm and urged to share any information or concerns about other possible misconduct anywhere in the group. The investigative firm promised that no personally-identifiable information would be released to the church group without the reporter's permission (although declining permission would sharply limit the action the church could take against any wrongdoer). The group committed, in advance, to releasing the independent investigative report with redactions only to protect the identities of survivors and witnesses. &nbsp;Those steps built credibility with me that the group of churches was taking this seriously and that the public report would be a full and accurate reflection on what the investigators found.</p><p>2. Based on crux 1, I suspect people may be trying to answer different questions based on this article. If one expects to significantly update on the CEA data gathering, a main question is whether there is enough information to warrant taking significant actions <i>now</i> on incomplete information rather than waiting for information to assist in making a more accurate decision. If one doesn't expect to significantly update on that data gathering, a main question is whether there is enough information to warrant pursuing independent information gathering. The quantum of evidence needed seems significantly higher for the first question than the second. (Either formulation is consistent with taking actions now that should be in undertaken no matter what additional data comes in, or actions where the EV is much greater than the costs.)</p>", "parentCommentId": "5bsyWyCfFgc3cE5LC", "user": {"username": "Jason"}}, {"_id": "YnPmjiBGwy2W8QknY", "postedAt": "2023-03-16T21:42:28.665Z", "postId": "7b9ZDTAYQY9k6FZHS", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for coming back. Hm in my mind, yes if all you are doing is handling immediate reports due to an acute issue (like the acute issue at your church), then yes a non-EA contractor makes sense. However if you want things like ongoing data collection and incident collection for ~the rest of time, it does have to be actually collected within or near to the company/CEA, enough that they and the surveyor can work together. <s>Why would you</s> It seems bad [and risky] to keep the other company on payroll forever and never actually be the owner of the data about your own community?&nbsp;<br><br>Additionally I don't trust non-EAs to build a survey that really gives survey respondents the proper choices to select. I think data-collection infrastucture such as a survey should be designed by someone who understands the \"shape\" and \"many facets\" of the EA community very well so as to not miss things. Because it is quite the varied community. In my mind, you need optional questions about work settings, social setting, conference settings, courses, workshops, and more. And each of these requires an understanding of what can go wrong in that particular setting, and you will want to also include correlations you are looking for throughout that people can select. So I actually think, ironically, that data-collecting infrastructure and analysis by <i>non</i>-EAs will have more gaps and therefore bias (unintended or intended) than when designed by EA data analysts and survey experts.&nbsp;<br><br>That brings me to the middle option (somewhere between CEA and non-EA contract), which is what I understand CEA's CH Team to be doing based on talks/emails with Catherine: commissioning independent data collection and analysis from Rethink Priorities. RP has a skilled/educated professional survey arm. It is <i>not </i>part of Effective Ventures (CEA's parent organisation), so it is still an external investigation and bias should be minimized. If I understand correctly,<s> CEA/CH team will give over their current data to RP</s> [whoops nvm see Chatherine's comment below], and RP will build and promote a survey (and possibly other infrastructure for data-collection), and finally do their own all-encompassing data analysis without CH Team involved, [possibly but not decided yet]. That's my rough understanding as of conversation last month anyway.<br><br>I do find the question of how data will be handled to be a bit tangential to this post, and I encourage people to comment <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/mEkRrDweNSdNdrmvx/plans-for-investigating-and-improving-the-experience-of\">there</a> if concerned. Though I'd actually just caution patience instead. This is a very important problem to the Community Health Team, and I hope this separation (CHT/RP) is enough for people. Personally, the only bias I'd expect Rethink Priorities [and the CH Team] to have would be to work extra hard because they'd <i>care a lot about solving the problem as best they can</i>. EAs know that as best you can requires naked, unwarped truth, as close as you can get, so I don't expect RP to be biased against finding truth at all.<br><br>Now I find myself considering, \"Well, what if RP isn't separate enough for people, and they want a non-EA investigator, <i>despite</i> risk that non-EAs won't understand the culture well enough for investigating cultural problems?\".... And idk, maybe people will feel that way. But then I feel incredible concern and confusion: I would honestly wonder if there is any hope of building resilient trust between EAs and EA institutions at all. If some EA readers don't trust <i>other</i> skilled EAs to try really hard (and competently) to find the truth and good solutions in our own community, idk what to say. It's hard to imagine myself staying in EA if I thought that way. Hopefully no readers here do think that, hopefully readers think RP separation is enough, as I do, but idk, just making my thoughts known.</p>", "parentCommentId": "S7eKGJdsNvG28FKHK", "user": {"username": "Ivy_Mazzola"}}, {"_id": "vjn8GKkeYMbWjktQ4", "postedAt": "2023-03-17T16:45:04.608Z", "postId": "7b9ZDTAYQY9k6FZHS", "htmlBody": "<p>I realized I missed the bit where you talk about how we might not need such intense data to respond now.

I didn't change that particular wording because I wrote the original on mobile (which I deeply regretted and am now incredibly averse to) so I didn't have fancy strikethrough edit features, even when I tried on PC (I didn't realize it worked like that). Without strikethrough ability, I thought it would be epistemically dishonest to just edit that sentence. Instead I promptly, right after that sentence, <i>told people to make their conclusions elsewhere</i> in a way that I feel clearly tells readers to take that part with a grain of salt. All in all I edited that comment ~5 times. I don't have the spoons to re-edit again given I think it's fine.&nbsp;<br><br>More importantly, the <i>transparency of info</i> is obviously a problem if someone like me who usually tries to be pretty airtight on EA Forum things had to edit so much going back and forth from \"here's a thing\" to \"maybe he did worse\" to \"maybe he did less\" to \"maybe he did worse\" again. That's not okay. And now I feel like I'm getting punished for trying to do what no other outsider of the case was willing to try to do (that I saw)... figure out the ground truth [and what it means for EA behavior] <i>publicly</i>.</p><p>Honestly trying to figure out what happened regarding Jacy was a heckin nightmare with people coming out of left field about it after each correction I tried to make, including over DM (again not publicly), and giving multiple comments to comb through on multiple other posts and with their own attached threads.

I was trying to do a public service and it was a huge waste of time with little to glean for certain. [And some of the more interesting bits are not public and I feel very, very weird about that, even saying that I now know of (know <strong>of</strong>, not know for certain) stuff others don't and can't find out about (I can't even doublecheck myself).]&nbsp;</p><p>Was that always the expected outcome just lurking underneath the surface? If so then why would people judge SFF? I'm no longer surprised SFF just granted tbh. They saved themselves the time I wasted.

But I hear the broader concern, and note that some sort of internal-external hybrid is possible. The minimal level of outside involvement, to me, would involve serving as a data guardian, data pre-processor, and auditor-of-sorts. This is related to the two reasons I think outside involvement is important: external credibility, and respondent assurance.</p><p>As far as external validity, I think media reports like this have the capacity to do significant harm to EA's objectives. Longtermist EA remains, on the whole, more talent-constrained and influence-constrained than funding-constrained. The adverse effect on talent joining EA could be considerable. Social influence is underrated; for example, technically solving AI safety might not actually accomplish much without the ability to socially pressure corporations to adopt effective (but profit-reducing) safety methods or convince governments to compel them to do so.</p><p>When the next article comes out down the road, here's what I think EA would be best served by being able to say if possible:</p><p><i>(A) According to a study overseen by a respected independent investigator, the EA community's rate of sexual misconduct is at most no greater than the base rate.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>(B) We have best-in-class systems in place for preventing sexual misconduct and supporting survivors, designed in connection with outside experts. We recognize that sexual misconduct does occur, and we have robust systems for responding to reports and taking the steps we can to protect the community. There is independent oversight over the response system.</i></p><p><i>(C) Unfortunately, there isn't that much we can do about problematic individuals who run in EA-adjacent circles but are unaffiliated with institutional EA.</i></p><p>(A) isn't externally credible without some independent organization vouching for the analysis in some fashion. In my view, (B) requires at some degree of external oversight to be externally credible after the Owen situation, but that's another story. Interestingly, I think a lot of the potential responses are appropriate <i>either </i>as defensive measures under the \"this is overblown reporting by hostile media outlets\" hypothesis or \"there is a significant problem here\" hypothesis. &nbsp;I'd like to see at least funding and policy commitments on some of those initatives in the near term, which would reduce the time pressure on other initiatives for which there is a good chance that further datagathering would substantially change the desirability, scope, layout, etc.</p><p>I think one has to balance the goal of external credibility against other goals. But moving the research to (say) RP as opposed to CEA wouldn't move the external-credibility needle in any appreciable fashion.</p><p>The other element here is respondent assurance. Some respondents, especially those no longer associated with EA, may be more comfortable giving responses if the initial data collection itself and any necessary de-identification is done by an outside organization. (It's plausible to me that the combination of responses in a raw survey response could be uniquely identifying.)&nbsp;</p><p>Ideally, you would want to maximize the number of survivors who would be willing to confidentally name the person who committed misconduct. This would allow the outside organization to do a few things that would address methodological concerns in the Time article. First, it could identify perpetrators who had committed misconduct against multiple survivors, avoiding the incorrect impression that perpetrators were more numerous than they were. Second, it could use pre-defined criteria to determine if the perpetrator was actually an EA, again addressing one of the issues with the Time article. Otherwise, you end up with a numerator covering all instances in which someone reports misconduct by someone they identified as an EA . . . but use narrower criteria to develop the denominator, leading to an inflated figure. It would likely be legally safer for CEA to turn over its event-ban list to the outside organization under an NDA for very limited purposes than it would be to turn it over to RP. &nbsp;That would help another criticism of the Time article, that it failed to address CEA's response to various incidents.</p><p>Contingent on budget and maybe early datagathering, I would consider polling men too about things like attitudes associated with rape culture. Surveying or focusing-grouping people about deviant beliefs and behaviors (I'm using \"deviant\" here as sociologists do), not to mention their own harassment or misconduct, is extremely challenging to start with. You need an independent investigator with ironclad promises of confidentiality to have a chance at that kind of research. But then again, it's been almost 20 years since my somewhat limited graduate training in social science research methods, so I could be wrong on this.</p>", "parentCommentId": "YnPmjiBGwy2W8QknY", "user": {"username": "Jason"}}, {"_id": "ftogorYua6RJBTQGN", "postedAt": "2023-03-21T01:16:35.973Z", "postId": "7b9ZDTAYQY9k6FZHS", "htmlBody": "<p>I'm sorry. it sounds like you've taken a lot of flak for that comment, and having had that same experience I know it's miserable. &nbsp;FWIW I was never responding to or criticizing your comment, only Ariel's.
