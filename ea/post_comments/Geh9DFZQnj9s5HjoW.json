It seems like on the EA forum one of those is to use more factual, descriptive, neutral titles. But elsewhere, the norm is to be attention getting, provocative, etc. &nbsp;You could fairly call this 'clickbait' if you'd like. Clickbait exists because it <i>works</i>. &nbsp;It is startlingly effective, and not just at cheap engagement that dies quickly. &nbsp;It's effective at prompting deep engagement as well. &nbsp;One quick example - video essayists on youtube who do incredibly informative deep dives on technical subjects still use clickbait titles, image previews, etc. The big channels literally have consultants that help A/B test which reaction face will get more clicks. It doesn't detract from the quality of their videos or the depth of their communities, it's just part of what you have to do to get people to care.</p><p>My experience is more in that world. I'm used to phrasing things with the explicit goal to make people click, draw their eyeballs, cause a stir, etc. By using that kind of title on the EA forum, I've probably committed a minor faux pas. &nbsp;But it actually does help me illustrate the point that EAs shouldn't be allergic to that kind of thing all the time.</p><p>EAs using factual, descriptive, neutral titles on their own forums is an interesting quirk of the community. &nbsp;But if EAs only ever use factual, descriptive, neutral language in all forums, that's a strategic mistake, and hinders their ability to effectively communicate with the public.
