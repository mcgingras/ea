Is it easily treatable?</li><li>Do more research into these 1/100 - 1/1000 life-saving impact estimates - is this realistic?</li></ul></li><li>If I decide to do it:<ul><li>Where do I buy antibiotics in the US? What kind do I buy?</li><li>will I get in trouble at customs bringing these in?</li><li>how will I explain to people how to use these antibiotics (especially in regions where I don't speak the language, which may be the areas of highest need?</li></ul></li></ul><p>I'll report back if I go through with this!</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A few other thoughts:</p><p><strong>Strongly agree with your thoughts on safety.</strong></p><p><strong>\"Just directly physically doing things seems to be high-impact in general\"</strong> - interesting.

I agree that getting stuck into doing physical things can make a huge difference.</p>\n<p>I also think that healthcare provision in truly remote places (the 10 percent most remote) is a massively neglected area</p>\n<p>Also agree that need in the Sahel is really high.</p>\n<p>I'm a doctor that runs an organization that runs remote health centers in Uganda. The biggest issue in my mind isn't that antibiotics aren't around , but that the wrong medications are given all the time either because the best medications aren't there, or because the wrong diagnosis is made. That's what or org trying to fix in remote parts of Uganda.</p>\n<p>There's a multi million dollar organization called MUSO health which works along similar ish lines. They put medications like antibiotics in the hands of village health workers, who give them out for free pretty liberally, with some idea about diagnosis but not a whole lot.</p>\n<p>Anyway I don't necessarily think your specific idea is a great way to help, but theres some good ideas in there.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "NickLaing"}}, {"_id": "MtfjswohHmrZZfMY6", "postedAt": "2023-01-15T15:55:11.627Z", "postId": "AQJ6D76CmpCjusLyf", "htmlBody": "<p>Correct downsides!
