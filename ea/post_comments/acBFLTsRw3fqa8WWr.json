Of course the lives saved is only part of what the cash does*, but if we could show that already looking only at that it was competitive, that would be a powerful message.&nbsp;<br><br>I just skimmed the article, it seems very well written (well, it's Nature, it would be!) and I'll read it more carefully later. Some very crude calculations follow:&nbsp;<br><br>The median seems to be 11% of GDP per capita. So if imagine GDP per capita as about $1,626 (representative for <a href=\"https://www.macrotrends.net/countries/SSF/sub-saharan-africa-/gdp-per-capita#:~:text=Sub%2DSaharan%20Africa%20gdp%20per%20capita%20for%202021%20was%20%241%2C626,a%207.11%25%20decline%20from%202019.\">Sub-Saharan Africa</a>), then 11% of this is about $140/year. There were 30 million adult person-years, so let's estimate 15 million person-years were for women. Three were 127,000 deaths, so let's assume 64,000 women deaths, which represented a 20% reduction. So 16,000 women's lives were saved with 15 million x $140 = $2,100m, or about $131K/life saved. Given that most of this was related to mortality at birth, we can further assume that these women would live an extra 50 years, so that <i><strong>just on lives saved alone</strong></i>, direct cash-transfers to women in sub-Saharan Africa can deliver about 50/1.31 = about <i><strong>40 WELLBY's/$100K</strong></i>. Given that this is only a small part of the total impact of cash-transfers (see quote below), this seems like an important validation of direct cash transfers to the poorest people.&nbsp;<br><br>(Very happy to have anyone correct my calculations or show me where someone has done a full analysis of this, I am just trying to get an order-of-magnitude here.
