I was exposed to arguments about AI safety before I knew much about AI and it was very confusing stuff and there is a lot that didn't add up but I still gave the EA take the benefit of the doubt since I didn't know much about AI and thought that there was something that I just didn't understand. I then spent a lot of time actually learning about AI and trying to understand what experts in the field think about what AI can actually do and what lines of research they are pursuing. Suffice it to say that the material on AGI safety didn't hold up well after this process. The AI x-risk concerns seem very quasi religious. The story is that man will create an omnipresent, omniscient and omnipotent being. Such beings are known as God in religious contexts. More moderate claims have that a being or a multiplicity of them that possess at least one of these characteristics  will be created which is more akin to gods in polytheistic religions. This being will then rain down fire and brimstone on humanity for the original sin of being imperfect which is manifested by specification of an imperfect goal. It's very similar to religious creation stories but with the role of creator reversed but the outcome is the same, Armageddon.  Given that the current prophecy seems to indicate that the apocalypse will come by 2030 it seems like  there is opportunity for a research study to be done on EA similar to that done of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/When_Prophecy_Fails\">Seekers</a>. Given this looks very much like a religious belief I doubt there is any type of argumentation that will convince the devout adherents of the ideology of the incredulity of their beliefs. There will also be a selection bias towards people who are prone to this kind of ideological beliefs similar to how some people are just prone to conspiracy theories like  QAnon albeit that AI x-risk is a lot more sophisticated.  At least the people who believe in mainstream religions are upfront that their beliefs are based on faith. The AI x-risk devotees also base their beliefs on faith but its couched in incomprehensible rationality newspeak, philosophy, absurd extrapolations and theoretical mathematical abstractions that cannot be realized in practical physical systems to give the illusion that it's more than that.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "YvTfGNpZ4Jn97h6cx", "user": {"username": "supesanon"}}, {"_id": "jc3uptD2adGQBKRdD", "postedAt": "2022-12-21T21:36:50.317Z", "postId": "T85NxgeZTTZZpqBq2", "htmlBody": "<p>Are you sure it was that course?!</p><blockquote><p>This being will then rain down fire and brimstone on humanity for the original sin of being imperfect which is manifested by specification of an imperfect goal.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;Doesn't sound very like it to me.</p>", "parentCommentId": "rmwbMoJ684qAqXzZk", "user": {"username": "Greg_Colbourn"}}, {"_id": "rZmRL8cudupjTrffF", "postedAt": "2022-12-22T21:19:47.333Z", "postId": "T85NxgeZTTZZpqBq2", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>Given this looks very much like a religious belief I doubt there is any type of argumentation that will convince the devout adherents of the ideology of the incredulity of their beliefs.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I'd be interested in whether you actually tried that, and whether it's possible to read your arguments somewhere, or whether you just saw superficial similarity between religious beliefs and the AI risk community and therefore decided that you don't want to discuss your counterarguments with anybody.</p>", "parentCommentId": "rmwbMoJ684qAqXzZk", "user": {"username": "Achim"}}, {"_id": "aZ2sqoK8H89ywWKyn", "postedAt": "2022-12-23T17:25:14.222Z", "postId": "T85NxgeZTTZZpqBq2", "htmlBody": "<p>Yup very sure.
