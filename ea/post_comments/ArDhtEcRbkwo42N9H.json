I take the point that there were sophisticated investors such as Sequioa, and BlackRock who researched the company and could not detect <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/11/technology/ftx-investors-venture-capital.html\">FTX's possible self-dealing with Alameda.</a> I think it's fair to say that EA probably could not have detected this FTX situation would blow up in exactly the way it did, even with more due diligence.</p><p>I also think that it's rational to expect that you apply due diligence to where you are <i>investing </i>your money than where you are <i>receiving </i>it from - and my understanding is that EA (on the whole) was not actually investing in FTX.&nbsp;</p><p>However, what I think should not be lost sight of is that FTX funding made up a very significant amount of EA's funding as a whole: <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/2021/07/effective-altruism-growing/\">in 2021, it was estimated FTX team's funding made up $16.5 billion of &nbsp;$46.1 billion</a> (roughly 36%). &nbsp;(Moskovitz's funding was even larger - roughly 49%.)&nbsp;</p><p>This is <i><strong>incredibly undiversified</strong></i>, especially given how volatile SBF and Moskovitz's wealth is . I am sure &nbsp;that this is far more undiversified than any large investor who actually put money in FTX. EA therefore stands to lose a lot more if the funding from FTX (or Moskovitz) fell away. I don't want this point to get lost in the debate.</p><p>Now, I'm not sure that the answer was that EA should have vetted its funding more. When people are offering you \"free\" money,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffckrr6bpqxs\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfckrr6bpqxs\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I don't think there is too much obligation to vet it (above any legal obligations that might exist). &nbsp;I think the answer is probably that EA should have thought about its risk exposure more, given how undiversified and volatile its funding is. &nbsp;In particular:</p><ul><li>what might happen if FTX or Moskovitz's funding dries up for any reason; and&nbsp;</li><li>how any negative consequences of that situation could be mitigated.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>For example, I did see somewhere that there had been a statement somewhere suggesting that EAs personally should diversify away from crypto, given how exposed EA is to it generally, but that did not seem to be a very prominent, widely-advertised piece of advice.&nbsp;</p><p>I know also that there is some general career advice for people to build up a decent financial runway for themselves. Perhaps there should have been greater emphasis to the community that if they rely on funding &nbsp;(grants, salaries) that is undiversified, they should factor that risk in and weigh it with their personal risk appetite. &nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnfckrr6bpqxs\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnreffckrr6bpqxs\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>I leave aside the question of whether SBF was using EA to \"launder\" his reputation and therefore arguably the money was not entirely \"free\".
