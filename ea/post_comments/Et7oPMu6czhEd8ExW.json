Let's take some time to reflect and update slowly as needed. First I didn't want to engage at all and saw this as a distraction. Now I'm much more up to date and see it as an opportunity to learn useful lessons about EA and myself as a person so deeply connected with this movement.</p>\n<p>Bit of a wake up call to focus on priorities and not get distracted by the drama, while taking seriously what is happening and keeping accountability within the movement. It's pretty clear something will need to change. Unclear what exactly it will be. My guess that it will be largely around things that are pretty obvious to people who are involved in the community for some time. Such as not being open enough to outside perspective. Not being careful with spending. Not that much resources flowing outside of the movement to bring talented people in. Not that much effort to bring outside sources of funding in (because of easy money we have access to).</p>\n<p>This kind of creates a bubble where everyone can think how good they are without engaging sufficiently with others. Anyway maybe that's not the lesson learned, but just my experience that I now can justify by FTX thingy happening. Still it feels like it gives EAs a permission to question the movement honestly point out core issues they are seeing without feeling like an outcast.</p>\n<p>Things are bad now is the official storyline so we can complain without worries, and that will hopefully lead to fixing things. I guess that's what identity crisis is about. And this is very interesting time to be an EA. Because we will know how it was before that FTX thing happened, haha.</p>\n<p>I believe the shift will be towards being more professional, humble and responsible. This change might help us to be more friendly and reasonable towards people who were not attracted by the EA movement even though they resonate with core ideas (senior professionals, business people, females, environment or social activists, engaged scientists, etc.)</p>\n<p>For me this definitely says I should open myself to outside perspective even more than I was doing before. By this I mean mainly perspectives of people who are in very different bubbles from mine. If they are not trusting EA, my reaction should be that of curiosity. It's much more reasonable reaction to be sceptical than to be sold right away, unless you are in very specific circumstances looking for meaning driven intellectual community.</p>\n<p>Anyway I think EAs are wonderful people and that should probably stay the way it is. We are already very diverse as far as unified communities go. But still a long way to go. My observation of the trend is that EA is becoming more diverse every year. Which is a very good sign and I'd say everyone wants this. While keeping standards of honesty and intellectual engagement high.</p>\n<p>Now we have a bit of honesty crisis, but if we own our parts we might end up stronger than ever before. One person (or few) made silly mistake. We all do from time to time, but luckily most of us doesn't have that much power to make tragic mistake. That's why honesty and transparency or integrity are important. We need some control mechanisms. Many people in this community are incredibly honest. It's not only question of saying what we believe to be true, but being honest enough internally with ourselves that we are aware what are our true believes and motivations. Because easier person to fool with virtue signaling is yourself.</p>\n<p>Anyway my tangent is getting pretty long. We will sleep few more times. Emotions will slowly fade. Only time will tell how good idea this EA project actually is and how good citizens EA aligned people are. Our goal is to contribute to our society. To make it better. So save and improve lives. To make sure future exists. These are beautiful ambitious. But we all know results is what matters. Now we collectively failed. Our hero became point of shame. Ideals were miscalibrated. We need to start again. Think better, be more honest, embrace more perspectives.</p>\n<p>EAs as good people of the world is better framing than EA maximisers. Or better ideal at least for me. We need to come back to earth and reflect on the suffering all around. That's what can keep us grounded. There is humility to acknowledging that world is too complicated for me to control it. Most people are aware of this. EAs a bit less. I think this is a bug of the movement. Not totally sure. I'm definitely not against big ambitions. I think most EAs are not really ambitious. At least less they could be. Largely status competition. But that is part of almost everything people do. Anyway acknowledging that other communities are also important and useful and being in general more appreciative of the outside world might help us to be more aware of our shortcomings and realise that we are not really better than anybody else. Even though we received big funding or have a well respected job. It doesn't mean much. How we behave towards each other and what we actually get done is what matters.</p>\n<p>We should be a community that focuses on getting things done while being kind and considerate of everyone else.

Most of the time, the lukewarm-standby organization wouldn't do much; it has a part-time staff member, some volunteer board members elected by the community (a majority of whom are not affiliated with major organizations), and a minimal fundraising campaign targeted at ordinary EA community members to ensure independence. The closest I can think of to a lukewarm-standby organization in modern life is the Selective Service System in the US (a/k/a \"the draft\"), although it is designed to potentially activate for a specific purpose rather than for a range of purposes.</p><p>However, in a crisis or where major organizations have conflicts, the lukewarm-standby organization could take in some funds and swell in size to handle whatever was needed. At the end of the crisis, the organization could disband if that was seen as prudent, and the community would create another one. For instance, in the current situation, there is potentially a need for an organization to strategize and coordinate surrounding the potential for clawbacks.

I don't want to cooperate with a lot of the PR-focused storytelling that I think EA has had far too much of in the last few years, and especially in this whole FTX situation, and I both want to be clear that I will push back on more of those kinds of narratives, and want to maybe make right now the time where we stop that kind of stuff.</p><p>It isn't my job to answer a lot of straightforward question that people have on Twitter and on the EA Forum that other EA organizational leaders are much better placed to answer, and I think many others are better places to give context and answer people's questions. When you talk about legal risk, I think you are only in a limited way talking about legal risk to the movement, but are instead primarily talking about legal risk to you personally and to your organizations, and your organizations are not the movement. I feel like when you say this, there is some equivocation that you are acting in the best interest of the movement by being hesitant around legal risk, when I think in this case that hesitation is at odds with what is actually good for the world. I have a feeling that one thing we are missing now and have missed before is courage to speak true things even when it is difficult, and I wish we had more of that right now.</p><p>Yes, you might get dragged into some terrible legal proceedings, and possibly even be fined some amount of money as you get caught in the legal crossfire. I expect given my comments on the forum I will probably also get dragged into those terrible legal proceedings. But if indeed we played a part in one of the biggest frauds of the 21st century, then I think we maybe should own up to spending a few hundred hours in legal proceedings, and take on some probability of having some adverse legal consequences. I think it's worth it for actually having us learn from this whole mess.&nbsp;</p><p>[Edit: Edited a bunch of stuff to have a somewhat more nuanced sentiment, also added an epistemic status]</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Habryka"}}, {"_id": "Ecjbxy2xjbrsuRybj", "postedAt": "2022-11-17T23:27:43.960Z", "postId": "Et7oPMu6czhEd8ExW", "htmlBody": "<p>A major consideration is that no one wants to enter a space (the EA forum) where the LW/MIRI community easily dominates voting and sentiment.

I also heard some other similar concerns for which I am still upholding confidentiality. I think this is one step more severe into the \"I assign substantial probability they lied to investors about their books and accounting\" direction, than just the points you listed above, and I think constitutes more straightforwardly criminal activity.&nbsp;</p><p>I was also quite confident, mostly based on contradictory information that I heard from people around Sam, that Sam's opinions on actual regulators and crypto-regulation were extremely cynical (in line with the Kelsey Piper interview), in contrast to the things he testified before congress, and the things he maintained publicly on Twitter and in various news articles.&nbsp;</p><p>That said, absolutely did not expect or consider that the whole thing would blow up this badly. I mean, I might have predicted with &gt;10% probability that Sam's net-worth becomes negative or zero, but I would not have predicted the business to be predicated on remotely as much fraud as it seems to have been.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, the whole situation with Sam and his propensity for dishonesty had already left a very bad taste in my mouth and had already been a major reason for why I had started disengaging from the EA community substantially more (together with the OpenAI situation which I think shares most of the same pathologies) before it all exploded. And like, I think it's &nbsp;pretty plausible I just got lucky in this specific take (not too hard given that I think I have a somewhat low opinion of multiple parts of the EA ecosystem), but I think at the moment I do want to at least explore the hypothesis pretty strongly .&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "iJmps3pARpa8y5aCn", "user": {"username": "Habryka"}}, {"_id": "Fgp36BfEReEbEww7p", "postedAt": "2022-11-18T02:48:39.503Z", "postId": "Et7oPMu6czhEd8ExW", "htmlBody": "<p>I appreciate your reply very much.</p><p>I think tension and anxiety is very high high now.&nbsp;</p><p>I want to reply to your comment.

I think this will later on make discussion easier because we will be less blinded by hindsight bias.&nbsp;</li><li>And finally, fourth, I also think that there are just a good number of people who have to make pretty crucial decisions soon because they were relying on FTX funding, and I do think the absence of information makes that topic harder to navigate. I think the people needing to make decisions here is more than just FTX grantees, since I think almost everyone working in EA, or being interested in working in EA, has plans whose details are dependent on the future funding situation</li></ul><blockquote><p>with the exception of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/3NYdEcJhxhjkybXHb/nathan-young-s-shortform?commentId=oXJucwjXH9xavSPbg\">interviews with journalists</a>, although I don't quite see why that scenario gets special treatment.</p></blockquote><p>I do think interviews with journalists are uniquely bad at communicating with the public.
