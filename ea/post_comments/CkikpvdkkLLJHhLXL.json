If everyone receives harsh criticism from their teacher or boss, in my experience this results in little resentment, and it makes the praise that much better.  When I did ballet, the criticism was almost comically harsh.  The teacher would say our dancing was &quot;ugly&quot; or &quot;stupid&quot; and that she &quot;hated&quot; it.  Sometimes she would just laugh at us.  Praise was very rare and very mild (&quot;not half-bad&quot;).  But it was the same for everyone, so almost all of us just reacted with amusement at the harshness, and I think we did become much better dancers as a result.  Contrast that with the way girls treated one another: some were popular, some were the target of cruel remarks, and in general it was very unequal.  This led to a lot of unhappiness, of course.  </p>\n<p>I'm not saying that over-the-top cruelty is the best way to deliver criticism, but I think people perceive who's popular and who's not, even if the criticism is implicit.  (Keep in mind that &quot;implicit&quot; sometimes just means passive-aggressive, which can be even more destructive.) </p>\n<p>Also keep in mind that people perceive differences in praise.  Sometimes the EA community feels a bit clique-ish.  For example, it feels kind of hurtful when someone will post statuses naming their favorite people in the EA community.  </p>\n<p>So the lesson is: don't be driven by grudges or favoritism.

For instance, if I were trying to persuade a friend that, say, global poverty causes were probably higher-impact than environmental ones, I would be very careful to say that I agreed that anthropogenic climate change was a serious problem, etc., so that the friend didn't get distracted and start hashing out carefully-rehearsed anti-climate-denial arguments.</p>\n<p>As another tip--in informal communication, I'm a big booster of using smiley faces [:)] when I say something that could be read ambiguously.

When making certain basic claims  (e.g. the importance of the far future, giving a public speech about effective altruism), we might want to err on the side of confidence, but when making more tenuous claims (e.g. regarding the effectiveness of Against Malaria Foundation versus the effectiveness of GiveDirectly), we might want to err on the side of  hedging.</p>\n<p>Another resolution is to try to come off as both confident and hedging.

I also think all of these factors are important, not only to build to strengthen our ability to be supportive of another, but also because they simply make us better decision-makers. Here's an interesting experiment on the &quot;collective intelligence&quot; of groups and what factors contribute to it:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Psychologists have repeatedly shown that a single statistical factor\u2014often called \u201cgeneral\nintelligence\u201d\u2014emerges from the correlations among people\u2019s performance on a wide variety of cognitive tasks. But no one has systematically examined whether a similar kind of \u201ccollective intelligence\u201d exists for groups of people. In two studies with 699 people, working in groups of two to five, we find converging evidence of a general collective intelligence factor that explains a group\u2019s performance on a wide variety of tasks. <strong>This \u201cc factor\u201d is not strongly correlated with the average or maximum individual intelligence of group members but is correlated with the average social sensitivity of group members, the equality in distribution of conversational turn-taking, and the proportion of females in the group.</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>My emphasis.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.chabris.com/Woolley2010a.pdf\">Here's the article (<em>Science</em>)</a> and <a href=\"http://kgajos.eecs.harvard.edu/mite/\">here's a test of social sensitivity</a>.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Stefan_Schubert"}}, {"_id": "koANXg3EsJ3jenztM", "postedAt": "2015-01-16T21:14:35.904Z", "postId": "CkikpvdkkLLJHhLXL", "htmlBody": "<p>This is nice and practical - it's good that it focusses on specific behaviours that people can practice rather than saying anything that could come across as &quot;you're alienating people and you should feel bad&quot;.</p>\n<p>One thing I'd add to this is to try to debate less and be curious more. Often discussions can turn into person A defending one position and person B rebutting this position and defending their own. I've found that it is often more helpful for both people to collaborate on analysing different models of the world in a curious way. Person A proposes a model of how the world works and person B the starts trying to understand person A's model - what its assumptions are, where it applies, and where it doesn't. They can then contrast this with other models of the world and try to work together to find out which is best. If you want to get really into it, drawing diagrams can help both because it helps you think and because it increases the sense that you are working together on a problem, rather than arguing against one another. But it doesn't have to be this formal - it could just be a friendly discussion about the strengths and weaknesses of different ideas.</p>\n<p>On a related note, I think it's important to realise that people don't always believe the positions they're arguing for. I'll often tell my friends an idea because I'm interested in working out it's strengths, weaknesses, and implications. If they're dismissive and try to argue against it I feel that they're missing the point - it would be more helpful to explore the idea's strengths and weaknesses together rather than turning it into a debate.

We all need support, but individuals vary considerably in the kind of support they need in order to flourish.</strong> A kind of support that works well for one person might feel patronising, frustrating or stifling to another, or cold, distant and uncaring to a third. To be effectively supportive, we must be sensitive to individual needs. </p>\n<p><strong>2. Being supportive is difficult, so individuals in the community should help others support them.</strong> If the support you're getting from the community is suboptimal, it's unlikely that other individuals are <em>entirely</em> to blame. </p>\n<p><strong>3. As a community, we should create an atmosphere where it's easy for people to ask for more or different kinds of support when they need to.</strong> Admitting vulnerability and requesting support is a sign of strength and maturity, not weakness, so we should praise, encourage and reward those who do this. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Peter_Hartree"}}, {"_id": "KRTSxg4vD8xT3CHnB", "postedAt": "2015-01-25T14:37:50.893Z", "postId": "CkikpvdkkLLJHhLXL", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks Ben - great guidelines!</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "oE6pKMrWzwec9Tuoy", "user": {"username": "Michelle_Hutchinson"}}, {"_id": "9djx3X98caHSTHpJS", "postedAt": "2015-01-25T14:46:15.367Z", "postId": "CkikpvdkkLLJHhLXL", "htmlBody": "<p>I definitely agree it seems important to create a community atmosphere that's appealing in itself, tricky as that is likely to be. \nAs you say, the compliments need to not just be sincere, but the kind that come across as sincere.
