(I'm discussing more generally the implications of limited aggregation, but as you note contractualism has primarily distinct implications because of its (partially) non-aggregative nature.) While I mostly agree with your claims about the implications of the ex ante view, I disagree with your claim that this is the most plausible version of contractualism. In fact, I think that the ex ante view is clearly wrong and we should not be much concerned with what it implies.</p><p>First, briefly to the application part. I think you are right that, given the ex ante view, we should not focus on mitigating x-risks, and that we should rather perform global health interventions. However, as you note, there is usually a very large group of potential beneficiaries when it comes to global health interventions, so that the probability for each individual to be benefited is quite small, resulting in heavily diminished ex ante claims. I wonder, therefore, if we shouldn't, on the ex ante view, rather spend our resources on (relatively needy) people we know or people in small communities. Even if these people would benefit from our resources 100+ times less than the global poor, this could well be overcompensated by the much higher probabilities for each of these individuals to actually be benefited.&nbsp;</p><p>But again, I think the ex ante view is clearly false anyway. The easiest way to see this is that the view implies that we should prioritize one identified person over any number of \"statistical\" people. That is: on the ex ante view, we should save a given person for sure rather than (definitely!) save one <i>million </i>people if these are randondomly chosen from a sufficiently large population. In fact, there are even worse implications (the identified person could merely lose a finger and not her life if we don't help), but I think this implication is already bad enough to confidently reject the view. I don't know of anybody who is willing to accept that implication. The typical (if not universal?) reaction of advocates of the ex ante view is to go <i>pluralist </i>and claim that the verdicts of the ex ante view only correspond to one of several pro tanto reasons. As far as I know, no such view has actually been developed and I think any such view would be highly implausible as well; but even if it succeeded, its implications would be much more moderate: all we'd learn is that there is one of several pro tanto reasons that favour acting in (presumably) some short-term way. This could be well compatible with classic long-term interventions being overall most choiceworthy / obligatory.</p><p>I'm sure that I'm not telling you much, if anything, new here, so I wonder what you think of these arguments?&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Jakob Lohmar"}}, {"_id": "e2eCfTEQwpQQdB5Ro", "postedAt": "2023-10-13T23:44:10.680Z", "postId": "3KsvReHD6CckfwHak", "htmlBody": "<p>I'm far from an expert on contractualism, but iirc it's standardly presented as a theory of just <i>one part</i> of morality, which Scanlon characterizes as \"what we owe to each other\".

I'm not sure how much weight to put on \"similar\" in your question. In general, you'd be looking to minimize the greatest strength-weighted complaint that someone might have. Imagine a simple case where all the individuals in two equally-sized populations you might help are at risk of dying, which means that the core content of the complaint would be the same. Then, we just have the strength-weighting to worry about. The two key parts of that (at least for present purposes) would be the probability of harm, your probability of impact, and the magnitude of the impact you can have. So, we multiply through to figure out who has the strongest claim. In a case like this, intervention prioritization looks very similar to what we already do in EA. However, in cases where the core contents of the complaints are different (death vs. quality of life improvements, say), the probabilities might not end up mattering. Or in cases where your action would have high EV but only because you're aggregating over a very large population where each individual has a very low chance of harm, it could easily work out that, according to EAC, you should get less EV by benefitting individuals who are exposed to much greater risk of harm.

So, yes, it could definitely work out that, given contractualism, EA has the wrong priorities even within the global health space, but isofar as some popular interventions are focused on inexpensive ways of saving lives, we've got at least a few considerations that strongly support those interventions.

When it comes to moral theory, we're in a \"pick your poison\" situation. There are certainly <i>some </i>views I'm willing to write off as \"clearly false,\" but I wouldn't say that of most versions of contractualism. In general, my approach to applied ethics is to say, \"Moral theory is brutally hard and often the best we can do is try to assess whether we end up in roughly the same spot practically regardless of where we start theoretically.\" Second, and in the same spirit, my main goal here is to complement Emma Curran's work: she's already defended the same conclusion for the ex post version of the view. So, it's progress enough to show that, whichever way you go, you get something other than prioritizing x-risk. Third, the ex ante view doesn't imply that we should prioritize one identified person over <i>any</i> number of \"statistical\" people unless all else is equal---and all else often isn't equal. I grant that there are going to be lots of cases where identified lives trump statistical lives, but for the kinds of reasons I mentioned when thinking about your great application question, we still need to sort out the details re: claim strength.<br><br>Really appreciate the very helpful engagement!</p>", "parentCommentId": "fouudjsEHBoKSbE9s", "user": {"username": "bob-fischer"}}, {"_id": "xx79Pmv7bYvk5GQ6J", "postedAt": "2023-10-14T13:12:11.044Z", "postId": "3KsvReHD6CckfwHak", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for your helpful reply! I'm very sympathetic to your view on moral theory and applied ethics: most (if not all) moral theories face severe problems and that is not generally sufficient reason to not consider them when doing applied ethics. However, I think the ex ante view is one of those views that don't deserve more than negligible weight - which is where we seem to have different judgments. Even when taking into consideration that alternative views have their own problems, the statistical lives problem seems to be as close to a \"knock-down argument\" as it gets. You are right that there are possible circumstances in which the ex ante view would not prioritize identified people over any number of \"statistical\" people, and these circumstances might be even common. But the fact remains that there are also possible circumstances in which the ex ante view <i>does </i>prioritize one identified person over <i>any </i>number of \"statistical\" people - and at least to me this is just \"clearly wrong\".

Now, maybe there are people who are particularly prone to death if they catch malaria and are identifiable as such, e.g. the identified immunocompromised. How high can the maximum ex ante risk be across individuals? I don't know, but this could matter. Let's say it's 1%. I think it could be much higher, but let's go with that to illustrate here first.</p><p>With up to $100,000 dollars donated to AMF and Malaria Consortium, suppose then we can practically eliminate one such person's risk of death, dropping it from 1% to around 0% (if we know where AMF and MC will work with that extra funding). On the other hand, it seems hard to see how only $100,000 dollars targeted at catastrophic risks could reduce anyone's risk of death by 1 percentage point. That would fund at most something like 2 people working full-time for a year, and probably less than 1 at most organizations working on x-risk, given current salaries. That will be true separately for the next $100,000, and the next, and the next, and so on, probably up to at least the endowment of Open Phil.</p><p>However, what about all of what Open Phil is granting to GiveWell, $100 million/year (<a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2023/10/06/open-philanthropys-2023-2025-funding-for-givewells-recommendations/\">source</a>), <i>all together</i>, rather than $100K at a time? That still, by assumption, only gives a 1 percentage point reduction in mortality across the beneficiaries of GiveWell recommendations, if malaria mortality rates are representative (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ROI6dRdKsNfXg5gIyBa1_7eYOjowfbw5n65zkrLnvc/edit#gid=1070538669&amp;range=A31\">it seems it could be somewhat higher for Helen Keller International</a>, and <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18ROI6dRdKsNfXg5gIyBa1_7eYOjowfbw5n65zkrLnvc/edit#gid=1176773164&amp;range=A86\">somewhat higher for New Incentives</a>, if we account for individuals at increase personal risk for those, too, and that covers the rest of GiveWell's top charities). Can we reduce global catastrophic risks by more than 1 percentage point with a $100 million? What about $100 million/year over multiple years? I think many concerned with AI risk would say yes. And it might even be better for those who would otherwise receive bednets to protect them from malaria.</p><p>Now, malaria incidence can be as high as around 300 cases per 1000 people a given year in some places where AMF works (<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/malaria#malaria-incidence\">Our World in Data</a>).

But perhaps other people think privileging Mary's life over every American having 3 dollars (the equivalent on the margin to 330 million used books or 330 million ice cream cones) is defensible or even morally obligatory. Well it so happens that 3 dollars is close to the price of a antimalarial <a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/dollarspernet.aspx\">bednet</a>. My guess is that contractualism, even under the more relaxed versions, will have trouble coming up with why preventing some number of people (remember, contractualism doesn't do aggregations!) having a ~50% chance of getting malaria and a ~0.3% chance of dying is morally preferable to preventing someone from dying with probability ~1. This despite the insecticidal bednets potentially saving tens or even hundreds of thousands of lives in expectation!&nbsp;<br><br>But I guess one person's modus tollens is another's modus ponens. What I consider to be a rejection of contractualism can also logically be interpreted by others as a rejection of AMF, in favor of much more expensive interventions that can save someone's life with probability closer to 1. (And in practice, I wouldn't be surprised if the actual price to save a life for someone operating under this theory is more like a million dollars than a billion). So I would guess people who believe in contractualism as applied to charities to end up making pretty radically different choices than the current EA set of options.</p><p>EDIT: 2023/10/15: I see that <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/3KsvReHD6CckfwHak/if-contractualism-then-amf?commentId=fouudjsEHBoKSbE9s\">Jakub</a> has already made the same point I had before I commented, just more abstract and philosophical.&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fncej097vw92n\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefcej097vw92n\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>A related issue with this form of contractualism is its demandingness, which taken literally seems more demanding than even naive act utilitarianism.

In this case, if you were to save Nora, then, plausibly, the additional person on the side of the many has a complaint, for you would thereby treat the case as though the additional person weren't even there. (Recall that we\u2019re supposing that Scanlon\u2019s argument described above succeeds.) So, you ought to do something appropriately responsive to the additional person\u2019s presence.

So by induction, ice cream should be relevant to any number of extra seconds of life lost to an individual.</p>\n<p>However, the inductive step could fail (with high probability). Where it could fail seems kind of arbitrary, but we could just have moral uncertainty about that.</p>\n<p>Also, there are nonarbitrary (but uncertain) places it could fail for this specific sequence. Some people have important life goals that are basically binary, e.g. getting married. Losing enough years of life will prevent those goals from being fulfilled.

A few thoughts.</p><p>First, the point of this post is to make a case for the conditional, not for contractualism. So, I'm more worried about \"contractualism won't get you AMF\" than I am about \"contractualism is false.\" I assumed that most readers would be skeptical of this particular moral theory. The goal here isn't to say, \"If contractualism, then AMF---so 100% of resources should go to AMF.\" Instead, it's to say, \"If contractualism, then AMF---so if you put any credence behind views of this kind at all, then it probably isn't the case that 100% of resources should go to x-risk.\"</p><p>Second, on \"contractualism won't get you AMF,\" thanks to Michael for making the move I'd have suggested re: relevance. Another option is to think in terms of either nonideal theory or moral uncertainty, depending on your preferences. Instead of asking, \"Of all possible actions, which does contractualism favor?\" We can ask: \"Of the actual options that a philanthropist takes seriously, which does contractualism favor? It may turn out that, for whatever reason, only high-EV options are in the set of actual options that the philanthropist takes seriously, in which case it doesn't matter whether a given version of contractualism wouldn't select all those options to begin with. Then, the question is whether they're uncertain enough to allow other moral considerations to affect their choice from among the pre-set alternatives.</p><p>Finally, on the statistical lives problem for contractualism, I'm mostly inclined to shrug off this issue as bad but not a dealbreaker. This is basically for a meta-theoretic reason. I think of moral theories as attempts to systematize our considered judgments in ways that make them seem principled. Unfortunately, our considered judgments conflict quite deeply. Some people's response to this is to lean into the process of reflective equilibrium, giving up either principles or judgments in the quest for perfect consistency. My own experience of doing this is that the push for *more* consistency is usually good, whereas the push for *perfect* consistency almost always means that people endorse theories with implications that I find horrifying *that they come to believe are not horrifying,* as they follow from a beautifully consistent theory. I just can't get myself to believe moral theories that are that revisionary. (I'm reporting here, not arguing.) So, I prefer relying on a range of moral theories, acknowledging the problems with each one, and doing my best to find courses of action that are robustly supported across them. In my view, EAC is based on the compelling thought that we ought to protect the known-to-be-most vulnerable, even at the cost of harm to the group. In light of this, what makes identified lives special is just that we can tell who the vulnerable are. So sure, I feel the force of the thought experiments that people offer to motivate the statistical lives problem; sure, I'm strongly inclined to want to save more lives in those cases. But I'm not so confident to rule out EAC entirely. So, EAC stays in the toolbox as one more resource for moral deliberation.</p>", "parentCommentId": "R2hCcDoqoPpieF98J", "user": {"username": "bob-fischer"}}, {"_id": "zuL7TS4noQNvGEsA5", "postedAt": "2023-10-16T17:03:22.465Z", "postId": "3KsvReHD6CckfwHak", "htmlBody": "<p>I don't see a coherent view of people that doesn't have some version of this.

There are two ways of talking about personal identity over time.

For example, mitigating emissions for climate change should be ignored, because we can do more good for current people by mitigating harms rather than preventing them, and should emit more and ignore the fact that this will, with certainty, make the future worse, because those people don't have much of a moral claim.
