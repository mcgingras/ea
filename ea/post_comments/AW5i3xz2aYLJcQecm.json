This depends on many uncertaint factors.</li><li>The relative value of scheming depends partly on how much the model stands to gain from not scheming, which varies based on factors like goal ambition.</li><li>There are open questions around necessary goal time horizons and whether default goals will be highly ambitious.</li><li>The challenges don't decisively refute the story but highlight the need to clarify the necessary conditions.</li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>This comment was auto-generated by the EA Forum Team.
