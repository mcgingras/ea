While I've not been at FHI much in recent years (due to busyness elsewhere) I remember the FHI of that time being a truly unique-in-academia place; devoted to letting and helping brilliant people think about important challenges in unusual ways. That was in very large part down to Nick - he is visionary, and remarkably stubborn and difficult - with the benefits and drawbacks this comes with. It is difficult to understate the degree of pressure in academia to pull you away from doing something unique and visionary and to instead do more generic things, put time into impressing committees, keeping everyone happy etc**. - It's that stubbornness (combined with the vision) in my view that allowed FHI to come into being and thrive (at least for a time). It is (in my view) the same stubbornness and difficultness that contributes to other issues noted in in the post.&nbsp;<br><br>Whether Nick was the right leader at that time isn't a question to me - FHI couldn't have happened under anyone else. And the great work done by multiple people there (not just Nick), and a fairly remarkable range of fhi alumni post-fhi, must stand to that vision. Whether a different leader would be able to keep the positive aspects of the vision - and fight for them - while also being able to address the problems - maybe, I don't know.&nbsp;<br><br>One model FHI might consider is a meaningful, and properly empowered, co-directorship model. I felt I had a good relationship with Nick at the time, and was able to regularly shut down ideas I thought foolish or unnecessarily annoying to the university (although it was stressful). I was also able to put time into maintaining university relationships for FHI, which seemed to keep things on the rails. But that required me being pretty stubborn too, and it seems like others may have had less success in this regard later on (although I know little of the details). &nbsp;It may be possible to make such a model work, with a properly empowered fellow director (e.g. an exec director / research director model).<br><br>* I am not taking a position on issues raised in the post such as whether Nick's brand is too damaged, etc. This may be the case. For whatever it's worth I never saw/heard racist views during my time at FHI (if I had, I would have left). I do recall initiatives, enthusiastically initiated by Nick, to engage and support scholars from under-represented regions like South America, and to encourage intellectual hubs outside of Europe/North America.<br>** &nbsp;I've spent a lot of time trying to navigate these things in academia, and have the scar tissue to show for it.</p>", "parentCommentId": "kWbuhNbgSww2pHpDr", "user": {"username": "Sean_o_h"}}, {"_id": "JjpKSbqrQGZoQaETW", "postedAt": "2023-03-04T16:38:25.898Z", "postId": "Riqg9zDhnsxnFrdXH", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for sharing your perspective, it's useful to hear!</p>", "parentCommentId": "tMzhoDakvvkYzot7C", "user": {"username": "ThomasWoodside"}}, {"_id": "mLfRDG8bqQaytXKeP", "postedAt": "2023-03-04T17:51:16.071Z", "postId": "Riqg9zDhnsxnFrdXH", "htmlBody": "<p>This post argues that:</p><ul><li>Bostrom's micromanagement has led to FHI having staff retention problems.</li><li>Under his leadership, there have been considerable tensions with Oxford University and a hiring freeze.</li><li>In his racist apology, Bostrom failed to display tact, wisdom and awareness.</li><li>Furthermore, this apology has created a breach between FHI and its closest collaborators and funders.</li><li>Both the mismanagement of staff and the tactless apology caused <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JonasSandbrink/status/1631677090591375364\">researchers to renounce</a>.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>While I'd love for FHI staff to comment and add more context, all of this matches my impressions.&nbsp;</p><p>Given this, <strong>I stand with the message of the post</strong>.

You mention funding, but don't provide any evidence this will prevent FHI from fundraising; any funder that wants to promote a diverse and inclusive group of intellectuals producing novel work will have to accept that they will sometimes strongly disagree with grantees. Similarly, freedom of speech is a major concern for the english government right now, and it is currently passing a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_Education_(Freedom_of_Speech)_Bill\">law </a>to help combat cancel culture and defend academic freedom against pressure from university administrators.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, I'm not sure what you're referring to by 'discredited race science'. As I discussed with Habiba, Bostrom's views are not very different from those of scientifically informed leading <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8zLwD862MRGZTzs8k/a-personal-response-to-nick-bostrom-s-apology-for-an-old?commentId=7APNarGbWZuozkpNA\">anti-racism campaigners</a>.

Or at least I think the reasons in this post are not very good reasons for Bostrom to step down (it is plausible to me he could pursue more impactful plans somewhere else, potentially by starting a new research institution with less institutional baggage and less interference by the University of Oxford).</p><p>Bostrom is as far as I can tell the primary reason why FHI is a successful and truth-oriented research organization. Making a trustworthy research institution is exceptionally difficult, and its success is not primarily measured in the operational quality of its organization, but in the degree to which it produces important, trustworthy and insightful research. Bostrom has succeeded at this, and the group of people (especially the early FHI cast including Anders Sandberg, Eric Drexler, Andrew Snyder Beattie, Owain Evans, and Stuart Armstrong) he has assembled under the core FHI research team have made great contributions to many really important questions that I care about, and I cannot think of any other individual who would have been able to do the same (Sean gives a similar perspective in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Riqg9zDhnsxnFrdXH/nick-bostrom-should-step-down-as-director-of-fhi?commentId=tMzhoDakvvkYzot7C\">his comment</a>).</p><p>I think Bostrom overstretched himself when he let FHI grow to dozens and hundreds of people, and this seems to me like it was a mistake, and leaned too hard on skills that are hard to combine with intellectual integrity and vision, and skills that Bostrom otherwise does not seem exceptionally strong at (like navigating university politics and facilitating operational scaling). I do think that aspect of FHI has recently run into a bunch of problems, but at what I think of FHI's core responsibility he has done very exceptional work and I see no suitable replacement for Bostrom at this point.</p><p>When I think of the value that FHI has produced for the world it has been in the unabashed exploration of ideas, with great willingness to explore wherever they go, even if this might involve engaging with ideas that are scary, sound crazy and speculative, or are societally taboo. To me, the core value add of FHI has always seemed to me to be one of providing a beacon, and one of the world's best places to work at, for people who want to take ideas seriously and think rigorously about the future. The cultural components to create this kind of environment are very rare, and do not exist almost anywhere else in the world (and for example, IMO very clearly do not exist at GCRI or CSER or CSET or OpenAI or Anthropic or Longview or CLTR).&nbsp;</p><p>I think these are the things to pay attention when evaluating the historical performance of Bostrom's FHI. Not on the basis of the organizations ability to write PR-statements, or scale a large research lab while navigating politically difficult relationships with a 1000 year old university. &nbsp;Most well-run large research labs with squeaky-clean public image do not answer interesting questions that are crucial to humanity's future, in a way that a a reader can trust is actually driven by the desire to get the right answer, as opposed to pushing some kind of political or intellectual agenda. Indeed, I personally trust people more who don't spend a huge chunk of their energy trying to maintain a completely clean public image.&nbsp;</p><p>For basically any other organization that is not FHI that pursues similar questions, when I read their takes on the macrohistory, or the future of humanity, I usually primarily see attempts to spread some ideology, to gain resources for some interest group, or attempts to build some sphere of influence by telling the right kind of macrohistory. For core FHI work, like \"Eternity in Six Hours\" (one of the papers that's been most influential on my world view) I see what seems to me genuine interest in figuring out the truth and to answer the big questions, instead of secretly trying to trick me into supporting them, or get me to buy into their ideology, or support their favorite political cause or social movement, or to suspiciously shy away from a conclusion whenever that conclusion would be too hard to defend publicly to people who only want to spend 5 minutes on this question.</p><p>It is possible, and would be very sad, that FHI sadly cannot continue being this beacon, both because it scaled too quickly and its cultural magic is therefore no longer there, and because it is too deeply entwined with the University of Oxford, which will smother both its operational capacity and intellectual exploration.&nbsp;</p><p>In that case, I think the right choice is not for Bostrom to leave FHI, but for FHI to shut down. FHI is responsible for many of the best intellectual contributions for exploring the future of humanity, and I think before we do something that would substantially sabotage that legacy, it would be better to close down in a structured manner. I think it would be bad to let it fall in the hands of someone interested in making FHI into just another talent funnel, or another machine for producing prestige for Effective Altruism or AI Alignment or the people running FHI, while using up the credibility and intellectual integrity of Bostrom and many other core researchers who have created one of the highest integrity research institutions in the world.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't know enough details about the FHI situation to have a strong judgement on whether Bostrom should stay and try to right the ship, or shut FHI down, but I think asking Bostrom to step down because of controversies belies the value that FHI most provides for the world.&nbsp;</p><p>I do think it is plausible that we should consider FHI a lesson on why getting too involved with risk-averse institutions will ultimately bite us, and we should be more hesitant to embed ourselves deeply into institutions like Oxford university. If indeed FHI is irrevocably tied to Oxford, and Oxford is unlikely to give FHI the operational and intellectual independence it needs, then I strongly encourage Bostrom to close down FHI, and to start something new with more independence, less need for both difficult PR work, and less need for navigating messy university politics.&nbsp;</p><p>It's also possible to me that <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Riqg9zDhnsxnFrdXH/nick-bostrom-should-step-down-as-director-of-fhi?commentId=tMzhoDakvvkYzot7C\">Sean's proposal</a> of finding a co-director to run FHI with might be the best choice, and might allow Bostrom to focus more on producing great research, and run a somewhat larger organization at the same time, though of course and finding such a co-director is also very difficult (though does seem easier than finding someone to lead the institution fully on their own).</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Habryka"}}, {"_id": "xortAY97HemcLE2kx", "postedAt": "2023-03-05T01:04:22.800Z", "postId": "Riqg9zDhnsxnFrdXH", "htmlBody": "<p>Edit: I want to make it clear that I am talking about \u201cgenetic\u201d differences not \u201cenvironmental\u201d differences in this comment.

The survey of experts finds that far more experts believe both genetic factors and environmental factors play a role than just environmental factors.

Yes, some studies will have flaws, but that means you have conversations about the significance of these flaws and respect that reasonable people can disagree about how best to measure complicated issues. It doesn't mean &nbsp;you dismiss everyone who agrees with the standard perspectives of experts in an academic field as racist. My favorite thing about this community is the epistemic humility. &nbsp;We are supposed to be the people who judge studies on their merits, no matter how uncomfortable they make us feel.

In the best study he found, about four times as many experts agreed with the belief that the OP believes &nbsp;is discredited than disagreed. There is <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/reducing-lead-poisoning#:~:text=The%20cost%20of%20the%20problem,third%20child%20in%20the%20world.\">abundant data</a> that lead poisoning impairs cognition, and that a third of children are victims of lead poisoning. Roughly a third of GiveWell's <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/our-criteria/cost-effectiveness/cost-effectiveness-models\">estimate</a> of the value of preventing malaria comes from long term income gains, implying that malaria often impairs the cognitive development of its victims in both direct and indirect ways. Economic changes have produced the <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4152423/\">Flynn Effect</a> of IQs typically increasing as countries get richer. People's protection from the economic and medical harms that these studies observe vary widely depending on what country they are born into. Countries happen to have different racial makeups from each other. Family differences in IQ perpetuate themselves because people tend to marry other &nbsp;people with similar IQs. If there are genetic differences in average IQ between races, &nbsp;there is no reason to think they wouldn\u2019t go away if unequal access to resources did. I don't view this data as evidence of innate intelligence differences between races, but as a call to arms to work till every child has equal opportunities to live up to their full potential no matter how poor their parents are.&nbsp;</p><p>In his apology statement, Bostrom refused to state an opinion about whether environmental factors influence cognitive development, &nbsp;whether some races have less access to protection from harmful environmental factors on average, and whether people are more likely to marry people that are more economically similar to themselves.

Unfortunately, I have to step in and point out that this comment is inaccurate/misleading when it comes to the science and the descriptions of peoples beliefs.&nbsp;</p><p>Lead poisoning, the flynn effect, and malaria are all <i>environmental</i> factors, not genetic ones. nobody who has read up on the issue denies that average IQ test scores are different for different races, the argument is about how much of the difference is attributable to environmental factors. &nbsp;(I'm pretty sure that Bostrom did claim an opinion about whether \"environmental factors influence cognitive development\", because the answer is an uncontroversial yes.&nbsp;</p><p>If the differences were near-entirely genetic in nature, then eliminating unequal access to resources, lead poisoning, different cultures, etc, &nbsp;wouldn't have any effect on IQ differences, because it wouldn't affect genes. Holding this position requires thinking that there aren't any significant differences in environment between the races that could affect IQ significantly. I think this view is fairly extreme and unlikely, and I think it would be fair to call this position \"discredited\". &nbsp;The IQ gap between black people and white people in america is only in the range of 9-15 points, and environmental factors can affect IQ test scores on that magnitude: one study found that adopting a poor kid could jump their <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-big-idea/2017/6/15/15797120/race-black-white-iq-response-critics\">IQ test scores by 12-18 points</a>. &nbsp;</p><p>Bostrom didn't take this position, he just said it is unknown how much the gap is genetic vs environmental, which is true. Social science is very difficult, the only way to truly know the answer is to end all environmental differences and to see what happens, which is impossible given that this includes things like cultural differences, or to find a measurable thing in biology that corresponds to IQ test scores (which I've seen biologists express skepticism about).&nbsp;</p><p>The real problem with these discussions is that full on KKK style racist people exist, have a loud voice on the internet, and are extremely keen to use the uncertainty above as a bludgeon against minorities. It's a classic motte and bailey: you go from \"the causes of the racial IQ test score gap are unknown\" to \"it's mostly genetic\", to \"black people are dumber than white people and you should discriminate against them\". &nbsp;I think one of the key mistakes Bostrom made was not being 100%, explicitly, forcefully anti-racist in his apology, because they absolutely have used it and the subsequent controversy as a recruiting ground for their ideas.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "xortAY97HemcLE2kx", "user": {"username": "titotal"}}, {"_id": "hifQWqRHPif3pSRXW", "postedAt": "2023-03-05T20:42:26.586Z", "postId": "Riqg9zDhnsxnFrdXH", "htmlBody": "<p>I realize I wasn\u2019t clear enough that I was talking about genetic stuff the whole time in my comment.

Moreover, I understand that in a social movement made up of thousands of people, you are not going to be able to find common agreement on every issue and in order to make progress we need to find some way to deal with that.

Being a good leader means things like being able to communicate well and understand when your actions will have predictably bad consequences, avoid making everyone really uncomfortable about working with you, and avoid getting your organization to the point where you can't hire anyone and your operations staff and other key leadership quit. To be frank - a lot of Bostrom's research is great and I'm very grateful to him for a lot of it, but this benchmark is just something Bostrom isn't accomplishing and I think independent researcher life would suit him better and be a win-win for everyone.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "t99CfxyGd4oqz82dd", "user": {"username": "Peter_Hurford"}}, {"_id": "ELrvECfpc4BmE5YGP", "postedAt": "2023-03-06T01:52:43.420Z", "postId": "Riqg9zDhnsxnFrdXH", "htmlBody": "<p>Do you think there is a way we could score FHI in a way that would be comparable in the worlds with and without Bostrom?</p><p>If so, this really does seem like a place for prediction markets.</p>", "parentCommentId": "gjc5FswcAwTQpsPfs", "user": {"username": "nathan"}}, {"_id": "mobz6x57K8bEhC2aZ", "postedAt": "2023-03-06T01:59:24.861Z", "postId": "Riqg9zDhnsxnFrdXH", "htmlBody": "<p>From where I sit -It's really hard to guess at all the details and relevant context of what's going on (which is why I feel a bit stupid commenting on it... but I guess I can't resist lol).<br><br>Is FHI the only org being subject to a hiring freeze?

I believe this could be an example of how the weakening of empistemics because people are starting to work so hard to ignore research that makes them uncomfortable  could spread to other topics.  The inaccuracy of the author's statement also makes the preserving epistemic integrity case for standing up for Bostrom (possibly via Habryka's suggestion for example) much stronger.

I offer no view on any of that. Instead, I wish to say that Bostrom, and by extension the FHI, has been far more seriously damaged by both his 1996 comments and his 2023 apology than some of the comments here disagreeing with the view of the OP recognise. As an adult and a scholar well into his 20s, Bostrum \"liked\" and thought true the sentence; \"blacks are more stupid than whites\". It is not possible to deconstruct these words in a way which makes them publicly benign. His apology this year contains disastrous caveats which reflect ambiguity on his part on matters of race and IQ, and even eugenics. The fact that some commenters here have sought (genuinely benignly) to contextualise his ambiguity by referring to authors such as Rindermann and Snyderman illustrates the thin-ness of the ice around the hole Bostrom has fallen (or hurled himself) into. Like some other commenters, I dislike the seemingly ubiquitous \"discredited\" epithet often used to refer to science which is potentially unpalatable to the wider public. It is also true that geneticists, for example, invariably finesse the word \"eugenics\" to refer only to pre-war atrocities in order to protect their present work from harm; it is of course perfectly legitimate to consider some lines of contemporary genetics research as essentially eugenic in nature (see Agar, for example). I imagine this is Bostrum's view, too. But the simple fact is that all serious scientists understand the need to be extraordinarily careful around issues of race and biology; those who chose to focus on or even be ambiguous about that area, like Rindermann and Snyderman, and indeed their associate Richard Lynn, are usually very open about the highly controversial nature of their personal opinions and choose a marginalised academic life. Bostrum's foray into these areas in his apology, along with the absurdly ill-advised opening sentences, conveyed the strong impression both that he did not feel the need to make a heartfelt apology and that he thought he could deal with the story by making a reluctant sort-of-apology. These would be serious offences for any senior scholar, but Bostrom trades in large part on his understanding of the future needs of humanity. If his understanding of humanity is suspected by people to contain a hint of what most people would consider racism, then his thinking cannot be applied to anything. Since he regards himself as an applied thinker, his work is therefore potentially over. I appreciate that some commenters here might consider that an overstatement, and of course it may turn out to be. But a glance at the US context will reveal, I think, that no-one beyond over enthusiastic tech titans will touch Bostrom with a bargepole now. There can be no doubt that he will have to step down as FHI leader, and he will continue to harm FHI if he remains there at all. He will, indeed, continue to harm Oxford if he remains a tenured professor; and so I think he will likely have to resign from that too. He might have recourse to a new appointment elsewhere in a few years, but that would require a great deal of work on his part which I am far from convinced he is psychologically capable of. The OP is therefore, &nbsp;in my opinion, absolutely right. The FHI is in trouble and Bostrom's association with it now could feasibly sink it in its current form.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Richard Braden"}}, {"_id": "cDEkc83BtCtZTAKRY", "postedAt": "2023-06-07T20:35:55.948Z", "postId": "Riqg9zDhnsxnFrdXH", "htmlBody": "<p>The more important metric to me will be if it is possible to do highly (preferably positively) impactful work while collaborating with universities, which I've seen positive evidence from individual professors/labs but not for larger groups.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "rNiDn9qYBfeAW79tw", "user": {"username": "Linch"}}, {"_id": "uzxiuA7fvNbuat4ES", "postedAt": "2023-03-07T03:25:44.920Z", "postId": "Riqg9zDhnsxnFrdXH", "htmlBody": null, "parentCommentId": null, "user": null}]
