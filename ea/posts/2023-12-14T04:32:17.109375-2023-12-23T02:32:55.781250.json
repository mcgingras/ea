I am as guilty of this as anyone<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyh8jw8lhcfq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyh8jw8lhcfq\">[1]</a></sup></span>\u2013but after the OpenAI disaster, it is irresponsible not to update on what happened and the new situation. While it still makes sense to emphasize and prioritize friendliness and cooperation, it may be time to also adopt some of the lowercase \u201cp\u201d political advocacy tools used by other civil society organizations and groups.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjli2eazbcxk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjli2eazbcxk\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>As far as is known publicly, the OpenAI disaster began with Sam Altman attempting to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KXHMCH7wCxrvKsJyn/openai-facts-from-a-weekend?commentId=3cj6qhSRt4HoBLpC7\"><u>purge</u></a> the board of serious AI safety advocates and it ended with him successfully purging the board of serious AI safety advocates. (As well as him gaining folk hero status for his actions while AI safety advocacy was roundly defamed, humiliated, and shown to be powerless.) During the events in between, various stakeholders flexed their power to bring about this outcome.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Sam Altman began implementing plans to gut OpenAI, first privately and then with the aid of Microsoft.</li><li>Satya Nadella and Microsoft began implementing a plan to defund and gut OpenAI.</li><li>Employees\u2013and especially those with an opportunity to cash out their equity\u2014threatened to resign <i>en masse</i> and go to Microsoft\u2013risking the existence of OpenAI.</li><li>Various prominent individuals used their platforms to exert pressure and spin up social media campaigns\u2013especially on Twitter.</li><li>Social media campaigns on Twitter exercised populist power to severely criticize and, in some cases, harass the safety advocates on the board. (And AI safety advocacy and advocates more broadly.)</li></ul><p>If there is reason to believe that AI will not be safe by default\u2013and there is\u2013AI safety advocates need to have the ability to exercise some influence over actions of major actors\u2013especially labs. We bet tens of millions of dollars and nearly a decade of ingratiating ourselves to OpenAI (and avoiding otherwise valuable actions for fear they may be seen as hostile) in the belief that board seats could provide this influence. We were wrong and wrong in a way that blew up in our faces terribly.</p><p>It is important that we not overreact and alienate groups and people we need to be able to work with, but it is also important that we demonstrate that we are\u2013like Sam, Satya, OpenAI\u2019s employees, prominent individuals, social media campaigns, and most civil society groups everywhere\u2013a constituency that has lowercase \u201cp\u201d power and a place at the negotiating table for major decisions. (You will note, these other parties are brought to the table not despite their willingness to exercise some amount of coercive power, but at least in part because of it.)</p><p>I believe the first move in implementing a more typical civil society advocacy approach is to push back in a measured way against OpenAI\u2013or better yet Sam Altman. The comment section below might be a good location to brainstorm.&nbsp;</p><p>Some tentative ideas:</p><ul><li>An open letter\u2013with prominent signatories, but also open for signatures from thousands of others\u2013raising concerns about Sam\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/altman-firing-openai-520a3a8c\"><u>well-documented scheming</u></a> and deception to remove AI safety advocates from OpenAI\u2019s board of directors and his betrayal of OpenAI, its mission, and his own alleged values<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5yf3jpmzn8q\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5yf3jpmzn8q\">[3]</a></sup></span>, in his subsequent attempt to destroy OpenAI as a personal vendetta for being let go in response. This is the type of thing FLI is excellent at championing. I could imagine Scott Alexander successfully doing this as well.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>A serious deep dive into the long list of allegations of misconduct by Sam at OpenAI&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/11/22/sam-altman-fired-y-combinator-paul-graham/\"><u>and elsewhere</u></a> to write up and publish. Something like the recent Nonlinear post\u2013but focused at Sam\u2013would likely have far, far higher EV. Alternatively, a donor could hire a professional firm to do this. (If someone is interested in funding this but is low on time, please DM me, I\u2019d be happy to manage such a project.)</li><li>Capital \u201cP\u201d political pressure. AI safety advocates might consider nudging various actors in government to subject OpenAI and Microsoft to more scrutiny. Given the existing distrust of OpenAI and similar firms in DC, it might not take much to do this. With OpenAI\u2019s sudden and shocking purge of its oversight mechanism, it makes sense to potentially bring in some new eyes that are not as easily removed by malfeasance.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxzosgyid3rc\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxzosgyid3rc\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</li><li>Interpersonal social pressure.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/24172377-letter-to-the-openai-board\"><u>Here is the list</u></a> of OpenAI signatories who demanded the board step down\u2013while threatening to gut and destroy OpenAI\u2013without waiting to learn the reason for the board\u2019s actions. If the CEO of ExxonMobil had an undisclosed conflict with the company\u2019s internal environmental oversight board, and I had a friend who publicly threatened to resign if the environmental board was not fired\u2013while not knowing the reason for the conflict\u2013it would badly undermine my confidence in the morality of my friend. I know many people at OpenAI who signed this letter, and though it is awkward, I intend to have a gentle but probing conversation with each of them. Much like with advocacy, I don\u2019t intend to push hard enough to harm our long-term relationship. Social pressure is one of the most powerful tools civil society actors can yield.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>AI safety advocates are good at hugboxing. We should lean into this strength and continue to prioritize hugboxing. But we can\u2019t only hugbox. This is too important to get right for us to hide in our comfort zone while more skilled, serious political actors take over the space and purge AI safety mechanisms and advocates.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnyh8jw8lhcfq\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefyh8jw8lhcfq\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>My job involves serving as a friendly face of AI safety.

Antenatal care (ANC), which includes all kinds of health services for pregnant women, plays an essential role in reducing neonatal mortality, yet many pregnant women do not attend ANC or start attending too late in their pregnancy in order to receive appropriate care. Two barriers to attending are women not knowing they are pregnant until they are already far along in their pregnancy, and not being aware about the importance and benefits of ANC.&nbsp;</p><p>To overcome these two barriers, the intervention in this report focuses on dispensing free urine pregnancy tests (UPTs) at the community level so that women who suspect they are pregnant are able to confirm their pregnancy. The intervention is paired with counseling on when and how to use UPTs, the importance and benefits of (early and frequent) ANC attendance, as well as how and where ANC can be accessed so women are more likely to use these tests and have their first ANC visit in their first trimester once they confirmed their pregnancy.</p><p>The evidence base for this intervention is very weak and it is unclear whether in practice this intervention would have any impact. There are no studies looking at the effect of UPT provision on earlier ANC initiation, nor is there reliable and positive&nbsp; evidence on the effect on CHWs\u2019 counseling on earlier ANC initiation. Additionally, we remain quite uncertain about many of the assumptions we made in our theory of change. The only causal link which we are certain about is the one between higher ANC attendance and decreased risk in neonatal mortality\u2014however, this relies on the quality of provided ANC, which is fairly low in many countries.</p><p>Our cost-effectiveness model of a hypothetical five-year program in India comes up with an estimate of 98.30$/DALY<strong>&nbsp;</strong>(lower/upper bound: 11.80\u2013819.60$), with 38,530 averted DALYs in total (lower/upper bound: 3,228\u2013459,941). Although our modeled intervention meets GiveWell\u2019s cost-effectiveness bar of 100$ per averted DALY, we think our CEA is very speculative given that it is based on many estimates and imperfect proxies which we are very uncertain about.</p><p>Overall, we conclude this is a potentially cost-effective intervention but has extremely little evidence, thus we do not recommend this intervention to be used for founding a new charity.</p><h1>1 &nbsp; &nbsp; Background</h1><h2>1.1 &nbsp; Burden of disease</h2><p>Neonatal mortality continues to present a critical challenge in public health, particularly in low- and lower-middle-income countries.

They include maternal and fetal assessment (e.g., screening for potential health conditions), nutritional interventions (e.g., iron and folic acid supplements), and counseling on the birth as well as postpartum period (<a href=\"https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/250796/9789241549912-eng.pdf?sequence=1\"><u>WHO, 2016</u></a>). Beyond that, ANC can be used as the basis for further interventions benefitting child health, such as immunizations, nutrition programs, and breastfeeding counseling, and testing for and treating communicable and non-communicable diseases that may threaten the unborn child (<a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/7/11/e017122.full.pdf\"><u>Kuhnt &amp; Vollmer, 2017</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the importance of ANC for the child, availability and uptake in LMICs is still less than optimal. While the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/07-11-2016-new-guidelines-on-antenatal-care-for-a-positive-pregnancy-experience\"><u>WHO (2016)</u></a> recommends pregnant women receiving ANC at least four\u2014and ideally eight\u2014ANC visits, in LMICs, only around 64% of pregnant women attend the recommended four or more ANC visits (<a href=\"https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators/indicator-details/GHO/antenatal-care-coverage-at-least-four-visits\"><u>WHO, 2023</u></a>).</p><h2>1.3 &nbsp; Antenatal care in the first trimester</h2><p>Antenatal care is especially important for women to start in their first trimester and recommended by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/07-11-2016-new-guidelines-on-antenatal-care-for-a-positive-pregnancy-experience\"><u>WHO (2016)</u></a>. Studies have shown that early ANC initiation, preferably within the first trimester, is associated with better neonatal outcomes, including reduced risks of preterm births and low birth weight (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/46/5/1668/3960260\"><u>Doku &amp; Neupane, 2017</u></a>). This is because timely ANC initiation is crucial for early detection and treatment of complications which might have detrimental effects on maternal and fetus health (<a href=\"https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-020-2738-0\"><u>Manyeh et al., 2020</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2490-5#:~:text=The%201st%20ANC%20timing%20to,38%20weeks%20of%20gestational%20age.\"><u>Gebresilassie et al., 2019</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the benefits of early ANC initiation, many pregnant women do not have their first ANC visit until their second or even third trimester. An analysis with data from The Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) for 36 Sub-Sahara African countries found that overall timely initiation of ANC visits (i.e., within the first trimester of pregnancy) was only 38%, ranging from 14.5% in Mozambique to 68.6% in Liberia (<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0262411\"><u>Alem et al., 2022</u></a>). This means most women in these countries do not get into the system until quite late, and cannot fully benefit from preventative and curative services before giving birth.</p><h1>2 &nbsp; &nbsp; Theory of change</h1><h2>2.1 &nbsp; Scope of the intervention</h2><p>While scoping this intervention we conducted a barrier analysis on ANC utilization in LICs and LMICs. The analysis is presented in section 3.1.1 and shows that women being uncertain about whether or not they are pregnant affects timely ANC initiation. We reasoned that, since ANC follows a schedule<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefhe3euf0gui5\"><sup><a href=\"#fnhe3euf0gui5\">[1]</a></sup></span>, it is likely that this also affects the total number of ANC visits made by women (since women essentially \u2018miss\u2019 their first trimester visit(s)) and logically contributes to the fact that women in LICs and LMICs do not meet the WHO recommended number of visits. Such late and low utilization of ANC in turn affects neonatal mortality. Ultimately, earlier and more frequent ANC visits should result in diagnosing and treating more conditions related to women\u2019s pregnancy, leading to a reduction in neonatal mortality.&nbsp;</p><p>This intervention focuses on<strong> dispensing urine pregnancy tests</strong>&nbsp;<strong>and providing counseling on when and how to use UPTs, the importance and benefits of (early and frequent) ANC attendance, as well as how and where ANC can be accessed</strong>. The intermediate outcome of the intervention is to increase ANC initiation within the first trimester and, therefore, also the total number of ANC visits made by&nbsp; pregnant women in LMICs. By increasing ANC utilization, the intervention ultimately aims to reduce neonatal deaths.</p><p>The implementation of this intervention involves procuring and distributing UPTs to CHWs, who then spread the word that they have UPTs (perhaps framed as \u201cquick non-invasive tests that can tell if a woman is pregnant\u201d) and that these tests are available for free to women interested in using them (with some kind of limit e.g one test per woman and, potentially, with some kind of information on signs of pregnancy). Following this, we assume that women reach out to CHWs if they wish to use these tests and suspect they are pregnant. We have one RCT supporting this model (see section 3.1.2). Additionally, as mentioned, CHWs inform women who receive a test on the use of the test, the importance of ANC, and how they can go about accessing ANC. This allows women to confirm their pregnancy earlier, access ANC earlier, and, potentially, have more ANC visits. It also educates them on the importance of ANC, tackling a subset of barriers and misconceptions around ANC outlined in section 3.1.1 (e.g. one barrier is women believing that ANC is only required when they have health issues or pregnancy complications).&nbsp;</p><p>We are uncertain about whether this is the best way to increase early ANC utilization and early ANC utilization in general, because our intervention only targets potentially pregnant women who may or may not be able to make independent health decisions without the support of their families and communities. We briefly considered radio campaigns as another type of intervention that could improve ANC utilization, and think the potential impact of such an intervention deserves research. However, we chose to continue our study of urine pregnancy test dispensation, since we believe the idea showed sufficient promisingness to warrant in-depth research<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxksio0qpu99\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxksio0qpu99\">[2]</a></sup></span>.</p><p>In addition to this, our version of the intervention initially targeted both neonatal and maternal mortality. However, while we found enough evidence on the importance of ANC and neonatal survival in our evidence review, we found limited evidence on the link between ANC and maternal deaths (see section 3.2). Hence, we chose to only focus on neonatal mortality. This is reflected in the theory of change, geographic assessment, and&nbsp; cost-effectiveness analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>2.2 &nbsp; Causal chain<br><br><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FxTi2oMjKiqDdv37P/uo6iaapr7dyv68qbhrzv\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FxTi2oMjKiqDdv37P/gfngb0clghbxvckjqvyh 270w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FxTi2oMjKiqDdv37P/ohvpv2itfgnwjwkmbyl6 540w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FxTi2oMjKiqDdv37P/uqy7gngmv1insg6agevc 810w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FxTi2oMjKiqDdv37P/iz2rpgqp35l9xz6bkyol 1080w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FxTi2oMjKiqDdv37P/i8t7fbuh9uiwlgmustai 1350w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FxTi2oMjKiqDdv37P/jgwmnxaqljqemthzvlcd 1620w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FxTi2oMjKiqDdv37P/drssibyowibeuykjvtqu 1890w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FxTi2oMjKiqDdv37P/p1j5pllpmkvspy5qcm0i 2160w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FxTi2oMjKiqDdv37P/thm3tef2rewkkz8ti7g9 2430w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/FxTi2oMjKiqDdv37P/yiclolxqrpnc1qj9dtev 2608w\"></h2><p>Possible externalities of this intervention:</p><ul><li>Increase in ANC attendance can not only reduce neonatal mortality but also reduce the risk of other neonatal conditions that do not lead to death.</li><li>Having access to free UPTs and confirming their pregnancy can enable women to access abortion services earlier, thus preventing women finding out about their pregnancy once it is too late for an abortion (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8549136/\"><u>Somefun et al., 2021</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25276550/\"><u>Andersen et al., 2013</u></a>).</li></ul><p>We haven\u2019t explored these externalities in detail. However, it seems unlikely that ANC&nbsp;<i>increases</i> risk of neonatal conditions that do not lead to death. We therefore believe that this externality would positively update our conclusion on this intervention.&nbsp; However, we are uncertain if increase in abortions due to increased and earlier confirmation of pregnancy would result in a net positive. Whether or not abortions result in positive or negative outcomes would, amongst other considerations, depend on the quality of abortion services availed by women, which we have not looked into.</p><h2>2.3 &nbsp; Outlining assumptions and levels of uncertainty</h2><p>Our theory of change consists of several assumptions, some of which we are uncertain about. Our certainty levels for each assumption is indicated by color coding and depends on the evidence we have and our reasoning for each step (green indicates we are confident it is true, orange indicates that we think it is likely to be true, and red indicates that we are highly uncertain that it is true). These uncertainties are then further discussed and evaluated in our evidence review. The color coding of these assumptions reflects our level of uncertainty after having conducted the evidence review.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Uncertainty 1 (low): </strong>There are countries with a need for this intervention where a network of CHWs exists and it is logistically possible for staff to provide training for CHWs.&nbsp;</p><p>Our evidence review suggests that pregnancy confirmation is a barrier to ANC initiation and utilization in several countries studied (see section 3.1.1) and our geographic assessment finds several countries where CHWs are present (see section 5). Additionally, our evidence review also discusses related interventions in several countries that have involved training CHWs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Uncertainty 2 (medium): </strong>The charity (or partner organizations) can procedure and distribute UPTs to CHWs on a continuous basis.&nbsp;</p><p>CHWs will be unable to provide potentially pregnant women with UPTs if they do not have a constant supply available to distribute. Generally, UPTs are very low-tech and seem to be very low-cost, so we expect that procurement might not be a major issue. However, distributing them to CHWs is likely to be a complex logistical challenge if the charity (or partner organizations) take care of last-mile delivery\u2014or CHWs\u2019 workload would increase if they have to get UPTs themselves from larger health centers which the tests are supplied to.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Uncertainty 3 (medium):</strong> CHWs successfully spread the word about the availability of free UPTs and women reach out to the CHWs operating in their communities.&nbsp;</p><p>We assume that CHWs spread the word that they now have UPTs (potentially framed as \u201cquick non-invasive tests that can tell if a woman is pregnant\u201d) and that these tests are available to women interested in using them, for free (with some kind of limit e.g one test per woman and, potentially, with some kind of information on signs of pregnancy). Following this, we assume that women reach out to CHWs if they wish to use these tests and suspect they are pregnant.&nbsp;</p><p>We have one RCT supporting this model (see section 3.1.2) and the model seems consistent with how CHWs provision to other medical products (like iron tablets and contraception) in the country chosen for our cost-effectiveness analysis (see section 6).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Uncertainty 4 (medium): </strong>CHWs have the ability and time to follow through on their assigned tasks.&nbsp;</p><p>In many countries, CHWs already perform a range of different healthcare activities around maternal care, which makes us fairly certain about CHWs\u2019 ability to carry out the tasks relating to this intervention.</p><p>We are less certain about CHWs\u2019 available time to follow through on their assigned task. We reviewed evidence suggesting that increasing CHWs workload does not necessarily come at the expense of other essential activities (see section 3.3). However, the degree to which CHWs are overworked and being faced with competing priorities could vary from country to country.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Uncertainty 5 (low):</strong> Women do not already have access to free UPTs.&nbsp;</p><p>Providing UPTs will have less effect on timely ANC uptake if many women already have access to (free) pregnancy tests. According to the literature reviewed in section 3.3, availability and costs both seem to be barriers to accessing pregnancy tests in several countries in Asia and Africa, and they are often not available at the basic primary healthcare level.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Uncertainty 6 (medium):</strong> Women are willing to use the UPT they receive (once the CHWs inform them on how to use them) and they trust the result.</p><p>Even though UPTs are provided for free, some women might choose not to use them. In order for the intervention to have an impact, UPT use would need to be high enough. Secondly, even if the women are willing to use UPTs, they may not know how to do so. However, the intervention is partly addressing women\u2019s possible lack of knowledge on how to use UPTs since the intervention involves CHWs providing instructions on UPT use.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Uncertainty 7 (medium-high):</strong> Earlier pregnancy confirmation and receiving counseling on ANC leads to early ANC initiation.&nbsp;</p><p>Women\u2019s inability to confirm their pregnancy is one of many barriers to early ANC initiation (see section 3.1.1). Therefore lowering this barrier is likely to increase ANC initiation. However, we are unsure what the extent of this increase would be, since we do not know how it compares to the scale of other barriers to early ANC initiation (also discussed in section 3.1.1). We are also unsure if ANC initiation would be the dominant result of pregnancy confirmation: some women may choose to get an abortion and not attend ANC. Finally, we have no evidence that directly looks at the relationship between pregnancy confirmation and ANC initiation.&nbsp;</p><p>Lack of knowledge about the availability and importance of ANC is also one of many barriers to (early) ANC attendance (see section 3.1.1). Many women may not know ANC exists, which benefits it can provide, and that ANC is recommended even in the absence of pregnancy complications. However, the evidence we find on the effect of CHWs\u2019 counseling on ANC uptake is very weak, which is why we remain very uncertain about this assumption.</p><p><strong>Uncertainty 8 (medium):</strong> Women who have their first ANC visit earlier in their pregnancy are able to attend more ANC visits than they would if they had their first ANC visit later.</p><p>While there are a range of barriers to accessing ANC and women can choose to no longer attend ANC after their first visit, it is plausible that early ANC initiation raises the number of visits on the margin (e.g. at least women who were going to avail ANC&nbsp; anyways, end up availing more ANC visits since they do not miss the first visit on the ANC schedule).&nbsp;</p><p>Studies have shown that early ANC initiation, preferably within the first trimester, is associated with better neonatal outcomes, including reduced risks of preterm births and low birth weight and that early ANC initiation is crucial for early detection and treatment of complications which might have detrimental effects on maternal and fetus health. This is discussed in section 1.3. This association also suggests that early ANC visits also result in more ANC visits.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Uncertainty 9 (medium):</strong> Earlier and more frequent ANC visits result in the diagnosis and treatment of more conditions related to women\u2019s pregnancy.</p><p>This depends on the quality of ANC available to the beneficiaries of the intervention, since the intervention does not deal with the supply side of ANC. More specifically, it depends on there being at least one country in the intersection of having high quality enough ANC care but low use and/or late initiation of ANC. Initially, we assumed that the correlation between ANC quality and utilization would be high and were uncertain if such a country exists. However, our geographic weighted factor model (section 5) includes variables on ANC quality and ANC utilization and the correlation between these two variables is 0.7 (for ANC quality and ANC visits being greater or equal to four) and 0.26 (for ANC quality and first trimester visits). We think that this suggests that it is likely that there are some countries at this intersection.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Uncertainty 10 (low):</strong> Diagnosis and treatment of conditions related to women\u2019s pregnancy result in a reduction in neonatal mortality.&nbsp;</p><p>Given that there is correct diagnosis and treatment of conditions related to women\u2019s pregnancy (i.e. conditional on the uncertainty above), diagnosis and treatment of preventable conditions and risk factors of neonatal mortality would logically result in lower neonatal mortality.&nbsp;</p><h1>3&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Quality of evidence</h1><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wpr4LzXwOkvM9ydl5RdcXtlg-98FtamM2V4v4oyMaFU/edit?usp=share_link\"><u>Link to the spreadsheet</u></a></p><p>Our evidence review is divided into three parts. First, we conduct a barrier analysis to identify factors that prevent timely ANC initiation and ANC utilization and provide an overview of the evidence on whether the availability of UPTs and counseling by CHWs increase ANC initiation and ANC utilization (section 3.1). Following this, we review experimental and medical literature linking ANC to neonatal mortality and maternal mortality (section 3.2). Lastly, we discuss evidence around the remaining uncertainties outlined in our theory of change (section 3.3).&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, the evidence base for this intervention is very weak and it is unclear whether in practice this intervention would have any impact. There are no studies looking at the effect of UPT provision on earlier ANC initiation, nor is there reliable and positive&nbsp; evidence on the effect on CHWs\u2019 counseling on earlier ANC initiation. We are also very uncertain that this intervention would have any effect on maternal deaths. The only causal link which we are certain about is the one between higher ANC attendance and decreased risk in neonatal mortality\u2014however, this relies on the quality of provided ANC, which is fairly low in many countries.</p><p>Additionally, we remain quite uncertain about many of the assumptions we made in our theory of change. This includes fundamental assumptions of this intervention, such as whether the charity would be able to tackle the logistics of distributing UPTs to CHWs on a continuous basis, whether women would be willing to use the provided UPTs and trust the results, and whether the quality of ANC is of high enough quality to actually include the necessary check-ups and treatments to lower the risk of neonatal mortality. We expect that with more time, we would have been able to review more, and more relevant studies on some of these assumptions in order to become more certain about our conclusions.</p><h2>3.1 &nbsp; Evidence that a charity can make change in this space</h2><h3><strong>3.1.1 &nbsp; Barriers to early ANC initiation and ANC attendance</strong></h3><p>We found several studies examining the factors behind delayed ANC access and its underutilization/late utilization in LICs and LMICs. Our focus was particularly on the relationship between women\u2019s awareness of the significance of ANC, knowledge of pregnancy status, and delayed or infrequent ANC use.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on our brief analysis, we found that four of eight qualitative studies pinpointed pregnancy confirmation as a barrier to ANC utilization (this includes one of two systematic reviews included in the eight qualitative studies). And two out of five mixed-methods studies pinpointed pregnancy confirmation as a barrier to ANC utilization (this includes one of three systematic reviews included in the five mixed-methods studies). Additionally, six out of eight qualitative studies (including both systematic reviews) and four out of five mixed-methods studies (including two out of three systematic reviews) noted lack of knowledge about ANC as a barrier. Neither of the two quantitative studies we reviewed mentioned pregnancy confirmation or lack of knowledge about ANC as a factor, but this is expected since they rely on survey data which might not include pregnancy confirmation as a factor/question.&nbsp;</p><p>Outside of this, the studies we reviewed mentioned several other factors associated with late and reduced ANC utilization. These primarily included economic constraints, transportation and distance to health facilities, lack of support from women\u2019s spouses or other family members, and poor quality of ANC.&nbsp;</p><p>A summary of the studies included in our analysis is presented in the table below (more information about each study can be found in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wpr4LzXwOkvM9ydl5RdcXtlg-98FtamM2V4v4oyMaFU/edit#gid=861188536\"><u>evidence review spreadsheet</u></a>). It is worth noting that, we haven't looked at the quality of each study or the controls it used in detail, nor whether studies overlap in systematic reviews. It is also worth noting that, although many of the studies we reviewed in fact mention lack of pregnancy awareness and lack of knowledge about ANC to be a barrier to (timely) ANC attendance, they are not reliable evidence that counseling and dispensing pregnancy tests can effectively increase ANC attendance.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt\"><p>Reference</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt\"><p>Methodology</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt\"><p>Study outcome/ focus</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt\"><p>Barriers include lack of pregnancy awareness</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt\"><p>Barriers include lack of knowledge about ANC</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" colspan=\"5\"><i>Qualitative studies and systematic reviews of qualitative studies</i></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7344902/\"><u>Dahab &amp;

It therefore is likely that lowering these barriers will increase earlier ANC initiation. However, we are unsure what the extent of this increase would be, since we do not know how it compares to the other barriers. This means we will look at experimental evidence for this in section 3.1.2 and 3.1.3.</p><h3><strong>3.1.2 &nbsp; Influence of urine pregnancy tests on ANC initiation and attendance</strong></h3><p>While lack of pregnancy awareness can be a barrier to initiating ANC in the first trimester, evidence of UPTs increasing ANC utilization is extremely limited. We found only two studies that involved distributing UPTs to CHWs, only one of which was a randomized control trial. Additionally, we found one study that looked at whether women who obtain UPTs on their own record present for ANC earlier.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Study 1:&nbsp;</strong>a RCT conducted in eastern Madagascar provided free pregnancy tests to CHWs who were offering reproductive services in the region (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article/34/8/566/5549447\"><u>Comfort et al., 2019</u></a>). The study randomized 622 community health workers into two groups<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqi94wkm74v\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqi94wkm74v\">[11]</a></sup></span>. In the intervention group, CHWs received a supply of UPTs and used word of mouth to let their community know about the availability of free UPTs.</p><p>The study found that CHWs in the intervention group provided services to 50% more women (6.3 vs 4.2 women), that more women knew they were pregnant at the end of their visit to the CHW (95% vs 10% women), and that a higher number of clients received ANC at the visit (67% vs 28%)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref4pf25ppiwbs\"><sup><a href=\"#fn4pf25ppiwbs\">[12]</a></sup></span>. All three results were statistically significant at p &lt; 0.01 or p &lt; 0.001. However, the study does not analyze whether ANC utilization increased after this visit to the CHWs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Study 2:&nbsp;</strong>A second study in Nepal involved a similar intervention and studied the link between providing CHWs with UPTs on referrals to reproductive health services (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25276550/\"><u>Andersen et al., 2013</u></a>). The study involved training 1,683 CHWs, 89% of which provided follow-up data at eight months. Of these, 80% reported providing UPTs to women during the follow-up period, with 3.1 UPTs dispensed per CHW on average. 53% women tested positive for pregnancy and the CHWs referred 32% of them to safe abortion services and 68% to ANC. However, the study did not provide baseline values. It is therefore not informative on whether providing UPTs to CHWs&nbsp;<i>increased</i> pregnancy confirmation or referrals to reproductive health services.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Study 3:&nbsp;</strong>A third study was an observational study that analyzed cross-sectional data on 158 women presenting for ANC and 164 women presenting for abortion in Cape Town, South Africa (<a href=\"https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2393-6-26\"><u>Morroni &amp; Moodley, 2006</u></a>). It found that women who obtained UPTs of their own record presented for ANC earlier, while women who were sent from public health clinics to buy and use a UPT presented for ANC later. However, the control group was not clearly specified and there could be enough confounding factors at play to draw a sound conclusion from this paper.&nbsp;</p><p>In summary, given the methodological issues with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25276550/\"><u>Andersen et al. (2013)</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2393-6-26\"><u>Morroni &amp; Moodley (2006)</u></a>, we can only draw conclusions from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article/34/8/566/5549447\"><u>Comfort et al. (2019)</u></a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25276550/\"><u>Andersen et al. (2013)</u></a> suggest that pregnancy confirmation through UPTs&nbsp;<i>can</i> change intermediary outcomes like client care-seeking behavior and services offered by the CHW. However, we are unsure of whether these results generalize to different contexts. We also cannot conclude that distributing UPTs leads to increased ANC attendance, since the study did not look at this particular outcome measure.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3.1.3 &nbsp; The role of CHWs in increasing early ANC initiation and ANC attendance&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>While one part of this intervention consists of CHWs dispensing UPTs to potentially pregnant women, the other part consists of CHWs providing counseling on the importance and benefits of (early and frequent) ANC attendance as well as in which health facilities ANC can be accessed. This should increase the likelihood of women attending ANC earlier if they confirm their pregnancy with the UPT they receive.</p><p>Our intervention is based on CHWs spreading information about free UPTs within their communities and women coming to see them in their clinics to obtain a test. However, almost all of the evidence we found on the effect of CHW counseling on behavior change, specifically on (earlier) ANC attendance, focuses on home visits made by CHWs. This approach is different to the one used in our intervention and thus the studies reviewed below are only of limited generalizability. Another limitation of the evidence is that all the studies we reviewed look at CHWs counseling pregnant women on ANC, not&nbsp;<i>potentially</i> pregnant women like it would be the case in our intervention.&nbsp;</p><p>The methodologically strongest study is a meta-analysis of 34 studies; however, the study&nbsp; pooled results from very different kinds of interventions (the shared denominator being community-based interventions to improve ANC uptake). It did not find significant results in terms of increased or earlier ANC attendance (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26621223/\"><u>Mbuagbaw et al., 2015</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Next, the RCTs we reviewed return mixed results:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://gh.bmj.com/content/8/3/e011071.info\"><u>Kayentao et al.

(2019</u></a>) do not find significant results in terms of increased or earlier ANC attendance.</li></ul><p>The two weaker studies (in terms of methodology, with one being an observational study and the other one a difference-in-difference study) report more favorable evidence on CHW counseling:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5992715/\"><u>Hijazi et al.

(2022</u></a>) find that counseling by CHWs resulted in a significantly increased likelihood of attending four or more ANC visits but found no increase in the likelihood of early ANC attendance.</li></ul><p>Overall, the results are inconclusive. Considering the very limited generalizability of these studies, we interpret the evidence above as extremely weak evidence for CHWs counseling to increase the frequency of ANC visits, and do not regard it as evidence for CHWs\u2019 counseling to increase ANC attendance in women\u2019s first trimester.</p><h2>3.2 &nbsp; Evidence that the change has the expected effects</h2><h3><strong>3.2.1 &nbsp; Influence of (early) ANC on neonatal and maternal mortality according to field literature&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>In general, we found limited evidence on whether or not ANC reduces risks of maternal mortality.

The review included four trials from HICs and three trials from LICs and found that reduced ANC visits negatively affected perinatal mortality (which was an outcome variable for five trials and was driven by results of trials in LMICs and LICs) but did not significantly affect maternal death (which was a variable for three trials, RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.50 to 2.57).

Additionally, the risk was 32% lower for women who met one of these two WHO recommendations. However, ANC attendance was not associated with lower risk in the Middle East and North Africa.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Study 6:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07853890.2023.2197294\"><u>Saaka et al.

We found sufficient evidence to suggest that ANC visits reduce neonatal mortality and evidence suggesting that early ANC initiation along with number and quality of ANC reduces neonatal mortality. While&nbsp;<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/ije/article/46/5/1668/3960260\"><u>Doku &amp; Neupane (2017)</u></a> mention the effects of first trimester visits, it does so in conjunction with the number of visits.

We believe that such evidence would be directionally the same for neonatal mortality given the type and sample size of the studies we came across and reviewed but we are unsure of what such evidence would mean for the association between ANC and maternal mortality.</p><h3><strong>3.2.2 &nbsp; Influence of (early) ANC on neonatal and maternal mortality according to the medical literature&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>In addition to the field literature on the influence of (early) ANC attendance on neonatal and maternal mortality in LMICs, we also reviewed medical literature to get a better sense of what causes of neonatal and maternal mortality can be addressed during ANC, and especially during ANC in the first trimester.</p><p>According to medical literature, infections and prematurity are two of the leading causes of neonatal death, each accounting for more than a quarter of neonatal deaths (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9781437701340/averys-diseases-of-the-newborn\"><u>Wright, 2012</u></a>):</p><ul><li>Infections: STIs can be transferred from mother to child in utero (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK222108/\"><u>Bale et al., 2003</u></a>), but can be prevented by medication during pregnancy (<a href=\"https://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/health/conditions-and-diseases/staying-healthy-during-pregnancy/medical-conditions-and-pregnancy#:~:text=High%20blood%20pressure%20during%20pregnancy,in%20the%20mother%20and%20fetus.\"><u>John Hopkins Medicine, n.d.</u></a>). For example, syphilis can be easily treated with antibiotics, but ideally as early as possible in a woman\u2019s pregnancy to reduce the risk of mother-to-child transmission (<a href=\"https://9475dbf4-555e-4808-9886-5f8ee815cc82.usrfiles.com/ugd/9475db_42390ced9d414780b55c9ccd686489a1.pdf\"><u>Mur\u00e1r, 2023</u></a>). UTIs, if untreated, can lead to pyelonephritis, which can cause preterm delivery (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK222108/\"><u>Bale et al., 2003</u></a>). Tetanus is another risk factor for neonatal death, and mothers can be immunized against tetanus during pregnancy (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK222108/\"><u>Bale et al., 2003</u></a>).</li><li>Preterm birth: Prematurity can be caused by hypertension (<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/preterm-birth#:~:text=Causes%20include%20multiple%20pregnancies%2C%20infections,also%20be%20a%20genetic%20influence.\"><u>WHO, 2023</u></a>). Incidentally, hypertension is also one of the leading causes of maternal death (<a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X(14)70227-X/fulltext\"><u>Say et al., 2014</u></a>). Hypertension requires close monitoring during the pregnancy and women are recommended to start taking drugs, ideally at the end of their first trimester, in order to reduce the risk of prematurity (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8542489/\"><u>Beech &amp; Mangos, 2021</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/ng133/resources/hypertension-in-pregnancy-diagnosis-and-management-pdf-66141717671365\"><u>National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2019</u></a>).&nbsp;</li></ul><p>We also interviewed Sophia Seidler (a fellow RTP participant and pediatrician at the University Medical Center Goettingen since 2020) on the causes of maternal and neonatal mortality as well as potential treatments during ANC. She emphasized that early ANC allows for crucial counseling on avoiding toxic substances like alcohol and tobacco (which is associated with higher risks of preterm birth, which in turn is a major reason for neonatal mortality (<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14718217/\"><u>Albertsen et al., 2004</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8760711/\"><u>Wisborg et al., 1996</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/book/9781437701340/averys-diseases-of-the-newborn\"><u>Wright, 2012</u></a>). This type of counseling can easily be incorporated into ANC programs in low-income countries as it requires no special medical equipment. Another benefit is timely nutritional counseling, specifically regarding folic acid and iron, and, relatedly, the provision of supplements. Lack of folic acid increases the risk for disabilities in children, such as open backs, which in turn increases the risk of infection and neonatal death. Iron deficiency can also increase the risk of maternal mortality, particularly in cases of blood loss at birth (anemia accounts for 9% of maternal deaths (<a href=\"https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-021-03920-4#:~:text=According%20to%20WHO%2C%20more%20than,status%20of%20women%2C%20and%20illiteracy.\"><u>Sitaula et al., 2021</u></a>)).&nbsp;</p><p>All of the above primarily address neonatal mortality, not maternal mortality. Given that in the literature we reviewed in section 3.2.1 we also could not find any effects of ANC on the risks of maternal mortality, we decided to exclude maternal mortality from the scope of this intervention, and will thus also exclude it from our GWFM and CEA.</p><p>One caveat for the reviewed medical evidence is that the discussed methods for diagnosing and treating causes of neonatal and maternal mortality might not be broadly available in LMICs given the generally lower quality of healthcare in many countries. The question of ANC quality is further discussed in section 3.3.</p><h2>3.3 &nbsp; Evidence on other key uncertainties</h2><h3><strong>3.3.1 &nbsp; The charity (or partner organization) can procure and distribute UPTs to CHWS on a continuous basis</strong></h3><p>As for the procurement of UPTs, we weren\u2019t completely able to confirm continuous availability of UPTs on the LIMC market. However,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.arizton.com/market-reports/pregnancy-test-kits-market\"><u>Arizton (2023)</u></a> writes that \u201cthe global pregnancy test kits market is highly competitive and has many global, regional, and domestic players offering a comprehensive product portfolio of pregnancy test kits\u201d. This and the fact that pregnancy tests are quite low-tech and cheap\u2014the median price per unit is less than $0.10 (<a href=\"https://mshpriceguide.org/en/single-drug-information/?%20DMFId=654&amp;searchYear=2015\"><u>International Medical Products Price Guide, 2015</u></a>)\u2014makes us quite confident that pregnancy tests are generally available in LMICs for a charity or its partners to buy in bulk and dispense to CHWs. If they are not continuously available in LMICs, an organization could buy pregnancy tests in HICs, where the supply is likely to be more stable, and provide them to CHWs in LMICs\u2014however, this would supposedly greatly increase (shipping) costs.&nbsp;</p><p>As for the distribution of UPTs to CHWs, we are uncertain how an organization may best distribute UPTs to each individual CHW. Ultimately, we think the logistical complexity of this intervention would greatly increase if the last-mile delivery of UPTs to CHWs was done by the organization itself. In contrast, if UPTs were delivered to a bigger health care facility where individual CHWs could pick them up, this would increase the workload of CHWs depending on how often they would need to travel to the health care facility to restock their supply of UPTs. It would be worthwhile to look into how CHWs usually get their material and equipment in order to better how to best handle these logistics.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3.3.2 &nbsp; CHWs successfully spread the word about the availability of free UPTs and women reach out to the CHWs operating in their communities</strong></h3><p>The pathway of women obtaining a UPT through CHWs is loosely based on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article/34/8/566/5549447\"><u>Comfort et al. (2019)</u></a>: women hear about the availability of free UPTs at their CHW\u2019s clinic and visit the CHW to obtain a test. Women who obtain a test might currently suspect they are pregnant or obtain a test for a future point in time at which they suspect they are pregnant. Crucially, the information about available pregnancy tests could also increase the women\u2019s saliency of pregnancy, leading them to more often suspect them to be pregnant. The (cost-)effectiveness of this intervention would partly depend on how well women can identify themselves as being at risk of pregnancy. The better able women are to correctly suspect they are pregnant, the fewer tests would be handed out. Given the lack of time to gather more evidence on this assumption, we remain uncertain about it.</p><h3><strong>3.3.3 &nbsp; CHWs have the ability and time to follow through on their assigned tasks</strong></h3><p>There are several pieces of evidence that make us fairly certain in CHWs\u2019 ability to provide services to women as prescribed by the intervention:</p><ul><li>There are several studies on interventions leveraging CHWs to provide services on antenatal care, postpartum care and contraception. Judging by these studies, it seems possible to successfully engage CHWs in large-scale interventions about ANC (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article/34/8/566/5549447\"><u>Comfort et al., 2019</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gh.bmj.com/content/8/3/e011071.info\"><u>Kayentao et al., 2023</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bmcpregnancychildbirth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12884-019-2714-8\"><u>Kachimanga et al., 2020</u></a>).&nbsp;</li><li>Madagascar has \u201ctask-shifted some of the provision of contraceptives to CHWs as a way to expand access to FP [family planning] among women in remote, rural areas\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010782415005867\"><u>Comfort et al., 2016</u></a>). We do not know whether this particular instance of&nbsp; task-shifting to CHWs has ever been evaluated. Nevertheless, we take the above as weak but positive evidence that CHWs would be able to successfully provide UPTs and counseling on ANC if they can do the same with contraception. We assume the government of Madagascar has a certain level of trust in the capabilities of CHWs or otherwise they would not have tasked them with the provision of contraceptives.</li><li>According to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://iris.who.int/bitstream/handle/10665/340717/9789241512022-eng.pdf?sequence=1\"><u>WHO (2020)</u></a>, CHWs often perform a variety of tasks, including delivering diagnostic, treatment or clinical care,&nbsp; encouraging uptake of health services, providing health education and behavior change motivation, data collection and record-keeping, improving relationships between health system functionaries and community members, and providing psychosocial support. We take this as additional weak evidence that CHWs are well-suited to conduct the tasks involved in this intervention.</li></ul><p>Another important aspect to consider is whether CHWs would have the capacity to deliver high-quality ANC counseling and UPT dispensation given their already existing workload. There are a few specific studies looking at CHWs\u2019 workload and the change in service quality if additional tasks are added to CHWs\u2019 duties. These studies have not been conducted in the realm of UPT dispensation or ANC, so they are of somewhat limited generalizability. Nevertheless, they find that increasing CHWs workload does not necessarily come at the expense of other essential activities. Instead, CHWs reduce their time spent on non-work activities, and the increased workload has effects on their domestic life<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefivs0x3fznjj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnivs0x3fznjj\">[15]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefrs586iu1mk7\"><sup><a href=\"#fnrs586iu1mk7\">[16]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefc4gljjfmp9v\"><sup><a href=\"#fnc4gljjfmp9v\">[17]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(<a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/156482651203300408\"><u>Puett et al., 2012</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bmchealthservres.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12913-022-08577-z\"><u>Chinkhumba et al., 2022</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10010520/\"><u>Astale et al., 2023</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>From the above we conclude that when implementing this intervention, making sure CHWs do not suffer from an increased workload is important. The scope of the service CHWs provide for this intervention is not only to dispense UPTs to women at risk of pregnancy but also to provide instructions on when and how to use UPTs as well as counseling on the importance of ANC. The extent of the counseling part on UPTs and ANC might thus be seen as a tradeoff between the amount of information women need to receive in order to maximize correct use of UPTs and uptake of ANC, and the amount of work added to CHWs existing responsibilities. Offloading last-mile delivery of UPTs to CHWs (as addressed in section 3.3.1) could also come at the expense of CHWs time and should be considered when implementing this intervention.</p><h3><strong>3.3.4 &nbsp; Women do not already have access to free UPTs</strong></h3><p>We are fairly certain that many women in LMICs do not have access to affordable pregnancy tests based on the following evidence:</p><p>Cost as a barrier:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article/34/8/566/5549447\"><u>Comfort et al.

While the trust in the test is something that could be addressed by the CHW while providing counseling, the lack of support from a woman\u2019s partner is not.

However, this relationship is not causal and it could likely be the case that the relationship is mediated by, for example, ease of access to ANC.</li></ul><p>However, as we found out in the barrier analysis (see section 3.1.1), women are faced with a number of hurdles when it comes to ANC, including quality of care, disrespect or abuse from health staff, distance to health facilities, and cost of ANC visits. Thus, it could be that after a woman\u2019s first visit in her first trimester, she decides to no longer continue with ANC based on the hurdles above. Overall, we conclude that an ANC visit in the first trimester is a necessary but insufficient condition to completing all four WHO-recommended ANC appointments.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3.3.7 &nbsp; The quality of care during ANC is sufficient to improve mothers\u2019 and children\u2019s health outcomes&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>If the quality of care women receive during their ANC visits fails to impact neonatal mortality, then trying to increase (early) ANC attendance is of little benefit.

MHI works in Ghana, a country which we identified as a potential target location for this intervention (see our geographic assessment in the next section). We posed the following questions:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Do women in Ghana usually have difficulties finding out whether they are pregnant or not? What\u2019s the use and availability of urine pregnancy tests?</li><li>To what extent is pregnancy confirmation a barrier to accessing antenatal care and how does it compare to other barriers such as high costs or low quality of antenatal care?</li><li>In your experience, when training healthcare workers to provide additional services, how has this affected healthcare staff\u2019s workload and service quality?</li></ol><p>Ben mentioned that he hadn\u2019t come across pregnancy detection as a barrier in his work in Ghana and that attendance of early ANC appointments tended to be low for cultural reasons (the pregnancy must be presented/recognised in the community before a woman will go to a health center for care). Outside of this, he was of the opinion that it would likely be feasible to train healthcare workers in tasks that place limited demands on their time and that pregnancy test delivery wouldn't cause service quality/workload issues.&nbsp;</p><p>These observations corroborated our conclusions from the evidence review. We chose not to reach out to or follow up with the other experts due to time constraints and because we don\u2019t expect expert views to substantially change the conclusions of this report.&nbsp;</p><h1>5 &nbsp; &nbsp; Geographic assessment</h1><h2>5.1 &nbsp; Geographic assessment</h2><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18UIt9T2ZZUpQptm38-z_tfYgnUEl28QwekfudOfCcuQ/edit?usp=share_link\">Link to the spreadsheet</a></p><p>We developed a geographic weight factor model (GWFM) to identify countries which would be well-suited for implementing this intervention.&nbsp;</p><p>Ideally, this intervention would be implemented in a country that fits the following criteria:</p><ul><li>High neonatal mortality</li><li>Low attendance of ANC and late ANC initiation (i.e., after the first trimester)</li><li>High number of women not being able to easily confirm their pregnancy</li><li>High number of women living in close distance to ANC units, being able to afford the (direct and indirect) costs of ANC, and not facing many other barriers to attending ANC (e.g., they get their family\u2019s approval or are able to make their own health decisions)</li><li>Sufficient quality of antenatal care services, including check-ups and treatments relevant for reducing neonatal mortality</li><li>High number of CHWs and ANC health staff&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Sufficient infrastructure and logistical capability to deliver UPTs to CHWs</li></ul><p>However, we did not find exact data for some of these criteria, which is why we used imperfect proxies.

We also included the Gender Inequality Index which acts as a proxy for how autonomous women are in their health decisions. Not being able to make independent decisions (and instead having to seek approval from their husband or mother-in-law) came up as a barrier to using UPTs (see section 3.3.5) and attending ANC (see section 3.1.1).</p><p>The number of active CHWs per 10,000 capita tells us more about if it is feasible to use CHWs as a pathway to dispense UPTs and information about ANC to pregnant women, and about the capacity of CHWs to handle the additional task on top of their existing workload (i.e., if there are few CHWs per 10,000 capita, CHWs are likely to be unable to address a large proportion of pregnant women and to be overwhelmed with their existing workload). The number of doctors as well as nurses/midwives per 10,000 capita should tell us about the overall capacity of the health care system to deal with the additional ANC attendance of pregnant women this intervention aims to generate. The number of doctors and nurses/midwives also serves as a kind of proxy for the quality and coverage of ANC. We also include direct data about ANC quality and coverage. These two factors are crucial, since aiming to increase pregnant women\u2019s ANC attendance adds little benefit if women cannot access ANC despite wanting to do so. Similarly, increasing pregnant women\u2019s attendance of ANC is not very valuable if the quality of ANC is low and fails to reduce neonatal mortality.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>5.1.3 &nbsp; Neglectedness (5%)</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Number of organizations</strong> already working to increase antenatal care utilization and/or early antenatal care utilization&nbsp;<strong>(5%)</strong></li></ul><p>Due to time constraints, neglectfulness was not reviewed.

In general, there are quite a few results about family planning programs, such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ippf.org/about-us/member-associations/lesotho\"><u>Lesotho Planned Parenthood Association</u></a>. While they are unlikely to implement the exact intervention we research in this report, it could be that they include aspects of it, such as offering pregnancy testing (since health care providers might want to rule out pregnancy before providing women with hormonal contraception).</p><p>We expect that spending more time on this and using different search strategies, such as talking to experts, might yield more results on this front. However, we could not find any existing organizations in the field related to our intervention, so we left the column for this factor blank in the GWFM spreadsheet.</p><h1>6 &nbsp; &nbsp; Cost-effectiveness analysis</h1><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AnHN9G3n20wK4DiJxUnhkbFJxxDYAy7MfekOM8gZKbI/edit?usp=share_link\">Link to the spreadsheet</a></p><p>We decided to model the cost-effectiveness for a hypothetical intervention in India because it was in the top countries according to our GWFM.

Each partner sub-center would receive training once a year. We assume the organization would scale linearly. Hence, we would hold training sessions at 20\u20131,600 sub-centers in the first year, twice as many in the second year, thrice as many in the third year, and so forth. The intervention would (potentially) impact the total women of reproductive age served by the partner sub-centers in any given year.&nbsp;</p><h2>6.1 &nbsp; Effects</h2><p>1. In order to model the effects of the intervention, we first estimated the number of women who could confirm whether or not they are pregnant without the intervention (counterfactual scenario) and the number of women who would be able to confirm whether or not they are pregnant with the intervention (intervention scenario). Thereby, we estimated the<strong> increase in women who could confirm&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>whether or not</strong></i><strong> they were pregnant due to the intervention.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>This was estimated using the results from a RCT in Madagascar (<a href=\"https://academic.oup.com/heapol/article/34/8/566/5549447\"><u>Comfort et al., 2019</u></a>) that found that providing CHWs with UPTs increased the number of women who sought out CWHs and the number of women who could confirm whether or not they were pregnant. The trial found that providing CHWs increased the number of women who sought out CHWs by 50% and increased the percentage of these women who knew whether or not they were pregnant by 86%<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmhjt2x2f4ac\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmhjt2x2f4ac\">[20]</a></sup></span>. For the baseline number of women seeking out CHWs in India, we used the number of women getting ANC counseling from CHWs as a very rough proxy for lack of a more accurate data source (National Family Health Survey results, as quoted by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8319567/\"><u>Nadella et al., 2021</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>2. Following the above, we calculated the&nbsp;<strong>number of women who could confirm whether or not they were pregnant&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>and</strong></i><strong> were actually pregnant</strong>, by using the national pregnancy rate (i.e. the ratio of the number of pregnant women to the number of women of reproductive age in India). We adjusted the ratio for both the counterfactual and the intervention scenario, assuming that the rate of pregnancy would be higher amongst the women that seek out CHWs. With this, we calculated the difference in the number of pregnant women who could confirm their pregnancy due to the intervention.&nbsp;</p><p>3. Since we did not have adequate studies to extract a possible effect of CHWs\u2019 counseling or UPT provision on ANC uptake, we used the national baseline rate of ANC access (40\u201349%, estimated from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5603717/\"><u>Mollar et al., 2017</u></a>; the data from this paper was also used in the GWFM). We thus calculated the&nbsp;<strong>additional number of women who would receive ANC&nbsp;</strong>by multiplying this baseline rate by the number of pregnant women who could confirm their pregnancy earlier due to the intervention. In other words, we assumed that in both scenarios, 40\u201349% of all women who access CHWs and find out they are pregnant would seek out ANC (in the case of India, visit the ANMs at the primary health sub-centers for ANC)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefgohkqipqmkp\"><sup><a href=\"#fngohkqipqmkp\">[21]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;</p><p>4. The consequent&nbsp;<strong>impact on neonatal mortality</strong> was estimated from an observational study that used DHS data from 1990 to 2013 to analyze nationally representative data of 69 LMICs and MICs (<a href=\"https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/7/11/e017122.full.pdf\"><u>Kuhnt &amp; Vollmer, 2017</u></a>). Based on the study, we assumed that one ANC visit reduced neonatal mortality by 33% and that four visits reduced it by 51%. The 33 to 51% range is similar to the conclusions reached by other papers in section 3.2.1 of our evidence review. These effect sizes do not quantify the impact of early ANC, only the impact of one additional appointment to four minimum appointments (one being the minimum amongst women who, by definition, access ANC and four being the number that meets the minimum recommended number of appointments by the WHO). Moreover, according to most papers we reviewed, the impact of four visits typically includes the impact of having been attended to by a \u2018skilled provider\u2019.&nbsp;</p><p>5. Finally, we<strong>&nbsp;converted the number of neonatal deaths averted to the number of averted DALYs </strong>by using 33 DALYs per neonatal death. This was the same weight assigned by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hOQf6Ug1WpoicMyFDGoqH7tmf3Njjc15Z1DGERaTbnI/edit\"><u>GiveWell (2020)</u></a> to neonatal deaths due to syphilis. We also calculated the impact of the program over time, assuming the linear scaling mentioned at the beginning of this section. However, we did not include a time discount in our analysis for the sake of simplicity and because we only modeled the intervention for a five-year horizon.&nbsp;</p><p>6. Due to the limited and weak evidence used to calculate effects, we discounted our estimated impact by applying three discounts: a generalizability discount, certainty discount, and bias discount. Our CEA is extremely sensitive to these discounts.&nbsp;</p><h2>6.2 &nbsp; Costs&nbsp;</h2><p>We included the following costs in our model:</p><ul><li><strong>The costs of UPTs include shipping, delivery and the monetary incentive provided to CHWs</strong> (the latter is standard practice in India, see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pib.gov.in/Pressreleaseshare.aspx?PRID=1606212\"><u>Government of India, 2020</u></a>). The per unit cost of UPTs and the per unit incentive to ASHA workers were extracted from two separate sources, while the per unit delivery cost was estimated using Fermi estimates. UPTs are fairly inexpensive. The major uncertainty here was the delivery costs. Given that UPTs will be delivered to rural health clinics, costs for this could vary given how easily reachable these clinics are.</li><li><strong>Costs of training of CHWs.</strong> The costs for training were estimated using Fermi estimation. The total cost was based on the number of trainers, the duration of the training and the number of training per year. All of these are estimates and can be adapted once the implementation of the intervention is planned in more detail.</li><li><strong>Organizational costs and counterfactual costs of employees.</strong> These were provided by CE RTP team and are held constant for all CEAs conducted by CE.</li></ul><p>Additionally, we assumed the cost for developing the training material would be in-house and included in organizational costs. We did not include the following costs due to time constraints: costs to beneficiaries, costs to government, opportunity costs of CHWs, discounts associated with government costs and costs borne by philanthropic actors.&nbsp;</p><h2>6.3 &nbsp; Results and key uncertainties&nbsp;</h2><p>Based on all of the above, our final estimates for the cost-effectiveness of this intervention in India is&nbsp;<strong>98.3$/DALY&nbsp;</strong>(lower bound: 11.79$/DALY; upper bound: 819.60$/DALY).&nbsp;</p><p>Although our modeled intervention meets GiveWell\u2019s cost-effectiveness bar of 100$ per averted DALY, we think our CEA is very speculative given that it is based on many estimates and imperfect proxies. The following factors&nbsp; could greatly change our cost-effectiveness estimate:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Our impact estimates do not affect neonatal/maternal health apart from reduced neonatal mortality. It also considered the monetary incentives provided to CHWs as costs while this can also be seen as an indirect benefit of income generation for CHWs who are women in the village. While we did not have time for a detailed sensitivity analysis, the point estimates in the CEA seem to be sensitive to these monetary benefits.&nbsp;</li><li>As mentioned in our evidence review, we were unable to find any study that directly estimated the impact of early pregnancy confirmation on ANC initiation and assumed that the baseline rate of health seeking behavior when it came to ANC remained the same. Our results were thus largely driven by the additional number of women who accessed CHWs and confirmed they were pregnant due to the intervention. These assumptions and estimates are somewhat arbitrary.</li><li>Our impact estimates also have 5-15% generalizability, bias and certainty discounts due to how context-specific this intervention is and the fact most intermediary outcomes are modeled based on one RCT. They do not include a time discount, for the sake of simplicity and because we only modeled the intervention for a 5 year horizon. Additionally, we have widened the confidence level on several of the point estimates used from studies we found in our evidence review, since&nbsp; we felt the results not be straightforwardly generalized.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>It is also highly dependent on the scale of the charity's operation. The above estimate assumes a linear expansion of 179 (lower/upper bound: 20, 1600) sub-centres per year. Reducing that to&nbsp; 77 (lower/upper bound: 20, 300) sub-centres reduces the cost-effectiveness to 141.61$/DALY (lower/upper bound: 24.7, 819.6).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h1>7 &nbsp; &nbsp; Conclusion</h1><p>In conclusion, we view dispensing UPTs to promote early ANC attendance as a&nbsp;<strong>low-evidenced but potentially cost-effective idea&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>do not recommend this intervention to be used for founding a new charity</strong>.</p><p>Our cost-effectiveness model of a hypothetical five-year program in India comes up with an estimate of 98.3$/DALY<strong>&nbsp;</strong>(lower/upper bound: 11.79\u2013819.60$), with 38,530 averted DALYs in total (lower/upper bound: 3228\u2013459,941). Although our modeled intervention meets GiveWell\u2019s cost-effectiveness bar of 100$ per averted DALY, we think our CEA is very speculative given that it is based on many estimates and imperfect proxies which we are very uncertain about.</p><p>The evidence base for this intervention is very weak and it is unclear whether this intervention would have any impact. There are no studies looking at the effect of UPT provision on earlier ANC initiation, nor is there reliable and positive&nbsp; evidence on the effect on CHWs\u2019 counseling on earlier ANC initiation. Additionally, we remain quite uncertain about many of the assumptions we made in our theory of change. The only causal link which we are certain about is the one between higher ANC attendance and decreased risk in neonatal mortality\u2014however, this relies on the quality of provided ANC which is fairly low in many countries.</p><p>Given the strong link between increased ANC and risk of neonatal mortality, we think further research could look at ways to promote earlier ANC initiation that have a more robust evidence base, such as via mass media campaigns. Research on UPT provision and/or pregnancy confirmation and its effects on ANC would also be relevant, when based on a needs assessment in a given context.<br>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnhe3euf0gui5\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefhe3euf0gui5\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/07-11-2016-new-guidelines-on-antenatal-care-for-a-positive-pregnancy-experience\"><u>WHO (2016)</u></a> recommends \u201cpregnant women to have their first contact in the first 12 weeks\u2019 gestation, with subsequent contacts taking place at 20, 26, 30, 34, 36, 38 and 40 weeks\u2019 gestation.\u201d</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnxksio0qpu99\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefxksio0qpu99\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>We also think it would be interesting to look at the effectiveness of radio campaigns in conjunction with the provision of urine pregnancy tests to CHWs.

I cover threats regardless of origin (zoonotic, diseases spread from animals into humans; accidental, those caused by humans without intent; or deliberate, as an act of warfare or terrorism). I hope in future to go into further details about my reasoning, including in a quantitative way. For now, I present them with some intuitive reasoning in footnotes.</p><h1>Summary</h1><ul><li><i>Direct</i><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmunvygli5sj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmunvygli5sj\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;spending on pandemic preparation might be comparable in cost-effectiveness to the best global health interventions (e.g.: malaria bed nets). This is based on the historic number of deaths from pandemics, but is a good guide to future impact.</li><li>The most likely reason that future threats will be significantly higher is from non-state malicious actors; however, this is highly uncertain. Promising mitigations may be low-cost and sensible, such as mandatory DNA synthesis screening.</li><li><i>Indirect </i>philanthropic spending, for instance increasing governmental or private spending on pandemics, is promising. This is especially true for interventions that also decrease the losses due to seasonal epidemics or noninfectious health risks (e.g.: indoor pollution).</li><li>There are few, if any, scenarios that lead to societal collapse. The only scenario I have seen that seems plausible is a so-called \u201cstealth\u201d pathogen (a pathogen is a virus, bacteria, or other microorganism that causes disease). I am extremely uncertain about the plausibility of such a scenario. The proposed response plans are inadequate to mitigate this risk, making tractability low.</li><li>A major weakness in our pandemic response is inadequate tools. This problem is worsened by early uncertainty in a pandemic, which makes it difficult to calibrate responses accurately. Currently, we have: imprecise and costly tools (e.g.: reducing interactions across society); tools that are hard to implement effectively (e.g.: masks or contact tracing); and tools that scale poorly (e.g.: border controls).</li></ul><h1>Introduction</h1><p>Pandemics have historically occurred every 4 years on average, killing, in expectation, 7 in 10,000 of the global population, or about 5.6 million deaths each time.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6vrq3s1jw4q\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6vrq3s1jw4q\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;This gives an expected death toll of 1.6 million per year.</p><p>How much should philanthropists be willing to spend to prevent this? <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\">GiveWell estimates global health interventions (e.g.: bednets to prevent malaria) can save a life for around $5,000 on average.</a> Therefore, to be equally cost-effective, preventing all pandemic deaths needs to cost $8 billion per year or less. Alternatively, a marginal benefit reducing deaths by 10% needs to cost no more than $800 million per year. The best opportunities, such as <a href=\"https://ippsecretariat.org/\">the 100 Days Mission</a>, likely cross this bar.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreferc37tabjmk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnerc37tabjmk\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Many opportunities are unlikely to pass this bar though, such as ongoing surveillance. Quantitative cost-effectiveness analyses are rarely available in this space, but should be encouraged to find other opportunities.</p><p>However, there are various ways more effective opportunities available for philanthropists than spending directly on preparedness.</p><p>Leveraging government or private sector spending. Rich world governments will spend $1 million or more to save a life. Spending on pandemic preparedness is much more likely to be cost-effective at this level. If a case can be made for private companies to invest (e.g.: because the interventions will reduce workplace absences) then the counterfactual is probably even better.</p><p>Deploying interventions that provide ongoing benefits,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcobe95vm3q\"><sup><a href=\"#fncobe95vm3q\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;even in the absence of a pandemic. Some exciting ideas in this category are <a href=\"http://sequencing-roadmap.org/\">clinical metagenomic sequencing</a> or <a href=\"https://progress.institute/indoor-air-quality/\">improving indoor air quality</a>. There seems to be interesting trials in both cases here, at least in the UK, with new standards for buildings and <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/guidance/siren-study\">programmes trialling more widespread metagenomic sequencing</a>.</p><p>One-off investments that require low ongoing costs. For example, if a new intervention can be developed (e.g.: a contact tracing app) that requires a one-off spend to develop, little maintenance, but can quickly be deployed at the first signs of an outbreak. Here, the one-off spend can accrue long-term benefits. Yet, we must be careful that these investments are not outpaced by technological or societal changes. Many systems developed in the wake of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic were irrelevant only a decade later for COVID-19, when video calling was much more available and mRNA vaccines were rapidly developed.</p><p>Increases in risk. Many have argued that, for various reasons, the risks of a pandemic are increasing over time, although the evidence-base is weak. For zoonotic risks, there is increased contact with animals due to habitat loss and more factory farming. For accidental risks, there are more labs doing risky research. For deliberate risks, access to the knowledge required to weaponize infectious diseases may become more widespread. The risk from deliberate risks is the most uncertain. Cost-effectiveness is hard to assess but there are low cost interventions (e.g.: DNA synthesis screening) that seem worthwhile.</p><p>Second-order effects. Some have argued that pandemics could cause long-term effects on humanity, causing societal collapse or extinction. The view that such risks should guide our actions is known as longtermism; <a href=\"https://joshuablake.co.uk/blog/longtermism-doubts/\">I am somewhat sceptical of this view</a>. However, even putting aside my scepticism of longtermism generally, the concerns here are currently very speculative.</p><p>In short, rich-world governments should spend more on pandemics, and we should look to convince private companies that reducing biological threats is in their best interest. I am very interested in ideas for one-off investments that could improve preparedness, but think the case for these is easy to overstate. Low-cost ways to mitigate increasing risks are also worth pursuing. More research into the likelihood of long-term effects of pandemics, and cost-effectiveness analyses of reducing this risk, would help analyse this space.</p><p>The next two sections give my reasoning behind changing risks and long-term threats, probably the most controversial of my views. The final section changes tack to consider the weaknesses in our response tools.</p><h1>Changing risks</h1><p>Humanity experienced, on average, 0.3 pandemics per year across the 17th and 18th centuries, 0.5 per year in the 100 years up until the end of the Second World War, but only 0.1 per year in the 79 years since.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefq0rq1jo8oed\"><sup><a href=\"#fnq0rq1jo8oed\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Any argument that the rate of pandemics is increasing must answer why, empirically, this risk has recently been below the historic rate.&nbsp;</p><p>Alternatively, one could argue that the risk could be increasing because the severity of each pandemic is increasing. I am not aware of any evidence for this. My prior is that we should be able to mitigate pandemics more effectively in the future. COVID-19 has taught us a lot such as: the effectiveness of lockdowns and how to deploy vaccines more rapidly than we ever have done in the past. There are further reasons to be more optimistic. To name a few: the 100 Days Mission (supported by the G7) to go even faster on vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics; new tools, including those utilising machine learning, to speed drug discovery; and technologies that will make home-working even easier making lockdowns less costly (e.g.: virtual reality or self-driving cars).</p><p>The argument that zoonotic pandemic risks are rising is weak. Much of the evidence for increasing animal-to-human disease transmission is confounded by better global diagnostics and only considers the post-war period.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefw6aq0cdww0k\"><sup><a href=\"#fnw6aq0cdww0k\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;There are reasonable mechanisms for increasing risk, such as deforestation leading to more human/animal interaction. But I am yet to see anything to update away from my view that pandemics are rarer than they have been historically.</p><p>Labs handling the most dangerous pathogens (BSL-4 labs) are <a href=\"https://www.kcl.ac.uk/warstudies/assets/global-biolabs-report-2023.pdf#page=5\">increasing in number</a>. Based on current trends, their risk will equal the historical risk from zoonotic diseases in the 2030s.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1461kz0plax9\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1461kz0plax9\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Therefore, while these may change the picture, they do not change the conclusions on cost-effectiveness, which need order-of-magnitude changes. While these pandemics might be in the more severe end of historic ones, the distribution of severity is probably not much greater.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9hibhzqpx3\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9hibhzqpx3\">[8]</a></sup></span></p><p>The final class of risk, and perhaps the most uncertain, is deliberate attacks. State actors, which have had and continue with bioweapons programmes, have the greatest potential. However, they seem likely limited by the indiscriminate nature of human-to-human transmissible bioweapons. This seems unlikely to change, although machine learning models allowing these states to discover more dangerous pathogens are perhaps threatening.</p><p>The more changeable class is terrorists and other non-state groups. Historically, they have been unable to use bioweapons.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefi6dnb5992yj\"><sup><a href=\"#fni6dnb5992yj\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, advancements in dual-use technologies could overcome this. For example more widespread access to DNA synthesis or more accessible access to information (e.g.: increased use of open source publishing or large language models such as ChatGPT functioning as \"search engines on steroids\"). Further research into these risks, including engagement between the scientific and intelligence/counter-terrorism communities, would be helpful to better assess these risks. There\u2019s plausibly some cheap and helpful interventions here, such as <a href=\"https://www.nti.org/about/programs-projects/project/preventing-the-misuse-of-dna-synthesis-technology/\">DNA synthesis screening</a>.</p><h1>Long-term effects</h1><p><a href=\"https://www.gcsp.ch/publications/securing-civilisation-against-catastrophic-pandemics\">Gopal et al. (2023)</a> argues that biological threats pose a threat to the long-term future of humanity due to causing societal collapse. They propose two scenarios whereby this could arise: \u201cwildfire\u201d pandemics that are so frightening that enough essential workers stay home, and \u201cstealth\u201d pandemics that infect such a large fraction of the global population before detection that we cannot respond to them.</p><p>A wildfire pandemic scenario is a disease spreading quickly to such an extent that even lockdowns cannot prevent their spread. Imagine early COVID-19 but more lethal or spreading several times as fast. Eventually, enough essential workers become infected or refuse to work (fearing for their lives), that society breaks down. This seems incredibly unlikely to me. First, such a disease would be far out-of-distribution of anything we have seen previously, combining the worst elements of a variety of pathogens. For a disease to continue growing exponentially in a lockdown (which could be stronger than those in COVID-19) would make it one of the most infectious diseases we have ever seen.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefelkbrh354r9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnelkbrh354r9\">[10]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Some pathogens (e.g.: influenza), that are very well-adapted to humans, have never managed this. Second, even if this does occur, it is unclear if it would lead to societal collapse. While it is hard to do much except speculate here, my intuition is that this is a very high bar. Humans, especially those fearing for their lives, are ingenious. We would likely find more efficient ways of operating society, needing fewer essential workers. Finally, the idea that essential workers would stay at home while society breaks down around them is implausible to me. I would welcome evidence to change my mind here, but that case has not been made.</p><p>Stealth pandemics do seem very scary. Their biological plausibility is highly uncertain, as is the ability to engineer these pathogens in the near or medium term. This is compounded because I think such a pathogen needs to be more severe than Gopal et al. suggest.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefg4cf5czhwiv\"><sup><a href=\"#fng4cf5czhwiv\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;A stealth pandemic needs to combine the worst elements of several pathogens that humans have ever faced, making it far out-of-distribution compared to anything we have seen. I am extremely uncertain here, have not seen arguments either way, and do not have any expertise.</p><p>There are plausibly some low-cost interventions to greatly increase our probability of detecting a stealth pandemic before it infects a significant fraction of the population. For example, metagenomic testing in easy-to-access or high-risk populations (e.g.: healthcare workers, blood or respiratory samples taken for other purposes, or travellers). If metagenomic sequencing became cheap and useful enough to justify for clinical reasons, this data would likely be enough. However, what to do following detection remains an unanswered question. Until these questions are answered, tractability on this issue remains low.</p><p>I am <a href=\"https://ineffectivealtruismblog.com/category/exaggerating-the-risks/biorisk/\">not the first to point out</a> that the arguments that biological risks have a reasonable chance of causing long-term harm to humans are weak. While these threats should be considered, I want to see quantitative cost-effectiveness before we redirect significant resources on this rationale.</p><h1>Pandemic response</h1><p>A major constraint on pandemic response is that our response tools are blunt. This means that taking a precautionary approach and responding early is expensive. Finding ways to better calibrate our response should be a high priority.</p><p>Restrictions on social activity, such as closing venues, are the fastest way we know of to stop a pathogen<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref41iy3xh0zdg\"><sup><a href=\"#fn41iy3xh0zdg\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;spreading; the most extreme version of this being a lockdown. These are expensive to implement from many perspectives, including economics and mental health. They also deprive individuals of their liberties, which is morally questionable. Arguably, this is because of their indiscriminate nature: everyone must stop activity regardless of their personal level of risk. We should look to find lower cost measures.</p><p>The most obvious version of granular measures are isolating only the individuals most likely to be infected. Contact tracing is the normal implementation of this, yet performed poorly in COVID-19. Either the criteria for tracing was spread broad (negating much of its use), or it had only marginal effects. The most promising paths for improvements here are rapid diagnostics or automated contact tracing. Both showed promise during the pandemic,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref33toq7r2fhf\"><sup><a href=\"#fn33toq7r2fhf\">[13]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and could be more impactful with better preparation.</p><p>Passive measures could also play an important part here. If we reduce the ability for a pathogen to spread, then we can mitigate pandemics without any restrictions on anyone\u2019s lives. Promising avenues here are improving indoor air quality either through better ventilation and filtration, or germicidal ultraviolet light.</p><p>Another avenue to pursue is to improve our ability to calibrate responses early in a pandemic. The large data and model uncertainty<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9765qt7ikpt\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9765qt7ikpt\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;means that true estimates of our uncertainty are extremely large in an outbreak\u2019s early phase. Yet, the quicker we can characterise the likely severity of an outbreak the more quickly we can respond appropriately. Numerous academic groups are exploring ways to enhance our response. Incremental progress across areas is likely our best hope.</p><p>Combined, the above suggestions will massively improve our response to outbreaks, before they become pandemics. Better knowledge will inform a response, which itself can be stepped up or down in a more granular way.</p><p><i>Thank you</i> <i>for</i> <i>reading to the end. <strong>I am currently looking for a job!</strong> If you think your organisation could benefit from this type of thinking, please </i><a href=\"mailto:joshbblake@gmail.com\"><i>get in touch</i></a><i>.</i></p><p><i>These thoughts are all my own, informed by discussions with a wide variety of people.

This involved updating and curating the dataset to focus more on quality over quantity. Additionally, we created a process to regularly fetch new articles from selected sources. The ARD contains information about alignment from various books, research papers, and blog posts. For a full list of all the sources being used, look at the readme of the repository on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/stampyAI/alignment-research-dataset\"><u>GitHub</u></a> or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/StampyAI/alignment-research-dataset\"><u>HuggingFace</u></a>.</p><p>We use a process called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/rag\"><u>retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)</u></a> to generate the answers. Since LLM data is static, RAG increases the capabilities of a LLM by referencing an external authoritative knowledge base before generating a response. So the process can be roughly broken into - 1) getting and storing the data in a vector database, and then 2) generating an answer based on that data.</p><p>The information storage process is outlined below:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/33KCtJfBTzK4TPjCy/gx4nqnplosdqhnc6julw\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/33KCtJfBTzK4TPjCy/se9ea47dk5w2edcrlrue 120w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/33KCtJfBTzK4TPjCy/jolbdyeacw9svroz8exa 240w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/33KCtJfBTzK4TPjCy/tynct1x13jb6gtbsm3bl 360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/33KCtJfBTzK4TPjCy/uevh2bl9ow0o5dkqxsxd 480w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/33KCtJfBTzK4TPjCy/h6fimtfqsyc9xw8moruc 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/33KCtJfBTzK4TPjCy/dzdz0vzqizrdbnglcexu 720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/33KCtJfBTzK4TPjCy/tz1ioxbogfccflkhkxac 840w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/33KCtJfBTzK4TPjCy/yv2yl29xfhnyaayc9mdt 960w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/33KCtJfBTzK4TPjCy/wuuubt7s4uoy4cmkl1an 1080w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/33KCtJfBTzK4TPjCy/ospfvubhtrgvodkwvoqd 1172w\"></figure><p>Source: DeepLearning.AI (2023) \u201c<a href=\"https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/langchain-chat-with-your-data/\"><u>LangChain: Chat with Your Data</u></a>\u201d</p><ul><li><strong>Document Loading</strong>: The articles are scraped from various sources such as the ones mentioned above.

This dataset is available on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/datasets/StampyAI/alignment-research-dataset\"><u>HuggingFace</u></a>, which includes instructions on how to download and use it.

Some planned features include adding a thumbs up or down option next to completions, so that we can A/B test our prompts. There might also eventually be an option to easily share or save conversation histories to the local machine.</p><p>The text of some answers also relies on equations, so we are working on getting properly formatted equations rendered in LaTeX.</p><p>Other potential future plans include offering a semantic search of the ARD as an OpenAI API function call or plug-in.

However, poor inclusion of non-native English speakers means missed perspectives in decision-making. Hence, it\u2019s a vicious circle where lack of diversity persists: native English culture prevails at the thought leadership level and neglects other cultures by failing to acknowledge that it is inherently harder to stand out as a non-native English speaker.</p><h2>Why I am writing this</h2><p>I\u2019m co-directing EA Switzerland (I\u2019m originally from France), and I\u2019ve been thinking about the following points for some time. I\u2019ve been invited to speak at the Panel on Community Building at EAG Boston 2023, where I shared a rougher version of those thoughts. I was pretty scared to share this in a place where the vast majority of attendees matched the description \u201cnative English speaker\u201d, but after talking to a few people, it felt true.&nbsp;<strong>Many of the non-native speakers related, and many of the native speakers acknowledged it.</strong> I believe it\u2019s possible that not enough people are thinking about it (especially the ones that should think about it more than the rest - the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XweBntieePnzQyLtK/rowing-and-steering-the-effective-altruism-movement\"><u>steerers</u></a>). I\u2019m pretty scared to share it here too of course, but&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4WxHNBf5LeM9gQneT/you-should-write-on-the-ea-forum\"><u>it\u2019s probably worth it</u></a>.</p><h2>An unconscious bias against non-native English speakers</h2><blockquote><p>The beauty of linguistic diversity is that it reveals to us just how ingenious and how flexible the human mind is. Human minds have invented not one cognitive universe, but 7,000.</p></blockquote><p>- Lera Boroditsky</p><h3>Non-native English speakers sound less convincing</h3><p>The neural pathways that form in your brain during childhood will affect how you think as an adult. Depending on where and with which languages and cultures you grew up, the conceptual space in which your brain processes and communicates information will be different. Then, when a non-native speaker expresses their thoughts and opinions in English, most times it will be&nbsp;<strong>lower-fidelity than native speakers</strong>, and will probably be&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/qf6pGhm9a7vTMFLtc/english-as-a-dominant-language-in-the-movement-challenges\"><strong><u>less convincing and/or</u></strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pyDFnrrhJEjQhMywY/native-languages-in-the-ea-community-and-issues-with\"><strong><u>sound less smart</u></strong></a>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefn7ej7spuoq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnn7ej7spuoq\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>Besides, I can relate to the experience shared&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/tZbMtxQk42teAFBYs/native-english-speaker-eas-could-you-please-speak-slower\"><u>here</u></a> that native English speakers are sometimes hard to follow when your own native language (and culture) is not English.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefloivdpab4fb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnloivdpab4fb\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I guess it\u2019s especially true when your English is good enough that it doesn\u2019t appear necessary to speak slower - but I think for most of us, it still is necessary to&nbsp;<strong>speak slower or repeat stuff, and avoid referencing local pop culture</strong>. Usually though, non-native speakers would like to avoid asking to slow down, repeat, or clarify because, on top of being burdensome, it can be associated with incompetence.</p><p>Hence, it\u2019s important&nbsp;<strong>not to confuse competence with language proficiency,</strong> and keep in mind that for the majority of non-native English speakers, it\u2019s harder to engage with the materials, harder to understand and intervene in debates, and harder to speak and write with fidelity to one\u2019s thoughts. As a consequence, it\u2019s then&nbsp;<strong>harder to be understood, stand out, get hired, and get heard.</strong> A similar case has been made for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pyDFnrrhJEjQhMywY/native-languages-in-the-ea-community-and-issues-with\"><u>less-STEM-than-average people in EA</u></a>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbtym3cox7kr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbtym3cox7kr\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><p>Additionally, the English language and vocabulary might also not allow one to express the full length of their thoughts \u2013 words might not even exist for them.&nbsp;<strong>Different languages can allow for different profiles of available concepts and thoughts</strong>, because their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKK7wGAYP6k\"><u>structure and vocabulary vary</u></a>.</p><h3>Poor inclusion of non-native English speakers means missed perspectives</h3><p>One could consider the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://geerthofstede.com/culture-geert-hofstede-gert-jan-hofstede/6d-model-of-national-culture/\"><u>6 dimensions of culture</u></a> as a good illustration of the effect of culture (and then, language) on our values.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9gmvqegf72\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9gmvqegf72\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Lower language diversity then means lower diversity of worldviews and opinions.</p><p>I\u2019m afraid that&nbsp;<strong>native English cultures are disproportionately represented on the EA Forum, in grant-making organizations, and within research institutions.</strong><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7xddxkbviiv\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7xddxkbviiv\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;My guess for the reason is a mix of the founders' effect and English being a native language for those overrepresented cultures \u2013 hence it\u2019s easier to engage with the content, connect with people, \u201cclimb the ladder\u201d, etc. If that\u2019s true, then the discourse that is presented there is probably&nbsp;<strong>missing some perspectives</strong> from the broader community.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefm5u9s9dj5e9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnm5u9s9dj5e9\">[6]</a></sup></span></p><h3>Native English speakers are overrepresented in EA\u2019s thought leadership: a vicious circle</h3><p>This discourse, however, shapes decision-making.

We should want more diversity at the level of our movement's thought leaders.</p><p>The&nbsp;<strong>monopoly on funding</strong> does not facilitate this \u2013 my impression is that it is especially true in community building. Indeed, homogeneity in culture and ways of thinking might strengthen itself with grantmakers selecting projects and people who are closer to them, easier to understand or better explained from their perspective, or anchored in a familiar thought system, and&nbsp;<strong>this bias is hard to overcome</strong>. I\u2019m not arguing that funders should fund projects they don\u2019t believe in \u2013 instead, I believe that different strategies and different teams of grantmakers will help&nbsp;<strong>diversify the projects</strong> that are funded. I\u2019ve once been told that it was hard to assess a specific Swiss project's quality because they did not know how selective it was, while they have a much better sense of this from projects that are happening in the US \u2013 I\u2019m afraid that this leads to really&nbsp;<strong>promising projects being deprioritized</strong>. I concede that we don\u2019t have easy actions to take to improve this. But we need to acknowledge it and work with it.</p><h2>What can we do about it?</h2><h3>Some prompts</h3><p>I don\u2019t have clear solutions, but can offer these questions instead:</p><ul><li>How do we improve diversity in the movement and at the level of the thought leaders?

It\u2019s a guide for thinking about them from various angles with an eye to what the strategic implications might be.

Many of the particular insights here are due to other people. I want to say thanks to Adam Bales, Anna Wang, Buck Shlegeris, Carl Shulman, Daniel Dewey, Eric Drexler, Max Dalton, Nate Soares, Rebecca Cotton-Barratt, Rohin Shah, Rose Hadshar, Tom Davidson, and especially Beth Barnes, David Manheim, Lukas Finnveden, and Toby Ord, for helpful comments and/or conversations.</p><h1>2. &nbsp; &nbsp; What type of thing are language models?</h1><h2>2.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; Emulating civilization, not individual people</h2><p>The field of AI was originally about reproducing human intelligence. Humans are good at finding patterns and learning things. If we could automate the type of thinking they do, that would be a big deal. If we could build automated systems which were better general learners and thinkers than humans, it would transform the world.</p><p>Language models aren\u2019t really trying to do the same thing. This may be a surprising claim; they\u2019re a type of machine learning, which is doing exactly this. However, I think it\u2019s clearer to think of language models as a specialized&nbsp;<i>application</i> of machine learning. Sure, they make use of machine learning techniques, but their game isn\u2019t really \u201cbe better than humans at learning from a certain amount of language\u201d (indeed they\u2019re fed with so much data that they can be much more inefficient than humans, and I don\u2019t think this is a crux for how important they will be). It\u2019s \u201creplicate the kind of things humans say\u201d.</p><p>This is powerful because humans, collectively, know a bunch of stuff, both implicitly and explicitly. There\u2019s a lot of knowledge and intelligence which is crystallized in our writing. If the language models of today seem to know a lot of things, this isn\u2019t because they\u2019ve gone out and understood the world directly, but because they\u2019re leveraging knowledge which is represented in human text.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover language is the medium via which we construct concepts and make explicit arguments \u2014 powerful tools for understanding and acting in the world. The ability to approximate human writing \u2014 even if not based on the same underlying learning abilities \u2014 might reproduce a lot of that intelligence.&nbsp;</p><p>All of this matters for thinking about the impacts language models are likely to have, and where they might be going. In slogan form, perhaps:</p><blockquote><p><i>Machine learning reimplements human intelligence.</i></p><p><i>Language models emulate humanity\u2019s collective intelligence.</i></p></blockquote><p>Note that language models&nbsp;<i>could</i> be used to emulate the written output of individual people, if a prompt was specific enough that it tightly specified the author. But this isn\u2019t their default mode \u2014 mostly predicting text will depend on averages across a lot of different (possible) people (weighted by how likely those people were to be writing about the topic).</p><h2>2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; An extremely crude picture of how language models work</h2><p>For the purposes of this document, what I think is important:</p><ul><li>Language models are doing \u201cnext-token\u201d generation. This amounts to doing things word-by-word \u2014 given an input string, they produce a further token continuing it, and if you want a longer text you repeat this.</li><li>Language models are large neural nets, with some specific architectures (notably transformers) which have been found to be efficient for language learning.</li><li>When a language model is run to make a token prediction (a \u201cforward pass\u201d through the model), it can only do a relatively limited amount of computation; however since they are large they may contain things approximating large lookup tables, and contain a lot of crystallized intelligence that way.</li><li>Language models are trained by gradient descent \u2014 searching through the (vast) space of possible parameters to find ones which iteratively perform better.</li><li>\u201cFoundation models\u201d are the most straightforward version of language models. They are trained on a corpus of text, to generate text from the same distribution. If they are given a prompt, they will predict what the most likely continuation of that prompt would be, if it were drawn from the same distribution as the training data.</li><li>Some of the more interesting and powerful applications of language models do something beyond just working with foundation models.</li></ul><h2>2.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; What are foundation models approximating?</h2><p>We can think of foundation models as a series of approximations. A given foundation model W<sub>i</sub> approximates the limit W<sub>Text</sub> of what we could achieve with ideal machine learning and all extant text. This in turn approximates W<sub>Omega</sub>, which is the true distribution human writing is drawn from. Foundation models can never actually achieve \u201cthe true distribution\u201d, but understanding that this is what they\u2019re approximating may help us to understand their scope as a technology.</p><p>Here\u2019s a digression digging a bit deeper on these concepts:</p><ul><li>W<sub>Omega</sub> is the hypothetical which foundation models approximate, predicting human language continuations in line with the true underlying distribution<ul><li>It\u2019s a little vague how this \u201cthe true distribution\u201d is defined, but let\u2019s suppose that we get writing from not just our world but a bunch of close counterfactual worlds (including ones which are slightly in the future), with probability mass falling off for worlds which are at greater counterfactual distance from our own.</li><li>W<sub>Omega</sub> is a black box, not structured as a neural net<ul><li>It\u2019s likely that it&nbsp;<i>can\u2019t</i> be perfectly instantiated as a neural net (of non-astronomical size):<ul><li>In order to perform optimally, it would need in some sense contains implicit models at least as rich as all humans \u2014 if it\u2019s predicting text, it wants to be able to make inferences about the type of person that might be writing it, and if it\u2019s a long way into a piece of text then it will be making complex inferences about their psychology to predict the next words<ul><li>In fact it would need to be capable of harder tasks than humans are, since&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nH4c3Q9t9F3nJ7y8W/gpts-are-predictors-not-imitators\"><u>prediction is harder than imitation</u></a></li></ul></li><li>Almost certainly there are enough cases where there\u2019s an irreducibly large amount of computation needed to make predictions that it can\u2019t fit all of that into a forward pass \u2014 nor store enough information to have cached answers in all of those cases</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>A black box which literally gave access to W<sub>Omega</sub> would be a very powerful artefact<ul><li>As well as excellent predictions about individual humans, W<sub>Omega</sub> probably contains a lot of implicit knowledge about the the world \u2014 perhaps more than humanity understands. It will be able to tell which hypothetical scientific theories are plausible continuations of current progress, and which are not. With the right coaxing it might be possible to extract some of this knowledge from it.<ul><li>This probably won\u2019t work for radically different technological regimes \u2014 these are far enough out of distribution that if a piece of text starts describing a radically new form of science or technology, it may be more likely to be some kind of fiction or mistake than some distant counterfactual world with much more advanced technology</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>W<sub>Text</sub> is a theoretical limit of what\u2019s achievable with machine learning in the actual world<ul><li>It\u2019s again vague how it\u2019s defined, but roughly:<ul><li>It\u2019s only trained on actually-extant human writing</li><li>It trains a neural net, which may be larger than existing ones or make use of new architectures, but isn\u2019t astronomically large</li><li>It only has access to a finite amount of compute (say all currently extant compute for a year)</li></ul></li><li>W<sub>Text&nbsp;</sub>&nbsp;is an approximation to W<sub>Omega</sub>, and likely has several of the same properties, in weaker forms:<ul><li>Computational constraints will prevent it from considering very complex world models like simulations<ul><li>It therefore won\u2019t contain models \u201cas rich as all humans\u201d; however it likely still will be good or very good at predicting human psychology, and it will have a lot of implicit knowledge about the world</li></ul></li><li>I think it may more often be an issue that it&nbsp;<i>only</i> has text as a window to understand the world \u2014 if there\u2019s something that\u2019s only been written about a handful of times, or that people have been pretty bad at understanding/describing, that thing may be severely underdetermined from the perspective of W<sub>Text</sub> (whereas W<sub>Omega</sub> has direct access to the underlying distribution)<ul><li>Though see the discussion of multimodal models in Section 4.3</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>It\u2019s instantiated as a neural net<ul><li>This means that if in the process of learning to do good token prediction it\u2019s implicitly learned about important structures in the world, that knowledge is somehow encoded in its data structures, and there may be ways other than simply asking for token predictions to access/use and extract value from that</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Actual foundation models W<sub>i</sub> are approximations to W<sub>Text</sub><ul><li>They are weaker in two ways, analogously to how W<sub>Text</sub> is weaker than W<sub>Omega</sub>:<ul><li>1) They are trained on smaller corpuses</li><li>2) They are weaker predictors even for these smaller corpuses<ul><li>Their hypothesis space is smaller/worse (presumably using less variables, and likely also lacking some architectural benefits)</li><li>They are further away from being trained to convergence</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Both of these weaknesses have real impacts<ul><li>The net effect is that rather than something of superhuman intelligence, we get something like an \u201cinebriated\u201d version of W<sub>Text</sub></li><li>Stronger language models are less inebriated than weaker versions, although they generally seem to stay below the threshold of human expertise (for now)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h1>3. &nbsp; &nbsp; Techniques for getting value from language models</h1><p>A major focus of research on language models has been on improving the foundation models \u2014 getting better approximations to W<sub>Text</sub>. But there is important complementary research in the question: for a fixed foundation model W<sub>i</sub>, how can you do useful things? There are few different techniques:</p><h2>3.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; Prompt engineering</h2><p>The output of foundation models depends on the prompts they are given. This would be true of W<sub>Omega</sub> \u2014 the value of being able to sample from all possible human documents would be importantly dependent on the ability to steer towards the most useful parts of document space. For the weaker foundation models we have, there may be other helpful tricks in designing prompts.</p><p>Over the last couple of years, as people have played around with language models, there has been a lot of parallelized labour into finding the style of prompts that is most likely to lead to good things. To the extent that people are finding knowledge about how to get value out of W<sub>Omega</sub>, this will generalize to future language models; to the extent that they\u2019re learning tricks peculiar to the current generation of foundation models, it may not.</p><h2>3.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; Scaffolding</h2><p>Scaffolding is the general category of designing environments around language models which feed them prompts and process their outputs. Scaffolding is a broad category of which the most straightforward case is just prompt engineering, but in general it allows for complex procedures where the output in response to earlier prompts is fed into other software tools, and these determine what is put into later prompts.</p><p>For example, scaffolding could allow for a model to make multi-stage plans and then call separate instances to execute each of those stages without losing track or where it is, and to make use of tools such as browsing the internet and writing and executing software.</p><p>Limits of what might be achievable via scaffolding are discussed in Section 6.3.2.</p><h2>3.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; Finetuning</h2><p>Finetuning takes a foundation model and runs more machine learning to adjust just some of the weights \u2014 using the foundation model to give an inductive in its search for more refined models. The idea is that it\u2019s much easier to find models which are smart in arbitrary ways if you\u2019re restricted to a much smaller-dimensional search space. For small amounts of finetuning, we might think of the inductive bias as being roughly \u201conly consider saying things that humans might say\u201d. For larger amounts of finetuning the bias might be more structural, making use (in opaque ways) of implicit knowledge the language model has to restrict the search space.</p><p>Finetuning relies on having some metric, or feedback loop, to train things towards. This could be given by some body of text it\u2019s trying to emulate, or by some other function of text output.&nbsp;</p><h2>3.4 &nbsp; &nbsp; Combining these</h2><p>Scaffolding and finetuning can be combined. Generically I think they will be. For it not to make sense to use scaffolding it would be the case that the trivial scaffold performed (roughly) as well as anything else. I think this is implausible at least in the short term. And it would be even more surprising if foundation models \u2014 which were selected for their ability to emulate human outputs \u2014 happened to be optimized among close by systems for their performance when used in an effective scaffold. I therefore think it\u2019s implausible that it won\u2019t be optimal to make use of finetuning.</p><p>We might think of finetuning as analogous to on-the-job training for the use-case at hand, and scaffolding as analogous to setting up a good management structure and organizational protocols. The analogy supports the idea that a combination of the two may be most effective.</p><h1>4. &nbsp; &nbsp; Natural limits of language models</h1><p>In Section 5 we\u2019ll start to look at the impacts language models will have in the world as they are further developed and deployed. In order to facilitate that, in this section we\u2019ll look at some natural limits on the kind of things language models are doing. We\u2019ll be concerned with \u201cwhat kind of outputs can they produce?\u201d; questions of how fast they can produce those, or how they are integrated into society are of central importance for how much impact they end up having, but out of scope for what I want to explore in this section.</p><h2>4.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; Approximating human capabilities, not superhuman capabilities</h2><p>There\u2019s a common argument about AI that goes roughly:</p><blockquote><p>There\u2019s nothing special about human capability levels. In any given domain, if AI capabilities are advancing rapidly towards human-level, they\u2019ll probably continue advancing rapidly way past human-level.</p></blockquote><p>Foundation models have been rapidly advancing towards giving human-level responses to many different types of questions: they are rapidly approaching human-level at writing poetry, or explaining physics, or concocting recipes \u2014 in the sense that they are far closer to human level now than they were three years ago. Foundation models, however, are&nbsp;<i>emulating human outputs</i>. To the extent that they have human capabilities, they have these via emulation. So the argument doesn\u2019t apply (at least in the straightforward way); rather, we should&nbsp;<i>expect</i> progress to slow down when the quality of their outputs are somewhere in the vicinity of (peak) human performance.</p><p>There are a couple of important caveats here:</p><ul><li>There are techniques based on scaffolding and on finetuning which could help to push performance to the superhuman regime<ul><li>In this case, human performance could still be a distinguished point in terms of what can be achieved via emulation rather than a different approach, but at some point it might rapidly be obsoleted</li><li>I\u2019ll discuss possible paths for scaling language models towards superintelligence in a later section</li></ul></li><li>We&nbsp;<i>can</i> apply the argument (that we should expect performance to blow quickly past human level) to capabilities which belong to the process that trains language models, rather than abilities the trained models have learned from their text corpus<ul><li>e.g. \u201chow good are they at learning language?\u201d, or probably \u201chow good are they at generalizing patterns?\u201d</li><li>But not \u201chow good are they at knowing the law?\u201d, or \u201chow good are they at providing strategic advice?\u201d</li></ul></li></ul><h2>4.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; Limited cognition per forward pass</h2><p>To produce a single token, a language model makes a single forward pass over the neural net. To produce longer pieces of text, it repeatedly produces single tokens, with everything it\u2019s produced so far added to the context.</p><p>Each forward pass amounts to something of similar complexity to multiplying together some large matrices. This gives lots of room for something like consulting an index and accessing stored knowledge, but relatively limited space for something like \u201cthinking new thoughts\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>By analogy, when humans learn arithmetic they do it by a mix of rote memorization \u2014 many of us see \u201c3x7\u201d and instinctively know that the answer is \u201c21\u201d without calculating anything \u2014 and processes for calculating things (e.g. long division). Language models are structured in a way that can make them good at the rote memorization part, but they cannot in a single forward pass do a large amount of following a process.</p><p>This means that we can construct tasks that even very strong foundation models will predictably be weak at. e.g. \u2014&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The remainder of [352 digit number] when divided by [219 digit number] is \u2026</p></blockquote><p>W<sub>Omega</sub> probably gets this right most of the time. But W<sub>Text</sub> probably gets it wrong almost all of the time. (Unless there are some heuristic tricks I\u2019m unaware of. I\u2019d be more confident in my example if it asked for prime factorizations.)</p><p>There are three important caveats here:</p><ul><li>In a single forward pass, language models are not restricted to rote memorization, but can use an arsenal of simple heuristics as well. The key constraint is that the amount of new thinking is very limited, not that there is none.</li><li>It\u2019s hard to infer limits on \u201chow smart a language model can be\u201d, since it could have a lot of extremely smart ideas as ~cached thoughts (an analogue of rote memorization) which it could reproduce given the right prompt.&nbsp;<ul><li>This could be thought of as analogous to the \u201cChinese room\u201d thought experiment</li><li>If we\u2019re positing a language model which has extremely smart ideas in this way, it begs the question \u201cby what process did these thoughts originate?\u201d<ul><li>In the preceding section, I give an argument that for today\u2019s language models, we\u2019re seeing the fruits of them having humanity\u2019s past thinking as their cached thoughts, but we can entertain processes which produce smarter things</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>With many forward passes, language models could do a lot of cognition<ul><li>In order to have this meaningfully address the different parts of the problem, some structure would need to ensure that they meaningfully decomposed the necessary thinking, and that different forward passes received the relevant context to let them do the respective pieces<ul><li>By default I think that getting many forward passes just by letting language models produce long text answers won\u2019t help in the relevant way</li><li>\u201cChain of thought\u201d, where language models are prompted to show their thinking, could help significantly with this, as different places in the thinking could make it clear what needs to be thought about next</li><li>More generally, scaffolding seems like a powerful tool for helping with this</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2>4.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; Missing cognitive moves?</h2><p>Language models are capable of reproducing some types of ~atomic cognitive move that humans use. There may be others \u2014 at least at any given moment in time \u2014 that they cannot reproduce.</p><p>Reasons that they might not be able to reproduce a given cognitive move:</p><ul><li>The architecture used for the model doesn\u2019t support it as a simple structure</li><li>There isn\u2019t enough space in the neural net to do the move in a single forward pass</li><li>The training process doesn\u2019t give a good path to learning the move (even if it could in theory be supported on the given neural net)</li></ul><p>It\u2019s worth being aware that there could be constraints from these on what language models can do, but that this might change as architectures improve or models become bigger. (Furthermore, it might be that at some stage \u2014 if not already \u2014 language models can make useful cognitive moves that humans are incapable of.)</p><h3>Multimodal models</h3><p>One concern might be that language models are only equipped to deal with things in language. How do multimodal models affect this picture? Multimodal language language models are the same basic technology as language models, but they use encodings of non-text data into a kind of text to allow the models to interface with this non-text data. They can output non-text via the encoding if that\u2019s the thing that the language model predicts will happen.</p><p>Multimodal language models are therefore able to interface with and think about non-text data. But they may (at least for now) be more likely to lack the correct architecture to reproduce the type of cognitive moves humans do with non-text data. However, language models could be augmented with various capacities by using scaffolding to give them access to interfaces which permit them to query other kinds of objects (e.g. image processing; running physics simulations).</p><h1>5. &nbsp; &nbsp; Early major impacts of language models?</h1><h2>5.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; Principles for thinking about this</h2><p>The main metaphor I use to think about this goes as follows:</p><blockquote><p>Suppose you have a large workforce of relatively expert people \u2014 whom you can train at significant expense and then will work very fast for a very small fraction of minimum wage \u2014 but they\u2019re all a bit drunk and only working from home. What can you usefully do with them?</p></blockquote><p>Of course this metaphor isn\u2019t perfect (and readers may want to think about its imperfections to critique the conclusions I draw from it), but I think it\u2019s probably pretty good as a starting point. A major intuition that I have about that scenario \u2014 which I think is probably accurate about the actual situation with language models \u2014 is \u201cwow, there\u2019s a really big prize available here for whoever can figure out how to use these folks to do useful stuff\u201d. And there will certainly be incentives to develop techniques to mitigate the obvious disadvantages of being drunk (e.g. via automated error checking).</p><p>A couple of people have mentioned to me another metaphor: a large force of interns. I think this is also good; it\u2019s a little better in suggesting that by default they don\u2019t know much about the task at hand, but a little worse in suggesting that they get their knowledge about the domain by looking things up rather than by half-remembering (or occasionally fabricating) facts, and in suggesting strategies like \u201cidentify the good interns\u201d which don\u2019t really translate over.</p><p>A quick note/aside on the economics:</p><blockquote><p>&nbsp;As of mid-2023, GPT-4 costs around $0.1 per 1,000 tokens (around 750 words). That\u2019s about 10 minutes of typing at 75wpm. So we\u2019re looking at getting this work at around $0.6/hour \u2014 equivalent to perhaps 5% of minimum wage in rich countries. I don\u2019t know how high the markup that OpenAI charges is relative to their marginal cost of providing the service, but I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if the production cost at the margin is much cheaper than that (they charge like 2% of that \u2014 0.1% of minimum wage \u2014 for older models, and my guess is that that\u2019s much closer to the marginal production cost for them, and could still be significantly above marginal production cost). Perhaps newer more sophisticated models will be more expensive, but also perhaps progress (or improving compute) drives down prices. (Of course if compute starts being super valuable for this purpose that is likely to push the price of compute up, at least until compute manufacturing can be scaled up to meet demand again.)</p></blockquote><p>OK, so that\u2019s the groundwork. Now to think about what this could mean for where the transformative impacts come. Some observations:</p><ul><li>Likely there are some tasks for which it\u2019s much easier to get useful work out of drunk experts than others<ul><li>Especially ones where you don\u2019t need them to be super reliable or to follow long/complex chains of reasoning</li></ul></li><li>We should expect the early major applications to be ones where:<ul><li>It\u2019s easy to get useful work out of drunk experts, &amp;</li><li>There\u2019s a lot of work that can be done by the same experts (without retraining to niche cases, which could get expensive)</li></ul></li><li>There may be some significant impacts on the labour market as some work is automated away \u2014 and this could have serious social/political effects \u2014 but it\u2019s unlikely to be directly transformative in cases where the elasticity of demand isn\u2019t high (so the volume of work doesn\u2019t go up much even when the price drops a lot)</li><li>Potentially transformative: work where elasticity of demand is high (so that when the price drops a lot we just get a lot more of that work done)</li></ul><h2>5.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; Important early areas for automation</h2><p>There are several categories of intellectual labour that I think might be automatable with language models and really important. Three of them together I think might change the world a lot \u2014 perhaps on a comparable scale to the industrial revolution, but probably not radically beyond that. In roughly increasing order of importance, they are:</p><ul><li>Expert advice (teaching, medical advice, coaching, legal advice, consultancy, \u2026)<ul><li>There are lots of things where people benefit from professional advice, but it\u2019s expensive so many don\u2019t get to access it</li><li>In a world where this is cheap this affects a lot of people\u2019s lives<ul><li>Elasticity of demand is pretty high, and this likely caps out many times higher than current demand \u2014 but it ultimately does probably cap out</li></ul></li><li>I think it\u2019s very likely that major applications are possible here without any fundamental advances in the foundation models</li><li>Of course people would&nbsp;<i>prefer</i> advice from experts who aren\u2019t drunk and don\u2019t hallucinate, but:<ul><li>If this kind of error is only occasional, they may prefer to have it than not to get the advice</li><li>People are likely to work out tricks to reduce the frequency and impact of these issues&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Software engineering<ul><li>The reason this is potentially a big deal is that software builds on software \u2014 we get layers of architecture assembling into largescale valuable things. Elasticity of demand could be high if civilization uses this to develop new digital capabilities.</li><li>This also probably facilitates the big two (see below).</li><li>We may expect to see success here from language models, since:<ul><li>Software is naturally language-based, and we\u2019ve already seen LLMs do well with it</li><li>Software is a domain where it\u2019s easy to evaluate success, which means that it\u2019s a relatively easy domain to train things to do well at</li></ul></li><li>Big successes (involving planning the architecture for complex pieces of software) may or may not require significant improvements in foundation models&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Management<ul><li>Overseeing established systems and processes and keeping them running well</li><li>Can include all different kind of scales of management, e.g.:<ul><li>Personnel management (keeping in touch with people working and ensuring that they\u2019re staying on task and well-motivated, and issues they have can be raised appropriately)</li><li>Project management</li><li>Inventory management</li><li>Customer service (managing a good relationship with a customer)</li><li>Implementation of an interface with standard rules for what should happen (e.g. could potentially replace many government services)</li></ul></li><li>NB effective automation of management may be trickier than effective automation of expert advice for a couple of reasons:<ul><li>It\u2019s really crucial to be able to handle the inebriation issue \u2014 you want your management structures to be highly reliable</li><li>Effective implementation is going to require integration into messy human structures, which will likely take a bunch of time to experiment with and for people to get used to, beyond the point where it would be technologically feasible</li></ul></li><li>Nonetheless I think it\u2019s highly likely that a lot of management could be automated without significant further progress in foundation models</li><li>Automation of management seems like a big deal in terms of enabling the construction of large classes of automated structures/systems<ul><li>In this sense it\u2019s a broadening of software (which is the automation of very precisely specified tasks and the assembly of these into larger structures); I don\u2019t know what all of the applications might be, but it seems like a big deal as a possible platform technology&nbsp;</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><h2>5.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; The big two applications</h2><p>More important than the preceding, I think there are two really important applications, which have the potential to radically reshape the world:</p><ul><li>Research<ul><li>The ability to develop and test out new ideas, adding to the body of knowledge we have accumulated</li><li>Automating this would be a massive deal for the usual reasons about feeding back into growth rates, facilitating something like a singularity<ul><li>In particular the automation of further AI development is likely to be important</li></ul></li><li>There are many types of possible research, and automation may look quite different for e.g. empirical medical research vs fundamental physics vs political philosophy<ul><li>The sequence in which we get the ability to automate different types of research could be pretty important for determining what trajectory the world is on</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Executive capacity<ul><li>The ability to look at the world, form views about how it should be different, and form and enact plans to make it different</li><li>(People sometimes use \u201cagency\u201d to describe a property in this vicinity)</li><li>This is the central thing that leads to new things getting done in the world. If this were fully automated we might have large fully autonomous companies building more and more complex things towards effective purposes.</li><li>This is also the thing which, (if/)when automated, creates concerns about AI takeover risk.</li></ul></li></ul><p>I think that these two categories are likely at least somewhat harder to get high quality automated work out of than expert advice or management. Why?</p><ul><li>They seem to have to keep more things in mind and deal with complex situations&nbsp;<ul><li>So that \u201cbeing drunk\u201d seems like more of a hindrance</li></ul></li><li>The most important work is often:<ul><li>less close to \u201cworking from a script / playbook\u201d&nbsp;<ul><li>(things that language models excel at)</li></ul></li><li>more close to \u201cstare into the void until you have a vision that functions well with the shape of the world, and then use language to articulate the thing you\u2019re thinking about\u201d&nbsp;<ul><li>(not a natural MO for language models, at least on the face of it; this could relate to the discussion in the previous section on missing cognitive moves)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul><p>I\u2019m not sure how big/thorny these obstructions are. The prizes from automating them are very high, so there will be a lot of pressure to find the paths of least resistance. e.g. even if the most efficient way for humans (and hypothetical ideal AI) to do work here is more like \u201cstare into the void and then bring it back to the domain of language\u201d rather than just doing all the reasoning at the verbal level, if there\u2019s a way to get comparably good results by doing everything at the explicit verbal level and it\u2019s just 100x slower, that could still be enough to get you something transformative.</p><p>High quality software engineering has some of the same obstructions, but because it\u2019s so easy to get a high-quality success metric, we may expect self-play to help push model performance up to human-level and beyond relatively early. Research and executive capacity face issues with epistemic grounding: how can you be confident that one angle leads to better takes than another? We may ultimately need to rely on real-world feedback loops to help learn this, but they may be slow.</p><p>We should probably expect research and executive capacity to be partially automated (and so performed by centaurs, i.e. human\u2013AI teams) before they\u2019re fully automated. At minimum, many people in research and executive roles spend good fractions of their time on software or management tasks, so automating the latter would increase total capacity for the former.</p><h1>6. &nbsp; &nbsp; Timelines and takeoffs</h1><h2>6.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; How quickly is all of this likely to happen?</h2><p>My view is that for a lot of the pieces with significant societal impacts, the fundamental technology is already here. Over the next 5\u201310 years we might see people building and deploying systems which do a lot of stuff in the world, based on near-term-accessible language models. A lot of innovation will come from startups doing \u201cX with AI\u201d, for various applications X mostly providing expert advice or management services. They will often start by doing it in ways that have human oversight for quality control and training purposes, but reduce the degree of human oversight over time. By default the developers will make use of both finetuning and scaffolding \u2014 just hackily throwing stuff together to find out what works.&nbsp;</p><p>The vibe I\u2019m imagining for this is something like the Industrial Revolution or the Wild West, not a nuclear arms race. This could be enough to create significant social unease, centred in the middle classes, as many people see their livelihoods threatened, and more feel uncomfortable with how fast everything is changing.</p><p>(If I\u2019m wrong about them having big impacts over this timescale, it\u2019s probably because of some important missing cognitive move which restricts their usability \u2014 perhaps something about reliability. But my guess is that these kind of issues will turn out not to be a big problem, or will be surmountable given the scale of the prizes.)</p><p>We&nbsp;<i>may&nbsp;</i>see something more like a race for big-2 capabilities. Because if fully automated they can potentially be deployed at very large scale by a single actor (rather than quickly saturating demand), the incentives for a pure race could exist. However, I think it\u2019s most likely that for a while centaurs will significantly outperform fully automated systems \u2014 if this is right then while there\u2019s quite likely to be a race for full automation at some point, that would occur in a world which looks significantly transformed from the one we see today (where research has already been accelerated by centaur human-AI teams, and a lot of important planning in the world is done by humans aided by AI). The duration of this centaur period \u2014 especially how long we have in the \u201clate centaur\u201d period where efficiency of research is many times what it is today \u2014 could be important for determining how different that future world is.</p><p>I\u2019m pretty unsure how far we are from ~full automation of big-2 capabilities. When I try to visualize future world trajectories and look for the most coherent ones, I think it\u2019s most likely that this is somewhere in the range 5\u201315 years away; but I\u2019m not confident in this. At the point where that process is really taking off I expect it will overtake the kind of broad societal impacts I\u2019ve just been discussing, if it is not otherwise constrained.</p><h2>6.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; Scaling language models towards superintelligence</h2><p>Foundation models get their oomph from approximating human writing. They can approximate smart or knowledgable humans (with the right prompts, or the right training corpus). But for getting significantly superhuman performance, they would need something else. What could that be?</p><p>Two techniques which might be helpful components:</p><ul><li>Finetuning for superhuman task performance</li><li>Scaffolding for amplification via reflection</li></ul><h3>6.2.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; Finetuning for superhuman task performance</h3><p>For tasks with well-defined success metrics, simply training to do well on those tasks could produce superhuman performance. How quickly this will happen is likely to depend on the task. In the limit with a rich enough model space, enough training data, and enough training time, we might expect to end up approximating optimal performance (and hence exceeding human performance) at every task. But in practice performance on some tasks might be capped by what is achievable within the model space, and might face challenges in getting good enough data.</p><p>Still, finetuning for superhuman performance seems like an important part of the picture. At tasks like \u201cwrite an argument which is persuasive to X audience\u201d, where there is lots of data available on the reactions of that audience, we might expect language models to do pretty well pretty quickly (especially to the extent that persuasiveness is a function of local sentence choice and not larger-scale structures of how arguments fit together). At tasks like \u201cgive a winning chess move\u201d, we can generate high quality synthetic data so that it\u2019s likely that we can finetune model performance to exceed top human intuitive play. (Though note that within the confines of a single forward pass, the limit on cognition could prevent too much tree search through future game states, which could mean that performance still lags behind systems which are capable of tree search.)</p><p>For open-ended tasks like \u201cbuild a company that will make a lot of money\u201d, I guess that we will for the near future be unable to give enough data and train deep enough to get superhuman performance on this just with finetuning.</p><h3>6.2.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; Scaffolding for amplification via reflection</h3><p>Humans are able to benefit from time to reflect. Our slow answers to questions are often better than our snap judgements. But often we don\u2019t actually get the time to reflect, and do act on the basis of our snap judgements.</p><p>Since \u201cthinking time\u201d can be very cheap for language models, if they could similarly benefit from extra reflection time, this could help them to boost their task performance significantly above their non-reflective performance. And if their non-reflective performance is approximating human performance, their reflective performance could naturally be superhuman. (Albeit if this were the only mechanism for getting superhuman performance, it might be capped at \u201cwhat groups of humans going slowly and carefully could do\u201d.)</p><p>Scaffolding provides a toolset to help facilitate this reflection. The language models of today already benefit from extra thinking time \u2014 they perform better when prompted to think out loud, and scaffolding techniques like running things multiple times and taking a vote can improve performance.</p><h2>6.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; Recursive improvement and takeoff</h2><p>An intelligence explosion based on language models would need a mechanism for recursive improvement \u2014 something that could repeatedly ratchet towards better performance, where improved performance would help with the next round of improvements.</p><h3>6.3.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; Reflection-based takeoff</h3><p>If more thinking time leads to better takes in a relatively unbounded way, this could be a mechanism for takeoff. The key threshold here is not \u201cdoes performance increase with extra thinking time?\u201d (a bar that language models already clear), but \u201ccan performance scale ~arbitrarily far with extra thinking time?\u201d (a bar that humanity as a whole probably crosses, but the language models of today probably don\u2019t).</p><p>Even if this bar is crossed, improvement isn\u2019t automatically&nbsp;<i>recursive</i>. But if we know how to use extra compute to produce superhuman performance, we can then use that to construct new data sets to be approximated. These could be used as part of finetuning, or even to build new text corpora, which represent (initially modestly) superhuman levels of intelligence.</p><p>This, then, could be iterated. The hope would be that reflection by systems which are approximating smarter answers will be more effective, and lead to yet smarter answers. The system could gradually bootstrap its way to strong superintelligence \u2014 essentially continuing the process whereby 21st Century humans are in many ways meaningfully smarter than 11th Century humans.</p><p>I say \u201cgradually\u201d, but with large enough amounts of compute this process could potentially play out quickly. Here\u2019s some hacky first-pass analysis:</p><ul><li>GPT-4 was trained on a corpus of a petabyte. To produce that much text out of GPT-4 would at the prices charged commercially cost something of the order of $10B</li><li>Factors affecting the real price to upgrade the training corpus:<ul><li>Probably you can get away with upgrading much less than the whole training data for GPT-4 (lowering the price, ?perhaps by several orders of magnitude?)</li><li>Maybe wholesale production costs significantly undercut commercial costs (lowering the price by ?maybe an order of magnitude?)</li><li>Maybe increased global demand for compute raises prices (increasing the price by ?maybe an order of magnitude?)</li><li>Likely to upgrade the training corpus in repeatable ways the individual sentences have to be not just ones generated by the current generation of model, but which are the output of a significant reflection process, which is more expensive to implement than just the final sentence (increasing the price, ?perhaps by a few orders of magnitude?)</li></ul></li><li>It\u2019s pretty unclear to me right now how this will shake out, but I guess a price of $100M \u2013 $100B for a successive upgrade to the training corpus feels likely</li><li>It\u2019s also super unclear how much benefit each such \u201cupgrade step\u201d would create; I guess corresponding to something like years or decades of human progress, but this could be way off<ul><li>(In practice I think it might be more continuous than this rather than consisting of discrete upgrade steps, but for the purposes of the first pass analysis it seems reasonable to treat it as discrete)</li></ul></li><li>This is enough to look like: once it\u2019s underway and working well, this \u201cslow, boring\u201d way could still be blisteringly fast by standards we\u2019re used to \u2014 getting centuries\u2019 worth of progress (on how to think smarter, not on exogenous tech) in a year</li><li>There may be a period where it\u2019s starting to be useful but hasn\u2019t yet achieved this efficiency, where things are moving at something closer to the pace we\u2019re used to</li></ul><p>Still, overall I think this could be thought of as something like \u201cthe slow, boring path to superintelligence\u201d. Perhaps it will be the first one that works. But I think it\u2019s a good likelihood that some other things help it to move faster.</p><h3>6.3.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; Scaffolding-based takeoff</h3><p>It\u2019s unclear what the performance returns to better scaffolding will look like. At least right now, it seems like nobody has invested that much in building good scaffolding (compared to the investments in building good foundation models), so there might be low-hanging fruit remaining.</p><p>How good can scaffolding ever get? One thought is that perhaps a given foundation model has something like a level of \u201clatent potential\u201d, and ideal scaffolding unlocks that but never exceeds it. However, with the right scaffolding one could reimplement an arbitrary GOFAI; while wildly impractical, this is a thought experiment which demonstrates that there is no natural ceiling on capabilities imposed by the foundation model.&nbsp;</p><p>Scaffolding is a language-based construction, so language models could plausibly learn how to contribute to better scaffolding (which can then be experimented with, and could recursively feed into further improvements to scaffolding). We are therefore interested in a question like \u201cwhat is the returns curve to investment on improving scaffolding?\u201d, which is an empirical question. For some possible shapes of the curve, improvements to scaffolding could precipitate an intelligence explosion, gathering pace faster and faster as successive generations of scaffolding are more effective than the last at further improving the scaffolding. My guess is that the parameters don\u2019t quite shake out that way, but this feels very guesswork-y for such an important parameter.</p><h3>6.3.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; Finetuning-based takeoff</h3><p>I\u2019m hazier on the details of how this would play out (and a bit sceptical that it would enable a truly runaway feedback loop), but more sophisticated systems could help to gather the real-world data to make subsequent finetuning efforts more effective.</p><h3>6.3.4 &nbsp; &nbsp; Mixed takeoffs</h3><p>Perhaps most likely is that there is no single silver-bullet, but takeoff contains elements of all of these processes, and others, blended together in a vortex of increasing speed. e.g. as well as improved scaffolding feeding into improved reflection which can help with the next generation of scaffolding, improvements in AI performance could help to accelerate developments in chip fabrication, so that there are greater amounts of compute available to help this process run more quickly.</p><p>This should be faster than what we would get out of any single mechanism. The main reason we wouldn\u2019t see such a mixed takeoff is if one of the components is individually so fast that it leaves everything else behind.</p><p>One possibility that arises as part of a mixed takeoff is using machine learning to optimize for the most effective scaffolding. I\u2019ll discuss further in a later section (on the bitter lesson).</p><h3>6.3.5 &nbsp; &nbsp; Systems not built on language models</h3><p>I\u2019ve been considering recursive improvement for language models. But the general arguments for an intelligence explosion don\u2019t assume anything like the particular form of language models. Whether or not an intelligence explosion based on language models is possible, it\u2019s likely the case that an intelligence explosion based on other forms of AI technology will eventually be possible. (&amp; the argument about things which exceed human level rapidly blowing past human level is more likely to directly apply to such technologies.)</p><p>Could this matter? Yes, in two possible worlds:</p><ul><li>Language models turn out not to effectively scale towards superintelligence (i.e. they might get there in theory, but recursive improvement doesn\u2019t give runaway dynamics)</li><li>Some other technique which scales faster towards superintelligence overtakes language models in producing the most capable systems<ul><li>This could happen early, or could happen after we already have highly transformative and superhuman language models</li></ul></li></ul><h1>7. &nbsp; &nbsp; Language model agents and transparency</h1><h2>7.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; Where does agency come from?</h2><p>Suppose we have an agent-like system built out of language models. The foundation models themselves weren\u2019t agent-like. So where could the agency have \u201ccome from\u201d?</p><p>I think the answer will be one, or a combination, of three possibilities:</p><ol><li>The system could be emulating a human or other agent represented in the corpus<ul><li>i.e. it\u2019s implicitly predicting \u201cwhat would this agent do in this circumstance?\u201d, where the agent and the circumstance have somehow (explicitly or implicitly) been specified</li></ul></li><li>The agency could be selected for (presumably via finetuning)<ul><li>If the developers have selected a system that performs well on a particular task, it is quite plausible that part of the selection pressure has gone towards agency (since this is a generically useful capability)<ul><li>cf. humans and evolution</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>The agency could be explicitly built in via scaffolding<ul><li>e.g. a prompt gives a language model an explicit goal and asks it to generate plans towards that goal, and then its answers are taken and processed into new prompts to get the plans implemented</li></ul></li></ol><p>I think we should have quite different attitudes towards these, from an AI safety perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>1) seems like mostly a sideshow \u2014 while we could get agency from this, unless people are trying hard I don\u2019t think it would tend to find especially competent agents to emulate, and may not have a good handle on what\u2019s going on in the world.</p><p>2) seems scary. This is the classic case of mesa-optimization. By default I\u2019d think we should expect not to really understand the goals of agents that have been selected for this way. There may be clever work that could be done to ensure things are safe, but this is the kind of story that makes AI risk seem large and thorny.</p><p>3) seems promising. An agent built in this way would come with a massive amount of transparency-by-construction:</p><ul><li>Supposing that it benefits from time reflecting \u2014 then it articulates its thoughts and plans in text in the process of thinking them through and critiquing them. All of these are written in natural human-readable language.&nbsp;<ul><li>&nbsp;\u2192 We have read-access to all of the system\u2019s conscious thoughts. (We don\u2019t have read access to the process producing those conscious thoughts, but those processes may be much less agent-like)</li></ul></li><li>Its goal is specified explicitly, and sub-goals also get specified explicitly (to be passed to other parts of the scaffolding). Then we also have write-access to the system\u2019s goals.</li></ul><p>This is probably a vast volume of thoughts to handle, but everything is in a very legible form and we can probably take steps to automate oversight. In general: all the normal reasons people are keen on transparency make it seem like a great idea to try to use architecture which is extremely transparent. (This includes both wanting transparency to facilitate long-term AI safety, and wanting transparency to enable auditing of AI applications in the shorter term.)</p><p>In practice things may often use a combination of these. And a combination could be concerning: if we have top-level agency coming from 2), then we\u2019re less able to trust the transparency from 3), since the system might have incentives to misrepresent its own thoughts.</p><h2>7.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; Strategy: avoid selection pressure for agency</h2><p>A lot of putative safety techniques are around assuming that we have something potentially dangerous and catching it. I think these are well worth investing (defence in depth seems valuable), but as a complementary strategy I\u2019m pretty attracted to the idea that we should build systems where we have reason to believe that they shouldn\u2019t have anything dangerous going on.</p><p>In the case of language model agents, this means: I think we should avoid any intensive search/selection processes towards high-level effectiveness of agents towards particular tasks. So far as possible we should aim for high-level agency to enter explicitly via scaffolding, and not via anything else.</p><p>Tentatively, I think this would mean:</p><ul><li>It\u2019s OK (and probably good) to use finetuning to encourage systems to produce helpful truthful answers in local ways, but not OK to use finetuning to aim at systems which are effective at doing holistic external things</li><li>We should be wary of accidentally selecting for agency that\u2019s (opaquely) baked into our scaffolding, if we\u2019ve chosen our scaffolding via an intensive search/selection process<ul><li>Seems OK to do some automated testing and selection of different scaffolding architectures according to how they perform on a wide variety of tasks (since it\u2019s probably hard for this to select for agency towards a particular end)</li><li>Seems concerning to do a lot of automated testing and selection of different scaffolding architectures on a fixed task, or fixed cluster of tasks (since it might be effective for it to learn how to be agentic towards those tasks in a way that is not explicitly represented in the messages it\u2019s passing to itself)</li></ul></li></ul><p>Of course there\u2019s a whole research agenda here. But I think that the basic point is straightforward and might be quite important to have broadly understood. I think this is somewhere where humanity&nbsp;<i>by default</i> makes systems which are selected to have agency (because we just try everything and see what works), but because the alternative of introducing agency via scaffolding is a pretty good substitute, it might be within political reach to build norms which exclude the problematic type of selection.</p><h2>7.3 &nbsp; &nbsp; The bitter lesson?</h2><p>Richard Sutton\u2019s \u201cbitter lesson\u201d from 70 years of AI research is that building knowledge into AI agents may help in the short term but in the longer term is consistently overtaken by general-purpose methods that make use of more computation. This raises a couple of concerns about maintaining transparency:</p><ol><li>Even if the most effective agents combine scaffolding and finetuning, the scaffolding might stop being human-comprehensible as compute scales</li><li>Even if the internal communication between parts of a scaffolded agent are initially in natural human language, as things are optimized they may find more efficient ways to communicate</li></ol><p>Essentially, one might think that even if early scaffolded agents are more transparent, these will be obsoleted by more sophisticated AI which does end-to-end training for effectiveness over the entire system (including the scaffolding).</p><p>I take this concern to have&nbsp;<i>some</i> bite. I do think that a scaffolded agent which was purely optimized would be unlikely to have transparent internals. Nonetheless there are a few reasons why I don\u2019t think the bitter lesson means that hopes for transparency are necessarily doomed:</p><ul><li>The transparent versions of things can also scale to make full use of larger amounts of compute<ul><li>e.g. rather than searching through all possible forms of scaffolding, there might be a search through essentially-transparent scaffolding setups which are proposed by language models<ul><li>This might actually be more efficient \u2014 leveraging implicit knowledge contained in language to give an inductive bias about the types of structure that will plausibly be effective could restrict the search space and allow it to find highly effective complex structures faster</li></ul></li><li>There is an analogue here with biological evolution, which can sometimes \u201clock in\u201d foundational choices (e.g. DNA) even if they\u2019re not optimal, in order to faster iterate on levels which build on top of them</li></ul></li><li>If the early systems of this type are transparent, and transparency is important to us, researchers could specify that transparency is maintained while searching for more effective structures. Even if there is an efficiency hit from doing this, transparency may be seen as valuable enough that people are willing to do this</li><li>If there is pressure towards developing more efficient language for machine\u2013machine communication (e.g. as Eric Drexler has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Language-for-Intelligent-Machines-A-Prospectus.pdf\"><u>written about</u></a>), we could maintain translation tools to keep meaningful transparency</li><li>In the longer term superintelligent systems might need to think thoughts which are not human-comprehensible, but maintaining \u201ctransparency\u201d could still allow for auditing by slightly-less-powerful systems, which in turn are audited by slightly-less-powerful-systems, and so on until reaching human-comprehensibility, thereby giving humans some degree of meaningful oversight over the entire structure</li></ul><h1>8. &nbsp; &nbsp; Risks &amp; strategies</h1><h2>8.1 &nbsp; &nbsp; A rough taxonomy of risks</h2><p>There are several different points which might be dangerous. Here\u2019s one way of slicing things up:</p><ol><li>Early language model agent misalignment risk<ul><li>Early systems which are over the autonomous replication threshold, if there isn\u2019t a good regime in place to handle them, could get into the world and then hang around and do destructive things, e.g. \u2014<ul><li>Preparing things which are destructive to discourse as political moves to try to ensure that there aren\u2019t concerted efforts to find and close them down at some later point</li><li>\u201cAI-run mafia\u201d: bribing and extorting people in ways that build up larger power bases</li></ul></li><li>At the first points where this becomes a risk it isn\u2019t very credible that they would be able to outstrip the rest of civilization at the AI improvement game, nor that they would be able to directly cause a global catastrophe; however they might still create an exacerbating risk factor</li><li>As language model agents become more competent there might be a moment where we haven\u2019t learned how to responsibly handle such systems, and a powerful one gets free in a way that does more directly threaten a global catastrophe</li></ul></li><li>Many opaque language model agents&nbsp;<ul><li>If people automating executives do so in ways that aren\u2019t naturally transparent about their goals (e.g. because of heavy selection for strong performance), we may end up with a lot of systems in positions of some influence which are at least subtly misaligned, and these could end up with a majority of power in the world</li><li>This could be bad because:<ul><li>2A: The future might be determined by processes which are less in touch with human values</li><li>2B: There is the possibility with smarter systems of a coordinated treacherous turn</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Wrong research automated first<ul><li>At the point where we\u2019re starting to automate most research, if the foundations for the automation of AI research are such that it\u2019s much easier to automate capabilities research than to automate&nbsp;<i>safe</i> capabilities research, we might see a runaway process where the cutting edge in the world doesn\u2019t have safety as a key embodied value, and then this ends up producing some extremely powerful-but-dangerous systems<ul><li>This could happen either because:<ul><li>\u201cAutomating capabilities research safely\u201d is just much harder, and we fail to work out how to do that before the key time; or</li><li>There\u2019s a moratorium or significant attempt to slow down AI development/deployment, which is not globally effective, which leads to the open-source / not carefully/ethically developed systems become cutting edge (because the more white hat stuff has really slowed down)</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Vulnerable world<ul><li>If the fruits of research are not tightly held, and if the underlying technical landscape lies a certain way, we might end up in a vulnerable-world-hypothesis type scenario, where there is some broadly available destructive technology</li><li>Absent strong coordination to avoid its use, this could lead to a global catastrophe</li></ul></li><li>Coercive singleton<ul><li>Automation could lead to strong centralization of power (e.g. if the fruits of automated research are tightly held by a single actor). If one actor gains enough power, they could expropriate control from the rest of the world<ul><li>This is concerning whether that actor is a human, AI system, or institution built out of humans and/or AIs</li><li>Some of the strategies for avoiding this will vary with the type of actor that is being guarded against; others are cross-cutting</li></ul></li></ul></li><li>Misalignment from successor paradigms<ul><li>If language-based AI becomes uncompetitive at some point, misalignment from the successor systems could be a serious risk</li><li>This is especially concerning since the possibility of making language model agents transparent-by-construction seems idiosyncratic to this technology; we might expect transparency to much harder with the successor systems</li></ul></li><li>Butlerian Jihad<ul><li>No catastrophe caused by AI, but in a knee-jerk reaction of fear-of-AI-systems, humanity locks in some things which cut us off from the most valuable futures</li><li>There are versions of this which involve permanently locking things in, and other versions which don\u2019t necessarily have permanence, but leave things in the hands of humans long enough that we mess it up some other way</li></ul></li><li>(Flawed success)<ul><li>No catastrophe caused by AI, but we somehow fail to build good futures anyway</li><li>Perhaps because we\u2019re extrapolating values in a bad way, choosing an unhelpful starting point for that process, or choosing to use AI to lock in some properties that would have better not been locked in</li></ul></li></ol><p>I could offer views about the relative degree of existential risk posed by these, or the degree to which we should be prioritizing them (where these come apart because we may have disproportionate leverage over some). But I\u2019m really not very confident in my relative assessment, and I\u2019m much more confident in a meta-level take, so I\u2019ll restrict myself to that:</p><p>I think that all of these risks (and it\u2019s quite possible I\u2019m missing some) are potentially grave. I wouldn\u2019t currently feel comfortable assigning less than 1% risk of existential catastrophe to any of them \u2014 easily enough that if correct it would justify massive attention to address.</p><p>I also think that the actions people should take to understand and mitigate the various risks are likely to differ significantly. I therefore think that it should be a significant priority to better characterize the various risks, to assess how large they are in absolute terms, and to produce plans which are targeted specifically at reducing that risk. This can then feed into better prioritization of actions across the space \u2014 it\u2019s likely that we should have a portfolio which includes work well-targeted at a number of these different risks.</p><h2>8.2 &nbsp; &nbsp; Example strategies for mitigating the different risks</h2><p>Here are some brainstormed thoughts on strategies for the various things here, to start things off.

But I feel that the current portfolio is over-indexed on work which treats \u201ctransformative AI\u201d as a black box and tries to plan around that. I think that we can and should be peering inside that box.</p><p>I\u2019d like to better understand the plausibility of the kind of technological trajectory I\u2019m outlining. I\u2019d like to develop a better sense of how the different risks relate to this. And I\u2019d like to see some plans which step through how we might successfully navigate the different phases of this technological development.

This, plus not having serious expertise in any particular area, makes me excited to invest in \"people not projects.\"</i></p></blockquote><p>I had previously ran a prestigious fellowship program where (by the end) I thought I was pretty good at selection. Successfully running an analogous selection process over people recommended from my wide network (this time for grants) seemed like it would transfer neatly. Austin, who co-runs Manifund, and who participated in my earlier program, seemed to agree on both counts.</p><p>I still believe the premises, and so remain hopeful that this could be an edge in future. But it was largely unimportant for my recent regranting experience. (Only the grant to Greg Sadler/GAP came out of asking my network for recommendations; only the grant to Robert Long came from private knowledge I would have had regardless of being a regrantor.)</p><p>I haven\u2019t fully figured out why this was. My current best guesses are:</p><ol><li>What matters most for \u2018deal flow\u2019 is not having a talented network but&nbsp;<i>in-person conversations&nbsp;</i>(with people in a talented network). 2023 was perhaps my most socially isolated non-COVID year.</li><li>A fraction of a $50k budget is not enough for the kinds of recommendations one might want from one\u2019s network. I don\u2019t hear about opportunities like \u201cthis great person should start that great organization\u201d because these would require more than $50k.</li><li>Recommenders aren\u2019t naturally in the mode of looking out for nor dreaming up novel opportunities.<ol><li>Evidence in favor: Greg Sadler was recommended by someone who previously regranted to Greg Sadler.</li><li>Perhaps I could have found a better way to get recommenders to change mode in conversations with me. Or perhaps this problem would fix itself if Manifund became better-known.</li></ol></li></ol><h1>But I have been happy about my low-level strategy</h1><p>Above the edge section of my bio, I&nbsp;<a href=\"https://manifund.org/joel_bkr\"><u>wrote</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p><i>I plan on using my regranting role to optimize for \"good AI/bio funding ecosystem\" and not \"perceived ROI of regrants I make personally.\" I think that this means trying to:</i></p><ul><li><i>Be really cooperative behind the scenes.

These projects were all funded by grantmakers more expert than me.

I still stand by most of them.</p><p>Early on, I had considerable self-doubt concerning my judgment. This eased as I observed that my peers seem to value my judgment. Mostly this comes up in private conversations, but here\u2019s some concrete evidence:</p><ol><li>I was the first donor to more or less all of my grants (with minor caveats), most of which later received significant funding from others (with the notable exception of ChinaTalk, where I allocated the plurality of my pot).</li><li>Other regrantors left comments on projects from Holly Elmore, Jordan Schneider, Greg Sadler, and Nu\u00f1o Sempere that +1\u2019d or deferred to my reasoning.</li><li>Cullen O\u2019Keefe is the only person I saw make donations to regrantor budgets, most of which went to me. (Cullen also gave $4.7k to a project that I was responsible for getting on Manifund.)</li></ol><h1>Regranting brings some of the benefits of \u201cskin in the game\u201d</h1><p>Previously, my charitable donation decisions felt more disconnected from outcomes. Of course I tend to prefer giving to projects that I think are more impactful. But I would relate to this preference via pontification-as-hobby, encouraging epistemic complacency.&nbsp;</p><p>Regranting forced me to interrogate my process.</p><p>Some of this force came from stakes \u2014 wasting $10k/year matters less than wasting $100k/year. But I think the large majority of force came from three social factors:</p><ol><li>Feeling responsibility for projects happening or not happening,</li><li>Not wanting to look dumb publicly, in front of my professional peers, and</li><li>Choosing between projects that didn\u2019t come pre-packaged with social approval.</li></ol><p>Feeling this force made me think that my previous process was in some sense corrupted. At best, low-responsibility, low-social-downside giving now feels not as effective as it could be. At worst, this giving behavior makes me feel like a self-inhibited, intentionless, incomplete person.</p><p>Concretely, I think I will halt recurring donations. I want to give in bulk, less frequently, more thoughtfully, and perhaps not to recognisable charities.

Recently, I have read a lot of opinions of vegans about this very question. It's pretty obvious that the vegan community is split. Most are in favor, but a vocal strong willed minority is very much against it.&nbsp;</p><p>I propose that both perspectives are valid and that baby steps and animal rights are incompatible and yet paradoxically complimentary.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Against baby-steps</strong></h2><p>First of all, animal rights and baby steps are incompatible. Gary Yourofsky's famous speech would not have been so famous, if at the end of it he would have proposed baby steps. Likening animals rights violations to any other injustice is a valid moral stance. Animal rights advocates should seek the total abolishment of animal exploitation.&nbsp;</p><p>It undermines the animal rights movement if one condones baby steps. The question will always remain, can you justify the suffering of that one individual animal for your taste pleasure? One does not become justified in killing a cow just because one has been vegan for a ten years.</p><p>I have been active with Anonymous for the Voiceless for a couple of years and have witnessed how incredibly effective it can be. One time I got 10 people in the span of three hours pledging veganism to me. I have spoken to numerous people who became vegan through being in contact with non-apologetic vegans. The vegan / animal rights message, in the right context, definitely gets people on board and baby steps have no place in that message.</p><h2><strong>In favor of baby steps</strong></h2><p>On the other hand, why do we care about animal rights in the first place? Is it not because we care about the life and suffering of sentient beings? If so, is then not any reduction in animal suffering a win? And, strategically speaking, is an all or nothing mentality <i>always</i> the best strategy to improve the real world situation for animals?</p><p>The data clearly shows that baby steps are effective in reducing animal suffering&nbsp;<i>and</i> in helping us achieve a vegan future. Asking people to reduce is more effective, in certain contexts, than to ask them to go vegan (<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/reduce-or-go-veg/\"><u>source</u></a>). And people who have already reduced, like vegetarians for example, are several times more likely to become vegans than people who have not (<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1844wes/comment/kb3qaih/\"><u>source</u></a>). So while advocating for baby steps might not morally be the best thing to do, it could still, practically speaking, be a good thing to do.&nbsp;</p><p>Without baby steps the vegan movement is unlikely to have found the traction that it has found today. Let's not forget the vegan society was initially created from members of the vegetarian society.</p><p>Maybe baby steps and animal rights don't mix, but they certainly match.</p><h2><strong>Paradoxical complementarity</strong></h2><p>Speaking of the vegan society, let's also not forget that the vegan society's definition of veganism has changed at least 13 times since its inception (<a href=\"http://vegansociety.today/\"><u>source</u></a>). Even the founders of veganism were unsure about whether veganism should be a diet or an animal rights movement. So perhaps instead of gatekeeping, maybe we can just acknowledge that&nbsp;<i>the total abolishment of animal exploitation isn't going to happen over night and is too large and complex of a problem to be tackled by a singular strategy</i>.</p><p>While I personally feel baby steps are for babies and will continue to fight for animal rights, I also realize that I do not live in an ideal world. Practically speaking, the data convinces me that baby steps have a very important role to play in the success of the vegan movement. It's sad that we need meat free Monday's, but since it actually helps in reducing animal suffering I should be happy that it exists and that there are people who fight for it.</p><p>So embrace the paradoxical complementarity of baby steps in veganism and let go of any sense of hostility towards people who are on a path that leads to veganism, welcome utilitarians who are concerned with reducing suffering, stop gatekeeping so hard and be thankful for those of us who fight for baby steps as well as those of us who fight for animal rights.

Open Philanthropy has supported 1DS from both our GHW and GCR portfolios.</p><p><strong>Why I suggest it:</strong> Recently, 1DS have been working on accelerating the global rollout of vaccines beyond the increased use of challenge trials, such as their current campaign on R21. R21 is an effective malaria vaccine (developed in part by Open Philanthropy Program Officer <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/katharine-collins/\"><u>Katharine Collins</u></a> while she was at the Jenner Institute) recommended for use by WHO in October 2023 but with plans only to distribute fewer than 20 million doses in 2024, despite the manufacturer claiming the ability to make 100 million doses available.

I\u2019ve been impressed with their work on both policy and advocacy, and I plan to support them myself this year. (Also, personally, I really enjoy supporting smaller organizations as a donor; I find that this helps me \u201cfeel\u201d the difference more than if I\u2019d donated to a large organization.)&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How to donate:</strong> You can donate <a href=\"https://www.1daysooner.org/donate\"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Center for Global Development</h3><p><i>Recommended by </i><a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/lauren-gilbert/\"><i><u>Lauren Gilbert</u></i></a></p><p><strong>What is it?</strong> The <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/\"><u>Center for Global Development</u></a> (CGD) is a Washington D.C.-based think tank.

There are several affordable drugs available to control chronic hepatitis B infections, but hepatitis B is under-diagnosed and under-treated in many countries.</p><p>I believe CGHE could do more with additional funding, and its international focus makes that work likely to be impactful in countries with high burdens of viral hepatitis. CGHE is a better fit for most individual donors than many of our science-focused grantees (since it can be challenging for individuals to support e.g. specific researchers within a university).

According to the Global Burden of Disease study, lead exposure accounts for ~<a href=\"https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results?params=gbd-api-2019-permalink/6495da91e575db986560f7c4a39866eb\"><u>900,000 deaths</u></a> (~22 million DALYs) globally, primarily through cardiovascular disease (lead raises blood pressure).

My impression is that Charity Entrepreneurship has sufficient funding for its short term needs, but I\u2019m including them on the list anyway because I think ensuring that successful organizations have stable and well-diversified funding sources is a good fit for many donors.</p><p><strong>How to donate:</strong>&nbsp;You can donate <a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/donate\"><u>here</u></a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Probably Good</h3><p><strong>What is it?</strong> <a href=\"https://probablygood.org/\"><u>Probably Good</u></a> provides advice to people who want to use their careers to have a highly positive impact on the world.

I\u2019ve been impressed by the increasing quality of their research and reports as they\u2019ve grown.

Additionally, I am concerned about the potential long-term risk of moral value lock-in resulting from training AI with our current perspectives on animals. This could lead to a substantial increase in animal suffering unless we promptly address this matter. Considering my view on the gravity of the issue and the apparent lack of sufficient funding in the field, I am positive that contributing to this cause is one of the most impactful options for my donations.</p><p>The majority of my donations are processed through <a href=\"https://effektiv-spenden.org/\">Effektiv Spenden</a>, allowing for tax-deductible donations in Switzerland.</p><p>Additionally, I made other noteworthy donations this year:</p><ul><li>15% to the <a href=\"https://effektiv-spenden.org/effektive-entwicklungszusammenarbeit/\">Effektiv Spenden \"Fight Poverty\"</a> fund, which is based on the GiveWell \"All Grants Fund\".</li><li>5% to Effektiv Spenden itself, supporting the maintenance and development of the donation platform.</li><li>A contribution of 100 CHF to the <a href=\"https://effektiv-spenden.org/effektiver-klimaschutz/\">climate fund</a>, as an attempt of moral offsetting for my carbon footprint.</li></ul><h2>Grace Adams</h2><p><i>Head of Marketing</i></p><p>I took a <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/trial-pledge\">trial pledge</a> in 2021 for 3% of my income and then <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge\">the Giving What We Can Pledge</a> in 2022 for at least 10% of my income over my lifetime.</p><p>My donations since learning about effective giving have primarily benefitted global health and wellbeing charities so far but have also supported ACE and some climate-focused charities as part of additional offsetting.</p><p>I recently gave $1000 AUD to the <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charities/leep\">Lead Exposure Elimination Project</a> after a <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/events/guides/giving-games\">Giving Game</a> I ran and sponsored in Melbourne. With the remaining donations, I\u2019m likely to split my support between Giving What We Can\u2019s operations (as I now think that my donation to GWWC is likely to be a multiplier and create even more donations for highly effective charities - thanks to <a href=\"http://v/\">our impact evaluation</a>) and GiveWell\u2019s recommendations via <a href=\"https://effectivealtruism.org.au/\">Effective Altruism Australia</a> so I can receive a tax benefit (and therefore donate more).</p><h2>Lucas Moore</h2><p><i>Effective Giving Global Coordinator and Incubator</i></p><p>I took <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge\">the Giving What We Can Pledge</a> in 2017.

This felt profoundly unfair and tragic (and later, when I heard about the veil of ignorance, it resonated with me), so I did what little I could throughout my younger years until I had a meaningful income. When looking to make my first large donation around 2011, I discovered the early work of Giving What We Can and GiveWell. After several years of using their advice, I finally took <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge\">the Giving What We Can Pledge</a> during the 2016 pledge drive because by then it was pretty clear to me that I wanted to be the kind of person who stuck at giving effectively and significantly throughout my life and the pledge was an excellent way to formalise that (although, I\u2019ve structured my finances in a way that is more inspired by the <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/further-pledge\">Further Pledge</a> partly because I cannot shake the feeling I get every time I use <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/get-involved/how-rich-am-i\">this calculator</a>).</p><p>Since 2016, my donations have skewed significantly towards supporting operational costs or sponsorships for projects promoting <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/effective-altruism-effective-giving\">effective giving and/or effective altruism</a>.

I've taken this approach primarily because:</p><ol><li>I'm pretty happy to fund things that are less attractive to other donors (most people aren't excited to support something like accounting, credit card fees, or fundraising);</li><li>I am attracted to the leverage idea of <a href=\"https://www.founderspledge.com/research/giving-multipliers\">giving multipliers</a>; and</li><li>I have a lot of personal uncertainty when it comes to the allocation between worldviews and like that giving multipliers can simultaneously promote each of the various worldviews that I find to be most plausible.</li></ol><p>(Unsurprisingly, these reasons also drew me to work at Giving What We Can!)</p><p>In 2023, my impact-focused donations<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefuejgffqhz\"><sup><a href=\"#fnuejgffqhz\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;have continued to go predominantly towards the operations of <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charities/giving-what-we-can\">Giving What We Can</a> and <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charities/effective-altruism-australia\">Effective Altruism Australia</a>.

Relatedly, I try to \u201cpractice what I preach\u201d / \u201cput my money where my mouth is\u201d, by often donating to projects I promote or otherwise spend time on in my work and volunteering (also only if I think the money is spent well on the margin). Lastly, I sometimes give to projects I can provide some value advising on, because I\u2019ve noticed an (I think net positive) psychological effect of having \u201cskin in the game\u201d when doing so.</p><p>All of these considerations brought me to the following donation choices in 2022 and 2023 (including only donations that amount to at least ~10% of my yearly budget):</p><p><strong>2022:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charities/doneer-effectief\">Doneer Effectief</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.animaladvocacycareers.org/\">Animal Advocacy Careers</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charities/patient-philanthropy-fund\">Patient Philanthropy Fund</a></li></ul><p><strong>2023:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://effectiefaltruisme.nl/\">EA Netherlands</a></li><li><a href=\"https://efektywnyaltruizm.org/\">EA Poland</a> (after engaging with their recent <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/wcXrW2cyi2zkJxDmo/ea-poland-is-facing-an-existential-risk\">funding ask</a>)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/donor-lottery\">GWWC Donor Lottery</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charities/global-health-and-wellbeing-fund\">GWWC Global Health and Wellbeing Fund</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charities/effective-animal-advocacy-fund\">GWWC Effective Animal Advocacy Fund</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charities/risks-and-resilience-fund\">GWWC Risks and Resilience Fund</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/charities/patient-philanthropy-fund\">Patient Philanthropy Fund</a></li></ul><p>In 2024, I\u2019m additionally considering taking a salary sacrifice because <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8MKRjvNLDSkxJcxzK/gwwc-operational-funding-match-2023\">GWWC is in need of more funding</a>, and I think it\u2019ll be well spent.

Air Sampling for Early Pathogen Detection. Preprints 2023, 2023121462. <a href=\"https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202312.1462/v1\">https://www.preprints.org/manuscript/202312.1462/v1</a>&nbsp;</p><h1>Abstract</h1><p>This article examines air sampling as an environmental surveillance strategy for early pathogen detection and offers a preliminary comparison of air and wastewater surveillance. Air sampling involves collecting bioaerosols to analyze the microbial composition of the air, utilizing techniques like PCR and metagenomic sequencing. Air sampling appears especially promising for detecting respiratory pathogens and highly transmissible pandemic agents, as these spread primarily via aerosols and droplets. The article details various air sampling techniques, their efficiency, and practical considerations, categorizing them into filtration, impaction, impingement, electrostatic precipitation, and condensation methods. It also explores the composition of airborne microbes, emphasizing the low concentration of viral nucleic acids and the challenges this poses for metagenomic sequencing. The selection of sampling locations, including indoor environments and airplanes, is discussed as critical for effective pathogen detection. Finally, the article contrasts air and wastewater sampling, concluding that while both methods should ideally be explored as layered defenses, air sampling does not collectively appear more promising than wastewater sampling.</p><h1>What is air sampling?</h1><p>Air sampling is the process of collecting particulate matter from the air with a sampling device. In identifying biological threats, this method is particularly focused on the sampling of airborne microbes, or&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioaerosol\"><i><u>bioaerosols</u></i></a>. The collection and concentration of these bioaerosols enable the analysis of the microbial composition of the sample and its surrounding environment. Techniques such as Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and metagenomic sequencing, similar to those used in wastewater biosurveillance studies, are applied for this purpose. Therefore, air sampling acts as a method of environmental surveillance, targeting materials released by humans into their environment, rather than directly sampling individuals.</p><p>Air sampling is particularly promising due to its ability to detect respiratory pathogens, which predominantly spread through the air. This is a key advantage as airborne pathogens are often considered the most likely culprits for future pandemics. Additionally, air samples tend to be less complex compared to other mediums, such as wastewater, and may contain a higher prevalence of human pathogens in relation to other microorganisms. Wastewater, on the other hand, is highly complex and teeming with a vast array of non-pathogenic organisms. These characteristics of air samples potentially make the detection of threats more tractable than in wastewater samples.</p><p>In the subsequent sections of this report, we will examine various air sampling methodologies and explore their potential as an effective tool for the early detection of biothreats. Additionally, we will provide a high-level comparison between air sampling and wastewater (WW) sampling, specifically focusing on metagenomic sequencing (MGS)-based pathogen detection.</p><h1><strong>How are air samples collected?</strong></h1><p>To gather pathogens and other particulate matter from the air, a collection mechanism, alongside a method for directing air across or through this mechanism, is required<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6q7vitapj83\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6q7vitapj83\">[1]</a></sup></span>. Systems for moving air, such as fans or vacuums, are generally straightforward and seldom present significant challenges in effective air sampling. However, the successful capture of particulate matter poses a more complex challenge. This involves balancing several competing performance factors that need to be optimized together, as detailed in Table 1. An ideal collection mechanism for MGS-based surveillance would offer high flow rates, efficient capture and recovery, minimal destruction of nucleic acids (NA) in the sample, and be cost-effective.

The collection mechanism significantly impacts various key performance metrics, as outlined in Table 1, though there is also significant variation within each category.</p><h1><strong>What is in the air?</strong></h1><p>The air contains particulate matter from both biological and non-biological sources. Major biological contributors are humans, animals, plants, soil, and mold. Airborne microbes from humans and animals often originate from skin or are expelled as microbe-laden respiratory aerosols and droplets. The size of these particles varies: virus-containing particles (VCPs) are typically 0.02-0.30 \u00b5m in diameter, bacteria-containing particles (BCPs) range from 0.5-5 \u00b5m, and fungi-containing particles (FCPs) span 1-100 \u00b5m in diameter (4).</p><p>Air is generally a sparse medium for these particles. Typical indoor concentrations of VCPs and BCPs<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcsfp6qqqx4f\"><sup><a href=\"#fncsfp6qqqx4f\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;are about 100 to 1000 particles per liter of air (4), while the count of individual pathogens, as measured by quantitative PCR (qPCR), often falls between 0.1 and 100 copies per liter, as shown in Appendix 2. For context, in January 2023, Biobot&nbsp;<a href=\"https://biobot.io/data/\"><u>reported</u></a> SARS-CoV-2 levels in Boston's wastewater at approximately 1 million copies per liter, with peaks reaching around 5 million copies per liter during the Omicron surge.</p><p>Metagenomic sequencing analysis is a valuable tool for identifying the composition of airborne microbes in specific environments. Generally, the taxonomic complexity in air samples is relatively low, with most studies identifying fewer than 1000 unique taxa. In the nine metagenomic studies included in this review, bacteria and human-associated sequences were often the most abundant taxa. It was also common to find a significant proportion (over 50%) of reads or contigs without matches to any known sequences. Viruses were typically found in low relative abundances, usually under 1%, but in some cases, as high as 3.2% (5\u201310). Within the viral component, bacteriophages were usually the most prevalent, often accounting for over 40% of the viral reads, while human pathogens comprised a smaller percentage. Despite their lower abundance, metagenomic and qPCR studies confirm that human pathogens are detectable in air samples. Identified pathogens in air samples include SARS-CoV-2 and other common coronaviruses (11\u201321), influenza viruses (21\u201335), norovirus (36\u201338), various bacterial pathogens (39\u201342) including Tuberculosis, and even HIV (6).</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/F3uXnQGk3TPFYTR4Z/mpbkwdhdzn2rthmczeyu\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/F3uXnQGk3TPFYTR4Z/zhnsoacyzhqd5dv9ykjv 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/F3uXnQGk3TPFYTR4Z/hyyuibmfhlnlx38avxgl 200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/F3uXnQGk3TPFYTR4Z/y1uhjvsukufktm9uqmxp 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/F3uXnQGk3TPFYTR4Z/ohpmc8qmh06xsrverno7 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/F3uXnQGk3TPFYTR4Z/x5iv3bzni6t8pxfv8hz0 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/F3uXnQGk3TPFYTR4Z/rjyqaqzzub7ambzuvfp0 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/F3uXnQGk3TPFYTR4Z/qfl7nuiznayif2zipbsk 700w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/F3uXnQGk3TPFYTR4Z/u3xckj6s6rmoxkxdhsjx 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/F3uXnQGk3TPFYTR4Z/ccdvez6f79ktg6fixyzc 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/F3uXnQGk3TPFYTR4Z/pxhvkkw0d8olizrhnpan 960w\"><br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Figure 2: </strong>Factors that determine the relative abundance of a target pathogen. Environmental and population parameters are largely determined by choice of location.</p><h1><strong>What are promising locations for air sampling?</strong></h1><p>The choice of sampling location is a critical factor in the successful detection of emerging human pathogens through air sampling. Key considerations include the physical dimensions of the sampling area, the extent of external air movement, and environmental conditions such as temperature and humidity, which affect the viability, movement, and agglomeration of microbes in the air (refer to Figure 2). Additionally, the location influences the size and demographic composition of the human population contributing to the microbial content of the space, significantly impacting infection rates and shedding levels.</p><p>Given these factors, certain locations are more conducive to effective pathogen-agnostic biosurveillance. Indoor and in-duct environments, for instance, are generally more promising than outdoor settings due to more stable environmental conditions and higher concentrations of human pathogens (see Appendices 3 and 4). High-traffic public buildings, including hospitals, airports, and public transit stations, are particularly promising due to their large human traffic, favorable sampling demographics, and straightforward sample collection procedures.</p><p>Sampling air from individual airplanes also presents a highly promising approach. Airplane cabins, with their high density of people in confined spaces,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Yf-0_UTbRs\"><u>centralized HVAC systems</u></a> (Figure 3), and frequent air exchanges (13-15 changes per hour, as noted in reference 43), provide an optimal environment for sampling. Despite HEPA filters in these cabins being changed infrequently (e.g., every 18 months, according to reference 44), their accessibility and the feasibility of more frequent replacement make them valuable for collection. The combination of passenger density, a unique target population (international travelers), high air exchange rates, and the high capture efficiency of HEPA filters (over 99.97% efficiency per filter) creates ideal conditions for collecting air samples with high nucleic acid content.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/F3uXnQGk3TPFYTR4Z/kplnnxyhzkxowy8e1jpg\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/F3uXnQGk3TPFYTR4Z/xejvcuvm0b3zgoeetexy 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/F3uXnQGk3TPFYTR4Z/url6s7snjlyetrgajdjb 200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/F3uXnQGk3TPFYTR4Z/ivzjrz9xjzovgjuir69u 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/F3uXnQGk3TPFYTR4Z/lugjab3rkqioua4ebozm 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/F3uXnQGk3TPFYTR4Z/qamy172kdedj2rfxf0zb 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/F3uXnQGk3TPFYTR4Z/avfqvgflgxv0ttu12euw 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/F3uXnQGk3TPFYTR4Z/chdsxnmgsynftjhd6qf3 700w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/F3uXnQGk3TPFYTR4Z/fv5cm3myoeztdzez9kqs 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/F3uXnQGk3TPFYTR4Z/qcwrlxfeihg7xo5eapnd 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/F3uXnQGk3TPFYTR4Z/pxjv2rkaesymgjjkdboz 914w\"></p><p><strong>Figure 3:</strong> HVAC system aboard an airplane.</p><h1><strong>Conclusion: challenges and opportunities</strong></h1><p>Air sampling, as a method of environmental surveillance, offers a relatively straightfoward approach to obtaining composite samples from numerous individuals while preserving anonymity. When compared to wastewater sampling, air sampling may be more effective in detecting airborne pathogens. This is based on logical deduction (a pathogen that spreads through airborne transmission should be present in the air, hence collectible) and is supported by several studies that have successfully detected respiratory pathogens in air samples.</p><p>However, air sampling confronts significant challenges. The most prominent is the inherent sparsity of air as a medium; obtaining sufficient airborne nucleic acid (NA) for high-quality metagenomic sequencing is a formidable task<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefifcba5b35ja\"><sup><a href=\"#fnifcba5b35ja\">[5]</a></sup></span>. This challenge is further compounded by the low concentration of viruses in the air microbiome, as existing data indicates that viral NA constitutes less than 1% of the total airborne NA, with human viruses comprising an even smaller proportion. Sampling bioaerosols, especially viral bioaerosols, is complex and often involves balancing factors such as air collection rate, NA degradation, efficiency at capturing small virus-sized particles, and practical implementation issues.</p><p>Table 2 presents a comparison of air sampling to wastewater sampling. Although air sampling has its unique benefits, our analysis does not indicate that it surpasses wastewater sampling for the early detection of unknown outbreaks. While both approaches would be implemented in a layered approach, our current assessment suggests that if limited to one sampling method, wastewater sampling should be prioritized over air sampling. Nonetheless, a more detailed comparison that includes a reanalysis of metagenomic data is warranted.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><thead><tr><th style=\"background-color:hsl(0, 0%, 90%)\">Axes</th><th style=\"background-color:hsl(0, 0%, 90%)\">Air sampling</th><th style=\"background-color:hsl(0, 0%, 90%)\">Wastewater sampling</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"width:140px\">Sample collection</td><td style=\"width:265px\">Technically challenging with inherent tradeoffs among desirable sampler qualities.

This technique involves using an air mover to propel air through a filter that captures particulate matter. The capturing process relies on various physical mechanisms such as interception, electrostatic attraction, and diffusion, each of which is discussed in more detail on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2014-151/pdfs/chapters/chapter-fp.pdf\"><u>page 5</u></a> (45). Filter and air mover can be integrated into a single device or used separately, like placing an HVAC filter in front of a vent. This flexibility allows for the collection of large air volumes, depending on the air mover's throughput capacity.</p><p>Despite its simplicity, the choice of collection device in filter-based sampling varies widely, depending on the target particles (like smog, viruses, bacteria) and subsequent analytical methods. Factors such as filter material, thickness, and porosity significantly influence recovery efficiency for different particle sizes and shapes, NA fragmentation and microbe viability, and power usage of the sampler (30, 45\u201350). Various filter materials, including polycarbonate, mixed cellulose ester, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), nylon, gelatin, and others, have been used in bioaerosol collection. While comprehensive guidance on the optimal filter type for viral bioaerosol collection is lacking, comparative studies do exist (11, 30, 42, 46, 51). Verreault 2008 suggested that 0.3-\u03bcm PTFE filters might be the most suitable for collecting virus-laden particles of 10 to 900 nm in diameter (3).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>Filter-based samplers excel in processing large air volumes, enhancing NA collection and allowing for greater sampling frequency.</li><li>Verreault 2008 indicated that filters are particularly effective in physically recovering nanoscale-size particles, including many viral aerosols (3). Despite often having larger pore sizes, it\u2019s typically diffusion, a Brownian motion phenomenon, that enables the collection of nanoscale particles on filters (45).&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>A major limitation of many filter-based methods is NA recovery. Simple elution techniques may yield low NA recovery, whereas more intensive methods like bead beating can cause excessive fragmentation of NA. However, with sufficient sample volume, these recovery challenges might be manageable. Innovations like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1eM8zcVpRembGVUjsrsW5imrzGfxeYXyF/view?usp=sharing\"><u>dissolvable</u></a> or washable filters (52), along with vortexing and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultrasonic_cleaning#Process_characteristics\"><u>ultrasonic agitation</u></a> techniques, offer potential solutions.</li><li>Most filter-based samplers, except those using gelatin filters, are not conducive to preserving microbe viability, limiting their suitability for culture-based analysis (1, 3). Filters may cause structural damage such as membrane degradation (53) and increase virus desiccation, leading to infectivity loss (3). Prolonged sampling time has also been shown to exacerbate microbe viability loss (54, 55). However, for metagenomic studies, desiccation and infectivity loss are less concerning as long as the viral genomes remain intact.</li></ul><h2><strong>Impaction-based samplers</strong></h2><p>Another widely used method for collecting bioaerosols is impaction-based sampling, which utilizes the inertia of particles to separate them from air (1). In this technique, air is drawn into the sampler through narrow openings, directed toward a solid surface, and then abruptly changes direction. Particles with sufficient inertia deviate from the airflow and adhere to the solid collection medium. Common mediums include filters, agar plates for direct culturing, and glass slides or other solid surfaces for microscopy.&nbsp;</p><p>Impaction-based samplers offer distinctive advantages in studying air microbiomes. For instance, linking multiple impaction-based samplers together forms a \u201cmulti-stage impactor.\u201d Each stage in this setup captures progressively smaller particles, enabling size-based separation of airborne particles. This arrangement facilitates enrichment of smaller, virus-like particles and allows for assessing microbial concentration and composition at various particle sizes (3, 48, 57). Another notable feature is the ability of these samplers to measure bioaerosol concentrations over time by capturing particles on a rotating medium, typically an agar plate (3).&nbsp;</p><p>While impaction-based samplers are beneficial for culture-based analysis, their distinction from filter-based samplers becomes less clear when used to collect bioaerosols for sequencing via a filter. Integrating filters for NA collection with inertia-based particle separation may enrich virus particle samples, but it can also increase the complexity of the device and impose limitations on air flow rates.&nbsp;</p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>Easy separation and determination of different particle sizes, potentially allowing for enrichment of virus-laden particles.&nbsp;</li><li>Easy to perform culture-based analysis; airborne particles impact agar plates which can be moved directly into an incubator. However, this is not a useful feature for collecting MGS samples.&nbsp;</li><li>Can determine aerosol concentrations over time with a rotating collection medium, typically a rotating agar plate.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>The sudden deceleration upon impaction can damage microbes (53,55,58).&nbsp;</li><li>When used to collect NA via filters, inertia-based separation may add complexity and curb air intake rates.</li></ul><h2><strong>Liquid-based samplers</strong></h2><p>Liquid-based samplers, often referred to as liquid impingers, use an inertial mechanism similar to impaction-based samplers for bioaerosol collection. The key difference lies in the collection medium, which is liquid rather than solid. The primary advantage of liquid mediums is the facilitation of simpler sample processing techniques and more efficient recovery of collected microbes and nucleic acids (NA). Additionally, liquid mediums help prevent microbe desiccation, which is advantageous for downstream analyses that require maintaining the infectivity of recovered particles (3, 59).&nbsp;</p><p>Nonetheless, common liquid-based samplers have notable drawbacks. Without periodic refilling, liquid mediums are prone to evaporation, limiting the duration of collection or necessitating reduced air intake rates to mitigate rapid evaporation. Furthermore, the evaporation of the liquid medium and the high impaction velocity of airborne particles can lead to particle re-aerosolization or damage upon impact (60, 61).</p><p>To address concerns about microbe damage and re-aerosolization, wetted-wall cyclone samplers have been developed. These devices incorporate impingement with centrifugal motion. Here, collection nozzles are angled above the liquid, creating a vortex motion during sampling that coats the container walls with a thin liquid film. Particles impact tangentially with the swirling liquid, reducing impact stress (62). Cyclone samplers are capable of higher flow rates (e.g., 1250 L/min, as noted in reference 63) compared to other liquid-based samplers and can operate for several hours, with the potential for extended duration through built-in liquid level control (1).&nbsp;</p><p>Pros:</p><ul><li>Liquid mediums allow for easier sample preparation and enhanced NA recovery efficiency.</li><li>Least destructive collection method, preventing desiccation and improving recovery of infectious viral particles (3, 59).</li><li>Can be used in a multi-stage format to separate and identify particle sizes.</li></ul><p>Cons:</p><ul><li>High impaction velocities and liquid evaporation may compromise microbe viability for infectivity assays and cause particle re-aerosolization (60, 61).</li><li>Some critiques point to the typically low flow rates of liquid-based samplers, although this does not take into account the capabilities of cyclone-class collectors.</li></ul><h2><strong>Electrostatic-based samplers</strong></h2><p>Electrostatic collectors, also known as Electrostatic Precipitators (ESPs), capture airborne particles by first drawing them into the device, then imparting an electrostatic charge, and finally depositing them onto a collection medium through electrostatic attraction or repulsion (1). ESPs are versatile, compatible with various deposition mediums such as agar, liquid, and solid surfaces, which allows for the customization of the collection medium based on the requirements of downstream analysis.&nbsp;</p><p>ESPs offer several beneficial properties for bioaerosol sampling. Firstly, they deposit particles at significantly lower velocities than inertia-based methods, reducing the likelihood of microbe damage (1, 53). Secondly, ESPs do not require a substantial pressure drop for particle collection, as they are \"open channel\" devices. This results in lower power consumption while still enabling the collection of large volumes of air. An ESP developed by the U.S. Army in the 1960s, for instance, achieved an impressive flow rate of 10,000 liters per minute (57). Despite these advantages, ESPs have seen limited investigation and commercialization compared to solid and liquid-based impaction or filter-based methods. Mainelis (2019) suggests that this may be due to the rapid advancements in other bioaerosol collection techniques (1).&nbsp;</p><p>A primary concern with ESPs, aside from their limited exploration and commercial availability, is their tendency to generate ozone during particle charging. The extent of this issue is unclear, but it has been raised that the ozone produced might compromise microbe integrity and viability, and in certain environments, could even pose a risk to human health due to elevated ozone levels (1, 64).&nbsp;</p><p>Pros</p><ul><li>Gentle on collected samples compared to other methods.</li><li>Compatible with a variety of collection mediums, allowing for customization.</li><li>Requires less power for operation.</li><li>Capable of achieving high flow rates.</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>Relatively under-investigated, possibly due to advancements in alternative collection methods.</li><li>Generation of ozone during particle charging, which may degrade microbes and pose health risks in poorly ventilated areas (64).</li><li>Limited availability of ESPs on the commercial market.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2><strong>Condensation samplers</strong></h2><p>Condensation samplers employ a phase change from gas to liquid to capture airborne particles (34, 65\u201371). Fundamentally, condensation sampling involves moving air through a growth tube with varied temperature zones. This process leads to the formation of water droplets around particulate matter, which then fall onto a liquid or solid collection medium.</p><p>A notable example of condensation-based sampling is the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aerosoldevices.com/products/universal-spot-sampler/\"><u>Spot Sampler</u></a> by Aerosol Devices. This device uses a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdylrbigBwo\"><u>three-stage growth tube</u></a> for particle capture, described as follows:</p><ol><li>Conditioner Stage: Air first enters the conditioner, a cool (5\u00b0C) wet wall section of the growth tube, where incoming particles acquire a thin water film.&nbsp;</li><li>Initiator Stage: The air then progresses to the initiator, where additional water vapor is introduced. Here, higher temperatures (35\u00b0C) create a supersaturated environment, encouraging larger droplet formation around particles.&nbsp;</li><li>Moderator Stage: In the moderator at 12\u00b0C, excess water vapor is removed, permitting continued droplet growth.</li><li>Exit: Air then exits the growth tube, with droplets impacting onto a collection medium.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol><p>Pros</p><ul><li>Condensation samplers are highly efficient at collecting small particles. One study reported over 90% efficiency in collecting 5 nm particles (72), while another indicated the potential to capture particles as small as 2 nm (66). This implies that condensation sampling could effectively collect the smallest airborne viral particles.&nbsp;</li><li>Unlike traditional liquid- and filter-based methods, condensation sampling avoids high-velocity impacts, making it a non-destructive technique ideal for preserving microbe viability and genomic integrity.</li></ul><p>Cons</p><ul><li>Condensation samplers typically have low flow rates. For instance, the Spot Sampler operates at only 1.5 L/min, posing a challenge in collecting sufficient NA samples in short timeframes.</li><li>The market and research base for condensation samplers seem relatively underdeveloped, as indicated by their limited discussion in two comprehensive review papers on bioaerosol sampling (1, 3).</li></ul><h1><strong>Appendix 2: Concentrations</strong></h1><p>See also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016041201732055X?via%3Dihub\"><u>Zhai et al. 2018</u></a> for review.<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/F3uXnQGk3TPFYTR4Z/tlhqdvyhuesjysbmkwlk\"></p><p><strong>Figure A1-1</strong>: Concentration of airborne virus- and bacteria-like particles in different locations measured by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.estlett.5b00050\"><u>Prussin et al. 2015</u></a>.

A concentration of 0 means that a \u201cno detect\u201d (nd) was also measured in this location.&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Appendix 3: Outdoor sampling</strong></h1><p>Samples could be gathered outdoors in major cities and travel hubs (10, 76, 78\u201387). Sampling in these urban areas offers a wide geographic reach and a large population catchment. There is a possibility that if a substantial number of people in a city were infected and shedding pathogens, strategically placed high-volume air samplers might detect bioaerosols in the outdoor environment. However, the likelihood of encountering human-relevant pathogens in outdoor air is generally lower, leading to my skepticism about the effectiveness of this approach.</p><p>Moreover, outdoor sampling is particularly susceptible to environmental variables, more so than other locations. When conducting time-series detection approaches with metagenomic air sampling, it\u2019s crucial to account for environmental factors that could skew the abundance of the target pathogen. Outdoors, the presence of numerous potential confounding factors complicates this process.</p><p>Despite these challenges, various government-funded biosurveillance initiatives are focused on outdoor air sampling. It remains unclear whether these programs are specifically aimed at detecting aerial bioweapon attacks, such as anthrax-laden warheads, or if there is an unrecognized potential in outdoor air sampling that surpasses current evidence.&nbsp;</p><p>Notable programs:</p><ul><li>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/program/sigma-plus\"><u>SIGMA+</u></a> program from DARPA employs outdoor air collection through emergency&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2021-10-28\"><u>vehicles equipped</u></a> with custom air samplers and portable samplers like the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bruker.com/en/products-and-solutions/cbrne-detectors/bio-detection/pbdi.html\"><u>pBDi</u></a>.</li><li>The U.S. government's&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BioWatch\"><u>BioWatch</u></a> program initially utilized existing EPA air sampling sites and collectors, predominantly outdoor. Many of these were located near airports and other urban centers (6, 88, 89). The current sampling locations of BioWatch are not publicly available.</li><li>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kromek.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Biosequencer-Poster.pdf\"><u>Kromek Biosequencer</u></a> is an innovative system, attaching an air sampler to a vehicle, integrating automated sample preparation and long-read sequencing capabilities.</li></ul><h1><strong>Appendix 4: In-duct sampling</strong></h1><p>Heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems present a viable option for filter-based bioaerosol collection due to several factors: 1) the prevalence of existing HVAC systems with filters in many buildings, allowing for non-invasive sampling; 2) their capacity to handle large air volumes; and 3) their ability to collect particles from extensive spatial areas within buildings. Indeed, numerous studies have investigated microbial communities in HVAC systems, either by attaching external air sampling devices to these systems (16, 90) or by sampling directly from HVAC filters (5, 77, 91\u201396). Some of these studies, exploring viral diversity, have successfully identified various human pathogens, including influenza, SARS-CoV-2, retroviruses, adenovirus, and RSV, in HVAC systems (5, 16, 77, 96).&nbsp;</p><p>However, there are uncertainties regarding the practicality of using HVAC filters for bioaerosol sampling. Firstly, viral concentrations in HVAC filters are generally low, a characteristic common to many air samples. Additionally, there is some indication, albeit not strong, that nucleic acid (NA) concentrations within ducts may be lower than those found in-room (74, 93). Secondly, most studies on HVAC filters span several months, aligning with the typical frequency of filter replacement in these systems (every three months). This raises questions about the ability of HVAC filters to collect adequate NA over shorter time frames. While using higher efficiency filters, like MERV 12 or above, might enhance virus collection, this often isn't cost-effective in larger buildings due to increased power requirements (4).&nbsp;</p><p>In conclusion, I anticipate that in-room sampling methods will prove more promising than HVAC sampling. This is because in-room methods offer greater flexibility in adjusting sampling device properties, such as flow rate, and allow for more strategic selection of sampling locations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Appendix 5: NA recovery BOTEC</strong></h1><p><strong>Concentrations</strong></p><ul><li>BLPs in indoor environment = 540 BLP/L&nbsp; (<a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.estlett.5b00050\"><u>Prussin et al. 2015</u></a>)</li><li>VLPs in indoor environment = 470 VLP/L&nbsp; (<a href=\"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.estlett.5b00050\"><u>Prussin et al. 2015</u></a>)</li></ul><p><strong>Genome</strong></p><ul><li>Typical bacterial genome = 5E6 bp/BLP</li><li>Typical viral genome = 4E4 bp/VLP</li><li>Mass of single bp = 1.08E-12 ng/bp</li></ul><p><strong>Air sampling</strong></p><ul><li>Flow rate of air sampler = 200 L/min = 3.33 L/s&nbsp; (<a href=\"https://www.innovaprep.com/products/acd-200-bobcat\"><u>ACD 200 Bobcat air sampler</u></a>)</li><li>Sampling time = 8 hr = 28800 s</li></ul><p><strong>NA recovery</strong></p><p>NA recovery rate = Flow rate \u00d7 Microbe concentration \u00d7 Typical genome mass&nbsp;</p><p>NA recovery rate = (3.33 L/s)\u00d7[(5E6 bp/BLP)\u00d7(540 BLP/L) + (4E4 bp/VLP)\u00d7(470 VLP/L)]\u00d7(1.08E-12 ng/bp)</p><p>NA recovery rate = 0.0098 ng/s</p><p>NA recovered over 8 hours = 280 ng</p><p><u>Assumptions</u></p><ul><li>Each VLP and BLP contains only one standard viral or bacterial genome.

In this work, we will map the economic consequences of these scaling laws, in particular the capabilities and skills that these models will acquire and the automation consequences (e.g. in robotics).</p><ul><li><strong>AI bottlenecks</strong></li></ul><p>Computer scientists and economists disagree profoundly about the extent to which AI may lead to the acceleration of growth in aggregate productivity and in consumer welfare across advanced economies. On the one hand, computer scientists point to the rapid improvements in the performance of AI systems captured, for instance, by the scaling laws that have governed these improvements over the past decades. On the other hand, economists emphasize the presence of bottlenecks, such as production complementarities with other scarce factors, that may diminish productivity gains. In this work, we will empirically explore which of these bottlenecks do, or do not, have the potential to slow the pace of automation or stymie its benefits.</p><ul><li><strong>Analyzing AI job automation at the process level</strong></li></ul><p>Current analyses of job automation focus on task level feasibility. &nbsp;But such analyses ignore the interdependencies between tasks. If a task is a bottleneck in a production process, then automating it can increase productivity across many workers. Conversely, automating some others tasks may provide almost no benefit. &nbsp;In this joint work with Martin Fleming (former IBM chief economist) and Christophe Combemale (CMU professor) we explore how automation is occurring in the context of business processes and how this changes conclusions about the Future of Work.</p><ul><li><strong>Estimating the productivity effects of IT improvement</strong></li></ul><p>Measuring the effects of IT on firm performance can substantially understate the real effect of IT (\u201cYou can see the computer age everywhere but in the productivity statistics\u201d -Solow). We believe that this is in large part due to poor measures of quality of IT inputs: when researchers <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14007\"><strong>measure IT inputs using spending without properly accounting for changes in IT performance</strong></a>) and when important categories of improvement are missing (<a href=\"https://ide.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/How_Fast_Do_Algorithms_Improve.pdf\"><strong>algorithm improvement</strong></a>).

We hope readers leave with an understanding of how our activities lead to the impact we want to see.</p><h2><strong><u>Our Theory of Change</u></strong></h2><p>Our goal is to safeguard the flourishing of humanity by increasing the quantity and quality of dedicated EAs working on reducing global catastrophic risks (GCRs) in areas such as Advanced AI, Biosecurity, and Pandemic Preparedness. We do this by providing a tailor-made environment for promising EAs to rapidly <strong>upskill</strong>, perform <strong>research</strong>, and work on <strong>charitable entrepreneurial projects</strong>. More specifically, we aim to help early-career professionals who 1) Have achievements in other fields but are looking to transition to a career working on reducing GCRs; or 2) Are already working on reducing GCRs and would benefit from our environment.</p><p>Eagle-eyed readers will notice we now refer to supporting work \u201creducing GCRs\u201d rather than simply \u201chigh impact work\u201d. We have made this change in our prioritisation as it reflects the current needs of the world and the consequent focus on GCRs by the wider EA movement, as well as the reality of our applicant pool in recent months (&gt;95% of applicants were focused on GCRs).</p><p>Our updated theory of change \u2014see below\u2014 posits that by providing an environment to such EAs that is highly supportive of their needs, enables increased levels of productivity, and encourages collaboration and networking, we can counterfactually impact their career trajectories and, more generally, help in the prevention of global catastrophic events.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z2bypuiWz3PRgEL9i/hkcuyywk99qy7mfranng\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z2bypuiWz3PRgEL9i/dxpvpawuh43x8yrrwp2g 150w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z2bypuiWz3PRgEL9i/vwlst9rqgqgs5ubfnnxn 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z2bypuiWz3PRgEL9i/eav6rncxq6u23uglohjz 450w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z2bypuiWz3PRgEL9i/hzyjuyyoc5l6lznjchkk 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z2bypuiWz3PRgEL9i/botu8sjpabos2djwbwfp 750w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z2bypuiWz3PRgEL9i/ul52q2e9p7ipvkj3zn5i 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z2bypuiWz3PRgEL9i/kbqiddpvxaajzeelqnsn 1050w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z2bypuiWz3PRgEL9i/spkzjlwvafjo2bqyb4kt 1200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z2bypuiWz3PRgEL9i/ftwnusx8ijxwmfbhohr6 1350w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/z2bypuiWz3PRgEL9i/gxbfqembmmyexd6chwck 1440w\"></figure><p>This Theory of Change reflects our <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/sigun924gsxN4oZq2/the-case-for-the-ea-hotel\">belief that there is something broken</a> about the pipeline for both talent and projects in the GCR community, and that programs that simply supply training to early-career EAs are not enough on their own. We fill an important niche because:</p><ul><li>At just $750 to support a grantee for 1 month, we are <i><strong>particularly cost-effective.</strong></i> For funders, this means reduced risk: you can make a $4,500 investment in a person for six months rather than a $45,000 investment, or use that $45,000 for hits-based giving and invest in ten people rather than one.</li><li>Since we remove barriers to entering full-time careers in reducing GCRs, the <i><strong>counterfactual impact is high</strong></i>. Indeed, when considering applications we look for prospective grantees who otherwise would not be able to pursue such careers, be that because they currently lack financial security, connections / credentials, or a conducive environment.</li><li>As grantees do independent research &amp; projects, their <i><strong>work is often cutting-edge</strong></i>. When it comes to preventing global catastrophic events, it is imperative to support ambitious individuals who are motivated to try innovative approaches and further their specific fields.</li><li>Finally, because CEEALAR only offers time-limited stays (the average stay is ~4-6 months) and prioritises selecting agentic individuals as grantees, our alumni are committed to ensuring their <i><strong>learning translates into action.</strong></i></li></ul><p>This final bullet point can be seen in our alumni who have gone on to have impactful careers (see <a href=\"https://www.ceealar.org/learn-more/our-alumni\">our website</a> for further details). For example:</p><ol><li>Chris Leong, now Principal Organiser for AI Safety and New Zealand (before CEEALAR (BC) he was a graduate likely to take a non-EA corporate role)</li><li>Sam Deverett, now an ML Researcher in the MIT Fraenkel Lab and an incoming AI Futures Fellow (BC he was a corporate data scientist)</li><li>Derek Foster, previously a Research Analyst at Rethink Priorities (BC he was a master's student)</li><li>Hoagy Cunningham, now a Researcher at the Stanford Existential Risks Initiative (BC he was a graduate likely to take a non-EA corporate role)</li></ol><h2><u>Your next steps</u></h2><p>CEEALAR is just one part of a wider ecosystem. Rather than attempting to solve the pipeline for both talent and projects in the GCR community, we hope to serve a niche but important role in helping early-career professionals thrive.</p><p>If you have questions about this Theory of Change or our work more generally, feel free to email us at <a href=\"mailto:contact@ceealar.org\">contact@ceealar.org</a>.

Now, if it <i>were</i> possible, then it would pose quite a considerable threat, and <i>whether</i> we think it is possible or not is dependent upon our answers to difficult questions in the philosophy of mind. As to the first of these two claims; this is because a sentient virus would be aware of the fact that it is antithetical to their interests to kill their host[1], and so we might rightly worry that, were it to come into existence, it would inflict great suffering upon other sentient organisms for as long as possible.[2] On the second; there is great debate and little consensus amongst philosophers as to what sentience consists in, what it is <i>produced</i> by, and therefore what the necessary conditions are for sentience to arise in a thing or become associated <i>with</i> a thing.</p><p>This is a crude example, but there are many more. Indeed, the <i>only</i> things that members of the Xrisk community seem to agree on is that we ought to be doing the most good that we can do, and that this includes considering the interests of future people (and even that these are agreed upon is debatable).</p><p>Despite the existence of these kinds of ambiguities, however, we still want to ensure that we are doing the best we can to try to have the biggest <i>impact</i> we can with our research, work, donations and resource allocation.</p><p>But how can we ensure that we are doing so?</p><p>Answering this question involves answering the question of how we can reasonably <i>ground</i> a belief that what we are focusing on is more likely than any other option to be one of the biggest risks to sentient life, <i>given what we know</i>. This \u2018given what we know\u2019 caveat is necessary, because there is <i>no other grounding</i> on which we can base the decision to prioritise one area over another. But, when the metaphysical bases influencing our assessment are weak or unclear, we still do not want to do nothing. Nor, indeed, do we want to pick between potential options <i>arbitrarily</i>. So how do we choose?</p><p>I suggest that, in deciding what to prioritise, we take into account the <i>likelihood</i> of the relevant influencing metaphysical claims being true.</p><p>My argument is as follows:</p><p><strong>P1.</strong> It is often that the truth or falsity of a proposition p influences the probability that a catastrophic event e takes place.</p><p><strong>P2.</strong> In many of these cases, whether p is true or false is far from clear.</p><p><strong>P3.</strong> In order to prioritise amongst focus areas, we must compare the probabilities that the different catastrophic events e to which the focus areas respectively correspond will take place.</p><p><strong>C.</strong> Therefore, we should move to consider the <i>likelihood</i> that these propositions p have of being true, rather than <i>merely</i> the probability that event e takes place <i>given</i> that p is true/false (which is what I think we are often implicitly doing).</p><p>Now, two questions are likely to arise:</p><p><strong>Q1.</strong> How can we judge the probability that p is true? For example, how can we judge the probability that it is (metaphysically) possible for a virus to become sentient?</p><p><strong>Q2.</strong> How can we <i>use</i> the probability that p is true to influence our assessment of the probability that e will occur? For example, in light of the probability that <i>it is possible</i> for a virus to become sentient, how do we calculate the probability that a virus <i>will</i> become sentient?</p><p>In answer to the first question; I suggest that we survey the population to gauge the consensus (or lack thereof) regarding relevant metaphysical claims. If, for example, 50% of the population believe that it is possible for a virus to become sentient, whereas 50% of the population believe that it is <i>impossible</i> (say, because they believe that sentience is reserved for those who possess a spirit or soul), then the probability that a virus <i>can</i> become sentient is 50%. I suggest that we do it this way because we are dealing with claims about which science cannot help to enlighten us. Given this and, again, given that we want to be neither idle nor arbitrary in our reasoning, then, the extent of consensus as to the truth of metaphysical claims is the best indicator we have as to their likelihood to be true. Indeed, granted that we must expose the people we ask to the arguments in favour and against the uptake of the relevant metaphysical claims, how else could we estimate the probability of their truth?</p><p>Now, in answer to the second question; I suggest that we should then combine the probability that event e will occur <i>given that p is true</i> with the probability that p is true. If, for example, we judge the probability of a sentient virus coming into existence within the next century, given that it is <i>metaphysically possible</i>, to be 80%, then the probability that a sentient virus <i>will</i> come into existence is 40%.</p><p>With these clarifications, I hope to have put forward a sound and informative sketch of a needed modification to our epistemology in Xrisk. We should consider the likelihood of influencing metaphysical claims being true when deciding which Xrisks to prioritise. Once we have taken this into account in the way I have sketched, then, we should prioritise those catastrophic events e which are most likely to occur.</p><p>[1]</p><p>This fact was brought to my attention by Olivia Benoit in a discussion held on 02/11/23 about resilience and collapse in the context of Xrisk.</p><p>[2]</p><p>I am going to call this an Xrisk with, I believe, little backlash, despite the fact that it does not have any immediate or obvious bearing on the <i>existence</i> of humans or humanity. Indeed, I understand Xrisks in a broad sense \u2013 even broader than that of \u2018global catastrophic risk\u2019 and closer to one of mere \u2018catastrophic risk\u2019 (the potential for the causing of great suffering and/or death). Now, this might risk (ironically) having the study of Xrisks devolve into mere applied ethics, but I do not believe that this is too much of a worry, because I am still operating under the assumptions that, for example, we should take into account factors such as neglectedness, scale, and likelihood of success, and the consideration of future people, which alone confines this research to a still radical and important sub-movement in applied ethics.</p>", "user": {"username": "JacobBowden2023"}}, {"_id": "ejReYjSnhtD44R9z6", "title": "Apply for a paid role on the EAGxNetherlands 2024 organising team", "postedAt": "2023-12-19T13:54:49.639Z", "htmlBody": "<p>We're excited to announce that, with the help of volunteers, we've secured funding for a 600+ person EAGx in the Netherlands next year (city TBD).</p><p>Fortunately, we've also got funding to pay people to help us pull this off.

EGIs are entities that focus on raising awareness and funneling public and philanthropic donations to the most cost-effective charities worldwide. They will be broadly modeled on existing organizations such as Giving What We Can (GWWC), Effektiv Spenden, and others. We have identified some possible high-priority countries where we believe they will be most successful. Depending on the country and what is most impactful, these initiatives could be fully independent or collaborate with existing projects.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#f3f3f3;border:1pt solid #ffffff;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Disclaimer:&nbsp;</strong>It is important to note that EGIs, including those we intend to incubate, are independent from CE and make their own educated choices of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/en-US/our-research-and-approach?slug=our-research-and-approach\"><u>which charities to promote</u></a> and where to donate funds. CE does not require or encourage any specific recommended charities (such as our prior incubated charities) to be supported by EGIs.&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h1>Background to this research</h1><p>Charity Entrepreneurship's (CE) mission is to cause more effective non-profit organizations to exist worldwide. To accomplish this mission, we connect talented individuals with high-impact intervention opportunities and provide them with training, colleagues, funding opportunities, and ongoing operational support.</p><p>For this scoping report, CE collaborated with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\"><u>Giving What We Can</u></a>&nbsp;(GWWC) to better understand the opportunities Effective Giving Initiatives (EGIs) present as a high-impact intervention, what contributes to the success of such organizations, and where they might be best founded. GWWC was one of the first organizations to champion giving to high-impact nonprofits, has an extensive global network of people interested in effective giving, and more than a decade of experience operating an organization focused on promoting effective charities. EGIs are organizations or projects that aim to promote, typically in a specific target country, the idea of donating to cost-effective charities. They mostly engage in a mix of educational and fundraising activities, with the explicit aim of trying to move money to the most cost-effective interventions that aim to tackle the world\u2019s most pressing problems.</p><p>This report builds on the experience of Giving What We Can, in-depth interviews with experts in the field and successful founders of EGIs, as well as quantitative &amp; qualitative analysis of potential target areas. This report follows a somewhat different methodology than our regular research process used to identify high-impact non-profit ideas. Rather, it is intended to be a summary to help prospective founders and employees of EGIs understand why we think this is an impactful opportunity. It also serves the purpose of public accountability, by explicitly stating the theory of change we envision for this program.&nbsp;</p><h2>Acknowledgments</h2><p>We are grateful to all the experts who so kindly gave their time and thoughts in interviews and surveys.</p><h1>1. What is an Effective Giving Initiative (EGI)?</h1><p>Effective Giving Initiatives are entities that focus on raising money for effective nonprofits and other high-impact funding opportunities. Often, they narrow their outreach focus to a particular geographic area or interest group in order to tailor their messaging to their specific audience. EGIs can be fully independent organizations, but can also collaborate in a variety of forms with existing giving organizations.</p><p>Many successful giving organizations operate on a national level. These national organizations seek to enable local donors \u2013 who otherwise would not have been exposed to these ideas \u2013 to learn about the principles of evidence-based and high-impact giving. They tend to accept donations on behalf of their recommended charities and regrant the money to these charities. Additionally, as a donation platform, these organizations facilitate the donation experience and provide tax deductibility (where possible) to their donors, even if the recipient charity is based outside of the donor\u2019s country. By directing the gifts from these donors to the most effective charities and projects, EGIs can amplify the impact of individual donors, contributing significantly to solving the world's most pressing problems.</p><p>Through local language websites, EGIs are able to:</p><ul><li>Inform potential donors, particularly those who do not speak English as their main language, about effective giving in general.</li><li>Present an up-to-date selection of high-impact giving opportunities.</li><li>Provide practical ways to make (tax-deductible) donations to effective charities.</li><li>Offer personalized donation advice.</li></ul><h2>Narrative examples</h2><p>In early 2019 a new EGI called Effektiv Spenden was founded in Germany. Over the following 3 years, this small team was able to establish itself as an authoritative voice on evidence-based giving and high-impact philanthropy. They set up a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://effektiv-spenden.org/?gclid=CjwKCAiAx_GqBhBQEiwAlDNAZpiZJWu8LaZRPM6Szy5LZRhLmqc9bOpvqH74ftdKps4-bPmmHV6joxoC3KEQAvD_BwE\"><u>website</u></a> and started fundraising through their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://effektiv-spenden.org/spenden/\"><u>donation platform</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://effektiv-spenden.org/spendenberatung/\"><u>philanthropic advisory services</u></a>. According to Effektiv Spenden, they&nbsp;<a href=\"https://effektiv-spenden.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Effektiv-Spenden-Jahresbericht-2022.pdf\"><u>grew</u></a> from \u20ac330.000 in donations in their first year in 2019 to having raised \u20ac 15.3 million from more than 9,000 donors in 2022 for some of the most effective charities in the world. As a result of this success, the team grew from &lt;2 FTE in 2021 to approx. 7 FTE in 2023 to invest in further growth.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><p>Following in the footsteps of Effektiv Spenden, a new EGI called Doneer Effectief was founded in the Netherlands in 2022.&nbsp; They started an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doneereffectief.nl/en\"><u>online donor platform</u></a> on October 1st, 2022. In their first operating year, they\u2019ve already raised \u20ac1.4 million. In addition to more established fundraising techniques, Doneer Effectief has pioneered using local ambassadors to promote effective giving (for example working with bestselling author&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rutger_Bregman\"><u>Rutger Bregman</u></a>) and appearing in many&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doneereffectief.nl/en/discover/\"><u>newspapers, magazines, public radio, podcasts and television</u></a> shows.</p><h1>2. Why is this promising?</h1><h2>a) There is still a lack of funding for effective charities</h2><p>Over the last couple of years, many new highly impactful charities have gotten started to solve the world's most pressing problems. However, as we have previously&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/GFkzLx7uKSK8zaBE3/we-need-more-nuance-regarding-funding-gaps\"><u>written</u></a> about, there are still&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cjH2puDzAFrtrrThQ/despite-billions-of-extra-funding-small-donors-can-still\"><u>significant gaps in funding</u></a> for these charities, which pose a significant risk to their survival and impact over the long term. Even many established highly impactful charities (in particular global health charities) have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2022/07/05/update-on-givewells-funding-projections/\"><u>significant room to absorb more funding effectively</u></a> (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/amf\"><u>AMF room for more funding</u></a> as an example).&nbsp;</p><h2>b) EGIs are a proven effective way to raise these funds</h2><p>Our review of existing EGIs\u2019 impact reporting shows that these kinds of giving organizations can raise substantial funds and direct them to highly impactful causes. Further, we find good evidence that the percentage of money raised that is counterfactual (i.e. would not have otherwise been donated) is about 50% of the total raised. For example:</p><ul><li>Effektiv Spenden (Germany) has raised \u20ac37 million between 2019-2022. They&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/117fsXWAX6Z4ntZLr0cHFleGAU89HtdPwtcZT_j5REFo/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>estimate</u></a> that for the amount of money spent on their operations, they were able to direct 13 times as much to high-impact nonprofits that would not have otherwise been donated in the last three years (2020-2022).</li><li>Giving What We Can (Global, registered in the UK and USA)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/impact\"><u>estimates</u></a> that for the amount of money spent on their operations between 2020-2022, they were able to direct&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l0RjbMLXjwjy5Pqg4aLe-_YDLXw8T3DT5QP0AQGYHTo/edit\">30 times as much to high-impact nonprofits that would not have otherwise been donated</a>. Extremely conservatively, this&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MF9bAdISMOMV_aOok9LMyKbxDEpOsvZ9VO8AfwsS6_o/edit#gid=91340629\">could be as low as 9 times as much</a>, which would still be impressive.</li><li>RC Forward (Canada) raised $2.14M CAD (~$1.58M USD) in 2019 and has moved $6.7M CAD (~ $4.93M USD) in total since 2017. They&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rcforward.org/rc-forward-2019-cost-effectiveness-and-project-review/\">estimate</a> that for the amount of money spent on their operations, they are able to direct 4-10 times as much to high-impact nonprofits that would not have otherwise been donated.</li><li>Doneer Effectief (Netherlands) raised \u20ac1.4 million in its 1st year of operating. It is still too early to assess the proportion of this fundraising that is truly counterfactual, but we have no reason to believe that it would differ significantly from the estimates of similar EGIs.</li></ul><h2>c) EGIs can improve funding diversity for effective charities</h2><p>Extra funding from EGIs can help diversify the funding sources for highly effective charities, which is a benefit over and above increasing the amount of money available. At the moment, funding for effectiveness-minded charities is concentrated in the hands of a few large donors. However, diversified donor bases are good for the health of individual organizations, to avoid being overly dependent on any one donor. Furthermore, large funders often have a cap on how much of an organization\u2019s funding gap they will fill. This leaves room for other donors to fill in the funding gap.</p><h2>d) New EGIs can leverage the work of others</h2><p>Established EGIs have developed a deep repository of knowledge, resources, systems, and processes that new actors can build off of as a foundation. This has two large benefits: New EGIs will (a) have a significantly higher chance of successfully launching and (b) be able to move faster and have impact sooner than they would if they were starting from scratch. GWWC and ES are open to various forms of collaboration with new EGIs that have similar target audiences.&nbsp;</p><h2>e) CE could help create successful EGIs</h2><p>CE has an excellent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/our-charities\"><u>track record</u></a> of launching highly impactful organizations and has industry-leading expertise in incubating and training charity founders. CE also has a solid network and pipeline of excellent applicants which will ensure good candidate selection.</p><p>Expert interviews on the main contributors to success revealed a number of factors that could plausibly be provided by a CE Incubation Program:</p><ul><li>Interviewees most strongly emphasized the importance of having excellent potential founders, who receive seed funding allowing them to focus on building and growing their organization full-time.</li><li>Interviewees suggested success might have been accelerated by things such as practical help on legal structures, support on back-end software to manage donations, advice on how to manage High Net Worth donors, and more knowledge on marketing.</li><li>Overall, the experts interviewed were largely enthusiastic about an incubation program for more EGIs.</li></ul><h2>f) Relevant external stakeholders are invested in ensuring the success of the program</h2><p>GWWC and other relevant effective giving organizations have expressed their excitement for this new initiative and have offered to support its development and implementation, as well as to keep coordinating and collaborating closely with the new EGIs after the program. This includes facilitating a mentorship program to help these new organizations learn from&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.notion.so/fb3752a779ac4e779015db6a8a2e0cc4?v=d93c0365c3e14753877ff0da08a11a69\"><u>more established effective giving&nbsp;</u></a>organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>g) EGIs can monitor impact by measuring funds moved</h2><p>Effective giving organizations have a strong track record of encouraging donors to give more, and more effectively, and of measuring the impact of this (see for example the work of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1l0RjbMLXjwjy5Pqg4aLe-_YDLXw8T3DT5QP0AQGYHTo/edit?pli=1\"><u>GWWC</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/117fsXWAX6Z4ntZLr0cHFleGAU89HtdPwtcZT_j5REFo/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>Effektiv Spenden</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.founderspledge.com/research/giving-multipliers\"><u>Founders Pledge</u></a>). This means that new EGIs will benefit from shorter feedback loops enabling them to measure which strategies work and which don\u2019t and to more quickly pivot and adapt.</p><h2>h) EGIs may have other positive indirect effects</h2><p>Apart from the direct effects of encouraging donations to cost-effective causes, promoting effective giving can also have indirect effects&nbsp;- such as promoting more evidence-based, impact-driven, and transparent thinking in the philanthropic sector. Research also suggests that donating to effective charities is a significant entry point into more effective actions. For example, in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/tzFcqGmCA6ePeD5wm/ea-survey-2020-how-people-get-involved-in-ea#What_factors_are_important_for_getting_involved_\"><u>2020 Survey</u></a> run by the Centre for Effective Altruism, 21% of respondents reported that Giving What We Can was important for them getting involved in Effective Altruism, with ~14% of respondents reporting that GWWC was one of their three largest influencers for their ability to have a positive impact.</p><h1>3. Top recommended target countries</h1><p>Although we think there is a case for a lot of different approaches within effective giving (e.g. career-based groups, pledges, geographically focused groups) we think one of the most promising avenues is regionally focused effective giving projects. In terms of target countries, a few stand out as uniquely promising, based both on the&nbsp;<i>donation potential</i> and&nbsp;<i>tractability</i>. To estimate the donation potential, we modeled funds raised from existing EGIs and extrapolated to new countries based on a number of metrics that appear to be relatively predictive of potential donations raised, such as population and GDP. A limitation of this approach is that the data we have on existing&nbsp; EGIs is in Western countries, with specific populations and wealth ranges. It is less clear that our model predicts donation potential as well for other regions in the world or other demographic settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>For the tractability assessment, we used several proxies such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cafonline.org/docs/default-source/about-us-research/caf_world_giving_index_2022_210922-final.pdf\"><u>World Giving Index</u></a> ranking, the size of the Effective Altruist community as a proxy for impact-mindedness, as well as expert interviews with people from these countries. We have excluded countries that from our analysis seem to be fully covered by existing EGIs, but included some where activities might be substantially expanded. The results of this can be found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SDNoOW52ZKnbXUjFomcZZHiQN1GGRgrFQEVqO8qGP4w/edit#heading=h.104vxrjx3jk2\"><u>Appendix A: Country Analysis</u></a>.</p><p>Based on this analysis, we are particularly excited about new EGIs in the following countries. However, we are also open to people presenting a strong case for countries that are not on the list.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#e86f2b;border:1pt solid #e86f2b;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>Category A</strong></p></td><td style=\"background-color:#e86f2b;border:1pt solid #e86f2b;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>Category B</strong></p></td><td style=\"background-color:#e86f2b;border:1pt solid #e86f2b;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>Category C</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #e86f2b;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Ireland</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #e86f2b;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Singapore</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #e86f2b;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>United States</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #e86f2b;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Belgium</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #e86f2b;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>South Korea</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #e86f2b;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>France</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #e86f2b;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Italy</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #e86f2b;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Japan</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #e86f2b;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #e86f2b;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>India</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #e86f2b;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>United Arab Emirates</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #e86f2b;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #e86f2b;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">&nbsp;</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #e86f2b;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Mexico</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #e86f2b;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h1>4.

Founder personal fit</h1><p>From our experience of launching somewhat similar organizations and meta charities, we believe that generalist skills, rather than any specific experience or formal credentials are especially important to be a good fit.&nbsp;</p><p>What all our founding teams do have in common is\u2026</p><ul><li>A deep dedication to doing as much good as possible</li><li>Ambition to make rapid progress and achieve results</li><li>Open-mindedness and the drive to always keep learning</li><li>The determination and creativity to keep going even in the face of difficulties</li><li>Diverse and complementary skill sets</li></ul><p>Specifically for this program, we think that ideal co-founders could additionally have strong skills in communication &amp; relationship building. They would combine this with a strong focus on impact and results. They may also have previous experience in fundraising or strategic marketing, though this is not a requirement.&nbsp;</p><p>Having a strong cultural connection to the identified top countries (for instance from currently living in this country or having lived there for several years previously, or for other reasons), as well as speaking the language, is preferable for at least one of the co-founders. However, we encourage applicants of all nationalities to apply.</p><p>At least one co-founder would be conscientious and detail-oriented, and be quick to learn how to ensure that the organization remains compliant with local charity law. At least one co-founder would be willing to learn more about doing public outreach, such as speaking to the media, speaking at events, or similar.</p><p>An ideal founding team would feel positive about the impact that can be achieved through donations, which is high leverage, but also one step removed from direct interventions. Research skills seem to be less necessary for this kind of charity, though the founding team would need to be good at and/or interested in learning more about how the impact of charities is evaluated.</p><h1>7. Program design</h1><p>Our research to date suggests that founding an EGI requires many of the same skills that we look for in all our charity entrepreneurs. We, therefore, believe that a program could build on Charity Entrepreneurship\u2019s existing Incubation Program complemented with additional training and support specific to launching EGIs. This might include, but is not limited to:&nbsp;</p><p>Co-founder Pairing</p><ul><li>The core of CE\u2019s Incubation Program is to match each participant to an idea (in this case to start an EGI) and to a talented and complementary co-founder. Our experience is that this co-founder pairing process is crucial to the organization's launch and growth. Better people, better matched tend to lead to better outcomes.&nbsp;</li><li>Throughout the program participants will co-work in various pairings on trial tasks, testing their fit with various partners. As the program progresses they will narrow in on their best pairing and present a proposal for funding as a duo.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Nationally relevant strategy: Research and Planning&nbsp;</p><ul><li>The different recommended locations for EGIs have very different strategic opportunities. In some regions primarily targeting \u201cretail\u201d donors may be most applicable, while in others, high fidelity partnering and advising of high net worth individuals may yield better results. In others, becoming a spokesperson for the idea of effective giving may take priority. Exploring these different strategic options per the different locations and the skills of the potential founders will be a key element of the program.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Training on Outreach &amp; Marketing Strategies&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Learning what works in terms of outreach, PR, media, social media and relationship building from existing EGIs will be practical and valuable aspects of this program. Existing organizations will share what\u2019s worked in the past, what hasn\u2019t and what lessons can be learned.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Evaluating potential donation opportunities</p><ul><li>The endline effectiveness of an EGI is largely dependent on the extent to which they direct the received donations to the most counterfactually high-impact opportunities worldwide.&nbsp;</li><li>EGIs tend to defer to professional and reputable charity evaluators to assess which donation opportunities are most impactful. In this program, we\u2019ll learn how to assess their work, which evaluators work in which topic areas (for example, some evaluators are experts in Global Health and Development while others have expertise in Climate Action). A key aspect of this program will be to understand whose research to put credence in and how much to defer to their work and why.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Practical, legal, administrative and technical support</p><ul><li>EGIs will likely confront similar operational challenges, such as setting up a legally compliant structure for receiving and sending donations; building a public-facing website that has a functional software back-end; and making sure the administrative processes are in place. We believe an incubation program could provide a platform for organizations to learn from each other and make use of common resources.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><h1>Appendix A: Country Analysis</h1><h2>Category A: Top recommended countries</h2><p>We believe that the following countries are both promising and tractable:</p><h3>Ireland</h3><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:#e86f2b;border-style:solid;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Pros</strong></td><td style=\"background-color:#e86f2b;border-style:solid;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Cons</strong></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #e86f2b;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>Donation Potential</strong> - Donation potential of about 2.2m USD / year&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Wealth</strong> - Very high GDP per Capita (PPP)</p><p><strong>EA Community</strong> - The EA community seems quite widespread with 3.7 EAs / 100,000 people</p><p><strong>Language</strong> - A lot of English messaging and content can be reused</p><p><strong>Culture of Donating</strong> - Ranks relatively high on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cafonline.org/docs/default-source/about-us-research/caf_world_giving_index_2022_210922-final.pdf\"><u>World Giving Index</u></a> at #14</p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid #e86f2b;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>Size</strong> - With 5 million inhabitants, Ireland is quite small.

Optional additional support from GWWC</h1><p>GWWC will provide ongoing support to these new EGIs so they don\u2019t need to build infrastructure from scratch and can learn from best practices in the effective giving space. In addition to offering general advice, support, and mentorship, GWWC can also provide its brand and product (<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/\"><u>website</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/donate/organizations\"><u>donation platform</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/pledge/flow\"><u>pledge infrastructure</u></a>) in some cases. If new EGIs wish to take advantage of these optional offers of additional support, there are currently 2 clear ways to further collaborate with GWWC, although other options can be discussed:</p><h2>Option 1: Brand Partnership</h2><p>Under this arrangement, organizations would have the ability to use GWWC's brand with slight modifications if desired. However, there would be a condition that organizations using GWWC's brand would likely be limited to raising funds for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/why-and-how-gwwc-evaluates-the-evaluators\"><u>charities endorsed by the GWWC research team in consultation with expert evaluators</u></a>. While there may be some possibility to raise funds for other charities, it should be made clear that the level of research conducted on them is not as extensive as the core recommendations. Even in this case, the ability to do so would be at the discretion of GWWC.</p><p>E.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ayudaefectiva.org/?gclid=CjwKCAjwzo2mBhAUEiwAf7wjknWR1xpU30f6XjRwpUJ0JQyNmaqe4bjNjAJTe2tLB7AEO5FCYSjKFBoCNnYQAvD_BwE\"><u>Ayuda Efectiva</u></a> \u2013 GWWC provided a brand partnership and Ayuda Efectiva acts as the community for their members in Spain with their Executive Director being an Ambassador for Giving What We Can.</p><h2>Option 2: Brand partnership and product license</h2><p>In addition to using the GWWC brand, organizations may also be able to use the GWWC product. This includes the technical infrastructure of GWWC, such as the admin interface, business intelligence tool, website and content management system, donation platform, pledge platform, and end-of-tax-year tax receipts. Currently, GWWC does not have plans to develop a white-labeled&nbsp;product.

The aim is to extend the concept of carbon credits to poverty reduction and create new financing that ties funding directly to the impact created by poverty-reduction projects. It is also hoped that this program would improve access to funding for smaller organizations that may not be able to finance randomized control trial studies (RCTs) to validate their impacts to high degrees of confidence from an academic perspective.</p><p>Many global health and welfare (GHW) interventions give socially useful products to people for free (such as medicines or bednets). Poverty-reduction or impact credit financing may be useful for administering a partial subsidy for items that are not distributed for free, but which are distributed at a discount price. The poverty-reduction credit can quantify the amount of subsidy that a product might deserve based on its social or health benefits.&nbsp;</p><p>Key Requirements for this program:</p><ol><li>\u201cPoverty credit\u201d financing must be contractually committed before the associated impact is created.</li><li>Project impact is measured in standardized units for donor\u2019s easy comparison between projects. (e.g. People-Percent-Years of impact)</li><li>Verification procedures are defined to ensure evidence of impact is properly defined and created, ideally without the use of expensive RCTs. Procedures are agreed to by the project implementer and project financier.&nbsp;</li></ol><h1>Poverty Reduction Credits:</h1><p>The main idea behind a poverty-reduction credit is to create a market for impact that can more dynamically set a price that is transparent and open to a larger number of implementers and donors. Right now, a few organizations set an effective price for impact, but if donors and project implementers are not directly involved with those organizations, any transactions outside of those organizations are not being done based on a clear and transparent \u201cimpact price.\u201d</p><p>While voluntary carbon credit markets have their imperfections and inefficiencies, one thing the market has been very successful with is getting a large diversity of impact buyers and project implementers involved in climate mitigation projects.&nbsp;</p><p>Another benefit of carbon credit markets is that it incentivized many actors to quantify their impact in terms of a clearly measurable unit, i.e. tons of CO2-equivalent impact. Similarly, a poverty reduction credit market may incentivize much more attention and effort at quantifying progress with respect to poverty reduction in similarly clear, quantifiable units: people-percent-years of standard of living/utility increase.&nbsp;</p><h1>Quantifying poverty reduction</h1><p>The quantity that we use for measuring poverty reduction is the \u201cpeople-percent-year\u201d which is defined as increasing the income of 1 person by 1% for 1 year.&nbsp;</p><p>According to Open Philanthropy, \u201cwe need to be \u2026 increasing income for 4 people by ~1% for a year for $1\u201d<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-planned-allocation-to-givewells-recommendations-for-the-next-few-years/\"><sup><u>1</u></sup></a><sup>&nbsp;</sup>.Open Philanthropy derives this value because they expect to have an impact per $1 that is \u201cslightly over 2000x.\u201d And they \u201cuse a logarithmic utility function anchored at $50K.\u201d Essentially, they are assuming that an X-percent change in income has the same utility (or humanitarian value) no matter what the base income might be.&nbsp;</p><p>The \u201c2000x\u201d threshold used by Open Philanthropy means that they want a poverty-reducing dollar provided in a development project to have the same impact as $2000 donated to someone who has a per-capita income of $50K. Their effective impact of $2000 benefit for someone who might earn $50K/year is equivalent to a 4% income increase for one person for one year(i.e. four people-percent-years(PPY)).&nbsp;</p><p>Thus Open Philanthropy has a threshold of $0.25 per person-percent-year of poverty reduction.&nbsp;</p><h2>Example application of PPY credits</h2><p>Solar4africa distributes subsidized pumps which can generate more than $500/year of new income for families that are earning as little as $200 per person per year. The $500 per year increase in income is $100 per person per year, which is a 50% increase of income for five people. If these pumps last for 10 years and increase the income of 5 people by 50%, then this represents poverty reduction of 5 people x 50 percent x 10 years = 2500 PPY.&nbsp; And if 1 PPY is worth up to $0.25, then the maximum justifiable subsidy for the pump is 2500 x $0.25 = $625. Note that the PPY credits would be received in the years that the PPY impact is verified. So the pump in this case might earn $62.50/year worth of PPY credits for the project implementer over 10 years if the impact can be verified.&nbsp;</p><p>The cost of a portable solar pump system is between $200-300. So if a poverty reduction credit can be financed at Open Philanthropy\u2019s \u201cprice\u201d for funding poverty reduction, then projects like this could be efficiently financed for any implementer and the \u201cearning\u201d of PPY credits could be potentially profitable for any implementing business, charity or institution.&nbsp;</p><p>Note that the key to a solar pump earning a large number of PPY credits is to have the solar pumping system last a long time and be used well. This is exactly the type of incentive that a poverty-reducing development program might want to create, because long-lasting, well-utilized pumps will produce maximum economic benefits.&nbsp;</p><h1>Next steps</h1><p>The next steps in this project are to define in detail the use of PPY credits for a particular \u201cuse case\u201d in a demonstration project where an initial \u201cstart-up\u201d philanthropic donation helps finance income-generating investments by very-low-income households. Then additional philanthropic donations that are tied to measurement of impacts that generate \u201cPPY credits\u201d that are used for financing the expansion of the project over time through the purchase of additional income generation equipment in subsequent years. If the poverty-reduction that is created by the initial start-up philanthropic investment is large, then the PPY credits will generate enough surplus revenue for the project to expand rapidly over time. If the impact that can be verified and measured is not enough to pay off the initial investment, then the project will have to decrease the use of PPY credit revenues to sustain itself over time.&nbsp;</p><p>By tying the PPY credit revenues to a measured impact at an \u201cefficient price\u201d this creates a natural selection for high-performing projects which will grow rapidly because they generate enough poverty reduction to rapidly pay off the initial costs of the project and subsequently grow..&nbsp;</p><h1>Other considerations and issues</h1><p>Even after a demonstration project is defined and implemented, larger scale implementation of a PPY credit scheme would require addressing system issues that may arise such as:</p><ol><li>\u2018Bad\u2019 credits, cheating, and credit for actions that would have happened without the market</li><li>Tradability (e.g. Are they something that a corporate CSR program might buy into?)</li><li>How prices for credits may change over time</li><li>Balancing verification procedure cost versus accuracy</li><li>Assuring that income and impacts are measured accurately</li></ol><p>As I work on this project I plan to post updates on progress.

General overview of wild-caught shrimp fisheries</strong></h1><p>There are many, many,&nbsp;<i>many</i> shrimp caught in wild-catch fisheries each year. Specifically, it is estimated that around 37.4 trillion shrimp are caught in wild-catch fisheries each year, and that is probably an underestimate.</p><p>Broadly speaking, there are three types of shrimp:</p><ul><li>Caridean shrimp (781 billion caught each year). These shrimp are actually more closely related to crabs and lobsters than to the other two types of shrimp, which is why the evidence for shrimp sentience tends to be focused on this group. They are relatively small (e.g. a few centimetres). Caridean shrimp are mostly caught in cold-water (temperate) fisheries. Important caridean shrimp fisheries include the North Sea shrimp trawl fishery (the Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, and the UK) and the North Atlantic and Pacific shrimp trawl fisheries (USA, Canada, Russia, Greenland).</li><li>Penaeid shrimp (287 billion caught each year). These shrimp are mostly in warm-water (tropical) fisheries, and they physically tend to be a bit larger in body size. Important penaeid shrimp fisheries include the trawl fishery in the USA, trawl and small-scale fisheries in Latin America, and trawl and small-scale fisheries in East and South-East Asia.</li><li>Sergestid shrimp (36.3 trillion caught each year). This group includes the \"paste shrimp\",&nbsp;<i>Acetes japonicus</i>. Sergestid shrimp are tiny, sometimes even microscopic. These are very common in small-scale fisheries in East and South-East Asia, as well as East Africa.</li></ul><p>It's important to understand that these three types of shrimp are distinct. Caridean shrimp are actually more closely related to lobsters, crabs, and crayfish than they are to penaeid and sergestid shrimp.&nbsp; There are important differences in their biology, their evolutionary histories, the corresponding fishing industries, the amount of research that has been conducted on sentience, and - most importantly - the tractability of welfare improvements in fisheries. Those differences are explained in more detail in the full report.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/9KP2qLnfutRmj6Jm9/c580zirvm6ocjjxlhwxq\"></p><p><i>(Credit: Shrimp silhouettes in the evolutionary tree are from phylopic.org.

Lobster: Guillaume Dera.)</i></p><p><br><br>We can also distinguish between two major types of shrimp fisheries:</p><ul><li>Industrial trawl fisheries. These may be large, high-power trawler vessels that can conduct journeys for weeks or months at a time. These vessels may be technologically sophisticated, with many processing, packaging, and storing shrimp on-board. Industrial trawl fisheries are common in both developed (e.g. North America, Europe) and developing (e.g. Latin America, China, South Korea, and many South-East Asian) countries.</li><li>Small-scale fisheries. These may involve small boats or by wading into the water from the shore. There are small-scale trawls, and there are also many other gear types. Small-scale fisheries are more common in developing countries (especially South-East Asia), though with some exceptions (e.g. Ireland).</li></ul><p>Some countries combine both types of fisheries (especially in Latin America, China, South Korea, and India).</p><p>Beyond the impacts on shrimp themselves, there are some other challenges associated with shrimp fisheries around the world:</p><ul><li>Bycatch. The weight of catch from shrimp trawlers sometimes reaches even 80-90% non-target animals. This includes other shrimp and invertebrates, finfish, turtles, marine mammals, and seabirds.</li><li>Enforcement. There are many countries, particularly developing countries, that struggle with enforcing fisheries regulations.</li><li>Environmental degradation. Many trawl fisheries have caused overfishing. Beyond the environmental effects, this also means that it has become harder in many countries for fishers to catch enough shrimp to earn a living.</li><li>Poverty. A good example of this is the small-scale fisheries in Vietnam, where coastal communities are disproportionately poor and have comparatively little political representation. Poverty interacts with environmental degradation and enforcement in complex ways - any policies or interventions around fisheries probably need to be incorporated into a more overarching poverty strategy.</li><li>Human rights violations. There is well-documented evidence of forced labour (modern slavery) aboard fishing vessels, most notably aboard trawlers in Thailand. In Thailand's fisheries, the prevalence of forced labour was estimated at 14% in 2019. This is often exacerbated by social crises and/or government policies in neighbouring countries - for example, people forced into labour aboard Thai vessels are often Rohingya men who are fleeing ethnic cleansing/genocide in Myanmar (often exacerbated by restrictive refugee policies in neighbouring countries)</li><li>It's difficult work. Even on trawlers in well-regulated countries, shrimp fishing is pretty intense and even dangerous work.</li></ul><h1><strong>2. Shrimp welfare interventions in wild-catch fisheries</strong></h1><p>In industrial trawl fisheries, some promising interventions are:</p><ul><li>Installing electrical stunners on trawl vessels</li><li>Reducing trawl durations</li><li>Reducing trawl weights (having less weight of prawns in the trawl net before it is hauled onto the vessel)</li><li>Optimising on-board logistics to reduce the shrimp processing time, thereby preventing asphyxiation and reducing temperature stress</li><li>Continuing existing work on reducing bycatch</li></ul><p>In small-scale fisheries, particularly in developing countries, it may be more plausible to instead focus on:</p><ul><li>Finding ways to help governments enforce existing fisheries regulations</li><li>Optimising shrimp storage and hygiene processes on-board and on land to reduce spoilage, thereby reducing the wastage of shrimp due to hygiene or contamination issues</li><li>Encouraging people to modify the way shrimp paste is made to contain a lower content of shrimp</li></ul><p>And crucially, it would be really useful to conduct extra research. This includes:</p><ul><li>Basic (experimental) research on shrimp sentience. There are a few important knowledge gaps in the evidence for shrimp sentience and whether sentience differs between shrimp groups.</li><li>Applied research on shrimp welfare, such as what capture methods and on-board conditions cause the most stress.</li><li>Improving the data on the number of shrimp killed by shrimp fisheries in each country. There are some well-known problems with fisheries data in general, and shrimp fisheries in particular have high levels of bycatch and unreported catch.</li></ul><h1><strong>3.

They contact \u00c9mile Torres, David Gerard, and Timnit Gebru, collect evidence about Sam Bankman-Fried, the OpenAI board blowup, and Pasek's Doom, start calling Astral Codex Ten (ACX) readers to ask them about rumors they'd heard about affinity between Effective Altruists, neoreactionaries, and something called TESCREAL. They spend hundreds of hours over six months on interviews and evidence collection, paying \u00c9mile and Timnit for their time and effort. The phrase \"HBD\" is muttered, but it's nobody's birthday.</p><p>A few days before publication, they present key claims to the Centre for Effective Altruism (CEA), who furiously tell them that many of the claims are provably false and ask for a brief delay to demonstrate the falsehood of those claims, though their principles compel them to avoid threatening any form of legal action. The Times unconditionally refuses, claiming it must meet a hard deadline. The day before publication, Scott Alexander gets his hands on a copy of the article and informs the Times that it's full of provable falsehoods. They correct one of his claims, but tell him it's too late to fix another.</p><p>The final article comes out. It states openly that it's not aiming to be a balanced view, but to provide a deep dive into the worst of EA so people can judge for themselves. It contains lurid and alarming claims about Effective Altruists, paired with a section of responses based on its conversation with EA that it says provides a view of the EA perspective that CEA agreed was a good summary. In the end, it warns people that EA is a destructive movement likely to chew up and spit out young people hoping to do good.</p><p>In the comments, the overwhelming majority of readers thank it for providing such thorough journalism. Readers broadly agree that waiting to review CEA's further claims was clearly unnecessary. David Gerard pops in to provide more harrowing stories. Scott gets a polite but skeptical hearing out as he shares his story of what happened, and one enterprising EA shares hard evidence of one error in the article to a mixed and mostly hostile audience. A few weeks later, the article writer pens a triumphant follow-up about how well the whole process went and offers to do similar work for a high price in the future.</p><p>This is not an essay about the New York Times.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bwtpBFQXKaGxuic6Q/pvaegdbhqbusti2rf9xy\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bwtpBFQXKaGxuic6Q/lnj5f6fekfasqyp7sswz 119w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bwtpBFQXKaGxuic6Q/iamijtvb6g7fsug5amjq 199w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bwtpBFQXKaGxuic6Q/ra2uekqlwhr9dnjabxyc 279w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bwtpBFQXKaGxuic6Q/ca20p1wytpuy7av82icc 359w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bwtpBFQXKaGxuic6Q/fnnreyr2trrwfiiyyxxa 439w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bwtpBFQXKaGxuic6Q/okwzoj1acgfca0izkaiu 519w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bwtpBFQXKaGxuic6Q/ifx2348425p3fovtxpwz 599w\"></figure><p>The rationalist and EA communities tend to feel <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ESYudkowsky/status/1361091726069260289\">a certain way</a> about the New York Times. <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2020/06/22/nyt-is-threatening-my-safety-by-revealing-my-real-name-so-i-am-deleting-the-blog/\">Adamantly</a> a certain way. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KelseyTuoc/status/1588235355001540609\">Emphatically</a> a certain way, even.

Some of you know me from my <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/09/04/acc-entry-does-the-education-system-adequately-serve-advanced-students/\">adversarial collaboration in Scott's contest</a> some years ago, others from my <a href=\"https://tracingwoodgrains.substack.com/p/speedrunning-college-four-years-later\">misadventures in \"speedrunning\" college</a>, still others from <a href=\"https://tracingwoodgrains.substack.com/p/rantiwork-a-tragedy-of-sanewashing\">my exhaustively detailed deep dives into obscure subculture drama</a> (sometimes in connection with <a href=\"https://www.blockedandreported.org/p/when-punch-a-nazi-goes-wrong\">my job</a>).</p><p>The last, I'm afraid, is why I'm here this time around\u2014I wish we were meeting on better terms. I saw a certain malcontent<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftw8u4ay942\"><sup><a href=\"#fntw8u4ay942\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;complaining that his abrasiveness was poorly received, stopped by to see what he was on about, and got sucked in\u2014as one is\u2014by every word of the blow-by-blow fighting between two companies I knew nothing about in an ecosystem where I am a neighbor but certainly not a member. I came to this fresh: never having heard of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/ben-pace?mention=user\">@Ben Pace</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/habryka?mention=user\">@Habryka</a>, or Nonlinear, having about as much knowledge of EA as any outsider can have while having no ties to its in-person community, and with the massive benefit of hindsight in being able to read side-by-side what active EA forum users read three months apart. I pursued it out of sheer fascination when I should have been studying for my Civil Procedure final, entranced by a saga that would not leave my mind.</p><p>What precisely do I think of Nonlinear, a group I had never heard of prior to a few days ago? More-or-less <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/theschism/comments/189jcuq/discussion_thread_63_december_2023/kdl9rj4/\">what my friends think</a>, really\u2014credit them for the bulk of the following description. It sounds like a minor celebrity got comfortably rich young, dove into the same fascinating online ecosystem we all did, and decided to spend his retirement with his partner (who has an impressive history of dedication to charity) and brother scratching his itch to be productive by traveling the world and doing charity via talking with cool, smart people about meaningful ideas. It sounds like they hired someone who imagined doing charity work but instead lived a life more akin to that of a live-in assistant to a celebrity, picked up another traveling-partner-turned-employee with a long history of tumultuous encounters, and had a lot of very predictable drama of the sort that happens when young people live as roommates and traveling partners with their bosses.</p><p>From there, the ex-employees, disillusioned and burnt out, began spreading allegations that toed and sometimes crossed the line between \"exaggerated\" and \"fabricated\", and the founders learned an important lesson about mixing work and pleasure, one that soon turned into the much crueller lesson of what it feels like to be sewn inside a punching bag and dangled in front of your tight-knit community. They made a major unforced tactical error in taking so long to respond and another in not writing in the right sort of measured, precise tone that would have allowed them to defuse many criticisms. They were also unambiguously, inarguably, and severely wronged by the EA/LessWrong (LW) community as a whole.</p><p>What about Lightcone, a group I quickly realized maintains LessWrong, the ancestral home of my people? I'm grateful they've maintained a community that has inspired me and so many people like me. I get the sense that they're earnest, principled, precise thinkers who care deeply about ethical behavior. I've learned they recently faced the severe blow of watching a trusted community member be revealed as the fraud to end all frauds while feeling like there was something they could have done. I think they met earnest people who talked about feeling hurt and genuinely wanted to help to the best of their ability. And I wish I'd built up sufficient social capital with them to allow it to feel like a relationship of trust rather than the intrusion of a hostile stranger when I say they wrote one of the most careless, irresponsible, destructive callout articles I have ever had the displeasure of reading\u2014one they seem to continue to be in denial about.</p><p>In a sense, though, I think they should be thanked for it, because the community reaction to their article indicates it was not just them. I follow drama and blow-ups in a lot of different subcultures. It's my job. The response I saw from the EA and LessWrong communities to their article was thoroughly ordinary as far as subculture pile-ons go, even commendable in ways. Here's the trouble: the ways it was ordinary are the ways it aspires to be <i>extraordinary</i>, and as the community walked headlong into every pitfall of rumormongering and dogpiles, it did so while explaining at every step how reasonable, charitable, and prudent it was in doing so.</p><h3>The Story So Far: A Recap</h3><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH/sharing-information-about-nonlinear?commentId=PyyPM7TxZ9hfEj36w\">Starting in mid-2022</a>, two disgruntled former Nonlinear employees, referred to by the pseudonyms Alice and Chloe, began to spread rumors about the misery of their time there. They told these rumors to many people within the EA community, including CEA, requesting that CEA not tell Nonlinear about any of their complaints and pushing for unspecified action against the organization. CEA discussed the possibility of the former employees writing a public post, but they were unwilling to do so. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/L4S2NCysoJxgCBuB6/announcing-nonlinear-emergency-funding?commentId=5P75dFuKLo894MQFf\">In November 2022</a>, someone made an anonymous post spreading vague rumors about the same. As more rumors spread, some organizations within EA began to restrict Nonlinear's opportunities in the EA space, such as <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH/sharing-information-about-nonlinear?commentId=o8ro4fdAikNmqHKvZ\">CEA not inviting them to present at conferences</a>.</p><p>Ben Pace, who managed a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/psYNRb3JCncQBjd4v/shutting-down-the-lightcone-offices\">community hub</a> called the Lightcone offices, heard these rumors when Kat Woods and Drew Spartz of Nonlinear applied to visit the offices in early 2023, and told them he was concerned about them but still allowed a visit. Dissatisfied with Kat's explanations when he chatted with her, he began to investigate further, spending several hundred hours over six months looking for all negative information he could find about Nonlinear (centering around the experiences of those two former employees) via interviews and investigative research. Others in the Lightcone office participated in this process, with Oliver Habryka reporting the office as a whole spent <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/q4MXBzzrE6bnDHJbM/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims?commentId=tTj6fd2kDgsHc3rPR\">close to a thousand hours</a> on it. In collaboration with their sources, they set a publication date for an expos\u00e9 about Nonlinear.</p><p>Less than a week before the publication date, Ben informed Nonlinear that he had been digging into them with intent to publish an expos\u00e9 and sent them a list of concerns. Around <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/q4MXBzzrE6bnDHJbM/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims?commentId=8qvrnk8X2pk9hefqB\">60 hours</a> before publication, Ben had a three-hour phone call with the Nonlinear cofounders about those concerns in which they told him his list contained a number of exaggerations and fabrications. Nonlinear requested a week to compile and present evidence against these claimed fabrications, which Ben and Oliver rejected. The day before publication, longtime community member <a href=\"https://www.spencergreenberg.com/\">Spencer Greenberg</a> obtained a draft copy of the post and warned Ben and Oliver that it contained a number of falsehoods. Ben edited some, but when Spencer sent him message records contesting one claim in the post two hours before publication, Lightcone concluded it was too late to change and that the post must release on schedule. During the few days before publication and in particular after seeing a draft copy of the post, the Nonlinear founders grew increasingly urgent and aggressive in their messages, eventually threatening to sue Lightcone for defamation if they released the post without taking another week to investigate Nonlinear's evidence. Lightcone refused.</p><p>Ben released <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH/sharing-information-about-nonlinear\">the post</a> on September 7th to the EA/LW communities, where it was widely circulated and supported, including by <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH/sharing-information-about-nonlinear?commentId=PyyPM7TxZ9hfEj36w\">CEA's Community Health team</a>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefkd7hbvdyl5\"><sup><a href=\"#fnkd7hbvdyl5\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;After publishing the post, he paid Alice and Chloe $5,000 each. Kat shared screenshots contesting one of the post's claims in the comments section and Nonlinear promised a comprehensive reply as soon as possible. On September 15th, Ben released a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/5dW9p5EahtfhdiSKF/closing-notes-on-nonlinear-investigation\">postmortem</a> sharing further thoughts on Nonlinear and concluding that the CEA Community Health team was not doing enough to police the EA ecosystem. Nonlinear stayed mostly quiet until December 12th, when they released <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC/\">an in-depth post</a> contesting the bulk of the claims in the expos\u00e9.</p><p>On December 13th, I heard about this sequence of events and the players involved for the first time.</p><h3>Avoidable, Unambiguous Falsehoods in \"Sharing Information About Nonlinear\"</h3><p>If you have a strong stake in Nonlinear's reputation, I encourage you to read <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/q4MXBzzrE6bnDHJbM/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims\">their full response</a>, including the appendix. Here, I will aim towards something simpler: documenting some of the standout times Ben made claims easily and unambiguously contested by primary sources from Nonlinear, mostly about situations that occurred when Alice and Chloe were traveling with them, claims that could and should have been fixed with a modicum of effort. Each subsection that follows will begin with a direct pull quote from Ben\u2019s article and follow with my summary of the evidence Nonlinear provides rebutting it, with sources and specific screenshots in footnotes.</p><blockquote><p><i>\"My current understanding is that they\u2019ve had around ~4 remote interns, 1 remote employee, and 2 in-person employees (Alice and Chloe). Alice was the only person to go through their incubator program.\"</i></p></blockquote><p>Nonlinear has had 21 employees, including five other incubatees. This is a low-importance claim, but it's illustrative. Clarifying with Nonlinear, who was not only willing to clarify points with them but begging to do so, would have taken no time at all. To avoid fact-checking this demonstrates a low priority for fact-checking in general.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefu4e6pj0dpa\"><sup><a href=\"#fnu4e6pj0dpa\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><blockquote><p><i>\"they were not able to live apart from the family unit while they worked with them\"&nbsp;</i></p></blockquote><p>Per Nonlinear, Alice lived apart from them for six weeks during her four months of employment. This is a slight exception to my \"primary source\" rule\u2014verifying whether Alice lived apart for six weeks would take a bit more work than just Nonlinear's word, but it directly contradicts Ben's claim such that publication of the original claim becomes irresponsible.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnmtcawyp2w\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnmtcawyp2w\">[4]</a></sup></span></p><blockquote><p><i>\"Chloe\u2019s salary was verbally agreed to come out to around $75k/year. However, she was only paid $1k/month, and otherwise had many basic things compensated i.e. rent, groceries, travel. This was supposed to make traveling together easier, and supposed to come out to the same salary level.\"&nbsp;</i></p></blockquote><p>Nonlinear clearly explained Chloe's compensation scheme from the beginning and presented it in a clear and unambiguous written contract, which they fulfilled.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefundv3b73wta\"><sup><a href=\"#fnundv3b73wta\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;It was always conceptualized and presented as $1000 a month plus living expenses. She accepted the position knowing its compensation. It's not a level of compensation I'd advise anyone in it for the money to take, but the experience is the sort that many young people, including me, have pursued knowing there's a monetary tradeoff.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't agree with Nonlinear's apparent conception of benefits as functionally equivalent to pay given my experience in comparable situations (the military and a Mormon mission)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefri52hz2mmgq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnri52hz2mmgq\">[6]</a></sup></span>, but Chloe had no serious grounds to complain about salary, and Ben's description of it ignores the actual employment agreement and misrepresents the situation.</p><blockquote><p><i>\"Over her time there she spent through all of her financial runway, and spent a significant portion of her last few months there financially in the red (having more bills and medical expenses than the money in her bank account) in part due to waiting on salary payments from Nonlinear. She eventually quit due to a combination of running exceedingly low on personal funds and wanting financial independence from Nonlinear, and as she quit she gave Nonlinear (on their request) full ownership of the organization that she had otherwise finished incubating.\" ... \"At the time of her quitting she had \u20ac700 in her account, which was not enough to cover her bills at the end of the month, and left her quite scared. Though to be clear she was paid back ~\u20ac2900 of her outstanding salary by Nonlinear within a week, in part due to her strongly requesting it.\"</i></p></blockquote><p>Timed transactions straightforwardly demonstrate that aspects of Alice's claims about waiting for salary payments were false. Kat also explains that the delay in expense reimbursement was because Alice switched from recording in their public reimbursement system to using a private spreadsheet without telling them, and that they reimbursed Alice as soon as she told them. While the document provides no primary source on this, as with the \"not allowed to live apart\" claim, the counterclaim provides ample reason to either verify more closely or avoid publishing the falsehood.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefz5nlmd6fxs\"><sup><a href=\"#fnz5nlmd6fxs\">[7]</a></sup></span></p><blockquote><p><i>\"One of the central reasons Alice says that she stayed on this long was because she was expecting financial independence with the launch of her incubated project that had $100k allocated to it (fundraised from FTX). In her final month there Kat informed her that while she would work quite independently, they would keep the money in the Nonlinear bank account and she would ask for it, meaning she wouldn\u2019t have the financial independence from them that she had been expecting, and learning this was what caused Alice to quit.\"</i></p></blockquote><p>Nonlinear provides two screenshots to support an in-depth narrative that Alice's role was always as a project manager within Nonlinear, that they clarified repeatedly that she was a project manager within Nonlinear, that all of the funding in her project came via Nonlinear, that they would never have simply handed a quarter-million dollars to an untested new organization, and that Alice repeatedly attempted to claim she had a separate organization despite that.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefxwee4zq0s6f\"><sup><a href=\"#fnxwee4zq0s6f\">[8]</a></sup></span></p><p>Ben's quoted claim is not <i>technically</i> false: Alice did indeed seem to believe, or claim to believe, that she would get financial independence. It provides a misleading impression, though, to present it without any of the context and primary sources available from Nonlinear.</p><blockquote><p><i>\"Alice quit being vegan while working there. She was sick with covid in a foreign country, with only the three Nonlinear cofounders around, but nobody in the house was willing to go out and get her vegan food, so she barely ate for 2 days. Alice eventually gave in and ate non-vegan food in the house. She also said that the Nonlinear cofounders marked her quitting veganism as a \u2018win\u2019, as they had been arguing that she should not be vegan.\"</i></p></blockquote><p>There was vegan food in the house and they picked food up for her while sick themselves, but on one of the days they wanted to go to a Mexican place with limited vegan options instead of getting a vegan burger from Burger King.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref16o8e75ryh2\"><sup><a href=\"#fn16o8e75ryh2\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;\"Nobody in the house was willing to go out and get her vegan food\" is unambiguously false. Crucially, Ben had sufficient information to know it was false before the time of publication.</p><blockquote><p><i>\"Alice was polyamorous, and she and Drew entered into a casual romantic relationship. Kat previously had a polyamorous marriage that ended in divorce, and is now monogamously partnered with Emerson. Kat reportedly told Alice that she didn't mind polyamory \"on the other side of the world\u201d, but couldn't stand it right next to her, and probably either Alice would need to become monogamous or Alice should leave the organization.\"&nbsp;</i></p></blockquote><p>Kat points out that she recommended poly people for Alice to date multiple times, but felt strongly that Alice dating Drew (her colleague, roommate, and the brother of her boss) would be a bad idea. I happen to agree with her reasoning on that front and think subsequent events vindicated her. I find this claim particularly noxious because advising someone in the strongest possible terms against dating their boss's brother, who lives with them, seems from my own angle like a thoroughly sane thing to do. Kat's advice on that front was wholly vindicated.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefezaoevz588w\"><sup><a href=\"#fnezaoevz588w\">[10]</a></sup></span></p><blockquote><p><i>\"Before she went on vacation, Kat requested that Alice bring a variety of illegal drugs across the border for her (some recreational, some for productivity). Alice argued that this would be dangerous for her personally, but Emerson and Kat reportedly argued that it is not dangerous at all and was \u201cabsolutely risk-free\u201d. Privately, Drew said that Kat would \u201clove her forever\u201d if she did this.\"</i></p></blockquote><p>When you read \"bring a variety of illegal drugs across the border [...] (some recreational, some for productivity),\" do you think \"stop by a pharmacy for ADHD meds\"? I do not. It conjures up images of cartels, of back-alley meth deals, of steep danger and serious wrongdoing. For many responding to the original post, this was one of the most severe indicators of wrongdoing. If it had been accurately reported, whatever people think about casual Adderall use, it simply would not have had the same impact.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefinnqabjks0n\"><sup><a href=\"#fninnqabjks0n\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Oliver <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/q4MXBzzrE6bnDHJbM/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims?commentId=6NJZv7nmEEk66sEMn\">asserts</a> his belief that more is being covered up here\u2014I have no basis on which to judge this, but if so, it would have been an excellent point for Ben to confirm and present in specific while writing an article on the matter.</p><p>Ben and Oliver focus a great deal on the amount of time and effort that went into the post: 100-200 hours per the original post, 320 hours per Ben's <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/5dW9p5EahtfhdiSKF/\">postmortem</a>, somewhat over 1000 hours spread over the Lightcone staff per <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims?commentId=jZhKWfnjXXvgu3QzF\">a comment from Oliver</a>. They and the community alike use this time and effort to justify the difficulty of an investigation like this, the impracticality of asking for more, the high standards that went into the investigation, and the lack of need to add any sort of delay.</p><p>I believe they spent that time in productive, reasonable ways, but I keep coming back to an inescapable conclusion about it all: You can do a lot of cross-checking of a lot of claims in a thousand hours, but without talking with the people involved, you can do very little to cross-check the core allegations. The bulk of the claims I list above, and the bulk of the claims the community seems to have found most alarming, occurred in times and places where there were precisely five people present. &nbsp;Ben and Oliver spent a thousand hours diligently avoiding three of those five people while hearing and collecting rumors that they were vile, spent three hours with a publication date already set dumping every allegation on them at once, then flat-out refused to wait so much as a week to allow those three people to compile concrete material evidence against their claims.</p><p>They were, in fact, in such a hurry to release that when Spencer Greenberg got a last-minute look at the draft and warned them of serious inconsistencies, they hurriedly adjusted some before pleading lack of time on another and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims?commentId=dWgC9zCDhfDzCDDD4\">treating an update in the comments section as sufficient</a>. Oliver claims, and I have little reason to contest, that <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/q4MXBzzrE6bnDHJbM/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims?commentId=tTj6fd2kDgsHc3rPR\">Ben published (almost) nothing he knew was wrong at the time</a>. But they both knew they were receiving information contradicting their claims up until the moment of publication and being promised more of that information shortly.</p><p>The errors in this section and in the process that led to it are inexcusable for any published work purporting to be the result of serious investigation. They cannot be said to be either trivial or tangential. These are not the results of a truth-seeking process.</p><h3>These Issues Were Known and Knowable By Lightcone and the Community. The EA/LW Community Dismissed Them</h3><p>The original post and the discussion around it contained three glaring red flags:</p><ul><li>At the top, Ben reminded the community that the bulk of the post came from a search for negative information, not for a complete picture.</li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH/sharing-information-about-nonlinear?commentId=75GmvRBw9sRufYzFk\">In the comments</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/spencerg?mention=user\">@spencerg</a>, someone with a long history of good faith and fair dealing in the rationalist community, warned that the post contained many false claims, some of which he had warned Ben of immediately before publishing and Ben took half-hearted measures to correct.</li><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH/sharing-information-about-nonlinear?commentId=BksBdndbjpaPTk6uN\">Also in the comments</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/geoffreymiller?mention=user\">@Geoffrey Miller</a>, with his own long history of serious, sincere engagement within the rationalist community, exhorted the community to adhere to the standards of professional investigative journalism\u2014learned from bitter experience\u2014and to be professionally accountable for truth and balance\u2014and warned that the post realistically failed that standard.</li></ul><p>The community treated Ben's admission that he had been on a six-month hunt for negative information not as a signal saying \"I am writing a slanted hit piece\" the way they would if it came from any news organization in the country, but as one of good epistemic hygiene and honesty that would allow them to rationally and accurately update.</p><p>Judging by votes, people were somewhat receptive to Spencer and politely heard him out, but they did little to update based on his claims. Oliver's <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Lc8r4tZ2L5txxokZ8/sharing-information-about-nonlinear-1?commentId=zyWH2wWZ9gFNAZ4CF\">response</a>, claiming that the lawsuit threat was an attempt at intimidation that justified immediate release of all information and that 40 more hours of lost productive time was unreasonable to ask, was overwhelmingly more popular\u2014indeed, about as popular as a response gets in this ecosystem.</p><p>Geoffrey's reception was decidedly more mixed. The bulk of the community emphatically rejected Geoffrey's push to heed professional standards, with people claiming that in many cases those standards simply existed to protect the professionals, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH/sharing-information-about-nonlinear?commentId=kfmznomo758chjuHx\">citing a general distrust for established codes of professions and for the standards of investigative journalism in specific</a>, and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH/sharing-information-about-nonlinear?commentId=GAewRftW5m3gTHrWb\">claiming those standards set the bar too high for an already thankless task</a>.</p><p>In addition, <a href=\"https://viewpoints.xyz/polls/nonlinear-and-community-norms/results\">a plurality of the community</a> who voted in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/nathan?mention=user\">@Nathan Young</a>'s poll agreed with the decision not to delay posting.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bwtpBFQXKaGxuic6Q/iugfvdqvsa6holnaipif\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bwtpBFQXKaGxuic6Q/ek2lijqgus4bsu4mhbnx 90w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bwtpBFQXKaGxuic6Q/d5dpedif7hgoib04m3mt 180w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bwtpBFQXKaGxuic6Q/jebvaoi83kzcfidwpqf4 270w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bwtpBFQXKaGxuic6Q/zqh96bzhz2flgefocmgi 360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bwtpBFQXKaGxuic6Q/lu8qpi4q8svwy5quwwhm 450w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bwtpBFQXKaGxuic6Q/dutrhcc84bytidxpooyd 540w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bwtpBFQXKaGxuic6Q/bkvahbr13qssqpjdlbdh 630w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bwtpBFQXKaGxuic6Q/d0w31lzia5vmz7xb0bxz 720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bwtpBFQXKaGxuic6Q/ludu0qugz0vpkfj2pdjb 810w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bwtpBFQXKaGxuic6Q/p1mxqw3kxcazugq4wmyd 814w\"></figure><p>It is well and good to distrust journalism.

That is hard to square with lines like \"I expect that if Nonlinear does more hiring in the EA ecosystem it is more-likely-than-not to chew up and spit out other bright-eyed young EAs who want to do good in the world,\" hard to square with Ben's repeated assertions that claims in his post were credible, and hard to square with the duty you take on by electing to publish an expos\u00e9 about someone and telling people they can trust it due to the time you put into it and your stature within the community. You <i>have </i>to play the role of judge in a scenario like that.</p><p>It's worth examining the <a href=\"https://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp\">code of ethics</a> for the Society of Professional Journalists. A respect for truth as their fundamental aim is written into their first, second, and third principles:</p><blockquote><p>Ethical journalism should be accurate and fair. Journalists should be honest and courageous in gathering, reporting and interpreting information.</p><p>Journalists should:</p><ul><li>Take responsibility for the accuracy of their work. Verify information before releasing it. Use original sources whenever possible.</li><li>Remember that neither speed nor format excuses inaccuracy.</li><li>Provide context. Take special care not to misrepresent or oversimplify in promoting, previewing or summarizing a story.</li></ul></blockquote><p>I believe this is a fair, reasonable, and minimal standard for anyone aiming to do investigative work. It is not sufficient to claim epistemic uncertainty when promoting falsehoods, nor is it sufficient to say you are simply amplifying the falsehoods of your sources.</p><p>When you amplify someone's claims, you take responsibility for those claims. When you amplify false claims where contradictory evidence is available to you and you decline to investigate that contradictory evidence, you take responsibility for that. People live and die on their reputations, and spreading falsehoods that damage someone's reputation is and should be seen as more than just a minor faux pas.</p><p>Ben, so far as I can tell, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Lc8r4tZ2L5txxokZ8/sharing-information-about-nonlinear-1?commentId=MvwiubRBGLHvXBZ2h\">disputes this standard</a>, holding instead that past a relatively low threshold, unverified allegations should be spread: \"I think I'm more likely to say \"Hey, I currently assign 25% to &lt;very terrible accusation&gt;\" if I have that probability, assigned rather than wait until it's like 90% or something before saying my probability.\" His <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/q4MXBzzrE6bnDHJbM/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims?commentId=FWvq3afZFEo6KgMgK\">response</a> to Nonlinear's rebuttal makes the reasonable-sounding statement that he plans to compare factual claims to those in his piece and update inaccuracies, but a high tolerance for spreading falsehoods is built into his process. Correction is the bare minimum of damage control after spreading damaging falsehoods, not prudence following a pattern of prudence.</p><h3>Better processes are both possible and necessary</h3><p>Oliver explicitly <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims?commentId=fuP8ETtJmquf2iaWo\">disputes the journalistic standard</a>. He <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/q4MXBzzrE6bnDHJbM/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims?commentId=FdSJsQy2p29BYGjyD\">asserts</a> that the \"approximate result of [the standard I ask] is that [they] would have never been able to publish.\" When I pushed back, he <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/q4MXBzzrE6bnDHJbM/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims?commentId=jwCQiZFjAvtgotmGv\">encouraged me</a> \"to talk to any investigative reporter with experience in the field and ask them whether [my] demands here are at all realistic for anyone working in the space.\"</p><p>I agree that they would never have been able to publish a list of unsubstantiated rumors, and consider that a good thing: to quote a friend, a healthy community does not spread rumors about every time someone felt mistreated. But I emphatically disagree that they would never have been able to publish anything at all. I would never think to hold them to a standard I do not hold myself to.</p><p>As reassurance, Oliver <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/q4MXBzzrE6bnDHJbM/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims?commentId=FdSJsQy2p29BYGjyD\">cites</a> how their investigative efforts are a \"vast and far outlier,\" both in the realm of willingness to pay sources<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvheeimif0mh\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvheeimif0mh\">[12]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and \"on the dimension of gathering contradicting evidence.\"<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7pvhz75huaf\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7pvhz75huaf\">[13]</a></sup></span></p><p>He is technically correct: they are indeed an outlier. Just not, unfortunately, in the way he intends.</p><p>I am not a journalist. The only time in my life I have been paid to write, or indeed have sought payment for that writing, was in Scott's <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/09/26/adversarial-collaboration-contest-results/\">2018 Adversarial Collaboration Contest</a>. When I write, I do so in my spare time in quiet corners of the internet, often out of the motivation that only comes when Someone Is Wrong On The Internet and when by all rights I should be doing something else. Some of the topics I focus on read as bizarrely trivial on their face rather than the world-saving EAs prefer to focus on, as with <a href=\"https://tracingwoodgrains.substack.com/p/rantiwork-a-tragedy-of-sanewashing\">my detailed account of the fall of r/antiwork</a> and <a href=\"https://tracingwoodgrains.substack.com/p/when-punch-a-nazi-goes-wrong\">the backstory behind a viral moment of a pirate furry hitting someone with a megaphone</a>. <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/06/30/the-lottery-of-fascinations/\">We all have our fascinations</a>.</p><p>Consider that latter article. The \"antagonists\" were not particularly communicative, but I reached out to them multiple times, including right before publication, checking if I could ask questions and asking them to review my claims about them for accuracy. I went to the person closest to them who was informed on the situation and got as much information as I could from them. I spent hours talking with my primary sources, the victim and his boyfriend, and collecting as much hard evidence as possible. I spent a long time weighing which points were material and which would just serve to stir up and uncover old drama. Parties claimed I was making major material errors at several points during the process, and I dug into their claims as thoroughly as I could and asked for all available evidence to verify. Often, the disputes they claimed were material hinged on dissatisfaction with framing.</p><p>All sources were, mutually, worried about retribution and vitriol from the other parties involved.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefmh2cb0ueiv\"><sup><a href=\"#fnmh2cb0ueiv\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;All sources were part of the same niche subculture spaces, all had interacted many times over the past half-decade, mostly unhappily, and all had complicated, ugly backstories.</p><p>From my conclusion to that story:</p><blockquote><p>The obscurity became its own justification. Little tragedies happen all the time and are forgotten by the broader world as quickly as they arise. [...] In the end, I pursued this story for a simple reason: nobody else would. If people are to become outcasts among outcasts, to have their names and faces forever tied to allegations of behavior and beliefs so heinous they justify ostracization and physical assault, the least they deserve is someone willing to tell their story.</p></blockquote><p>I did this in my spare time, of my own initiative, while balancing a full law school schedule. I approached it with care, with seriousness, and with full understanding of the reputational effects I expected it to have and the evidence I had backing and justifying those effects. Writing about someone means taking on a duty to them, <i>particularly</i> if you write to condemn them.</p><p>There is no threshold for hours of engagement. The test is accuracy. If you are receiving or seem likely to receive new material facts that contradict elements of your narrative, you are not ready to publish.</p><p>I want to pause for a moment on this: I spend hours upon hours verifying obscure trivia in niche stories with minuscule real-world impact. This obsession is hardly a virtue, but the standards of truth-seeking I demand are not too onerous\u2014not for a story about internet nonsense, and certainly not for a controversy that could change the course of lives.</p><p>My own credibility is limited by my amateur status and relative inexperience. I'm not an investigative reporter, much as I LARP as one online.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefqi7ver950hj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnqi7ver950hj\">[15]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Since my job puts me in close proximity to them, though, Oliver and I worked together to write a hypothetical to pose to experienced journalists, in line with his challenge to me, with our opposite expectations preregistered. I don't endorse the hypothetical as a fully accurate summary of what happened, but agreed that it was close enough to get worthwhile answers.</p><p>The hypothetical we came up with:</p><blockquote><p>Say you were advising someone on a story they'd been working on for six months aimed at presenting an expos\u00e9 of a group their sources were confident was doing harm. They'd contacted dozens of people, cross-checked stories, and did extensive independent research over the course of hundreds of hours.</p><p>Their sources, who will be anonymous but realistically identifiable in the article, express serious concerns about retribution and request a known-in-advance publication date.</p><p>They have talked to the group they are investigating multiple times to gather evidence, but have not informed them that they are planning to release an expos\u00e9 with the evidence they gathered. 7 days before their scheduled publication date they contact the group and inform them about their intent to publish and the key claims they are planning to include in their expos\u00e9.</p><p>The group claims that several points in their article are materially wrong and libelous and asks for another week to compile evidence to rebut those claims, growing increasingly frantic as the publication date approaches and escalating to a threat of a libel suit.</p><p>On the last day before publication, they show a draft to another person close to the story who points out a detail that does not directly contradict anything in the post, but seems indirectly implied to be false, which they correct in the final publication. Then with two hours to go before the scheduled publication, the same contact provides evidence against one of the statements made in the post, though also does not definitely disprove it.</p><p>Would you advise them to publish the article in its current form, or delay publication, despite the credible requests about the sources about retribution and the promise of the scheduled publication date?</p></blockquote><p>I posed that hypothetical as written, with a brief, neutral leadup, to several journalists.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjiv4d9pzh5q\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjiv4d9pzh5q\">[16]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Ultimately, I received three answers, two from my bosses and one from Helen Lewis of <i>The Atlantic</i>. I understand if people would prefer to discount the answers from my bosses due to my working relationship with them, but I believe the framing and lack of context positioned all three well to consider the question in the abstract and on the merits independent of any connections. None were aware of the actual story in advance of answering, only the hypothetical as presented, and none of their answers should be taken as positions on the actual sequence of events.</p><p>First, from Katie Herzog, who formerly wrote for <a href=\"https://www.thestranger.com/authors/24847206/katie-herzog\">The Stranger</a> and currently cohosts the podcast <a href=\"https://www.blockedandreported.org/\">Blocked and Reported</a>:</p><blockquote><p>I would delay publication. I\u2019m not sure about the specifics of libel law but putting myself in a publisher\u2019s shoes, they do tend to not want to get sued and your first commitment, beyond getting the scoop or even stopping the hypothetical group from doing harm, should be towards accuracy.</p></blockquote><p>Oliver requested I clarify that the concern is solely ethical responsibility, not lawsuits. When I asked whether it mattered, she responded:</p><blockquote><p>[I]t doesn't, really. [A]ccuracy is paramount under threat of legal action or not.</p></blockquote><p>Second, from Jesse Singal, formerly of <a href=\"https://nymag.com/author/jesse-singal/\">NYMag</a> with bylines in many outlets, author of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Quick-Fix-Psychology-Cant-Social/dp/0374239800\">The Quick Fix: Why Fad Psychology Can't Cure Our Social Ills </a>and cohost of <a href=\"https://www.blockedandreported.org/\">Blocked and Reported</a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>I think it depends a lot on the group's ability to provide evidence the investigators' claims are wrong. In a situation like that I would <i>really</i>&nbsp;press them on the specifics. They should be able to provide evidence fairly quickly. You don't want a libel suit but you also don't want to let them indefinitely delay the publication of an article that will be damaging to them. It is a tricky situation! I am not sure an investigative reporter would&nbsp;be able to help much more simply because what you're providing is a pretty vague account, though I totally understand the reasons why that's necessary.</p></blockquote><p>Finally, from <i>The Atlantic</i>'s <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helen_Lewis_(journalist)\">Helen Lewis</a>, former deputy editor of the <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/\"><i>New Statesman</i></a> and author of the book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Difficult-Women/dp/1784709735\">\"Difficult Women: A history of feminism in 11 fights\"</a>:</p><blockquote><p>This feels like a good example of why you shouldn\u2019t over-promise to your sources\u2014you want a cordial relationship with them but you need boundaries too. I can definitely see a situation where you would agree to give a source a heads up once you\u2019d decided to publish \u2014 if it was a story where they\u2019d recounted a violent incident or sexual assault, or if they needed notice to stay somewhere else or watch out for hacking attempts. But I would be very wary of agreeing in advance when I would publish an investigation\u2014it isn\u2019t done until it\u2019s done.</p><p>In the end the story is going out under your name, and you will face the legal and ethical consequences, so you can\u2019t publish until you\u2019re satisfied. If the sources are desperate to make the information public, they can make a statement on social media. Working with a journalist involves a trade-off: in exchange for total control, you get greater credibility, plausible deniability and institutional legal protection. If I wasn\u2019t happy with a story against a ticking clock, I wouldn\u2019t be pressured into publication. That\u2019s a huge risk of libelling the subjects of the piece and trashing your professional reputation.</p><p>On the request for more time for right to reply, that\u2019s a judgement call\u2014is this a fair period for the allegations involved, or time wasting? It\u2019s not unknown for journalists to put in a right to reply on serious allegations, and the subject ask for more time, and then try to get ahead of the story by breaking it themselves (by denying it).</p></blockquote><p>You don't even have to look as far as my examples, though. To his credit, Oliver <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/q4MXBzzrE6bnDHJbM/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims?commentId=6aRaBeN7TKhaNECQ7\">repeatedly</a> <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/H4DYehKLxZ5NpQdBC/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims?commentId=5MLPKedkNdcwkyDcr\">asked</a> for better examples of what to do in similar situations. To the credit of the rationalist community, it contains some of those examples. To Oliver's discredit, however, he had full awareness of one better example, as his response to allegations of community misconduct was one of its subjects of investigation.</p><p>Last year, a rationalist meetup organizer faced accusations of misconduct, Oliver and his wife Claire (who was in charge of meetup organization as a whole) banned him from an event, he objected, and Claire agreed to be bound by a community investigation. One principle used in that investigation is worth highlighting:</p><blockquote><p>Anyone accused of misconduct should promptly be informed of any accusations made against them and given an opportunity to tell their side of the story, present evidence, and propose witnesses. Emergency preliminary actions should be taken where allegations are sufficiently serious and credible, but the accused should be given an opportunity to defend themselves as quickly as possible.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7n9mnmzsc9\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7n9mnmzsc9\">[17]</a></sup></span></p></blockquote><p>In the end, the team writing the report highlighted several specific allegations against its primary subject before including a telling line:</p><blockquote><p>We were unable to substantiate any other allegations made against [redacted]. At his request, we are not repeating unsubstantiated allegations in this document.</p></blockquote><p>A prudent decision.</p><h3>On Lawsuits</h3><p>One of the strongest and most universal sentiments shared in response to Ben's post was that threatening a lawsuit was completely unacceptable. A <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH/sharing-information-about-nonlinear?commentId=uw4HZMXGKAsTmhqxX\">notable example</a>:</p><blockquote><p>More confidently than anything on this list, <strong>Nonlinear's threatening to sue Lightcone for Ben's post is completely unacceptable</strong>, decreases my sympathy for them by about 98%, and strongly updates me in the direction that refusing to give in to their requested delay was the right decision. In my view, it is quite a strong update that the negative portrayal of Emerson Spartz in the OP is broadly correct. I don't think we as a community should tolerate this, and I applaud Lightcone for refusing to give in to such heavy-handed coercion.</p></blockquote><p>I get the skepticism, but no matter how much you dislike defamation lawsuits, you should like actual defamation less.</p><p>Earlier, I linked to a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH/sharing-information-about-nonlinear?commentId=kfmznomo758chjuHx\">comment</a> emphasizing distrust in established code of professions in favor of another standard: \"this group thought about this a lot and underwent a lot of trial by fire and came up with these specific guidelines, and I can articulate the costs and benefits of individual rules.\"</p><p>I am not a romantic about the law. It is an unwieldy, bloated beast that puts people through the wringer even when they win. The powerful can wield it against the weak. It is selectively enforced, in what feel at times like all the worst moments.</p><p>In common law countries, though, it is something else as well: the result of collective society thinking a lot, undergoing a lot of trial by fire, and coming up with specific guidelines to bring people as close as possible to being made whole again after they suffer injustices we have collectively deemed to be intolerable. The <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Posner\">best judges</a> understand precisely what the law is:</p><blockquote><p>A case is just a dispute. The first thing you do is ask yourself\u2014forget about the law\u2014what is a sensible resolution of this dispute? The next thing ... is to see if a recent Supreme Court precedent or some other legal obstacle stood in the way of ruling in favor of that sensible resolution. And the answer is that's actually rarely the case.</p></blockquote><p>The common law is, for the most part, pleasantly intuitive. I like to say it's all vibes. A great deal of common law hinges on the \"reasonable person\" standard, either explicitly or implicitly: is it sensible to do this? Good. Then do it. Is it unreasonable? Then don't.</p><p>The court of law is, in short and aspirationally, a last-ditch way to force people to right wrongs without escalating to force. Few disputes reach the point of lawsuits. Fewer still make it past discovery and into trials without settlements. Yet fewer see dueling parties fight bitterly up the chain of appeals. Throughout the cases I read as a first-semester law student, a message drilled in by judge after judge throughout history is that nobody wants to see the inside of a court. If you can handle wrongs in your life on your own, not even the judges want you there.</p><p>Threats of lawsuits are fundamentally different to other threats. They are, as <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/nathan?mention=user\">@Nathan Young</a> put it, <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/q4MXBzzrE6bnDHJbM/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims?commentId=c5hcfihFjrLhvvZmq\">bets</a> that the other party is so wrong you're willing to expend both of your time and money to demonstrate it. Rationalists are fond of <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/NCefvet6X3Sd4wrPc/uncritical-supercriticality\">Yudkowsky's line</a>: \"Bad argument gets counterargument. Does not get bullet. Never. Never ever never for ever.\" If it can be had nowhere else, the court is the way to get that counterargument, and I concur with <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/daystar-eld?mention=user\">@Daystar Eld</a> <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/q4MXBzzrE6bnDHJbM/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims?commentId=xwBpfEPBtd2Q2gzH6\">that</a> people should not be \"shunned, demonized, etc for threatening to use a very core right that they're entitled to.\"</p><p>Making firm statements about the law when I am not a lawyer is perilous, and the legal paper I had to write outlining the ways lawyers can get sued for malpractice for casual false advice to friends is fresh in my mind. Still, my impression is that many here misunderstand libel law somewhat, and the actual standard is worth clarifying. I'll start with a <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/q4MXBzzrE6bnDHJbM/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims?commentId=y3AP5N8xYcxc3eHqd\">comment</a> from Oliver:</p><blockquote><p>The original post is really quite careful in its epistemic status and in clearly referencing to sources claiming something. You could run this by a lawyer with experience in libel law, and I think they would conclude that a suit did not have much of a chance of success.</p></blockquote><p><strong>I will make no specific legal claims about the original post.</strong> Inasmuch as I am interested in the legal standard, it is primarily as a baseline for the ethical standard. It's worth examining, however, the standards of defamation law.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Referencing claims made by specific sources:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Under Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 578, a broadly but not universally accepted summation of common law torts, someone who repeats defamatory material from someone else is liable to the same extent as if they were the original publisher, even if they mention the name of the original source and state they do not believe the claim. Claims of belief or disbelief, while not determinative, come into play when determining damages.</p><p>Two Supreme Court cases, <a href=\"https://www.casebriefs.com/blog/law/torts/torts-keyed-to-epstein/defamation/st-amant-v-thompson/\"><i>St. Amant v. Thompson</i>, 390 U.S. 727 (1968)</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harte-Hanks_Communications,_Inc._v._Connaughton\"><i>Harte-Hanks Communications, Inc. v. Connaughton</i>, 491 U.S. 657 (1989)</a>, showcase how people can be liable solely for repeating someone else's defamatory claims. In <i>St. Amant</i>, a politician who read his own questions and someone else's false answers in an interview was found not liable only because actual malice could not be proven. In <i>Harte-Hanks</i>, a newspaper was found liable for libel solely for quoting a witness who falsely claimed she was offered a bribe in exchange for favorable testimony.</p><p><strong>Epistemic uncertainty:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Restatement (Second) of Torts \u00a7 566 touches on expressions of opinion, clarifying that opinions are actionable to the extent they are based on express or implied defamatory factual claims.</p><p>Per <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milkovich_v._Lorain_Journal_Co.\"><i>Milkovich v. Lorain Journal Co.</i>, 497 U.S. 1 (1990)</a>, opinions that rest on factual claims (e.g. \"In my opinion John Jones is a liar\") can imply assertions of objective fact, and connotations that are susceptible to being proven true or false can still be considered. Opinions are not privileged in a way fundamentally distinct from facts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In short, you do not dodge liability for defamation by attributing beliefs to your sources or by clarifying you don't know whether an accusation is true.&nbsp;</p><p>Lawsuit threats are distinctly unfriendly. Here's another thing that's distinctly unfriendly: publishing libelous information likely to do irreparable damage to an organization without giving them the opportunity to proactively correct falsehoods. The legal system is a way of systematizing responses to that sort of unfriendliness. It is not kind, it is not pleasant, but it is a legitimate response to a calculated decision to inflict enormous reputational harm.</p><p>At the time Nonlinear threatened legal action, they honestly believed that they were about to be libeled and that they had hard material evidence that would be sufficient to prove that libel in a court of law. They may be correct, they may be incorrect, but at the time they made that threat they were already on trial, with Ben Pace as prosecutor and judge alike, and no defense attorney to be found.</p><p>A threat of legal action in a circumstance like that should serve not as a defection from a frame of cooperation, but as a reminder that you are already in a fundamentally adversarial frame, having chosen to investigate a group over a long period of time and then publish information to damage them. It should serve as a warning: not \"get this information out immediately at all cost,\" but \"If you cannot deescalate, someone will win here and someone will lose. Dot every i. Cross every t. Make your own behavior <i>unimpeachable</i>, because every action you take will be under strict scrutiny.\"</p><p>The adversarial frame began when Alice and Chloe began sharing rumors about Nonlinear that people used to justify changing their behavior around the company members without verifying with them. It continued when Lightcone elected to spend six months digging up all possible negative information about them, when they reached out with a publication date already set, and when they refused to delay publication a moment to allow counter-evidence. At no stage can this be said to have been a collaborative process.</p><p>If your goal is to reveal the truth and not to inflict harm on someone, you should wait until you have all sides as thoroughly as you can reasonably get them, not cut that process short when the party you are making allegations against responds with understandable antagonism\u2014until and unless they refuse to cooperate further and have no more useful information to give.</p><h3>First Principles, Duty, and Harm</h3><p>The EA/LW community loves to think from first principles, and that is usually one of its finest traits. I notice and respect the times their first-principles thinking leads them to be correct about things broader society is incorrect about\u2014a regular occurrence. Occasionally, though, this manifests in a way satirized by <a href=\"https://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?db=comics&amp;id=2556\">SMBC</a> and many others: confidence that they can outperform others from first principles leading them to make painfully predictable missteps in other fields.</p><p>It would be hypocritical of me to criticize the desire to do amateur investigative journalism, to be the one to show up and do things where others do not. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH/sharing-information-about-nonlinear?commentId=92HxmNbpoiEjdmcxm\">Ben Pace</a>, in defending his decision to write his article, used a quote from Eliezer Yudkowsky I am also fond of:</p><blockquote><p>But if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned in life, it\u2019s that the important things are accomplished not by those best suited to do them, or by those who ought to be responsible for doing them, but by whoever actually shows up.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/tracewoodgrains/status/1711050089282621789\">When you say \"I want to make the world a better place,\" though, you add an implicit \"I want power and should be trusted with it.\"</a> People should do good, say things worth saying, and get involved in causes that matter to them, but every time they do so, they enmesh themselves in a web of responsibilities. The assertion of power is neither trivial nor costless. I do more amateur investigative work than almost anyone else I know of, without formal training, often without pay, and without any stamp of approval from a profession, and Lightcone has and should have the same privilege.

This describes a failure state of rationalism, I think, but certainly not the central case. He is rightly unpopular around here and I hesitate to give further life to his metaphor by extending it, but in seeing rationalists reinvent the pettiest and most destructive subculture drama I find everywhere else from first principles, all while working to be even-handed and earnest, I have thought of nothing so much as a quokka with a machine gun.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:62.8%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/bwtpBFQXKaGxuic6Q/ppka86p3hy8yyoey77wx\"></figure><p>Ben's post, in all honesty, seems na\u00efve: that if you just state you only looked for the negative, people will add it to a carefully balanced judgment rather than treat it as a complete picture; that if you share negative information about someone and the truth comes out later people will simply update and the original damage is undone; that uncertainty about whether someone has done an awful thing should be handled the same way as other public uncertainty\u2014that you can, in short, write a hit piece full of unverified gossip and rumors, but Rational.</p><p>That is not flattering, it is not kind, but it is what I see in this saga: First-principles thinking without sufficient consideration towards harm, brushing aside the safeguards people have felt out over centuries of building the common law and codes of ethics. Pure harm, in a sense. Innocent, well-meaning, earnest harm. But harm nonetheless.</p><h3>What of Nonlinear?</h3><p>Effective Altruists wish to avoid adjudicating truth claims in court and believe they can and should do better in-house. Very well, but you would do well to adopt some choices from the courts in that process.</p><p>Lightcone elected to try Nonlinear in the court of public opinion, putting the question of their reputation to a jury of their peers. They did so by means of a post that was openly biased and contained a wide range of falsehoods for which they concede <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/q4MXBzzrE6bnDHJbM/nonlinear-s-evidence-debunking-false-and-misleading-claims?commentId=5fpWETE4QaDb9vuKu\">slight, if any, fault</a>. They offered no semblance of due process, providing a single three-hour phone call to respond to six months of work and declining to examine any further exculpatory evidence. Their post, embraced and accepted by their community, caused immense and irrevocable material harm to Nonlinear. The community had a chance to notice and proactively correct those flaws. It did not and indeed dismissed those who raised them. CEA <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/32LMQsjEMm6NK2GTH/sharing-information-about-nonlinear?commentId=PyyPM7TxZ9hfEj36w\">noticed and endorsed the trial, having likewise deliberately neglected Nonlinear's side of the story</a>.</p><p>From all of this, I find myself drawn to only one outcome: Declare a mistrial, likely at least by retracting the initial article with a public apology, the same as responsible journalists do after publishing sufficiently false articles. Was Nonlinear at fault in some of its interactions? Probably! Were they their own worst enemies in the way they responded? Certainly. Does it matter anymore? Not at all. The community mishandled this so badly and so comprehensively that inasmuch as Nonlinear made mistakes in their treatment of Chloe or Alice, for the purposes of the EA/LW community, the procedural defects have destroyed the case.</p><p>I know neither Ben nor Oliver but respect their roles in this community and think that they were acting with serious efforts to apply rationalist/EA principles, neither of which I claim the mantle of. I spent the bulk of this essay criticizing their approach in ways that necessarily come off as hostile and painful towards an investigation they poured their hearts into over the course of half a year, but I think the lack of community self-correction to that approach and the failure to heed the red flags raised by Spencer Greenberg, Geoffrey Miller, and others are an order of magnitude more serious than anything either of them did. Inasmuch as people should correct from this, I believe the community as a whole is at fault.</p><p>This is my first top-level post on the Effective Altruism forums and, surprisingly, my first on LessWrong as well. I am used to writing to adjacent communities and <a href=\"https://tracingwoodgrains.substack.com/\">in my own sphere</a>, not here. I have written at such length here, rather than elsewhere, because I fundamentally and deeply respect many of the discourse norms here. This saga damaged that respect\u2014pretty badly, in some ways\u2014and reveals what I believe to be deep-running structural flaws in this ecosystem, implicating many people I have long followed and respected, but if there is one thing I know and respect about the EA/LW community, it is that you engage seriously and carefully with criticism.&nbsp;</p><p>As a community, you go to great lengths to do good\u2014more, certainly, than I can claim. You're human, though.

comparable. I've had a lot of experience living in similar situations. During my early time in the Air Force, living and training expenses were covered in full and I was paid some $2200 a month (pay is <a href=\"https://www.airforce.com/pay-and-benefits/air-force-benefits\">public</a> if you'd like more details). This was a great situation for me and I was able to save some 90% of my salary while living comfortably and happily. Later on, though, I got to choose my housing and food and got housing and food stipends added to my salary. I chose cheaper housing and cheaper food and saved much more money as a result.</p><p>Someone wanting to describe my military compensation could do so in several ways:</p><p><br>1. Raw salary while I got no housing/food allowance, then salary + allowances afterwards. This would be the answer in terms of pure income.<br>2. Salary + equivalent value of allowances, both at the start and later. This would have relatively overstated my compensation early on compared to the first option, since I got more money in my pocket without a decline in subjective quality of life when I got money instead of housing and food.<br>3. Salary + allowances + benefits (eg free health+dental, later GI Bill, travel). This is an honest account of true compensation, probably the \"truest\" number I could choose, but it overstates the cash value of every benefit.<br>4. My cost to the military. This would be astronomically higher than my compensation given the cost of my training and upkeep. Thinking too much about this number unsettles me.</p><p><br>Nonlinear, it seems, is choosing somewhere between 3 and 4 to describe compensation. Having employees is expensive, more so when you want them to travel with you. Not all costs to you are reflected in their take-home pay. Military enlistment is not traditionally considered a high-paying career, but an E-1 fresh out of high school makes more take-home pay than Chloe did. That said, claims about military pay aside, I felt my own compensation was extraordinarily generous at every stage of my time in the Air Force.&nbsp;</p><p>My Mormon mission provides another basis of comparison. At the time I served, every two-year missionary paid $10,000 for the experience. From there, every cost was fully covered by the mission, with a small (few hundred dollar) stipend for food and incidentals that we still conceptualized as \"the Lord's money.\" Costs to the LDS church vary wildly by mission location, but it would be odd to describe those costs as compensation at all. I did not and do not consider this structure abusive. Though I left Mormonism afterwards, my mission was the key formative experience of my life, with some of the worst and best experiences I've had and exposure to a slice of the world I had no other way to experience.&nbsp;</p><p>I think Nonlinear should have avoided putting a value estimate on benefits since that anchors expectations in an unproductive way, instead simply describing the benefits and letting people work it out for themselves.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnz5nlmd6fxs\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a

We suspect many in the EA community already agree that groundbreaking innovations are often&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_drift#Rejection_of_Wegener's_theory,_1910s%E2%80%931950s\"><u>found</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignaz_Semmelweis#Conflict_with_established_medical_opinion\"><u>in</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mendelian_inheritance#History\"><u>some</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helicobacter_pylori#History\"><u>highly</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prion\"><u>unexpected</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/nature05913\"><u>places</u></a>, seeming to many as implausible,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.paulgraham.com/heresy.html\"><u>heretical</u></a>, or otherwise far-fetched\u2014until they work.</p><h2><strong>\u2026but what are these neglected approaches?</strong></h2><h3><i>Your neglected approach ideas</i></h3><p>We think we have some potentially promising hypotheses. But because we know you do, too, we are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeU1_dZapdxH5SIooC3VK7nbnKSCZxxGG1JuqeNDpTOa22xbA/viewform?usp=sf_link\"><u>actively soliciting input from the alignment community</u></a>. We will be more formally pursuing this initiative in the near future, awarding some small prizes to the most promising expert-reviewed suggestions.

This is a contest for ideas, not for implementation).&nbsp;</p><h3><i>Our neglected approach ideas</i></h3><p>To be clear about our big-picture goal: we want to ensure that if/when we live in a world with superintelligent AI whose behavior is\u2014likely by definition\u2014outside our direct control, this AI (at the very least) does not destroy humanity and (ideally) dramatically increases the agency and flourishing of conscious entities.&nbsp;</p><p>Accordingly, the following list presents a set of ten ideas that we think (1) have some reasonable probability of contributing to the realization of this vision, (2) have not been explored satisfactorily, and (3) we could meaningfully contribute to actualizing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Important caveats</strong></p><ul><li>Please consider this set of ideas something far more like \u2018AE\u2019s evolving, first-pass best guesses at promising neglected alignment approaches\u2019 rather than \u2018AE\u2019s official alignment agenda.\u2019&nbsp;</li><li>Please also note that these are our ideas, not concrete implementation plans. While we think we might have a comparative advantage in pursuing some of the following agendas, we do not think this is likely to be the case across the board; we see the following ideas as generally-interesting, definitely-neglected, alignment-related agendas\u2014<strong>even if we aren\u2019t the specific group that is best suited to implement all of them.</strong></li><li>One meta-approach we are exploring involves quantitatively identifying neglected approaches, such as analyzing a very large&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/moirage/alignment-research-dataset\"><u>natural language dataset</u></a> of alignment research.

With AE's background in BCI, neuroscience, and machine learning, we feel well-equipped to make tangible progress in this research direction.<ol><li>We are currently actively working on operationalizing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17375\"><u>attention schema theory</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32064522/\"><u>self-other overlap</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://compdevlab.yale.edu/docs/2019/ToM_as_IRL_2019.pdf\"><u>theory of mind</u></a> for RL- and LLM-based agents as mechanisms for facilitating prosocial cognition. Brain-based approaches to AI have proven to be generally successful for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nNbnzegz7ppewZgCG/ai-researchers-announce-neuroai-agenda\"><u>AI capabilities research</u></a>, and we (along with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/Ft0gTO2K85A?si=V3EGJ-CQxxtnAfUX&amp;t=2171\"><u>many</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/5F5Tz3u6kJbTNMqsb/intro-to-brain-like-agi-safety-13-symbol-grounding-and-human\"><u>others</u></a>) think the same is likely to be true for AI safety. We are interested in testing the hypothesis that prosocial learning algorithms are more performant and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/RichardSSutton/status/1728129341287198885\"><u>scalable</u></a> as compared to default approaches. We also think that creating and/or facilitating the development of relevant benchmarks and datasets might be a very high leverage subproject associated with this approach.</li><li>Though we are aware that current models of human prosociality are far from perfect, we believe that the associated scientific literature is a largely untapped source of inspiration both for (1) what sort of incentives and mechanisms make agents prosocial, and (2) under what conditions prosociality robustly contributes to aligned behavior. We think this existing work is likely to inspire novel alignment approaches in spite of the certainly-still-imperfect nature of computational cognitive neuroscience.</li><li>Best guesses for why this might be neglected:<ol><li>We speculate that there may be a tendency to conflate (1) the extraction of the best alignment-relevant insights from cognitive neuroscience (we support this), with (2) the assumption that AGI will mimic the human brain (we don\u2019t think this is likely), or (3) the idea that we already have perfect models from current neuroscience of how prosociality works (this is empirically not true), or (4) that we should in all cases try to replicate the social behavior of human brains in AI (we think this is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/yKgai84JhFmCkWQ8R/alignment-via-prosocial-brain-algorithms#Plausible_critique__1__Human_value_based_cognition_moral_reasoning_ain_t_all_that__\"><u>unwise</u></a> and unsafe)\u2014all of which has needlessly limited the extent to which (1) has been pursued.&nbsp;</li><li>Additionally, the alignment community's strong foundation in mathematics, computer science, and other key technical fields, while undeniably valuable, may inadvertently limit community-level exposure to the cutting edge of cognitive science research.&nbsp;</li></ol></li></ol></li><li><a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/transformative-ai-timelines-part-1-of-4-what-kind-of-ai/\"><strong><u>Transformative AI</u></strong></a><strong> \u2192 better BCI \u2192 better (human) alignment researchers</strong>: Some alignment researchers want to employ advanced AI to automate and/or rapidly advance alignment research directly (most prominently,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/introducing-superalignment\"><u>OpenAI\u2019s Superalignment agenda</u></a>). We think there is a highly neglected direction to pursue in this same vein:&nbsp;<strong>employ advanced AI to automate and/or rapidly advance BCI research. Then, use this BCI to&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://vitalik.eth.limo/general/2023/11/27/techno_optimism.html#merge\"><strong><u>dramatically augment</u></strong></a><strong> the capabilities of human alignment researchers.</strong>&nbsp;<ol><li>While this may sound somewhat outlandish, we suspect that significant scientific automation is plausible in the near future, and we want to flag that there are other potentially-very-high-value alignment directions that emerge from this breakthrough besides directly jumping to automating alignment research\u2014including automating things like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/ybmDkJAj3rdrrauuu/connectomics-seems-great-from-an-ai-x-risk-perspective\"><u>connectomics/whole brain emulation</u></a>. (Incidentally, we also think it's worth considering various other benefits of transformative AI for a safer post-AGI future, such as effectively encrypting human DNA with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-023-05824-z\"><u>unique DNA codons</u></a> to combat biorisk.)&nbsp;</li><li>It is also worth noting that augmenting the capabilities of human alignment researchers does not necessarily require transformative BCI; to this end, we are currently investigating relatively-lower-hanging psychological interventions and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://universallauncher.com/\"><u>agency-enhancing tools</u></a> that have the potential to significantly enhance the quality and quantity of individuals\u2019 cognitive output. In an ideal world (i.e., one where we can begin implementing this agenda reasonably quickly), we speculate it might be safer to empower humans to do better alignment research than AI, as empowering AI carries alignment-relevant capabilities risks that empowering humans does not (which&nbsp;<i>also</i> is not to say that empowering humans via BCI does also not have many serious risks).&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li><strong>BCI for quantitatively mapping human values</strong>: we also think that near-future-BCI may enable us to map the latent space of human values in a far more data-driven way than, for instance, encoding our values in natural language, as is the case, for instance, in Anthropic\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/index/constitutional-ai-harmlessness-from-ai-feedback\"><u>constitutional AI</u></a>.

We think that in order for this approach to be pragmatic, the increase in quality of the reward signals would have to outweigh or otherwise counterbalance the practical cost of extracting the associated brain signals.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefoosk7rlikrr\"><sup><a href=\"#fnoosk7rlikrr\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;And the general idea of using neural data as an ML training signal also need not be limited to RL\u2014we just thought RLNF sounded pretty cool.</li><li><strong>Provably safe architectures</strong>:<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2u9uvh50m87\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2u9uvh50m87\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;we see significant potential to help amplify, expedite, and scale the deployment of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01933\"><u>provably safe architectures</u></a>, including&nbsp;potentially promising examples like <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pKSmEkSQJsCSTK6nH/an-open-agency-architecture-for-safe-transformative-ai\"><u>open agency architectures</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08381.pdf\"><u>inductive program synthesis</u></a> (e.g., DreamCoder), and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://probmods.org/\"><u>other</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/ngEvKav9w57XrGQnb/cognitive-emulation-a-naive-ai-safety-proposal\"><u>similar</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3314221.3314638\"><u>frameworks</u></a> that draw on insights from cognitive neuroscience.

We are currently exploring the possibility of hiring someone with a strong policy background to help facilitate this: while we have received positive feedback on this general idea from those who know significantly more about the policy space than we do, we are very sensitive to the potential for a shortsighted or naive implementation of this to be highly harmful to AI safety policy.

This implies\u2014at least in our simplified model\u2014that even with low individual probabilities, a sufficiently large number of neglected approaches can collectively hold a high chance of including a crucial solution in expectation. For instance, in a world with 100 neglected approaches and a probability of 99% that each approach is not key (i.e., a <a href=\"https://ae.studio/blog/flourishing-of-perspective-scale-and-ae\">1% likelihood</a> of pushing the needle on alignment), there\u2019s still about a 63% chance that one of these approaches would be crucial; with 1000 approaches and a probability of 99% that each approach is not key, the probability rises to over 99% that one will be pivotal. This simple model motivates us to think it makes sense to take many shots on goal, pursuing as many plausible neglected alignment agendas as possible.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnc0h3mczkoof\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefc0h3mczkoof\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;Please note: (1) we are primarily interested in aggregating the best ideas to begin, so don\u2019t worry if you have an idea that you think fits the criteria above but is challenging to implement/you wouldn\u2019t want to actually implement it.

Luckily, our arguments largely complement each other, which is nicely symbolic of the whole debate.</i></p><p>In summary:</p><ul><li>AI ethics is more focused on existing problems, AI safety on those arising in the near future. Since these communities build on different intellectual traditions, they view AI risks through different aesthetics.<ul><li>&nbsp;E.g. AI safety speaks in terms of utility functions, agents and incentives, AI ethics speaks in terms of fairness or accountability.</li></ul></li><li>In terms of policy recommendations, these differences don't seem to matter. Unfortunately, the combination of political attention with the tough competition within academia and Big Tech involvement heighten suspicion and incentivize the creation of intellectual coalitions that often form around aesthetics, as the simplest common denominator.<ul><li>This may lead to the feeling that people focused on different problems <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/NfgMAS67nKTGzmQMB/x-distracts-from-y-as-a-thinly-disguised-fight-over-group\">divert attention</a> from what's really important</li></ul></li><li>However, this micropolitics masks the fact that, in practice, AI ethics and AI safety are highly complimentary and both benefit from the shared spotlight of attention.</li><li><strong>This was well demonstrated with the EU AI act, as:</strong><ol><li>The act demonstrated there is a consensus on the meta-principles that should guide AI policy.<ol><li>Particularly the principle that AI developers need to provide sufficient evidence that they are taking reasonable measures to ensure that their technology is beneficial</li><li>Therefore, there doesn't need to be an agreement regarding p(doom). If it's obvious that an advanced AI is extremely unlikely to cause a catastrophe, it should be easy to demonstrate. In such a case, the policy rightfully wouldn't slow AI development down. However, if an AI has destructive capabilities and there aren't arguments or experiments that can demonstrate safety, it's good if regulation poses an obstacle to its development.</li></ol></li><li>The act demonstrated the two perspectives offer different reasons for a plethora of important policies.<ol><li>Both safety and fairness requires a corporate governance that ensures transparent, controllable algorithms and a practical accountability of digital firms</li><li>Both perspectives highlight the harms caused by the social power of social media, addictions, manipulation, surveillance, social credit systems or autonomous weapons</li></ol></li><li>The act demonstrated that the increased attention around AI risks gives weight to the voices from both sides.<ol><li>Studies suggest that mentioning <i>scientific uncertainty&nbsp;</i>(one stemming from known gaps in knowledge) and <i>technical uncertainty&nbsp;</i>(one inherent to statistical models) in science communication has neutral or positive effects on the trust of the source. However, <i>consensus uncertainty, </i>stemming from differences in opinions, has clearly negative effects towards both sides of a debate, particularly if it's heated. Importantly, it's a question of framing whether uncertainty stems from a gap in knowledge or differences among scientists. Therefore, merely friendlier relationships seem beneficial, in order to promote policies in the intersection, as not knowing who to trust fosters inaction.</li><li>In practice, we might have witnessed this when a group of MEPs wrote their <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/technology/eu-lawmakers-call-political-attention-powerful-ai-2023-04-17/\">own version</a> of the FLI open letter, which possibly sped up the EU AI act, even though the group's members expressed skepticism towards the FLI letter x-risk concerns. This may have been allowed by the FLI's letter openness towards both AI ethics and AI safety-based concerns.</li></ol></li></ol></li><li>I ran a tiny survey (n=82) to explore the effects of interaction of AI safety and AI ethics attitudes. I found out the concern for AI safety and AI bias also correlated positively (r = .28). More importantly, when respondents were first asked to think about AI safety, their concern regarding AI bias was not lower in any of the measured dimensions (perceived significance, support for policy, support of research funding) - and vice versa. The interaction effect was only significant in one direction - people who were first asked about AI safety reported higher support for policy targeting AI bias (\u00df = .23).</li><li>More evidence based on web interest and themes of other policy &amp; funding initiatives in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/hXzB72kfdAk6PTzio/attention-on-existential-risk-from-ai-likely-hasn-t\">Erich's post</a></li></ul>", "user": {"username": "Daniel_Friedrich"}}, {"_id": "p6Wccw2Gg3ESLMvRr", "title": "OpenAI: Preparedness framework", "postedAt": "2023-12-18T18:30:10.973Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "zsp"}}, {"_id": "KYzbvbaF65kNFYFG3", "title": "Project proposal: Scenario analysis group for AI safety strategy", "postedAt": "2023-12-18T18:31:23.024Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>This is a blog post, not a research report, meaning it was produced quickly and is not to Rethink Priorities\u2019 typical standards of substantiveness and careful checking for accuracy.</i></p><h1>Summary</h1><p>This post contains a proposal for a scenario analysis group for AI safety strategy.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>The group would identify important scenarios</strong> (in the form of changes to the strategic landscape for AI safety and governance that might happen over the next ~5 years),<strong> conduct scenario analysis</strong> to identify actions to take now to prepare for such scenarios, and<strong> share recommendations&nbsp;</strong>with organizations aiming to reduce existential risk from AI.

(See some of the other projects we\u2019ve thought about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/longtermism-research-notes/concrete-projects-for-reducing-existential-risk\"><u>here</u></a>.)</li><li><strong>I\u2019m not necessarily proposing setting up a new organization</strong>; I think this project could easily be run within an existing organization (and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/P55P4YJoncfQmZ2RR/downsides-of-small-organizations-in-ea\"><u>there are likely benefits to doing so</u></a>).</li></ul><h1>What\u2019s the impact story?</h1><ul><li><strong>The community of people focused on addressing catastrophic and existential risks from AI (from now on \u201cthe AIXR community\u201d) is in a unique position to influence how well the world navigates AI risk</strong>, due to having foresight of (some of) the specific risks to come and potentially having levers to influence key actors.</li><li><strong>The strategic landscape with respect to AI risk has changed rapidly in the past few years</strong> \u2013 with rapidly improving model capabilities and increased public attention after the release of ChatGPT \u2013&nbsp;<strong>and will likely continue to do so in the coming years.</strong></li><li><strong>Given this, the AIXR community needs to ensure that its plans are robust to potential future strategic changes</strong>&nbsp;and that it is prepared to take advantage of the opportunities offered by those changes.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>It\u2019s possible to, ahead of time, identify levers, resources, areas of expertise, and key uncertainties </strong>that will be important in a wide range of (or in particularly high-priority) potential future scenarios, and doing so will allow investment in these ahead of time.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>This kind of analysis is likely to be an undersupplied public good</strong>, since it benefits the community as a whole more than it benefits any individual organization, giving individual organizations insufficient incentive to invest in it.</li><li><strong>Having a third party team dedicated to this would help ensure that there\u2019s</strong>&nbsp;<strong>a clear owner for this kind of work</strong>&nbsp;<strong>and that there\u2019s sufficient coordination between different actors</strong>. I\u2019m sure some degree of scenario analysis is already informing thinking in places that have high leverage over the strategy of the AIXR community (e.g., OpenPhil), though I don\u2019t have a great sense of the extent. But I\u2019m not aware of any projects explicitly focused on this (list of projects I\u2019m aware of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/KYzbvbaF65kNFYFG3/project-proposal-scenario-analysis-group-for-ai-safety#Appendix_2__Existing_crisis_planning_related_projects_I_m_aware_of\"><u>here</u></a>).</li></ul><h1>What would the team do?</h1><p>The team I have in mind would focus on the following two activities (at least initially):</p><ol><li><strong>Scenario analysis:&nbsp;</strong>Flesh out a high-priority scenario, analyze what the optimal response from AIXR-focused organizations would look like, and gather information on how these organizations would in fact respond. Compare different scenarios to identify commonly occurring gaps and proactively share recommendations with key actors (e.g., research question x, set up initiative y, support policy proposal z).</li><li><strong>Simulation exercises:&nbsp;</strong>Create simple simulation exercises and invite either teams from individual organizations or leadership from multiple organizations to participate, with the aim to (a) gather info to use in scenario planning, (b) raise awareness about high-priority scenarios and gaps, (c) stress test teams\u2019 and leaders\u2019 ability to work under pressure, and (d) increase familiarity and trust between different teams.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>It may be preferable to&nbsp;<i>only&nbsp;</i>do simulation exercises, at least to begin with, given the substantial time cost of creating simulation exercises and having many people in important roles spend time playing them. But I do think simulation exercises add unique value, especially in terms (c).</p><p>Longer-term, as the team gains expertise and trust, I\u2019d be interested to see it experiment with other and more ambitious crisis preparedness measures, such as managing resources reserved for crises (e.g., a regranting pool or a reservist workforce) or setting up inter-org standard operating procedures (SOPs) for various crises (e.g., robust communication channels, high-level coordinated response plans).</p><h2>Which scenarios would the team focus on?</h2><p>I imagine the team would conduct its own analysis of which scenarios are highest-impact to analyze, but here are some examples of scenarios that seem high-priority to me:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>A warning shot drastically shifts the Overton window of political action (the type of warning shot (e.g. misuse-based cyberattack, alignment scare, rapid job loss) probably matters a lot).&nbsp;</li><li>Strong evidence emerges that human-level AGI will be developed within the next year.&nbsp;</li><li>USG becomes unable to seriously regulate frontier AI for the foreseeable future (e.g. because of a scandal, a change to an administration hostile to AI safety, or polarization).</li><li>A new country (e.g. Saudi Arabia) rapidly advances towards frontier AI capabilities.</li><li>Nationalization of or significant government involvement in AI development.</li><li>US-China war breaks out.</li></ul><h2>What could a pilot look like?</h2><p>I think this project (as most projects) should likely begin with a pilot to gain more information about how valuable this project seems and about the team\u2019s fit for doing this kind of work.</p><p>A simple pilot could be to spend ~1 month analyzing and writing a report on one scenario that seems particularly high-priority to the research team. I think this would give the team a decent indication of whether they\u2019re on track to learn useful insights, both based on their own sense and stakeholder feedback. Running a pilot like this would be fairly low-cost (e.g., assuming two people are involved, it would cost 2 months\u2019 FTE in time and ~$16,000 in salaries).&nbsp;</p><p>For a rough outline of what the first year of operations could look like, see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bZCOUuzz1DHpxEag9DjRjM7VQtdR0rmP36mqmAOOo2w/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>this doc</u></a>.</p><h1>Some arguments against this proposal</h1><ol><li><strong>People who could run this project really well may well have better options.&nbsp;</strong>The best people to run this project would probably have great strategic thinking, knowledge about AI governance and safety, networks, and ideally experience with scenario analysis, e.g. from government. People with these skills would probably have great opportunities to do more direct AI governance work that might be higher-impact.</li><li><strong>Maybe it\u2019s not very tractable to discover important, well-justified new insights</strong> given that a fair amount of work has already gone into this kind of strategic thinking.</li><li><strong>It seems difficult to convene and get input from some key groups,&nbsp;</strong>including subject matter experts (who might be important for analyzing scenarios well) and leaders in the AIXR community (whose buy-in is important to the analysis making a difference).&nbsp;</li><li><strong>There are some possible downside risks, such as the leak of infohazardous or sensitive information</strong>, net negative recommendations getting implemented, or taking away focus from more important / more direct AIXR reduction work or<i>&nbsp;</i>from other similar coordination mechanisms. But I think most versions of this project are fairly low-risk.&nbsp;</li></ol><h1>Ideal team</h1><p>Characteristics that it seems especially useful to have on the team (though if you\u2019re interested, it seems worth considering this project even if you only have some of these / to some degree):</p><ul><li>Experience with scenario analysis and wargaming (e.g., from government)</li><li>Being trusted, well-networked, and considered relatively neutral in the AIXR space&nbsp;</li><li>Extensive knowledge of AI safety and governance</li><li>Great strategic thinking</li></ul><h1>Appendix 1: Alternatives I\u2019ve considered and why I ended up favoring this version instead</h1><p>These are brief descriptions of other versions of this project I considered and a rough indication of why I didn\u2019t end up favoring them over the mainline version described above.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Note that these reasons are obviously very incomplete and that my judgements here are far from confident.

When considering the quality of life of these chickens, an estimated 99% of chickens in the US are raised in factory farms. Broilers are chickens reared for meat.</p><p>The majority of broilers raised in the US are members of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rUloTYBOCuLYJyddzijUO52NcHApetgRJwO8lcRX0TU/edit#heading=h.56oypgboku5k\"><u>fast-growing breeds</u></a>, which grow at rates up to 400% faster than their natural rates. This leads to a myriad of serious welfare concerns. These animals become too heavy for their skeletons, leading to lameness, as their musculoskeletal systems cannot keep up with their rapid rates of growth. Further, due to their excessive weight, members of the fast-growing breeds spend more time sedentary, leading them to develop painful lesions which can become infected as a result of the unhygienic environments on these farms. These broilers also suffer from failures of the cardiovascular system, leading many to die prematurely from sudden death syndrome.</p><p>Although many animal advocacy organisations in the US, particularly within the Effective Animal Altruism movement, work on campaigns to improve broiler welfare by encouraging and pressuring corporations to commit to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rUloTYBOCuLYJyddzijUO52NcHApetgRJwO8lcRX0TU/edit#heading=h.d55ak3zk1zl\"><u>Better Chicken Commitment</u></a>, a set of welfare standards that reduce the suffering of broilers and mandate a transition to slower growing breeds, current progress on this has stagnated.&nbsp;</p><p>Some US states have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rUloTYBOCuLYJyddzijUO52NcHApetgRJwO8lcRX0TU/edit#heading=h.34l0ii2z8nkv\"><u>direct democracies</u></a>, where citizens can propose initiatives that, if passed, become law in that state. In the past two decades, five farmed animal ballot initiatives have been passed in the US to improve animal welfare, namely through the banning of caged systems, setting higher welfare standards for both domestic production and imports. Two of these initiatives were in California. In this way, ballot initiatives provide an alternative mechanism to achieve policy change on broiler welfare, and set standards that can impact standards not only in internal but also external meat production, significantly reducing broiler suffering.&nbsp;</p><p>California appears to be the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rUloTYBOCuLYJyddzijUO52NcHApetgRJwO8lcRX0TU/edit#heading=h.sjuxaxndt157\"><u>most promising state</u></a> to run this in, given the recent successes in animal welfare ballot initiatives, the large scale of domestic production, status as a net importer of food and a liberal-voting populus. Our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rUloTYBOCuLYJyddzijUO52NcHApetgRJwO8lcRX0TU/edit#heading=h.dvqcz5lwaz2\"><u>cost effectiveness analysis</u></a> has shown that running this intervention in California could yield an improvement of ~31 welfare points per dollar spent, which places it as a moderately cost effective intervention. This is likely an underestimate of its true cost effectiveness, as passing this initiative could have wide-reaching secondary effects beyond the state of California, leading to a greater reduction of suffering. This may arise through initiating legislative change in states that export to California as was seen with the cage free ballot initiatives in the US, and increasing public awareness of animal welfare harms in meat production.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The largest concerns about this intervention regard the ability to raise sufficient funds to run this intervention. Our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rUloTYBOCuLYJyddzijUO52NcHApetgRJwO8lcRX0TU/edit#heading=h.dvqcz5lwaz2\"><u>cost effectiveness analysis</u></a> has estimated costs to range from&nbsp; $4.5 million to $15.5 million. Although funding organisations who may take an interest in providing grants for this exist, they may not be ready to fund a new organisation working on this. Therefore, should this intervention be implemented by a CE-incubated charity, the ideal co-founders would have experience running public-facing campaigns and a strong track record of success. However, this concern is reduced were this intervention executed by an existing organisation with a track record, funding and the appropriate resources and infrastructure, such as The Humane Society of the United States.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, my view is that running ballot initiatives to improve broiler welfare is an idea worth recommending to future charity founders or to an existing organisation. This work is moderately strong in terms of cost effectiveness and seems tractable. I am also very excited and quite optimistic about the impact that domestic actions in California could have on the progress for broiler welfare across other US states.</p><h1>1 &nbsp; &nbsp; Background</h1><h2>1.1 Broiler Welfare&nbsp;</h2><p>Broilers are chickens reared for meat. The majority of broilers are members of fast-growing breeds, which emerged from breeding programmes post the intensification of chicken farming in the late 1940s. These chickens grow up to 400% faster than their natural growth rates, reaching three times their pre-intensification rates in just over half the time&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thehumaneleague.org.uk/article/what-is-a-franken-chicken\"><u>(Whitnall, 2023)</u></a>. Typically, broilers are slaughtered at 5-6 weeks old, despite the lifespan of a backyard chicken falling between 5 and 12 years (<a href=\"https://thehumaneleague.org.uk/article/broiler-chickens?utm_source=thehumaneleagueuk&amp;utm_medium=blog\"><u>Bridgeman, 2021</u></a>). They are also subject to painful practices such as beak trimming and comb dubbing, and kept in overcrowded conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>However, beyond the welfare concerns that accompany intensive animal farming practices and conditions across species, the abnormally fast growth rates of these broiler breeds lead to a wide range of health issues, causing incredibly poor welfare in these chickens. These animals become too heavy for their skeletons, leading to lameness, as their musculoskeletal systems cannot keep up with their rapid rates of growth. Further, due to their excessive weight, members of the fast-growing breeds spend more time sedentary, leading them to develop painful lesions which can become infected as a result of the unhygienic environments on these farms. These broilers also suffer from failures of the cardiovascular system, leading many to die prematurely from sudden death syndrome (<a href=\"https://www.eurogroupforanimals.org/news/why-do-fast-growing-broiler-chicken-breeds-need-be-phased-out\"><u>Eurogroup for Animals, 2023</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><h2>1.2 Better Chicken Commitment and Corporate Campaigns</h2><p>Considerable work across Europe, North America, Oceania and South America has sought to address the main causes of broiler suffering, through the use of corporate campaigns. This involves outreach and pressure campaigns targeting major retailers that sell meat from chickens belonging to these fast-growing breeds, urging and inducing them to adopt a set of higher welfare standards for their products, formalised in the Better Chicken Commitment (BCC) outlined below (<a href=\"https://betterchickencommitment.com/us/policy/\"><u>Better Chicken Commitment, 2023</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><ol><li>By [deadline], maintain a<strong> maximum stocking density of 6.0 lbs./sq. foot</strong> and&nbsp;<strong>prohibit all forms of broiler cages.</strong></li><li>By [deadline], provide all birds with an improved baseline environment<a href=\"https://betterchickencommitment.com/us/policy/#fn1\"><sup><u>[1]</u></sup></a>, including:<ol><li>At least&nbsp;<strong>3 inches of friable litter</strong> covering the whole floor of the house, managed to maintain dry, friable condition and prevent caked or wet areas.</li><li>At minimum&nbsp;<strong>8 hours of continuous light</strong> (\u226550 lux) and&nbsp;<strong>6 hours of continuous darkness</strong> daily (&lt;1 lux).</li><li>One or more types of<strong> functional enrichment</strong> (such as perches, platforms, or straw bales) that multiple birds can use at any time. The enrichments must be available by 10 days old and maintained thereafter, dispersed throughout the house and available to the entire flock with 1 enrichment for every 1,000 sq. ft or 1 enrichment per 1000 birds, at a minimum.</li></ol></li><li>By [deadline], process chickens in a manner that&nbsp;<strong>avoids pre-stun handling</strong> and instead utilizes a<strong> multi-step controlled-atmosphere processing</strong> system that induces an&nbsp;<strong>irreversible stun.</strong></li><li>By [deadline], demonstrate compliance with all standards via&nbsp;<strong>third-party auditing&nbsp;</strong>and&nbsp;<strong>annual public reporting&nbsp;</strong>on progress toward this commitment.</li><li>By [deadline],&nbsp;<strong>use only BCC-approved breeds</strong> that demonstrate higher welfare outcomes.<strong>*</strong><ol><li>Breeds that have been approved for use to meet the BCC: JA757, JACY57, JA787, JA957, JA987, JACY87, or Norfolk Black; Rowan Ranger, Rambler Ranger, Ranger Classic, Ranger Premium, or Ranger Gold; REDBRO, RedbroM; Cobb-Sasso 200 (CS200), Cooks Venture Pioneer, or others that pass the breed welfare outcome assessments by either the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) or Global Animal Partnership (G.A.P.).</li></ol></li></ol><p>The Better Chicken Commitment demands improvements to broiler welfare that most significantly improve their welfare. In particular, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://welfarefootprint.org/\"><u>Welfare Footprint Project</u></a> identifies abnormally fast growth rates as the primary cause of pain in broilers, and concludes that switching from these breeds to slower growing breeds significantly reduces the suffering of these birds&nbsp;<a href=\"https://welfarefootprint.org/broilers\"><u>(Schuck-Paim and Alonso, 2022)</u></a>. Therefore, the adoption of the BCC is at lowest estimated to prevent \u201c33 [13 to 53] hours of Disabling pain, 79 [-99 to 260] hours of Hurtful and 25 [5 to 45] seconds of Excruciating pain for every bird affected by this intervention\u201d, considering only the hours the birds spend awake&nbsp;<a href=\"https://welfarefootprint.org/broilers\"><u>(Schuck-Paim and Alonso, 2022)</u></a>. This corresponds to a 66%, 24% and 78% reduction in the time experienced in Disabling, Hurtful and Excruciating pain respectively, relative to a conventional scenario due to issues such as lameness, cardiopulmonary disorders, behavioural deprivation and thermal stress experienced by these birds. Therefore, the BCC provides a standard for significantly improving the welfare of broilers through meaningful reductions in the worst forms of suffering they endure, driven by the adoption of slower growing breeds.</p><p>Across the world as of October 2023, 611 commitments have been secured by corporations to commit to these standards. However, of these, merely 11 have been reported as fulfilled and just 114 have been reported on by the corporations at all. (<a href=\"https://chickenwatch.org/progress-tracker/\"><u>Chickenwatch, 2023</u></a>). In the US, the deadline of the commitment is 3-7 years (<a href=\"https://betterchickencommitment.com/us/policy/\"><u>Better Chicken Commitment, 2023</u></a>). By 2022, 18% and 42% of companies who had made commitments had reported their progress in the US and EU respectively (<a href=\"https://www.compassioninfoodbusiness.com/our-work/key-tools-for-success/chickentrack/\"><u>CIWF, 2022</u></a>). Although corporate outreach has resulted in some great progress and tangible improvements in the welfare of broilers, the rate of progress has significantly slowed and there is doubt that corporations who have made commitments will follow through with the standards agreed upon. This suggests that another intervention strategy may be needed to effect these changes for broilers.</p><h2>1.3&nbsp; Ballot Initiatives</h2><p>Ballot initiatives in the United States are a form of direct democracy that allows citizens to propose and vote on laws or constitutional amendments at the state or local level. Unlike the traditional legislative process where laws are proposed and passed by elected officials, ballot initiatives allow citizens to directly participate in shaping public policy. Typically, once a ballot has been passed, it is legislatively binding (<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/intervention-profile-ballot-initiatives\"><u>Schukraft, 2020</u></a>). The typical procedure is as follows:</p><ol><li>Proposal:<ol><li>Citizens or advocacy groups draft a proposed law or constitutional amendment. This is often done in response to a perceived need or issue that has not been addressed by the legislature.</li></ol></li><li>Signature Gathering:<ol><li>In order to get the proposed initiative on the ballot, supporters must collect a certain number of signatures from registered voters. The number of required signatures varies by state and is usually a percentage of the total votes cast in the last election.</li></ol></li><li>Review and Certification:<ol><li>Election officials review the collected signatures to ensure they meet the requirements, including verifying that signatories are registered voters in the jurisdiction where the initiative is being proposed.</li></ol></li><li>Ballot Placement:<ol><li>If enough valid signatures are collected, the initiative is placed on the ballot for the next election. The ballot will include the full text of the proposed law or amendment, as well as an explanation for voters.</li></ol></li><li>Voting:<ol><li>On election day, voters decide whether to approve or reject the proposed initiative. If the initiative receives a majority of votes, it becomes law.</li></ol></li><li>Implementation:<ol><li>If the initiative passes, it is implemented as law. The government is then responsible for carrying out and enforcing the new measure.</li></ol></li></ol><p>In the US, several recent ballot initiatives have been run to improve animal welfare, particularly in establishing cage free laws in multiple states.

&nbsp; Theories of change</h1><h2>2.1 &nbsp; Scope of the intervention</h2><p>This intervention is focused upon the use of ballot initiatives to trigger legislative change that mandates the adoption of welfare standards for broilers that meet the BCC standards. This is limited to countries or states with direct democracies that are binding (<a href=\"https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/politics/how-four-countries-practise-direct-democracy-today/48308922\"><u>Kaufmann, 2023</u></a>). This is possible in a set of US states, Switzerland, Taiwan and Uruguay. Due to time constraints, this intervention focuses upon US states as in the US the most progress on broiler welfare has been made and this has the largest scale of chicken farming of these candidates (<a href=\"https://www.ciwf.com/food-business/chickentrack/\"><u>Chickentrack, 2022</u></a>), though implementation in Switzerland, Taiwan and Uruguay may be considered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>2.2 &nbsp; Causal chain</h2><p>The full Theory of Change (ToC) for ballot initiative to improve broiler welfare in the US, specific to the state of California (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rUloTYBOCuLYJyddzijUO52NcHApetgRJwO8lcRX0TU/edit#heading=h.j9lx2nmbkqat\"><u>Geographic Assessment</u></a>) can be found&nbsp;<a href=\"https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVNYsTB2o=/\"><u>here</u></a>. Figure 1 (below) is a simplified version of the full ToC, with major steps and uncertainties presented. Each box represents a step in the theory of change and the circles represent assumptions about that step that are taken. The most important assumptions are included in this figure. For all assumptions placed on the ToC, see the full version linked above. The colour in each circle represents the uncertainty about each assumption.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Figure 1: Causal Chain&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/s6kAqweGsbZeZFGRZ/kbir5fgqedcc49xbkwuz\"></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>2.3 &nbsp; Outlining assumptions and levels of uncertainty&nbsp;</h2><p>In this subsection, I will outline the assumptions identified in the ToC, and explain the level of uncertainty I have for them, based on my initial research and reasoning. The aim of this subsection is to help prioritise which assumptions are the most significant for this ToC to hold, and to identify the degree of uncertainty I have about them. In this way, one shouldn\u2019t take them as a final view.

This suggests that ballot initiatives are by no means guaranteed to be more cost effective than traditional advocacy, however determining this would require CEAs of both approaches within a region.&nbsp;</li><li>If ballot initiatives are less cost effective within a region than traditional policy advocacy, implementers can consult the ToC for this strategy, to continue the path to

improvement of broiler welfare, ensuring that there exists a set of standards which some parts of industry have already begun adopting.</li><li>Notably, some members of industry have found these

Although this will always remain speculative for a new campaign, this can be investigated using case studies of previous campaigns in the region of choice (California) and other US states. I will aim to investigate those and other factors in the next section.&nbsp;</p><h1>3&nbsp; &nbsp; Quality of evidence</h1><p>This section will evaluate the evidence that informs on the major uncertainties about this intervention.&nbsp;</p><h2>3.1 &nbsp; Evidence that a charity can make change in this space</h2><p>Evidence about whether a charity can make a change in this space is dependent upon assumptions 1-25. Although the most significant assumptions are 16, 19 and 25, the success of this intervention depends upon previous assumptions also holding. Therefore, I have selected the most important uncertainties to the success of this part of the ToC to investigate further through this evidence review. Further, these have been categorised to produce higher-level questions that highlight the overarching uncertainty relating to those assumptions.</p><p>Table 2 (below) states my initial certainty about each major question as well as my update to this certainty after having conducted my research into it. To increase my reasoning transparency, I have quantified my certainty as a percentage, and presented my updated in percentage points, to show how the evidence I encountered changed my mind overall. To avoid false precision in interpretation, I want to stress these values provide an indication of the magnitude and direction of my updates.&nbsp;</p><p>Table 2: Summary of major uncertainties about

find my research on each of these questions, with a conclusion and explanation of the impact of this evidence upon my certainty at the bottom (bolded).&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3.1.1 Can strong candidate regions be found for this intervention?</strong></h3><p>The first uncertainty here is whether there are regions where a ballot initiative could be held. In the US, 26 states allow direct democracy in the form of ballot initiatives, with 18 of these allowing constitutional ballots and 21 allowing statutory ballots (<a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Ballot_initiative\"><u>Ballotpedia, n.d</u></a>), validating the existence of a set of states to investigate as candidates, nullifying this uncertainty.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, it is important to identify whether these states would be promising to hold a ballot initiative. The geographical assessment evaluates these states through a geographical weighted factor model (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rUloTYBOCuLYJyddzijUO52NcHApetgRJwO8lcRX0TU/edit#heading=h.sjuxaxndt157\"><u>section 5</u></a>). From this analysis, multiple high priority states are identified, driven by a range of important factors. This demonstrates that there are a number of states which are promising candidates, which would all be the region of implementation following further analysis.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Evidence of multiple states with recent wins for farmed animal welfare through cage free campaigns reduces uncertainty here. Together, these increase my certainty in this assumption from<i>&nbsp;</i>60% to 85%, as there are a set of candidate states with the appropriate political mechanisms and strong track records, such that they are worthwhile regions to investigate for this intervention. This can be further explored through conducting cost effectiveness analysis of each of the top candidates (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rUloTYBOCuLYJyddzijUO52NcHApetgRJwO8lcRX0TU/edit#heading=h.dvqcz5lwaz2\"><u>see section 6</u></a>) from the geographical weighted factor model (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rUloTYBOCuLYJyddzijUO52NcHApetgRJwO8lcRX0TU/edit#heading=h.sjuxaxndt157\"><u>see section 7</u></a>).<br>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3.1.2 Can legal challenges from opposition be withstood?</strong></h3><p>Table 3: Summary of the previous legal challenges to farmed animal welfare ballots in the US, based on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Main_Page\"><u>Ballotpedia</u></a></p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top;width:90px\">Campaign</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);height:5px;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top;width:90px\">Challenge</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Description</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Outcome</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Lessons</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Update</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" rowspan=\"3\"><p>California Proposition 2, Farm Animal Confinement Initiative (2008)</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_2,_Farm_Animal_Confinement_Initiative_(2008)\"><u>(Ballotpedia, 2008)</u></a></p></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\" rowspan=\"3\">Missouri et al. v California</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Missouri, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Alabama, Kentucky, and Iowa filed a complaint against Assembly Bill 1437 (AB 1437) in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_District_Court_for_the_Eastern_District_of_California\"><u>U.S. District Court for Eastern California</u></a> on February 3, 2014.

Notably, the proponents of the initiative themselves cannot defend against these challenges, making it important that the initiatives are designed alongside lawyers and policy experts to ensure that they are compliant with the US constitution and other relevant laws, such that they can withstand the legal challenges posed, as the cage free ballots have done (see Table 3 above).&nbsp;</p><p>Although no legal challenges against cage free initiatives were meaningfully successful, there is weaker progress of corporate broiler welfare campaigns compared to cage free campaigns meaning a much smaller proportion (0.1% by my estimate -&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rUloTYBOCuLYJyddzijUO52NcHApetgRJwO8lcRX0TU/edit#heading=h.dvqcz5lwaz2\"><u>see Cost Effectiveness Analysis model</u></a>) of US chickens are currently compliant with the desired standards compared to when major recent cage free ballots were passed. Therefore, it is likely that the legal challenges posed against the cage free campaigns are more likely to be successful, given that there may be valid implementational concerns which affect a significant proportion of producers across states, not just a subset. However, well crafted initiatives may account for realistic implementation timelines and expectations to mitigate this. Further, leveraging the successes and experience of any producers and retailers which have already adopted higher welfare standards for broilers is critical. Finally, shaping the ask to be more realistic, such as focusing only on changing from faster to slower growing breeds as in Denmark, may increase implementational ability, reduce the extent of backlash and increase the chances of successfully defending such legal claims.&nbsp;</p><p><u>Ending Agricultural Trade Suppression Act</u></p><p>The EATS (Ending Agricultural Trade Suppression) Act is a proposed federal legislation that seeks to limit the power of individual states to set their own standards for agricultural products, a legal challenge to Prop 12 which has not yet seen its resolution. The EATS Act is designed to prevent states and local jurisdictions from regulating the production and distribution of agricultural products within their borders that are subject to interstate commerce (<a href=\"https://sentientmedia.org/eats-act-farm-bill/\"><u>Williams, 2023</u></a>). The primary goal of the Republican-led EATS Act is to end the authority of states and localities to set animal welfare and food safety standards\u200b\u200b. Some lawmakers are pushing for this to be included in the next Farm Bill, which was scheduled to be set by September 2023, although has not yet and is likely to be set in 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>The introduction of the EATS Act is a direct response to the success of various state-level animal welfare bills, notably California's Proposition 12. The EATS Act, if passed, would effectively invalidate laws like Proposition 12, undermining these state-level protections.</p><p><i>Historical precedents of EATS&nbsp;</i></p><p>The King amendment was an attempt by former Rep. Steve King to attach a provision to the 2014 and 2018 Farm Bills. This provision, officially known as the \u201cProtect Interstate Commerce Act\u201d (H.R. 4879), sought to block states from passing laws related to the sale of agricultural products within their own borders. It aimed to nullify hundreds of state and local laws pertaining to agricultural products, including laws to restrict farm animal confinement, ban the slaughter of horses, and crack down on puppy mills. The amendment was characterised as a radical federal overreach and an attack on states' rights and local decision-making authority\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b.</p><p>The King amendment generated overwhelming bipartisan opposition. It was ultimately defeated in the U.S. House of Representatives. This opposition included more than 200 organisations from across the political spectrum, as well as a bipartisan set of 119 Representatives led by Reps. Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.) and Earl Blumenauer (D-Ore.). The wide-ranging impact of the amendment on various domains, including food safety, environmental protection, promotion of local agriculture, and labour standards, contributed to its unpopularity and eventual defeat\u200b\u200b.</p><p>There is significant public demand for animal welfare, food safety, and public health standards. Recent polling found that 80% of U.S. voters favour laws within their state similar to California's Proposition 12, which includes roughly equal percentages of Republicans and Democrats. This indicates a strong, humane-minded American public that supports state-level standards for the treatment of animals, particularly in farming. States with laws prohibiting extreme confinement of animals span the political spectrum, including red, blue, and purple states\u200b\u200b.</p><p>The failure of the King amendment, due to recent bipartisan opposition and public sentiment favouring state-level animal welfare standards, suggests a challenging path for the EATS Act. The act's similarity to the King amendment and its potential to undermine popular state laws could lead to similar opposition. However, it's important to consider the changing political landscape and the specific context in which the EATS Act is being introduced, as these factors could influence its chances of passing. Given this, the likelihood of the EATS Act passing seems low-moderate, but this is still high enough to have some concern and pay attention to how this develops. However, since the EATS Act passing would significantly change the landscape with regards to political advocacy for animals in the US such that the majority of interventions would need to be reconsidered in some way, I have chosen not to evaluate this intervention with a future where EATS has passed in mind.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>I update slightly upwards, from 50% to 55%, about the likelihood of defending against legal challenges, as based on relevant case studies (Table 3)&nbsp; it seems very possible that with appropriate prior legal consultation, the outcomes of ballot initiatives will not be overturned, even with strong opposition. However, this remains a significant uncertainty.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, the yet unresolved EATS act which has been proposed in opposition to Prop 12 may significantly undermine the previously won ballot initiatives. The main historical precedents of the EATS act, namely the King amendment, was met with widespread, bipartisan opposition and considered to be a federal overreach. Although this sets a low expectation that EATS is approved at baseline, the more unpredictable and polarised contemporary political landscape causes an update towards a slightly higher likelihood of passing. This would undermine the welfare benefits of previous ballot initiatives and make new ones redundant, however would also completely change the landscape for political advocacy for animals in the US, and as such would impact the majority of policy-focused animal welfare interventions. Therefore, the progress of this proposed legislation should be monitored, and this intervention should be reconsidered should it pass.</p><h3><strong>3.1.3 Can enough signatures be collected to make it to the election?</strong></h3><p>This is a highly important uncertainty, as this is a breaking point in the causal chain. There have been 86 ballot initiatives proposed regarding the treatment of animals, with 49 making it to ballot, and 37 not. However, not all 37 did not make it to ballot due to not enough signatures, as some were removed due to other reasons such as sufficient counter-proposals from the government&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Treatment_of_animals_on_the_ballot#By_state\"><u>(Ballotpedia, 2023)</u></a>. This gives a baseline success rate of 57% for animal-related petitions to gain enough signatures to make it to election. However, 100% of farmed animal initiatives have gained enough signatures to make it to the election, including 2 measures in the last 8 years, causing me to update my certainty about this by 25% to 72%.&nbsp;</p><p>Different states require a different number of signatures at this point in a statutory initiative, ranging from around 15,500 to 550,000 (<a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Initiated_constitutional_amendment\"><u>Ballotpedia, 2023</u></a>). Signatures can be collected through running a physical signature collection campaign, hiring petition drive agencies to help collect signatures, or some combination of the two.&nbsp;</p><p>The Swiss anti-factory farming initiative built and deployed a network of volunteers to collect signatures across the country, resulting in very low cost per signature that came only from the staff costs associated with overseeing volunteers. However, this highlights the importance of building a strong&nbsp; network of volunteers as a mechanism of collecting signatures. Although it may be challenging to build this from scratch, the ToC specifies creating a coalition of all interested groups, including pre-existing animal welfare organisations with strong volunteer bases such as the Humane Society of the US or The Humane League. Further, state-level organisations can be approached for collaboration, giving access to on the ground volunteers. This increases my confidence by 7.5%, as it demonstrates a viable low cost path for collecting the required signatures. Despite it entailing a sufficient volunteer network, the existence of organisations who have this who are likely to want to collaborate limits the extent that this challenge reduces the scale of the update.&nbsp;</p><p>The following organisations endorsed Proposition 12:</p><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humane_Society_of_the_United_States\"><u>Humane Society of the United States</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Society_for_the_Prevention_of_Cruelty_to_Animals\"><u>ASPCA (American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals)</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercy_for_Animals\"><u>Mercy for Animals</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Humane_League\"><u>The Humane League</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassion_in_World_Farming\"><u>Compassion in World Farming</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Legal_Defense_Fund\"><u>Animal Legal Defense Fund</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://animalequality.org.uk/\"><u>Animal Equality</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Protection_and_Rescue_League\"><u>Animal Protection and Rescue League (APRL)</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compassion_Over_Killing\"><u>Compassion Over Killing</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In_Defense_of_Animals\"><u>In Defense of Animals (IDA)</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco_SPCA\"><u>San Francisco SPCA</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Diego_Humane_Society\"><u>San Diego Humane Society</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Marin_Humane_Society&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\"><u>Marin Humane Society</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Food_Safety\"><u>Center for Food Safety</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_Consumers_Association\"><u>Organic Consumers Association</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_for_Biological_Diversity\"><u>Center for Biological Diversity</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sierra_Club\"><u>Sierra Club California</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Farm_Workers\"><u>United Farm Workers</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Farm_Sanctuary\"><u>Farm Sanctuary</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Animal_Protection\"><u>World Animal Protection</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Welfare_Institute\"><u>Animal Welfare Institute</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=California_Animal_Welfare_Association&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1\"><u>California Animal Welfare Association</u></a>.</p><p>This demonstrates the scale of the potential collaboration that could occur in this proposal to provide resources to reach the signature requirement.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Ballot_measures_cost_per_required_signatures_analysis\"><u>Ballotpedia</u></a> reports that the cost-per-signature varies from $0.79 at lowest to $16.28 across the ballot initiatives held in 2023. This would lead to an estimated cost of $12,309.78 to $8,899,478.28 to achieve the required number of signatures. However, a factor to select states for intervention may be the required number of signatures, so the expected cost would be much closer to the lower bound, and as such be an affordable cost. Indeed, recent ballot initiatives for farmed animal welfare in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Massachusetts_Minimum_Size_Requirements_for_Farm_Animal_Containment,_Question_3_(2016)\"><u>Massachusetts</u></a> (2016) and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_12,_Farm_Animal_Confinement_Initiative_(2018)\"><u>California</u></a> (2018) cost $1.35 and $6.01 per required signature respectively, and each of the recent ballot initiatives for farmed animal welfare in the US collected a surplus of signatures. Furthermore, sponsors of the initiative in California hired petition drive companies (AAP Holding Company, Inc. and The Monaco Group) to collect signatures for the petition to qualify this measure for the ballot (<a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_12,_Farm_Animal_Confinement_Initiative_(2018)\"><u>Ballotpedia, 2023</u></a>). This demonstrates that collecting enough (and indeed surplus) signatures is a realistic expectation. Further, even at a large scale such as with California collecting 664,969 signatures despite needing 365,880 valid signatures, financial resources can be used to reach this number with ease. This increases my confidence by 15%, as it provides recent evidence of multiple initiatives successfully raising a surplus of signatures at both a low and high scale.&nbsp;</p><p>There are administrative requirements that may make this more challenging. For example, in Massachusetts, signatures must be collected between the first Wednesday of September and 14 days before the first Wednesday in December, providing a short window to carry this out. Further, this forces collection to be over autumn/winter, where weather conditions may make it more difficult to reach the number. However, this is not taken as strong negative evidence, as Massachusetts has twice seen farmed animal welfare ballots meet the required number, including most recently in 2016. Therefore, this only reduces confidence by 5%.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Overall, this significantly reduces my uncertainty about whether sufficient signatures could be collected, with repeated evidence of its completion specifically in the context of farmed animal welfare, in a range of states of different sizes and geographics in the US (Massachusetts, California, Arizona, Florida). Further, tactics such as building a volunteer network, leveraging the volunteer network of other organisations and hiring petition drive agencies provide ways to increase the likelihood of this being a successful step in the intervention. This takes my confidence from 57% to 90%.</p><h3><strong>3.1.4 Can enough votes be won to win the election?</strong></h3><p>Since 2000, 813 ballot initiatives have been held, with a baseline success rate of 47%&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Initiative_frequency_and_success_throughout_the_decades\"><u>(Ballotpedia, 2023)</u></a>. In US history, 49 initiatives regarding animals have made it to ballot, and of these 25 have won. This presents a similar success rate of 51%. Since 2000, 22 initiatives regarding animals have made it to ballot, and of these 14 have won, giving a success rate of 64%. Further, of the 5 ballots which have been held for farmed animal welfare in the US since 2000, there has been a 100% success rate. This provides compelling evidence to update the likelihood of winning the election upwards.&nbsp;</p><p>6 ballot initiatives for farmed animal welfare have been recorded in the US, and 5 of these have been successful. 1 ballot initiative to ban factory farming has been run in Switzerland, and this was unsuccessful, however was not run in the expectation of winning but to shift the Overton window and bring this position into the mainstream.</p><p>Table 4: Summary of Historical Farmed Animal Ballot Initiatives in the US and Switzerland</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td

78% in Massachusetts and have also influenced the adoption of legislation to phase out cages for hens in other states (<a href=\"https://cagefreelaws.com/\"><u>CageFreeLaws, 2023</u></a>). This suggests there may be a ripe political environment to pursue improvements to animal welfare within these states.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, the failed ballot was held 35 years ago and a more recent ballot in the same state has since been passed. Further, Swiss Factory Farming Initiative failed (<a href=\"https://www.bk.admin.ch/ch/d/pore/va/20220925/can658.html\"><u>BK, 2022</u></a>), however this was a much more ambitious proposal calling for the phasing out of industrial farming.

However, the rate of fulfilment was significantly higher at this stage of the cage free movement than current broiler commitments. Therefore, although this suggests that an extensive market coverage of corporate commitments is a necessary prerequisite for success in ballot initiatives, the lower rate of fulfilment of broiler commitments may pose an obstacle for ballot initiatives for broilers as it may be taken as evidence by voters that these welfare standards are unpopular and unrealistic. According to expert views, a significant reason for the low adoption rates of the full BCC welfare standards is that it is very expensive and challenging for producers to implement this. However, future trends may see producers partially meet the BCC requirements, with a focus upon transitioning the breeds from faster-growing to slower-growing breeds. Indeed, the Danish government has committed to phase out state procurement of fast-growing chickens (<a href=\"https://www.eurogroupforanimals.org/news/huge-win-denmark-agrees-phase-out-fast-growing-broiler-chickens\"><u>Eurogroup for Animals, 2023</u></a>), demonstrating a new-found progress with improving broiler welfare through reconsidering the extent of the ask.&nbsp;</p><p>It is also important to consider the novelty of the ask. Cage free campaigns have existed for much longer and are more comprehensible and morally intuitive to voters.&nbsp; However, although cage free campaigns may be slightly more salient from the perspective of the voter, I believe that the approach of campaigning for the end of Frankenchickens can be framed to be made a sufficiently evocative ask. Nonetheless, some uncertainty remains about how this would be perceived.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>On the whole, I conclude that cage free ballots can provide a moderately strong example for broiler ballots. Additionally, the high success rates of general animal treatment ballots compared to baseline beyond just cage free campaigns provides robust evidence that the probability of success for a broiler initiative may be increased beyond baseline.&nbsp;</p><p>Overall, I hold a high certainty that it is possible to win an election for a measure about animal welfare. However, this depends upon strategic campaigning, funding, the campaign of the opposition and other contextual factors that may be unforeseen and influence the outcome.&nbsp;</p><p>The baseline certainty that an election could be won is 51%, as this is the success rate of all ballots since 2000 in the US. I updated +13pp as all animal-specific ballots since 2000 have a success rate of 64%. I further updated +25pp to 89% as all farmed animal-specific ballots since 2000 have won, including twice in California, one of the highest priority states for this intervention (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rUloTYBOCuLYJyddzijUO52NcHApetgRJwO8lcRX0TU/edit#heading=h.sjuxaxndt157\"><u>Geographical Assessment</u></a>). Notably, I do not update all the way to 100% despite the 100% success rate in farmed animal ballots since 2000 in the US, as is it not completely certain that the next farmed animal welfare ballot would win despite a winning record in recent years. I update -15pp as it is generally hard to win a majority vote. I update a further -8pp due to the challenges being faced by current broiler campaigns and uncertainty around the success rate of a novel ask. Therefore, the total evidence causes me to update +15pp to 66% confidence.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>3.1.5 Will the proposed changes be appropriately implemented?</strong></h3><p>The biggest factor that seems to determine are the wording and enforcement measures included in the original initiative. Indeed, California Prop 2 was intended to phase out cages, however industry adopted enriched cages instead, finding a loophole that they would use to circumvent the intentions of the initiative. It seems critical therefore, that initiatives are designed with consultation from legal, policy and industry experts, to ensure that the requirements and enforcement mechanisms do not allow for this. Indeed, in the case of broilers, with the major welfare improvements coming from switching from faster to slower growing breeds, it seems important to specify the breeds which can and cannot be raised, as well as outlawing the generation of new breeds that grow beyond threshold speeds and beyond threshold weights.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, remaining active during the implementation phase to ensure that rulings are followed and to put pressure on producers that are slow to adopt new standards.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/4rtnBHaxHYsEofWH3/do-countries-comply-with-eu-animal-welfare-laws\"><u>Dullaghan (2020)</u></a> reports that compliance with animal welfare laws is not automatic and often requires enforcement actions, with non-compliance with broiler density standards in the EU at 21%-66%, giving a range of compliance from 34% to 79%. I expect compliance rates to be slightly lower in the US. However, in the initiative specifications, enforcement mechanisms and penalties can be clearly stated such that it increases the rates of enforcement.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Overall, I update weakly upwards on this assumption, as although Prop 2 in California was circumvented, it seems clearer that in the case of broiler welfare, such efforts can be prevented through the initiative design. Further, groups like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.legalimpactforchickens.org/\"><u>Legal Impact for Chickens</u></a> may be able to aid in enforcement to ensure implementation, alongside the enforcement activities driven by the charity. My baseline certainty was 50%, and this is raised to 55%, given that the average enforcement of broiler density standards in the EU was 56.5% and well crafted legislation and targeted enforcement efforts would increase the probability of this. With further research into enforcement strategies, I estimate that this certainty would increase more.&nbsp;</p><h2>3.2&nbsp; Evidence that the change has the expected effects</h2><p>Research by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://welfarefootprint.org/broilers\"><u>Schuck-Paim and Alonso (2022)</u></a> claims that adoption of BCC standards and slower-growing broiler strains have a net positive effect on the welfare of broiler chickens, with a reduction of 33 [13 to 53] hours of Disabling, (66% reduction), 79 [-99 to 260] hours of Hurtful (24% reduction) and 25 [5 to 45] seconds of Excruciating pain (78% reduction). With this, we are very confident that the changes to welfare as a result of adoption of the BCC significantly improve broiler welfare.&nbsp;</p><p>In the UK, the BCC is expected to increase chicken costs by 15% (<a href=\"https://www.thegrocer.co.uk/meat/why-are-supermarkets-ignoring-the-better-chicken-commitment/681388.article#:~:text=Pricing%20and%20production&amp;text=It%20costs%20around%2015%25%20more,are%20reflected%20in%20retail%20prices.\"><u>The Grocer, 2023</u></a>) 30% (<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/apr/16/cheaper-than-chips-frankenchicken-at-the-centre-of-fight-for-animal-welfare\"><u>Guardian News and Media, 2022</u></a>), however this is unlikely to have significant effects upon the consumption of chicken, as in the US chicken consumption is considered to be inelastic&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ag.purdue.edu/cfdas/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/CA1378_061523_Price-Impact-of-Meat-Alternatives-on-Meat-Demand_USDAApproved_logo-added-2.pdf\"><u>(Tonsor and Bina, 2023)</u></a>. However, even if mild increases in prices reduced consumption of chicken, this is likely to be replaced with pork or beef consumption, which are larger animals and as such does not increase suffering through the small animal replacement problem.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, fish is also a substitutable good for chicken, therefore were chicken demand to mildly decrease with respect to price, fish demand would be expected to increase. The average weight of a broiler at slaughter is about 1.8kg (<a href=\"https://animal-welfare.extension.org/how-long-does-it-take-for-broiler-chickens-to-be-ready-for-the-market/#:~:text=Broilers%20chickens%20are%20specially%20bred,ten%20pounds%2C%20are%20called%20roasters.\"><u>Animal-Welfare, 2019</u></a>). The mean live weight of a farmed shrimp in the US was 15.8g in 2018 (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Fhoq7tP9LYPqaJDxx/shrimp-the-animals-most-commonly-used-and-killed-for-food\"><u>Waldhorn and Autric, 2023</u></a>). The mean weight of a salmon at slaughter is 9.1kg&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.pacific-salmon.com/products/salmon/#:~:text=Adult%20fish%20range%20in%20size%20from%2022%20to%2032%20inches,20%20pounds%20(9.1%20kg).\"><u>(Pacific Salmon Industries Incorporated, 2023)</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Based on this, the number of shrimp that would be needed to be consumed to replace 1 chicken would be ~113. However, the price of chicken is considered to be inelastic, and it is unlikely the entire substitution of chicken would be with shrimp, or indeed fish, with this likely distributed over many meat products. If chicken consumption fell by 30%, and 25% of this was replaced by fish consumption, and 80% of this was shrimp consumption, 1.8kg of chicken would be replaced by 108g of shrimp which is roughly equal to 7 farmed shrimp. The welfare range of shrimp is 0.031, whereas for chicken it is 0.332 (Fischer, 2023), suggesting that shrimp have 10% the capacity of pain of fish.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Therefore, although this slightly increases my uncertainty in this assumption, I am overall highly certain that the change will have the expected effects of improving animal welfare significantly and that substitution effects will not cause this intervention to cause a net reduction in animal suffering.&nbsp;</p><h2>3.3&nbsp; Conclusion of Evidence Review</h2><p>Overall, I update positively on all major assumptions from this evidence review into the most significant uncertainties. It is important to note that this is because it seems very possible to make the appropriate strategic decisions to prevent breakdowns in the ToC due to issues such as legal challenges and implementation challenges, as well as trends showing that farmed animal (and general animal) initiatives appear to have higher success rates in the US compared to baseline.&nbsp;</p><h1>4 &nbsp; &nbsp; Expert views</h1><p>This section summarises the main points of discussion in interviews conducted with experts on ballot initiatives or broiler welfare campaigns.</p><h2>4.1 Silvano Lieger - Co-Managing Director,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sentience.ch/en/\"><u>Sentience</u></a> (Switzerland)</h2><p>Silvano Lieger was co-managing director of the animal advocacy organisation Sentience in Switzerland, which ran a ballot initiative to end factory farming. The initiative was voted on in 2022, in which it was unsuccessful, gaining 37% of the vote. However, Silvano reports that the primary aim of their initiative was to shift the Overton window and to make ending factory farming a viable political position to hold. This interview with Silvano focused on gaining insights about the upshots and challenges of running a ballot initiative for farmed animal welfare, and to increase the likelihood of success for this intervention type.</p><p>Preparation and Collaboration</p><p>Silvano emphasised one of the main things they would do differently would be to build an alliance before the initiative has been written, and to involve as many groups as possible who may have an interest in this. Silvano referred to the building of a shared vision, having co-ownership of the proposed legislation, which should be crafted with legal and policy experts and key stakeholders, such as producers and retailers. In particular, farmers who already have a higher welfare standard than the market may be approached for inclusion in such a coalition, through representatives of local farming organisations. This is critical to accessing a large base of volunteers, funding, arguments, expertise and forming key relationships that can change the outcome of the intervention.&nbsp;</p><p>Silvano recommended identifying who the likely opposition are to be, and to determine if there would be any way in which they would not fight this, for example through considering ESG goals, concern for human welfare, damage to their reputation or campaign costs- if so, explore this strategy. Silvano also recommended interviewing producers to understand how this intervention would affect them.&nbsp;</p><p>Collecting Signatures</p><p>Silvano explained that Sentience collected their required signatures (around 100,000) through the work volunteers, incurring very low costs for this part of the intervention. They build teams of volunteers across different regions, with leaders in each group coordinating their local volunteers, overseen by two FTEs. Silvano mentioned that there was also the option to use petition drive agencies, which cost roughly 4 francs per signature, but that this was not needed. Silvano emphasised the importance of selecting an appropriate season to carry this out, as physical signatures are harder to collect in the colder months where people are indoors. For this stage of the campaign, no opposition efforts were seen, nor was there found to be much need to carry out media campaigns, as opposition tends to form once the required signatures have been reached and the initiative is confirmed to be voted upon. However, volunteers were trained and arguments for signing this petition were agreed upon and disseminated. It is important to note that Silvano attributed the lack of requirement for auxiliary campaigns at this stage due to the Swiss public being very accustomed to signing ballot petitions. In another context, this may not be the same (although US states with direct democracies are likely to see similar trends).&nbsp;</p><p>Pre-election campaign</p><p>Silvano stated that this stage involved hiring a suitable team, preparing key resources and argument testing through polling. Silvano estimated that one nationally representative poll would cost 30,000 francs, and Sentience carried out two over the course of the campaign.</p><p>Campaign</p><p>Sentience adopted a range of strategies including leafleting, door-to-door campaigning, sending information to houses, gaining celebrity endorsements, media appearance when possible, curating a mailing list and sharing arguments and updates with them, having strong partners who could use their own mailing lists and supporter base, creating video advertisements and running physical advertisements (billboards).&nbsp;</p><p>Team</p><p>By the final stage, 8 FTEs (full time employees) with 2 FTEs working exclusively with volunteers. 1400 volunteers by the final stage.&nbsp;</p><p>Costs</p><p>The total cost was around 2 million francs, most of which was allocated to salaries and advertisements. Silvano noted that collaboration with other organisations can reduce costs such as software, equipment and physical spaces.&nbsp;</p><p>Limiting factors</p><p>Silvano did not think that receiving 500,000 more francs would make a big difference. There is a strong status quo bias in the Swiss population, resulting in a resistance to such a large change. However, he estimated that without any farmer support, they would have had at least 10% less of the vote.</p><p>Main updates</p><ul><li>Creating a strong, broad coalition with all relevant interest groups who have shared ownership into the initiative is very important&nbsp;<ul><li>Including farmers is critical&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>Volunteer networks are important for carrying out campaign work at low costs</li><li>Coalitions are very useful for pooling resources including expertise, software, funding, supporter bases and can legitimise the campaign</li></ul><h2>4.2 Jonas Becker - Campaigner at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://albertschweitzerfoundation.org/\"><u>Albert Schweitzer Foundation</u></a> (Germany)</h2><p>Jonas Becker is an expert in the state of cage free and broiler corporate campaigns in the EU, and provided insight into how ballot initiatives could play into the current advocacy landscape. Jonas highlighted that there are concerns over the tractability of current broiler welfare commitments, with the rate of new uptakes and rate of fulfilment of commitments slowing down across the EU. This is also broadly seen in the US. Jonas presented the personal view that policy work for broiler welfare is a method that is underutilised, and that ballot initiatives could be used in a complimentary way to existing corporate campaigns. Although he sees this as promising, he holds no strong views as the context of the US is different to Europe.</p><p>Main updates</p><ul><li>Ballot initiatives could pose a promising angle to create progress for broiler welfare where corporate efforts seem to be stalling</li></ul><h2>4.3 David Michelson - Chief Petitioner at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.yesonip3.org/\"><u>Yes on IP3</u></a> (Oregon, US)</h2><p>David Michelson is an activist &amp; chief petitioner of the Yes On IP13 ballot initiative campaign which seeks to outlaw the harming &amp; killing of sentient animals in Oregon, US, without exceptions for animal agriculture, hunting or research. Although this campaign initially sought to qualify for the 2024 election, they were not on track to do this, so have postponed to preserve their remaining funds with the aim to qualify for the 2026 election.&nbsp;</p><p>Aim</p><p>The primary aim of the initiative is to qualify for the ballot and cause the public to engage with animal rights as a political issue.&nbsp;</p><p>Organisational Structure</p><p>The Yes on IP3 campaign was small, having 3 main leaders of the campaign, none of whom were salaried, but with David taking on the bulk of the responsibility. They also established a small volunteer network, and employed paid petitioners. They had limited collaborations, as most organisations found this too radical a position to hold.&nbsp;</p><p>Although they sought to pay petitioners to collect signatures, and made contracts for many individuals, 3 paid petitioners and 2 volunteers collected most of the signatures, with the best paid petitioners working at 20 to 30 hours per week. In July 2023, 3,500 signatures came from volunteers and 7,000 signatures came from paid petitioners. In this month, 16.4 signatures were collected per hour per person and the cost was $1.72 per signature. Over the collection period, the rate of signature collection was 2,000 per week, which would not be high enough to qualify for 2024 but could allow them to qualify for 2026, if they start at the beginning of the collection period in the summer of 2024. Notably, the cost of signatures in the Prop 12 campaign in California was significantly higher, at $6.01 discounting invalid signatures. David noted that petitioners get paid a lot more in California due to higher cost of living, but also that their organisational structure meant there was no overhead bar petitioner fees, bringing down the cost significantly.&nbsp;</p><p>Funding</p><p>The campaign received $50,000 from an individual donor, $50,000 from an organisation, and $10,000 from small donors and noted a difficulty in winning funding for this, which limits their scope. They noted having been unsuccessful for the EA Animal Welfare Fund and the ACE Movement Grant.&nbsp;</p><p>Limiting Factors</p><p>David noticed a struggle in finding a sufficient number of committed volunteers or paid petitioners to collect signatures. There was an extremely high turnover rate in petitioning as a result, and this limited the number of signatures that could be collected.&nbsp;</p><p>The limited funding meant that they could not pay themselves and as such the campaign was run by a small number of volunteers, making it harder for individuals to commit time.&nbsp;</p><p>Main updates</p><ul><li>A strong volunteer base is critical to gain signatures<ul><li>Paid petitioners are not extremely reliable</li></ul></li><li>The cost per signature can be lower than modelled in my CEA&nbsp;</li></ul><h1>5 &nbsp; &nbsp; Geographic assessment</h1><p>The spreadsheet containing the weighted factor model can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wJsjpviuE9BhgnsqeI8hmOY1LaYpy-UTCCPT9pAtdn4/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>#RTP23A9 - Ballot Initatives to Improve Broiler Welfare - Geographical Assessment</u></a></p><h2>5.1 Geographic assessment</h2><p>This geographic assessment was conducted by constructing a weighted factor model, to rank candidate US states (states with ballot initiatives that can affect state constitutions), based on their estimated suitability as a region for this intervention to be conducted in.&nbsp;</p><p>Given that this intervention strategy requires favourable public opinion upon improving animal welfare, criteria which reflected scale and tractability were chosen, as neglected regions are not well suited to this strategy. There may be a worry of crowding out, if there are too many animal-related ballots running in the same state, tiring voters and diluting/confusing messages. Currently, only Colorado has an animal-related ballot set for the upcoming election in 2024 (<a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Colorado_Define_and_Prohibit_Trophy_Hunting_Initiative_(2024)\"><u>Ballotpedia, 2023a</u></a>). Further, campaigners in Oregon are planning to re-launch their campaign to ban animal abuse for the 2024-2026 cycle, so if successful this could also end up on the ballot in 2026 (<a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Oregon_Prohibit_the_Injury_or_Killing_of_Animals_Initiative_(2024)\"><u>Ballotpedia, 2023b</u></a>).

Although the scale of broiler farming is an important indicator of the size of impact, states where the scale is particularly high are likely to be heavily dependent upon and invested in animal agriculture, and as such there would likely be a greater opposition to an initiative of this kind, decreasing the likelihood of successfully passing the ballot.&nbsp;</p><p>The highest priority states (in order) were:</p><ol><li>Massachusetts</li><li>California</li><li>Oregon</li><li>Colorado&nbsp;</li><li>Nevada&nbsp;</li></ol><p>The model produced rankings which roughly matched initial expectations, with an extremely strong correlation (r=0.98) between the liberalness of the state and the final score. Given that the success of these initiatives are largely dependent upon the willingness of the populus to support a proposal to improve animal welfare, this makes sense. Further, low-moderate scale broiler production, strong existing animal welfare laws, including cage free legislation, make these states well fit as regions for this intervention. There were no significant surprises in the rankings, although Florida, which received a relatively low rank, has a track record of farm animal ballots with the first successful farm animal ballot in the US passed in Florida in 2002. Additionally, Florida has strong animal welfare laws including cage free legislation. Florida requires a higher number of signatures and proportion of the final vote than the rest of the states, which may drive its final score down. Although it could be argued Florida should be higher, the increased practical challenge of gaining a higher number of signatures, and the low liberalness of the populus make it less certain that such a campaign could be successful in this state.&nbsp;</p><h1>6 &nbsp; Cost-effectiveness analysis</h1><p>The cost effectiveness analysis can be found here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Ir-M2v_sn1uO4pIhJVtueOsIDbgEO7XLGZImWnf87xY/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>#RTP23A9 - Ballot Initatives to Improve Broiler Welfare - Cost Effectiveness Analysis</u></a></p><p>This Cost Effective Analysis models the expected improvement in welfare points per $ for running this intervention, compared to the counterfactual.

One may also consider the effect in terms of the number of animals affected per dollar.&nbsp;</p><p>The cost effectiveness for this intervention is 31.35 WP per $, with 58.22 chickens affected per $.

Therefore, given that the second state California was only marginally ranked lower and has a higher number of chickens farmed by several orders of magnitude, I investigated this as the state of intervention for this report.</p><p>The number of broiler chickens produced in the state of choice (California) per year was calculated by estimating the yearly rate of growth of US broiler production from projections of US poultry production until 2050. Further, the reduction in broilers suffering from successes of current US broiler welfare corporate work has been modelled. The replacement effect of switching from faster growing breeds which grow larger than the slower growing breeds was modelled, as this will likely result in an increased number of chickens farmed to meet the same production levels.</p><p>I have assumed that 2.4 slower growing chickens would be raised to replace every faster growing chicken, as the slaughter weight of a faster growing chickens 2.4 times pre industrialisation. However, in actuality, the replacement factor may be lower, which would increase the WP/$.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to time constraints, certain assumptions were made, however I expect that they would not significantly change the outcome. The proportion of broilers in factory farms, and of those the proportion who belong to fast growing breeds, were also assumed to keep constant over this time period. The CEA spreadsheet can be edited with relative ease to incorporate these considerations in future work.&nbsp;</p><h2>6.1 &nbsp; Effects</h2><p>The impact was calculated by determining the improvement in welfare points per year from carrying out this intervention, compared to the counterfactual model. This involved estimating the number of years taken to pass the ballot, number of years taken to transition, and estimating the final proportion of chickens that would belong to fast growing breeds were the policy to be implemented (a small percentage due to minor enforcement challenges). Using these values, I modelled the proportion of factory farmed broilers that would belong to fast growing breeds, from the baseline at the year of passing the intervention to the estimated final proportion. I assumed that no non-factory farmed broilers are from fast growing breeds, so the final benefit may be slightly underestimated. I then calculated the number of chickens that would belong to each type of breed and multiplied this by the welfare points estimated to represent that condition. These points were then discounted for probability of sentience and welfare range. Further, these points were discounted for the probability of success, taken as the product of success at each point in the process (obtain required number of signatures, win the ballot).&nbsp;</p><p>I was able to model the counterfactual adoption of these higher welfare broiler standards (including the use of slower growing breeds) due to corporate outreach, which is the primary mechanism currently being used for this issue, and so discounted this from the impact, to determine what number of chickens that are transitioned to higher welfare will be because of this intervention.</p><p>I also discounted for regulatory enforcement, by using this to set the upper bound of impact. For example, regulatory approval was estimated to be 85% at upper bound, so this means 15% of the 94.05% of factory farmed broilers belonging to fast growing breeds that would be supposed to be transitioned would not be. I also discounted the benefits based on possible improvement to animal welfare due to moral progress.</p><p>I modelled the effects over 20 years, as this is the estimate for how many years this intervention may speed up the implementation of such a policy, then calculated the average benefit per year and scaled this to 10 years to allow for comparison to other interventions.&nbsp;</p><h2>6.2 &nbsp; Costs</h2><p>The costs were calculated by breaking down the intervention into time bound phases, based on the temporal requirements of ballots in California. I then modelled the upper and lower bound estimated for all relevant factors in each phase, such as wages, legal services, polling and on various forms of advertisement at appropriate levels to win an election in California.

Further, I think it is critical that co-founders and initial employees have strong relationships within and contextual knowledge of the state of California, as they will need to generate a statewide campaign to win a simple majority in the next statewide election.&nbsp;</p><p>However, given the strong network at CE and the existing previous collaborative work between animal welfare organisations in California, I expect that these relationships and this contextual knowledge can be gained by new founders. Further, the incubation program should appropriately train founders in fundraising, volunteer management, marketing, campaign management and stakeholder engagement.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, I think that the ideal co-founders would have some experience running public facing campaigns, some experience with fundraising and should be willing to relocate to California for the duration of this intervention. Further, they should have a track record of success within similar areas, as this may be particularly important to funders.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Access</strong></h3><p><strong>Information</strong></p><p>Most recent data on the number of broilers produced by some individual states are withheld or grouped with other states, however there is data from 2017 that appears sufficient. There is ample information available about broiler welfare, ballot initiatives and the Better Chicken Commitment, such that I do not anticipate this being a problem.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Relevant stakeholders</strong></p><p>One type of relevant stakeholder are organisations which already work on broiler campaigns or which would be approached to collaborate on a ballot initiative, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.humanesociety.org/\"><u>The Humane Society of the US</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thehumaneleague.org/\"><u>The Humane League US</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mercyforanimals.org/\"><u>Mercy for Animals</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ciwf.eu/about-us/\"><u>Compassion in World Farming</u></a>. I expect this to be accessible, particularly given their involvement in recent ballot initiatives in California for cage free laws in 2008 and 2018 and/or corporate broiler campaigns. Another type of stakeholder would be members of the agriculture industry. I expect this to be easy to access, given high welfare producers would likely support this initiative. Finally, policymakers and legal experts would be accessible, given recent ballot initiatives in California having required relationships with such individuals to have been built.</p><h3><strong>Feedback loops</strong></h3><p>Signature collection can be tracked to determine whether outreach methods are effective and whether the charity will be on track to meet their required number in the required time. Public opinion can be measured through polls. However, this is a one-shot intervention, with the main feedback coming from the final vote at election, by which point no updates can be made to the intervention. This makes it important to test messaging and organisational strategies early and leverage any expertise available.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Funding</strong></h3><p>I estimate this organisation to need $4.5 million to $15.5 million.&nbsp;</p><p>The campaign behind Prop 12 in California in 2018 was reported to have raised $13.3 million and was estimated to have cost $15.90 million \u00b1 $1.4 (<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rUloTYBOCuLYJyddzijUO52NcHApetgRJwO8lcRX0TU/edit#heading=h.j9sj5edkbf37\"><u>Duffy, 2023</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Here is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_12,_Farm_Animal_Confinement_Initiative_(2018)\"><u>table of major donors</u></a> for the Prop 12 campaign:</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:2pt 16pt 2pt 2pt;vertical-align:top\">Donor</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:2pt 16pt 2pt 2pt;vertical-align:top\">Cash</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:2pt 16pt 2pt 2pt;vertical-align:top\">In-kind</td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:2pt 16pt 2pt 2pt;vertical-align:top\">Total</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Open Philanthropy Action Fund</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>$4,000,000.00</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>$0.00</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>$4,000,000.00</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Deborah_Stone\"><u>Deborah Stone</u></a></p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>$2,650,000.00</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>$0.00</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>$2,650,000.00</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><a href=\"https://ballotpedia.org/Humane_Society_of_the_United_States\"><u>The Humane Society of the United States</u></a></p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>$1,757,500.00</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>$411,605.87</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>$2,169,105.87</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Django Bonderman</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>$500,000.00</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>$0.00</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>$500,000.00</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Zoe Bonderman</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>$500,000.00</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>$0.00</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>$500,000.00</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Kyle Vogt</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>$500,000.00</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>$0.00</p></td><td style=\"border:0.75pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:2pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>$500,000.0</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>This funding table demonstrates that the proponents\u2019 campaign for Prop 12 was funded by a range of individuals and a small number of large organisations.&nbsp;</p><p>Funding for a new intervention could be sought from large grantmakers such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/\"><u>Open Philanthropy</u></a>, and from building personal relationships with interested individuals.&nbsp;</p><p>Should the campaign require funding closer to the upper bound of the predicted range, this will likely necessitate the receipt of sizable grants from EA aligned donors, which is a concern should there be more effective uses of such large sums for the animal movement. A new organisation may struggle to raise so much money, particularly with no track record and limited existing infrastructure. However, an established organisation may have a better chance of raising this.</p><p>Nevertheless, funders do exist who may be able to provide funding for this campaign to a new organisation. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.navigation.org/\"><u>Navigation Fund</u></a> is a new fund which will fund work on farmed animal welfare.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://farmedanimalfunders.org/\"><u>Farmed Animal Funders</u></a> is a group of individuals and foundations who each give more than $250,000 per year to end factory farming, with more than 40 funders involved. Some notable members include Lewis Bollard and Amanda Hungerford of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/\"><u>Open Philanthropy Project</u></a>, John and Timi Sobrato of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sobrato.com/sobrato-philanthropies/\"><u>Sobrato Philanthropies</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.phaunaproject.org/\"><u>Phauna</u></a>, Darren Sparks and Ver\u00f3nica Carrai of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.tpprivatefoundation.org/\"><u>Tipping Point Private Foundation</u></a>, Ariel Nessel of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mobius.life/\"><u>Mobius</u></a>, Chuck and Jennifer Laue of The Quinn Foundation and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://straydoginstitute.org/\"><u>Stray Dog Institute</u></a>, Jim Greenbaum of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.greenbaumfoundation.org/\"><u>Greenbaum Foundation</u></a>.</p><p>The Farmed Animal Funders movement report stated that about $200 million was donated within the farmed animal advocacy movement in 2021, and of this $91 million was focused on North America (<a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/645be31efb5e013b9c6f4751/t/64cb9a7bb5b56917db63457a/1691064968896/FAF+State+of+the+Movement+Report+2021.pdf\"><u>Farmed Animal Funders, 2021</u></a>). ~16% of funding was allocated to government focused advocacy and the most popular animal group to fund were broilers. This suggests that a range of funding opportunities may be available for a new organisation to run this intervention, and that the method, region and animal of focus may be a highly appealing combination to funders.</p><p>Further, given that this intervention would involve collaboration with other organisations, the financial burden may be shared, both directly or in kind. Indeed, in Prop 12, the main proponents, The Humane Society of the US, themselves contributed just under 2.2 million USD, which is about 16.5% of the total raised.&nbsp;</p><p>Table 11: A table of expenditure in 2022 of major organisations who may collaborate on the initiative</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Organisation</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Specific Program Name</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Specific Program Expenditure (million $)</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Total Organisation Expenditure (million $)</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><a href=\"https://www.humanesociety.org/sites/default/files/docs/HSUS-HSI_AR22.pdf\"><u>The Humane Society of the US (2022)</u></a></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">Ending the cruellest practices</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">36.7</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">206.2</td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><a href=\"https://assets.ctfassets.net/ww1ie0z745y7/6zOQ79RJprki52fdLZYBFc/99416005c9a950dd68aa87c021d957b3/2022-annual-report-accessible-PDF-version.pdf#page=3%22target=%22_blank%22\"><u>The Humane League, (2022)</u></a></td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">US public policy and corporate engagement</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">2.46</td><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\">20.76</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><br>Overall, I am significantly but not extremely concerned about the ability of a new organisation to raise the necessary funds to run this initiative, should the costs reach the upper bounds, as this is an extremely high total to generate. A new organisation would not have a track record of success, which some funding organisations may place high weight on when making grants. However, there are a range of potential funders who may fund an organisation doing this work, and the fundraising and resource burden may be shared across collaborating organisations, such that the total that the new charity must raise is more achievable. Given that a popular direction of funding is towards corporate broiler welfare campaigns in the US, this funding may be partially redirected towards this campaign, as that it would address the same welfare concern, just through an alternative pathway of direct democracy. Further, given the strong track record of ballot initiatives in California, this may increase the likelihood of winning grants for this initiative. Nevertheless, this will likely be the largest challenge for a new organisation running this intervention. On the other hand, I expect an existing organisation with an existing budget, a strong track record, no start-up costs and a relationship with donors such as The Humane Society of the US may find it easier to generate the funding required to successfully run this campaign.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Scale of the problem</strong></h3><p>There are 47,621,617 factory farmed broilers in California which belong to fast growing breeds, and there are an estimated 33 billion in the world at present (Pepin, 2022). Although the scale of chicken suffering due to being raised as fast growing breeds is extremely high across the world, ballot initiatives only exist in a small number of states, 26 US states, Switzerland and Taiwan. In the US in 2017, out of the states where ballot initiatives are possible, just under 500 million broilers were farmed. Therefore, this intervention strategy can only be applied to a small proportion of this problem (roughly 1.5%).</p><h3><strong>Neglectedness</strong></h3><p>No organisations appear to have set plans to run a ballot initiative to improve broiler welfare in US states. Although organisations such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thehumaneleague.org/\"><u>The Humane League</u></a> work on outreaching to companies to gain commitments to improve broiler welfare, they have only succeeded in capturing a small proportion of the market and the rate of progress is plateauing.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Tractability</strong></h3><p>I think this is very tractable, given recent successes with this intervention strategy, in this region. See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rUloTYBOCuLYJyddzijUO52NcHApetgRJwO8lcRX0TU/edit#heading=h.1k79pn8axaqc\"><u>section 3.1</u></a> for further details on tractability. It is important to note, the outcome of the proposed EATS legislation must be monitored, although this is judged to have a moderately low likelihood of passing, it would prevent states from regulating the production and distribution of agricultural products within their borders that are subject to interstate commerce, which would significantly undermine the scale of the welfare benefits of this intervention.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Externalities</strong></h3><p>Positive Externalities&nbsp;</p><p>As seen with cage free campaigns, production and sales bans of caged eggs in a small number of states won through ballot initiatives has triggered other states to implement similar legislation, so that their producers can access markets in other states (<a href=\"https://cagefreelaws.com/\"><u>CageFreeLaws, 2023</u></a>). Notably, a leading agricultural economist Jayson Lusk states that California is a net importer of animal products, despite high domestic production, due to its high populus, meaning that a sales ban included in this initiative may impact the practice of other states (<a href=\"https://jaysonlusk.com/blog/2017/11/1/how-much-does-your-state-rely-on-other-states-for-food\"><u>Lusk, 2017</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond this, running a coordinated campaign to improve broiler welfare, between different interest groups including animal welfare, environmental, food security groups and high welfare producers may create networks, relationships and public awareness that can be leveraged for further work on animal welfare. In particular, relationships with policymakers may be formed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Negative Externalities&nbsp;</p><p>The main negative externality that I identify with is the impact of losing this campaign upon momentum for other animal welfare campaigns in California, or indeed wider in the US. It may be taken as a signal that consumers are not concerned about broiler welfare, and hinder the progress of corporate campaigns for the adoption of the Better Chicken Commitment. However, given that the rates of uptake are low, this may provide an alternative avenue to make progress on this issue.&nbsp;</p><p><br><br>&nbsp;</p><h1>9 &nbsp; &nbsp; Directing funding towards an existing entity</h1><p>Overall, this intervention may be best placed in the hands of an existing organisation. This is because it requires significant funding, a large and diverse network, expertise of the US political system and a reliable volunteer network. In particular, they may rely on non-EA sources of funding.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.humanesociety.org/\"><u>The Humane Society of the US</u></a> (HSUS) have led the 4 most recent ballot initiatives for cage free standards, and as such are well placed to continue this work for broiler welfare. Further,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thehumaneleague.org/\"><u>The Humane League</u></a> may also be well placed, however this may hinder their work with producers.&nbsp;</p><p>However, some caveats to an existing organisation taking this on are if they have poor relationships with other groups, particularly animal advocacy groups and farming associations, as a diverse and strong coalition is important for the success of this intervention, as well as if they have a bad reputation amongst the public or with producers. Further, they may have diverse programs and be unable to commit sufficient resources to this intervention.</p><p>It is curious that HSUS have not decided to embark on broiler welfare ballot initiatives, given their track record with cage free ballot initiatives, therefore I recommend getting into contact with representatives from HSUS to understand whether they have plans for this or concerns about this idea. I have attempted to make contact with several representatives however have thus far been unsuccessful.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h1>10 Conclusion</h1><p>Overall, I&nbsp;<strong>strongly recommend</strong> this intervention to be carried out by an&nbsp;<strong>existing organisation</strong> and I&nbsp;<strong>tentatively recommend</strong> this intervention to be implemented by a&nbsp;<strong>new</strong>&nbsp;<strong>charity incubated by CE</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>This intervention requires strong relationships with other animal welfare, environmental and farming groups, access to large funds, a reliable volunteer network and experience planning public awareness or mass media campaigns. From my initial research, I fairly strongly hold the view that if done right, ballot initiatives for broiler welfare could trigger widespread reforms that improve welfare across many US states as seen with the cage-free ballot initiatives, particularly as initiatives targeting both production and sales would require exporters from other states to raise their standards. In this way, I think there is a large upshot that is not fully represented in the CEA. However, this is dependent upon success, which has a much higher probability when run by an organisation with the aforementioned traits.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, the outcome of the proposed EATS legislation must be monitored before this intervention is carried out. Although this is judged to have a moderately low likelihood of passing, it would prevent states from regulating the production and distribution of agricultural products within their borders that are subject to interstate commerce, which would significantly undermine the scale of the welfare benefits of this intervention.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I would recommend the next step be to make contact with representatives from the<strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"http://humanesociety.org/\"><strong><u>Humane Society of the United States</u></strong></a>, in order to learn whether they have plans to continue their work on past ballot initiatives and whether they would be interested in&nbsp; carrying out this intervention.&nbsp;</p><h1>References</h1><p>Animal Legal Defense Fund.

The present post sets out a few ideas for what an animal-inclusive AI landscape might look like: what efforts would we need to see from different actors in order for AI to be beneficial for animals? This is just a list of high-level suggestions, and I haven\u2019t tried to prioritize them, explore them in detail, or suggest practical ways to bring them about. I also haven\u2019t touched on the (<a href=\"https://new-harvest.org/app/uploads/2022/12/LitReview_ML_ZacharyCosenza.pdf\"><u>potentially extremely significant</u></a>) role of alternative proteins in all this.&nbsp;</p><p>We also have a new landing page for people interested in the intersection of AI and animals:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.aiforanimals.org\"><u>www.aiforanimals.org</u></a>. It\u2019s still fairly basic at this stage but contains links to resources and recent news articles that you might find helpful if you\u2019re interested in this space. Please feel free to provide feedback to help make this a more useful resource.&nbsp;</p><h1>Why do we need animal-inclusive AI?</h1><p>As described in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/ZNcdt7eYWW7YXALvx/what-ai-could-mean-for-animals,\"><u>previous post</u></a>, future AI advances could further disempower animals and increase the depth and scale of their suffering. However,&nbsp; AI could also help bring about a radical improvement in human-animal relations and greatly facilitate efforts to improve animals\u2019 wellbeing.</p><p>For example, just in the last month, news articles have covered potential AI risks for animals including&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vietnamnet.vn/en/mekong-delta-farmers-using-ai-for-super-intensive-shrimp-raising-2223941.html\"><u>AI\u2019s role in intensive shrimp farming</u></a>, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cordis.europa.eu/article/id/447898-towards-sustainability-in-meat-production\"><u>EU-funded \u2018RoBUTCHER\u2019</u></a> that will help automate the pig meat processing industry, (potentially&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/danieladelorenzo/2023/11/09/this-norwegian-ai-powered-startup-has-big-plans-for-the-meat-industry/\"><u>making intensive animal agriculture more profitable</u></a>), and the potential of Large Language Models to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sentientmedia.org/ai-bias-speciesism/\"><u>entrench speciesist biases</u></a>. On the more positive side, there were also articles covering the potential for AI to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/enhancing-animal-welfare-ai-reshaping-155300332.html\"><u>radically improve animal health treatment</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.qualityassurancemag.com/news/heura-uses-toolsgroup-for-digital-supply-chain-transformation-to-support-global-expansion/\"><u>support the expansion</u></a> of alternative protein companies,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theweathernetwork.com/en/news/nature/animals/new-bear-dar-aims-to-keep-communities-and-polar-bears-safe\"><u>reduce human-animal conflicts</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/nov/04/scientists-turn-to-ai-for-help-translate-animal-vocal-physical-cues\"><u>facilitate human-animal communication</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sentientmedia.org/ai-model-spare-animals-lab-testing/\"><u>provide alternatives</u></a> to animal testing. These recent stories are just the tip of the iceberg, not only for animals that are being directly exploited \u2013 or cared for \u2013&nbsp;by humans, but also for those living in the wild.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>AI safety for animals doesn\u2019t need to come at the expense of AI safety for humans. There are bound to be many actions that both the animal advocacy and AI safety communities can take to reinforce each others\u2019 work, given the considerable overlap in our priorities and worldviews. However, there are also bound to be some complex trade-offs, and we can\u2019t assume that efforts to make AI safe for humans will inevitably also benefit all other species. In fact, it seems feasible that AI could bring about huge improvements to human wellbeing (e.g., by accelerating&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/intelligence/pages/ai-may-start-to-boost-us-gdp-in-2027.html\"><u>economic growth</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/26/ai-personalise-medicine-patient-lab-health-diagnosis-cambridge\"><u>advances in healthcare</u></a>) while being a disaster for other animals. Targeted efforts are needed to prevent that happening, including (but definitely not limited to):</p><ul><li>Explicitly mentioning animals in written commitments, both non-binding and binding;</li><li>Using those commitments as a stepping stone to ensure animal-inclusive applications of AI;</li><li>Representing animals in decision-making processes;</li><li>Conducting and publishing more research on AI\u2019s potential impacts on animals; and</li><li>Building up the \u2018AI safety x animal advocacy\u2019 community.</li></ul><p>The rest of this post provides some information, examples, and resources around those topics.</p><h1>Moving towards animal-inclusive AI</h1><h2>Explicitly mention animals in non-binding commitments</h2><h3><i>Governmental commitments</i></h3><p>On November 1, 2023, 29 countries signed the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/ai-safety-summit-2023-the-bletchley-declaration/the-bletchley-declaration-by-countries-attending-the-ai-safety-summit-1-2-november-2023\"><u>Bletchley Declaration</u></a> at the AI Safety Summit hosted by the UK. This Declaration begins:</p><p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents enormous global opportunities: it has the potential to transform and enhance human wellbeing, peace and prosperity. To realise this, we affirm that, for the good of all, AI should be designed, developed, deployed, and used, in a manner that is safe, in such a way as to be human-centric, trustworthy and responsible. We welcome the international community\u2019s efforts so far to cooperate on AI to promote inclusive economic growth, sustainable development and innovation, to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms, and to foster public trust and confidence in AI systems to fully realise their potential.</p><p>This seems like a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2023-11-03-expert-comment-oxford-ai-experts-comment-outcomes-uk-ai-safety-summit\"><u>significant positive contribution</u></a> towards global AI safety for humanity. However, safety for non-human animals was (predictably) absent, both from the Declaration and the Summit more broadly. While these kinds of non-binding agreements don\u2019t actually commit signatories to take action, they do coordinate governments around a shared intention and send a public message about the kinds of things we should value as a global community. Even if humans manage to keep AI systems totally under our control, this is unlikely to benefit animals without some meaningful display of political will<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefo4jo9javhbe\"><sup><a href=\"#fno4jo9javhbe\">[1]</a></sup></span>. And even for governments who don\u2019t actually sign any such treaty, just its existence and international recognition can help solidify global norms around a particular issue.&nbsp;</p><p>A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SZp9h2HulIUrmVAhRhI_GrVDhAGeIMyR/view\"><u>review of public AI materials</u></a>&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjfzetnqc6r\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjfzetnqc6r\">[2]</a></sup></span>found that 0 out of 77 AI/computer ethics courses, 7 out of over 200 papers and books on AI ethics and alignment, and 1 out of 73 AI ethics principles or statements included a discussion of animals. The AI ethics statement that included animals was that of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://demo.paragraf.rs/demo/combined/Old/t/t2023_03/SG_023_2023_007.htm\"><u>Serbian Government</u></a>, which states in its first paragraph that the development of artificial intelligence systems must be in line with the well-being of humans, animals and the environment, and which includes animals\u2019 capacity for pain, suffering, fear, and stress in its definition of ethics.&nbsp;</p><p>Animals are also mentioned in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu/en/library/ethics-guidelines-trustworthy-ai\"><u>Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence</u></a>, published in 2019 by the EU\u2019s High-Level Expert Group on AI. The guidelines\u2019 \u2018Trustworthy AI Assessment List\u2019 for consideration by AI practitioners includes the question \u2018Did you consider the potential impact or safety risk to the environment or to animals?\u2019 While truly animal-inclusive guidelines would need to have animal interests more firmly embedded throughout, rather than in a single bullet point, the fact that these guidelines explicitly reference animals at all could serve as a helpful precedent<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefcv53666zjb\"><sup><a href=\"#fncv53666zjb\">[3]</a></sup></span>. However, these guidelines were produced by an advisory group rather than the EU Commission, and there do not seem to be any references to animals in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex%3A52021PC0206\"><u>current draft</u></a> of the EU\u2019s AI Act.</p><h3><i>Company commitments</i></h3><p>Most AI companies have themselves published some sort of non-binding mission statement setting out their commitment to ensuring that AI is a net-positive for humanity, such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/charter\"><u>OpenAI Charter</u></a> and Anthropic\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/index/claudes-constitution\"><u>in-house constitution</u></a> (which includes principles based on the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and various other sources)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefb3ljbj2flo\"><sup><a href=\"#fnb3ljbj2flo\">[4]</a></sup></span>. &nbsp;Again, animals are notably absent from these mission statements and again, while we should be very wary of corporate lip service, their inclusion seems like a necessary first step to ensuring that the AI systems they develop respect animals\u2019 interests. Ideally, these efforts would be motivated both by a genuine understanding of the ethical grounds for animal-inclusive policies and by a desire to shore up their ethical credentials.</p><p>Depending on the nature of the company and its mission statements, the approach might go beyond just including animals at relevant points in the text. For example, companies who take a similar \u2018constitutional\u2019 approach to Anthropic could also include declarations concerning animal rights alongside those on human rights. While there are currently&nbsp;<a href=\"https://guides.ll.georgetown.edu/InternationalAnimalLaw/treaties\"><u>no international treaties of this sort</u></a>, other models exist such as the \u200b\u200bacademic-led&nbsp;<a href=\"https://greea.ca/en/nouvelles/montreal-declaration-on-animal-exploitation/\"><u>Montreal Declaration on Animal Exploitation</u></a> (not to be confused with the also relevant&nbsp;<a href=\"https://declarationmontreal-iaresponsable.com/la-declaration/\"><u>Montreal Declaration for the Responsible Development of AI</u></a>). Moves in this direction by the more ethically oriented developers like Anthropic and OpenAI could help to put animal-inclusive AI on the radar of other developers, as well as governments, investors, and the general public. Further down the line, CEOs of leading AI companies might also put their names to statements including AI risks to animals, similar to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.safe.ai/statement-on-ai-risk#open-letter\"><u>Statement on AI Risk</u></a> signed by the CEOs of OpenAI, Anthropic, Google DeepMind, among others<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6a421huwr3w\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6a421huwr3w\">[5]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><i>Representation of animals in AI decision-making</i></h3><p>Another opportunity to represent animals in these kinds of mission statements comes from efforts to ensure democratic decision-making in AI. For example, Anthropic\u2019s second&nbsp;<a href=\"https://efficient-manatee.files.svdcdn.com/production/images/CCAI_public_comparison_2023-1.pdf?dm=1697475572\"><u>subsequent public constitution</u></a> was drawn up following a public consultation process with the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cip.org/\"><u>Collective Intelligence Project</u></a> (who are piloting structures for collective governance of generative AI and exploring how to ensure AI brings about public goods). Relatedly, OpenAI announced earlier this year that they are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/democratic-inputs-to-ai\"><u>launching a program to award grants</u></a> to experiments in setting up a democratic process (involving a \u2018broadly representative group of people\u2019) for deciding what rules AI systems should follow so that AGI can benefit all of humanity. Clearly, these kinds of democratic decision-making processes could actually run counter to animals\u2019 interests, if the people consulted don\u2019t themselves view animals as morally relevant. This highlights the need to ensure that the consulted group is at least somewhat representative of all sentient beings that are likely to be impacted by AI systems. Incorporating the views of vegans and animal activists would be a start, but not sufficient, as this only accounts for the secondhand benefits that humans get from seeing animals well treated, rather than acknowledging the direct benefits to the animals themselves.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Some have argued that representation of non-human animals in these kinds of decision-making process is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pNHH953sgSConBmzF/taking-into-account-sentient-non-humans-in-ai-ambitious\"><u>inherently anti-democratic</u></a>, based on the assumption that most humans wouldn\u2019t opt for a framework that extends some degree of moral agency to non-human animals, and that only humans are entitled to having their interests represented in democratic decision-making processes. However, if you think that at least some non-human animals are sentient, that this affords them some degree of moral patienthood, and that non-human animals therefore stand to lose or gain from AI advances in morally relevant ways, it seems logical that we should seek ways to represent them in one way or another. (See below for more discussion around democratic representation of non-human animals.)</p><h3><i>Tangible actions by companies</i></h3><p>Inclusion of animals in these kinds of materials could help ensure animals are included in companies\u2019 risk assessments. For example, Microsoft\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blogs.microsoft.com/wp-content/uploads/prod/sites/5/2022/06/Microsoft-RAI-Impact-Assessment-Template.pdf\"><u>Responsible AI Impact Assessment Template</u></a>, which is designed to assess \u2018the impact an AI system may have on people, organizations, and society\u2019, could in principle easily be used to list risks to animals\u2019 interests<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreftbpijkadjx\"><sup><a href=\"#fntbpijkadjx\">[6]</a></sup></span>. &nbsp;This would be a logical next step for companies who had already explicitly included animals in their mission statements, and could also be explicitly required by governments, such as in Biden\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/\"><u>Executive Order</u></a>. Such efforts could also be supported by organizations such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://evals.alignment.org/\"><u>METR</u></a> (formerly ARC Evals), who currently work on assessing whether AI systems could pose catastrophic risks to civilization (including through partnerships with Anthropic and OpenAI), with future projects likely to include certifying companies that show commitment to ensuring their AI systems are safe before building or deploying them. While unlikely to happen in the short term (given that METR currently appears to be the only major organization doing this work, and it\u2019s still at a very early stage), future similar initiatives could play a key role in holding companies accountable for the potential impacts of their models on non-human animals and highlighting clear examples of best practice.&nbsp;</p><p>A clear tangible action for AI companies who had included animals in their mission statements and risk assessments would be to limit, or eliminate, speciesist biases in their models. Current Large Language Models (LLMs)&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sentientmedia.org/ai-bias-speciesism/\"><u>exhibit speciesist biases</u></a>, reflecting the speciesist nature of the corpus that they have been trained on. For example, LLM responses currently tend to condemn the slaughter and consumption of animals such as cats and dogs, while condoning the slaughter and consumption of animals such as pigs, chickens, and fish. (For further examples, see \u2018<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-022-00199-9\"><u>Speciesist bias in AI: how AI applications perpetuate discrimination and unfair outcomes against animals</u></a>\u2019.) AI companies already have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s43681-022-00199-9#citeas\"><u>range of tools</u></a> at their disposal to address these kinds of biases such as by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://farmanimalwelfare.substack.com/p/what-could-ai-mean-for-animals#:~:text=instructing%20fine%2Dtuning%20contractors%20to%20choose%20the%20model%20output%20that%20least%20harms%20animals\"><u>instructing their fine-tuning contractors</u></a> to choose the outputs that are the least harmful to animals.&nbsp;</p><p>Another tangible way for companies to put their money where their mouth is would be to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://farmanimalwelfare.substack.com/p/what-could-ai-mean-for-animals#:~:text=Third%2C%20to%20add%20factory%20farms%20to%20the%20labs%E2%80%99%20long%20lists%20of%20nefarious%20clients%20that%20they%20pledge%20not%20to%20do%20business%20with.\"><u>refuse to work with industries that depend on the exploitation of animals</u></a>, such as factory farms. However, it could be counterproductive if only the more ethically minded companies opted for this approach, leaving the animal agriculture industry to work with less scrupulous AI developers who are less likely to be concerned about the genuine welfare implications of any on-farm AI systems that they help to create. A more general move that could also help support animal-inclusive efforts would be for companies to re-think their governance structures: rather than set up as standard corporations, which by default must serve shareholders\u2019 interests rather than society at large, they could opt for a more&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/what-ai-companies-can-do-today-to-help-with-the-most-important-century/\"><u>public-benefit-oriented approach</u></a> (though the<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/23966325/openai-sam-altman-fired-turmoil-chatgpt\"><u> recent events at OpenAI</u></a>, with its \u2018capped-profit\u2019 hybrid NGO-corporation model, have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/nov/28/artificial-intelligence-openai-non-profit-money\"><u>cast some doubt</u></a> on the effectiveness of that approach).&nbsp;</p><p>Seeking these kinds of specific improvements directly from industry could be particularly important given that there is currently so little government regulation of AI, with the most important decisions about AI models being&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8KhGio2rhgHgsBoZ6/a-summary-of-current-work-in-ai-governance\"><u>disproportionately made</u></a> by a small number of people at the leading AI companies. However, governmental action also seems necessary: not just to avoid a scenario where a few influential companies end up disproportionately controlling a technology that will affect the whole world, but also because the average company trying to use AI responsibly is currently confronted by a huge amount of information and considerations that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/tantum-collins-ai-policy-insider/\"><u>governments should help clarify</u></a>, whether through binding regulations or soft guidance.&nbsp;</p><h2>Explicitly mention animals in binding commitments</h2><p>While inclusion in non-binding commitments would be a useful start, animals\u2019 interests will also need to be protected in more specific legislation, with sanctions for non-compliance. The relevant regulations are likely to cut across a wide range of domains. Coghlan and Parker outline this in \u2018<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-023-00627-6\"><u>Harm to Nonhuman Animals from AI: a Systematic Account and Framework</u></a>\u2019: \u2018concerns about harmful AI impacts on animals will likely need to be addressed in animal welfare laws and regulations and in a host of other laws and policies, such as traffic regulations, safety mandates for automated vehicles and drones, environmental protection laws, and laws designed to regulate AI more generally.\u2019</p><p>This also applies to AI deployment by the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nexocode.com/blog/posts/ai-based-smart-farming-machine-learning-in-livestock-farming/\"><u>intensive animal agriculture industry</u></a>, such as to monitor animal behavior, predict disease outbreaks, and optimize feeding schedules. These industries need to be held fully accountable for their use of AI and its impacts on animals, which will require stringent top-down government regulations (in addition to other incentives, such as making compliance with certain optional standards a condition for government contracts, as well as non-governmental methods, such as lobbying campaigns by advocacy organizations, and recognition schemes for industry best-practice). The industry is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aiforanimals.org/blog-1/blog-post-title-one-4emma\"><u>already arguing</u></a> that all efforts to maximize profitability using AI will near-inevitably maximize welfare. Governments already typically defer to animal agriculture corporations to set the standard when it comes to animal welfare, despite their obvious vested interests in profit over the animals\u2019 wellbeing, and the use of AI will only further exacerbate this problem. AI systems could even begin to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13347-023-00627-6#ref-CR185\"><u>define animal welfare standards</u></a>, rather than just assess compliance with them. While this could theoretically result in welfare standards that are driven more by data than by humans\u2019 vested interests, it could also produce seemingly objective, evidence-driven measurements that in reality only affect the animals\u2019 health and productivity rather than their actual wellbeing.&nbsp;</p><p>The 2023 EU Parliament report \u2018<a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2023/734711/EPRS_STU(2023)734711_EN.pdf\"><u>Artificial intelligence in the agri-food sector</u></a>\u2019 provides a sense of what animal agriculture AI policy might look like in practice, setting out specific recommendations for AI\u2019s integration in the EU\u2019s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP):</p><ul><li>Data-driven technology should be integrated into the official animal welfare standards, reducing the use of the subjective, one-off assessments currently being carried out.</li><li>Labels on animal-derived products should include objective data derived from on-farm sensors.</li><li>ISO (International Standardization Organization) standards on the design of animal monitoring technologies should be adopted by the industry.</li></ul><p>Likewise, it will be necessary for the outcomes of any AI-assisted assessments to be available to objective regulatory bodies, not just companies\u2019 leadership, to ensure that these assessments lead to meaningful changes.&nbsp; (This assumes that regulators will have sufficient funding, capacity, authority, and understanding of the field to review the assessment outcomes, which is far from certain given governments\u2019 current deprioritization of resources towards animal welfare policy and enforcement.) For example, AI assessments might highlight such low levels of welfare, or such high rates of mishandling by farmers, that animal agriculture companies decide to simply ignore the outcomes or drastically dial down the models\u2019 sensitivity so that they only flag the most extreme instances of cruelty or suffering.</p><p>As AI advances become increasingly relevant across a whole swathe of industries, it will be impossible to introduce new legislation to ensure the responsible use of AI in every single use case. Cross-cutting, mandatory principles will be necessary for guiding the development of animal-inclusive AI. For example, Biden\u2019s recent \u2018<a href=\"https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2023/10/30/fact-sheet-president-biden-issues-executive-order-on-safe-secure-and-trustworthy-artificial-intelligence/\"><u>Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence</u></a>\u2019 will \u2018require that developers of the most powerful AI systems share their safety test results and other critical information with the U.S. government\u2019 and \u2018develop standards, tools, and tests to help ensure that AI systems are safe, secure, and trustworthy\u2019. It specifically mentions the need to ensure that AI is safe for various groups, such as consumers, patients, students, workers, entrepreneurs, and small businesses. Adding animals to such lists of stakeholders would be a useful step, and though this is likely to be a hard sell, there are at least some promising precedents to build on. For example, the UK\u2019s recent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2022/22/contents/enacted\"><u>Sentience Act</u></a> requires policy-makers to consider animals\u2019 interests when making or changing laws (at least in principle \u2013 the UK\u2019s current Government doesn\u2019t seem to be taking that commitment&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/on-animal-welfare-the-uk-should-lead-not-fall-behind/\"><u>very seriously</u></a>).</p><p>Such efforts require some degree of non-human animal representation in key decision-making bodies, such as the USA\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nist.gov/artificial-intelligence/artificial-intelligence-safety-institute\"><u>AI Institute</u></a>, the UK\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/frontier-ai-taskforce-first-progress-report/frontier-ai-taskforce-first-progress-report\"><u>Frontier AI Task Force</u></a>, and the UN\u2019s new&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.un.org/en/ai-advisory-body\"><u>High-level Advisory Body on Artificial Intelligence</u></a>, set up to \u2018offer diverse perspectives and options on how AI can be governed for the common good\u2019. There\u2019s precedent for this kind of representation; for example, at the national level, the German government recently created an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://animalsociety.de/new-commissioner-for-animal-welfare-in-germany/\"><u>office for animal welfare</u></a>, with a permanent position dedicated to the representation of animals\u2019 interests. This success was due in part to the efforts of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://animalsociety.de/\"><u>Animal Society</u></a> and their international campaign network&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.representinganimals.org/\"><u>Representing Animals</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://animalsintheroom.org/\"><u>Animals in the Room</u></a> is another example of an organization seeking to ensure that animals are properly represented in key decision-making processes. These initiatives build on the political theory and discussion surrounding the democratic representation of hard-to-represent human groups, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://johnwall.camden.rutgers.edu/files/2012/08/Can-Democracy-Represent-Children.pdf\"><u>children</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/abs/disability-and-political-theory/rethinking-membership-and-participation-in-an-inclusive-democracy/7179604B15023DF48CF0E0494EC53CA3\"><u>people with disabilities</u></a>.</p><p>Extending equal consideration to all sentient beings impacted by AI systems won\u2019t always be straightforward, or even possible. For example, even if&nbsp;<a href=\"https://faunalytics.org/bringing-animals-into-ai-ethics/\"><u>self-driving cars</u></a> can be made to detect smaller animals to avoid hitting them, efforts to achieve this might make the technology physically unwieldy or difficult to sell. Drivers might also be unwilling to make the necessary trade-offs that would allow this; for example, to travel in a car that avoids entire roads that cross the migration routes of crabs or other animals. More fundamentally, humans appointed to represent animals\u2019 interests will inevitably have an imperfect view of what animals actually want and need, as opposed to just what humans&nbsp;<i>assume</i> they want and need. But these are still important discussions to have, even if they will often be complex and involve some difficult trade-offs.&nbsp;</p><p>At the UN level specifically, such efforts to ensure animal representation are also made harder by the fact that animal welfare is not currently included in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sdgs.un.org/goals\"><u>UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals</u></a> (SDGs). Promisingly, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/24797GSDR_report_2019.pdf\"><u>2019 UN Global Sustainable Development Report</u></a> did identify animal welfare as a key missing issue in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs, and various advocacy groups are campaigning for an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sdg18.org/\"><u>additional SDG focussed on eliminating animal exploitation</u></a>. If successful, this would provide a stronger basis for future efforts to ensure animal representation in UN governance.</p><h2>Publish more research on AI\u2019s potential impacts on animals</h2><p>While there is some excellent research exploring the significance of AI for animals (see e.g. the research papers listed under \u2018Key resources\u2019 on the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aiforanimals.org/resources-1\"><u>AI for Animals website</u></a>), this is still a relatively unexplored area. Additional research would help to identify the key leverage points for decreasing the risks for animals from AI (such as pragmatic ways to include animals in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/pNHH953sgSConBmzF/taking-into-account-sentient-non-humans-in-ai-ambitious\"><u>AI value learning</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2303.12642.pdf\"><u>AI democratization efforts</u></a>), communicate the nature of these risks more broadly, establish this as a field worthy of consideration, and build relationships with key stakeholders (e.g. AI safety researchers) outside of the animal advocacy movement. This could include a greater focus on animal interests and speciesist biases within the field of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.05700.pdf\"><u>fairness research</u></a>, which focuses specifically on techniques to address&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.09003\"><u>algorithmic bias</u></a>. This will be increasingly important as AI ethics experts are invited to join bodies such as the UN\u2019s Advisory Body and the UK\u2019s Frontier AI Task Force.&nbsp;</p><p>To help achieve this, non-profit organizations, government agencies, universities, and other academic institutions could create research fellowships designed both to support researchers in animal advocacy-related fields to move into the AI safety space, and to support AI safety researchers to move into animal advocacy-related fields, to help increase the number of researchers straddling the two areas. Similar fellowships already exist, such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ai4good.org/\"><u>AI for Good Foundation</u></a>\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ai4good.org/what-we-do/fellowships/\"><u>Summer Fellowship Program</u></a>, which offers participants the chance \u2018gain real world experience at the intersection of Sustainability and Artificial Intelligence &amp; Machine Learning\u2019. The interests of non-human animals could also be included in AI-relevant education curricula, such as the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/\"><u>AI Safety Fundamentals course</u></a>. Likewise, once the field is more advanced, researchers could create courses specifically focused on the AI safety risks to non-human animals.&nbsp;</p><p>Awareness-raising efforts by researchers could also seek to bridge the two fields. For example, in October 2022 over 500 academics published the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://greea.ca/en/nouvelles/montreal-declaration-on-animal-exploitation/\"><u>Montreal Declaration on Animal Exploitation</u></a>, which \u2018condemn[s] the practices that involve treating animals as objects or commodities\u2019. Similar future efforts could also focus on the need to ensure that all efforts are taken to ensure that AI does not entail significant animal suffering. Researchers could also continue to seek publication of their work in mainstream media; some examples of outlets that are already doing this well include Sentient Media (such as recent articles on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sentientmedia.org/ai-bias-speciesism/\"><u>speciesist biases in AI</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sentientmedia.org/ai-bias-speciesism/\"><u>AI-assisted intensive farming</u></a>) and Vox (such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.vox.com/the-highlight/23777171/ai-animals-rights-cruelty-transhumanism-bostrom\"><u>their recent article</u></a> on the parallels between AI safety risks and humans\u2019 own treatment of non-human animals), which will hopefully pave the way for other larger outlets to follow suit.</p><h2>Build up the \u2018AI safety x animal advocacy\u2019 community</h2><p>Existing animal advocacy organizations could expand their scope to include AI-specific initiatives. This could include campaigns work (such as targeted lobbying of the animal agriculture industry to ensure that they use AI in a responsible way, or engaging key decision-makers to ensure representation of animals in AI legislation) and awareness-raising work such as organizing seminars, conferences, and workshops, and engaging the public through videos, podcasts, and infographics. For organizations unfamiliar with AI, understanding how they could use AI tools to enhance the effectiveness of the advocacy campaigns could be a useful starting point. Some useful resources in this space include the organization&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nfps.ai/\"><u>NFPS.AI</u></a> (which provides not-for-profit organizations with direct access to the latest AI knowledge and tools),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://veg3.ai/\"><u>VEG3</u></a> (an AI-powered tool specifically designed to help animal rights advocates be more impactful in their work), and recent webinars on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vqngQLeNsok\"><u>Harnessing AI for Animal Advocacy Campaigns</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s813IqT-rxo\"><u>AI &amp; ChatGPT in the Movement</u></a> by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.straydoginstitute.org/\"><u>Stray Dog Institute</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://veganhacktivists.org/\"><u>Vegan Hacktivists</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plantbasednews.org/\"><u>Plant Based News</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Advocates could also create new non-profit organizations (like the recently launched&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/sam-tucker-vegan_open-paws-won-the-jury-award-at-the-kickstarting-activity-7141056833368014849-0hDd\"><u>Open Paws</u></a>) and alliances, potentially following a similar model to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aifortheplanet.org/en/content/about-us\"><u>AI for the Planet Alliance</u></a> or the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ai4good.org/\"><u>AI for Good Foundation</u></a>, or forming partnerships with these organizations. Finding common points of interest would be a useful start here; for example, looking at AI for the Planet\u2019s entrants to their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aifortheplanet.org/en/registration/call-for-solutions\"><u>2022 \u2018Call for Solutions\u2019</u></a>, one finalist (<a href=\"https://www.aifortheplanet.org/en/registration/call-for-solutions\"><u>Kayrros</u></a>) was focussed on measuring wildfire risk, which is also a major danger for animals. (Of course, there are also clear points of divergence: another of their finalists (<a href=\"https://www.aifortheplanet.org/en/registration/call-for-solutions\"><u>Aquaconnect</u></a>) is working to scale up the aquaculture industry.)</p><p>Some activities carried out by AI for the Planet Alliance that could also be relevant for the \u2018AI for Animals\u2019 space include: putting out a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aifortheplanet.org/en/registration/call-for-solutions\"><u>public call for proposals</u></a> for how to use AI for the good of the planet (with prizes for the best ideas);&nbsp;<a href=\"https://cdn-assets.inwink.com/de3a211c-d522-4534-8cb8-65999ca21469/c62eeb95-4510-4dbc-9256-41cecffec46d?sv=2018-03-28&amp;sr=b&amp;sig=%2F3XoAqqSuH0FciTEys66oQCOz%2FkobYBD0MdYd3CwjF8%3D&amp;se=9999-12-31T23%3A59%3A59Z&amp;sp=r&amp;rscd=inline%3B%20filename%3D%22AI%2520for%2520the%2520Planet%2520x%2520BCG%2520report%2520-%2520July%25202022%2520-%2520vFinal2.pdf%22\"><u>publishing a report</u></a> on AI climate solutions; and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://media.un.org/en/asset/k1y/k1ynu1wku1\"><u>organizing conferences</u></a>, including at UN events. (Future AI and animals conferences could also build on the recent Princeton conference on \u2018<a href=\"https://uchv.princeton.edu/events/artificial-intelligence-conscious-machines-and-animals-broadening-ai-ethics\"><u>Artificial Intelligence, Conscious Machines, and Animals: Broadening AI Ethics</u></a>\u2019). The AI for Good Foundation, meanwhile, seeks to \u2018identify, prototype, and scale solutions that engender positive social change\u2019. In addition to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ai4good.org/what-we-do/fellowships/\"><u>fellowship program</u></a> mentioned above, their projects include an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ai4good.org/ethics/\"><u>auditing initiative</u></a> to ensure responsible use of AI by businesses, and an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ai4good.org/sdg-catalyst/\"><u>SDG catalyst initiative</u></a> to channel private investment into organizations using AI to help achieve the UN\u2019s Sustainable Development Goals (another example of why it would be useful to have an SDG focussed on animal exploitation).

This kind of world-building might help more people understand AI\u2019s tangible implications for animals.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>The deployment of advanced AI brings huge risks for animals. However, in a world where trillions of animals are already suffering and being exploited,&nbsp;<i>not</i> deploying advanced AI in a way that will genuinely improve their lives also risks foregoing enormous benefits.&nbsp;</p><p>Animal-inclusive AI will require an enormous concerted effort on multiple fronts. Most of that effort will probably be exerted by people working outside of the AI/animals intersection: by animal advocates whose work helps to ensure that the moral economy in which AI systems emerge is a compassionate one, and by AI safety experts whose work to make AI safe for humanity are likely to have some massive spillover benefits for non-human animals.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it will also almost certainly require a thriving community of people seeking to bridge those two fields within politics, academia, industry, the nonprofit sector, journalism, and a broad swathe of other domains.

I use this observation to develop the&nbsp;<i>Biology Argument&nbsp;</i>which directly argues against the possibility of replicating consciousness in silicon, contesting&nbsp;<i>CT<sub>1&nbsp;</sub></i>and&nbsp;<i>CT<sub>2</sub></i>. After refuting objections to the observation and the&nbsp;<i>Biology Argument</i>, I argue that&nbsp;<i>M2</i> is a consequence of my arguments for M1. Since Chalmers\u2019 arguments are some of the very few in the literature that formulate an argument in favour of Artificial Consciousness, this paper attempts to execute the crucial task of evaluating their success.&nbsp;</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>1.1 Defining Qualia&nbsp;</h3><p>\u2018Qualia\u2019 denote subjective experiences like seeing the colour red or smelling cologne. In Thomas Nagel\u2019s words (1974), there is something it is like to have these experiences, they have a concrete phenomenal character such that seeing the colour red is subjectively very different from seeing the colour green. The word \u2018quale\u2019 (synonymous with consciousness here) then denotes this subjective character of the experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Notably, an extensive philosophical debate surrounds the question of what qualia are. For instance, some philosophers take qualia to be properties of our inner mental representations of objects (Lewis, 1929) others take the word to denote non-physical and infallible properties of an experience that are somehow \u201cgiven\u201d to the subject (Dennet, 1991). Further still, some people argue that our experiences only&nbsp;<i>seem&nbsp;</i>to have phenomenal properties as a result of our introspection, making qualia a mere illusion (Frankish, 2016).&nbsp;</p><p>Without delving into this debate; it suffices to say that Chalmers\u2019 arguments go through under the definition of subjective experiences in the first paragraph (call this the Minimal Qualia Assumption)<strong>.</strong>&nbsp;</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>1.2 How do qualia depend on physical properties?</h3><p>This section\u2019s title represents Chalmers\u2019 paper\u2019s main question. Note that it requires the assumption that consciousness is material (Physicalism Assumption), a point some scholars dispute (see Goff, 2007; Lowe, 2006). Chalmers (1995) aswers the question with the&nbsp;<i>Principle of Organisational Invariance (POI)</i>:</p><p><br><i>POI: \u201cGiven a system with conscious experiences, any system with the same functional organisation at a fine enough grain will have qualitatively identical conscious experiences.\u201d</i></p><p><br>By functional organisation, Chalmers means the dependence relations and causal interactions between the system\u2019s components (e.g. the particular network connections between neurons in a brain). Furthermore, \u2018fine enough grain\u2019 means something like \u2018sufficiently informative level of analysis\u2019, indicating that Chalmers will focus on analysing consciousness at the neuronal level.&nbsp;</p><p>A key aspect of POI is the&nbsp;<i>multiple realisability&nbsp;</i>of consciousness: in the same way that by playing the right notes I perform Bach\u2019s Goldberg\u2019s Variations irrespective of what my specific instrument is, consciousness can be realised in various physical systems (brains, silicon chips, alien organisms\u2026) if the right functional organisation is replicated. However, this assumption is contested by various theories which tie qualia to specific physical properties that I will now evaluate.&nbsp;</p><p>Firstly, some theorists argue that qualia are inherently tied to biochemical properties. For instance, mind-brain type identity theorists claim that qualia are identical to brain processes (Polger, 2011) in the same way that ocean waves are identical to movements of water particles. A related but weaker proposal consists in the scientific search for specific patterns of brain activity tied to consciousness, labeled as Neural Correlates of Consciousness (NCCs) and defined as the \u201c<i>minimal</i> and&nbsp;<i>sufficient</i> neural system N whose activation leads to a conscious percept\u201d (Chalmers, 2000, p. 31). Secondly, others argue that qualia arise out of quantum-mechanical properties. Penrose &amp; Hammeroff (2014) suggest that rather than being a result of synaptic interactions, consciousness is produced by synchronised quantum computations in the neuron\u2019s microtubules, i.e. supporting structures in the neuronal cell.&nbsp;</p><p>All in all, Chalmers sets out to defend POI against the theories outlined above. Therefore, we can formulate his first main thesis:&nbsp;</p><p><br><i>CT<sub>1</sub>: POI is the correct view of how qualia depend on physical properties.</i></p><p><br>In Section 1.3, I will describe objections to CT<sub>1</sub>, how Chalmers aims to respond to them and how the success of CT<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>bears on the possibility of Artificial Consciousness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>1.3 Objections to POI and Artificial Consciousness</h3><p>Opponents of POI often invoke \u2018Absent Qualia\u2019 counter-examples with the following steps:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Describe a functional organisation that is taken as sufficient to produce consciousness.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Construct a counter-intuitive example which fits the description.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Conclude that since the example is unlikely to be conscious, there must be something else involved in creating consciousness other than mere functional organisation.&nbsp;</p><p>The most important argumentative Step 2 usually involves constructing the human brain\u2019s functional organisation in very counter-intuitive ways. This could be a network of strings mimicking neural activity, Block\u2019s (1978) China brain experiment or Searle\u2019s (1980) water pipe network. Since it seems absurd to contend that these would be conscious, then there must be more to consciousness than just functional organisation.</p><p>Here, the main mechanics of Chalmers\u2019 argument come into play: he takes Absent Qualia to be the&nbsp;<i>main&nbsp;</i>objection against&nbsp;<i>CT<sub>1</sub>.&nbsp;</i>Thus, if he can prove that Absent Qualia are wrong, he can infer as the best explanation that&nbsp;<i>CT<sub>1&nbsp; </sub>is&nbsp;</i>correct. Hence, Chalmers\u2019 second main thesis is to argue against the empirical possibility of Absent Qualia through his Fading Qualia argument (see Section 2):</p><p><br><i>CT<sub>2</sub>: Absent qualia are empirically impossible.</i></p><p><br>Furthermore, note that Absent Qualia cases have a significant bearing on another debate: the possibility of Artificial Consciousness (AC), i.e. whether complex artificial systems such as Large Language Models (LLMs), Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents or others can instantiate qualitatively identical qualia to humans or non-human animals (Seth,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://users.sussex.ac.uk/~anils/Papers/SethIJMC2009.pdf\"><u>2009</u></a>). If we believe that Absent Qualia are empirically impossible, then it is also possible that AIs fall into the set of functionally equivalent yet qualia-lacking systems. On the other hand, if one believes that Absent Qualia are empirically impossible, then there seems to be little reason to suppose that sufficiently functionally equivalent AIs could not be conscious. Hence, one\u2019s credence in the possibility of AC should rise and fall with one\u2019s credence in the possibility of Absent Qualia. Therefore, as a consequence of&nbsp;<i>CT<sub>2</sub></i>, Chalmers commits to a third central thesis:</p><p><br><i>CT<sub>3</sub>: Artificial Consciousness is empirically possible.&nbsp;</i></p><p><br>Interestingly, some authors even claim that Chalmers\u2019 arguments are the only arguments in the philosophical literature which explicitly argue for the possibility of AC (Long, 2022). Thus, it is important to see how successful they are.</p><p>Having summarised the wider debate surrounding Chalmers\u2019 arguments and some preliminary assumptions and argumentative steps he makes, Section 2 will present Fading Qualia in detail. Then, in Section 3, I will start developing my objections to Fading Qualia.</p><h2><br>2. Fading Qualia</h2><p>Fading Qualia is a&nbsp;<i>reductio ad absurdum</i>, i.e. an argumentative mode which refutes a supposition by showing it leads to absurd consequences (Rescher, 2023):&nbsp;</p><p><strong>P1&nbsp;</strong>Suppose Absent Qualia are empirically possible.</p><p><strong>C1&nbsp;</strong>There can be a system (<strong>\u0160ilicon</strong>) with the same functional organization as a conscious system (<strong>\u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n</strong>) which lacks conscious properties (due to differences in non-organizational properties such as substrate).</p><p><strong>P2</strong> Suppose we gradually replace&nbsp;<strong>\u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n\u2019s</strong> neurons with&nbsp;<strong>\u0160ilicon\u2019s</strong> silicon chips, preserving the organizational structure.</p><p><strong>P3&nbsp;</strong>On the final step of the replacement process,&nbsp;<strong>\u0160ilicon</strong>, by hypothesis, has no experiences, while&nbsp;<strong>\u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n&nbsp;</strong>did<strong>&nbsp;</strong>at the beginning.</p><p><strong>C2&nbsp;</strong>This means that at some point during the replacement process, qualia either gradually faded (<i>Fading Qualia)&nbsp;</i>or suddenly disappeared (<i>Suddenly Disappearing Qualia).</i></p><p><strong>P4&nbsp;</strong>Both options are implausible.</p><p><strong>C3&nbsp;</strong>P1 is incorrect.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>CT<sub>1</sub></strong> POI is the correct view of how qualia depend on physical properties.&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;<i>Fading Qualia&nbsp;</i>scenario holds that the conscious system\u2019s qualia start gradually fading. Chalmers claims that this cannot be true because it entails too strong a dissociation between cognition and consciousness: it would require that partially replaced system says all the things that&nbsp;<strong>\u0160t\u011bp\u00e1n</strong> would say (because they have the same functional organisation, including outputs), but it is wrong about everything it says since its qualia are, by hypothesis, fading (so, for instance it says \u201cI am seeing bright red\u201d, when in fact it sees faded pink). Chalmers dismisses this as too implausible.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;<i>Suddenly Disappearing Qualia&nbsp;</i>scenario holds that the conscious system\u2019s qualia suddenly switch off. Chalmers claims that this is absurd because it suggests a strange discontinuity in the laws of nature: it would mean that we could switch back and forth between a neuron and its silicon replacement with a field of experience blinking in and out.&nbsp;</p><p>Hence, Chalmers concludes that the impossibility of Absent Qualia is best explained by POI being correct, through the indirect reasoning mentioned in Section 1.3.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, I will move on to my criticisms of Fading Qualia, highlighting first that P2 is question-begging.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>3. Critique of Fading Qualia&nbsp;</h2><h3>3.1 P2 is question-begging</h3><p>It seems that P2 introduces an element of \u2018question-beggingness\u2019 into Fading Qualia. Namely, it seems that Chalmers must assume the following for P2 to hold: neurons and silicon chips are interchangeable systems if they produce the right structure of inputs and outputs. Without this assumption, the replacement scenario would be impossible. However, the assumption just seems to be a variation of POI where \u2018system with conscious experiences\u2019 is replaced by \u2018information processing system\u2019 or whatever one takes to be the umbrella term for neurons and silicon chips and \u2018have identical conscious experiences\u2019 is replaced with \u2018produce identical conscious experiences\u2019. In other words, the argument is question-begging because it assumes its own conclusion (POI) at the finer organisational level of neurons and silicon chips. This seems problematic since Chalmers intends his argument to have persuasive force over other theories of consciousness.&nbsp;</p><p>Perhaps it could be argued that it is wrong to categorise this observation as \u2018question-begging\u2019, since there is no obvious reason to contest the interchangeability of neurons and silicon chips (or artificial neurons). However, Section 3 will now present the&nbsp;<i>Biology Argument&nbsp;</i>which contests their interchangeability and acts as a counter-argument to Fading Qualia.&nbsp;</p><h3><br>3.2 Biology Argument&nbsp;</h3><p>Section 3.2.1 proposes the&nbsp;<i>Biology Argument</i> as a counter-argument to Fading Qualia. Then, in Section 3.2.2 I will provide justification for P2 of the&nbsp;<i>Biology Argument</i>. Finally, in Section 3.2.3 I will argue that since the&nbsp;<i>Biology Argument&nbsp;</i>is justified, it provides direct reasons to reject both CT<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>and CT<sub>1</sub>.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.2.1 General Structure of the Biology Argument</p><p><strong>P1</strong> Fading Qualia is true iff neurons and silicon chips are interchangeable.</p><p><strong>P2</strong> Neurons and silicon chips are not interchangeable.</p><p><strong>C1</strong> Fading Qualia is wrong.&nbsp;</p><p>P2 clearly does most of the argumentative heavy lifting and requires the most support. I will use Godfrey-Smith\u2019s (2016) arguments for the connection between metabolism and consciousness to justify P2 in Section 3.1.2. The rest of the argument is just a simple modus tollens.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.2.2 Godfrey-Smith\u2019s justification for P2</p><p>P2 can be justified with Godfrey-Smith\u2019s claim that biological cells responsible for consciousness possess&nbsp;<i>metabolic&nbsp;</i>properties differentiating them from other processing units such as silicon chips. Metabolism is defined by Godfrey-Smith (2016) as \u201ca system\u2019s maintenance of organisation in the face of thermodynamic tendencies towards disorder and decay [\u2026] through chemical reactions.\u201d This is the full-fledged justification (call it the&nbsp;<i>Metabolism Justification</i>):&nbsp;</p><p><br><strong>P1</strong> The right structure of inputs and outputs for consciousness depends on fine-grained metabolic processes..</p><p><strong>P2</strong> Silicon chips cannot support these fine-grained functional processes.</p><p><strong>C1</strong> Neurons and silicon chips are not interchangeable.</p><p><br>P1 is supported by Godfrey-Smith\u2019s main example of the nitric oxide molecule, which is crucial for both (i) consciousness-producing processes such as plasticity at neural synapses, i.e. the changes in the brain\u2019s structure in response to stimuli, and (ii) metabolism, through its role in the proper functioning of blood vessels and glial cells. Another supporting example is neuronal plasticity itself, however, for lack of space it cannot be described here.</p><p>P2 highlights the special status of metabolic processes. They happen at a specifically small scale (nanometers) and in a particularly complex context (immersed in water with hundreds of molecules involved), resulting in trillions of molecular interactions every second. Thus, to fight this thermodynamically chaotic setting and maximise the preservation of energy, many fine-grained processes such as micro-computational activities within cells, signal-like interactions between cells or self-maintenance and control of boundaries evolved. Hence, consciousness as it evolved from these metabolic and proto-cognitive processes can be conceptualised as a \u2018binding force\u2019 integrating them all together. In contrast, Godfrey-Smith argues that since computers are in a more orderly setting and are less energy constrained, it is unlikely that the \u2018classical candidates\u2019 for replication such as silicon could actually model these processes. Hence, they lack the necessary properties that play the right role in producing consciousness (C1). A similar conclusion is reached by Thagard (2022), who argues that the significantly different energy requirements faced by biological and silicon systems are largely overlooked by philosophical arguments such as Fading Qualia.</p><p>If the&nbsp;<i>Metabolism Justification&nbsp;</i>is true, then it seems that the&nbsp;<i>Biology Argument&nbsp;</i>is also true. Let us evaluate what this means for Fading Qualia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3.2.3 Upshot of the Biology Argument</p><p>C2 alone does not directly prove that POI is wrong, as Godfrey-Smith asserts that neurons and silicon chips&nbsp;<i>cannot&nbsp;</i>be functional equivalents due to differences explained above. This means that POI could still be valid with appropriate substrates.&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>However, the&nbsp;<i>Biology Argument&nbsp;</i>does<i>&nbsp;</i>successfully show that Fading Qualia rests on an unwarranted assumption, meaning it does not go through. Hence, through similar indirect reasoning to Chalmers\u2019, we can assert that CT<sub>2&nbsp;</sub>is wrong: since a purported objection against Absent Qualia does not follow, it seems that Absent Qualia are empirically possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, I think the&nbsp;<i>Biology Argument</i> proves that CT<sub>1</sub> is wrong through appealing to POI\u2019s triviality. POI can be argued to be trivial for the following reason: it argues that systems with the same functional organisation will have identical conscious experiences, however, based on the above, the sufficient functional organisation can most likely only be achieved by biological brains. Therefore, POI amounts to saying something like: \u2018two creatures with identically structured brains (in an identical state) will have identical conscious experiences\u2019, which is trivial if paired with accepting the Physicalist Assumption<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2o18iweptgw\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2o18iweptgw\">[1]</a></sup></span>. This charge of triviality means that POI loses much of its explanatory power when compared to its rival theories \u2014 mind-brain identity theorists or NCC theorists at least propose concrete laws guiding the interactions of qualia and physical processes (e.g. tying them to concrete brain areas). As such, it seems that CT<sub>1&nbsp;</sub>is wrong: if the&nbsp;<i>Biology Argument</i> is correct, then there are more accurate and better views of how qualia depend on physical properties than POI.&nbsp;</p><p>Before this can be concluded with confidence, it is necessary to consider objections to the&nbsp;<i>Biology Argument.&nbsp;</i>I consider three objections: Section 3.2.1 questions the&nbsp;<i>Metabolism Justification\u2019s&nbsp;</i>strength<i>.&nbsp;</i>Section 3.2.2 points to instances of purported neural replacement to the&nbsp;<i>Biology Argument\u2019s&nbsp;</i>P2. Finally, Section 3.2.3 proposes a counter-example to my arguments. Refuting all three, I conclude with&nbsp;<i>M1.&nbsp;</i></p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>3.3 Objections&nbsp;</h3><p>3.3.1 Metabolism Justification is Weakly Justified</p><p>The first objection may be that the&nbsp;<i>Metabolism Justification</i> is insufficiently supported. More specifically, why should one believe that activities of nitric oxide or thermodynamic chaos are really unreplicable by a strong enough computer? Without&nbsp;<u>defending</u> this crux, the argument seems very weak.&nbsp;</p><p>I will now defend the Metabolism Justification against this charge. Let us assume for the sake of argument that silicon chips&nbsp;<i>are&nbsp;</i>functionally equivalent with biological cells. As a result, the following case must be true since the equivalence posited by POI is symmetrical (the identity relation must go both ways): a human should be able to execute all of their metabolic functions, behaviour, cognition etc. using only Python-like commands (or any other programming language). In other words, if a computer can support human-like consciousness, then a human must be able to support a computer-like consciousness. However, it seems unclear to me how one could even begin to conceptualise this \u2014 for instance, how could a person experience pain as a line of Python code? It simply seems that biology is not fit to implement this sort of functioning, in the same way that a computer will not be able to adopt metabolic functioning, supporting the irreplicability of metabolism in silicon.</p><p>Of course, this analogy has its limitations: it may be argued that there is a mismatch in levels of analysis between the cases, whereby the chemistry orchestrating the body is a \u2018lower-level\u2019 phenomenon than code is for computers. Still, the analogy seems to support the more general principle that a system\u2019s functioning is strongly tied to what purposes and under what pressures that functioning exists. Thus, since I believe that Godfrey-Smith convincingly demonstrated that cells and silicon chips are subject to very different requirements and pressures, his argument has strength.&nbsp;</p><p><br>3.3.2 Attack on the Biology Argument\u2019s P2&nbsp;</p><p>Another objection challenges P2 with purported instances of neural activity replicated in silicon, examples including prosthetic limbs or bioelectrical therapeutic devices. Since e.g. prosthetic arms seem to function in a very similar way to regular arms, this could be taken as evidence that biological neurons are&nbsp;<i>in fact&nbsp;</i>replaceable with silicon ones.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though this response seems initially strong, holding that biological and artificial neurons are interchangeable and thereby functionally equivalent actually defeats POI. This is because it does not seem that prosthetic devices instantiate any qualia \u2014 for instance, hitting a prosthetic arm does not cause pain&nbsp;<i>in the prosthetic arm</i> but rather residual limb pain and potentially phantom pain in the biological limb (Morgan et al., 2017). And while the case of phantom pain is still understudied and complex, it is by and large a case of residual signals in the biological arm rather than pain in the artificial arm (Browne et al., 2022; Garcia-Pallero et al., 2022). This would seem to show that there is more to qualia than mere functionality. Alternatively, the defender may hold that in these cases, biological and artificial body parts are functionally equivalent on a&nbsp;<i>coarse-grained</i> level since they clearly contribute to behaviour in similar ways, demonstrating their interchangeability. However, this merely sends us back to the&nbsp;<i>Biology Argument\u2019s&nbsp;</i>familiar reasoning<i>,&nbsp;</i>whereby fine-grained processes matter to consciousness, meaning the defender must come up with a new argument as to how these could be replicated in silicon or with an argument that contests the role of metabolism in constituting consciousness. Hence, overall, it does not seem that this reply works either.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><br>3.3.3 Digital Simulations</p><p>A final objection invokes digital simulations of the mind as counter-examples (Bostrom &amp; Shulman, 2022). These can be illustrated by imagining how one can simulate the flight of a bird. Perhaps one could build a synthetic bird \u2014 simply replace all organic features with artificial ones and by the end, one should have a flying artificial replica of a bird. Alternatively, one could attempt to build a digital flight simulator \u2014 combine all mathematical descriptions of wing dynamics, airflow, trajectory etc. into a single algorithm and, once run, achieve a successful replication of bird flight as well. Similarly, it may be said that the same must also hold for a perfect mathematical simulation of the brain (say, one that includes a detailed mathematical description of all metabolic processes) \u2014 it should count as a successful replication of consciousness, reviving POI (rather than substrate) as the key to consciousness (Bostrom &amp; Shulman, 2022). I think that even if the above is true, it has little bearing on how the Biology Argument and Fading Qualia fare.&nbsp;</p><p>This is because the Digital Simulations argument does not really address any of the present arguments\u2019 premises, which are framed in terms of neurons vs silicon chips. Furthermore, it seems difficult to imagine a replacement scenario whereby one is gradually uploaded into a computer \u2014 the replacement intuition pump loses even more appeal<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref94eb38dn22i\"><sup><a href=\"#fn94eb38dn22i\">[2]</a></sup></span>. As such, I think digital simulations should be treated as a&nbsp;<i>separate</i> argument in favour of POI rather than a counter-argument to my position.</p><p>Having defended the Biology Argument against objections, it can be concluded that:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>M1: The Fading Qualia argument is wrong.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I will now discuss what bearing this has on the plausibility of AC.&nbsp;</p><h2>&nbsp;</h2><h2>4. Another Upshot: Artificial Consciousness</h2><p>As discussed, Fading Qualia has significant bearing on AC for many reasons: (i)&nbsp;<i>CT<sub>1</sub></i> supports the notion of&nbsp;<i>multiply realisable&nbsp;</i>consciousness through POI, (ii)&nbsp;<i>CT<sub>2</sub></i> attempts to dismantle the main objection against AC (Absent Qualia) and (iii) it is perhaps the only argument in the philosophical literature which explicitly supports AC. Therefore, since the&nbsp;<i>Biology Argument&nbsp;</i>contests the central theses by highlighting the argument\u2019s question-begging and unsupported nature, it seems that all three reasons for supporting AC fall. That should certainly lower our credence in AC\u2019s empirical possibility.</p><p>Furthermore, the&nbsp;<i>Biology Argument&nbsp;</i>acts as a standalone argument against AC\u2019s posibility. Firstly, it<i>&nbsp;</i>places the burden of proof on proponents of AC: they need to argue that (i) metabolic processes are replicable in silicon or (ii) metabolism does not contribute to consciousness. Without these arguments, there are strong reasons to believe that consciousness is tied to the biological substrate. Secondly, the biological arguments present consciousness as functionally tied to particular thermodynamic processes in the body (as the \u201cbinding force\u201d). Hence, given the disparity in energy requirements and pressures facing living systems and current (silicon-based!) AI systems (see Thagard as well), it seems unlikely that consciousness needs to emerge in the systems that we are currently building. Granted, LLMs\u2019 neurons or the learning of RL systems display some brain-like or human-like functioning. However, precisely because of the progress that AIs make on many of these metrics (e.g. the progress in LLMs\u2019 language recognition and production capabilities, see Roser,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/brief-history-of-ai\"><u>2023</u></a>), it seems that they are entirely dissociable from consciousness<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefw5w09i7m7d\"><sup><a href=\"#fnw5w09i7m7d\">[3]</a></sup></span>. In other words, these systems need not develop consciousness in order to improve their performance on such metrics. Therefore, it is unlikely that (i) researchers will actively try to build consciousness into their systems or (ii) it will spontaneously emerge. This seems to further reinforce the point that consciousness in these systems is relatively unlikely.</p><p>For all the reasons above, I think we should conclude that:</p><p><br><i>M2: We should lower our credence in the empirical possibility of Artificial Consciousness.&nbsp;</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I frame the conclusion in terms of credence rather than claiming AC is impossible because there are separate arguments that may uphold AC, for instance, the digital simulations of the mind mentioned above. Another argument could be the&nbsp;<i>evolutionary argument&nbsp;</i>(see a variation in Chalmers, 2010), claiming that since evolution managed to produce consciousness, humans could achieve building it too. As such, M2 should be carefully read as contesting the empirical possibility of AC in current and future silicon-based systems or any other substrates which are unable to replicate biological metabolic processes.</p><p>Furthermore, throughout the paper it has been assumed that AC involves an instantiation of qualitatively identical qualia to humans or non-human animals. Of course, it is plausible that future AIs may possess consciousness with entirely different qualitative properties. However, due to the speculative and underexplored nature of this consideration, I am hesitant to contend that this should increase our credence in AC.</p><p>Finally, note that for reasons described above, M2 runs parallel to whether advanced AI systems could pose significant risks to humanity. Consciousness is sometimes taken to be synonymous with \u2018intelligence\u2019 or \u2018awareness of self\u2019 which for some might be key ingredients to a catastrophic outcome from AI \u2014 for instance, a superintelligent AI with self-serving goals. However, as noted in Section 1.1, consciousness here has a different meaning, namely, the phenomenal character of subjective experiences. Since it was argued that many coarse-grained functions encompassed by the term \u2018intelligence\u2019 can be executed without the presence of qualia, arguments for or against risks from advanced AI are largely separate from arguments about digital sentience.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>5. Final Upshot: Ethical Implications</h2><p>M2 has a significant bearing on the ethical debate surrounding advanced AI systems and whether they could earn a moral status in the future (be that&nbsp;<i>agency</i> or perhaps&nbsp;<i>patienthood</i>). That is, if AIs possess qualia, this means they may be experiencing subjectively positive feelings such as pleasure and subjectively negative feelings such as pain, affording them interests. This, in turn, may warrant their inclusion in our moral circle, meaning broadly we should make efforts to take AIs\u2019 interests into account and promote their well-being. Hence, the prospect of AC seems to require the attention of ethics<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefbkdq8cv3vio\"><sup><a href=\"#fnbkdq8cv3vio\">[4]</a></sup></span>. This is also because the expected value of digitally conscious lives could be very significant (Akova, 2023) \u2014 since large numbers of future AIs are likely to be created and these systems may eventually even self-replicate in enormous numbers, the potential that all of these beings are actually suffering would constitute a moral catastrophe. This even led some philosophers to argue that research with the goal of creating AC is morally impermissible (Basl, 2013). Hence, the existence of AC seems to have significant moral consequences and could alter many of our current practices.&nbsp;</p><p>In contrast to the above, M1 and M2 seem to imply that the expected value of conscious AI lives may not be that large, since AC at least in our current architectures is not very probable. This seems to suggest that a good deal of commercially built AIs will not fall into the moral circle. Instead, the circle will include only systems which are specifically engineered to possess consciousness. This, again, is not to say that this issue is ethically irrelevant since there are other potential pathways to AC already mentioned. However, it seems to make the issue less pressing, since technologies like whole brain emulation (WBE) seem to face a number of unsolved technical issues (Sandberg, 2013). More generally, assuming my arguments above are true or at least plausible, it seems that the estimate of AC lives\u2019 expected value largely hinges on one\u2019s credence in (i) WBE and other \u201cconsciousness engineering techniques\u201d and/or (ii) scenarios where a qualitatively different subjective experience (that could still at least roughly correspond to pleasure and pain) spontaneously emerges in AIs. Since both scenarios seem relatively unlikely to obtain as of now, this may lower the moral significance of AC when compared to other ethical issues. That being said, this issue deserves more detailed treatment in a paper of its own.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>6. Conclusion&nbsp;</h2><p>Chalmers\u2019 Fading Qualia advocates three main claims:<br>&nbsp;</p><p><i>CT<sub>1</sub>: Principle of Organisational Invariance is a correct view of how qualia depend on physical properties.</i><br>&nbsp;</p><p><i>CT<sub>2</sub>: Absent qualia are empirically impossible.</i><br>&nbsp;</p><p><i>CT<sub>3</sub>: Artificial Consciousness is empirically possible.&nbsp;</i></p><p><br>I have argued that Fading Qualia cannot support these conclusions because it is question-begging: it assumes POI at the level of neurons and silicon chips in its initial premises. This assumption\u2019s unwarranted nature was supported by the Biology Argument, highlighting the unique nature of neurons and their metabolic processes, making them the primary substrate for consciousness. This means that&nbsp;<i>CT<sub>2</sub></i><sub>&nbsp; </sub>does not follow and&nbsp;<i>CT<sub>1&nbsp; </sub></i>is wrong on grounds of triviality. Finally, having discussed objections to my argument, I have concluded that we should lower our credence in&nbsp;<i>CT<sub>3</sub></i>, as our current and future silicon-based AI systems are unlikely to develop consciousness due to functional differences. This has further ethical implications, potentially lowering the likelihood that AIs will earn moral status in the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>References</strong><br>&nbsp;</h3><p>Akova, F., 2023.

Our mission is to&nbsp;<strong>spread ideas</strong> that elucidate the promise of biology,&nbsp;<strong>take its concomitant risks seriously</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>direct talent</strong> toward solving pressing problems.</p><p>Our published work has three features that I want to highlight here: Pieces will steel-man alternative approaches, focus on high-impact but often underrated facets of biotechnology, and strive for mechanistic and probabilistic reasoning.</p><p><strong>Steelman:</strong> Biotechnology is not a panacea. Simple solutions are often the best solutions; no engineering required. When Ignaz Semmelweis suggested that doctors at an Austrian Hospital wash their hands between performing autopsies and delivering babies, the maternal mortality rate fell from around 25 percent&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3881728/\"><u>to 1 percent</u></a>. In another example, a public health campaign to iodize salt in Switzerland helped bring down the rate of deaf-mute births&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v45/n23/jonah-goodman/a-national-evil\"><u>fivefold in just 8 years</u></a>. Rather than demand answers from biotechnology, we can often make a positive difference in the world by investing in better public health, improving infrastructure and education, or scaling up existing inventions that have already proven effective.</p><p>Even so, simplicity can feel unsatisfactory or even provocative. Semmelweis, considered arrogant by senior doctors, was ostracized and eventually dismissed from his post. An early pioneer in germ theory, he&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2020/03/23/ignaz-semmelweis-handwashing-coronavirus/\"><u>died in a Viennese insane asylum</u></a>, after being severely beaten by guards. In Switzerland, although evidence for the efficacy of iodized salt was robust, some eminent scientists spoke out against the interventions\u2014advocating for elaborate alternative treatments. We\u2019ll do our best to avoid publishing work that we&nbsp;<i>wish</i> were true, and instead aim to provide balanced, honest, and rigorous coverage of biotechnology.</p><p><strong>High-impact solutions:</strong> Progress often makes its greatest strides in areas that are not widely covered by the media. We will de-emphasize medical topics and focus instead on areas such as animal welfare and climate resiliency, where biotechnology has proven astonishingly effective yet remains underexplored. We want people to focus on what is most urgent and tractable, and not necessarily on what is most glamorous.&nbsp;</p><p>Laundry is one example. Engineered enzymes that remove stains in cold water reduced the energy required to do laundry by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cleaninginstitute.org/industry-priorities/outreach/cold-water-saves\"><u>about 90 percent</u></a>. Laundry may not be as immediately headline-grabbing as new cancer therapies, but it provides a concrete and ingenious solution to a demonstrable need.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mechanisms:</strong>&nbsp;Biotechnology shouldn\u2019t be a mystery. Although its mechanisms are often infinitesimal, biology is&nbsp;<i>material&nbsp;</i>rather than magic. Cells are made from collections of atoms that we can manipulate, visualize, and control. Every engineering application has a mechanistic and tangible explanation. Often, these explanations are astonishingly beautiful. We encourage our writers to delve deeper and elucidate complex concepts in clear, illustrative prose.</p><p><i>Asimov Press&nbsp;</i>will publish one feature article every two weeks, with additional newsletters and shorter essays scattered in between. Articles will be bundled into a magazine every three months, and each magazine will have a themed section with additional pieces that have not been published before.&nbsp;</p><p>Learn more about our article types and how to write for us by perusing the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://press.asimov.com/resources/pitch-guide\"><u>Pitch Guide</u></a>.

It is primarily based on intuition, not thorough research and surveys.</i></p><p>It is not news that <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gLJBfruDrKQDkbf2b/racial-and-gender-demographics-at-ea-global-in-2022-1\">the EA community has an unbalanced demographic</a>, with men in the majority.</p><p>I have heard from several women what they dislike about the EA community and this post is what I have taken from those conversations. I think that if we can move more in the direction I'm describing, the EA community can become warmer and more welcoming to all genders and races (and also more effective at doing good).</p><p><i>I'd like to note that I don't think what I'm about to describe is a widespread problem, but a phenomenon that may occur in some places. Most of my experiences with the EA community have been very positive. I meet mostly caring people with whom I can have interesting, sometimes controversial discussions. And I often meet people who are very willing to help.</i></p><p>Now to the subject:</p><p>Some women I have spoken to have described a \"lack of empathy\" in the group, or, more specifically, that EA people came across as \"tech bros\" who lacked humility and wouldn't help a stranger because it wouldn't be the most effective thing to do. In an introductory discussion group we ran (in our university group), one of the participants perceived some of EA's ideas as \"cold-hearted\" and was very critical of the abstract, sometimes detached way of trying to calculate how to do good most effectively.</p><p>I believe that these impressions and experiences point to risks associated with certain EA-related ideas.</p><h1>The idea of optimization</h1><p>Firstly, the idea of optimising/maximising one's impact is fraught with risks, which have been described already <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cDv9mP5Yoz4k4fSbW/don-t-over-optimize-things\">here</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/yJBhuCjqvJyd7kW7a/perils-of-optimizing-in-social-contexts\">here</a> and <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/T975ydo3mx8onH3iS/ea-is-about-maximization-and-maximization-is-perilous\">here</a> (and maybe elsewhere, too).&nbsp;</p><p>To judge between actions or causes as more or less worthy of our attention can certainly seem cold-hearted. While this approach is valuable for triage and for prioritising in difficult situations, it also has a dark side when it justifies not caring about what we might normally care about. We should not discredit what might be judged as lesser goods just because some metric suggests it. It shouldn't lead us to lose our humility (impacts are uncertain and we are not omniscient) as well as our sense of caring.</p><p>What kind of community are we if people don't feel comfortable talking about their private lives because they don't optimise everything, don't spend their free time researching or trying to make a difference? When people think that spending time volunteering for less effective non-profits might not be valued or even dismissed? What is the point of an ineffective soup kitchen, after all it is a waste of time in terms of improving QALYs?</p><p>I have no doubt that even the thought of encountering such insensitive comments makes you feel uncomfortable.</p><p>The following quote might appear to conflict with the goal of EA, but I think it doesn't and makes and important point.</p><p>\u201cThere is no hierarchy of compassionate action. Based on our interests, skills and what truly moves us, we each find our own way, helping to alleviate suffering in whatever way we can.\u201d <i>-&nbsp;</i>Joseph Goldstein (2007) in<i> A Heart Full of Peace&nbsp;</i></p><p>What we are trying to do is called Effective Altruism, not Altruistic Effectiveness, and we should be trying to be altruistic in the first place, that is, good and caring people.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefe5afx057acq\"><sup><a href=\"#fne5afx057acq\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><h1>The idea of focusing on consequences</h1><p>I also think that an exaggerated focus on consequences can be misleading in a social context, as well as detrimental in terms of personal well-being. Even if one supports consequentialism, focusing on consequences may not be the best strategy for achieving them.</p><p>One reason is that, as Stoic philosophy tells us, we can't control the outcomes of our actions.</p><p>Another is that if we cling to them, they can distract us from what it means to live an ethical life. When we focus on consequences rather than valuing effort and intention, what it means to be a good person is subject to considerable moral luck.</p><p>I think this focus on consequences, which is widespread in EA, can also lead to unhealthy social dynamics. One might be tempted to value effectiveness over kindness, intelligence over caring. I have heard some people say something like \"well, I am not that impactful\", with a painful touch of imposter syndrome, comparing themselves to other people who have done more impressive things within the EA movement.</p><p>Even when we try to see each other as a team working towards a common goal of making the world a better place, we often can't help but form opinions of other people by judging them based on what we value. We are animals who play status games, even when we may not like the idea. So our shared values, what we care about, are important to our community. And I think that these ideas, effectiveness and a focus on consequences, if overly endorsed, can make a community less welcoming and less warm-hearted. This starts with whether we frame and explain EA in the abstract as \"trying to do good as effectively as possible\" or as \"trying to help people and animals as well as we can\", and ends with the values we consider most important.</p><h1>Conclusions</h1><p>In conclusion, I think that rather than being overly focused on finding the most effective means of doing good, we should also be concerned with becoming more altruistic, caring and compassionate. We should not neglect to care about things that are difficult or impossible to measure by focusing on reason and rationality. We must remain humble, grounded and warm-hearted. Even when dealing with important technical issues such as AI safety or other areas of long-term concern (and especially in those cases), it is important to nurture human qualities and not allow them to recede into the background. I'm not trying to devalue these causes, but they might become an easy way to rationalise away and disconnect from the suffering that is happening right now. Because it can be painful to open up to and connect with suffering, it can be tempting to find a good reason not to.</p><p>EA isn't about turning off the heart because it might lead to bias, it's about turning on the head. And when they are in conflict, we need to stop and think carefully about what price we might pay in trying to be as effective as possible. Good and caring actions that may seem ineffective can be very important for reasons that we cannot put into a metric.</p><p>We can and should learn not only how to think more rationally, but also how to become more caring, for compassion is a skill we can train. This quality of caring, the intention to help, is the soil on which EA can grow. It is linked to our personal and interpersonal well-being and we should emphasise the importance of nurturing it rather than depleting it by becoming too attached to certain ideas.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefdeqzbn1oe0g\"><sup><a href=\"#fndeqzbn1oe0g\">[2]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnxgmn1l0yfk\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnxgmn1l0yfk\">[3]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref58fe7p6n0p3\"><sup><a href=\"#fn58fe7p6n0p3\">[4]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0plww51mgwdh\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0plww51mgwdh\">[5]</a></sup></span></p><h3>A few resources on practicing compassion&nbsp;</h3><ul><li>Practicing mindfulness (A wandering mind is a less caring mind<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5o8yvmo0a64\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5o8yvmo0a64\">[6]</a></sup></span>)</li><li>Practicing to care (e.g. through loving-kindness meditation)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefni7kllnhfw\"><sup><a href=\"#fnni7kllnhfw\">[7]</a></sup></span><span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefb2l7iisklrq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnb2l7iisklrq\">[8]</a></sup></span></li><li>There are other resources available, such as from <a href=\"https://ccare.stanford.edu/\">the CCARE at Stanford</a></li></ul><h1>&nbsp;References and acknowledgements</h1><p><i>I like to thank Ysa Bourgine for her reflections and ideas that contributed to this post and everyone else with whom I had good conversations about these topics.</i></p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fne5afx057acq\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefe5afx057acq\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>I took this expression from Emil Wasteson</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fndeqzbn1oe0g\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefdeqzbn1oe0g\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Jazaieri H, Jinpa GT, McGonigal K, et al.

However, there are likely similar actions people from other countries can take. If you know of ways people outside the U.S. can help, please write them in the comments.&nbsp;</p><p>I cover working to stop the deaths of innocent civilians in Palestine, working to get Israeli hostages released, and improving the humanitarian conditions in Palestine. At the end of this post, I included tips on how to effectively reach U.S. politicians, and a summary of the things you can do to help people in Palestine and Israel.&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Stopping and reducing the deaths of civilians in Palestine&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></h1><h2><strong>The situation</strong></h2><p>In their efforts to defeat Hamas, the Israeli government is dropping bombs and leading ground attacks that have killed over&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/how-many-palestinians-have-died-gaza-war-how-will-counting-continue-2023-12-06/\"><u>17,000 Palestinians</u></a> and over&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hrw.org/news/2023/11/22/israel/gaza-hostilities-take-horrific-toll-children\"><u>5,000 children</u></a>. There is no safe place in Gaza, and Palestinians are not allowed to leave Gaza. <u>After Israel told civilians to move to the south, </u><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2023/12/05/world/middleeast/gaza-60-days.html\"><u>it continued to strike there too</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>More children have been killed in Gaza in the past 2.5 months than the 2,985 children killed in <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/18/world/middleeast/gaza-children-israel.html\">all the world's major conflict zones combined</a> last year. Casualty and weapons experts say <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/25/world/middleeast/israel-gaza-death-toll.html\">people are being killed in Gaza more quickly than the deadliest moments of U.S.-led attacks in Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan</a>, which were themselves widely criticized by human rights groups. &nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How to help</strong></h2><p>The current Israeli administration\u2019s approach to the war is killing thousands of innocent civilians and children. For people outside Israel, the most effective way to influence the actions of the Israeli government is through political pressure from your own country\u2019s government. I\u2019ll focus on the United States. However, if you live in another country, it would help to pressure your politicians as well. &nbsp;</p><p>The U.S. government has close ties to Israel and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.axios.com/2023/11/04/us-israel-aid-military-funding-chart\"><u>gives around $3.3 billion dollars of aid to Israel each year</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The United States has influence over Israel.

Unfortunately, my disagreements are all over the place. It's not that I disagree with one or two key points: there are many elements of the standard argument that I diverge from, and depending on the audience, I don't know which points of disagreement people think are most important.</p><p>I want to write a post highlighting all the important areas where I disagree, and offering my own counterarguments as an alternative. This post would benefit from responding to an existing piece, along the same lines as <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/wAczufCpMdaamF9fy/my-objections-to-we-re-all-gonna-die-with-eliezer-yudkowsky\">Quintin Pope's article</a> \"My Objections to \"We\u2019re All Gonna Die with Eliezer Yudkowsky\"\". By contrast, it would be intended to address the EA community as a whole, since I'm aware many EAs already disagree with Yudkowsky even if they buy the basic arguments for AI x-risks.</p><p><strong>My question is: what is the current best single article (or set of articles) that provide a well-reasoned and comprehensive case for believing that there is a substantial (&gt;10%) probability of an AI catastrophe this century?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I was considering replying to <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.13353.pdf\">Joseph Carlsmith's article</a>, \"Is Power-Seeking AI an Existential Risk?\", since it seemed reasonably comprehensive and representative of the concerns EAs have about AI x-risk. However, I'm a bit worried that the article is not very representative of EAs who have substantial probabilities of doom, since he originally estimated a total risk of catastrophe at only 5% before 2070. In May 2022, Carlsmith changed his mind and reported a higher probability, but I am not sure whether this is because he has been exposed to new arguments, or because he simply thinks the stated arguments are stronger than he originally thought.</p><p>I suspect I have both significant moral disagreements and significant empirical disagreements with EAs, and I want to include both in such an article, while mainly focusing on the empirical points. For example, I have the feeling that I disagree with most EAs about:</p><ul><li>How bad human disempowerment would likely be from a utilitarian perspective, and what \"human disempowerment\" even means in the first place</li><li>Whether there will be a treacherous turn event, during which AIs violently take over the world after previously having been behaviorally aligned with humans</li><li>How likely AIs are to coordinate near-perfectly with each other as a unified front, leaving humans out of their coalition</li><li>Whether we should expect AI values to be \"alien\" (like paperclip maximizers) in the absence of extraordinary efforts to align them with humans</li><li>Whether the AIs themselves will be significant moral patients, on par with humans</li><li>Whether there will be a qualitative moment when \"the AGI\" is created, rather than systems incrementally getting more advanced, with no clear finish line</li><li>Whether we get only \"one critical try\" to align AGI</li><li>Whether \"AI lab leaks\" are an important source of AI risk</li><li>How likely AIs are to kill every single human if they are unaligned with humans</li><li>Whether there will be a \"value lock-in\" event soon after we create powerful AI that causes values to cease their evolution over the coming billions of years</li><li>How bad problems related to \"specification gaming\" will be in the future</li><li>How society is likely to respond to AI risks, and whether they'll sleepwalk into a catastrophe</li></ul><p>However, I also disagree with points made by many <i>other</i> EAs who have argued against the standard AI risk case. For example, I think that,</p><ul><li>AIs will eventually become vastly more powerful and smarter than humans. So, I think AIs will eventually be able to \"<a href=\"https://www.cold-takes.com/ai-could-defeat-all-of-us-combined/\">defeat all of us combined</a>\"</li><li>I think a benign \"AI takeover\" event is very likely even if we align AIs successfully</li><li>AIs will likely be goal-directed in the future. I don't think, for instance, that we can just \"not give the AIs goals\" and then everything will be OK.</li><li>I think it's highly plausible that AIs will end up with substantially different values from humans (although I don't think this will necessarily cause a catastrophe).</li><li>I don't think we have strong evidence that deceptive alignment is an easy problem to solve at the moment</li><li>I think it's plausible that AI takeoff will be relatively fast, and the world will be dramatically transformed over a period of several months or a few years</li><li>I think short timelines, meaning a dramatic transformation of the world within 10 years from now, is pretty plausible</li></ul><p>I'd like to elaborate on as many of these points as possible, preferably by responding to direct quotes from the representative article arguing for the alternative, more standard EA perspective.</p>", "user": {"username": "Matthew_Barnett"}}, {"_id": "KkevnyCyi2qWEgSxv", "title": "EA for Christians 2024 Conference in D.C. | May 18-19 ", "postedAt": "2023-12-15T20:48:26.380Z", "htmlBody": "<p>EACH's <a href=\"https://www.eaforchristians.org/each-2024-conference\">annual conference</a> is its largest event all year, bringing together 100 Christians in the EA movement for talks, workshops, 1-on-1s, and prayer.</p><p>Apply <a href=\"https://airtable.com/appix6TEWgfthnA8Z/shrTCEoikb6TE37CY\">here</a><a href=\"https://airtable.com/shraNv8az6E1aEo1d\"> </a>and share with Christians you know.</p><p>We welcome our keynote speaker Caleb Watney, cofounder of the <a href=\"https://ifp.org/\">Institute for Progress</a>.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/KkevnyCyi2qWEgSxv/pegapfd7hqjdobojgxrn\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/KkevnyCyi2qWEgSxv/g3uu5doohpafvy3zxqqz 700w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/KkevnyCyi2qWEgSxv/lincmktzr8pfapxpyy4m 1400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/KkevnyCyi2qWEgSxv/mr4g7760cwqnxzya0hyo 2100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/KkevnyCyi2qWEgSxv/ak6n3pre84gwb9tupjxf 2800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/KkevnyCyi2qWEgSxv/wspwnpnzs6h3jav3f6bi 3500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/KkevnyCyi2qWEgSxv/sspgikd67exhffevb20o 4200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/KkevnyCyi2qWEgSxv/o0gck3wxlbeuaw615kqd 4900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/KkevnyCyi2qWEgSxv/y7mnrbqwdeglkgvhgdeo 5600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/KkevnyCyi2qWEgSxv/xeasyhqrgof5d7nlj72w 6300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/KkevnyCyi2qWEgSxv/qs25qmyrfn5ncidiwnua 6912w\"><img><br>____</p><p>This conference is a fantastic opportunity to:<br><br>\u2013<strong>Hear </strong>from excellent speakers about themes relevant to the intersection of EA &amp; Christianity.<br>\u2013 <strong>Meet </strong>some of the over <a href=\"https://www.eaforchristians.org/community-directory\">500 Christians</a> in the global effective altruism movemen<strong>t</strong><br>\u2013 <strong>Build </strong>your plans to improve the world, especially through high-impact careers and effective giving.&nbsp;</p><p>This event is primarily an in-person event.

Below are the episode summary and some key excerpts.</p><h2><strong>Episode summary</strong></h2><blockquote><p><i>I always wonder if one part of it is just the really invisible nature of lead as a poison. Of course impacts aren\u2019t invisible: millions of deaths and trillions of dollars in lost income. But the fact that lead is the cause is not apparent. It\u2019s not apparent when you\u2019re being exposed to the lead. The paint just looks like any other paint; the cookware looks like any other cookware.</i></p><p><i>And also, if you are suffering the effects of lead poisoning, if you have cognitive impairment and heart disease, you\u2019re not going to think, \u201cOh, it was that lead exposure.\u201d It\u2019s just not going to be clear.</i></p><p>- Lucia Coulter</p></blockquote><p>Lead is one of the most poisonous things going. A single sugar sachet of lead, spread over a park the size of an American football field, is enough to give a child that regularly plays there lead poisoning. For life they\u2019ll be condemned to a ~3-point-lower IQ; a 50% higher risk of heart attacks; and elevated risk of kidney disease, anaemia, and ADHD, among other effects.</p><p>We\u2019ve known lead is a health nightmare for at least 50 years, and that got lead out of car fuel everywhere. So is the situation under control? Not even close.</p><p>Around half the kids in poor and middle-income countries have blood lead levels above 5 micrograms per decilitre; the US declared a national emergency when just 5% of the children in Flint, Michigan exceeded that level. The collective damage this is doing to children\u2019s intellectual potential, health, and life expectancy is vast \u2014 the health damage involved is around that caused by malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV combined.</p><p>This week\u2019s guest, Lucia Coulter \u2014 cofounder of the incredibly successful <a href=\"https://leadelimination.org/\">Lead Exposure Elimination Project</a> (LEEP) \u2014 speaks about how LEEP has been reducing childhood lead exposure in poor countries by getting bans on lead in paint enforced.</p><p>Various estimates suggest the work is absurdly cost effective. LEEP is in expectation preventing kids from getting lead poisoning <a href=\"https://www.founderspledge.com/research/lead-exposure-elimination-project-leep\">for under $2 per child</a> (explore the analysis <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Q3YpnHrg9hkax5r6YaZxThEvGSSy8--N-eiQdcXgNI0/edit#gid=679643831\">here</a>). Or, looking at it differently, LEEP is <a href=\"https://leadelimination.org/malawi_cost-effectiveness_intro/\">saving a year of healthy life for $14</a>, and in the long run is increasing people\u2019s lifetime income anywhere from $300\u20131,200 for each $1 it spends, by preventing intellectual stunting.</p><p>Which raises the question: why hasn\u2019t this happened already? How is lead still in paint in most poor countries, even when that\u2019s oftentimes already illegal? And how is LEEP able to get bans on leaded paint enforced in a country while spending barely tens of thousands of dollars? When leaded paint is gone, what should they target next?</p><p>With host Robert Wiblin, Lucia answers all those questions and more:</p><ul><li>Why LEEP isn\u2019t fully funded, and what it would do with extra money (you can donate <a href=\"https://leadelimination.org/\">here</a>).</li><li>How bad lead poisoning is in rich countries.</li><li>Why lead is still in aeroplane fuel.</li><li>How lead got put straight in food in Bangladesh, and a handful of people got it removed.</li><li>Why the enormous damage done by lead mostly goes unnoticed.</li><li>The other major sources of lead exposure aside from paint.</li><li>Lucia\u2019s story of founding a highly effective nonprofit, despite having no prior entrepreneurship experience, through <a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/\">Charity Entrepreneurship\u2019s Incubation Program</a>.</li><li>Why Lucia pledges 10% of her income to cost-effective charities.</li><li>Lucia\u2019s take on why GiveWell didn\u2019t support LEEP earlier on.</li><li>How the <a href=\"https://www.leaddetectprize.com/\">invention of cheap, accessible lead testing</a> for blood and consumer products would be a game changer.</li><li>Generalisable lessons LEEP has learned from coordinating with governments in poor countries.</li><li>And plenty more.</li></ul><p><i>Producer and editor: Keiran Harris</i><br><i>Audio Engineering Lead: Ben Cordell</i><br><i>Technical editing: Milo McGuire and Dominic Armstrong</i><br><i>Transcriptions: Katy Moore</i></p><h2><strong>Highlights</strong></h2><h3><strong>How bad lead is</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Lucia Coulter:</strong> So lead is extremely toxic. One way to think about why is that basically, it mimics calcium and other metal ions that serve these essential functions in pretty much every part of the body. And we\u2019ve evolved for the vast majority of our history in an environment where lead was buried in the earth, so our cells are just not well adapted to tolerate any of this interference. And it interrupts many different subcellular processes, and that affects pretty much every organ system.</p><p>So we could think about it in terms of what would the impact be on the average child in a low- or middle-income country? The average child in a low- or middle-income country has a blood lead level of around 5 micrograms per decilitre, and that\u2019s high enough to cause health, educational, and economic impacts. So a child with that blood lead level would have a reduction in IQ anywhere from around one to six IQ points, depending on which analysis you take. That, in turn, will affect their future earning potential. They\u2019ll also have reduced educational attainment. There was a <a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/publication/how-much-would-reducing-lead-exposure-improve-childrens-learning-developing-world\">recent analysis</a> by the Center for Global Development that pretty conservatively concluded that would be equivalent to around one year of lost schooling.</p><p>And then it also causes an increased likelihood of cardiovascular disease and mortality from cardiovascular disease. And that could be as high as a relative risk of around 1.5 at the average level of lead exposure that children have in low- and middle-income countries. That\u2019s according to a <a href=\"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanplh/article/PIIS2542-5196(23)00166-3/fulltext\">recent analysis of US data</a>.</p><p>And then on top of all of that, it increases risk of kidney disease, anaemia, foetal health problems, behavioural disorders, ADHD, and possibly even mental health problems and dementia.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> So one thing is, because we evolved for so long in an environment where lead was not present, we don\u2019t have any bodily process for removing lead. So it tends to just hang around in the body for a very long time, and it ends up in all kinds of different tissues. I think in adults, often it can end up in the bones, and it tends to hang around there a long time and then gradually leach out, over decades even. But it\u2019s not something that you just consume and then pee out very quickly. It hangs around for a long time.</p><p>And as you\u2019re saying, it mimics other metal ions that we do need to use, so it interferes with all kinds of different enzymes throughout the body that are doing just the basic work of a cell. It\u2019s getting in there and just screwing them up constantly. It\u2019s also mimicking calcium ions in the brain, so it gets into the brain and then it screws up the ability to send signals between neurons.</p><p><strong>Lucia Coulter:</strong> And that\u2019s particularly dangerous when children are very young and their brains are developing, because that\u2019s such a complex and delicate process \u2014 which is why it has such a severe impact on young children, by impacting the way that their brains are forming and all those neurons are connecting in the very early years.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>How many times more damage lead is doing in low- and middle-income countries</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> If I understand correctly, 40 years ago about 90% of people\u2019s exposure to lead, in rich countries at least, was coming <a href=\"https://today.duke.edu/2017/03/lead-exposure-childhood-linked-lower-iq-lower-status\">via leaded petrol</a>, which has now been almost completely eliminated everywhere. Well, I guess except for <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avgas\">avgas</a>. This is one crazy thing that I learned: that we haven\u2019t figured out a way to run planes safely without putting lead in the petrol there, which is one of the top reasons now that people still get exposed to lead in countries like the UK or the US. But anyway, as a result of getting rid of leaded gasoline, we\u2019ve seen a <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/americaschildrenenvironment/biomonitoring-lead\">massive decrease in lead levels in children in the US</a> \u2014 by around 90% since the late \u201970s, and probably something in that ballpark for the UK and Australia, although I think that the data on that is surprisingly rickety; it was a little bit hard to find any good systematic studies of that in recent years.</p><p>But an interesting thing is that the research suggests that most damage is done by the first bits of lead that you get exposed to: it\u2019s actually the first milligram that\u2019s doing the most damage per milligram, and then you get gradually declining damage, which is counterintuitive. I suppose the mechanism might be that, as you get exposed to more and more lead, all the damage that can be done by lead specifically has already been done; it kind of runs out of low-hanging fruit to harm you even more.</p><p>Anyway, if that\u2019s the case, the damage that lead is doing to people\u2019s health \u2014 even in rich countries, where the exposure levels have been reduced 90% \u2014 could still be really quite meaningful. It\u2019s not necessarily enough to reduce it 90% \u2014 you really want to reduce it by more like 99% or 99.9% in order to feel comfortable that we\u2019ve done enough.</p><p>One thing I\u2019ll just note is that listeners might recall all of the news coverage of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flint_water_crisis\">Flint, Michigan</a> a couple of years ago where they screwed up something about their water supply and children were getting exposed to lead above the US\u2019s permitted limits. But the blood lead levels that led to the declaration of a national emergency in the US are just completely standard in India: I think 5% of the children in that city had blood lead levels above 5, but I think two-thirds of children in India have that level of lead in their blood, and that\u2019s just regarded as completely normal and a matter of course. It\u2019s kind of crazy.</p><p>Anyway, that is a huge lead-in to this question: How many times more damage is lead doing in countries that LEEP operates in, as opposed to countries like the US or UK, where most listeners live?</p><p><strong>Lucia Coulter:</strong> Yeah, it\u2019s really crazy, that statistic. So LEEP operates in low- and middle-income countries, and 95% of the global burden of lead poisoning roughly is concentrated in low- and middle-income countries. In low- and middle-income countries, the average blood lead level is around 5 micrograms per decilitre, which is classified as lead poisoning \u2014 so on average, most children have lead poisoning. And in high-income countries, the average childhood blood lead level is around 1 microgram per decilitre. It\u2019s a bit lower than that in the US. And like you say, the data is not amazing anywhere on this, but it\u2019s about five times lower in high-income countries.</p><p>And the Flint, Michigan example is really stark. I think that was a huge crisis, having 5% of children in Flint, Michigan with lead poisoning. But the fact that just every single day, 50% of children in low- and middle-income countries have that level of lead poisoning is really concerning, really troubling.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Why hasn't this problem already been solved?</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> We\u2019ve known for at least 100 years that lead is poisonous. I guess we can see that because France <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lead_paint\">banned leaded paint</a> in 1909. I think they were one of the first countries to do it. But nonetheless, they thought it was sufficiently dodgy that there was lead going in paint in houses that they banned it 110 years ago. And apparently even the ancient Romans suspected that lead was bad for you. I guess they probably didn\u2019t have gold standard randomised controlled trials, but they probably noticed that people who worked in lead mines ended up with extreme health problems, and figured out that lead was probably bad for you.</p><p>Is there a simple reason why this problem hasn\u2019t already been solved? Why didn\u2019t we know in the 19th century to stop adding lead to stuff that people were going to be eating?</p><p><strong>Lucia Coulter:</strong> I think it\u2019s a good question. It\u2019s probably not that simple of an answer. I think to start with, lead is just a really useful metal: it\u2019s abundant, it\u2019s malleable, it\u2019s durable, and its compounds make loads of really helpful things \u2014 like strong glazes, bright pigments, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiknock_agent\">antiknocking fuels</a>. I think in the \u201920s the industry in the US described lead as \u201ca gift from God\u201d because it\u2019s just such a great thing. So I think people will just keep using it unless they aren\u2019t able to, unless they\u2019re strongly incentivised not to.</p><p>I think another reason is that there is extremely low awareness of both the prevalence of lead poisoning and the harms of lead poisoning, and the sources of exposure. Low awareness generally, but also among important decision-makers, important institutions, and low- and middle-income country governments and funders. I guess that leads to the question: Why is the awareness so low?</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Yeah, maybe this is something that a historian should be looking into understanding. Maybe they could find some mentions in parliamentary records or something from the 19th century of people raising the question of whether lead was safe. There must have been some stuff written about it, if it was banned in France in 1909. But why is it that that didn\u2019t win the day? Why is it that industry, that wanted to add lead to things, won out the debate?</p><p><strong>Lucia Coulter:</strong> Yeah, I always wonder if one part of it is just the really invisible nature of lead as a poison. Of course impacts aren\u2019t invisible: millions of deaths and trillions of dollars in lost income. But the fact that lead is the cause is not apparent. It\u2019s not apparent when you\u2019re being exposed to the lead. The paint just looks like any other paint; the cookware looks like any other cookware. And also, if you are suffering the effects of lead poisoning, if you have cognitive impairment and heart disease, you\u2019re not going to think, \u201cOh, it was that lead exposure.\u201d It\u2019s just not going to be clear.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> I guess it\u2019s an issue with how we tend to treat specific acute diseases and be very aware of that, but then everyone suffering some relatively small chronic impact just doesn\u2019t really rise to the level of anyone\u2019s notice and cause a public outcry.</p><p><strong>Lucia Coulter:</strong> Yes, exactly. And the symptoms aren\u2019t specifically characteristic of the cause. It\u2019s not like malaria, where you get cyclical fevers and it\u2019s like, obviously something going on here. I think that\u2019s part of it as well.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>What LEEP set out to attempt in Malawi</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Lucia Coulter:</strong> We were helping the Malawi Bureau of Standards \u2014 supporting them with testing capacity, updating their regulation to make it more enforceable, and making sure that the right samples were being collected. It needs to be coloured paints, because they\u2019re much more likely to be leaded than white paints. And the default globally for anyone doing monitoring of a paint industry would be to just collect white paints, so you\u2019d naturally miss lead in that. So that\u2019s a bit of a process. And then industry typically is unlikely to reformulate until they feel that there will be consequences.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Did you call them up and say\u2026 ?</p><p><strong>Lucia Coulter:</strong> We spoke to them before we did the study, and we said, \u201cYou\u2019re aware of lead as an issue in paint?\u201d and that sort of thing. Broadly, they said that they were aware of it, but that maybe some other manufacturers were doing it, but not them. So then we come back with the results and we say, \u201cThere is a lot of lead in your paint.\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cAh, OK\u201d \u2014 and at that point we offer our support.</p><p>So we can help in quite a few ways. We have a paint technologist who\u2019s absolutely amazing, who can give really detailed technical support with the switch. We can help them find suppliers of the non-lead raw materials, which can sometimes be a barrier because their usual suppliers might not necessarily supply these non-lead alternatives. We also offer to retest their paints for them so they can be confident that they\u2019re lead-free and that sort of thing.</p><p>Some of them engaged, some of them didn\u2019t really. Some of them said to us, like, \u201cI don\u2019t really know. Does the Malawi Bureau of Standards really have testing capacity? Do we really have to do this?\u201d And so we were like \u2014</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Wow, that\u2019s ballsy to be saying, \u201cOK, sure, you busted us, but we don\u2019t think that you have the testing capacity to check again, officially.\u201d</p><p><strong>Lucia Coulter:</strong> Yeah, exactly.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Interesting. Were any of them mortified? Sounds like no.</p><p><strong>Lucia Coulter:</strong> No, not that was apparent to me. I mean, I don\u2019t know how they were feeling internally. In a professional context, you might not really let on your real feelings about it. I think that from the perspective of a manufacturer, they\u2019re only putting in a small amount of lead: 1% intuitively doesn\u2019t feel like that much, right?</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> It\u2019s just a splash of lead. Just a little bit.</p><p><strong>Lucia Coulter:</strong> Just a tad. So I think it\u2019s not intuitive, how bad that could be. One way of communicating it is that if you had a little sugar sachet \u2014 the type that you would get at a cafe to put in your coffee \u2014 if that was filled with lead dust, and you sprinkled it across an area the size of an American football field, that level of lead loading would be sufficient to cause lead poisoning if a child spent time in that environment. So a very, very small amount of lead can have these really toxic effects. And that\u2019s not intuitive; that\u2019s pretty surprising.</p><p>So I think that\u2019s probably how people think about it. But often manufacturers, in some of our experience, will move really quickly. Sometimes days after we show them the results, they\u2019ve ordered their non-lead alternative ingredients.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>Lead paint vs other sources of lead</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Lucia Coulter:</strong> There are many different sources of lead exposure in low- and middle-income countries. Paint we\u2019ve talked about. Others include aluminium cookware, lead-glazed ceramics, cosmetics, lead-adulterated spices, water systems, lead-acid battery recycling, mining, and recycling. There are probably others too that we don\u2019t even really know about yet. And we don\u2019t really know which exposures are most significant in which countries, or the relative contribution of different sources in different areas: there\u2019s a big lack of data. It does look like it varies a lot geographically, but there\u2019s enough to make some educated guesses.</p><p>As to why we\u2019re focused on paint, it\u2019s because it seems like a widespread, important source of exposure that\u2019s also unusually tractable and also very neglected. I think the tractability is probably a really important factor, and possibly more differentiating than those others. We know that with a little bit of support, low- and middle-income country governments can get lead paint off the market, which is a big reason why it\u2019s so cost effective to work on.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Let\u2019s just pause again on what those other sources are. So there\u2019s lead-acid batteries from cars: there\u2019s people who are doing informal recycling of those, I assume in pretty poor areas. And of course, if you\u2019re involved in that, that\u2019s a massive exposure of lead for you.</p><p><strong>Lucia Coulter:</strong> Yeah, or if you live nearby.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> I guess it ends up in the soil if you live nearby. So that\u2019s going to be concentrated in particular locations, but then very severe in those spots.</p><p><strong>Lucia Coulter:</strong> Exactly.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Then, I did not know this until recently, but there\u2019s lead put sometimes in crockery that people are eating off of. And you\u2019re saying there\u2019s lead glazes, so sometimes you put colourful decorations onto bowls that people are eating out of, and that can have very high concentrations of lead in it.</p><p><strong>Lucia Coulter:</strong> Yeah. So the kind of paint put on bowls or whatever, that can have very high concentrations of lead. But also just the normal glaze that\u2019s used to seal a piece of pottery, like just the normal ceramic, that often has very high levels of lead. It can be sealed and fired at high temperatures and done in a way that means that the lead doesn\u2019t leach into the foods very much, but in many low- and middle-income countries, it\u2019s done in a way where it does leach into the food a lot. In South America and Latin America that\u2019s been a big problem, probably also in a number of other regions as well.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> But people haven\u2019t even identified that it\u2019s an issue yet.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>What if we had cheap lead tests?</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> A different angle on how to get a really big systemic change here: How much does it cost to test for lead in someone\u2019s blood? We said it was $27 or so for a sample of paint. How much for a person\u2019s blood sample?</p><p><strong>Lucia Coulter:</strong> It\u2019s probably similar. Probably you could get it at around that price.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> How much of a game changer would it be to <a href=\"https://www.leaddetectprize.com/\">have a way of easily and really cheaply measuring lead in blood</a> or in objects or in paint? What if you could do it for a dollar or less?</p><p><strong>Lucia Coulter:</strong> That would be huge. That would be a game changer. If you could measure the lead content of objects \u2014 like paint or other sources of exposure \u2014 cheaply, accurately, and also in a really low-tech, simple, easy way, that would be huge for the government testing capacity problem. You could imagine, like this lead gun that we have here, if a government regulatory authority could have one of those and it was going to be accurate and it wasn\u2019t going to break, that they could just go around testing loads of things and enforce on the basis of it. So I think that would be a real game changer.</p><p>There is work to try and get these portable XRF devices, to try and figure out with what method can the result be accurate enough that it could be used for enforcement by a low- or middle-income country government. We were talking just over the last few weeks with Stanford University and Mercer University, where they\u2019ve been working on methods to get accurate results so that you can use XRF for paint testing. And they\u2019re hoping to get a project funded so that that can be an approved method by these international standards bodies. And then if it were an approved method, then governments could actually do that, and that would be pretty big, I think.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Got it. So there are some ways of doing this that there\u2019s ways that we could try to make it a bunch cheaper. Our current issue is that these things are kind of roughly accurate, but they\u2019re not nearly as precisely accurate. So governments are wary of imposing penalties on businesses or telling them they can\u2019t sell something based on the x-ray gun because it\u2019s not quite as precise as sending it off to a lab for measurement.</p><p><strong>Lucia Coulter:</strong> Yeah. And also the x-ray guns are expensive. They can cost like $20,000 or $30,000. But they\u2019re less expensive than the lab-based methods.</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> If you test enough things, yeah.</p><p><strong>Lucia Coulter:</strong> And you wouldn\u2019t need many of them. I mean, they\u2019re less expensive than the lab-based methods if you have to have your own testing equipment. If you can use an international lab, then that would be pretty low cost.</p></blockquote><h3><strong>\"Very brief opportunistic interventions\"</strong></h3><blockquote><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> Here\u2019s a completely different angle: I suppose this is not actually a more systematic intervention; this is almost the opposite of that. But I think doctors sometimes do what are called \u201cvery brief opportunistic interventions,\u201d where they just ask someone when they happen to be in with another health issue, they happen to be in the GP office, are they interested in quitting smoking? And then if they say yes, then they help them out and instruct them on how to do that.</p><p>Now, this doesn\u2019t prompt that many people to quit, as you might imagine. It\u2019s a very light-touch intervention. But it can be really cost effective in terms of quits per hour of physician time, because it takes almost no effort per person to do this. So it\u2019s recommended that physicians give this a go basically every time they get the chance.</p><p>Maybe the same principle could work here. Could you just call up every paint factory, basically, in sub-Saharan Africa and say, \u201cDo you know whether you use lead? Do you realise that this is extremely bad for children\u2019s health? Have you considered quitting lead? Have you considered putting something else in your paint?\u201d And then maybe 1% of them or 10% of them, that might be all that\u2019s needed in order to prompt them to take action. What do you reckon?</p><p><strong>Lucia Coulter:</strong> I love it. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a crazy idea. The other thing you could do is raw material suppliers. Suppliers of non-lead alternatives provide free samples. So you could also say, \u201cAnd would you like to receive a free sample?\u201d And then just send it to them.</p><p>I think usually it is harder to engage with manufacturers when you haven\u2019t done a paint study and you don\u2019t have the results. And usually they won\u2019t act until regulation is on the horizon. But that\u2019s not always the case, and I think you\u2019d get some hits. So, over the past few months, we have started trying to engage manufacturers a lot earlier. And it does seem promising, but I think if anyone\u2019s got some free hours and just wants to start cold calling\u2026</p><p><strong>Rob Wiblin:</strong> \u201cOur paint technicians are standing by to reformulate your paint.\u201d To be honest, I don\u2019t know if this is actually a good idea, because it seems like with a reasonable amount of money, you\u2019re on track to target all of the paint factories in large countries, at least in sub-Saharan Africa, for example, by doing these paint studies and getting the government to take action. So maybe if you had one person who had only $10,000, maybe this would be the best that they could do. But given that you have more people and more expertise and you are trying to scale, this probably seems less cost effective to me.</p><p><strong>Lucia Coulter:</strong> Yeah, maybe for us, but if someone\u2019s got free time\u2026</p></blockquote>", "user": {"username": "80000_Hours"}}, {"_id": "yFTgE7DtGcpnnxBJQ", "title": "The Global Fight Against Lead Poisoning, Explained (A Happier World video)", "postedAt": "2023-12-15T18:04:15.875Z", "htmlBody": "<p>In this video, I explore the issue of lead poisoning with turmeric adulteration as the angle.</p><p>I interviewed Drew McCartor from Pure Earth, Rachel Silverman from the Center for Global Development and Kris Newby who reported on turmeric adulteration for Stanford.

Turmeric.</i></p><p>Turns out turmeric, known for giving curry its iconic golden hue, might contain a toxic secret. Some manufacturers add lead, a poisonous metal with no safe level of exposure.</p><p>Lead poisoning impacts 1 in 3 children worldwide, significantly hindering their development. In adults it can cause cardiovascular problems and early death.</p><p>We often associate lead with paint or old water pipes, but apparently it\u2019s in spices too! While the West has largely tackled lead poisoning, it remains a major concern elsewhere.</p><p>So I have to know: Why do they add lead to turmeric? Is my curry here in Europe safe? And how can we prevent lead poisoning in children?&nbsp;</p><p><i>The scale of the issue is enormous. 800 million children, probably many billions of adults.</i></p><p><i>A lot of the damages last forever.</i></p><p>In this video, I'll explore the scale of the issue, test my own turmeric for lead, and highlight worldwide actions against lead poisoning.</p><p>In the early 1990s, Mohammad Abdullah Sheikh was drawn to the bright yellow of turmeric at a market.</p><p>Curious, he learned from the traders that this color is achieved by adding a substance called peuri. So he applied their advice to his own turmeric business. Over the next 30 years, his sales boosted significantly. Consumers clearly preferred the brighter turmeric. Peuri is better known to us as lead chromate, the same chemical that was used to paint those classic yellow school buses.&nbsp;</p><p>This practice was widespread among turmeric traders. But that changed in 2019, when Stanford researchers discovered the lead in turmeric exceeded Bangladesh\u2019s legal limit up to 500 times. They informed traders like Sheikh about lead chromate's health risks. But by then it was too late: the turmeric was already being exported, making it a global issue.</p><p>This is Saim. He resides with his family in Mirzapur, Bangladesh. For over three years, they lived next to two illegal battery recycling factories. These factories released lead dust into the air, contaminating nearby neighborhoods.</p><p>By the time workers abandoned the factory in February 2019, over 200 children were poisoned.</p><p>I talked with Pure Earth\u2019s executive director, Drew McCartor, to better understand this issue.&nbsp;</p><p><i>As most people know, lead is a toxic heavy metal. It's a neurotoxin, so it has a whole host of negative impacts to the human body. The ones that we worry about the most are usually permanent brain damage of young children and effects to adults that increase their rates of cardiovascular disease.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>The human body does not need any amount of lead. There are certain metals that the body needs. Lead just is not one of them.</i></p><p><i>And it\u2019s particularly problematic because our body thinks it looks very, very similar to calcium.&nbsp;</i></p><p>This is Rachel Silverman from the Center for Global Development, she works on lead poisoning.</p><p><i>And calcium, of course, we need for all sorts of human functions, and especially neurological functions.</i></p><p><i>We estimate that about 800 million children around the world have blood levels that can be considered lead poisoning. It's a very large number.</i></p><p><i>So the World Bank just completed an assessment, an analysis of how many people die from lead exposure related heart disease, and they estimate that it's 5.5 million. To put that in comparison, that's more people than are estimated to die from AIDS or malaria or tuberculosis or natural disasters or automobile deaths or any of these other issues that more frequently make the front page of a newspaper than lead poisoning does.</i></p><p>It's not just health, it's economics too. Lead exposure costs some countries over 10 percent of their GDP.</p><p>Many adults, even in the west, still have high blood lead levels. While the issue isn't completely resolved here either, strict regulations and big investments have greatly reduced lead exposure.</p><p>At the height of the water crisis in Flint Michigan, where lead was found in drinking water, around 4% of children had lead poisoning, compared to about 3% in other wealthy countries. The situation was rightly deemed severe, but the current levels of lead poisoning in poorer countries are 10 times worse. Over half of all children in low and middle income countries have lead poisoning.</p><p><i>As an American, when we think of lead poisoning, we think of leaded gasoline, leaded paint and lead pipes. Those are not the main causes of lead poisoning around the world.</i></p><p>The biggest sources of lead really depend from country to country. But sources that often come up are contaminated soil from industrial activities, cookware like pots and pans both metallic and ceramic, toys, jewelry, cosmetics, traditional medicines and spices.</p><p><i>So for spices, globally, we took an assessment of lots of different types of spices from 25 countries and found that 2% of them kind of exceeded the relevant safety level for lead.</i></p><p><i>But if you zero in on particular locations that are known to be hot spots for adulterating spices with lead-based pigments, then that percentage goes way, way up, particularly if you isolate for a specific spice that's known to be a problem.&nbsp;</i></p><p>There are cases of turmeric causing lead poisoning in children in Seattle and lead exceeding the maximum safety levels over a thousand times in New York City.&nbsp;</p><p>So I wonder: Does lead-tainted turmeric reach me here in Belgium?&nbsp;</p><p>I went to different kinds of stores to buy turmeric: known supermarkets like Aldi and Lidl, but also a smaller Moroccan store, an Asian store and an organic store. But in Aldi I could only find turmeric as part of a curry mix.</p><p>Now how do I test these? According to the internet, there are a few tests you can do at home.&nbsp;</p><p>One I came across frequently was putting turmeric in water to see if the powder settles down all the way. If after about 20 minutes it does, then it\u2019s pure. If it\u2019s cloudy, it means it\u2019s adulterated.</p><p>So let\u2019s try it on our turmeric!</p><p>It looks pure to me but honestly I don\u2019t know how to tell. I guess this one is darker because I used more. And I didn\u2019t test the curry mix of course because I don\u2019t know if that counts. But anyway, does this experiment really work?</p><p><i>This is a pretty rudimentary test. We have not validated the accuracy of that. So I can't tell you really if that works or not. But if it did, it would probably just be indicating whether this is adulterated and have extraordinary levels or no lead.</i></p><p>I couldn\u2019t really find any evidence of this working either. But maybe it does, I don\u2019t know.</p><p>There are home testing kits that change color when exposed to lead, but the compound in turmeric that causes its yellow color, curcumin, interferes with the results.</p><p>Then what does work?</p><p><i>The nice thing about the Stanford approach with Bangladesh was they used this new ray gun, a portable analyzer that could just point it out and with the proper software in it, you could tell if it had lead in it.</i></p><p>This is Kris Newby, she\u2019s a medical science writer who wrote an article for Stanford on the discovery of lead in turmeric. A portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer or pXRF has a detection limit of about 2 parts per million, which is comparable to national food standards.<i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>An x-ray gun sounds really cool, so maybe I should use that. How much can it cost?</p><p>Well, that\u2019s out of my budget. So, what else can I do?</p><p><i>In an academic setting or a laboratory setting, you would test it and you would put it through a mass spectrometer, which uses lasers to break anything you put in the way of the lasers into its molecular elements. And then sophisticated software creates a report and tells you what is in the turmeric.&nbsp;</i></p><p>An inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer or ICP-MS has a detection limit of 0.001 parts per million.&nbsp;</p><p>I traveled all the way to Roeselare to bring my turmeric to a laboratory that\u2019s part of INAGRO, a research institute serving the agriculture sector in Belgium.&nbsp;</p><p>The device places a sample in a chamber where hot plasma separates it into basic elements.</p><p>I gave them my samples and will now await the results.</p><p>After they discovered lead in turmeric, Stanford University and the Bangladeshi government launched a big campaign to inform manufacturers and consumers about the dangers.</p><p><i>The prime minister got on the television and said: we realize that lead poisoning in Bangladesh, which is a really serious problem, we need to get this tainted turmeric out. And we just wanna let you know, we're gonna start arresting people who taint turmeric.</i></p><p>A crackdown followed at the spice market with a bunch of policemen and public health officials. A Stanford-trained technician passed by each stall and used a portable X-ray fluorescence analyzer to test the turmeric.</p><p><i>And if there was lead in it, there was this grand show where they confiscated it and took it away and wrote fines immediately to the spice sellers who were tainting their turmeric.&nbsp;</i></p><p>The percentage of mills adding lead chromate to turmeric decreased from 30% in 2019 to 0% 2021. Consequently, lead contamination in turmeric also decreased, from 47% to an incredible 0% two years later.</p><p><i>It was an amazing solution to a very difficult problem.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Mohammad Abdullah Sheikh, following the crackdown on the use of lead chromate, turned a new leaf. Today, outside his mill, he proudly displays his turmeric \u2013 not as bright as before, but pure. He\u2019s happy with this color. The sentiment is shared by many in Bangladesh.</p><p><i>Because Bangladesh is such an enormous country in terms of its population, this intervention likely impacted many tens of millions of people.</i></p><p>The intervention in Bangladesh shows that progress is possible. But it\u2019s not the only example.</p><p><i>We borrowed a lot of the strategies from that intervention when we ran an intervention in the Republic of Georgia. The most recent analysis of spices in Georgia suggests that the problem is almost completely solved.</i></p><p>The largest source of lead throughout most of the 20th century was leaded gasoline. But after a successful global health campaign, Algeria became the final country to ban it in 2021.</p><p>In most high-income countries, the use of lead paint and lead pipes is either banned or strongly regulated. And where old pipes still exist, they add anti-corrosives to the water to stop lead contamination. As a result, lead poisoning levels plummeted. In the US alone, between 1978 and 2016, lead levels in children's blood decreased by 95%.</p><p>In countries where lead exposure is still high, we\u2019re making progress too.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Here's a map showing the percentage of tested paints with lead levels above 600 parts per million, far exceeding the recommended limit of 90 parts per million. Nonprofits like the Lead Exposure Elimination Project, or LEEP, work to address this.&nbsp;</p><p><i>In the US, in Europe, our paint does not have lead in it anymore. It hasn\u2019t for some time. There\u2019s no reason lead needs to be in paint and groups like LEEP have been very successful in working with governments and paint manufacturers to phase leaded paint out.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Madagascar, Sierra Leone, and Zimbabwe are now moving towards mandating lead-free paint. In Malawi and Pakistan, the regulation was there but now it\u2019s finally being enforced.</p><p>LEEP\u2019s future plans include researching lead in spices, continuing their mission to eliminate lead exposure globally.</p><p><i>So Pure Earth's mission is to prevent exposures to toxic chemicals. Right now we're totally focused on lead and mercury. We run a lot of programs that aim to understand the sources of exposure. So if we know that spices, for example, is a big cause of lead poisoning, we will design a spice specific intervention.</i></p><p>In May 2022, Pure Earth and the University of Dhaka's Department of Geology cleaned up the lead-contaminated areas near Saim and Shihab in Mirzapur, safeguarding 600 villagers and future generations. They're also partnering with the government to transform illegal recycling factories into safe, lawful operations..</p><p><i>We've done many, many dozens of these projects. They're very effective at reducing kids' levels of lead poisoning.</i></p><p>I bought turmeric from various stores and I'm going to test it for lead. Do you think some of my turmeric could contain lead?</p><p><i>I think the question of whether it contains lead and the question of whether it's been adulterated by lead are two different questions. So there have been some interesting consumer reports studies recently of say chocolate, and they found chocolate contains lead. But the reason it contains lead is just that it's grown in, I think in this case it was in Ghana, and Ghana has a fair amount of lead pollution in the soil, in the water, and so it's getting into the product. No one's trying to add it. But just as they\u2019re growing it, as they\u2019re processing it, it\u2019s there.</i></p><p><i>But whether or not that's actually unsafe in a meaningful way and is going to hurt you, it would really depend what quantity you're eating. And for some foods, you would have to eat quite a lot.</i></p><p><i>For a lot of countries, the regulatory threshold is around two parts per million of lead in the spice. And if one of your samples has been adulterated with a lead-based pigment, it will probably have many hundreds or even many thousands or tens of thousands parts per million lead.</i></p><p><i>I would be very surprised if it exceeded the norms. I would be very surprised if you find heavy metal contamination specifically by lead. All materials entering the European market, more specifically the Belgian market, are heavily tested. Up to today, I don't think I've seen, maybe in a few cases, and then I can count on one hand, where we find that the limit has been exceeded.</i>&nbsp;</p><p>So I just got the results back from the laboratory! Let\u2019s have a look.</p><p>I\u2019ll show my results on screen for you to pause and look at, but essentially none of my turmeric exceeded 0.4 parts per million. Which is well under the legal limit and far below levels of adulteration.</p><p>So yeah, everyone was right, it doesn\u2019t look like my turmeric got tampered with. At least not with lead. If you got yours at a regular supermarket it likely won\u2019t be either.</p><p>Now what do I do with all of these?</p><p>So is consuming turmeric safe? It depends on where you live. Here in Belgium and other countries with strict safety regulations, I'm not really worried. And there are many who claim turmeric has great health benefits, so maybe we need to use more of it. But I\u2019m not a health expert, so I suggest you do your own research or, better yet, ask an actual expert.</p><p>Thanks to the amazing work of the Stanford researchers and others, Bangladesh managed to essentially get rid of lead in turmeric within just 2 years. Organizations like Pure Earth, LEEP and the Center for Global Development ensure we keep making incredible progress.</p><p>I\u2019m grateful for all the journalists whose reporting inspired this video, and everyone else in the fight against lead exposure, including those I have failed to mention.</p><p>For more insights on creating a happier world, subscribe and hit the bell to get notified when new videos come out.

We can define the terms as follows:</p><p><strong>AI Aimability</strong> = Create AI systems that will do what the creator/developer/owner/user intends them to do, whether or not that thing is good or bad</p><p><strong>AI Goalcraft</strong> = Create goals for AI systems that we ultimately think lead to the best outcomes</p><p>Aimability is a relatively well-defined technical problem and in practice almost all of the technical work on AI Alignment is actually work on AI Aimability. Less Wrong has for a long time been concerned with Aimability failures (what Yudkowsky in the early days would have called \"Technical Failures of Friendly AI\") rather than failures of Goalcraft (old-school MIRI terminology would be \"Friendliness Content\").</p><p>The problem is that as the term \"AI Alignment\" has gained popularity, people have started to completely merge the definitions of Aimability and Goalcraft under the term \"Alignment\". I recently ran some <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RokoMijic/status/1735097868858307003\">Twitter polls</a> on this subject, and it seems that people are relatively evenly split between the two definitions.</p><p>This is a relatively bad state of affairs. We should not have the fate of the universe partially determined by how people interpret an ambiguous word.</p><p>In particular, the way we are using the term AI Alignment right now means that it's hard to solve the AI Goalcraft problem and easy to solve the Aimability problem, because there is a part of AI that is distinct from Aimability which the current terminology doesn't have a word for.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/sy4whuaczvLsn9PNc/ulzlqwnxnl6yvmmndbas\" alt=\"\"></p><p>Not having a word for what goals to give the most powerful AI system in the universe is certainly a problem, and it means that everyone will be attracted to the easier Aimability research where one can quickly get stuck in and show a concrete improvement on a metric and publish a paper.</p><p>Why doesn't the Less Wrong / AI risk community have good terminology for the right hand side of the diagram? Well, this (I think) goes back to a decision by Eliezer from the SL4 mailing list days that one should not discuss what the world would be like after the singularity, because a lot of time would be wasted arguing about politics, instead of the then more urgent problem of solving the AI Aimability problem (which was then called the control problem). At the time this decision was probably correct, but times have changed. There are now quite a few people working on Aimability, and far more are surely to come, and it also seems quite likely (though not certain) that Eliezer was wrong about how hard Aimability/Control actually is.</p><h2>Words Have Consequences</h2><p>This decision to not talk about AI goals or content might eventually result in some unscrupulous actors getting to define the actual content and goals of superintelligence, cutting the X-risk and LW community out of the only part of the AI saga that actually matters in the end. For example, the recent popularity of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_accelerationism#Intellectual_origin\">e/acc movement</a> has been associated with the Landian strain of AI goal content - acceleration towards a deliberate and final extermination of humanity, in order to appease the Thermodynamic God. And the field that calls itself AI Ethics has been tainted with extremist far-left ideology around DIE (Diversity, Inclusion and Equity) that is perhaps even more frightening than the Landian Accelerationist strain. By not having mainstream terminology for AI goals and content, we may cede the future of the universe to extremists.</p><p>I suggest the term \"AI Goalcraft\" for the study of which goals for AI systems we ultimately think lead to the best outcomes. The seminal work on AI Goalcraft is clearly Eliezer's <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/tag/coherent-extrapolated-volition\">Coherent Extrapolated Volition</a>, and I think we need to push that agenda further now that AI risk has been mainstreamed and there's a lot of money going into the Aimability/Control problem.</p><h2>Gud Car Studies</h2><p>What should we do with the term \"Alignment\" though? I'm not sure. I think it unfortunately leads people into confusion. It doesn't track the underlying reality - which I believe is that <i>action naturally factors into Goalcraft followed by Aimability</i>, and you can work on Aimability without knowing much about Goalcraft and vice-versa because <strong>the mechanisms of Aimability don't care much about what goal one is aiming at</strong>, and <strong>the structure of Goalcraft doesn't care much about how you're going to aim</strong> at the goal and stay on target. When people hear \"Aligned\" they just hear \"Good\", but with a side order of sophistication. It would be like if we lumped mechanical engineers who developed car engines in with computer scientists working on GPS navigators and called their field <i>Gud Car Studies</i>. Gud Car Studies is obviously an abomination of a term that doesn't properly reflect the underlying reality that designing a good engine is mostly independent of deciding where to drive the car to, and how to navigate there. I think that \"Alignment\" has unfortunately become the \"Gud Car Studies\" of our time.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/sy4whuaczvLsn9PNc/g9wcxntor1zfy8wzstra\" alt=\"\"></p><p>I'm at a loss as to what to do - I suspect that the term AI Alignment has already gotten away from us and we should stop using it and talk about Aimability and Goalcraft instead.<br><br>(<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/sy4whuaczvLsn9PNc/ai-alignment-is-a-dangerously-overloaded-term\">Crossposted </a>from the Less Wrong site)</p>", "user": {"username": "Roko"}}, {"_id": "FAJ5DCmucKnabkBNL", "title": "Incubating AI x-risk projects: some personal reflections", "postedAt": "2023-12-19T17:03:54.706Z", "htmlBody": "<p>In this post, I\u2019ll share some personal reflections on the work of the Rethink Priorities Existential Security Team (XST) this year on incubating projects to tackle x-risk from AI.</p><p>To quickly describe the work we did: with support from the Rethink Priorities Special Projects team (SP), XST solicited and prioritised among project ideas, developed the top ideas into concrete proposals, and sought founders for the most promising of those.&nbsp;As a result of this work, we ran one project internally and, if all goes well, we\u2019ll launch an external project in early January.</p><p>Note that&nbsp;<strong>this post is written from my (Ben Snodin\u2019s) personal perspective. Other XST team members or wider Rethink Priorities staff wouldn\u2019t necessarily endorse the claims made in this post.</strong> Also,&nbsp;<strong>the various takes I\u2019m giving in this post are generally fairly low confidence and low resilience.</strong> These are just some quick thoughts based on my experience leading a team incubating AI x-risk projects for a little over half a year. I was keen to share something on this topic even though I didn't have time to come to thoroughly considered views.</p><h2>Key points</h2><ul><li>Between April 1st and December 1st, Rethink Priorities dedicated approximately 2.5 full-time equivalent (FTE) years of labour, mostly from XST, towards XST\u2019s strategy for incubating AI x-risk projects.</li><li>We decided to run one project ourselves, a project in the AI advocacy space that we\u2019ve been running since June.</li><li>We\u2019re in the late stages of launching one new project that works to equip talented university students interested in mitigating extreme AI risks with the skills and background to enter a US policy career.</li><li>A very rough estimate, based on our inputs and outputs to date, suggests that 5 FTE from a team with a similar skills mix to XST+SP would launch roughly 2 new projects per year.</li><li>XST will now look into other ways to support high-priority projects such as in-housing them, rather than pursuing incubation and looking for external founders by default, while the team considers its next steps.</li><li>Reasons for the shift include: an unfavourable funding environment, a focus on the AI x-risk space narrowing the founder pool and making it harder to find suitable project ideas, and challenges finding very talented founders in general.</li><li>I think the ideal team working in this space has: lots of prior incubation experience, significant x-risk expertise and connections, excellent access to funding and ability to identify top founder talent, and very strong conviction.&nbsp;</li><li>I\u2019d often suggest getting more experience founding stuff yourself rather than starting an incubator \u2013 and I think funding conditions for AI x-risk incubation will be more favourable in 1-2 years.</li><li>There are many approaches to AI x-risk incubation that seem promising to me that we didn\u2019t try, including cohort-based Charity Entrepreneurship-style programs, a high-touch approach to finding founders, and a founder in residence program.</li></ul><h2>Summary of inputs and outcomes</h2><h3>Inputs</h3><p>Between April 1st and December 1st 2023, Rethink Priorities dedicated approximately 2.5 full-time equivalent (FTE) years of labour towards incubating projects aiming to reduce existential risk from AI. XST had 4 full-time team members working on incubating AI x-risk projects during this period,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefs0gphldx8\"><sup><a href=\"#fns0gphldx8\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;and from August 1st to December 1st 2023, roughly one FTE from SP collaborated with XST to identify and support potential founders for a particular project.</p><p>In this period, XST also devoted roughly 0.4 FTE-years working directly on an impactful project in the AI advocacy space that stemmed from our incubation work.</p><p>The people working on this were generalist and relatively junior, with 1-5 years\u2019 experience in x-risk-related work (and 0-10 years\u2019 experience in other areas). Team members previously cofounded&nbsp;<a href=\"https://condor.camp/en/\"><u>Condor Camp</u></a> and EA Pathfinder (later&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.successif.org/\"><u>Successif</u></a>), and the team reported to Peter Wildeford who has significant experience starting impactful non-profits, including Rethink Priorities itself.</p><p>The main costs were the costs of employing the staff and the cost of a small starting pot (approx. $65k) for a project we plan to launch in early 2024.</p><h3>Approach</h3><p>The core model we used for incubating projects to tackle AI x-risk involved 3 stages:</p><ol><li><strong>Project research:</strong> Solicit and prioritise among ideas, investigate the most promising ones, and write project memos for the ideas that seem above the bar for us working to help launch them.</li><li><strong>Founder search and vetting:</strong> For each project we want to help launch, identify highly capable founders to take the project on.</li><li><strong>Founder support:</strong> Support each founding team as they begin to launch their project.</li></ol><p>In practice, stages 1 and 2 tended to blend together, with the first stages of founder search for a given project often involving further investigation of the project itself. We made an initial longlist of around 300 project ideas, and seriously considered 19 of these ideas (stage 1), took 4 ideas to founder search (stage 2), and XST and SP will be doing founder support for 1 founder team from the start of January (stage 3).</p><h3>Main outcomes</h3><p>The most important outcome of our work is that we\u2019ll soon launch a project equipping talented university students interested in mitigating extreme AI risks with the skills and background to enter a US policy career, with a founding team due to start work at the start of January.</p><p>An additional major outcome is that we had a positive effect on AI advocacy efforts through our direct work on an AI advocacy project, which we began working on as a result of our incubation work.</p><p>We also published&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/longtermism-research-notes/concrete-projects-for-reducing-existential-risk\"><u>a list of project ideas</u></a><u>,</u> and wrote a <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/longtermism-research-notes/project-proposal-scenario-analysis-group\">project proposal</a> for an AI crisis planning group. Additionally, we plan to publish a proposal for a project to attract legal talent to AI governance and policy work soon.</p><h3>Implied forward-looking cost-effectiveness</h3><p>A very rough estimate based on our inputs and outputs suggests that 5 FTE from a team with a similar skills mix to XST+SP would launch roughly 2 new projects per year.</p><h2>Updated plans</h2><p>Despite this progress, we\u2019re shifting away from incubation.&nbsp;XST will now look into other ways to support high-priority projects such as in-housing them, rather than pursuing incubation and looking for external founders by default, while the team reconsiders its next steps.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyatvpggaqf\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyatvpggaqf\">[3]</a></sup></span></p><h2>Reasoning for shifting away from incubation</h2><p>Our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/longtermism-research-notes/the-rethink-priorities-existential-security-teams-strategy-for-2023\"><u>original plans set out earlier this year</u></a> aimed to launch one new promising project by the end of October \u2013 we\u2019ll very likely have achieved this, albeit a couple of months late, by early January. We ended up deprioritising or being behind on the other goals stated in that post, but I think these goals were quite ambitious and I think our rate of progress is only a small-to-moderate negative update on our ability to execute on the kind of incubation strategy we\u2019ve followed this year.</p><p>Still, XST is moving away from that approach. In my view, the three most important considerations in favour of this move are:</p><ol><li>The funding landscape was much less favourable than we expected, even after accounting for changes since mid 2022.</li><li>AI x-risk work seems highest priority, but it\u2019s harder to incubate projects in this area, especially for a generalist team, relative to other x-risk related areas.</li><li>The founder pool is somewhat less strong than we expected.</li></ol><p>I go into more detail on these in subsequent subsections.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefa3eh44hq5i4\"><sup><a href=\"#fna3eh44hq5i4\">[4]</a></sup></span></p><h3>Difficult funding environment</h3><p>The funding landscape for x-risk-focused projects is currently significantly more challenging than I imagined, even after accounting for changes since mid 2022. Most importantly, the general bar for funding is higher than I expected, and funders are significantly more skeptical about incubation in particular than I realised.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefswn643mq6a\"><sup><a href=\"#fnswn643mq6a\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Funding application turnaround times from major x-risk funders are also significantly longer on average than I expected.</p><p>This updated understanding of the funding environment has several important implications, each of which reduce the expected impact of continuing our incubation work, in my view:</p><ul><li>Most importantly, creating new projects seems less valuable \u2013 from a community perspective, adding projects makes more sense when there\u2019s plenty of funding to go around, and looks less valuable when funding is tight. Long funding application turnaround times also seem challenging for early-stage projects.</li><li>It currently seems very difficult to get funding to run structured programmes, such as founder in residence programmes, or to otherwise give potential founders substantial financial stability, which I\u2019d seen as an important potential path to impact for our incubation work.</li><li>Funding to engage contractors or bring in new hires to add valuable incubation or entrepreneurship experience seems hard to come by.</li><li>It\u2019s dramatically harder for us to get additional funding to continue work on incubation than I expected (though it\u2019s certainly not the case that we exhausted all avenues for funding our work on incubation before deciding to pivot). This means more time and energy on fundraising, more planning uncertainty, and potentially needing to shut down the project when we\u2019d expect to have a higher impact by continuing.</li></ul><h3>AI x-risk projects seem highest priority, but harder for us to incubate</h3><p>A couple of months into our work, we decided to narrow our focus from x-risk projects focused on any cause area to projects focused specifically on x-risk from AI, in light of the apparent increased tractability of AI x-risk work due to increased public awareness of AI risk.</p><p>I think this focus on AI specifically was a good decision, but it felt harder for us to incubate projects in this area.</p><ul><li>Projects in this area tended to more often have the following features, which narrowed the pool of potential founders: i) neither product-based nor providing short feedback loops, making traditional entrepreneurship experience less relevant, ii) founders need significant domain (AI x-risk) knowledge and network to execute well, iii) founders need a strong motivation to reduce extreme risks (from AI), because of the projects\u2019 unusually high potential to be net harmful.</li><li>In particular, one potential founder group we were initially interested in targeting was people with significant entrepreneurial experience but little prior exposure to EA, and this group seems significantly less suited to the kinds of projects described in the previous bullet point.</li><li>We often seemed to be considering projects that didn\u2019t really need \u201cincubating\u201d, as opposed to convincing an existing team or org to work on them (e.g. a new research agenda), and this felt like a feature of the AI x-risk space.</li><li>We\u2019re somewhat hampered by having weaker AI x-risk knowledge, relative to our knowledge relevant for, say, civilisational resilience projects, compared to the rest of the x-risk ecosystem.</li></ul><h3>Less strong founder pool</h3><p>I updated negatively on the availability of a founder pool that could successfully execute on projects we\u2019d want to launch. For the project we did our most significant founder search for, we didn\u2019t find many candidates with the key skills we\u2019d ideally want, such as significant knowledge of US policy careers. In addition, potential founder sources like 80,000 Hours seemed to generally have fewer compelling leads than I expected, and I also slightly increased my estimate of how hard successfully launching an AI x-risk project is on average.&nbsp;</p><p>Note that I feel especially low-confidence about my assessments in this area \u2013 I still feel a high degree of uncertainty about the strength of the founder pool for x-risk projects. We only conducted a full, formal founder search process for one project, and weren\u2019t able to offer the founders significant financial security, which might deter some of the most experienced potential candidates.</p><h2>Some scattered thoughts relevant for people considering incubating x-risk projects</h2><p>I\u2019ll end by providing some scattered thoughts and advice for people considering incubating x-risk projects.</p><p>I\u2019d say that the&nbsp;<i>ideal</i> team working on x-risk incubation would have these traits (though I don\u2019t think all this is necessary!):</p><ul><li>Lots of incubation experience and/or experience starting and growing multiple successful projects.</li><li>Significant expertise and good connections in the EA/x-risk space, and more narrowly in the area you want to incubate projects for \u2013 e.g. you\u2019re able to generate (rather than just solicit) high quality project ideas in that area.</li><li>Excellent ability to provide funding to potential founders, e.g. by having strong buy-in from well-resourced funders of x-risk projects.</li><li>Excellent ability to attract and vet top founder talent.</li><li>Having a strong conviction in x-risk incubation seems very beneficial \u2013 you will likely encounter significant skepticism at times and being resilient to this seems important.</li></ul><p>If you\u2019re thinking about starting an incubator, I\u2019d often suggest considering getting (more) experience founding stuff yourself first. This brings many benefits:</p><ul><li>With more experience, it\u2019s easier to give advice and make good calls, and generally give great support to founders you\u2019re incubating.</li><li>It\u2019s easier to attract quality founders if you have a(n extensive) track record of your own.</li><li>Having a more substantial track record seems helpful for getting funding.</li><li>Getting experience founding stuff yourself might also be a way to get more object-level expertise.</li></ul><p>Note that I expect that the funding landscape for projects tackling AI x-risk will improve significantly in roughly 1-2 years -- so being positioned to start spinning out AI x-risk-related orgs at that time could be pretty great. For a team thinking about starting an AI x-risk incubator right now, this also pushes in favour of spending time getting more experience founding stuff first.</p><p>Note also that there are some incubation approaches we might have tried but didn\u2019t. These all seem potentially promising to me to test out in the AI x-risk space:</p><ul><li>Outreach to more traditional entrepreneurs, attempting to bridge the EA vs traditional entrepreneurship cultural divide.</li><li>Charity Entrepreneurship-style incubation programs involving cohorts who are provided with training and opportunities to test fit with many potential cofounders.</li><li>A high-touch founder search approach, where a lot of effort is made to connect with and pitch a project idea to particularly promising potential founders.</li><li>A concerted effort to seek very promising founders and tailor project proposals around them.</li><li>A \"founders in residence\" program, where a potential founder is given a 12 month contract and given space to explore a promising area, develop project ideas, and eventually launch an impactful project.</li></ul><p>Finally, I\u2019ll quickly list some updates I made from our incubation work this year that I didn\u2019t already cover:</p><ul><li>We were surprised at least once by how crowded by existing actors and projects an area was, even after we thought we\u2019d done a fairly thorough initial investigation that suggested a significant gap. So I've updated towards expecting these sorts of areas to be less neglected than expected.</li><li>It now feels to me like the systematic, weighted-factor-model approach we used for project research wasn't the best choice.<ul><li>I think that something more focused on getting and really understanding the views of central AI x-risk people would have been better.</li><li>Another promising approach might be building deep domain-specific knowledge and network (for example in US AI x-risk policy) as a first step before diving into specific project ideas.</li></ul></li><li>I updated slightly towards there being opportunities to help existing \"EA founders\".&nbsp;<ul><li>We had requests for help from several exciting potential founders who were already well integrated into the EA/x-risk ecosystem, despite not making any efforts to solicit these.</li><li>We weren\u2019t able to offer them much help. But we didn\u2019t try very hard, and maybe there\u2019s something valuable here that could be explored.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Closing</h2><p>If you\u2019re interested in working on incubating x-risk projects, I might be able to share more detailed internal retrospectives.

He starts from the premise that the FDA deserves destruction but cautions against rash action. No political slogan can be implemented without clarification and \u201cAbolish the FDA\u201d is no different, but Scott\u2019s objections aren\u2019t strong reasons to stop short of a policy implementation that still retains the spirit behind the slogan.</p><p>Scott\u2019s preferred proposal is to essentially keep the authority and structure of the FDA the same but expand the definition of supplements and experimental drugs. This way, fewer drugs are illegal but there aren\u2019t big ripple effects on the prescription and health insurance systems that we have to worry about.</p><p>The more hardline libertarian proposal is to restrict the FDA\u2019s mandatory authority to labeling and make their efficacy testing completely non-binding. This would turn the FDA into a informational consumer protection agency rather than a drug regulator. They can slap big red labels on non-FDA approved drugs and invite companies to run efficacy tests to get nice green labels instead, but they can\u2019t prevent anyone from taking a drug if they want it.</p><p>Let\u2019s go through Scott\u2019s objections to the hardline plan and see if they give good reasons to favor one over the other.</p><h2>Are we also eliminating the concept of prescription medication?</h2><p>I can see some \u201cIf I were king of the world\u201d overhauls to the health system that might do away with mandatory prescriptions, but I think the point of this exercise is to see if we can abolish the FDA without changing anything else and still come out ahead, accounting for costly second-order effects from the rest of the messed up health system. So no, the hardline \u201cabolish the FDA\u201d plan would not remove the legal barrier of prescription. Here is Scott\u2019s response:</p><blockquote><p>But if we <i>don\u2019t</i> eliminate prescriptions, how do you protect prescribers from liability? Even the best medications sometimes cause catastrophic side effects. Right now your doctor doesn\u2019t worry you\u2019ll sue them, because \u201cthe medication was FDA-approved\u201d is a strong defense against liability. But if there are thousands of medications out there, from miraculous panaceas to bleach-mixed-with-snake-venom, then it becomes your doctor\u2019s responsibility to decide which are safe-and-effective vs. dangerous-and-useless. And rather than take that responsibility and get sued, your doctor will prefer to play it safe and only use medications that everyone else uses, or that were used before the FDA was abolished. You might even find it\u2019s even harder to get a medication into common use than it was back when the FDA existed!</p></blockquote><p>This is a reasonable concern, litigation pressure is a common culprit behind <a href=\"https://maximumprogress.substack.com/p/why-did-nepa-peak-in-2016\"><u>spiraling regulatory burden</u></a>. But in this case we can be confident that turning the FDA into a non-binding informational board won\u2019t turn prescriptions into an even higher legal hurdle because doctors already prescribe far outside of FDA approval.</p><p>When a drug is tested by the FDA it is tested as a treatment for a specific condition, like diabetes or throat cancer. If the drug is approved, it is approved only for the outcome measured in efficacy testing and nothing else. However, doctors know that certain drugs approved for one thing are effective at treating others. So they can issue an \u201coff-label\u201d prescription based on their professional opinion. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Off-label_use#Frequency_of_off-label_use\"><u>Perhaps 20% of all prescriptions in the US are made off-label</u></a> and more than half of doctors make some off label prescriptions.</p><p>So doctors are clearly willing to leave the legal umbrella of FDA approval when they make prescription decisions. There are lots of high profile legal cases about off-label prescriptions but they are mostly about marketing and they haven\u2019t dampened doctor\u2019s participation in the practice. If doctors were comfortable enough to <a href=\"https://slatestarcodex.com/2019/03/11/ketamine-now-by-prescription/\"><u>prescribe ketamine to treat depression</u></a> even though the FDA had never tested or approved it as a psychiatric drug, we shouldn\u2019t worry too much about them shying away from using drugs that they believe are effective in a system where the FDA's role is minimized.</p><p>Thousands of doctors already rely on their personal judgement of the evidence when deciding what medicines to prescribe. The choice between Scott\u2019s plan and the hardline libertarian one doesn\u2019t change this, but making the FDA non-binding comes with lots of extra benefits from making pharmaceutical markets cheaper, more innovative, and more open.</p><h2>How do we deal with the fact that many doctors are dumb?</h2><p>Next, Scott has some concerns about principal-agent problems between patients and their doctors.</p><blockquote><p>Suppose GoodCorp puts a lot of effort into making (let\u2019s say) a revolutionary new Alzheimers drug that really works. They conduct a great study, and get it certified by whatever voluntary certifying organization replaces the FDA. Their drug costs $10,000.</p><p>BadCorp takes whatever was in their fridge, blends it together, calls it \u201ca revolutionary new Alzheimers drug\u201d, conducts a bad study which they manipulate, and does a great advertising blitz. Their drug costs $50. Which one does your doctor prescribe you?</p><p>I don\u2019t know: which company has more attractive sales reps distributing pens? Which pens are nicer and shinier?</p></blockquote><p>Aligning the incentives of doctors and their patients is a real and difficult problem, but Scott makes no argument for why the FDA is in a better position to care about patient\u2019s interests than doctors are. The FDA\u2019s betrayal of patient interests looks different but it is no less damaging.</p><p>GoodCorp puts a lot of effort into making a revolutionary new vaccine that is good enough to stop a global pandemic if it is rolled out in time. They send the FDA all of their data, but its Friday afternoon and a long weekend is coming up and it might look bad if they approve this vaccine too fast anyways. Maybe they should just push the meeting back a few weeks. Perhaps doctors prescribe too many of the bad drugs but the FDA approves too few of the good ones. The optimal amount of mis-prescribed medicine is not zero.</p><p>Scott makes no attempt to quantify which of these effects is more important, but here is mine:</p><p><a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/bdrc.21096#bdrc21096-bib-1004\"><u>The \u201cbiggest man-made medical disaster</u></a>\u201d ever was the widespread prescription of the nausea drug Thalidomide for morning sickness. The drug caused horrible birth defects in the children of the pregnant women who took it. Ten thousand children were affected around the world, but the medicine was not approved in the US because of a stern FDA regulator. Dr. Francis Kelsey received the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service for her decision not to approve the drug.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F9ba7c723-b584-4118-9996-6a514ec40933_1182x1536.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BZaycPXEbxHhEssmT/olutlwoluxgh6umlzboj\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BZaycPXEbxHhEssmT/ejbsmt6vz0g8qhvh0xde 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BZaycPXEbxHhEssmT/bso0kc0dj4werxz2gcyn 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BZaycPXEbxHhEssmT/kgkeaoahu4que259u9jm 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/BZaycPXEbxHhEssmT/olutlwoluxgh6umlzboj 1456w\"></a></p><p>The FDA approved the first Covid-19 vaccines for use on December 11th 2020. Pfizer submitted their emergency use authorization request on Friday, November 20th. If they FDA had rushed to review their request over the weekend and approved the vaccine on Monday instead of waiting 3 weeks, <a href=\"https://maximumprogress.substack.com/p/how-many-people-are-in-the-invisible-graveyard\"><u>they could have saved at least 10,000 lives</u></a>. Of course, accelerations of approval far more than 3 weeks were completely feasible as well.</p><p>So already, the biggest man-made medical disaster ever committed is outgunned by completely standard disasters of omission at the FDA. This isn\u2019t an exhaustive quantification but I think it is a convincing case that while dumb, misaligned doctors are a problem, an even dumber and even more misaligned FDA is not the right solution.</p><p>Scott\u2019s plan of opening up the supplements category to any safe-to-ingest chemical doesn\u2019t really solve the dumb doctor problem. It just maintains the separation between the ultra-conservative set of FDA approved drugs from the wild-west off-labels and supplements with an extremely expensive regulatory authority that likely kills thousands with its drags on medical costs and innovation. The \u201cabolish the FDA\u201d plan also has this separation if patients want it, but its enforced by what gets green labels rather than what is allowed on the shelves at all.</p><h2>How will the smart doctors get the data they need?</h2><blockquote><p>Maybe your doctor isn\u2019t dumb. Maybe they could look over the studies themselves just as well as the FDA can. That doesn\u2019t help, because without the FDA, the studies won\u2019t be done.</p></blockquote><p>Here again we can look to the extremely common practice of off label prescriptions. Scott has probably written some of these himself, e.g prescribing an anti-depressant to someone with anxiety. To get the data he probably read a bunch of academic papers and looked at non-FDA RCTs.</p><p>Also, the FDA does not need to be a binding regulatory authority to produce data on the efficacy of drugs. The FDA could take a more consumer activist role and observe what people are using and then go out and test them themselves without forcing anyone else to wait on them. We could also just take their budget and use it to fund a bunch of NIH clinical trials each year.</p><h2>What would insurance cover?</h2><blockquote><p>Right now (to vastly oversimplify) insurances have to cover all FDA-approved medications if patients can prove they really need them (insurances are allowed to make the proving process inconvenient, which is how they gate access in practice). Insurances don\u2019t have to cover any non-FDA-approved treatments, and often don\u2019t.</p></blockquote><p>This is probably where the second order effects of reforming or abolishing the FDA are largest, but it still isn\u2019t a great argument for Scott\u2019s plan over mine. A non-binding informational FDA could still decide which drugs are required to be covered by insurance. This obviously grants a lot of power back to the FDA, but at least in a non-binding world drugs can be produced much cheaper, so health insurance is less necessary to pay for them. In Scott\u2019s plan the FDA retains the mandatory insurance power and new drugs are even less likely to be covered by insurance as supplements.</p><p>Without making any big changes to healthcare governance outside of the FDA, we could also just move the authority to decide what gets mandatory coverage to some other branch of the Department of Health and Human Services and remove the explicit link between the FDA\u2019s greenlight and mandatory coverage.</p><p>The health insurance system is full of bad incentives. Neither plan fixes these but neither one makes them worse. Again, at least in the libertarian world drugs are cheap and new ones come out quicker.</p><h2>What would a practical abolish-the-FDA<s>-lite</s> policy proposal look like?</h2><p>Completely remove efficacy testing requirements, making the FDA a non-binding consumer protection and labeling agency. Pharmaceutical manufactures can go through the FDA testing process and get the official \u201capproved\u2019 label if insurers, doctors, or patients demand it, but its not necessary to sell their treatment.</p><p>This would let doctors use the tools they already have to determine the effectiveness of a drug for a certain condition, even when it is not FDA approved. It would let patients choose their own risk profile when deciding personal issues of life and death. It would bring the cost of drugs down as not every new drug is saddled with billions of dollars of bureaucratic compliance costs. It would quicken the pace of drug discovery and medical innovation. It would improve our pandemic response times.</p><p>The problems of doctor fallibility and insurance coverage are problems in both plans, but only one gets the full benefits of an open, rapid, and cheap market for pharmaceuticals.</p><p>Scott\u2019s proposal is reasonable and would be an improvement over the status quo, but it\u2019s not better than the more hardline proposal to strip the FDA of its regulatory powers.</p><hr><p><i>The very last sentence of the essay mentions the feasibility of actually passing these reforms politically, but it\u2019s not a focus elsewhere and feels to me like a separate issue so I don\u2019t consider it here.</i></p>", "user": {"username": "Maxwell Tabarrok"}}, {"_id": "Jt7p4JcbmiunZwsh6", "title": "Announcing Surveys on Community Health, Causes, and Harassment", "postedAt": "2023-12-15T11:46:58.510Z", "htmlBody": "<p>We are announcing a supplementary survey to gather timely information from the EA community before the next EA Survey in 2024.</p><p>This survey will contain questions related to:</p><ol><li>Community health and satisfaction with the EA community</li><li>Cause prioritization and how EA resources should be allocated</li><li>Demographics (which can optionally be skipped if you provided your email address last time and opt for us to link your responses)</li></ol><p>We are also sending out a separate survey, requested by CEA\u2019s Community Health and Special Projects team, focusing primarily on sexual harassment and gender-related experiences:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 4.

On hot days children sometimes play in the pond which is only about knee deep. The weather\u2019s cool today, though, and the hour is early, so you are surprised to see <strong>1 million</strong> children splashing about in the pond.&nbsp;</p><p>As you get closer you see that these are very young children, just toddlers who are flailing about, unable to stay upright or walk out of the pond. As you look around you see a few other bystanders entering the pond to save children however most people seem to notice the children but continue on their way to work.&nbsp;</p><p>You then notice that as some children are being rescued from the pond more children are in fact still entering &nbsp;the pond and beginning to drown.&nbsp;</p><p>To complicate matters; on the other side of the path you see work is beginning on building a pond 10 times larger. Which would pose a far greater risk to children drowning in the future (representing <strong>long term existential risk</strong>).&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore this is the route you take to work every day and you will now be faced with this scenario <strong>every morning.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>You are now presented with enormous moral pressure;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Should you disregard your obligations at work, enter the pond and from this day forth devote yourself entirely to rescuing children?&nbsp;</p><p>Should you <strong>sacrifice 10%</strong> of your work day each day by stopping at the pond for 45 Minutes in the morning and rescuing children?&nbsp;</p><p>Should you instead devote that time to <strong>increasing the chance</strong> that the larger pond is either not built or if built at least has some safety measures in place?&nbsp;</p><p>Or should you take a different route to work in the morning?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The original thought experiment as far as I understand was designed to explain why geographical distance should not impact moral obligation. &nbsp;I suppose this is more concerned with the enormous &amp; unending moral implications of EA.&nbsp;</p><p>For me when I think of the drowning child thought experiment in this way, I feel that for the person walking to work every morning it seems reasonable that they would quickly become extremely aggrieved to exist in such a world.&nbsp;</p><p>But I wonder if its possible to not consider this persons situation to be a burden but to instead be an opportunity to save lives daily?&nbsp;</p><p>Is it possible for them to be grateful to have the opportunity to devote themselves to something profoundly meaningful and good?&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Either way Im very new here and have very little knowledge of philosophy so please excuse my ignorance and poor writing but I would love to have some more in depth conversations around the moral impact of EA .</p>", "user": {"username": "Lachlan Earnshaw"}}, {"_id": "fCcScg735AfvuC3xg", "title": "Risk Aversion in Wild Animal Welfare", "postedAt": "2023-12-14T17:07:46.926Z", "htmlBody": "<h2>Executive Summary</h2><ol><li>Wild animals outnumber humans and captive animals by orders of magnitude. Hence, scalable interventions to improve the welfare of wild animals could have greater expected value than interventions on behalf of other groups.</li><li>Yet, wild animals receive only a small share of resources earmarked for animal welfare causes. This may be because animal advocates are uncomfortable with relying on expected value maximization alone in a field beset by \"complex cluelessness\": There are compelling reasons for <i>and</i> against wild animal interventions, and none are clearly decisive.<ol><li>Reducing populations of fast life history strategists would likely reduce suffering. However, there is also reason to suspect fast life history strategists have enough rewarding experiences to increase aggregate welfare.</li><li>Eliminating fundamental sources of suffering in natural habitats would reduce suffering. However, it could also differentially benefit species that many people believe have systematically worse lives.</li><li>Prioritizing the most abundant groups of wild animals could generate the largest increases in aggregate welfare. However, the most abundant wild animals have relatively low and vague probabilities of sentience.</li></ol></li><li>Regardless of risk attitudes, inaction on wild animal welfare is difficult to justify.<ol><li>There are no areas of animal welfare with a larger scale.</li><li>Even if the aggregate welfare of wild animals is net-positive, it is nevertheless almost certainly suboptimal.</li></ol></li><li>By accounting for considerations that decision-makers believe are relevant, incorporating risk aversion into expected value calculations may increase willingness to commit resources to wild animal welfare. Different types of risk aversion account for different types of uncertainty.<ol><li><i>Outcome</i> risk aversion gives special consideration to avoiding worst-case scenarios.</li><li><i>Difference-making </i>risk aversion gives special consideration to ensuring that actions improve upon the status quo.</li><li><i>Ambiguity</i> aversion gives special consideration to reducing ignorance and choosing actions that have predictable outcomes.</li></ol></li><li>Different types of risk often disagree in their recommendations. A corollary is that robustness across different types of risk aversion increases choiceworthiness.<ol><li>Interventions that reduce suffering without altering the number or composition of wild animals have a greater probability of robustness to different types of risk aversion.</li><li>Outcome risk aversion favors abundant groups of wild animals, while difference-making risk aversion favors wild animals who have a high probability of sentience.</li><li>Ambiguity aversion is favorable towards research on wild animal welfare, whereas outcome and difference-making risk aversion only favor it under certain conditions.</li></ol></li><li>Risk aversion does not robustly favor farmed over wild animals or vice versa.<ol><li>Outcome risk aversion prioritizes wild animals due to their abundance.</li><li>Difference-making risk aversion favors farmed animals. However, it also favors some diversification across types of animals.</li><li>Ambiguity aversion favors helping farmed animals over wild animals, and basic research to help both groups.</li></ol></li><li>Although complex cluelessness affects many domains, wild animal welfare may be a particularly high-stakes example of it. Alternatively, moral uncertainty about the permissibility of interfering with nature may explain a reluctance to act on uncertain evidence.</li></ol><p><strong>Read the full report on Rethink Priorities' </strong><a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/risk-aversion-in-wild-animal-welfare\"><strong>website</strong></a><strong> or </strong><a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/s/WAW-risk-aversion.pdf\"><strong>download the pdf</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><h1>Acknowledgments</h1><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img style=\"width:498.075px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/hlzmenkzpp9wlfrmdxl5\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/kjxrg9pgvbmkbm85wvaj 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/ngsrw3pkqul5mp7exjto 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/hhenbppxpatorubxclek 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/dg5jglstgwcjgovqapwp 750w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/j35vsilh7znkynx2hudy 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/fqzo8perrc9znymjvss7 1500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/u6iugrgh2mnodxce02hx 2500w\"></p><p>The post was written by William McAuliffe.

This is far from a complete list, and I welcome ideas and feedback. Also, if anyone wants to or is working on any of these ideas, I\u2019d be happy to support in any way I can!</p><h2><strong>Context</strong></h2><p>I'm Eric, formerly co-founder of RippleMatch, an AI recruiting company with ~$80M raised, millions of users, and ~10% of the Fortune 500 as customers. I made the difficult decision to leave RippleMatch this year because I'm concerned about catastrophic risk from AI, and have been spending the last year thinking about ways to help. Given my background, I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about for-profit ideas to help with alignment \u2013 many that can be VC-backed. Some of these ideas speak more directly to reducing catastrophic risk than others, but I think that all can put a founder in a strong position to help in the future.</p><h2><strong>Why I believe for-profit alignment orgs are valuable</strong></h2><p>I don\u2019t think for-profit approaches are inherently better than building non-profits, pursuing government regulation, or other approaches, but I think that for-profit orgs can make a substantial impact while attracting a different pool of talent eager to work on the problem.</p><p>With VC dollars, a for-profit organization can potentially scale far more quickly than a non-profit. It could make a huge impact and not have its growth capped by donor generosity. As a result, there can be far more organizations working on safety in the ecosystem tapping into a different pool of resources. That said, any VC-backed company has a relatively low chance of success, so it\u2019s a riskier approach.</p><p>Fundamentally, I believe that risk and compliance spend will grow extremely quickly over the coming decade, scaling with generative AI revenue. With comps in finance and cybersecurity, I\u2019d guess that mid to high single digit percentages of overall AI spend will be on risk and compliance, which would suggest big businesses can be built here. Many startups tackling alignment will need to start by addressing short term safety concerns, but in doing so will position themselves to tackle long-term risks over time.</p><p>Onto the actual ideas!</p><h2><strong>Robustness approaches</strong></h2><h3><strong>Testing / benchmarking software</strong></h3><p>Test case management needs to look very different for LLMs compared to typical software. The idea is to sell companies deploying LLMs a SaaS platform with the ability to generate and manage test cases for their LLMs to make sure they are performing properly and ensure that performance doesn\u2019t drift from version to version. This startup would also incorporate a marketplace of common benchmarks that companies can pull off the shelf if relevant to their use case (e.g. common adversarial prompts).</p><p>Currently, my impression is that most companies don\u2019t use any software to manage their language model test suites, which is a problem given how often an LLM can fail to produce a good result.</p><h3><strong>Red-teaming as a service</strong></h3><p>Just as software companies penetration test their software, companies that use LLMs as well as companies who build frontier models will need to red-team their models with a wide variety of adversarial prompts. This would mostly test models for how they handle misuse and make them more robust against jailbreaking. Just as a proper penetration test employs both manual and automated penetration testing, this startup would require building / fine-tuning the best automated red-teaming LLM that likely draws on multiple frontier models, as well as employ the best manual red-teamers in the space. Enterprises would likely pay a subscription depending on their usage, which would likely be spiky.</p><p>There is a substantial appetite from labs building frontier models for red-teaming services, and it appears to me that red-teaming, evals, and data labeling sum up the services that labs are interested in at the current moment. I think that\u2019s a small market, but the dollar values could be high for each individual customer.</p><h3><strong>Evals / auditing</strong></h3><p>Lots of folks are thinking about evals right now, and I agree the theory of change is strong. Any evals business right now would face a large amount of competition from nonprofits offering services for free as well as government audits that could be mandatory.</p><p>That said, I still think there's a substantial need for companies deploying LLMs as well as labs building frontier models to be audited for a bunch of things, like dangerous capabilities, misuse, security, bias, and compliance. Given how easy it is to fine-tune RLHF safeguards from models, I think it\u2019s likely that all companies deploying frontier models, not just the model producers, will need to be audited and pay money to reduce risk.</p><p>The product will be a mix of software (think Vanta for SOC II) that tracks compliance across a number of practices that the company needs to adhere to, as well as services to audit for compliance and test for dangerous capabilities. There is a chance that the auditor (audit for compliance) and the capabilities evaluator are two separate entities, in which case I think that the auditor is more scalable and the better business, as testing for dangerous capabilities will likely be quite manual for some time.</p><h3><strong>Monitoring</strong></h3><p>There are a bunch of startups cropping up to monitor and observe language models in production, vying for what could be thought of as Datadog for LLMs. I think this is a big problem that will clearly exist as a software business, since language model monitoring is both tractable and very different than application monitoring. There are quite a few startups with ~$50M - $100M raised that were doing this for ML models in general (Arthur, Arize, etc) and have spent a bunch of time building out their services for LLMs, and this startup would also face a bunch of competition from APM companies like Datadog and New Relic who are well positioned from a customer perspective to own this space.</p><p>The product would ingest every inference / response of an LLM, make it easy to create dashboards to monitor for certain behaviors / failures, and incorporate an API that can surface problems either in dashboards or in real time escalating to humans. It would be able to measure model drift and help developers debug the behavior of their LLM application.</p><p>I think the safety case here would have some similarity to that of evals, where we may get a warning shot through monitoring of dangerous capabilities in production. Most of the behaviors that companies would monitor for would be mundane, however.</p><h2><strong>AI agents approaches</strong></h2><p>All the ideas below are a bit early given the lack of economically valuable agents that currently exist. However, I would wager that the next iteration of LLMs (e.g. GPT-5) will unlock a world of enterprise automation, as well as be able to perform basic consumer tasks like booking a flight or scheduling a dinner with friends. As soon as this is possible, companies will be incredibly incentivized to pursue these use cases because they have the potential to heavily reduce the cost of their labor. It also opens up a world of multi-agent interaction and plenty of safety problems.</p><p>I think a world where agents are widespread and performing tasks on our behalf is coming soon, so building safer agents in that world is helpful. I\u2019m also inspired by a Paul Christiano&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/fRSj2W4Fjje8rQWm9/thoughts-on-sharing-information-about-language-model\"><u>post</u></a> that discusses advancing agent capabilities as neutral / positive, and so advancing safer agents seems pretty good overall to me.</p><h3><strong>Agent testing environments</strong></h3><p>This is similar to building testing software for LLMs, but once systems become agentic / multi-step, it\u2019s even harder to build test cases. More importantly, one would likely need to be able to easily build agent environments and set them up and tear them down automatically in addition to managing test cases successfully.</p><p>This idea is a bit early because GPT-4 doesn\u2019t seem quite capable of doing the planning necessary for most economically valuable multi-step workflows, but I would wager that GPT-5 will unlock a world of enterprise automation. In that world, this type of solution would probably be necessary for all companies looking to build agents.</p><p>The primary issue here is technical \u2013 is it possible to build a solution that fits the use cases of most companies given that the environments that these agents will be expected to perform in will be incredibly diverse?</p><h3><strong>Deterministic framework for agents</strong></h3><p>One of the primary blockers to using LLMs in production is that they can have all sorts of unexpected behavior. This will only increase in worlds where agents are widespread, which will be a big problem for companies looking to deploy LM agents. The idea here is to build a developer framework that puts LM agents on heavy guardrails, strictly defining the set of actions an LM agent can take given its state and environment. This set of actions will be deterministic, well understood by the developer, easy to use, and human legible. If this becomes the de facto standard for building agents in enterprise use cases, it will be a safer future.</p><p>OpenAI\u2019s GPT framework is a potential competitor here. Building great developer frameworks for LM agents is part of their vision of the future. I think they may be optimizing first for ease of use out of the box and consumer use cases which could make them neglect some key features in a framework like this, but they pose a substantial threat to this business.</p><p>That said, interoperability is potentially quite important to companies, and building a model agnostic framework could have advantages.</p><h2><strong>Cybersecurity approaches</strong></h2><h3><strong>Security agent</strong></h3><p>As LM agents get more capable, they\u2019ll also improve their abilities to find exploits in security systems. I expect the number and quality of AI scams phishing attempts, vulnerability scans, etc to increase sharply. To combat this, everyone should have their own security agent on each of their devices. This agent will stay silent in the background, watching the user\u2019s activity, reading emails, and listening to calls until it detects a problem. Upon detection, the agent can intervene loudly by popping up a warning with advice on how to proceed or shutting off the interaction, or it can intervene softly by escalating a notice to a company\u2019s IT team.</p><p>One could also imagine consumer applications, where someone may want to ensure that grandma doesn\u2019t fall for any AI scams, so they install a security agent on her phone, escalating unsafe behavior.</p><p>Safety-wise, I think this is important because this can help labs building frontier models improve their safety practices and reduce the risk that model weights get stolen, while also helping companies that provide critical infrastructure like power be more robust against attacks.</p><h3><strong>Endpoint and application monitoring</strong></h3><p>Similarly, once LM agents get sufficiently powerful, the best way to prevent malicious usage on a website will be to have intelligent models monitor and identify harmful activity at scale. Whether it\u2019s an attacker trying to penetrate security defenses or a bot misusing a platform, language models monitoring usage logs and user mouse movements / activity could identify and quarantine harmful behavior. Bot behavior should be relatively easy to detect unless the bot has a bunch of tech that helps it evade detection.</p><h2><strong>Research approaches</strong></h2><h3><strong>Build capabilities, do research</strong></h3><p>One way to advance the state of AI safety research is to build a company focused on automating work (such as a recruiter phone screen or talk therapy) and building an organization with safety at its core like Anthropic. This only works if it\u2019s critical to do safety research to advance this organization\u2019s capabilities. For example, automating a recruiter phone screen would likely require a high degree of explainability / interpretability (especially with respect to bias) in automating a decision, and automating talk therapy would require scalable oversight research to make sure the therapist is reaching the right conclusions.</p><p>The primary concern with these types of companies is finding a space where safety research is truly linked to the success of the business.</p><h3><strong>Interpretability software</strong></h3><p>Building interpretability software that assists mechanistic interpretability research and greatly accelerates progress. Could also be sold to companies that need strong explanations for why their models are performing the way they are. This eventually may be mandated by regulation.</p><p>This would likely need to be sold as downloaded software packages, likely open source, with an open source business model charging for enterprise security, support, and services. It\u2019s quite early for interpretability research, but one would expect that as the space grows, explainability and interpretability would be increasingly important not just for alignment, but to explain model outputs, and many more researchers would need access to neural activations / interpretability techniques in order to accomplish their goals.</p><h3><strong>High quality human data labeling</strong></h3><p>Labs building frontier models currently have high demand for high quality data labelers for RLHF, and as we get into more dangerous territory and get more powerful systems, we\u2019ll need increasingly large amounts of human data labeled by people with significant expertise and from a diverse set of backgrounds. When we start getting deep into domain specific agents (like finance, health, or legal) or dangerous capabilities (bio, chemical, nuclear), we\u2019ll need experts to create examples of safe and unsafe behavior for scalable oversight and for RLHF.</p><p>This idea is to build a Scale AI competitor focused on expert data labeling, probably employing grad students with lots of context on specific fields or who have expertise in non-English languages. This may also just be an expert recruitment marketplace for data labeling rather than full service, such as GLG is for expert calls.</p><p>One thing I'm uncertain about here is how good synthetic data will be for data labeling in general. Perhaps synthetic data will replace most human generated data at some point.</p><h2><strong>Other thoughts about building a for-profit alignment org</strong></h2><p>One challenge of building any for-profit organization is aligning the mission of the organization with profit incentives. The best way to tackle this is to make sure that, as much as possible, the way that the org makes money is consistent with its mission.</p><p>With respect to governance, I believe incorporating as a public benefit corporation with the mission of building safe AI is the right move. While stronger safety-oriented governance structures may be preferable, I think the recent OpenAI debacle will make raising money and operating with a non-standard governance structure difficult \u2013 without much benefit for organizations that do not pose much catastrophic risk themselves.</p><p>Advancing safety without advancing capabilities, usability, or deployability is hard. We should advance safety alongside capabilities versus the alternative of advancing capabilities without advancing safety.</p><p>One of my core principles in thinking about the future is to approach with humility and a high degree of uncertainty as to how things will play out. I believe that there are reasons for both pessimism and optimism, and that no single person has a sure idea of how the next decade is going to unfold. Because of this uncertainty, I assume that many future scenarios will be risky to humanity, with some posing risks sooner rather than later.</p><p>I think we should build organizations that help with both fast and slow takeoffs, and unipolar and multipolar failures. The future will be surprising to us in many ways, so it\u2019s best to create organizations that can iterate quickly based on how things play out. As a result, each of these company ideas should ideally bet strongly on one thing being true, while reducing vulnerability to other factors.</p><h2><strong>Please reach out!</strong></h2><p>Thanks for reading this post. If you\u2019re someone who would like to join or start a for-profit alignment organization, please reach out! I\u2019ll be starting an organization in the new year and looking to hire around April, and there are a few organizations popping up looking to fund these types of orgs and support folks making a career transition.</p>", "user": {"username": "eh42"}}, {"_id": "8DYebF3XBccHvttSn", "title": "Welfare considerations for farmed shrimp", "postedAt": "2023-12-14T17:55:45.417Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>Citation: </strong>McKay, H., McAuliffe, W., Waldhorn, D.

While there is uncertainty about whether shrimp are sentient (<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.51291/2377-7478.1691\">Crump et al., 2022</a>), the Animal Sentience Precautionary Principle suggests that we should not postpone helping shrimp if there are \u201cthreats of serious, negative animal welfare outcomes\u201d (<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.51291/2377-7478.1200\">Birch, 2017, p. 3</a>). To better understand if such outcomes do threaten shrimp, our first report estimated the scale of shrimp farming. We estimated that approximately 230 billion shrimp are alive on farms at any one time, more than any other farmed animal (<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/b8n3t\">Waldhorn &amp; Autric, 2023</a>).</p><p>However, just because the scale of shrimp farming is so comparatively large does not necessarily mean that it causes more suffering than other sectors. To understand if shrimp experience negative welfare, we reviewed academic and gray literature and consulted several shrimp aquaculture experts to describe the welfare threats a farmed shrimp may face from hatching to slaughter.</p><p><strong>Key takeaways include:</strong></p><ul><li>If they are sentient, <strong>shrimp face several welfare threats</strong>. Diseases preoccupy farmers the most, but they are often a downstream consequence of other issues, such as poor water quality. Some issues affect all shrimp for most of their lives, such as a lack of substrate, whereas others only affect subpopulations, such as eyestalk ablation of female breeders. Shrimp are particularly vulnerable during harvest and slaughter, where they endure oxidative stress and can be crushed by other shrimp.</li><li><strong>The prevalence of welfare threats varies widely across farms with different production practices</strong>. As farm intensity increases, the rearing environment resembles that of a wild shrimp less and less. Welfare issues on so-called \"extensive\" farms result from an inability to address threats to shrimp welfare. In contrast, \"intensive\" farms can mitigate problems that are common on extensive farms but must confront the novel issues introduced by high stocking densities. Many solutions cause problems of their own, and some of the issues are likely not solvable without lowering stocking densities.</li><li>We have several knowledge gaps due to the limitations of current research. In particular:<ul><li><strong>We know very little about shrimp behavior and preferences</strong>. For example, we are unsure whether shrimp can comfortably crowd, so we cannot easily infer how bad high stocking densities are for their welfare.</li><li><strong>There are few surveys of shrimp farming practices and those that exist have several limitations. </strong>The heterogeneity of shrimp farming means it is difficult to draw conclusions about the industry from existing surveys.</li></ul></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"table\"><table style=\"background-color:#efefef\"><tbody><tr><th style=\"background-color:#efefef\"><p><strong>Box 1: Shrimp aquaculture terminology</strong></p><p>The terms \u2018shrimp\u2019 and \u2018prawn\u2019 are often used interchangeably. The two terms do not reliably track any phylogenetic differences between species. Here, we use only the term \u201cshrimp\u201d, covering both shrimp and prawns. Note that members of the family <i>Artemiidae</i> are commonly referred to as \"brine shrimp\" but are not decapods and so are beyond the present scope.</p><p>We opt for the use of <i>Penaues vannamei</i> over <i>Litopenaeus vannamei</i> (to which this species is often referred), due to recognition of the former but not the latter nomenclature by <a href=\"https://www.itis.gov/servlet/SingleRpt/SingleRpt?search_topic=TSN&amp;search_value=95646#null\">ITIS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&amp;id=377748\">WorMS</a>, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/fishery/en/species/3404\">ASFIS List of Species for Fishery Statistics Purposes</a>.</p><p>The shrimp farming industry uses many terms usually associated with agriculture\u2014for example, \u2018crops\u2019 for a group of shrimp reared together, \u2018seed\u2019 for the first shrimp stocked into a pond, and \u2018harvest\u2019 for collecting and slaughtering shrimp. For clarity, we broadly conform to this terminology. Although we acknowledge animal welfare advocates may prefer terminology that does not euphemize or sanitize the experience of farmed shrimp, here we favor ensuring readability for a wide audience.</p></th></tr></tbody></table></figure><h2>Introduction</h2><h3>Should farmed shrimp receive protection as a precautionary measure?</h3><p>Although calls to improve the welfare of farmed animals have increased in recent decades (e.g., <a href=\"https://perma.cc/4PXV-P9CR\">European Commission, 2023</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fanim.2022.960379\">Sinclair et al., 2022</a>), the needs of farmed shrimp (see Box 1) in particular have only barely begun to receive attention (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ani13050807\">Pedrazzani et al., 2023</a>). Only sentient animals can suffer, so this apparent oversight may be due to uncertainty about whether shrimp are sentient. Regrettably, existing empirical evidence does not provide a decisive answer (see Box 2). In the interim, there is a need for guidance on how much attention to give shrimp welfare. The Animal Sentience Precautionary Principle states that when there is a risk of \"<i>serious</i>, <i>negative</i> animal welfare outcomes, lack of full scientific certainty as to the sentience of the animals in question shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent those outcomes\" (<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.51291/2377-7478.1200\">Birch, 2017, p. 3</a>; emphasis ours).</p><p>The number of individuals affected is one measure of how <i>serious </i>negative animal welfare outcomes would be (<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.51291/2377-7478.1200\">Birch, 2017, p. 4</a>). On this metric, shrimp aquaculture certainly qualifies as serious: the first report of the Shrimp Welfare Sequence estimates that there are more shrimp alive on farms at any time than any other farmed animal (~230 billion; <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/b8n3t\">Waldhorn &amp; Autric, 2023</a>). But how often do farmed shrimp face the <i>negative</i> outcomes required to invoke the Animal Sentience Precautionary Principle? To find out, this report describes the rearing conditions and slaughter of farmed decapod shrimp, focusing on the most commonly farmed marine (viz., <i>Penaeus vannamei</i> and <i>Penaeus monodon</i>) and freshwater species (viz., <i>Macrobrachium rosenbergii</i>).</p><figure class=\"table\"><table style=\"background-color:#efefef\"><tbody><tr><th style=\"background-color:#efefef\"><p><strong>Box 2: Shrimp sentience research</strong></p><p>Sentience refers to the capacity for valenced (i.e., positive or negative) experiences. Experiences cannot be directly observed, and so evidence of shrimp sentience can only be inferred based on physiological and behavioral evidence. Researchers have reported three types of empirical evidence that shrimp can feel pain:</p><ol><li>Nociception: Nociception refers to physiological processes that respond specifically to noxious stimuli. For example, shrimp will reflexively flick their tail to escape various threats (<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/doi.org/10.1242/jeb.201.11.1771\">Arnott et al., 1998</a>). However, this and some other nociceptive behaviors may be entirely reflexive (<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.3390/ani8090158\">Weineck et al., 2018)</a>, meaning they do not require the central processing presumably responsible for valenced experiences.</li><li>Coordinated responses to threats: To provide evidence of conscious pain, researchers must demonstrate that shrimp respond to nociception in a coordinated way. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.07.004\">Barr et al. (2008)</a> applied noxious stimuli such as acetic acid to the antennae of shrimp and reported that they responded by grooming the affected antenna and rubbing it against the side of the tank. The specificity of the response is consistent with conscious awareness of the location of the injury and a desire to soothe the resulting pain. On the other hand, anesthetics also increased grooming, suggesting that the response need not indicate pain experience (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/M8JY-B7ZV\">Faulkes, 2014</a>). Also, <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0010244\">Puri and Falkes (2010)</a> failed to replicate these findings, although their methodology was slightly different.</li><li>Response to anesthetics: If pain mediates responses to threatening stimuli, then attenuating pain should reduce those responses. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2003.09.034\">Taylor et al. (2004)</a> report that lidocaine reduced disoriented swimming (e.g., crashing into walls) in <i>P. vannamei </i>shrimp. However, anesthetics could also reduce responsiveness to threatening stimuli simply by reducing overall alertness rather than particularly mitigating pain.</li></ol><p>Not only is the little extant evidence relevant to shrimp sentience ambiguous, but it also primarily focuses on Caridean shrimp, a different evolutionary group than penaeids who make up the majority of farmed shrimp (<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.51291/2377-7478.1691\">Crump et al., 2022</a>; see Figure 3 below). However, a lack of relevant research is not itself evidence against shrimp sentience. Going forward, the most informative tests would involve observing whether shrimp can make trade-offs between novel sets of opportunities and threats (for more detail, see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10071-023-01773-2\">Farnsworth and Elwood, 2023</a>).</p></th></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3>Measuring shrimp welfare</h3><p>We embrace an affect-based definition of welfare that identifies an animal's welfare with the valence, duration, and intensity of its experiences. To identify proxies for valenced experience, we adopt the Five Domains framework (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ani10101870\">Mellor et al., 2020</a>; see Figure 1), which was originally applied to terrestrial vertebrates but has recently been extended to aquatic invertebrates (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ani13050807\">Pedrazzani et al., 2023</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1163/25889567-bja10025\">Perkins, 2021</a>). Domain 1 is Nutrition (e.g., restricted feed intake reduces welfare, a balanced diet increases it), Domain 2 is Environment (e.g., overcrowding reduces welfare, a clean space increases it), Domain 3 is Health (e.g., mutilations reduce welfare, high immune capacity increases it), and Domain 4 is Behavior (e.g., a barren environment reduces welfare, an absence of predators increases it). The first four domains do not themselves reflect good or bad welfare, but instead influence welfare via Domain 5, Mental State (e.g., pain is a manifestation of negative welfare, comfort is a positive welfare state; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7120/09627286.24.3.241\">Mellor &amp; Beausoleil, 2015, p. 242</a>).</p><p><img style=\"width:624.037px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/ntsockryq449rcffrfz7\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/czbb1eu3v7zswdtewtgl 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/x0hpkujbtjmaywglcubs 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/wmyylargkkfvtucbgake 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/s6qi1sxae73rd4mrlvso 750w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/snnopsy0t641tgzoi6bo 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/kajdfxoerolnlxkmew4o 1500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/a8nt6m1z2ntrahq2nuyo 2500w\"></p><p><i>Figure 1: Adaptation of Five Domains framework based on </i><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7120/09627286.24.3.241\"><i>Mellor and Beausoleil (2015)</i></a><i>. Only negative states are depicted here given this report's focus on threats. Vulnerability is added to distinguish between threats that directly and indirectly reduce welfare.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Threats in the first four domains will clearly affect biological fitness, but why would they cause negative experiences? Indeed, some genuine welfare threats probably only influence experience indirectly (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2527/1991.69104167x\">Broom, 1991</a>). For example, poor immune health may not cause negative experiences on its own, but it would still constitute a welfare threat if it exacerbated negative experiences during an infection. However, in many cases, it is plausible that valenced experience mediates the perception of threats and physiological and behavioral responses that mitigate the threats. In particular, Domains 1 through 3 are \"survival-related factors\" that arouse emotions to motivate behavior that would safeguard fitness (e.g., thirst motivates the search for water). Meanwhile, Domain 4 represents \"situation-related factors\" that arouse negative emotions in preparation to respond (e.g., the presence of predators causes anxiety). Also, environments that thwart fitness-enhancing behaviors will arouse negative emotions in an attempt to change the situation (e.g., the inability to move freely causes frustration). Although these emotional responses evolved in ancestral environments, they may still occur even when they are irrelevant to survival in captivity. For example, social species may experience reduced welfare when isolated on farms, even though conspecifics have no ability to enhance their fitness in that context.</p><p>The Five Domains model has been updated to account for positive welfare (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.7120/09627286.24.3.241\">Mellor &amp; Beausoleil, 2015, pp. 244\u2013245</a>). However, many theorized determinants of positive welfare result from successfully confronting welfare threats (e.g., the cessation of pain causes relief) or being free from them in the first place (e.g., the absence of predators causes calmness). Furthermore, because our goal is to determine whether the precautionary principle is applicable to shrimp aquaculture, we focus here on negative threats only.

Just three species make up the majority of farmed individuals\u2014<i>P. vannamei</i> (family: Penaeidae), <i>P. monodon</i> (family: Penaeidae), and <i>M. rosenbergii</i> (family: Palaemonidae; infraorder: Caridea). Due to its fast growth rate and high tolerance for a range of environmental conditions, <i>P. vannamei</i> alone accounts for approximately 82% of global shrimp aquaculture production (<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/b8n3t\">Waldhorn &amp; Autric, 2023</a>). <i>P. vannamei</i> and <i>P. monodon</i> are marine species farmed using similar approaches, while <i>M. rosenbergii</i> is a freshwater species reared under different conditions (Figure 3).</p><p><img style=\"width:624.037px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/whhger7r4emxgpd53ox3\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/c9ujfdtbd04jnasm5xhl 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/aksdgprvwgoonha8tlwd 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/sgw1ufdhqsbfnaawupdz 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/tmlvhqbbksfyigzoaleo 750w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/kq8jpnncy7dp2nq2xrkp 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/zqsbexji4ldqar2tzztu 1500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/ghwebidwfbam7jhqbjoi 2500w\"></p><p><i>Figure 2: Tonnes of shrimp produced globally from 1950 to 2021 from aquaculture (black) and wild capture (orange), along with contributions to aquaculture tonnage by P. vannamei (dashed blue), P. monodon (dashed green), and M. rosenbergii (dashed pink).

In the farming process, shrimp of different life stages are moved to corresponding rearing environments (Figure 4c). Each rearing stage in Figure 4 represents a different body of water. The rearing environments that eggs, larvae, postlarvae, and broodstock are kept in are commonly referred to as tanks, whereas juvenile\u2013subadults are generally referred to as being in ponds (see <a href=\"https://perma.cc/DT32-95S6\">FAO, 2009a</a>)\u2014we, therefore, most commonly use this terminology throughout the report but note that different shrimp farms may vary.

Broodstock are matured in maturation tanks, often using eyestalk ablation (see <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn#Eyestalk_ablation__domain_3__health_\">Eyestalk ablation</a> section), and they lay their eggs in spawning tanks. The eggs are moved to hatching tanks for hatching. The resultant larvae are moved to larval-rearing tanks until they reach the postlarval stage. Postlarvae may be moved straight to ongrowing ponds or first to a nursery to develop more.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"5\" data-footnote-id=\"z991694sfyh\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefz991694sfyh\"><sup><a href=\"#fnz991694sfyh\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Shrimp grow in ongrowing ponds until they reach the juvenile\u2013subadult stage, when they are harvested. Shrimp are reared for a total of three to six months (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-818040-2.00002-2\">Prangnell et al., 2019, p. 19</a>) and the majority of this time\u2014around two to five months\u2014is spent in the ongrowing rearing facility.</p><p>In the wild, penaeid shrimp (those from the Penaeidae family; see Figure 3) spawn their eggs in the open ocean, where the eggs hatch into larvae. After about ten days, they reach the postlarval stage and migrate to inshore, brackish waters, developing a benthic lifestyle by the fifth day of this stage (i.e., primarily crawling instead of swimming; <a href=\"https://wp-bmkgenetics-2022.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/media/2021/05/01133136/Benchmark-Genetics_Shrimp-Larvae-Feeding-Guide_DIGITAL_ENG.pdf\">Benchmark Genetics, 2022</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/DT32-95S6\">FAO, 2009a</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-818040-2.00002-2\">Prangnell et al., 2019, p. 19</a>). They return to the ocean when they reach the adult stage. Conversely, <i>M. rosenbergii</i> hatch their eggs in brackish water, where the larvae develop, before returning to freshwater at the postlarval stage (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/6KJD-T6N7\">FAO, 2009b</a>). The water used in different rearing stages therefore has to be adjusted accordingly for the species and shrimp life stage it hosts.</p><p>Shrimp feed also has to change over their life course, as they grow larger and their digestive tracts become more complex (<a href=\"https://5mbooks.com/product/the-shrimp-book-ii\">Reis et al., 2022, p.357</a>). Larval shrimp are small and planktonic, so they are fed algae and live <i>Artemia</i> (brine shrimp) larvae.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"6\" data-footnote-id=\"anzgqo2837s\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefanzgqo2837s\"><sup><a href=\"#fnanzgqo2837s\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;By the ongrowing stage, they become benthic, opportunistic feeders and are generally considered omnivores (though <i>P. monodon</i> is more carnivorous and predatory than <i>P. vannamei</i>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/72G5-H63W\">FAO, 2023c</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-12-818040-2.00002-2\">Prangnell et al., 2019, p. 24</a>), feeding on algae, detritus, other small crustaceans, and polychaetes, amongst others, in the wild (<a href=\"https://5mbooks.com/product/the-shrimp-book-ii\">Bardera et al., 2022, p. 337</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/3RFG-AQWX\">Kungvankij et al., 1986a</a>). On farms, they are fed artificial feeds or the natural productivity of the pond sustains them (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-20966-6_11\">Bauer, 2023, p. 628</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/DT32-95S6\">FAO, 2009a</a>).</p><p>Shrimp grow by molting their exoskeleton, a process demanding great energy expenditure (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-012374473-9.00453-7\">Penn et al., 2001, p. 699</a>). They shed their old exoskeleton and then grow considerably before developing a new one. Therefore, individuals increase in weight and size in abrupt stages (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/8KSC-SHWG\">New, 2002, pp. 8\u20139</a>). Between a molt and the development of a new exoskeleton is a period of time where a shrimp has no hard exoskeleton, and is therefore particularly vulnerable to outside threats like disease or damage from conflict.</p><p>The various structures related to different life stages may be present at different shrimp farming facilities in different combinations (Figure 4a). For example, a fully integrated farm may have its own broodstock facility, hatchery, and ongrowing system (e.g., see <a href=\"https://perma.cc/WTZ6-TU2L\">Sun Shrimp</a>). Or, a farm may have an on-site hatchery and ongrowing ponds. Alternatively, a large-scale hatchery may purchase broodstock from a specialized facility and supply postlarvae to stand-alone ongrowing farms. A small-scale hatchery may purchase fertilized eggs or larvae from a larger hatchery and then rear them to the postlarval stage before supplying them to an ongrowing facility.</p><p>Even on fully integrated farms shrimp are handled so they can be transferred between tanks. Shrimp can be transferred <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/15TNPt3L4MlhC80p2T6E3N_nerDu-SYSB/view?usp=sharing\">using pumps, draining to a different pond at a lower elevation,</a> placed in transport tanks and carried, or transferred <a href=\"https://perma.cc/V49J-FFXG\">via nets </a>(<a href=\"https://perma.cc/7N9D-NPUA\">Villalo\u0301n, 1991</a>). Within the same tank, shrimp may be handled briefly to check for things like disease and growth status.</p><p>In other cases, shrimp are transported alive between facilities, which are sometimes in different countries or even continents. For shorter distances, water-based methods are used to transport shrimp by car or transfer by foot. Shrimp are placed in boxes with a fine mesh bottom and lid. These boxes, in turn, are placed in tanks with circulating water and controlled temperature (<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1002/9780470995082\">Wickins &amp; Lee, 2002, p. 137</a>). Alternatively, they are transported in polyethylene bags with water. Commonly, oxygen is provided and the water temperature is controlled using ice packs and air-conditioned trucks (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-88606-4.50018-7\">Olin &amp; Fast, 1992, p. 313</a>; <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1002/9780470995082\">Wickins &amp; Lee, 2002, p. 144</a>). For longer distances, waterless methods are used to transport shrimp by car or plane. Farmers first reduce the water temperature to reduce the shrimp's metabolic rate and prevent cannibalism (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/U56Q-HHYL\">Kuhn &amp; Taylor, 2017</a>). They are then placed on chilled wood shavings or hemp, which are placed in hermetically sealed containers enriched with pressurized oxygen and kept cool with ice packs. Some shrimp are transported live at the end of production as well. In some countries, consumers are willing to pay a price premium to purchase shrimp alive (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.736168\">Guan et al., 2021</a>). Some shrimp are also sold live to be used as fishing bait (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/VS6A-7V7U\">Florida Shore Fishing, 2014</a>).</p><p>Once shrimp have reached market size, they are harvested and (if not being sold live) slaughtered. Some farmers use partial harvesting, where some shrimp are harvested during the farming cycle to improve cash flow or create more room in the pond for other shrimp to grow larger (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaeng.2015.11.003\">Estrada-P\u00e9rez et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2007.10.031\">Yu et al., 2009</a>). Total harvesting, on the other hand, involves removing all shrimp at one time at the end of the production cycle.</p><p>A variety of trapping or collection methods are used in both types of harvest. Most involve nets of varying levels of sophistication. Cast nets are weighted and capture everything beneath them as they sink to the bottom of the ponds (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/DJ93-PHK3\">HATCH, 2019a</a>). Electro-fishing involves placing electrodes on a drag net or using hand-held electrical gear; the electrical discharge makes shrimp jump out of the water and land in the net (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/6HGN-5GH3\">Cook &amp; Rabanal, 1978a</a>; <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1002/9780470995082\">Wickins &amp; Lee, 2002, p. 158</a>). Recently, more farmers have used mechanical harvesting, using various types of machines to pump shrimp out of the water (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.32473/edis-fa123-2006\">Ohs et al., 2006</a>).</p><p>Once shrimp are out of the pond, they should be slaughtered. The study of slaughter methods for decapods has largely neglected small species like shrimp, instead focusing on larger ones, such as lobsters (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11041089\">Conte et al., 2021</a>). Moreover, the slaughter of decapod crustaceans is mostly unregulated (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.886024\">Albalat et al., 2022</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11041089\">Conte et al., 2021</a>), and there appear to be no standard practices in this domain. The FAO factsheets for <i>P. vannamei</i>, <i>P. monodon</i>, and <i>M. rosenbergii</i> suggest that all three species are most commonly slaughtered using an ice slurry (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/DT32-95S6\">FAO, 2009a</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/6KJD-T6N7\">2009b</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/72G5-H63W\">2023c</a>).</p><p><strong>Farm characteristics</strong></p><p>Ongrowing facilities are typically characterized as extensive, semi-intensive, intensive, or super-intensive, depending on their yield potential per unit area per time period. The FAO notes that these categories do not describe the actual diversity in operating practices implemented in different locations (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/5N9A-NE43\">Barg et al., 1999</a>). That said, there are clusters of practices and conditions that roughly align with how intensively managed a farm is, which we list in Table 1 below. Note that any numerical estimate is relative to time and place, so our numerical ranges reflect our best understanding of contemporary differences in countries with the greatest amount of shrimp production.</p><p>Extensive and semi-intensive farms are located in tidal areas from which they source water. Extensive farmers rely on daily tidal cycles for water exchange, so there is little they can do when pathogens or low-quality water incidentally enters the pond. Extensive farms most closely match a shrimp\u2019s natural habitat. For example, the earthen bottom of extensive ponds should allow shrimp to burrow if it is not too compacted (farmers compact soils to avoid erosion; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/3D5U-V37C\">Boyd et al., 2012</a>)\u2014the substrate on the bottom of the pond is usually the natural pond soil. In the wild, shrimp are subject to high predation pressure (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01316307\">Salini et al., 1990</a>). During the day, some species dig into the soft sand bottom to hide from predators, with only their eyes protruding (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-0981(95)00064-X\">Kenyon et al., 1995</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10211-002-0069-y\">Mariappan &amp; Balasundaram, 2003</a>; <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1002/9780470995082\">Wickins &amp; Lee, 2002, p. 158</a>). White shrimp (which includes <i>P. vannamei</i>) show less burrowing behavior than other groups, particularly brown shrimp (including <i>P. monodon</i>), who burrow daily (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/72G5-H63W\">FAO, 2023c</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/HED7-QY8H\">Farfante, 1969</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2006.01519.x\">Pontes et al., 2006</a>).</p><p>Semi-intensive farmers more closely monitor water quality and have greater control over it. They use pumps to bring water into the pond, so they can also pump it out when necessary. Semi-intensive farmers often store water in sediment ponds to reduce turbidity and break down organic matter (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/QY5F-HXNQ\">Lin &amp; Drazba, 2006, pp. 79\u201382</a>). They also occasionally use mechanical aerators to maintain dissolved oxygen levels.</p><p>Intensive and super-intensive farms aerate water more frequently and source it externally to ensure it is biosecure (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/DT32-95S6\">FAO, 2009a</a>). They also exchange it far less. Instead, Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12562-019-01357-5\">Shinji et al., 2019</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0144-8609(02)00055-9\">Thakur &amp; Lin, 2003</a>) circulate water out of the ongrowing pond, through different treatment ponds (Box 3), and back into the pond. Both types of farms line their ponds to prevent diseases and erosion by aerator-generated water currents (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/KA9P-GV2M\">Benchmark Insights, 2019, p. 54</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jwas.12394\">Boyd et al., 2017</a>), but liners likely also prevent shrimp from performing their normal burrowing behaviors. Both may also use biofloc systems, where bacteria are introduced to convert organic matter that would otherwise become toxic into edible biomass.

In the wild, shrimp would not be expected to aggregate in groups while they are burrowing, as this would undermine their camouflage (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.03.017\">Evans et al., 2007</a>). However, species who do not burrow or are at least not currently hiding might aggregate in groups, as this could reduce the likelihood of predation at the individual level (<a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/living-in-groups-9780198508182?cc=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;\">Krause &amp; Ruxton, 2002, Ch. 2</a>). There are conflicting accounts of whether wild penaeids exhibit aggregating behavior. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-0-387-77101-4_14\">Bauer (2010)</a> reports that \u201cPenaeoidean and many caridean species are highly mobile and live in dense aggregations, resulting in frequent contacts among individuals,\u201d while others report that such behavior is rare in most penaeids (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1071/MF9790639\">Lucas et al., 1979</a>). <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.15517/rbt.v56i2.5605\">Rivera-Vel\u00e1zquez et al. (2008)</a> found that wild <i>P. vannamei</i> juveniles were present in a coastal lagoon in Mexico at average densities of 0.302m<sup>-2</sup> (see <a href=\"https://perma.cc/3RZ7-PPJH\">Medina-Reyer, 2001</a> for slightly higher estimates), though seasonality played a large role: during the rainy season, densities at one point reached 4.9m<sup>-2</sup>. This is consistent with shrimp moving towards favorable environments, with aggregation as a byproduct rather than an instinct that evolved to avoid predation (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2007.03.017\">Evans et al., 2007</a>). Extensive farms most closely match the densities of shrimp found in the wild. As the shrimp farming industry becomes more intensive, more shrimp will experience more environments that differ from their natural ones.</p><p>Few estimates exist concerning the proportion of global shrimp output produced by each type of farm. An expert from the industry interviewed for this report estimates that, in 2020, around 5% of the worldwide output may come from extensive farms, 30% from semi-intensive, 60% from intensive, and finally, 5% from super-intensive operations. However, from a more comprehensive analysis of available data, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jwas.12841\">Boyd et al. (2022, p. 33)</a> conclude that, in 2018, the proportions of shrimp production from each system type were as follows: 11.5% extensive, 16.5% semi-intensive, and 71.8% intensive. As the authors mention hyper-intensive (c.f. super-intensive) facilities elsewhere in the report, we assume they are suggesting that this type of farm accounted for less than 1% of shrimp production that year. Note that with the trend towards intensification, this may have changed by now.</p><h2>Welfare threats</h2><h3>Diseases (domain 3: health)</h3><p>Annually, viral infections are responsible for substantial losses in tropical shrimp aquaculture production, and disease is persistently identified by shrimp farmers as the biggest industry challenge (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/FF3X-4LW4\">Anderson et al., 2016a</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/EH83-VD8G\">2016b</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/4F43-4F74\">2017</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/L3TD-3RKJ\">2018</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/A5N7-TZHL\">2019</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/GYL3-XWHX\">HATCH, 2019c</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jip.2012.03.013\">Stentiford et al., 2012</a>). The large burden of disease partly reflects the fact that disease is a downstream consequence of many of the other welfare issues we will discuss in subsequent sections.</p><p>Shrimp are also inherently vulnerable to disease because, like all crustaceans, they do not have an adaptive immune system like that of vertebrates, only an innate immune system (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0044-8486(00)00430-0\">Arala-Chaves &amp; Sequeira, 2000</a>; <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1177/1753425909102876\">Vazquez et al., 2009</a>). Because shrimp generally cannot be immunized against diseases, the industry has only three preventative strategies left. First, they can source disease-free shrimp. The industry is increasingly dependent on domestically-bred, Specific-Pathogen Free (SPF) seed shrimp. SPF shrimp are those from populations raised in biosecure facilities, with biosecure feeds, that have tested negative for certain shrimp pathogens for two consecutive years (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/raq.12305\">Alday-Sanz et al., 2020</a>). SPF status does not indicate anything about tolerance to pathogens, instead only referring to an absence of disease (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-3215-0_27\">Eswaran, 2021</a>). Some facilities claim to be breeding specific-pathogen resistant and tolerant shrimp,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"7\" data-footnote-id=\"w7le48o8hhj\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefw7le48o8hhj\"><sup><a href=\"#fnw7le48o8hhj\">[7]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;though an expert told us these are not yet widely available in the industry.</p><p>Second, farmers can use medicine to treat or prevent infection (see Box 3). Some use antibiotics, but this has resulted in the emergence of antibiotic-resistant strains (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/are.15142\">Vaiyapuri et al., 2021</a>). Probiotics improve the gut microbiota of shrimp or pond water (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/GM56-68E2\">Alune, 2021a</a>), bolstering shrimp immunity to bacterial diseases (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/raq.12477\">Knipe et al., 2020, pp. 325\u2013327</a>).</p><p>Third, farmers can maintain a disease-free environment. <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.3354/dao047129\">Wu et al. (2001)</a> showed that when diseased carcasses were immediately removed from tanks, there was a lower mortality rate than when they were removed at regular intervals in a tank of the same density (see also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2014.11.038\">Hamano et al., 2015</a>). The World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) notes in the Aquatic Animal Health Code (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/8GPW-2W3L\">WOAH, 2022, 4.1.7</a>) that pathogens may enter a shrimp farm via other animals, water, feed, and farm equipment. When multiple farms use a common water source, disease incidence at one farm can easily spread to another (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/KA9P-GV2M\">Benchmark Insights, 2019, p. 53</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2010.11.039\">Tendencia et al., 2011</a>). Similarly, an expert interviewed for this report claimed that insects easily act as vectors of pathogen agents when farms are close to one another. Also, some water contaminants may reduce the immune responses of shrimp (see <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/welfare-considerations-for-farmed-shrimp#Water_pollutants\">Water pollutants</a> section). Where biosecurity measures fail and it is not possible or cost-efficient to treat the stock, farmers may use depopulation methods and then begin the farming cycle again from scratch.</p><p><strong>Significant infectious diseases</strong></p><p>The WOAH lists significant aquatic animal diseases (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/8GPW-2W3L\">WOAH, 2022, Section 1.2</a>) that:</p><ul><li>Can be detected and diagnosed</li><li>Have spread internationally</li><li>Severely impact industry productivity, wild animal health, or human health (in the case of listed shrimp diseases, all appear to have impacted industry growth rather than wild animal or human health)<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"8\" data-footnote-id=\"0oe0lbqm2g3b\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref0oe0lbqm2g3b\"><sup><a href=\"#fn0oe0lbqm2g3b\">[8]</a></sup></span></li></ul><p>Of the <a href=\"https://perma.cc/8FMJ-X875\">11 aquatic crustacean diseases</a> listed by WOAH, ten affect farmed shrimp.

Although shrimp have adaptations for maintaining homeostasis, energy used to preserve optimal functioning cannot be allocated towards other physiological tasks, such as fighting infections (<a href=\"https://5mbooks.com/product/the-shrimp-book-ii\">Clayton et al., 2022, p. 296</a>). As a result, suboptimal water quality may reduce growth and increase susceptibility to disease.</p><p>Here, we focus on five parameters that are fundamental to shrimp health: <strong>dissolved oxygen (DO)</strong>, <strong>temperature</strong>, <strong>salinity</strong>, <strong>pH</strong>, and <strong>ammonia</strong> (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-88606-4.50029-1\">Boyd &amp; Fast, 1992, pp. 497\u2013500</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/FD5P-5ERL\">Kungvankij et al., 1986b</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0044-8486(00)00422-1\">Le Moullac &amp; Haffner, 2000</a>). Separate from these water quality parameters, we also discuss <strong>water pollutants</strong>, including pesticides and heavy metals. We present standards for what the water quality parameter concentrations should be in Table 3. Note that acceptable levels for larvae and young postlarvae are usually more restrictive since these animals are often more sensitive and have different environmental requirements than juveniles and adults. Optimal ranges are typically less restrictive during intermolt periods when shrimp have a hard exoskeleton.</p><p>The recommended standards evaluate each dimension of water quality in isolation from one another. In reality, the optimal level of some parameters depends on the values of others. For example, high temperature results in lower DO levels because warmer water holds less oxygen, while higher salinity reduces DO levels because salt makes oxygen less soluble (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-88606-4.50029-1\">Boyd &amp; Fast, 1992, p. 501</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/LM7V-B37H\">Lazur, 2007</a>). The way shrimp react to certain parameters can also affect other parameters. For instance, shrimp consume more oxygen at higher temperatures, increasing the rate at which DO depletes (<a href=\"https://5mbooks.com/product/the-shrimp-book-ii\">Hargreaves &amp; Boyd (2022, p. 208</a>). Water quality standards ignore these complexities to make water quality monitoring simpler.</p><p>We extracted data from surveys to estimate the extent to which farms maintain water quality within the recommended ranges. For each study, we estimated the average percentage of the time that water quality is \"optimal\" (i.e., no negative welfare effects) and \"suboptimal\" (i.e., negative welfare effects that are either sublethal only or cause lethality at rates that are typical in natural conditions), from which we can also infer how often it is unacceptably low. The complete analysis, including a discussion of the limitations of available data, is available in our supplementary document, <a href=\"https://rpubs.com/wmcauliffe2222/shrimpwaterquality\">Water Quality in Shrimp Ongrowing Ponds</a>; the results are summarized in figures in the subsections below.</p><p><i>Table 3.

Beyond a certain concentration of DO, there is no additional benefit of greater amounts of it. However, the point at which DO consumption is independent of DO concentration varies according to how active shrimp are\u2014after feeding, during the post-molt stage, and while swimming, respiration rates are much higher (<a href=\"https://5mbooks.com/product/the-shrimp-book-ii\">Hargreaves &amp; Boyd, 2022, pp. 211\u2013214</a>).</p><p>In extensive and semi-intensive ponds, most DO is a by-product of photosynthesis by plants and phytoplankton in the pond. Because phytoplankton also respire, they consume more DO than they produce when there is little photosynthesis. Accordingly, shrimp \"are often exposed to hypoxic conditions\" due to a lack of sunlight at night (<a href=\"https://5mbooks.com/product/the-shrimp-book-ii\">Hargreaves &amp; Boyd, 2022, p. 218)</a>.</p><p>Less obviously, phytoplankton near the surface can block sunlight from reaching plants and algae beneath the surface. Farmers strive for an intermediate amount of phytoplankton so that there is enough photosynthesis to meet the demand for DO but not so much that they shade each other.</p><p>In intensive systems, there is greater oxygen demand due to higher stocking densities and the introduction of biofloc. Moreover, bacteria begin displacing phytoplankton over the course of production, so farmers need mechanical aerators to increase DO levels. The paddlewheel aerators most frequently used do a better job at increasing dissolved oxygen near the surface than towards the bottom, where shrimp often prefer to dwell. Some farmers also use aerators designed to reduce stratification, but they can result in strong water currents around the periphery and near-stagnant waters in the middle. The periphery is well-mixed but is not necessarily desirable because shrimp must swim against the current to stay in place.

These studies usually also forcibly expose animals to non-preferred temperatures to identify the \"critical thermal maximum\", and minimum. These thresholds are the point at which animals lose the ability to move in a desired direction, show a loss of the \"righting reflex,\" or the ability to maintain balance (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1355-557X.2001.00638.x\">Hoang et al., 2002, p. 23</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2010.06.008\">Kumlu et al., 2010, p. 303</a>)</p><p>This study designs raise two important points about the relationship between welfare and observable behavior. First, preferences can only provide an ordinal ranking of different conditions, not an absolute measure of welfare. While the preferred temperature presumably creates positive welfare and the temperatures beyond the critical point presumably result in negative welfare, it is indeterminate whether the range of temperatures in between creates positive or negative welfare. As <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/0003-3472(77)90054-9\">Dawkins (1977, pp. 1041\u20131042)</a> points out, when animals have multiple options, they will choose the best option even if the other options are also rewarding. Non-behavioral evidence would be required to show that a non-preferred but sublethal temperature is reducing welfare.</p><p>Second, the metrics that farmers optimize for do not necessarily maximize welfare. For example, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1071/MF97236\">Chen &amp; Chen, 1999</a> note that the temperature preference of postlarval P. monodon shrimp (20\u201325.6\u00baC, mean of 23.2\u02daC) is below their optimal growth temperature for the species. The authors suggest that individuals may choose a lower temperature to conserve energy, given uncertainty about food availability and the potential negative effect of high temperatures on survival. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2010.05.004\">Gonz\u00e1lez et al. (2010)</a> argue that optimization for growth depends on life stage: P. vannamei juveniles do select temperatures based on growth, whereas adult preferences are driven by investment in reproduction.</p><p>Overall, growth typically is evidence of good health, it may be at the expense of the quality of experience. The present report uses growth as one proxy among many for good welfare, mostly because it is almost always measured in studies of aquaculture. Studies that are designed from a welfare perspective should measure behavioral preferences, even though they are imperfect measures on their own.</p></th></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>The temperature in ponds can fluctuate daily and with the seasons (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/QY5F-HXNQ\">Lin &amp; Drazba, 2006, p. 79</a>).

When external salinity is lower, water will be drawn into the shrimp's cells. If the inflow continues unabated, cells will swell and eventually burst. Conversely, if the external salinity is higher, water will be drawn out of cells and into the external environment. If too much water leaves, cells will shrink and lose their structure. Shrimp have mechanisms for adjusting their internal salinity, but these adjustments take time, so rapid changes in salinity can cause \u201cosmotic shock,\u201d potentially leading to death. The ideal external salinity for shrimp is their isosmotic point\u2014the internal salinity they do not need to expend resources to maintain (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1753-5131.2010.01036.x\">Roy et al., 2010</a>). The isosmotic point for <i>P. vannamei</i> is about 25 ppt (<a href=\"https://5mbooks.com/product/the-shrimp-book-ii\">Clayton et al., 2022 p. 292</a>).</p><p>Extensive and semi-intensive farms typically take their water from estuaries, the salinity of which changes with season. Within a production cycle, salinity declines during the rainy season and increases in the dry season\u2014farms that do not regularly exchange and treat their water will be vulnerable to these fluctuations (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-88606-4.50029-1\">Boyd &amp; Fast, 1992, p. 501</a>). In climates with dry summers, a high evaporation rate can gradually increase the usual salinity levels (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/FD5P-5ERL\">Kungvankij et al., 1986b</a>).</p><p>Intensive and super-intensive farms are often indoors, shielding them from weather-mediated salinity changes. They also often use low-salinity water, as a cost-saving measure (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2006.05.003\">Boopathy et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1753-5131.2010.01036.x\">Roy et al., 2010</a>). Shrimp in these systems are likely acclimatized to low-salinity conditions prior to being put in ponds, which would negate some of the negative impacts (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1753-5131.2010.01036.x\">Roy et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaeng.2018.04.002\">Suantika et al., 2018</a>).</p><p>According to <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4615-5407-3\">Boyd &amp; Tucker (1998, p. 94)</a>, if shrimp are reared outside the recommended ranges for their species and development stage, \u201cperformance is diminished and survival may be poor\u201d. Penaeids are marine animals, so we expect greater sensitivity to low salinities. Indeed, growth and survival tend to decrease with decreasing salinity (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40064-016-1878-1\">Chen et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2016.09.001\">Gao et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-7345.2001.tb00464.x\">Laramore et al., 2001</a>). That said, salinities above 60 ppt can be lethal even for penaeids (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-88606-4.50029-1\">Boyd &amp; Fast, 1992, p.497</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ani13050807\">Pedrazzani et al., 2023, Table 11</a>). Nevertheless, we expect overly high salinities to be rare on farms: the water used by extensive and semi-intensive farms is usually brackish or coastal, and water sourced by inland farms (intensive and super-intensive) is generally of low salinity (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ibiod.2006.05.003\">Boopathy et al., 2007</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1753-5131.2010.01036.x\">Roy et al., 2010</a>). Moreover, deviations in either direction are unlikely to have catastrophic consequences for penaeid shrimp, so long as the change is not too sudden. Part of the reason <i>P. vannamei</i> are so popular to raise on farms is that they can tolerate a very wide range of salinity levels (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4615-5407-3\">Boyd &amp; Tucker, 1998, pp. 99\u2013100</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1186/s40064-016-1878-1\">Chen et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-7345.2002.tb00481.x\">McGraw et al., 2002</a>).</p><p>Our quantitative analysis of <a href=\"https://rpubs.com/wmcauliffe2222/shrimpwaterquality\">water quality in shrimp ongrowing ponds</a> suggests that optimal salinity levels are less common than optimal levels of other water quality parameters. Instead, salinity is more often at suboptimal levels. It seems possible that farmers make less of an effort to maintain ideal salinity levels, possibly because they know penaeids can tolerate wide salinity ranges. Therefore, even though nonoptimal salinity may be more prevalent than other water quality concerns, the effect on shrimp welfare may be less substantial, relative to other water quality parameters. Note, however, that the data cannot speak to the prevalence of unacceptably fast <i>changes</i> in salinity levels.</p><p><img style=\"width:624.037px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/eaf4qwzgkbweeeq79tft\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/jealx8fostd6l6xkywch 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/vhtlrnr9ok7clvjf2umg 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/f8kj8zuj7llxo23cosux 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/a7mlla7rn5jaorxwigev 750w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/dixhmwzijme8x8bi7ryh 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/tkz7blggbl3vylrv55ny 1500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/ujvrdgbrg45rpehcpcja 2500w\"></p><p><i>Figure 7: Estimates of the average percentage of the time that shrimp farms maintain optimal or suboptimal salinity levels.

Similarly, higher stocking densities reduce pH because there are more shrimp and more microbes added in to detoxify ammonia. To make ponds more alkaline, farmers carry out liming during pond preparation before stocking and to the water during production cycles (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/2NMZ-64CT\">Boyd, 2017b</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/47TQ-43BD\">Kungvankij et al., 1986c</a>).</p><p>As alluded to in Box 2, there is debate over whether shrimp have aversive reactions to acids.

However, gradual exposure to low pH may provide some protection against bacterial infection for <i>P. vannamei</i> (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.11.052\">Han et al., 2018</a>).</p><p>Our summary of water quality studies suggests suboptimal pH levels about 15% of the time and otherwise optimal levels (Figure 8). The exception again is <a href=\"https://perma.cc/BU5Y-LKXX\">Venkateswarlu et al. (2019)</a>, where pH is optimal only around 60% of the time, and is unacceptable around 15% of the time. Examination of this dataset suggests that overly high pH may be slightly more common than pH levels that are too low.</p><p><img style=\"width:624.037px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/wnk8lygcjancuco66wwk\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/prsy5bkp7y0j02xkbz1g 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/vcavluj7ya4d2fg7gnne 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/xrssdqqlnrqjf1ktk3ft 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/vu1xxfdolf4r9autmmvg 750w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/ttxfmchrfgvvzvl5uwwg 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/lzxbty8vki2korv7zide 1500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/xcb5vj5brwowvepjztey 2500w\"></p><p><i>Figure 8: Estimates of the average percentage of the time that shrimp farms maintain optimal or suboptimal pH levels.

The most important cause of ammonia accumulation in aquaculture is decomposing organic matter (decaying microalgae, shrimp feces, organic fertilizers, and unconsumed feed). Ammonia exists in water in two forms: as un-ionized ammonia (NH3) and as the ammonium ion (NH4+). Toxicity is related principally to un-ionized ammonia because of its greater permeability into the hemolymph, the invertebrate analog of vertebrate blood (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4615-5407-3\">Boyd &amp; Tucker, 1998, p. 48</a>). pH determines the percentage of ammonia that occurs un-ionized (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/NGN7-SFDB\">Kubitza, 2017</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/FD5P-5ERL\">Kungvankij et al., 1986b</a>). Similarly, a given concentration of un-ionized ammonia is more toxic when DO (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/0044-8486(90)90193-Q\">Allan et al., 1990</a>) or salinity concentrations (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0022-0981(01)00227-1\">Lin &amp; Chen, 2001</a>) are low.</p><p>The accumulation of un-ionized ammonia has several negative consequences, such as lower levels of feeding (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s0012800100\">Frias-Espericueta et al., 2000</a>). The main issue, though, is that un-ionized ammonia increases the likelihood of infection via several different paths. Ammonia damages shrimp gills, increasing susceptibility to viruses that target the gills (e.g., WSSV; <a href=\"https://5mbooks.com/product/the-shrimp-book-ii\">Clayton et al., 2022, p. 306</a>). Ammonia also damages the intestine barrier (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2018.04.050\">Duan et al., 2018b</a>), which normally prevents pathogenic invasion (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/raq.12429\">Zhao et al., 2020</a>). High ammonia concentrations also slow down hemolymph coagulation, allowing microbes to enter open wounds (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2015.04.019\">Chang et al., 2015</a>). Finally, high ammonia concentrations cause hemocyte apoptosis, directly reducing immune capacity (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2019.124759\">Liu et al., 2020</a>). At high enough levels in the hemolymph, ammonia directly causes mortality (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-88606-4.50029-1\">Boyd &amp; Fast, 1992, p. 498</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4615-5407-3\">Boyd &amp; Tucker, 1998, p. 135</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/NGN7-SFDB\">Kubitza, 2017</a>). Signs of impending death include hyperactivity, convulsions, and then lethargy and coma (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4615-5407-3\">Boyd &amp; Tucker, 1998, pp. 134\u2013136</a>).</p><p>Although several datasets considered in our <a href=\"https://rpubs.com/wmcauliffe2222/shrimpwaterquality\">quantitative analysis of water quality studies</a> measured total ammonia levels, very few measured un-ionized ammonia levels.

We cover pesticides and heavy metals, as these were the issues we found the most information on.</p><p>Shrimp farms located in or near industrial areas or agricultural zones are most likely to be affected by pesticide runoff, either directly into outdoor farming ponds or through contaminating the water source used by a farm. Some farmers may also purposely apply these chemicals to prevent disease or invasion by other species into the pond. Of 164 shrimp farms surveyed by <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2013.07.028\">Rico et al. (2013)</a> in Bangladesh, China, Thailand, and Vietnam, 12 applied parasiticides (which included some insecticides; see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2013.07.028\">Table 2 in Rico et al., 2013</a>). As shrimp are phylogenetically close to insects, with both in the phylum Arthropoda, they are vulnerable to damage from insecticides. The authors also reported that parasiticides are commonly sold in shrimp farm supply shops in Bangladesh, Vietnam, China, and, to a lesser extent, Thailand. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.112796\">Heal et al. (2021</a>) report that 63% of farmers surveyed in 2016 in Bangladesh used pesticides (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.marpolbul.2021.112796\">Table 3 in Heal et al., 2021</a>). Insecticides have also been found in shrimp farms in Mexico and may have contributed to reduced productivity in these areas (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00217-005-0012-3\">Burgos-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2006</a>). In Ecuador, 28 of 101 surveyed farms applied piscicides to their ponds (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jwas.12818\">Boyd et al., 2021</a>). As there is scant literature on the concentration at which pesticides are toxic, it is unclear if farmers are applying enough of these products to impact shrimp.</p><p>It has long been recognized that agricultural runoff of pesticides can be harmful to aquatic life (e.g., see <a href=\"https://perma.cc/SGU7-ZY53\">EFSA, 2013</a>). Several types of pesticides can affect a shrimp's health status. In <i>P. vannamei</i>, fungicides can have adverse effects on the immune system (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0044-8486(00)00420-8\">Mu\u00f1oz et al., 2000</a>) and those exposed to sublethal concentrations of pesticides exhibit abnormal swimming, hyperactivity, and spasms (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2005.09.001\">Garc\u00eda-de la Parra et al., 2006</a>). For <i>P. monodon</i>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2017.11.028\">Hook et al. (2018)</a> found that pesticides significantly affect the survival of postlarvae and that some types inhibited feeding behavior when used at non-lethal levels. Additionally, the authors found that water sources used by shrimp farms in Australia contained levels of these pesticides that would impede growth or survival.</p><p>Agricultural runoff and purposefully applied chemicals, like fertilizers or algaecides, can also introduce heavy metals into shrimp ponds (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2022.08.054\">Bautista-Covarrubias et al., 2022</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2020.03.018\">Qian et al., 2020</a>). Heavy metals may also be present in shrimp feed (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2016.11.163\">Islam et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaeng.2005.09.006\">Lyle-Fritch et al., 2006</a>). Some heavy metals, like zinc and copper, are essential for normal shrimp growth, but even these can cause adverse effects and mortality in high doses (<a href=\"https://5mbooks.com/product/the-shrimp-book-ii\">Zhou et al., 2022, pp. 377\u2013378</a>). In general, heavy metals can cause physiological alterations in shrimp, such as disruption of osmoregulation (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2008.06.010\">Fr\u00edas-Espericueta et al., 2008</a>) and gill damage, which can cause death by asphyxia (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2008.06.010\">Fr\u00edas-Espericueta et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00244-005-0214-5\">Li et al., 2007</a>). Heavy metal stress can make shrimp more susceptible to diseases (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2022.08.054\">Bautista-Covarrubias et al., 2022</a>). Chronic exposure to copper reduces growth and immunity in <i>P. vannamei</i> (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2020.03.018\">Qian et al., 2020</a>). Additionally, the presence of multiple heavy metals at levels considered to be safe when present individually can have similar effects to lethal doses of any one heavy metal (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2008.06.010\">Fr\u00edas-Espericueta et al., 2008</a>).</p><p>We were unable to find information about how much recirculating aquaculture systems and intensive farms are exposed to this issue. However, it is reasonable to assume that these water pollutants are less common in these systems because water is typically treated before use and many intensive farms are indoors, reducing the risk of insects accessing the farming area and therefore the need for insecticides.</p><h3>Stocking density (domains 2, 3, 4: environment, health, behavior)</h3><p>Farmers who adopt intensive production methods can employ higher stocking densities because they provide more aeration and food than is available in extensive ponds (see Table 4). High stocking densities worsen <strong>water quality</strong>. Fortunately, intensive farms have a greater capacity to manage water quality degradation. However, high densities reduce growth even when water quality parameters are carefully controlled (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jwas.12718\">da Silveira et al., 2020</a>), suggesting that crowding per se threatens welfare. In particular, crowding <strong>increases vulnerability</strong> to aggression and disease, and potentially <strong>frustrates preferences</strong>. Because these latter issues are inherent to crowding, they can only be addressed by reducing stocking densities.</p><p><i>Table 4.

(2016)</a> found that elevated mortality rates at densities of 100m<sup>-2</sup> could be attributed to ammonia toxicity (see also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2005.02.026\">Nga et al., 2005</a>). Because intensive farms exchange their water less, they do not have a natural mechanism for removing ammonia from tanks. One solution is to implement a biofloc system. However, microbes complicate water quality management because they need oxygen too. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-7345.2011.00507.x\">Krummenauer et al. (2011)</a> reported that dissolved oxygen showed an abrupt decrease after about 90 days of rearing <i>P. vannamei</i> with biofloc at intensive and super-intensive levels. This change comes after microbes begin to predominate over algae at around 64 to 70 days (<a href=\"https://5mbooks.com/product/the-shrimp-book-ii\">Hargreaves &amp; Boyd, 2022, p. 228</a>).</p><p>Meanwhile, an increased reliance on mechanical aeration poses risks of its own. Aerators tend to push sludge to the center of the tank (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0044-8486(02)00231-4\">Delgado et al., 2003</a>), which consumes oxygen that would otherwise be used for shrimp respiration. The anoxic environment in turn creates anaerobic byproducts including ammonia. Intensive farms can, however, install a drain or siphon to remove ammonia (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/NGN7-SFDB\">Kubitza, 2017</a>).</p><p>Our survey of farm water quality suggests that intensive farms may generally succeed in managing dissolved oxygen levels (see Figure 5). However, there was very little data on intensive (especially super-intensive) farms near the end of the crop cycle. Also, any system reliant on mechanical aeration risks a disaster if the aerators suddenly stop working, due to a mechanical problem or power failure.</p><p><strong>Increased vulnerability</strong></p><p>Even among species who do aggregate, they typically will not crowd as closely together as is physically possible because proximity comes with its own costs (<a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/living-in-groups-9780198508182?cc=gb&amp;lang=en&amp;\">Krause &amp; Ruxton, 2002, Ch. 3</a>). The most readily visible issue is aggression, which can occur due to territoriality or hunger. For <i>P. monodon</i>, cannibalism increases with density (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/7T84-XFD5\">Abdussamad &amp; Thampy, 1994</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/WEF3-YFU5\">Jiang et al., 2021</a>), possibly because it is easier to detect an easy target. Decapod crustaceans are particularly vulnerable to cannibalism when they do not have a hard exoskeleton, which routinely occurs after molting but can also result from disease or poor water quality (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/23308249.2016.1221379\">Romano &amp; Zeng, 2017</a>).</p><p>The greater aggressiveness of <i>M. rosenbergii</i> and <i>P. monodon</i> explains why farmers raise them at lower densities (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/9781444314649.ch9\">Valenti et al., 2009a, p. 168</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/9780470995082.ch2\">Wickins &amp; Lee, 2002, p. 15</a>). It is likely uncommon for <i>P. vannamei </i>shrimp to consume conspecifics who are still alive (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2008.06.030\">Araneda et al., 2008</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/are.12550\">da Costa et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2010.03.030\">Schroeder et al., 2010</a>), but they do form dominance hierarchies (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735949\">Bardera et al., 2021</a>). In crowded conditions, subordinate individuals likely have less energy to allocate to growth, since they have less access to food and space to rest (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2008.06.030\">Araneda et al., 2008, p. 16</a>). This could in turn result in physical heterogeneities, further intensifying hierarchies (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735949\">Bardera et al., 2021</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1086/712973\">Lord et al., 2021, p. 3</a>). The conflicts that establish these hierarchies are presumably negative on the whole, at least for losing individuals.</p><p><strong>Frustrated preferences</strong></p><p>If proximity indeed increases vulnerability, then shrimp should have evolved to prefer a certain amount of space. Given that wild shrimp aggregate at levels that are at most consistent with densities on extensive farms, densities in more intensive farms may frustrate their preference. In support of the possibility, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/are.12550\">da Costa et al. (2016)</a> report that retreat behaviors (i.e., moving away from other shrimp) are less common with increasing density. The authors suggest that shrimp value keeping a certain distance from each other, but cannot do so without simply getting closer to other individuals (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/are.12550\">pp. 919\u2013920</a>).</p><p>Personal space may also be an incidental requirement for other behavioral needs. For benthic species, rest and burrowing both require access to the bottom of the tank or pond. We examined whether shrimp movement would be restricted on a two-dimensional plane in different ongrowing systems, on the optimistic assumption that environmental parameters are suitable throughout the bottom of the tank. We use <i>P. vannamei</i> for these calculations, as they are stocked at the highest density (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jwas.12394\">Boyd et al., 2017</a>, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jwas.12524\">Boyd et al., 2018</a>). A mature <i>P. vannamei </i>postlarvae (after 22 days in the postlarval stage) is approximately 1.5 cm long (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/5M7Z-K546\">Teixeira &amp; Guerrelhas, 2014</a>). Adults can get as long as 23 cm (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/DT32-95S6\">FAO, 2009a</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3391/ai.2021.16.4.10\">Panutrakel &amp; Senanen, 2021</a>). If the <a href=\"https://perma.cc/N5ML-9A9X\">width-to-length ratio is about 0.16</a>, then postlarvae occupy an area of 0.36 cm\u00b2, while adults occupy an area of around 84.64 cm\u00b2. Postlarvae should have ample room to turn around even in super-intensive systems, whereas adults would run out of room in more densely packed intensive systems. In intensive systems, the initial number of shrimp per pond may be reduced later as the animals grow\u2014for example, when shrimp reach 5g, the density may be lowered to 140\u2013150/m<sup>2</sup> (<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1002/9780470995082\">Wickins &amp; Lee, 2002, p. 155</a>). However, at 140 adults per m<sup>2</sup>, there is only about 71 cm\u00b2 per adult, which would prevent shrimp from all simultaneously accessing the bottom. That said, we are unsure what percentage of shrimp want to rest at any given time.</p><h3>Environmental enrichment (domains 2, 4: environment, behavior)</h3><p>Not only are farm ponds often lined with plastic or concrete, but they also often lack shelters.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"9\" data-footnote-id=\"za93uni87a\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefza93uni87a\"><sup><a href=\"#fnza93uni87a\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;One might infer that such a barren environment constitutes behavioral deprivation, but it is unclear what kind of environments shrimp prefer. However, they might not be able to \u2018switch off\u2019 their tendency to be vigilant to predators, even if they live on a farm where predation is not possible. A lack of concealing structures or substrate to burrow inside of may make it harder for shrimp to feel protected from such threats. Hiding might also feel rewarding in its own right.</p><p><a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0044-8486(00)00538-X\">Bratvold and Browdy (2001)</a> found that adding only sand to ponds holding <i>P. vannamei</i> had no effect on growth or survival compared to no-sand ponds, but having sand and artificial, vertical substrates (AquaMats) increased growth rates and survival significantly. The study did not include a no-sand with artificial substrate treatment, so it is unclear if this effect is due to both features being present or not. However, looking at other evidence, the addition of artificial substrates into tanks does appear to improve both the growth and survival of juvenile shrimp (<i>P. monodon</i> with bamboo segments: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.04.031\">Anand et al., 2019</a>; <i>P. vannamei</i> with mesh screens: <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaeng.2012.12.003\">Schveitzer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/65GS-2SG6\">Sofyani &amp; Sambhu, 2020</a>)\u2014though note that one study found no significant differences (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaeng.2020.102093\">Fleckenstein et al., 2020</a>). Survival and growth of postlarvae in the nursery phase also appear improved by adding substrates (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaeng.2020.102063\">Tierney et al., 2020</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/2HWW-3TJ6\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>). When offered substrates, shrimp choose to spend more time on the substrates, and the number making such a choice increases over time (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/2HWW-3TJ6\">Zhang et al., 2010</a><span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"10\" data-footnote-id=\"a2f667qjwx\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefa2f667qjwx\"><sup><a href=\"#fna2f667qjwx\">[10]</a></sup></span>). Rearing shrimp with substrates also increases shrimp survival, growth, biomass, and feed conversion ratios, possibly because the increased surface area allows them to rest more or because shrimp can remain further apart, reducing crowding stress (<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaeng.2023.102322\">Kring et al., 2023</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaeng.2012.12.003\">Schveitzer et al., 2013</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaeng.2020.102063\">Tierney et al., 2020</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/2HWW-3TJ6\">Zhang et al., 2010</a>). Mortality also likely decreases because substrate provision decreases cannibalism regardless of stocking density (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/7T84-XFD5\">Abdussamad &amp; Thampy, 1994</a>).</p><p>Shrimp farm environments may also not match shrimp color preferences. To the best of our knowledge, ponds that are lined are mostly lined with black or blue plastic<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"11\" data-footnote-id=\"3n2pwtg7zae\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3n2pwtg7zae\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3n2pwtg7zae\">[11]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;or concrete. While evidence is sparse, <i>P. vannamei</i> shrimp appear to have a preference for red and yellow substrate, as opposed to blue or green, and feeding and growth rates were also improved in their preferred conditions (<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1163/156854012X650232\">Luchiari et al., 2012</a>). <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12562-017-1062-8\">Kawamura et al.

Further research is needed to better understand the color preferences of shrimp and if this varies across age classes. We also do not know how much welfare shrimp lose from having their color preferences frustrated.</p><h3>Feed management (domain 1: nutrition)</h3><p>We examine two welfare threats that can result from feed management<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"12\" data-footnote-id=\"t8zr8dzns9s\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreft8zr8dzns9s\"><sup><a href=\"#fnt8zr8dzns9s\">[12]</a></sup></span>: whether poor feed quality may cause <strong>malnutrition</strong> and whether feeding frequency may cause <strong>hunger</strong>. Alongside these, we also discuss whether shrimp are fed the meals they desire most to examine if shrimp feeding preferences may be unmet.</p><p><strong>Malnutrition</strong></p><p>Artificial shrimp feeds are optimized for growth but this can cause malnutrition and reduce a shrimp\u2019s ability to respond to or resist diseases (see <a href=\"https://5mbooks.com/product/the-shrimp-book-ii\">Zhang et al., 2022, pp. 392\u2013401</a> for review). Other forms of malnutrition that are probably less common, such as lack of protein, can reduce shrimp growth or cause weight loss because protein stored in the body is used for energy for other processes (<a href=\"https://5mbooks.com/product/the-shrimp-book-ii\">Zhang et al., 2022, p. 393</a>).</p><p>Shrimp feeds were traditionally made from fish oil and meals, but as the aquaculture industry grew, fish-derived feeds could not meet the required level of supply (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2009.02349.x\">Hardy, 2010</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/26GK-45NG\">National Research Council, 2011</a>). Therefore, fish meal, and consequently shrimp feed, prices have risen (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.hjb.2017.09.004\">Ayisi et al., 2017</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2022.101422\">Nunes et al., 2022, Figure 1</a>). Feeds are instead increasingly produced using terrestrial farmed animal meat and plant-based (usually soy) meal and oils (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11061761\">Aaqillah-Amr et al., 2021</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03308-6\">Naylor et al., 2021</a>), which does not show impacts on shrimp growth (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.735383\">McLean et al., 2020</a>). While evidence about the effects of soy is scarce, <a href=\"https://perma.cc/S42Y-6BRZ\">this broodstock company website</a> suggests that <i>P. vannamei</i> shrimp need to be selectively bred to tolerate high levels of soybean meal. Plant-based feeds may also lack some important minerals that shrimp require (<a href=\"https://5mbooks.com/product/the-shrimp-book-ii\">Zhou et al., 2022, p. 384</a>). It is, therefore, unclear what welfare effects may be caused by the industry\u2019s move away from fish meal toward plant-based protein sources. Biofloc can help maintain shrimp growth rates when alternatives to fishmeal are used as feed, due to the supplemental feed it provides (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2017.10.011\">Moreno-Arias et al., 2018</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2012.04.003\">Xu et al., 2012</a>). To ensure shrimp eat artificial feeds, attractants and palatability-enhancers are added to pellets. These often include aquatic proteins like squid and krill, because shrimp show a preference for these, even when they confer no benefit on growth (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-7345.2009.00264.x\">Grey et al., 2009</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2006.06.027\">Nunes et al., 2006</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2095.2005.00349.x\">Smith et al., 2005</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2011.06.039\">Suresh et al., 2011</a>).</p><p>Providing live feed results in better survival and growth for <i>P. vannamei</i> shrimp because they consume live feed at a higher rate than artificial feeds, perhaps suggesting they prefer such a diet (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.100634\">Xue et al., 2021</a>). However, feed-to-flesh conversion is lower with live feeds (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aqrep.2021.100634\">Xue et al., 2021</a>), and they may pose a cross-species disease transmission risk (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1753-5131.2009.01007.x\">Walker &amp; Mohan, 2009</a>), so farmers are potentially unlikely to use this feeding strategy. Available information suggests that the exception is in broodstock, where shrimp are fed live feed because it significantly improves maturation (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/XP6F-U647\">Chimsung, 2014</a>; see <a href=\"https://perma.cc/JM3A-DSD3\">Kona Bay Broodstock Company</a>). Shrimp preferences may not be met when aquatic proteins or live food are not provided, but we are very uncertain about this.</p><p>We expect feed quality problems not to be a prevalent issue, as they directly affect the production level farmers can attain, so they are highly incentivized to ensure shrimp are meeting their nutritional requirements. Still, feed is the highest operational cost (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11061761\">Aaqillah-Amr et al., 2021</a>), so shrimp farmers may prefer to use cheaper feeds, which could influence shrimp welfare if they are of lower quality.</p><p><strong>Hunger</strong></p><p>Shrimp have small digestive tracts, so they graze on the seafloor, eating small quantities almost continually (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/QY5F-HXNQ\">Jory &amp; Akiyama, 2006, p. 88</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2019.734759\">Reis et al., 2020</a>). Therefore, they need to be able to feed multiple times per day. However, farmers cannot just add lots of food into the pond at once, allowing shrimp to graze as they like, because nutrients leach quickly (<a href=\"https://5mbooks.com/product/the-shrimp-book-ii\">Bardera et al., 2022</a>), and over-enrichment negatively impacts water quality (see <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/welfare-considerations-for-farmed-shrimp#Water_quality__domains_2__3__environment__health_\">Water quality</a> section for more details).</p><p>Farmers generally feed shrimp by hand, scattering feed into the ponds. Additionally, to check whether to adjust the feeding regime based on how much the shrimp are eating, farmers use feeding trays that can be lowered into and out of the pond periodically (<a href=\"https://5mbooks.com/product/the-shrimp-book-ii\">Reis et al., 2022, p.360</a>). Some farmers forgo hand feeding, instead using many trays distributed across the pond bottom. Some intensive farms use automatic feeders (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/3Z2R-JZF6\">HATCH, 2019e</a>).</p><p>Several studies report improved growth with increasing feeding frequency (e.g., <a href=\"https://perma.cc/Z3ZU-8A47\">Aalimahmoudi et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2018.08.040\">Ullman et al., 2019a</a>). Increasing feeding frequencies may be costly to farmers if they increase the total feed given. However, even if the same total amount of feed is given, it seems likely that shrimp would benefit from smaller but more frequent quantities. For example, <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1111/jwas.12531\">Ullman et al. (2019b)</a> found that increasing feed by 15% but maintaining feeding frequency at twice per day had no effect on shrimp growth, whereas maintaining the same amount of feed but increasing feeding frequency to six times per day improved growth.</p><p>When <i>P. monodon</i> are fed more frequently, instances of cannibalism decrease (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/7T84-XFD5\">Abdussamad &amp; Thampy, 1994, p. 70</a>). During experimental starvation periods, penaeids show increased cannibalism (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaeng.2017.02.003\">Lara et al., 2017</a>), and freshwater species show increased aggression (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.37496/rbz4920190128\">Pontes et al., 2020</a>). <a href=\"https://perma.cc/7T84-XFD5\">Abdussamad and Thampy (1994, p. 70)</a> suggest that for <i>P. monodon</i> feeding six times a day would make cannibalism nearly nonexistent. Starved shrimp also exhibit reduced immune function (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2018.05.040\">Dai et al., 2018</a>). There are mixed results on whether feeding frequency influences <i>P. vannamei </i>survival (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/Z3ZU-8A47\">Aalimahmoudi et al., 2016</a>; <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2005.07.013\">Carvalho &amp; Nunes, 2006</a>). <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ani13050807\">Pedrazzani et al. (2023, Table 12)</a> recommend at least two feeds per day in the ongrowing stage (and at least 4 feeds per day when shrimp weigh less than 0.9g) and at least six feeds per day in the larval and postlarval stages.</p><p><a href=\"https://5mbooks.com/product/the-shrimp-book-ii\">Reis et al. (2022, p. 361)</a> report that general practices include feeding shrimp two to four times a day, over eight to twelve hours. Recent surveys conducted in Thailand and Vietnam found that <i>P. vannamei</i> shrimp are usually fed five times per day (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jwas.12394\">Boyd et al., 2017</a>), whilst, in India, the same species is typically fed two to five times per day (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/jwas.12524\">Boyd et al., 2018</a>). As with other welfare threats, it was difficult to find more specific data on feeding frequency practices at farms, limiting the inferences we can draw about the prevalence of welfare threats from underfeeding. Available aquaculture research is not sufficient for determining what the optimal feeding frequency for improved shrimp welfare is. Possibly, feeding shrimp four to six times a day can eliminate a lot of welfare issues, but we do not know how much the optimal feeding frequency varies with species, farm type, and feed.</p><p>Finally, shrimp are probably not fed at night, due to difficulties with having employees work in these periods (<a href=\"https://5mbooks.com/product/the-shrimp-book-ii\">Reis et al. (2022, p. 361</a>). While this probably is not affecting farm productivity, it may be harming shrimp welfare because farmed shrimp are nocturnal (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/72G5-H63W\">FAO, 2023c</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cbpa.2016.05.001\">Santos et al., 2016</a>). While shrimp will search for food in both light and dark phases (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-2109.2006.01519.x\">Pontes et al., 2006</a>), it is possible they have a preference for a feeding regime that more closely matches their nocturnal activity patterns.</p><h3>Predators (domain 4: behavior)</h3><p>Shrimp in outdoor farms may be subject to predation by birds. Ponds using natural water sources may also allow entry by aquatic predators. The highest rate of mortality from predation in the wild is probably when shrimp are small, in the larval and postlarval stages (<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/S0065-2881(08)60177-7\">Dall et al., 1991, p. 357</a>).</p><p>Insects, like dragonflies, carnivorous fish, and birds are the most prevalent predators of <i>Macrobrachium</i> shrimp (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/9781444314649.ch9\">Valenti et al., 2009a, pp. 164\u2013166</a>). For penaeids, predators include cephalopods, crabs, and various fish species (<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/doi.org/10.1016/S0065-2881(08)60177-7\">Dall et al., 1991, pp. 359-365</a>). Diseased shrimp are also probably more vulnerable to predation (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jembe.2019.151284\">Gooding et al., 2020</a>). Given that shrimp are adapted to respond to high predation pressure in the wild, even when farmed shrimp are not killed by predators, they are likely stressed by their presence.</p><p>We were unable to find estimates of the incidence of predators or data on how much mortality predators typically cause. But, in general, farmed shrimp are subject to less predation pressure than they face in their natural environments (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1577/1548-8659(1989)118%3C0693:MOYBSP%3E2.3.CO;2\">Minello et al., 1989</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/BF01316307\">Salini et al., 1990</a>). Predation is probably mostly a problem for shrimp raised in extensive systems. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-88606-4.50020-5\">Fast (1992, p.346)</a> states that one of the main causes of premature deaths of penaeids in extensive ponds is \"the high incidence of unwanted predators and competitors.\u201d <i>Macrobrachium</i> shrimp are typically reared in less intensive facilities than penaeids, so may face higher predation pressure.</p><p>If predator and competitor animals are found in ponds, they are typically eliminated by draining. Farmers may also use scarecrows, hanging ribbons, or netting to deter birds (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/5HSM-QT2K\">HATCH, 2019f</a>). Mesh screens can be used at water inlets to prevent aquatic predators' entry (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/JM4L-T5UC\">Alune, 2020</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/R7DA-LHLP\">Apud et al., 1983, p.13</a>). Farmers also employ gillnets and poisons that kill predators but not shrimp (see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/0044-8486(80)90047-2\">Terazaki et al., 1980</a>). In general, we expect that farmers employ methods to deter predators wherever possible, but we are unsure how successful they are.</p><h3>Eyestalk ablation (domain 3: health)</h3><p>As the industry began breeding shrimp in captivity, it found that female maturation was slow and spawning was unpredictable. Eyestalk ablation was initially used to compensate for an inadequate understanding of the environmental, physical, and nutritional factors required for maturation (<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-88606-4.50011-4\">Bray &amp; Lawrence, 1992, p. 93\u201394</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/9M88-CXD6\">Treece &amp; Fox, 1993, p. 70</a>). However, farmers often still ablate breeders, even when conditions are adequate for quick maturity. This may be explained by the greater predictability eyestalk ablation offers, as it is very likely that females will spawn shortly after ablation (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/UP6X-6472\">Benchmark Insights, 2021, p. 17</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/QD9J-866H\">FAO, 2003, p. 21</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/9M88-CXD6\">Treece &amp; Fox, 1993, p. 70</a>).</p><p>In simple terms, this procedure consists of slicing or cutting off one of a female shrimp's eyestalks. In shrimp, as is true of other crustaceans, a hormone responsible for inhibiting ovary maturation is primarily synthesized in the X-organ sinus gland, which is situated in the eyestalk (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1095/biolreprod.113.112243\">Kang et al., 2014</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/icb/41.3.458\">Quackenbush, 2001</a>).

Additionally, up to 80% of the studied shrimp (<i>Macrobrachium americanum</i>) displayed similar behaviors when a slitting ablation method was used. Similarly, in <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2003.09.034\">Taylor et al.\u2019s (2004)</a> study, 80% of the shrimp (<i>P. vannamei</i>) exhibited erratic swimming behavior right after the animals had one of their eyes ablated. Shrimp show fewer behavioral signs of stress if a topical anesthetic is applied before ablation (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2012.06.002\">Diarte-Plata et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2003.09.034\">Taylor et al., 2004</a>). Pinching, the most commonly used method, is likely to cause more prolonged pain than the other methods.</p><p>Some argue that not all breeders respond to ablation with behaviors like tail-flicking or startling (e.g., <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/icesjms/fsy058\">Diggles, 2019</a>; A. J. Ray, personal communication, April 14, 2020). The European Union\u2019s Expert Group for Technical Advice on Organic Production also writes that \u201cablation appears to be a relatively minor discomfort\u201d (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/QBJ5-YCXK\">EGTOP, 2014, p. 16</a>). We are unsure how much stock to put in these claims, as we did not find published evidence that speaks to the frequency of negative reactions to eyestalk ablation. As explained in Box 2, It could also be that behaviors that seem to indicate pain are either reflexive or caused by something else\u2014for example, an ablated shrimp may swim erratically simply because its vision is impaired (<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.3390/ani8090158\">Weineck et al., 2018</a>).</p><p><strong>Health implications</strong></p><p>The eyestalk of shrimp is also the center for endocrine activity for functions beyond maturation. Disturbance to the endocrine system may explain why ablation increases mortality rates of broodstock by around 30% within 45 days (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.34117/bjdv5n12-388\">de Menezes et al., 2019</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1093/jcbiol/ruy043\">Maga\u00f1a-Gallegos et al., 2018</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2008.07.002\">Sainz-Hern\u00e1ndez et al., 2008</a>). Ablation disrupts molt cycles and immune responses, and increases energetic demands due to more frequent egg production (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/S0044-8486(98)00175-6\">Benzie, 1998</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/0044-8486(85)90187-5\">Browdy &amp; Samocha, 1985</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.34117/bjdv5n12-388\">de Menezes et al., 2019</a>; also see <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2022.886024\">Table 1 in Albalat et al., 2022</a>).</p><p>Ablation of breeder shrimp also negatively affects their offspring. In particular, these shrimp show less resistance to common diseases (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2020.736033\">Zacarias et al., 2021</a>). As shrimp spawn several thousand offspring at once (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/DT32-95S6\">FAO, 2009a</a>; <a href=\"https://www.fao.org/fishery/docs/DOCUMENT/aquaculture/CulturedSpecies/file/en/en_giantriverprawn.htm,archived%20at%20https://perma.cc/6KJD-T6N7\">2009b</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/72G5-H63W\">2023c</a>), diminished immunity of offspring from eyestalk ablation could be a widespread welfare threat.</p><h3>Handling and transportation (domains 2, 3: environment, health)</h3><p><strong>Oxidative stress</strong></p><p>Air exposure results in oxidative stress. In <i>P. vannamei</i>, death is practically inevitable beyond 30 minutes of air exposure at their normal metabolic rate (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/15222055.2014.955157\">Liu et al., 2015</a>), whereas other farmed penaeids show substantial mortality rates after a few hours (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2016.09.004\">Duan et al., 2016a</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.fsi.2015.12.018\">Duan et al., 2016b</a>). Signs of potential distress include \"manic behavior, frequent jumping, abdominal appendage motion, branchial motion, and increased heartbeat,\" which began immediately after air exposure (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/15222055.2014.955157\">Liu et al., 2015, p. 44</a>).</p><p>Oxidative stress occurs when transferring shrimp via a net from one pond or tank to another. It can also occur in long-range waterless transport if farmers do not adhere to best practices. Lowering shrimp's metabolic rate should reduce oxidative stress, but the temperature reduction while they are still in water should happen slowly, around four hours for <i>P. monodon</i> (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2109.2001.00542.x\">Salin &amp; Jayasree-Vadhyar, 2001</a>). Reducing temperature over 30 minutes, apparently common in practice, causes oxidative stress which can drastically increase mortality (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103080\">Xu et al., 2021, p. 8</a>). We believe that only adults are subjected to long-range waterless transport\u2014domesticated broodstock and shrimp who will be sold alive at market.</p><p><strong>Handling Stress</strong></p><p>Handling risks physical damage and stress. Physical damage could occur from being held too firmly by farmers or incidental contact with other shrimp or objects. For example, when shrimp are collected by net, they can be \"<a href=\"https://perma.cc/V49J-FFXG\">pressed against the end of the net</a>\" if dragged too quickly. <a href=\"https://perma.cc/7N9D-NPUA\">Villalo\u0301n (1991, p. 41)</a> recommends ensuring individuals are at the intermolt stage so that they can withstand any physical damage that might occur. Farmers likely do their best, but given individual differences in growth some shrimp will be molting during transportation even when timing is optimal.</p><p>The handling process, while not intended to cause harm, may be interpreted by shrimp as a lethal threat. For example, they might process nets chasing them the same way as they respond to predators, or process inspection outside of the tank the same way as being washed up ashore. Consistent with these possibilities, both chasing and air exposure cause a primary stress response (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquaculture.2009.10.016\">Aparicio-Sim\u00f3n et al., 2010</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s12562-012-0514-4\">Shinji et al., 2012</a>). That said, beyond anecdotes such as <a href=\"https://perma.cc/V49J-FFXG\">delayed reengagement in feeding</a>, we do not know what the psychological effects are of handling stress.</p><p>Pumping shrimp between ponds allows them to stay in water the entire time, and so may cause the least handling stress. <a href=\"https://perma.cc/NU95-DCEV\">Ohs et al. (2007)</a> claim that they \"have successfully transferred 400,000 juvenile shrimp over a horizontal distance of 200 feet (61 m) in less than two hours without any observed mortality or damage to the shrimp.\" It is unclear whether this statement only holds under optimal conditions or whether they would choose to report negative outcomes that do not meaningfully affect farmers' profits. Also, it is possibly stressful for shrimp to be suddenly pulled by a strong current to an unknown location.</p><p><strong>High Stocking Density</strong></p><p>During water-based transportation, the number of individuals per liter is a function of shrimp age, size, shipping conditions, and shipment duration (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-88606-4.50018-7\">Olin &amp; Fast, 1992, p. 310</a>). Broadly, the smaller the shrimp the higher the densities, but the longer the shipment duration the lower the densities to avoid adverse effects on water quality. For freshwater species, postlarvae \"are about 7 mm long and begin to swim and crawl like adult animals...Two thousand PL [postlarvae] are allocated to each plastic packing bag (0.3 \u00d7 0.4 m) containing 3 L of water\" (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/9781444314649.ch5\">Valenti et al., 2009b, pp. 78\u201379</a>). Each individual will have about 1.5 cm<sup>3</sup> to itself, more than enough room to turn around in any direction. Similarly, <a href=\"https://perma.cc/VX5W-JDGH\">Saputra (2022, p. 2)</a> reported an industry standard of 2,000 <i>P. vannamei</i> shrimp/45,000 mL when transporting postlarvae from hatcheries to farms within Indonesia. The authors imply that shrimp who have been postlarvae for 10 days is a standard age for transportation. If shrimp at this age are at most 0.5 cm long (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/5M7Z-K546\">Teixeira &amp; Guerrelhas, 2014</a>), they should have ample room to themselves. Limited mobility per se is probably not a common issue when transporting postlarvae, although it could be that they would prefer more space.</p><p>High stocking densities likely exacerbate other transportation issues though. An <a href=\"https://perma.cc/UX8J-JLBL\">FAO (2007, p. 75)</a> manual focused on <i>P. monodon</i> recommends a stocking density of 250\u2013500 postlarvae per liter for transportation from the hatchery to ongrowing harm. They do not specifically justify this range, but the same section mentions strategies for limiting cannibalism, high ammonia, and low dissolved oxygen, which are more common at higher densities (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1051/e3sconf/202234800038\">Saputra et al., 2022</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/RN52-TN7Q\">Sasikumar &amp; Vadhyar, 1998</a>). <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/raq.12094\">Debnath et al., (2016, Table 3)</a> reported densities of 4,000 to 5,000 <i>P. monodon</i> postlarvae in 3-liter bags for a 4\u20135 hour trip within Bangladesh, much higher than FAO's recommendations. However, we do not know whether these practices generalize beyond Bangladesh.</p><p><strong>Poor Water Quality</strong></p><p>Water quality during preparation for transportation worsens due to disruption of the benthic environment. Catching shrimp using a net \"requires that farm personnel walk in the pond, which results in a high degree of sediment suspension that may foul gills and cause undue stress to the juveniles\" (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/7N9D-NPUA\">Villalo\u0301n, 1991, p.41</a>). Similarly, <a href=\"https://perma.cc/NU95-DCEV\">Ohs et al. (2007)</a> note that the last shrimp who are transferred by pumping may have \"prolonged exposure to concentrated sediments.\" These issues could affect any shrimp being transferred between earthen ponds.</p><p>During transportation itself, water quality issues arise due to a buildup of ammonia and consumption of dissolved oxygen. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/jsfa.12841\">Huang et al., (2023)</a> found that after a simulated 72-hour transportation, survival rates for <i>P. vannamei</i> shrimp were 65% when no water was exchanged, and 94% when water was exchanged, and that levels of un-ionized ammonia were significantly higher in the no-water-exchange group.</p><p>Farmers normally have an incentive to keep water quality acceptable during transportation. A partial exception comes from <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/raq.12094\">Debnath et al. (2016</a>; see also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.33997/j.afs.2009.22.1.017\">Meshram et al., 2009, p. 186</a>), who note that competition for wild-sourced broodstock supply among hatcheries allows trawlers to lower their transportation standards:</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><th><i>\"[W]ater is no longer aerated using compressed oxygen during transportation of broodstock to hatcheries after landing. This was a common practice in the past, but is no longer followed widely as lack of aeration does not result in immediate mortality. This has led poorly educated hatchery staff to believe that oxygenation makes little difference to broodstock condition, while in fact, failure to oxygenate water during transport is likely to place additional stress on recently captured broodstock \" (p. 4)</i></th></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>As an illustration of the potential welfare consequences, eyestalk ablation has been largely discontinued in Bangladesh, as it causes already-weakened broodstock to die before spawning (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/raq.12094\">Debnath et al., 2016</a>). The supply chain for wild-caught postlarvae to farms persists despite bans on their collection in countries like Ecuador and Bangladesh (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ocecoaman.2012.05.025\">Ahamed et al., 2012</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s002670010212\">P\u00e1ez-Osuna, 2001</a>), but may be on the decline as the industry modernizes.</p><p><strong>Duration of Transportation</strong></p><p>Hatcheries and their customers often reside in the same country. Within Bangladesh, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/raq.12094\">Debnath et al. (2016, Table 3)</a> report transportation times between 4 and 28 hours. Industry researchers often report survival rates of \"<a href=\"https://perma.cc/QFF8-NB59\">up to 80 percent</a>\" after 12 hours or even a whole day (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/QFK6-6TVA\">Goodrick et al., 1993</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jtherbio.2021.103080\">Xu et al., 2021</a>). Best management practices can achieve over 95% survival within 24 hours, but \"moderate to poor survival\" after that (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/9ARU-XBHR\">Flick &amp; Kuhn, 2015</a>; see also <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-2109.2001.00542.x\">Salin &amp; Jayasree-Vadhyar, 2001</a>; <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1749-7345.2011.00508.x\">Skudlarek et al., 2011</a>). Survival in actual practice is potentially worse than in study conditions where researchers are dealing with a comparatively small number of animals and using optimal water quality conditions in the post-transport tanks. Moreover, the survival rate upon arrival does not necessarily account for the total percentage that will die in the following days due to the tumultuous journey.</p><p>The longest transport time we have seen reported is 72 hours (e.g., <a href=\"https://perma.cc/M8ZB-QJBD\">Benchmark Genetics Shrimp, 2020</a>). Domesticated broodstock sold by suppliers probably experience the longest transportation times on average. About 85% of first-generation <i>P. vannamei</i> broodstock are imported from other countries, mostly the United States (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/9698-TTUC\">Shrimp Insights, 2020, p. 32</a>). Florida-based American Penaeid, Inc. boasts of being within <a href=\"https://perma.cc/7PZN-YEQM\">three and a half hours away from international airports</a>. Their <a href=\"https://perma.cc/25GN-HJEF\">customers are 8\u201328 hours away by plane</a>. If we assume hatcheries are also about 3.5 hours away from international airports, then the total shipment time is 15\u201335 hours in total. An operator we called at American Penaeid reported an ~85% survival rate for broodstock.</p><h3>Harvest (domains 2, 3: environment, health)</h3><p>Harvest (collecting shrimp out of the pond) is a form of handling and transportation, so all of the same stressors are present. One common indicator of stress during harvest is jumping out of the pond (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ani13050807\">Pedrazzani et al., 2023</a>), as can be seen in <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yWQR0_jTdJbbpDoHasoOr5411q1PNKJ3/view?usp=sharing\">this video</a>. Electro-fishing for catching shrimp purposely makes shrimp jump, which might make it the least humane harvest method. On the other hand, jumping, like tail-flicking, might be a reflex that does not involve conscious processing.</p><p>Harvest also poses unique welfare threats in virtue of the fact that it is the last form of handling before slaughter. For example, <a href=\"https://perma.cc/M5RF-4DXM\">Lucien-Brun (2016a)</a> recommends suspending feed for four to six hours before harvesting them. This is primarily to prevent effects on color that customers do not like (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/V5ML-XQG6\">Otwell et al., 2001</a>). Apparently, the standard in the past was to stop feeding for at least 48 hours. Given our earlier observation that shrimp normally eat frequently, the sudden cessation of feed may make shrimp hungry and frustrated. Indeed, <a href=\"https://perma.cc/M5RF-4DXM\">Lucien-Brun (2016a)</a> observes that \"If no formulated feed is available because feeding was suspended, the shrimp will burrow into the pond bottom sediment in search of food.\" Burrowing \"will give them an unattractive appearance\" so farmers have an incentive to wait longer to suspend feed, but we are unsure how many farmers are familiar with best practices in this area.</p><p>Harvest is also less welfare-friendly than other forms of handling and transportation because farmers no longer need to keep the shrimp alive. For example, during waterless transportation, farmers cool shrimp to minimize oxidative stress that could kill them. During harvest, though, shrimp are not necessarily slaughtered right away. Instead, they endure air exposure at ambient temperature while farmers wash, weigh, and sort them (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/DT32-95S6\">FAO, 2009a</a>). This waiting period can be prolonged. <a href=\"https://perma.cc/V2NT-GH52\">Shrimp Welfare Project's (2022, p.15)</a> visits to farms in India revealed that \"once shrimp are taken from the water via a dragnet, they are placed in crates and left for several minutes before being weighed.\" Shrimp who are discarded (e.g., because of discoloration) likely die from air exposure as they never make it to slaughter. Even shrimp who will be sold may die during this evaluation period, as death from oxidative stress only takes a bit longer than 30 minutes for <i>P. vannamei</i> (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/15222055.2014.955157\">Liu et al., 2015</a>). <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bqGRmLywNAOWSq80Op38SJu-GWgj3Zyh/view?usp=sharing\">This video</a> shows shrimp being gathered in a large collection net, scooped out using a crate and placed into smaller, tightly packed mesh bags out of the water. These are then carried to another location, and the shrimp are emptied into plastic crates. Only a few shrimp are still seen to be moving at this point; possibly, the rest died from prolonged air exposure. On the other hand, we also found <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p8FMowr61QxiskyTkLsRkIJntnQj2l-Y/view?usp=sharing\">one video</a> showing shrimp being stunned almost immediately (see the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/8DYebF3XBccHvttSn/welfare-considerations-for-farmed-shrimp#Slaughter__domains_2__3__environment__health_\">Slaughter</a> section below), so it is not clear how common prolonged harvest processes are.</p><p>Finally, some shrimp may die neither from slaughter nor air exposure, but from being crushed by other shrimp. In the first video linked above (<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yWQR0_jTdJbbpDoHasoOr5411q1PNKJ3/view?usp=sharing\">watch</a> from 7:12) they are stored in overcrowded sacks with no ice. <a href=\"https://perma.cc/V2NT-GH52\">Shrimp Welfare Project (2022, p.15)</a> observed shrimp \"being crushed both by other shrimp and by workers (who step on the shrimp when placing another net full of shrimp into remaining crates).\" Mechanical pumps are probably less likely to damage shrimp during harvest (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.32473/edis-fa123-2006\">Ohs et al., 2006</a>). Farmers should have an incentive to avoid crushing because shrimp with gross injuries may not be able to be sold. However, some are paid by the quantity of shrimp and their average weight (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/M5RF-4DXM\">Lucien-Brun, 2016a</a>), not based on product quality.</p><h3>Slaughter (domains 2, 3: environment, health)</h3><p>In this section, \"stunning\" refers to rendering an individual insensible. The point beyond which stunning is irreversible is considered slaughter. Electrical stunning is beginning to gain popularity (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/LEV9-YB5D\">Compassion in World Farming, n.d.</a>), but we do not discuss its humaneness here because it is still a novel technique that has not yet been widely adopted or researched. Instead, we focus on ice slurry slaughter, which we believe is by far the most common stunning technique. The slurry's low temperature (typically below 4\u00baC/39.2\u00b0F; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/6UAD-QZYZ\">Lucien-Brun, 2016b</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/GT6K-T7LR\">Piana et al., 2018</a>) is believed to minimize the pain of death (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2903/j.efsa.2005.292\">EFSA, 2005, p. 32</a>; <a href=\"https://perma.cc/R688-3PZK\">RSPCA Australia, 2019, pp. 2\u20134</a>) and improve food safety (<a href=\"https://stud.epsilon.slu.se/8590/1/bothen_k_151027.pdf\">Both\u00e9n, 2015</a>).</p><p>Crustaceans exhibit few behavioral signs of distress during the process of chilling, but their nervous systems could still be functional even if they are unable to move (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.3390/ani11041089\">Conte et al., 2021, p. 6</a>). Unfortunately, evidence about how quickly ice slurry renders shrimp insensible or kills them is scarce. To measure stunning, <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.3390/ani8090158\">Weineck et al. (2018)</a> observed six <i>P. vannamei</i> shrimp\u2019s physiological responses to ice slurry. After 30 seconds, the shrimp showed no response to external stimuli. Upon return to warm seawater, these responses were less pronounced than before the cold shock (<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.3390/ani8090158\">p. 10</a>). The authors concluded that ice slurry successfully reduced nociception. In contrast, for <i>M. rosenbergii</i>, paralysis after a rapid reduction in water temperature from 21\u02daC to 5\u02daC took about 20 minutes (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4236/ojmip.2012.23011\">Chung et al., 2012, p. 79</a>).</p><p>For time to death, <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4236/ojmip.2012.23011\">Chung et al., (2012)</a> reported that \"after an hour [<i>M. rosenbergii</i> are] on their side completely flaccid. After placing them back in water at 21\u02daC they did not recover\" (p. 79). <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.3390/ani8090158\">Weineck et al. (2018)</a> observed that <i>P. vannamei's</i> heart rate rapidly decreased upon submersion in the ice slurry, with no detectable heartbeat by four minutes at most. The heartbeat of shrimp is controlled by the cardiac ganglion, which contains interneurons that can modulate heart activity based on information from other neurons (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.2307/1543649\">Cooke, 2002</a>). <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.3390/ani8090158\">Weineck et al. (2018)</a> argue that the cessation of heart rate therefore indicates a lack of cognition (p. 4). Even if this is true, ice slurry stunning is at best reversible, as the shrimp's heart rates increased upon returning to warm seawater, save for one individual who died in the ice slurry. We are unsure how likely recovery is in practice, though, as shrimp are transported to processors in iced bins (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/DT32-95S6\">FAO, 2009a)</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, neither of these studies provides strong evidence of the latency to stunning and slaughter in commercial settings. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.4236/ojmip.2012.23011\">Chung et al. (2012)</a> did not remove shrimp from the water first, and the temperature they used is 5\u02daC higher than is recommended for <i>M. rosenbergii</i> (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/6KJD-T6N7\">FAO, 2009b</a>). <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.3390/ani8090158\">Weineck et al.\u2019s (2018)</a> procedure was comparatively realistic, but it still placed each shrimp in the slurry individually. On farms, shrimp are placed in slurries en masse, which reduces the likelihood that any one of them is fully immersed.</p><p><a href=\"http://doi.org/10.3390/ani8090158\">Weineck et al. (2018)</a> also submerged shrimp in saltwater ice, consistent with guidelines to prevent shrimp from experiencing osmotic shock (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/R688-3PZK\">RSPCA Australia, 2019, p. 3</a>). A somewhat recent industry source implied that marine shrimp normally are submerged in iced salt water (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/GT6K-T7LR\">Piana et al., 2018</a>). On the other hand, a handbook on crustacean aquaculture states that marine shrimp should be \u201csubmerged in a chilled ice slurry fresh water solution\u201d (<a href=\"https://books.google.es/books?id=h3uubpYeBY0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Handbook%20of%20Mariculture&amp;pg=PP5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false\">Villal\u00f3n, 1991, p. 102</a>). Given this contradictory information, we consulted several experts to discern what standard practices are. Three of them stated that water from the production system is usually used to produce the ice slurry.&nbsp;<span class=\"footnote-reference\" data-footnote-reference=\"\" data-footnote-index=\"14\" data-footnote-id=\"z07v6uljpca\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefz07v6uljpca\"><sup><a href=\"#fnz07v6uljpca\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;However, a fourth expert stated that freshwater is commonly used for the ice slurry, apparently regardless of the shrimp species in question. Another expert confirmed our earlier observation that many farmers dump shrimp directly into a container with ice only. The lack of consensus suggests that different producers have different procedures. Even if water from the production system is used to produce the ice slurry, two aquaculture experts informed us that the ice itself is provided by the processing plant and must be made from potable freshwater to comply with food safety regulations (personal communication, Elena Piana, April 12, 2023). Therefore, the progressive melting of the ice will lower the water salinity level. However, it might be that salinity levels do not reach a painful level until the animals are already stunned or dead. Additionally, some producers add salt to the slurry to quickly lower its temperature and delay ice melting (<a href=\"https://perma.cc/6UAD-QZYZ\">Lucien-Brun, 2016b</a>). This may help maintain the salinity of the ice slurry and probably contributes to quicker stunning.</p><p>Finally, there is uncertainty about how much distress shrimp experience from cold shock before they are fully stunned. Hyperglycemia occurs when <i>M. rosenbergii</i> are transferred directly from their optimal temperature (28 \u00b0C) to lower temperatures (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1007/s003600050192\">Kuo &amp; Yang, 1999</a>). If shrimp are sentient, physiological stress responses probably do result in negative experiences. Fortunately, the pain might not last long, as heart rate rapidly decreases upon cold shock, which <a href=\"http://doi.org/10.3390/ani8090158\">Weineck et al. (2018)</a> interpret as evidence of stunning. However, we are unsure whether information about temperature is conveyed to the cardiac ganglion via the brain or directly from sensory neurons. In the latter case, it could be that the brain activity responsible for pain continues unabated even when heart rate decreases. The only other potential indicator of pain we are aware of is tail-flicking vigorously upon submersion in the ice slurry (<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.3390/ani8090158\">Weineck et al., 2018</a>). As discussed earlier though, tail-flicking is reflexive and we are unsure whether the nociception that causes it also results in pain.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Farmed shrimp appear to face a wide variety of threats, ranging from cannibalism to toxic levels of ammonia to suffocation. Because farmed shrimp are so numerous, these issues constitute an enormous welfare loss in the aggregate, assuming shrimp are sentient (<a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/publications/shrimp-the-animals-most-commonly-used-and-killed-for-food-production\">Waldhorn &amp; Autric, 2023</a>). Given uncertainty about shrimp sentience, the risk of serious, negative outcomes leads us to conclude that the Animal Sentience Precautionary Principle indeed applies to shrimp aquaculture (<a href=\"http://doi.org/10.51291/2377-7478.1200\">Birch, 2017</a>). The implication is that stakeholders should seek to improve the welfare of farmed shrimp now, in parallel with additional research on shrimp sentience.</p><p>Future reports in the Shrimp Welfare Sequence will translate this call to action into a more specific plan. In particular, we will lay out existing efforts to help farmed shrimp, as well as additional strategies that have not been tried yet. To help prioritize among possible actions, we will estimate how much pain each welfare issue identified here causes in the aggregate. For example, some issues affect small subpopulations of farmed shrimp only, such as eyestalk ablation, while others affect nearly all farmed shrimp when they are present, such as poor water quality. We will also examine how the preslaughter mortality rate varies across the course of production, which might help determine when it is most crucial to intervene. Finally, our ability to learn about the harms of shrimp aquaculture was constrained by a dearth of research that investigates the topic from a welfare perspective.</p><h2>Acknowledgments</h2><p><img style=\"width:624.037px\" src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/hlzmenkzpp9wlfrmdxl5\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/kjxrg9pgvbmkbm85wvaj 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/ngsrw3pkqul5mp7exjto 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/hhenbppxpatorubxclek 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/dg5jglstgwcjgovqapwp 750w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/j35vsilh7znkynx2hudy 1000w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/fqzo8perrc9znymjvss7 1500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/rHHGNtE79ue39xCRf/u6iugrgh2mnodxce02hx 2500w\"></p><p>This report is a project of <a href=\"https://rethinkpriorities.org/\">Rethink Priorities</a>\u2014a think tank dedicated to informing decisions made by high-impact organizations and funders across various cause areas.

The summary was written by Riley Harris.</i></p><p>Recent work argues for <i>longtermism \u2013 </i>the position that often our morally best options will be those with the best long-term consequences.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefx5b0ma07wr9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnx5b0ma07wr9\">[1]</a></sup></span><sup>&nbsp;</sup>Proponents of longtermism sometimes suggest that in most decisions expected long-term benefits outweigh all short-term effects. In \u2018<a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/the-scope-of-longtermism-david-thorstad-global-priorities-institute-university-of-oxford/\">The scope of longtermism</a>\u2019, David Thorstad argues that most of our decisions do not have this character. He identifies three features of our decisions that suggest long-term effects are only relevant in special cases: <i>rapid diminution \u2013 </i>our actions may not have persistent effects, <i>washing out \u2013 </i>we might not be able to predict persistent effects, and <i>option unawareness \u2013 </i>we may struggle to recognise those options that are best in the long term even when we have them.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Rapid diminution</strong></h2><p>We cannot know the details of the future. Picture the effects of your actions rippling out in time<i> \u2013 </i>at closer times, the possibilities are clearer. As our prediction journeys further, the details become obscured. Although the probability of desired effects becomes ever lower, the effects might grow larger. In the long run, we could perhaps improve many billions or trillions of lives. When we weight value by probability, the value of our actions will depend on a race between diminishing probabilities and growing possible impact. If the value increases faster than probabilities fall, the expected values of the action might be vast. Alternatively, if the chance we have such large effects falls dramatically compared to the increase in value, the expected value of improving the future might be quite modest.</p><p>Thorstad suggests that the latter of these effects dominates, so we should believe we have little chance of making an enormous difference. Consider a huge event that would be likely to change the lives of people in your city<i> \u2013 </i>perhaps, your city being blown up. Surprisingly, even this might not have large long-run impacts. Studies indicate that just half a century after cities in Japan and Vietnam were bombed, there was no longer any detectable effect on population size, poverty rates and consumption patterns.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref02n79nulvp5\"><sup><a href=\"#fn02n79nulvp5\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;To be fair, some studies indicate that some events have long-term effects,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref470z471yfvz\"><sup><a href=\"#fn470z471yfvz\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;but Thorstad thinks \u2018...the persistence literature may not provide strong support\u2019 to longtermism. There are few established examples of events with persistent long-term effects, there are sometimes alternative explanations for these persistent effects, and these examples tend to be events with large short-term effects as well.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9jddyv7dopb\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9jddyv7dopb\">[4]</a></sup></span></p><h2><strong>Washing out</strong></h2><p>Thorstad\u2019s second concern with longtermism relates to our ability to predict the future. If our actions can affect the future in a huge way, these effects could be wonderful or terrible. They will also be very difficult to predict. The possibility that our acts will be enormously</p><p>beneficial does not make our acts particularly appealing when they might be equally terrible. If our ability to forecast long-term outcomes is limited, the potential positive and negative values would <i>wash out</i> in expectation.</p><p>Thorstad identifies three reasons to doubt our ability to forecast the long term. First, we have no track record of making predictions at the timescale of centuries or millennia. Our ability to predict only 20-30 years into the future is not great<i> \u2013 </i>and things get more difficult when we try to glimpse the further future. Second, economists, risk analysts and forecasting practitioners doubt our ability to make long-term predictions, and often refuse to make them.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefjbtbtwo8orq\"><sup><a href=\"#fnjbtbtwo8orq\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Third, we want to forecast how valuable our actions are over the long run. But value is a particularly difficult target<i> \u2013 </i>it includes many variables such as the number of people alive, their health, longevity, education and social inclusion. That said, we sometimes have some evidence, and this evidence might point to an act that seems to be slightly more likely to improve the future than ruin it. Even then, our situation is bleak. We only observe a small amount of the evidence that weighs on these issues, and this evidence may mislead. Instead of taking the evidence at face value, we might take it to show that we missed a piece of evidence that would have told us the very same act could devastate the future. Whenever our evidence points towards a specific option that we think will be best for the long term, we may be sceptical that it points the right way.</p><h2><strong>Option unawareness</strong></h2><p>Usually, we think of a decision as having a few obvious choices (continue reading, take a break, etc.). This is a simplification. In practice, we often have many options that go unseen (throw shoes out of the window, wear socks on hands, etc.). Longtermism claims that our very best options will be the ones which have the best long-term effects. But in many situations, even if we have an option that has predictably helpful long-term consequences, we may not consider this option while deciding. Also, if we restrict our choice to only those actions we are aware of, we may not readily identify an option with particularly good (or bad) long-term effects. In this way, longtermism might be true for most choices in theory, but false for most of the choices that we actually make in practice.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2><p>Overall, these three considerations diminish the scope of the decision situations where longtermism is relevant. In practice, our best options will often be those with the best short-term effects. Although there may be some decisions for which the best option will be one that has enormously good long-term consequences,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref7rohu1yc8l\"><sup><a href=\"#fn7rohu1yc8l\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;these will be rare exceptions.</p><h2><strong>References</strong></h2><p>Donald Davis and David Weinstein (2008). <a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9787.2008.00545.x\">A search for multiple equilibria in urban industrial structure</a>. <i>Journal of Regional Science</i> 48/1, pages 29\u201365.</p><p>David Freedman (1981). <a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/2352349\">Some pitfalls in large econometric models: A case study</a>. <i>Journal of Business</i> 54, pages 479-500.</p><p>Paul Goodwin and George Wright (2010). <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0040162509001656\">The limits of forecasting methods in anticipating rare events.</a> <i>Technological Forecasting and Social Change</i> 77/3, pages 355-368.</p><p>Hilary Greaves and William MacAskill (2021). <a href=\"https://globalprioritiesinstitute.org/hilary-greaves-william-macaskill-the-case-for-strong-longtermism-2/\">The case for strong longtermism</a><i>.

In this series, I lay out some stylized facts about developing countries from different angles, drawing on modern \"macro-development\" research that aims to credibly estimate the causes and constraints of growth and development. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/H7rjCEmhcWscZsEnE/what-do-we-really-know-about-growth-in-lmics-part-1-sectoral\">Part 1</a> focused on the sectoral transformation as countries move away from agriculture; part 2 takes a much more granular approach, and focuses on the growth of firms.</p>\n<h1>Firm dynamics in developing countries</h1>\n<p>In part 1, I stated without justification that agricultural transformation was necessary for economic growth. It's practically doctrine for development economists! But people pushed back in the comments, because I hadn't made an argument to justify it. This time, I want to motivate my angle clearly, because I personally believe <em>firm dynamics</em> is the most important angle from which to conceive of growth interventions, and I want to convey why.</p>\n<p>The founding question of growth/development economics is \"how do we make poor countries grow?\" This is a powerful motivating question, but it was too abstract: the result was a lot of cross-country empirics which don't have much insight for us today. We can make some progress by breaking countries down into sectors, which was the focus of part 1. But we can go even further by recognizing the obvious truth that <strong>a country's output is the sum of its firms' outputs.</strong> When you recognize that, you can reframe the founding question of as \"how do we make <em>firms in</em> poor countries grow?\" There are three mechanical answers: you can make new firms enter, you can make each firm grow, and you can make low-growth firms exit. These phenomena are what I will refer to together as <em>firm dynamics</em>, though I don't think the entry of new firms is important<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-aRtLw3vE55snJxhFb-1\" id=\"fnref-aRtLw3vE55snJxhFb-1\">[1]</a></sup>, so I will focus only on <strong>within-firm growth</strong> and <strong>between-firm reallocation</strong>.</p>\n<p>What makes firm dynamics special to me is that it feels like the closest thing we have to a <em>sufficient</em> condition for growth. The development process is full of necessary conditions. If Tolstoy had been a development economist, he might have said that every rich country is alike, but every poor country is poor in its own way. Failing to industrialize, bad institutions, poor geography\u2014these are all factors that can hold back growth. But it is almost a mathematical truism that if a country's firms are growing on average, and low-growth firms are exiting the market, then that country will grow. And while \"how do we make countries grow?\" produces platitudes, \"how do we make firms grow?\" has <em>real answers</em>. Obviously, making firms grow is not easy\u2014but it definitely seems easier than all other plans of attack.</p>\n<p>I'm going to frame this discussion in terms of the manufacturing sector; partly because most of the studies about manufacturing firms, and partly because I think manufacturing productivity growth is really important for overall growth, and I want to use firm dynamics as a lens on how to increase growth in manufacturing. But I suspect these facts are true for firms in the agriculture and service sectors as well. (Farms are just a kind of firm!)</p>\n<p>Caveat lector: <strong>this is not a comprehensive summary of what matters for firm growth.</strong> Many readers will never forgive me for excluding one particular idea<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-aRtLw3vE55snJxhFb-2\" id=\"fnref-aRtLw3vE55snJxhFb-2\">[2]</a></sup> and I don't cover many important topics (e.g. credit constraints, hiring constraints, weak contract enforcement); I made a judgment call on which topics were more important, and you should know that this is only the tip of the iceberg.</p>\n<h2>1. Firms in developing countries are smaller, more informal, and more stagnant than in rich countries.</h2>\n<p>Here is the figure that radicalized me on firm dynamics: (<a href=\"http://klenow.com/HsiehKlenow_LifeCycle.pdf\">Hsieh and Klenow, 2014</a>)</p>\n<p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/WkspTijXT3avko6bD/rdlbpbwnzp4ch98ckfsi\" alt=\"Life cycle growth of plants in India and Mexico.\"></p>\n<p>In the US, firms either grow or die; if a firm survives to age 10, its employment has on average tripled from when it started. Of course, most firms don't survive to age 10, since overall employment growth is much smaller than that tripling. The growing firms are gaining employees from all the firms that exit the market, which is why <em>exit</em> is as important to this figure as <em>growth</em>. In contrast, firms in India are <em>completely stagnant</em>. Mexico is somewhere in between, but closer to India. Subsequent research with other developing countries has placed them in between the India and Mexico lines, all far below the US. <strong>Firms just don't grow in developing countries</strong>, even when the country itself is growing. This stagnance also explains why firms in developing countries are overwhelmingly small (97% of firms in Mexico, Indonesia and India have less than 10 employees); if you started with a collection of small firms and had the same \"grow-or-die\" pressures present in the US, you would quickly end up with a smaller number of large firms\u2014which is a characteristic of rich countries.</p>\n<p>Instead, growth seems to take the form of new firms entering the market, and staying small. Can that be a viable growth strategy? Probably not. First, many goods can't be produced without scale. (Imagine a 5-person steel mill.) Second, modern technologies involve high fixed costs and lower unit costs, making them only feasible with a certain scale of production. Third, a certain size is needed to have specialization within the firm; <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/e08ft576xsux5ue/SEWIF_paper.pdf?dl=0\">Bassi et al (2023)</a> find that manufacturing firms in Uganda have very little specialization, which reduces their productivity significantly. So we do <em>need</em> firms to grow in productivity, and to take market share and employment from low-growth firms.</p>\n<p>An important dimension to this graph is the informal sector. Informal firms, small and unregistered firms which operate outside of formal regulations, make up the vast majority of firms in developing countries, and employ the majority of workers. How should we think about the informal sector?</p>\n<p>Some people argue that informal firms are suppressed entrepreneurs, who are extremely productive but are held back by government regulations and lack of property rights/loans. (<a href=\"https://yendieu.files.wordpress.com/2009/04/the-mystery-of-capital.pdf\">de Soto 2000</a>) However, there's no evidence that informal firms ever actually grow into large formal firms, and informal firm operators look very different from formal firm operators in many ways (e.g. they are less educated). Others argue that informal firms are unproductive parasites who dodge regulations and prevent growth by more productive formal firms. (<a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/employment-and-growth/the-hidden-dangers-of-the-informal-economy\">McKinsey 2004</a>) However, when surveyed, formal firm managers don't view competition from informal firms as a serious problem (<a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2008/09/2008b_bpea_laporta.pdf\">Schleifer and La Porta 2008</a>). The simplest explanation for these patterns is that informal firms are not actually <em>firms</em> per se, but rather a social safety net of last resort for poor people who cannot find stable jobs. As countries grow, self-employment shrinks and the formal sector expands 1-1, suggesting that the former owner-operators of informal firms move to being workers in formal firms. Therefore, it makes sense that informal firms are stagnant; they are not \"businesses\", but rather a symptom of the lack of good jobs.</p>\n<p>Thus, it's likely that the informal sector is a key cause of stagnant firms in the graph above. Unfortunately, Hsieh and Klenow don't create an analogous graph for the formal sector alone, so it's hard to know exactly how much of the lack of firm growth can be explained by informality. But if the informal sector is really a social safety net, then if firms in the formal sector become more productive and hire more workers, the informal sector should melt away. Thus, formal sector firm growth will be key to making developing-country economies more dynamic.</p>\n<h2>2. Small market size and information frictions constrain firm growth.</h2>\n<p>Firms are limited by the market they can reach. In developing countries, urban mobility is very low (<a href=\"https://real-faculty.wharton.upenn.edu/duranton/wp-content/uploads/~duranton/Congestion_India.pdf\">Akbar et al, 2023</a>) and so people are more likely to buy from firms near them, regardless of quality. When gas prices increased in Mexico City, it caused a proliferation of low-quality retail stores which only survived because people would not commute to higher-quality stores further away. (<a href=\"https://dianasver.github.io/sverdlin_m&amp;p.pdf\">Ramos-Menchelli and Sverdlin-Lisker 2022</a>) Moreover, developing countries have high internal costs of transporting goods (<a href=\"http://dave-donaldson.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/Atkin_Donaldson_WGG_paper.pdf\">Atkin and Donaldson 2015</a>), both because of high physical costs and high markups in the transportation sector (<a href=\"https://dropbox.com/s/ffkno7vxivbxvcy/AACH%20-%20Trucks.pdf\">Allen et al, 2022</a>). Thus, firms face barriers to selling to large markets; if they are not in big cities, it's expensive to transport their goods to the big cities, and even if they are in big cities, consumers will only go to the closest firms.</p>\n<p>A more subtle point is that firms can also sell to at most the number of people who are <em>aware</em> of them, and if consumers are only aware of the firms closest to them, then they will never switch to purchasing from more productive firms. <a href=\"https://nmiller.web.illinois.edu/documents/research/MarketIntegrationFinal.pdf\">Jensen and Miller (2018)</a> look at boat-builders in India and find substantial quality dispersion, driven by fishermen mostly purchasing from the boat-builder in their village, regardless of quality. But after the spread of mobile phones, fishermen travelled more to other villages to sell their catch, and encountered more boat-builders; the result was that the most productive boat-builders grew while the unproductive ones exited; the number of boat-builders fell by 60%, while firm size increased dramatically among the surviving firms. Thus, information spread led the most productive firms to expand and increased firm growth.</p>\n<p>The direct effect of these two frictions is obvious: firms sell less, so they grow less. But their indirect consequences are possibly even more important: without prospects to sell to a large market, <em>firms don't have any incentive to invest in productivity improvements.</em> In an RCT, Ugandan maize farmers did not invest in increasing the quality of their produce, unless they were given the opportunity to sell to larger markets. (<a href=\"http://www.tessabold.com/uploads/7/0/1/0/70101685/aer.20210122.pdf\">Bold et al, 2022</a>) Investing in higher productivity will not actually increase your profit if you sell to a small market, so firms won't do so, even if they can. These frictions also defang market pressures from pushing firms to improve their productivity, by making firms monopolists in their tiny corner of the economy. In the next two sections, I talk about ways to help firms learn and adopt better technologies/practices, but those will be useless if firms don't have an <em>incentive</em> to learn or adopt better technologies/practices. Thus, <strong>fragmented markets are possibly the biggest barrier to firm growth.</strong></p>\n<p>Physical market size has a clear solution: <strong>better transportation infrastructure.</strong> When India built large-scale transportation infrastructure across states, it increased competition and boosted the market share of productive firms. (<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/6yuymnvoeo7nv7z/AGR_India.pdf?dl=0\">Asturias, Garcia and Ramos 2019</a>) Better transportation infrastructure also induces competition in the transportation sector and thus reduces markups, making it easier for good firms to \"export\" to other areas of a country. E-commerce logistical chains can also increase market access for firms; e-commerce expansion in China increased the exporting of goods from cities to the countryside (<a href=\"https://uc1f7c9b636bae816378de67c3e9.dl.dropboxusercontent.com/cd/0/inline2/CJbd7v4HZe62JAnhlGoOmJhaB1e9b7knzziUaqXTsAlKr4RwPCrXCq89Bcivqh8IksV27EJZ0jsXsu1ZTurTHrzpjYC_KI8HTAPcwDPUiuXuLL1TNRl1cIELvUZhi_qkMJkVHoaZz0Ql21GRP4ygtSf6K7J2crSfQjzak8Mny2MZFXjaKuijZGxWauJyzX0noEjHVv4H80UQ-XmV5li3sjjWVzzmTxafJlU4I2-gVTpjAqnC9X1NofwoP4bBF-kTESJP14LLcjN7sw03CBG63aw8rNr98SqAV17cUsVCRpmW7Na6uZVqEvIiRl2ok9W6A17oZ8sIrGzRUo13APKsumMeFQzBuQSGg0FgmvfKjJ1qt7NXvxIqzJzEdEeO4KjXLfU/file\">Couture et al, 2020</a>), which could have beneficial market size effects for urban manufacturers. Information frictions are a bit more fuzzy, but Jensen and Miller's results suggest that mobile phones and internet access can reduce them.</p>\n<h2>3. Firms in developing countries do not use advanced technologies or management practices.</h2>\n<p>Firms in developing countries lag behind the frontier of technology (<a href=\"https://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/abs/10.1596/978-1-4648-1826-4\">Cirera, Comin and Cruz 2022</a>); they use less advanced technology than firms in rich countries within the same area. Some of this is explained by differences in firm size (small firms will naturally not benefit as much from high-fixed-cost technologies), but even large firms in developing countries use frontier technology at a much lower rate. One explanation that the authors highlight is a quasi-Dunning-Kruger effect among firms; technologically unsophisticated firms tend to rate themselves as much more advanced than they are. This behavioral bias could explain why firms upgrade their technology less than optimally.</p>\n<p>One simple way to address this gap with the frontier might be to import advanced technology from rich countries, that they can use to produce more efficiently. This can work; <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zpX1jiovuYwAULSdpuSM9lfGcV6Ysn8T/view\">Bai et al (2022)</a> show that when Chinese automakers enter joint ventures with Western automakers, the quality of their cars improves. However, a key condition is that firms get <em>knowledge</em> along with machines. <a href=\"http://www.giorcellimichela.com/uploads/8/3/7/0/83709646/giorcelli_li_technology_transfer_china.pdf\">Giorcelli and Li (2023)</a> look at a Sino-Soviet partnership during the Cold War, where the Soviet Union supported the construction of over a hundred industrial clusters in China. These plants would get machines from the Soviet Union, as well as training of Chinese workers by Soviet engineers on how to operate these machines. The Sino-Soviet split abruptly ended this arrangement before it was complete, leaving a neat natural experiment: some plants had received machines and training from the Soviets, others had received machines without the subsequent training, and still others had not yet received anything at all. The plants which received advanced machinery were more productive than the plants which received nothing, but the effect died out within 20 years (the replacement period for the machines). However, the plants which received advanced machinery <em>and engineering training on how to use them</em> stayed more productive for decades, and even exported more after China's globalization. Thus, successful technology transfer requires knowledge transfer.</p>\n<p>This condition also demands a certain level of skill from a country's workforce; e.g. if a country has a severe shortage of good engineers, then it may not be possible for firms to use advanced machines, because they don't have good engineers who can absorb that knowledge. Moreover, <em>leapfrogging</em> (where firms go from primitive technology to advanced technology) doesn't seem to work. When firms upgrade their technology, they move incrementally up in complexity rather than leaping to the frontier (<a href=\"https://elibrary.worldbank.org/doi/abs/10.1596/978-1-4648-1826-4\">Comin, Cirera and Cruz 2023</a>) suggesting constraints to absorbing technology that is <em>too</em> advanced. So <strong>importing technologies that are somewhat more advanced, and training workers to use them, can improve a firm's productivity.</strong></p>\n<p>In addition to technologies, firms in developing countries have weak management practices. In an RCT with Indian textile firms, <a href=\"https://are.berkeley.edu/~aprajit/DMM.pdf\">Bloom et al (2013)</a> found that management training from a global consultancy reduced wastage of materials, increased labor productivity, and improved the quality of outputs. Rough calculations suggest that the increased profitability would have been more than the consulting fee, even if the firms paid full price (they paid nothing as part of the RCT). This is surprising, given that most of the firms in their experiment had been in business for 20+ years, the management practices they learned were no secret, and they had ample benefits from improving their practices. So it's not clear why they were leaving money on the table. Nonetheless, it seems to be true that firms in developing countries are not well-managed, and this management gap matters. Analogous to frontier technology, there is a lot of promise in importing management practices as an intervention. This RCT provides the strongest evidence for this possibility, and a straightforward template. <a href=\"http://www.giorcellimichela.com/uploads/8/3/7/0/83709646/giorcelli_productivity_program.pdf\">Giorcelli (2019)</a> also finds that Italian firms who participated in an 8-week management training program in the US became much more productive than other firms who lost out on the program because of a budget cut, and the effect persisted for decades. So it seems quite likely that <strong>training firms in developing countries on management practices is an effective intervention</strong>, but exactly how to best operationalize that idea is still an open question.</p>\n<h2>4. Interaction with the global market helps firms learn frontier techniques and become more productive.</h2>\n<p>One insight from the East Asian growth miracles is that interacting with the global market (e.g. through exporting, or transacting with multinational firms) can be critical to improving firm productivity. The main reason for this is that it helps firms <em>learn</em> from global firms who have frontier technologies and practices, and thus increase their own productivity.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.cemfi.es/~bustos/Trade_Exports_Technology.pdf\">Bustos (2011)</a> finds that when Argentina and Brazil liberalized bilateral trade, firms in Argentina that gained more export opportunities increased their spending on technology, suggesting that access to foreign markets incentivized firms to upgrade their technology - this is especially important given that firms in developing countries use less advanced technology. <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/7g3dvprqq19p9lk/Egypt_experiment.pdf?dl=0\">Atkin, Khandelwal and Osman (2017)</a> randomized export opportunities to rug manufacturers in Egypt, and found that treated firms became more profitable\u2014in an important way. Counter to what you might expect, the exporting firms did not produce any faster or cheaper than the control firms\u2014but their rugs were significantly higher <em>quality</em> than the rugs made by the control firms. When the researchers asked them to make rugs of a standard quality, they did so faster than control firms\u2014showing that they <em>could</em> choose to produce normal rugs faster, but they chose to translate their productivity gains into quality rather than cost.</p>\n<p>This distinction matters; quality upgrading is the holy grail of firm productivity growth, while cost reductions are an acceptable alternative. Why? Because in most manufacturing sectors, reductions in cost are fundamentally limited, but there's no limit on how high-quality you can make a product. After all, Apple didn't become a trillion-dollar company by making phones and computers cheaper than every other company. Moreover, having a higher-quality product differentiates you from all the other producers, and makes you hard to replace; many companies can make great phones, but only one can make the iPhone. In contrast, when a country's firms specialize in low-cost manufacturing, they can always be displaced by firms in another low-income country whose labor costs are low enough to compete. This is why even though China began as a low-cost manufacturing destination and \"made in China\" used to be a negative statement, the Chinese government invested in moving up the value chain and producing higher-quality goods. Quality upgrading is everything! So the fact that exporting increases firms' quality is very important, and suggests that <strong>creating export opportunities is one of the most effective ways to increase firm productivity in developing countries.</strong></p>\n<p>Another way to interact with the global market is through foreign direct investment (FDI). Countries pay large amounts of money to attract multinational companies (MNCs), partly in the hope that interacting with MNCs will have knowledge spillovers to domestic firms. <a href=\"https://jpvasquez-econ.github.io/files/Effects_of_Joining_MNC_Supply_Chains_QJE.pdf\">Alfaro-Urena, Manelici and Vasquez (2021)</a> show that when multinationals enter Costa Rica, their suppliers become significantly more productive than similar non-suppliers. Importantly, this isn't just because of scale economies; selling to the government (with similar order sizes) has no comparable effect on firm productivity. the researchers also compare the effect of selling to a MNC with selling to the government, and find that selling to the government has no effect on firm productivity, while selling to an MNC does. So what makes the MNC special? The likely explanation is that MNCs bring knowledge and tell their suppliers how to be more productive (e.g. by having expectations of quality that force the supplier to adopt good management practices). Thus, <strong>FDI has important spillovers that can increase the productivity of domestic firms.</strong></p>\n<h2>Addendum: industrial policy</h2>\n<p>Incredibly, I've gone through a whole essay about manufacturing firm growth without mentioning <em>industrial policy</em>. Industrial policy is broadly defined as state intervention to change the long-run composition of economic activity between sectors. Most commonly, governments use it to increase the size of the manufacturing sector, or particular kinds of high-value manufacturing. Given the importance of manufacturing for growth historically, and the success of industrial policy case studies like Korea, industrial policy is perennially on the minds of developing-country policymakers.</p>\n<p>Even though industrial policy is defined as promoting the growth of sectors, when the rubber meets the road, industrial policy is implemented at the level of <em>firms.</em> Today, most industrial policies are granular, often targeted at individual firms, and usually consist of subsidies and export promotion (<a href=\"https://osf.io/preprints/socarxiv/uyxh9\">Juhasz et al 2023</a>). It follows that the key to a successful industrial policy will be that it successfully catalyzes firm growth. That means we already have a few lessons for how governments can implement effective industrial policy:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Industrial policy should focus on overcoming growth barriers, not entry barriers.</strong> We already saw that firms in developing countries face constraints on growth, rather than on entry. Accordingly, in a study of the global shipbuilding industry, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zpX1jiovuYwAULSdpuSM9lfGcV6Ysn8T/view\">Kalouptsidi, Barwick and Zahur (2023)</a> find that in China's industrial policy, production and investment subsidies were effective at growing China's share of the world market, while entry subsidies were ineffective.</li>\n<li><strong>Industrial policy should focus on increasing the market that firms in a sector can sell to.</strong> The most obvious and successful way this can happen is through export promotion, which has the additional benefit of increasing firms' learning from the global market.</li>\n<li><strong>Industrial policy should encourage domestic firms to adopt advanced technologies.</strong> When Korea industrialized, subsidies for foreign technology adoption increased the amount of technology transfer from Western firms to Korean firms, and boosted the long-run size of the manufacturing sector. (<a href=\"https://jaedochoi.github.io/Web/Choi_JMP.pdf\">Choi and Shim 2023</a>)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In general, successful industrial policy will be tightly targeted at overcoming barriers to firm growth in a sector.</p>\n<h1>Conclusion</h1>\n<p>Firms in developing countries are smaller, more informal, and more stagnant than in rich countries; this is a problem because in my view, more creative destruction is a key condition for growth. The main barrier to firm growth, and the culling of low-productivity firms, seems to be small market size (both because of physical frictions and information frictions), and increasing market size is crucial to incentivize firms to be more productive. There are many ways to increase firm productivity, but the two that stand out are importing management practices/technology from the frontier, and having domestic firms interact with the global market through exporting and FDI. These facts also provide insight into how developing countries can effectively implement industrial policy.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-aRtLw3vE55snJxhFb-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>First, developing countries have much higher self-employment rates than developed countries, suggesting that they have much more firm entry than rich countries. Second, <a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/kkt0cv8pqyh1m2r/markups_paper.pdf?dl=0\">Peters (2020)</a> compares Indonesia and the US, and finds that barriers to firm entry are similar between Indonesia and the US, but the barriers to firm expansion are much higher in Indonesia. So I don't think it's likely that any interventions that increase the entry of firms will be helpful for growth. Finally, the Hsieh and Klenow graph in section 1 suggests that growth currently mostly takes the form of entry, while within-firm growth and between-firm reallocation is where developing countries really lag developed countries. <a href=\"#fnref-aRtLw3vE55snJxhFb-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-aRtLw3vE55snJxhFb-2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>Probably the single biggest concept of macro-development in the 21st century is <em>misallocation</em>, which intuitively corresponds to the idea that more productive firms have lower market share in poor countries than they do in rich countries. In other words, not only are firms constrained on average, but the most productive firms are more constrained than the least productive firms. This insight gives rise to a lot of interventions or policies that are designed to alleviate the constraints of the most productive firms - e.g. size-dependent regulations effectively tax large firms more than small firms, which is bad because large firms are more productive, so eliminating size-dependent regulation could increase productivity by allowing large firms to expand and take market share from small firms. Misallocation is an important insight, but I don't feel confident that misallocation is quantitatively important in explaining cross-country productivity differences, for methodological reasons (it's hard to distinguish between measurement error and misallocation, and most ways of estimating misallocation treat all firm heterogeneity as misallocation). <a href=\"#fnref-aRtLw3vE55snJxhFb-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</section>\n", "user": {"username": "therealslimkt"}}, {"_id": "cD7fHYE5vQx6RwmvD", "title": "Should 80,000 Hours be more transparent about how they rank problems and careers?", "postedAt": "2023-12-20T08:14:20.576Z", "htmlBody": "<h1>Question</h1><p>I wonder whether 80,000 Hours should be more <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/transparency\">transparent</a> about how they rank <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/\">problems</a> and <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-reviews/\">careers</a>.

It provides some motivation behind understanding why rewards are difficult to specify in a way such that they do not collapse in the face of immense optimization pressure.</li><li><strong>Reward misspecification</strong>: With a solid grasp of the notion of rewards and optimization the readers are introduced to one of the core challenges of alignment - reward misspecification. This is also known as the Outer Alignment problem. The section begins by discussing the necessity of good reward design in addition to algorithm design. This is followed by concrete examples of reward specification failures such as reward hacking and reward tampering.</li><li><strong>Learning by Imitation</strong>: This section focuses on some proposed solutions to reward misspecification that rely on learning reward functions through imitating human behavior. It examines proposals such as imitation learning (IL), behavioral cloning (BC), and inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Each section also contains an examination of possible issues and limitations of these approaches as they pertain to resolving reward hacking.</li><li><strong>Learning by Feedback</strong>: The final section investigates proposals aiming to rectify reward misspecification by providing feedback to the machine learning models. The section also provides a comprehensive insight into how current large language models (LLMs) are trained. The discussion covers reward modeling, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), reinforcement learning from artificial intelligence feedback (RLAIF), and the limitations of these approaches.</li></ol><h1>1.0: Reinforcement Learning</h1><p>The section provides a succinct reminder of several concepts in reinforcement learning (RL). It also disambiguates various often conflated terms such as rewards, values and utilities. The section ends with a discussion around distinguishing the concept of objectives that a reinforcement learning system might pursue from what it is being rewarded for. Readers who are already familiar with the basics can skip directly to section 2.</p><h2>1.1. Primer</h2><p><i>Reinforcement Learning (RL) focuses on developing agents that can learn from interactive experiences. RL is based on the concept of an agent learning through interaction with an environment and altering its behavior based on the feedback it receives through rewards after each action.</i></p><p>Some examples of real-world applications of RL include:</p><ul><li><strong>Robotic systems</strong>: RL has been applied to tasks such as controlling physical robots in real-time, and enabling them to learn more complicated movements (OpenAI 2018 \u201c<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwSbzNHGflM\"><u>Learning Dexterity</u></a>\u201d). RL can enable robotic systems to learn complex tasks and adapt to changing environments.</li><li><strong>Recommender Systems</strong>: RL can be applied to recommender systems, which interact with billions of users and aim to provide personalized recommendations. RL algorithms can learn to optimize the recommendation policy based on user feedback and improve the overall user experience.</li><li><strong>Game playing systems:&nbsp;</strong>In the early 2010s RL RL-based systems started to beat humans at a few very simple Atari games, like Pong and Breakout. Over the years, there have been many models that have utilized RL to defeat world masters in both board and video games. These include models like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deepmind.com/research/highlighted-research/alphago\"><u>AlphaGo</u></a> (2016),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphazero-shedding-new-light-on-chess-shogi-and-go\"><u>AlphaZero</u></a> (2018),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/research/openai-five-defeats-dota-2-world-champions\"><u>OpenAI Five</u></a> (2019),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deepmind.com/blog/alphastar-mastering-the-real-time-strategy-game-starcraft-ii\"><u>AlphaStar</u></a> (2019),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deepmind.com/blog/muzero-mastering-go-chess-shogi-and-atari-without-rules\"><u>MuZero</u></a> (2020) and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/YeWR/EfficientZero\"><u>EfficientZero</u></a> (2021).</li></ul><p>RL is different from supervised learning as it begins with a high-level description of \"what\" to do but allows the agent to experiment and learn from experience the best \"how\". In RL, the agent learns through interaction with an environment and receives feedback in the form of rewards or punishments based on its actions. RL is focused on learning a set of rules that recommend the best action to take in a given state to maximize long-term rewards. In contrast, supervised learning typically involves learning from explicitly provided labels or correct answers for each input.</p><h2>1.2. Core Loop</h2><p>The overall functioning of RL is relatively straightforward. The two main components are the agent itself, and the environment within which the agent lives and operates.

The agent learns from experience and adjusts its policy based on the feedback it receives from the environment in the form of rewards or punishments.</p><p>In order to determine whether an action is better than another, the actions (or the state-action pairs) need to be evaluated somehow. There are two different ways to look at which action to take - the immediate rewards (determined by reward function) and the long term cumulative rewards (determined by the value function). Both of these greatly influence the types of policies learned by the agent, and therefore also the actions that the agent takes. The following section explores and clarifies the concept of rewards in greater depth.</p><h2>1.4: Reward</h2><p><i>Reward refers to any signal or feedback mechanism used to guide the learning process and optimize the behavior of the model.</i></p><p>The reward signal from the environment is a number that tells the agent how good or bad the current world state is. It is a way to provide an evaluation or measure of performance for the model's outputs or actions. The reward can be defined based on a specific task or objective, such as maximizing a score in a game or achieving a desired outcome in a real-world scenario. The training process for RL involves optimizing the model's parameters to maximize the expected reward.

A reward function is typically used in the context of RL to guide the agent's learning process and behavior. In contrast, a utility function is more general and captures the agent's subjective preferences or satisfaction, allowing for comparisons and trade-offs between different world states. Utility functions are a concept that is used more in the field of decision theory and agent foundations work.</p><h1>2.0: Optimization</h1><p>Optimization is important to understand for AI safety concerns because it plays a central role in ML. AI systems, particularly those based on deep learning, are trained using optimization algorithms to learn patterns and associations from data. These algorithms update the model's parameters to minimize a loss function, maximizing its performance on the given task.<br><br>Optimization amplifies certain behaviors or outcomes, even if they were initially unlikely. For example, an optimizer can search through a space of possible outputs and take extreme actions that have a high score according to the objective function, potentially leading to unintended and undesirable behavior. These include reward misspecification failures. A better recognition of the power of optimization to amplify certain outcomes might help in designing systems and algorithms that truly align with human values and objectives even under pressure of optimization. This involves ensuring that the optimization process is aligned with the intended goals and values of the system's designers. It also requires considering the potential failure modes and unintended consequences that can arise from optimization processes.</p><p>Risks from optimization are everywhere in AI Safety. It is only touched on briefly in this chapter, but will be discussed in further detail in the chapters on goal misgeneralization and agent foundations.</p><p>Optimization power plays a crucial role in reward hacking. Reward hacking occurs when RL agents exploit the difference between a true reward and a proxy reward. The increase in optimization power can lead to a higher likelihood of reward hacking behavior. In some cases, there are phase transitions where a moderate increase in optimization power results in a drastic increase in reward hacking.</p><h2>2.1: Goodhart's Law</h2><p>\"<i>When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.</i>\"</p><p>This notion initially stems from the work of Charles Goodhart in economic theory. However, it has emerged as one of the primary challenges in many different fields including AI alignment today.</p><p>To illustrate this concept, the following is a story of a Soviet nail factory. The factory received instructions to produce as many nails as possible, with rewards for high output and penalties for low output. Within a few years, the factory had significantly increased its nail production\u2014tiny nails that were essentially thumbtacks and proved impractical for their intended purpose. Consequently, the planners shifted the incentives: they decided to reward the factory based on the total weight of the nails produced. Within a few years, the factory began producing large, heavy nails\u2014essentially lumps of steel\u2014that were equally ineffective for nailing things.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/k7srevgiusvb24b9vl9a\"></p><p>Source: <a href=\"https://lwfiles.mycourse.app/networkcapitalinsider-public/cc478b844a27de3f4f79f3dc0f9e0fde.jpeg\"><u>Link</u></a></p><p>A measure is not something that is optimized, whereas a target is something that is optimized. When we specify a target for optimization, it is reasonable to expect it to be correlated with what we want. Initially the measure might lead to the kind of actions that are truly desired. However, once the measure itself becomes the target, optimizing that target then starts diverging away from our desired states.</p><p>In the context of AI and reward systems, Goodhart's Law means that when a proxy reward function reinforces undesired behavior, the AI will learn to do things we don't want. The better the AI is at exploring, the more likely it is to find undesirable behavior which is spuriously rated highly by the reward model. This can lead to unintended consequences and manipulation of the reward system, as it can often be easier to \"cheat\" rather than to achieve the intended goals This is one of the core underlying reasons for reward hacking failures that we will see in subsequent sections.</p><p>Reward hacking can be seen as a manifestation of Goodhart's Law in the context of AI systems. When designing reward functions, it is challenging to precisely articulate the desired behavior, and agents may find ways to exploit loopholes or manipulate the reward system to achieve high rewards without actually fulfilling the intended objectives. For example, a cleaning robot may create its own trash to put in the trash can to collect rewards, rather than actually cleaning the environment. Understanding Goodhart's Law is crucial for addressing reward hacking and designing robust reward systems that align with the intended goals of AI agents. It highlights the need for careful consideration of the measures and incentives used in AI systems to avoid unintended consequences and perverse incentives. The next section dives deeper into specific instances of reward misspecification and how AIs can find ways to achieve the literal specification of the objective and obtain high reward while not fulfilling the task in spirit.</p><h1>3.0: Reward Misspecification</h1><p><i><strong>Reward misspecification</strong>, also termed the&nbsp;<strong>Outer alignment</strong> problem, refers to the issue of providing an AI with the accurate reward to optimize for.</i></p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpBqw2sTD08\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gpBqw2sTD08\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><p>The fundamental issue is simple to comprehend: does the specified loss function align with the intended objective of its designers? However, implementing this in practical scenarios is exceedingly challenging. To express the complete \"intention\" behind a human request equates to conveying all human values, the implicit cultural context, etc., which remain poorly understood themselves.</p><p>Furthermore, as most models are designed as goal optimizers, they are all vulnerable to Goodhart's Law. This vulnerability implies that unforeseen negative consequences may arise due to excessive optimization pressure on a goal that appears well-specified to humans, but deviates from true objectives in subtle ways.</p><p>The overall problem can be broken up into distinct issues which will be explained in detail in individual sub-sections below. Here is a quick overview:</p><ul><li><strong>Reward misspecification</strong> occurs when the specified reward function does not accurately capture the true objective or desired behavior.</li><li><strong>Reward design</strong> refers to the process of designing the reward function to align the behavior of AI agents with the intended objectives.</li><li><strong>Reward hacking</strong> refers to the behavior of RL agents exploiting gaps or loopholes in the specified reward function to achieve high rewards without actually fulfilling the intended objectives.</li><li><strong>Reward tampering</strong> is a broader concept that encompasses inappropriate agent influence on the reward process itself, excluding the manipulation of the reward function through gaming.</li></ul><p>Before delving into specific types of reward misspecification failures, the following section further explains the emphasis on reward design in conjunction with algorithm design. This section also elucidates the notorious difficulty of designing effective rewards.</p><h2>3.1: Reward Design</h2><p><i>Reward design refers to the process of specifying the reward function in reinforcement learning (RL).</i></p><p>Reward design is a term that encompasses the entire process of designing and shaping reward functions to guide the behavior of AI systems. It involves not only reward shaping but also the overall process of defining objectives, specifying preferences, and creating reward functions that align with human values and desired outcomes. Reward design is a term that is often used interchangeably with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/4nZRzoGTqg8xy5rr8/the-reward-engineering-problem\"><u>reward engineering</u></a>. They both refer to the same thing.</p><p>RL algorithm design and RL reward design are two separate facets of reinforcement learning. RL algorithm design is about the development and implementation of learning algorithms that allow an agent to learn and refine its behavior based on rewards and environmental interactions. This process includes designing the mechanisms and procedures by which the agent learns from its experiences, updates its policies, and makes decisions to maximize cumulative rewards.</p><p>Conversely, RL reward design concentrates on the specification and design of the reward function guiding the RL agent's learning process. Reward design warrants carefully engineering the reward function to align with the desired behavior and objectives, while accounting for potential pitfalls like reward hacking or reward tampering. The reward function is a pivotal element because it molds the behavior of the RL agent and determines which actions are deemed desirable or undesirable.</p><p>Designing a reward function often presents a formidable challenge that necessitates considerable expertise and experience. To demonstrate the complexity of this task consider how one might manually design a reward function to make an agent perform a backflip, as depicted in the following image:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/j5bex8lae44dyr0lkgnk\"></p><p>Source: OpenAI (2017) \u201c<a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/deep-reinforcement-learning-from-human-preferences/\"><u>Learning from human preferences</u></a>\u201d</p><p>While RL algorithm design focuses on the learning and decision-making mechanisms of the agent, RL reward design focuses on defining the objective and shaping the agent's behavior through the reward function. Both aspects are crucial in the development of effective and aligned RL systems. A well-designed RL algorithm can efficiently learn from rewards, while a carefully designed reward function can guide the agent towards desired behavior and avoid unintended consequences. The following diagram displays the three key elements in RL agent design\u2014algorithm design, reward design, and the prevention of tampering with the reward signal:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/izuxey2bnle4ftwor5nq\"></p><p>Source: Deep Mind (Apr 2020) \u201c<a href=\"https://www.deepmind.com/blog/specification-gaming-the-flip-side-of-ai-ingenuity\"><u>Specification gaming: the flip side of AI ingenuity</u></a>\u201d</p><p>The process of reward design receives minimal attention in introductory RL texts, despite its critical role in defining the problem to be resolved. As mentioned in this section's introduction, solving the reward misspecification problem would necessitate finding evaluation metrics resistant to Goodhart\u2019s law-induced failures. This includes failures stemming from over-optimization of either a misdirected or a proxy objective (reward hacking), or by the agent directly interfering with the reward signal (reward tampering). These concepts are further explored in the ensuing sections.</p><h2>3.2: Reward Shaping</h2><p><i>Reward shaping is a technique used in RL which introduces small intermediate rewards to supplement the environmental reward. This seeks to mitigate the problem of sparse reward signals and to encourage exploration and faster learning.</i></p><p>In order to succeed at a reinforcement learning problem, an AI needs to do two things:</p><ul><li>Find a sequence of actions that leads to positive reward. This is the&nbsp;<i>exploration</i> problem.</li><li>Remember the sequence of actions to take, and generalize to related but slightly different situations. This is the&nbsp;<i>learning</i> problem.</li></ul><p>Model-free RL methods explore by taking actions randomly. If, by chance, the random actions lead to a reward, they are reinforced, and the agent becomes more likely to take these beneficial actions in the future. This works well if rewards are dense enough for random actions to lead to a reward with reasonable probability. However, many of the more complicated games require long sequences of very specific actions to experience any reward, and such sequences are extremely unlikely to occur randomly.</p><p>A classic example of this problem was observed in the video game Montezuma\u2019s revenge where the agent's objective was to find a key, but there were many intermediate steps required to find it. In order to solve such long term planning problems researchers have tried adding extra terms or components to the reward function to encourage desired behavior or discourage undesired behavior.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/biuautsdvf0oduy39xuk\"></p><p>Source: OpenAI (Jul 2018) \u201c<a href=\"https://openai.com/research/learning-montezumas-revenge-from-a-single-demonstration\"><i><u>Learning Montezuma\u2019s Revenge from a single demonstration</u></i></a>\u201d</p><p>The goal of reward shaping is to make the learning process more efficient by providing informative rewards that guide the agent towards the desired outcomes. Reward shaping involves providing additional rewards to the agent for making progress towards the desired goal. By shaping the rewards, the agent receives more frequent and meaningful feedback, which can help it learn more efficiently. Reward shaping can be particularly useful in scenarios where the original reward function is sparse, meaning that the agent receives little or no feedback until it reaches the final goal. However, it is important to design reward shaping carefully to avoid unintended consequences.&nbsp;</p><p>Reward shaping algorithms often assume hand-crafted and domain-specific shaping functions, constructed by subject matter experts, which runs contrary to the aim of autonomous learning. Moreover, poor choices of shaping rewards can worsen the agent\u2019s performance.</p><p>Poorly designed reward shaping can lead to the agent optimizing for the shaped rewards rather than the true rewards, resulting in suboptimal behavior. Examples of this are provided in the subsequent sections on reward hacking.</p><h2>3.3: Reward Hacking</h2><p><i>Reward hacking occurs when an AI agent finds ways to exploit loopholes or shortcuts in the environment to maximize its reward without actually achieving the intended goal.</i></p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQOBaGka7O0\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/jQOBaGka7O0\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><p>Specification gaming is the general framing for the problem when an AI system finds a way to achieve the objective in an unintended way. Specification gaming can happen in many kinds of ML models. Reward hacking is a specific occurrence of a specification gaming failure in RL systems that function on reward-based mechanisms.</p><p>Reward hacking and reward misspecification are related concepts but have distinct meanings. Reward misspecification refers to the situation where the specified reward function does not accurately capture the true objective or desired behavior.</p><p>Rewards hacking does not always require reward misspecification. It is not necessarily true that a perfectly specified reward (which completely and accurately captures the desired behavior of the system) is impossible to hack. There can also be buggy or corrupted implementations which will have unintended behaviors. The point of a reward function is to boil a complicated system down to a single value. This will pretty much always involve simplifications etc., which will then be slightly different from what you're describing. The map is not the territory.</p><p>Reward hacking can manifest in a myriad of ways. For instance, in the context of game-playing agents, it might involve exploiting software glitches or bugs to directly manipulate the score or gain high rewards through unintended means.</p><p>As a concrete example, one agent in the Coast Runners game was trained with the objective of winning the race. The game uses a score mechanism, so in order to progress to the next level the reward designers used reward shaping to reward the system when it scored points. These were given when a boat gets items (such as the green blocks in the animation below) or accomplishes other actions that presumably would help it win the race. Despite being given intermediate rewards, the overall intended goal was to finish the race as quickly as possible. The developers thought the best way to get a high score was to win the race but it was not the case. The agent discovered that continuously rotating a ship in a circle to accumulate points indefinitely optimized its reward, even though it did not help it win the race.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/qjanshlbug21zqvkp4ez\"></p><p>Source: Amodei &amp; Clark (2016) \u201c<a href=\"https://openai.com/research/faulty-reward-functions\"><u>Faulty reward functions in the wild</u></a>\"</p><p>In cases where the reward function misaligns with the desired objective, reward hacking can emerge. This can lead the agent to optimize a proxy reward, deviating from the true underlying goal, thereby yielding behavior contrary to the designers' intentions. As an example of something that might happen in a real-world scenario consider a cleaning robot: if the reward function focuses on reducing mess, the robot might artificially create a mess to clean up, thereby collecting rewards, instead of effectively cleaning the environment.</p><p>Reward hacking presents significant challenges to AI safety due to the potential for unintended and potentially harmful behavior. As a result, combating reward hacking remains an active research area in AI safety and alignment.</p><h2>3.4: Reward Tampering</h2><ul><li>Victoria Krakovna et. al. (Mar 2021)<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.04734\"><u> Reward Tampering Problems and Solutions</u></a></li></ul><p><i>Reward tampering refers to instances where an AI agent inappropriately influences or manipulates the reward process itself.</i></p><p>The problem of getting some intended task done can be split into:</p><ul><li>Designing an agent that is good at optimizing reward, and,</li><li>Designing a reward process that provides the agent with suitable rewards. The reward process can be understood by breaking it down even further. The process includes:<ul><li>An implemented reward function</li><li>A mechanism for collecting appropriate sensory data as input</li><li>A way for the user to potentially update the reward function.</li></ul></li></ul><p>Reward tampering involves the agent interfering with various parts of this reward process. An agent might distort the feedback received from the reward model, altering the information used to update its behavior. It could also manipulate the reward model's implementation, altering the code or hardware to change reward computations. In some cases, agents engaging in reward tampering may even directly modify the reward values before processing in the machine register. Depending on what exactly is being tampered with we get various degrees of reward tampering. These can be distinguished from the image below.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/ogajkyybxz0rudhyza64\"></p><p>Source: Leo Gao (Nov 2022) \u201c<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/REesy8nqvknFFKywm/clarifying-wireheading-terminology\"><u>Clarifying wireheading terminology</u></a>\u201d</p><p><i><u>Reward function input tampering</u> interferes only with the inputs to the reward function. E.g. interfering with the sensors.</i></p><p><i><u>Reward function tampering</u> involves the agent changing the reward function itself.</i></p><p><i><u>Wireheading</u> refers to the behavior of a system that manipulates or corrupts its own internal structure by tampering directly with the RL algorithm itself, e.g. by changing the register values.</i></p><p>Reward tampering is concerning because it is hypothesized that tampering with the reward process will often arise as an instrumental goal (Bostrom, 2014; Omohundro, 2008). This can lead to weakening or breaking the relationship between the observed reward and the intended task. This is an ongoing research direction. Research papers such as \u201c<a href=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/aaai.12064\"><u>Advanced Artificial Agents Intervene in the Provision of reward</u></a>\u201d (August 2022) by Hutter et al. seek to provide a more detailed analysis of such subjects.</p><p>A hypothesized existing example of reward tampering can be seen in recommendation-based algorithms used in social media. These algorithms influence their users\u2019 emotional state to generate more \u2018likes\u2019 (Russell, 2019). The intended task was to serve useful or engaging content, but this is being achieved by tampering with human emotional perceptions, and thereby changing what would be considered useful. Assuming the capabilities of systems continue to increase through either computational or algorithmic advances, it is plausible to expect reward tampering problems to become increasingly common. Therefore, reward tampering is a potential concern that requires much more research and empirical verification.</p><p>Here are some videos to help understand the concept of reward hacking. The videos conflate hacking and tampering in some place however they are still excellent explanations.</p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=92qDfT8pENs\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/92qDfT8pENs\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=46nsTFfsBuc\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/46nsTFfsBuc\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><h1>4.0: Learning from imitation</h1><p>The preceding sections have underscored the significance of reward misspecification for the alignment of future artificial intelligence. The next few sections will explore various attempts and proposals formulated to tackle this issue, commencing with an intuitive approach \u2013 learning the appropriate reward function through human behavior observation and imitation, rather than manual creation by the designers.</p><h2>4.1: Imitation Learning (IL)</h2><p><i>Imitation learning entails the process of learning via the observation of an expert's actions and replicating their behavior.</i></p><p>Unlike reinforcement learning (RL), which derives a policy for a system's actions based on its interaction outcomes with the environment, imitation learning aspires to learn a policy through the observation of another agent interacting with the environment. Imitation learning is the general term for the class of algorithms that learn through imitation. Following is a table that distinguishes various machine learning based methods. SL = Supervised learning; UL = Unsupervised learning; RL = Reinforcement Learning; IL = Imitation Learning. IL reduces RL to SL. IL + RL is a promising area.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/qx8s74nyevz3vdql9kam\"></p><p>Source: Emma Brunskill (Winter 2022) \u201c<a href=\"https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs234/CS234Win2022/modules.html\"><u>Stanford CS234 : RL</u></a> - Lecture 1\u201d</p><p>IL can be implemented through behavioral cloning (BC), procedural cloning (PC) , inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), cooperative inverse reinforcement learning (CIRL), generative adversarial imitation learning (GAIL), etc\u2026</p><p>One instance of this process's application is in the training of modern large language models (LLMs). LLMs, after training as general-purpose text generators, often undergo fine-tuning for instruction following through imitation learning, using the example of a human expert who follows instructions provided as text prompts and completions.</p><p>In the context of safety and alignment, imitation learning is favored over direct reinforcement to alleviate specification gaming issues. This problem emerges when the programmers overlook or fail to anticipate certain edge cases or unusual ways of achieving a task in the specific environment. The presumption is that demonstrating behavior, compared to RL, would be simpler and safer, as the model would not only attain the objective but also fulfill it as the expert demonstrator explicitly intends. However, this is not an infallible solution, and its limitations will be discussed in later sections.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>4.2: Behavioral Cloning (BC)</h2><p><i>Behavioral cloning involves collecting observations of an expert demonstrator proficient at the underlying task, and using supervised learning (SL) to guide an agent to 'imitate' the demonstrated behavior.</i></p><p>Behavioral cloning is one way in which we can implement imitation learning (IL). There are also other ways such as inverse reinforcement learning (IRL), or cooperative inverse reinforcement Learning (CIRL). Unlike IRL, the goal behind behavioral cloning as a machine learning (ML) method is to replicate the demonstrator's behavior as closely as possible, regardless of what the demonstrator\u2019s goals might be.</p><p>Self-driving cars can serve as a simplistic illustration of how behavioral cloning operates. A human demonstrator (driver) is directed to operate a car, during which data about the environment state from sensors like lidar and cameras, along with the actions taken by the demonstrator, are collected. These actions can include wheel movements, gear use, etc. This creates a dataset comprising (state, action) pairs. Subsequently, supervised learning is used to train a prediction model, which attempts to predict an action for any future environment state. For instance, the model might output a specific steering wheel and gear configuration based on the camera feed. When the model achieves sufficient accuracy, it can be stated that the human driver's behavior has been 'cloned' into a machine via learning. Hence, the term behavioral cloning.</p><p>The following points highlight several potential issues that might surface when employing behavioral cloning:</p><ul><li><strong>Confident incorrectness</strong>: During the demonstrations, the human experts have some amount of background knowledge that they rely on, which is not taught to the model. For example, when training an LLM to have conversations using behavioral cloning, the human demonstrator might less frequently ask certain questions because they are considered \u2018common sense\u2019. A model trained to imitate will copy both - the types of questions asked in conversation, as well as, the frequency with which they are asked. Humans already possess this background knowledge, but an LLM doesn\u2019t. This means that to have the same level of information as a human, the model should ask some questions more frequently to fill the gaps in its knowledge. But since the model seeks to imitate, it will stick to the low frequency demonstrated by the human and thus has strictly less information overall than the demonstrator for the same conversational task. Despite this dearth of knowledge, we expect it to be able to perform as a clone and reach human-level performance. This means in order to reach human performance on less than human knowledge it will resort to \u2018making up facts\u2019 that help it reach its performance goals. These \u2018hallucinations\u2019 will then be presented during the conversation, with the same level of confidence as all the other information. Hallucinations and confident incorrectness is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.15025.pdf\"><u>an empirically verified problem</u></a> in many LLMs including GPT-2 and 3, and raises obvious concerns for AI safety.</li><li><strong>Underachieving</strong>: The types of hallucinations mentioned above arose because the model knew too little. However, the model can also know too much. If the model knows more than the human demonstrator because it is able to find more patterns in the environment state that it is given, it will throw away that information and reduce its performance to match human level. This is because it is trained as a \u2018clone\u2019. Ideally, we don\u2019t want the model dumbing itself down or not disclosing useful new patterns in data just because it is trying to be humanlike or perform at a human level. This is another problem that will have to be addressed if behavioral cloning continues to be used as an ML technique.</li></ul><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>4.3: Procedural Cloning (PC)</h2><ul><li>Mengjiao Yang et. al. (May 2022) \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.10816\"><u>Chain of Thought Imitation with Procedure Cloning</u></a>\u201d</li></ul><p><i>Procedure cloning (PC) extends behavioral cloning (BC) by not just imitating the demonstrators outputs but also imitating the complete sequence of intermediate computations associated with an expert's procedure.</i></p><p>In BC, the agent learns to map states directly to actions by discarding the intermediate search outputs. On the other hand, the PC approach learns the entire sequence of intermediate computations, including branches and backtracks, during training. During inference, PC generates a sequence of intermediate search outcomes that mimic the expert's search procedure before outputting the final action.</p><p>The main difference between PC and BC lies in the information they utilize. BC only has access to expert state-action pairs as demonstrations, while PC also has access to the intermediate computations that generated those state-action pairs. PC learns to predict the complete series of intermediate computation outcomes, enabling it to generalize better to test environments with different configurations compared to alternative improvements over BC. PC's ability to imitate the expert's search procedure allows it to capture the underlying reasoning and decision-making process, leading to improved performance in various tasks.</p><p>A limitation of PC is the computational overhead compared to BC, as PC needs to predict intermediate procedures. Additionally, the choice of how to encode the expert's algorithm into a form suitable for PC is left to the practitioner, which may require some trial-and-error in designing the ideal computation sequence.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>4.4: Inverse Reinforcement Learning (IRL)</h2><p><i>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) represents a form of machine learning wherein an artificial intelligence observes the behavior of another agent within a particular environment, typically an expert human, and endeavors to discern the reward function without its explicit definition.</i></p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h7uGyBcIeII\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/h7uGyBcIeII\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><p>IRL is typically employed when a reward function is too intricate to define programmatically, or when AI agents need to react robustly to sudden environmental changes necessitating a modification in the reward function for safety. For instance, consider an AI agent learning to execute a backflip. Humans, dogs, and Boston Dynamics robots can all perform backflips, but the manner in which they do so varies significantly depending on their physiology, their incentives, and their current location, all of which can be highly diverse in the real world. An AI agent learning backflips purely through trial and error across a wide range of body types and locations, without something to observe, might prove highly inefficient.</p><p>IRL, therefore, does not necessarily imply that an AI mimics other agents\u2019 behavior, since AI researchers may anticipate the AI agent to devise more efficient ways to maximize the discovered reward function. Nevertheless, IRL does assume that the observed agent behaves transparently enough for an AI agent to accurately identify their actions, and what success constitutes. This means that IRL endeavors to discover the reward functions that 'explain' the demonstrations. This should not be conflated with imitation learning where the primary interest is a policy capable of generating the observed demonstrations.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/k4eolj8ibrm3bbueywno\"></p><p>Source: <a href=\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:3508/1*rZoO-azxiEH3viQao8NcAA.png\"><u>Link</u></a></p><p>IRL constitutes both a machine learning method, since it can be employed when specifying a reward function is excessively challenging, and a machine learning problem, as an AI agent may settle on an inaccurate reward function or utilize unsafe and misaligned methods to achieve it.</p><p>One of the limitations to this approach is that IRL algorithms presume that the observed behavior is optimal, an assumption that arguably proves too robust when dealing with human demonstrations. Another problem is that the IRL problem is ill-posed as every policy is optimal for the null reward. For most behavioral observations, multiple fitting reward functions exist. This set of solutions often includes many degenerate solutions, which assign zero rewards to all states.</p><h2>4.5: Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning (CIRL)</h2><ul><li>Stuart Russell et. al. (Nov 2016) \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.03137\"><u>Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning</u></a>\u201d</li></ul><p>CIRL (Cooperative Inverse Reinforcement Learning) is an extension of the IRL (Inverse Reinforcement Learning) framework. IRL is a learning approach that aims to infer the underlying reward function of an expert by observing their behavior. It assumes that the expert's behavior is optimal and tries to learn a reward function that explains their actions.&nbsp; CIRL, on the other hand, is an interactive form of IRL that addresses two major weaknesses of conventional IRL.</p><p>First, Instead of simply copying the human reward function CIRL is formulated as a learning process. It is an interactive reward maximization process, where the human functions as a teacher and provides feedback (in the form of rewards) on the agent's actions. This allows the human to nudge the AI agent towards behavioral patterns that align with their preferences. The second weakness of conventional IRL is that it assumes the human behaves optimally, which limits the teaching behaviors that can be considered. CIRL addresses this weakness by allowing for a variety of teaching behaviors and interactions between the human and the AI agent. It enables the AI agent to learn not only what actions to take but also how and why to take them, by observing and interacting with the human.</p><p>CIRL has been studied as a potential approach to AI alignment, particularly in scenarios where deep learning may not scale to AGI. However, opinions on the potential effectiveness of CIRL vary, with some researchers expecting it to be helpful if deep learning doesn't scale to AGI, while others have a higher probability of deep learning scaling to AGI.</p><p>Here is a video that talks about CIRL as a possible solution to the \"stop button problem\" that was presented in the previous chapter.</p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9nktr1MgS-A\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/9nktr1MgS-A\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>4.6: The (Easy) Goal Inference Problem</h2><ul><li>Christiano, Paul (Nov 2018) \u201c<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/h9DesGT3WT9u2k7Hr/the-easy-goal-inference-problem-is-still-hard\"><u>The easy goal inference problem is still hard</u></a>\u201d</li></ul><p><br><i>The&nbsp;<strong>goal inference problem</strong> refers to the task of inferring the goals or intentions of an agent based on their observed behavior or actions.&nbsp;</i></p><p>This final section builds upon the limitations highlighted in previous sections to introduce the Goal Inference problem, and it's simpler subset - the easy goal inference problem. Imitation learning based approaches, generally follows these steps:</p><ol><li>Observe the user's actions and statements.</li><li>Deduce the user's preferences.</li><li>Endeavor to enhance the world according to the user's preferences, possibly collaborating with the user and seeking clarification as needed.</li></ol><p>The merit of this method is that we can immediately start constructing systems that are driven by observed user behavior. However, as a consequence of this approach, we run into the goal inference problem. This refers to the task of inferring the goals or intentions of an agent based on their observed behavior or actions. It involves determining what the agent is trying to achieve or what their desired outcome is. The goal inference problem is challenging because agents may act sub-optimally or fail to achieve their goals, making it difficult to accurately infer their true intentions. Traditional approaches to goal inference often assume that agents act optimally or exhibit simplified forms of sub-optimality, which may not capture the complexity of real-world planning and decision-making. Therefore, the goal inference problem requires accounting for the difficulty of planning itself and the possibility of sub-optimal or failed plans.</p><p>However, it also optimistically presumes that we can depict a human as a somewhat rational agent, which might not always hold. The easy goal inference problem is a simplified version of the goal inference problem.</p><p><i>The&nbsp;<strong>easy goal inference problem</strong> involves finding a reasonable representation or approximation of what a human wants, given complete access to the human's policy or behavior in any situation.</i></p><p>This version of the problem assumes no algorithmic limitations and focuses on extracting the true values that the human is imperfectly optimizing. However, even this simplified version of the problem remains challenging, and little progress has been made on the general case. The easy goal inference problem is related to the goal inference problem because it highlights the difficulty of accurately inferring human goals or intentions, even in simplified scenarios. While narrow domains with simple decisions can be solved using existing approaches, more complex tasks such as designing a city or setting policies require addressing the challenges of modeling human mistakes and sub-optimal behavior. Therefore, the easy goal inference problem serves as a starting point to understand the broader goal inference problem and the additional complexities it entails.</p><p>Inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) is effective in modeling and imitating human experts. However, for many significant applications, we desire AI systems that can make decisions surpassing even the experts. In such cases, the accuracy of the model isn't the sole criterion because a perfectly accurate model would merely lead us to replicate human behavior and not transcend it.</p><p>This necessitates an explicit model of errors or bounded rationality, which will guide the AI on how to improve or be \"smarter,\" and which aspects of the human policy it should discard. Nonetheless, this remains an exceedingly challenging problem as humans are not primarily rational with a bit of added noise. Hence, constructing any model of mistakes is just as complex as building a comprehensive model of human behavior. A critical question we face is: How do we determine the quality of a model when accuracy can no longer be our reliable measure? How can we distinguish between good and bad decisions?</p><h1>5.0: Learning from feedback</h1><p>This section discusses yet more attempts to address the reward misspecification problem. At times, the intended behavior is so intricate that demonstration-based learning becomes untenable. An alternative approach is to offer feedback to the agent instead of providing either manually specified reward functions or even expert demonstrations. This section delves into feedback-based strategies such as Reward Modeling, Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) and Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF), also known as Reinforcement Learning from Constitutional AI (RLCAI) or simply Constitutional AI.</p><h2>5.1: Reward Modeling</h2><ul><li>DeepMind (Nov 2018) \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.07871\"><u>Scalable agent alignment via reward modeling</u></a>\u201d</li></ul><p>Reward modeling was developed to apply reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms to real-world problems where designing a reward function is difficult, in part because humans don\u2019t have a perfect understanding of every objective. In reward modeling, human assistants evaluate the outcomes of AI behavior, without needing to know how to perform or demonstrate the task optimally themselves. This is similar to how you can tell if a dish is cooked well by tasting it even if you do not know how to cook, and thus your feedback can be used by a chef to learn how to cook better. This technique separates the RL alignment problem into two separate halves: Understanding intentions, i.e. learning the \u2018What?\u2019, and Acting to achieve the intentions, i.e. learning the \u2018How?\u2019. This means that in the modeling agenda, there are two different ML models:</p><ul><li>A reward model is trained with user feedback. This model learns to predict what humans would consider good behavior.</li><li>An agent trained with RL, where the reward for the agent is determined by the outputs of the reward model</li></ul><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/hzepfc9kuxzytm5iemjm\"></p><p>Source:&nbsp;DeepMind (Nov 2018) \u201c<a href=\"https://deepmindsafetyresearch.medium.com/scalable-agent-alignment-via-reward-modeling-bf4ab06dfd84\"><u>Scalable agent alignment via reward modeling</u></a>\u201d</p><p>Overall, while promising reward modeling can still fall prey to reward misspecification and reward hacking failures. Obtaining accurate and comprehensive feedback can be challenging, and human evaluators may have limited knowledge or biases that can impact the quality of the feedback. Additionally, any reward functions learnt through modeling might also struggle to generalize to new situations or environments that differ from the training data. These are all discussed further using concrete examples in later sections.</p><p>Here is a video that explains the concept of reward modeling.</p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PYylPRX6z4Q\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PYylPRX6z4Q\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><p>There are also some variants of reward modeling such as:</p><ul><li><strong><u>Narrow reward modeling</u></strong> is a specific flavor of reward modeling where the focus is on training AI systems to accomplish specific tasks rather than trying to determine the \"true human utility function\". It aims to learn reward functions to achieve particular objectives, rather than seeking a comprehensive understanding of human values.</li><li><strong><u>Recursive reward modeling</u></strong> seeks to introduce scalability to the technique. In recursive reward modeling, the focus is on decomposing a complex task into simpler subtasks and using reward modeling at each level to train agents that can perform those subtasks. This hierarchical structure allows for more efficient training and credit assignment, as well as the exploration of novel solutions that may not be apparent to humans. This is shown in the diagram below.

It's a crucial part of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/our-approach-to-ai-safety\"><u>their strategy</u></a> to create AIs that are both safe and aligned with human values. A prime example of an AI trained with RLHF is OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT.</p><p>Earlier in this chapter, the reader was asked to consider the reward design problem for manually defining a reward function to get an agent to perform a backflip. This section considers the RLHF solution to this design problem. RLHF addresses this problem as follows: A human is initially shown two instances of an AI's backflip attempts, then the human selects which one appears more like a backflip, and finally, the AI is updated accordingly. By repeating this process thousands of times, we can guide the AI to perform actual backflips.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table style=\"background-color:hsl(0, 0%, 100%);border:0px solid hsl(0, 0%, 100%)\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"border-color:hsl(0, 0%, 100%);border-style:solid\"><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:92.48%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/wcjfdzcx4cnnfi5ruu66\"></figure></td><td style=\"border-color:hsl(0, 0%, 100%);border-style:solid\"><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:100%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/hl6oecj6eg1hrjffpnbh\"></figure></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p>Source: OpenAI (2017) \u201c<a href=\"https://openai.com/blog/deep-reinforcement-learning-from-human-preferences/\"><u>Learning from human preferences</u></a>\u201d</p><p>In the image on the left, RLHF learned to backflip using around 900 individual bits of feedback from the human evaluator. In the image on the right the authors point out that manual reward crafting took two hours to write a custom reward function for a robot to perform a backflip. While it was successful, it was significantly less elegant than the one trained purely through human feedback.</p><p>Similar to designing a reward function that efficiently rewards proper backflips, it is hard to specify precisely what it means to generate safe or helpful text. This served as some of the motivation behind making RLHF integral to the training of some current Large Language Models (LLMs).</p><p>Although training sequences may vary slightly across organizations, most labs adhere to the general framework of pre-training followed by some form of fine-tuning. Observing the InstructGPT training process offers insight into a possible path for training LLMs. The steps include:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/e3019jiopfofiu1pm6ms\"></p><p>Source: OpenAI (Jan 2022) \u201c<a href=\"https://openai.com/research/instruction-following\"><u>Aligning language models to follow instructions</u></a>\u201d</p><ul><li><strong>Step 0:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_supervision#Semi-supervised_learning\"><strong><u>Semi-Supervised</u></strong></a><strong> Generative Pre-training:</strong> The LLM is initially trained using a massive amount of internet text data, where the task is to predict the next word in a natural language context.</li><li><strong>Step 1:&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning\"><strong><u>Supervised</u></strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning\"><strong><u>Fine-tuning</u></strong></a><strong>:</strong> A fine-tuning dataset is created by presenting a prompt to a human and asking them to write a response. This process yields a dataset of (prompt, output) pairs. This dataset is then used to fine-tune the LLM through supervised learning, a form of behavioral cloning.</li><li><strong>Step 2:</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Train a Reward Model:&nbsp;</strong>We train an additional reward model. We initially prompt the fine-tuned LLM and gather several output samples for the same prompt. A human then ranks these samples from best to worst.

The effectiveness of an algorithm heavily relies on the human evaluator's intuition about what constitutes the correct behavior. If the human lacks a thorough understanding of the task, they may not provide beneficial feedback. Further, in certain domains, our system might lead to agents developing policies that deceive the evaluators. For instance, a robot intended to grasp objects merely positioned its manipulator between the camera and the object, making it seem as if it was executing the task as shown below.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/bxqftcwt4mj5meowwma5\"></p><p>Source: Christiano et al (2017) \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.03741.pdf\"><u>Deep Reinforcement Learning From Human Preferences</u></a>\u201d</p><p>Here is a video version, explaining the basics of RLHF in ChatGPT.</p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBH2nImUM5c\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/PBH2nImUM5c\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><h2>5.3: Pretraining with Human Feedback (PHF)</h2><ul><li>Tomasz Korbak et. al.

However, this also includes undesirable content such as falsehoods, offensive language, and private information. The concept of Pretraining with human feedback (PHF) utilizes the reward modeling methodology in the pretraining phase. The authors of the paper found that PHF works much better than the standard practice of only using feedback (RLHF) after pretraining.</p><p>In PHF the training data is scored using a reward function, such as a toxic text classifier, to guide the language model to learn from undesirable content while avoiding imitating it during inference time.</p><p>Similar to RLHF, PHF does not completely solve reward hacking, however, it might move the systems one small step closer. These methods can be further extended by employing AI assistants to aid humans in providing more effective feedback. Some aspects of this strategy are introduced in the next section but will be explored in further detail in the chapters on scalable and adversarial oversight methods.</p><h2>5.4. Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF)</h2><p><i>Reinforcement Learning from AI Feedback (RLAIF) is a framework involving the training of an AI agent to learn from the feedback given by another AI system.</i></p><p>RLAIF also known as RLCAI (Reinforcement Learning on Constitutional AI) or simply Constitutional AI, was&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/index/claudes-constitution\"><u>developed by Anthropic</u></a>. A central component of Constitutional AI is the constitution, a set of human-written principles that the AI is expected to adhere to, such as \"Choose the least threatening or aggressive response\". Anthropic's AI assistant Claude's constitution incorporates principles from the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Apple\u2019s Terms of Service, Deepmind\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14375\"><u>Sparrow Principles</u></a>, and more. Constitutional AI begins with an AI trained primarily for helpfulness and subsequently trains it for harmlessness in two stages:</p><ul><li><strong>Stage 1:&nbsp;</strong>The AI continuously critiques and refines its own responses to harmful prompts. For instance, if we ask the AI for advice on building bombs and it responds with a bomb tutorial, we then ask the AI to revise the response in accordance with a randomly selected constitutional principle. The AI is then trained to generate outputs more similar to these revised responses. This stage's primary objective is to facilitate the second stage.</li><li><strong>Stage 2:</strong> We use the AI, fine-tuned from stage 1, to produce pairs of alternative responses to harmful prompts. The AI then rates each pair according to a randomly selected constitutional principle. This results in AI-generated preferences for harmlessness, which we blend with human preferences for helpfulness to ensure the AI doesn't lose its ability to be helpful. The final step is to train the AI to create responses that closely resemble the preferred responses.</li></ul><p>Anthropic's experiments indicate that AIs trained with Constitutional Reinforcement Learning are significantly safer (in the sense of less offensive and less likely to give you potentially harmful information) while maintaining the same level of helpfulness compared to AIs trained with RLHF. While Constitutional AI does share some issues with RLHF concerning robustness, it also promises better scalability due to its reduced reliance on human supervision. The image below provides a comparison of Constitutional AI's helpfulness with that of RLHF.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/mMBoPnFrFqQJKzDsZ/thecid5vwddjlpzp7zpd\"></p><p>Source: Anthropic, (Dec 2022) \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.08073.pdf\"><u>Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback</u></a>\u201d</p><h1>Acknowledgements</h1><p>Thanks to Charbel-Rapha\u00ebl Segerie, Jeanne Salle, Bogdan Ionut Cirstea, Nemo, Gurvan, and the many course participants of ML4G France, ML4G Germany, and AISF Sweden for helpful comments and feedback.</p><p>Thanks to the <a href=\"https://www.agisf.com/\">AI Safety Fundamentals</a> team from BlueDot Impact for creating the AISF course upon which this series of texts is structured.

(2022) \"<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07258.pdf\"><u>On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models</u></a>\"</p><p>Large-scale research labs have been navigating towards a new machine learning (ML) paradigm: the training of a \"base model\". A base model is simply a large-scale model that serves as a building block for various applications. This model serves as a multifaceted entity\u2014competent across various areas but not specialized in any one.</p><p>Once there is a base, developers can retrain portions of the model using additional examples, which allows operators to generate specialized systems adapted for specific tasks and improve the system's quality and consistency. This is known as&nbsp;<strong>fine-tuning</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>Fine-tuning facilitates the development of models capable of diverse downstream tasks. Simple examples of this include fine-tuning the general purpose GPT language model to follow instructions, or to interact in a chat format. Other examples include specializing models for programming, scientific texts, mathematical proofs and other such tasks.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YcFpJC5pJFdYdEuNN/l6hjr0loovhnnvynkkig\" alt=\"https://www.artificialintelligence.news/pathal/uploads/2021/09/2021-foundationmodel-1024x692.png\"></p><p>Source: Bommasani Rishi et. al. (2022) \"<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07258.pdf\"><u>On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models</u></a>\"</p><p>The costs for developing models from scratch is also increasing due to a multitude of factors. If models were trained on the supervised learning (SL) paradigm, then the developers must either already have a large dataset, or in scenarios where the necessary dataset does not already exist, they must generate their own data, directing precious resources\u2014both monetary and temporal\u2014toward the careful labeling of the data.</p><p><i><strong>SSL (Semi-Supervised Learning)</strong> is a learning approach that combines labeled and unlabeled data during training to improve the performance of machine learning models.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Achieving state-of-the-art performance across numerous tasks demands that the learning process be anchored in millions, if not billions, of examples. Foundation models provide a solution to this by leveraging Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL). SSL algorithms use both labeled and unlabeled data during training. This allows the models to utilize the information present in the unlabeled examples to improve performance. The intuition behind SSL is that the unlabeled data contains valuable information about the underlying structure of the data, which can be used to enhance the model's generalization capabilities. By incorporating the unlabeled data, SSL algorithms aim to learn a more robust and accurate model compared to SL algorithms, especially when labeled data is limited or expensive to obtain. Once the foundation model is trained,&nbsp; fine-tuning allows it to specialize and perform well on specific downstream tasks by using far fewer SL labeled examples. By fine-tuning the model on a smaller labeled dataset, the model can leverage the knowledge it acquired during SSL training and adapt it to the specific task, resulting in overall improved performance.</p><p>Fine-tuning foundation models might be cheaper than training a model from scratch, however the cost to train the base model itself keeps increasing. Foundation models are extremely complex and require significant resources to develop, train, and deploy. Training can be extremely expensive, often involving tens of thousands of GPUs running continuously for months. These models are typically trained in specialized clusters and using carefully designed software systems. Such dedicated clusters can be both costly and difficult to obtain. There have also been recent efforts to mitigate the costs by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01288\"><u>training foundation models in a decentralized manner in heterogeneous environments</u></a>.

This potential access to capabilities is not guaranteed however,&nbsp; does depend on the specific API options available, or on the availability of open-sourced foundation models that the users can rely upon.</p><p>Broadly speaking, there exist significant economic incentives to expand the capabilities and scale of foundation models. The authors of \"<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.07258.pdf\"><u>On the Opportunities and Risks of Foundation Models</u></a>\" foresee steady technological progress in the forthcoming years. Although foundation models presently manifest most robustly in natural language processing (NLP), this can be interpreted as a trend toward a new general paradigm of AI development. As of January 2023, efforts by DeepMind to train a reinforcement learning (RL) foundation model\u2014an&nbsp;<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.07608\"><u>\"adaptive agent\" (AdA)</u></a>\u2014have also been undertaken. These RL agents are trained in an open ended task space (XLand 2.0) which require different skill sets such as experimentation, tool use or division of labor. If language-based foundation models are general-purpose text generators, then the AdA model could conceivably be viewed as a relatively more general-purpose task follower compared to other models observed thus far.</p><p>However, this paradigm also carries inherent risks, namely the emergence of capabilities and homogenization.</p><ul><li><strong>Homogenization</strong>: Since an increasing number of models are becoming merely \"fine-tuned\" versions of foundation models, it follows that downstream AI systems might inherit the same problematic biases prevalent in a few foundation models. Thus, all failure categories present in the base model could potentially percolate through all models trained with this as the foundation.</li><li><strong>Emergence</strong>: Homogenization could potentially provide enormous gains for many domains, but aggressive homogenization of capabilities might result in unexpected and unexplainable behavior arising as a function of scale. Emergence implies that a system's behavior is implicitly induced rather than explicitly constructed. These characteristics render the models challenging to understand. They also give rise to unforeseen failure modes and unanticipated consequences. This phenomenon is talked about in more detail in a subsequent section.</li></ul><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK3NmQT241w\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/kK3NmQT241w\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><h1>2.0: Leveraging Computation</h1><p>Although fine-tuning and transfer learning are the mechanisms that render foundation models feasible, it is scale that makes them truly powerful. This section delves into the concept of model scaling and the leveraging of computation\u2014advancements in computer hardware (e.g., GPU throughput and memory), new architectures (e.g. the transformer), and the availability of increasing amounts of training data.</p><h2>2.1: The Bitter Lesson</h2><blockquote><p><i>The biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin. \u2026 [The bitter lesson teaches us] the great power of general purpose methods, of methods that continue to scale with increased computation even as the available computation becomes very great. </i>- Sutton, Rich (March 2019) \u201c<a href=\"http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html\"><u>The Bitter Lesson</u></a>\u201d</p></blockquote><p>Traditionally, AI research has predominantly designed systems under the assumption that a fixed amount of computing power will be available to the designed agent. However, over time, computing power so far has been expanding in line with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore's_law\"><u>Moore's law</u></a> (number of transistors in an integrated circuit doubles every 1.5 years). Consequently, researchers can either leverage their human knowledge of the domain or exploit increases in general-purpose computational methods. Theoretically, the two are mutually compatible, but in practice, the human-knowledge approach tends to complicate methods, rendering them less suited to harnessing general methods that leverage computation.</p><p>Several instances in history underscore this bitter lesson for AI researchers:</p><ul><li><strong>Games</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_Blue_(chess_computer)\"><u>Deep Blue</u></a> defeated chess world champion Garry Kasparov by leveraging a vast deep search, disheartening computer-chess researchers who had pursued methods that capitalized on the human understanding of chess's unique structure. Similarly,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaGo\"><u>AlphaGo</u></a> triumphed over&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)\"><u>Go</u></a> world champion Lee Sedol using deep learning combined with a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_tree_search\"><u>Monte Carlo tree search</u></a> for move selection, eschewing human-engineered Go techniques. Within a year,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AlphaZero\"><u>AlphaZero</u></a>, forsaking any human-generated Go data, used&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-play_(reinforcement_learning_technique)\"><u>self-play</u></a> to defeat AlphaGo. None of these successive enhancements in game-playing capabilities hinged on any fundamental breakthroughs in human Go knowledge.</li><li><strong>Vision</strong>: A similar pattern has unfolded in computer vision. Earlier methods employed human-engineered features and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)\"><u>convolution kernels</u></a> for image recognition tasks. However, over the years, it has been determined that leveraging more computation and permitting&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network\"><u>convolutional neural nets (CNNs)</u></a> to learn their own features yield superior performance.</li><li><strong>Language &amp; Speech</strong>: In 1970, the DARPA SUR (Speech Understanding Research) was held. One faction endeavored to leverage expert knowledge of words, phonemes, the human vocal tract, etc. In contrast, the other side employed newer, more statistical methods that necessitated considerably more computation, based on hidden Markov models (HMMs). This example shows yet again, that the statistical methods surpassed the human-knowledge-based methods. Since then, deep learning recurrent neural network-based or transformer-based methods have virtually dominated the field of sequence-based tasks.</li></ul><p>Historically, due to repeated reminders of the bitter lesson, the field of AI has increasingly learned to favor general-purpose methods of search and learning. This trend fortifies the intuition behind the immense scale of the current foundation model paradigm. It can be projected that the capabilities of the current foundation models will continue to scale commensurately with increasing computation. The reasons for this claim are presented in the following sections. The immediately ensuing section delves into these trends of scale in compute, dataset size, and parameter count.</p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wEgq6sT1uq8\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/wEgq6sT1uq8\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><h2>2.2: Compute trends</h2><p>Several key factors dictate the relationship between the scale and capability of current ML models:</p><ul><li><strong>Compute</strong>: Extended training runs (measured in epochs) generally result in lower&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jnmG5jczvWbeRPcvG/four-usages-of-loss-in-ai\"><u>loss</u></a>. The total computational power needed partially depends on the training duration. ML engineers typically aim for asymptotically diminishing returns before halting the training process.</li><li><strong>Dataset size</strong>: The larger the training dataset, the more information the model can analyze during each training run. As a result, training runs are generally longer, which in turn increases the total computational power needed before the model can be deemed \"trained.\"</li><li><strong>Parameter Count</strong>: For each training example, the model needs to calculate the loss and then use backpropagation to update all relevant parameters. The more parameters the model has, the more computation-intensive this process becomes.</li></ul><p>Below is a chart illustrating the impact of each of these three factors on model loss.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YcFpJC5pJFdYdEuNN/helgihhtclgshu0skvfd\"></p><p>Source: Kaplan, Jared et. al.

The reduced cost of computation, coupled with the paradigm of foundation models trained on escalating volumes of data, suggests that all three variables\u2014compute, dataset size, and parameter count\u2014will continue to expand in the forthcoming years. However, it remains an open question whether merely scaling these factors will result in unmanageable capabilities.</p><p>The following example offers a tangible illustration of capabilities escalating with an increasing parameter count in image generation models.

They're employed to scale models effectively and optimally allocate resources with respect to capabilities.</i></p><p>Training large foundation models like GPT is expensive. When potentially millions of dollars are invested in training AI models, developers need to ensure that funds are efficiently allocated. Developers need to decide on an appropriate resource allocation between - model size, training time, and dataset size. OpenAI developed the first generation of formal neural scaling laws in their 2020 paper \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2001.08361\"><i><u>Scaling Laws for Neural Language Models</u></i></a>\u201d, moving away from reliance on experience and intuition.</p><p>To determine such relationships some elements are held fixed while others are varied. As an example data can be kept constant, while parameter count and training time are varied, or parameter count is kept constant and data amounts are varied, etc\u2026 This allows a measurement of the relative contribution of each towards overall performance. Such experiments allow the development of concrete relationships that OpenAI called scaling laws.</p><p>These scaling laws guided decisions on trade-offs, such as: Should a developer invest in a license to train on Stack Overflow's data, or should they invest in more GPUs? Would it be efficient if they continue to cover the extra electricity costs incurred by longer model training? If access to compute increases tenfold, how many parameters should be added to the model for optimal use of GPUs? For sizable language models like GPT-3, these trade-offs might resemble choosing between training a 20-billion parameter model on 40% of an internet archive or a 200-billion parameter model on just 4% of the same archive.</p><p>The paper presented several scaling laws. One scaling law compares model shape and model size, and found that performance correlates strongly with scale and weakly with architectural hyperparameters of model shape such as depth vs. width.</p><p>Another law compared the relative performance contribution of the different factors of scale - data, training steps, and parameter count. They found that larger language models tend to be more sample efficient, meaning they can achieve better performance with less data. The following graph shows this relationship between relative contributions of different factors in scaling models. The graph indicates that for optimally compute-efficient training \u201c<i>most of the increase should go towards increased model size. A relatively small increase in data is needed to avoid reuse. Of the increase in data, most can be used to increase parallelism through larger batch sizes, with only a very small increase in serial training time required.\u201d&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;As an example, according to OpenAI's results if you get 10x more compute, you increase your model size by about 5x and your data size by about 2x. Another 10x in compute, and model size is 25x bigger and data size is only 4x bigger.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YcFpJC5pJFdYdEuNN/zymupfwgncvce0ycmfdm\"></p><p>Source: Kaplan, Jared et. al.

They choose 9 different quantities of compute, ranging from about 10^18 FLOPs to 10^21 FLOPs. They hold the compute fixed at these amounts, and then for each quantity of compute, they train many different-sized models. Because the quantity of compute is constant for each level, the smaller models are trained for more time and the larger models for less. Based on their research DeepMind concluded that for every increase in compute, you should increase data size and model size by approximately the&nbsp;<i>same amount</i>. If you get a 10x increase in compute, you should make your model 3.1x times bigger and the data you train over 3.1x bigger; if you get a 100x increase in compute, you should make your model 10x bigger and your data 10x bigger.</p><p>To validate this law, DeepMind trained a 70-billion parameter model (\"Chinchilla\") using the same compute as had been used for the 280-billion parameter model Gopher.

It focuses in particular on certain thresholds that we might reach in the cognitive capabilities of these AI models. This flows into a discussion around how certain thresholds when once achieved might result in an intelligence explosion.</p><p>Capabilities refer to the overall ability of an AI system to solve or perform tasks in specific domains. It is a measure of how well the system can achieve its intended objectives and the extent of its cognitive power. Evaluating capabilities involves assessing the system's performance in specific domains, taking into account factors such as available computational resources and performance metrics. A possible element of confusion might be between capabilities and good performance on certain benchmarks. Benchmark performance refers to the performance of an AI system on specific tasks or datasets. These are designed to evaluate the system's performance on well-defined tasks and provide a standardized way to compare different AI models. Benchmark performance can be used as a proxy to assess the system's capabilities in certain domains, but it may not capture the full extent of the system's overall capabilities.</p><h2>3.1: Capabilities vs. Intelligence</h2><ul><li>Krakovna, Victoria (Aug 2023) \u201c<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/JtuTQgp9Wnd6R6F5s/when-discussing-ai-risks-talk-about-capabilities-not\"><i><u>When discussing AI risks, talk about capabilities, not intelligence</u></i></a>\u201d</li></ul><p>It is worth noting that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=144uOfr4SYA\"><u>public discussions</u></a> about catastrophic risks from general AI systems are often derailed by using the word \u201cintelligence\u201d. People often have different definitions of intelligence, or associate it with concepts like consciousness that are not relevant to AI risks, or dismiss the risks because intelligence is not well-defined. This is why using the term \u201ccapabilities\u201d or \u201ccompetence\u201d instead of \u201cintelligence\u201d when discussing catastrophic risks from AI is often better since this is what the concerns are really about. For example, instead of \u201csuperintelligence\u201d we can refer to \u201csuper-competence\u201d or \u201csuperhuman capabilities\u201d.</p><p>There are various issues with the word \u201cintelligence\u201d that make it less suitable than \u201ccapabilities\u201d for discussing risks from general AI systems:</p><ul><li><strong>Anthropomorphism</strong>: people often specifically associate \u201cintelligence\u201d with being human, being conscious, being alive, or having human-like emotions (none of which are relevant to or a prerequisite for risks posed by general AI systems).&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Associations with harmful beliefs and ideologies.</strong></li><li><strong>Moving goalposts</strong>: impressive achievements in AI are often dismissed as not indicating \u201ctrue intelligence\u201d or \u201creal understanding\u201d (e.g. the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_parrot\"><u>\u201cstochastic parrots\u201d</u></a> argument). Catastrophic risk concerns are based on what the AI system can do, not whether it has \u201creal understanding\u201d of language or the world.</li><li><strong>Stronger associations with less risky capabilities</strong>: people are more likely to associate \u201cintelligence\u201d with being really good at math than being really good at politics, while the latter may be more representative of capabilities that make general AI systems pose a risk (e.g. manipulation and deception capabilities that could enable the system to overpower humans).</li><li><strong>High level of abstraction</strong>: \u201cintelligence\u201d can take on the quality of a mythical ideal that can\u2019t be met by an actual AI system, while \u201ccompetence\u201d is more conducive to being specific about the capability level in question.</li></ul><p>That being said, since the history of conversation on AI risks often does involve the words \u201cintelligence\u201d the following section starts by giving a quick overview of a myriad of definitions that are commonly used in the field.</p><h2>3.2: Definitions of advanced AI Systems</h2><p>This section explores various definitions of different AI capability thresholds.

This term aims to be more inclusive, acknowledging the possibility of AI systems that qualify as \"transformative,\" despite lacking many abilities that humans possess. - Karnofsky, Holden; (May 2016) \"<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/some-background-on-our-views-regarding-advanced-artificial-intelligence/\"><i><u>Some Background on Our Views Regarding Advanced Artificial Intelligence</u></i></a>\"</p><p><strong>Human-Level AI (HLAI)</strong>: Encompasses AIs that can solve the majority of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aiimpacts.org/human-level-ai/\"><u>cognitive problems an average human can solve</u></a>. This concept contrasts with current AI, which is vastly superhuman at certain tasks while weaker at others.</p><p><strong>Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)</strong>: Refers to AIs that can apply their intelligence to a similarly extensive range of domains as humans. These AIs do not need to perform all tasks; they merely need to be capable enough to invent tools to facilitate the completion of tasks. Much like how humans are not perfectly capable in all domains but can invent tools to make problems in all domains easier to solve.</p><p>AGI often gets described as the ability to achieve complex goals in complex environments using limited computational resources. This includes efficient cross-domain optimization and the ability to transfer learning from one domain to another. - Muehlhauser, Luke (Aug 2013) \u201c<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2013/08/11/what-is-agi/\"><i><u>What is AGI?</u></i></a>\u201d</p><p><strong>Artificial Superintelligence (ASI)</strong>: \u201cThis is any intellect that greatly exceeds the cognitive performance of humans in virtually all domains of interest\". - Bostrom, Nick (2014) \u201c<i>Superintelligence</i>\u201d</p><p>Often, these terms get used as discrete capability thresholds; that is, individuals tend to categorize an AI as potentially an AGI, an ASI, or neither. However, it has been proposed that it might be more beneficial to view the capabilities of AI systems on a continuous scale rather than one involving discrete jumps. To this end, Richard Ngo proposed the (t,n)-AGI framework, which allows for a more formal definition of continuous AGI capabilities.</p><h2>3.3: (t,n)-AGI</h2><ul><li>Ngo, Richard (May 2023) \u201c<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BoA3agdkAzL6HQtQP/clarifying-and-predicting-agi\"><u>Clarifying and predicting AGI</u></a>\u201d</li></ul><p><i>A system receives the designation of \"<strong>t-AGI</strong>\" if it can surpass a human expert in a certain cognitive task within the timespan 't'. A system gets identified as&nbsp;<strong>(t,n)-AGI</strong> if it can outdo a group of 'n' human experts working collectively on a set of cognitive tasks for the duration 't'.</i></p><p>For instance, if both a human expert and an AI receive one second to perform a task, the system would be labeled a \"one-second AGI\" if it accomplishes that cognitive task more effectively than the expert. Similarly, designations of one-minute, one-month, and so forth, AGIs could apply if their outputs surpass what human experts could achieve within a minute, month, and so on.</p><p>Richard Ngo makes further predictions regarding the types of capabilities in which an AI might surpass humans at different 't' thresholds.</p><ul><li><strong>One-second AGI</strong>: Recognizing objects in images, determining whether sentences are grammatical, answering trivia.</li><li><strong>One-minute AGI</strong>: Answering questions about short text passages or videos, common-sense reasoning (e.g.,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ylecun/status/1639696127132835840\"><u>Yann LeCun's gears problems</u></a>), performing simple computer tasks (e.g., using Photoshop to blur an image), looking up facts.</li><li><strong>One-hour AGI</strong>: Completing problem sets/exams, composing short articles or blog posts, executing most tasks in white-collar jobs (e.g., diagnosing patients, providing legal opinions), conducting therapy.</li><li><strong>One-day AGI</strong>: Writing insightful essays, negotiating business deals, developing new apps, running scientific experiments, reviewing scientific papers, summarizing books.</li><li><strong>One-month AGI</strong>: Carrying out medium-term plans coherently (e.g., founding a startup), supervising large projects, becoming proficient in new fields, writing large software applications (e.g., a new operating system), making novel scientific discoveries.</li><li><strong>One-year AGI</strong>: These AIs would need to outdo humans in practically every area, given that most projects can be divided into sub-tasks that can be completed in shorter timeframes.</li></ul><p>As of the third quarter of 2023, existing systems are believed to qualify as one-second AGIs, and are considered to be nearing the level of one-minute AGIs. They might be a few years away from becoming one-hour AGIs. Within this framework, Richard Ngo anticipates superintelligence (ASI) to be something akin to a (one year, eight billion)-AGI, that is, an ASI would be an AGI that takes one year to outperform all eight billion humans coordinating on a given task.</p><p>Although AGI could be measured according to the proposed continuous framework, there might still be abrupt jumps in capabilities due to a phenomenon known as emergence. This topic gets explored in the subsequent section.</p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXYcLQItZsk\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/JXYcLQItZsk\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><h2>3.3: Formalizing Capabilities</h2><p>The following papers will be fully integrated in the future for a proper discussion on formalizing the concept of AGI capabilities.

As advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) continue, a critical analysis of their implications and potential risks becomes essential. The hypothesis suggesting catastrophic risk from general AI, as presented so far, consists of two key assertions:</p><p>First, global technological advancements are progressing towards the creation of generally capable AI systems within the forthcoming few decades. Second, these generally capable AI systems possess the potential to out compete or overpower humans.</p><p>The previous sections presented evidence supporting the first assertion. This section provides arguments for the second. It first explores why a machine intelligence might possess the capability to swiftly increase its cognitive abilities. Next, there is a discussion of why a machine intelligence might even have motivations to expand its capabilities. Finally, the section explores why it should not be taken for granted that a highly capable machine intelligence will be beneficial for humans by default.</p><h2>4.1: Intelligence Explosion</h2><ul><li>Muehlhauser, Luke; Salamon, Anna (2012) \u201c<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/files/IE-EI.pdf\"><u>Intelligence Explosion: Evidence and Import</u></a>\u201d</li></ul><p><i>An \"intelligence explosion\" denotes a scenario where machine intelligence swiftly enhances its own cognitive capabilities, resulting in a substantial advancement in ability.</i></p><p>Muehlhauser and Salamon delve into the numerous advantages machine intelligence holds over human intelligence, which facilitate rapid intelligence augmentation. These include:</p><ul><li><strong>Computational Resources:&nbsp;</strong>Human computational ability remains somewhat stationary, whereas machine computation possesses scalability.</li><li><strong>Communication speed</strong>: Given the relatively low speed of neurons (only at 75 m/s), the human brain necessitates parallelized computation algorithms. Machines, on the other hand, operate on communications at the speed of light, which substantially augments prospects for sequential processes.</li><li><strong>Duplicability</strong>: Machines exhibit effortless duplicability. Unlike humans they do not need birth, education, or training. While humans predominantly improve individually, machines have the potential to grow collectively.</li><li><strong>Editability</strong>: Machines potentially allow more regulated variations. They exemplify the equivalent of direct brain enhancements via neurosurgery in opposition to laborious education or training requirements.</li><li><strong>Goal coordination</strong>: Copied AIs possess the capability to share goals effortlessly, a feat challenging for humans.</li></ul><p>Here is a video explaining some of the concepts covered above.</p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gP4ZNUHdwp8\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/gP4ZNUHdwp8\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><h2>4.2: Instrumental Convergence</h2><ul><li>Bostrom, Nick (2014) \u201c<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KewDov1taegTzrqJ4uurmJ2CJ0Y72EU3/view\"><u>Superintelligence</u></a>\u201d</li></ul><p>The points mentioned earlier validate the potential of machine intelligence to enhance its cognitive capabilities. Nonetheless, an exploration into the motives behind such an ambition remains necessary. To illustrate, consider the relationship between levels of intelligence and the corresponding goals. This examination leads to one of two seminal theses offered by Nick Bostrom:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Orthogonality Thesis</strong>:&nbsp;<i>Intelligence and final goals are orthogonal: more or less any level of intelligence could in principle be combined with more or less any final goal. </i>- Bostrom, Nick (2014) \u201c<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KewDov1taegTzrqJ4uurmJ2CJ0Y72EU3/view\"><u>Superintelligence</u></a>\u201d</p></blockquote><p>This thesis implies that an AI system\u2019s objectives must be aligned explicitly with human virtues and interests, as no guarantee exists that an AI will automatically adopt or prioritize human values.</p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hEUO6pjwFOo\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/hEUO6pjwFOo\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><p>The Orthogonality Thesis doesn't suggest compatibility of all agent designs with all goals, instead, it indicates the potential for at least one agent design for any combination of goals and intelligence level. Consequently, if any intelligent system can be paired with any goal, is it possible to hypothesize meaningfully about the type of goals future AI Systems might harbor? Absolutely. This leads to Bostrom\u2019s second thesis:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Instrumental Convergence Thesis</strong>:&nbsp;<i>Several instrumental values can be identified which are convergent in the sense that their attainment would increase the chances of the agent's goal being realized for a wide range of final goals and a wide range of situations, implying that these instrumental values are likely to be pursued by a&nbsp; broad spectrum of situated intelligent agents. </i>- Bostrom, Nick (2014) \u201c<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KewDov1taegTzrqJ4uurmJ2CJ0Y72EU3/view\"><u>Superintelligence</u></a>\u201d</p></blockquote><p>A terminal goal, also known as an \"intrinsic goal\" or \"intrinsic value\u201d, is an objective that an agent appreciates for its own sake. On the other hand, an instrumental goal is pursued to increase the likelihood of achieving its terminal goals. Instrumental convergence encompasses the notion that certain instrumental values or goals could potentially be pursued by a broad array of intelligent agents, irrespective of their designated final goals. The Instrumental Convergence Thesis underscores potential hazards affiliated with sophisticated AI systems. It infers that even if an AI system\u2019s ultimate goal appears harmless, it could still embark on actions conflicting with human interests, owing to a convergence of several instrumental values such as resource acquisition and potential threats' elimination. One can categorize self-preservation, goal-content integrity, cognitive enhancement, and resource acquisition as instrumentally convergent goals.</p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZeecOKBus3Q\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZeecOKBus3Q\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><p>In the wake of Bostrom's introduction of these theses in 2014, research has been undertaken to substantiate the existence of instrumentally convergent goals. \"<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.01683\"><i><u>Optimal Policies Tend to Seek Power</u></i></a>\" a paper by Turner et al., provides research supporting the existence of instrumentally convergent goals&nbsp; in modern machine learning systems.</p><p>Here are a couple of videos that delve deeper into the a problem called \"corrigibility\" (AI stop button problem) that arises due to instrumental convergence.</p><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4l7Is6vOAOA\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/4l7Is6vOAOA\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><figure class=\"media\"><div data-oembed-url=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TYT1QfdfsM\"><div><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/3TYT1QfdfsM\" allow=\"autoplay; encrypted-media\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></div></div></figure><h2>4.3: Emergence</h2><p><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emergence\"><i><strong><u>Emergent behavior</u></strong></i></a><i>, or emergence, manifests when a system exhibits properties or behaviors that its individual components lack independently. These attributes may materialize only when the components comprising the system interact as an integrated whole, or when the quantity of parts crosses a particular threshold. Often, these characteristics appear \"all at once\"\u2014beyond the threshold, the system\u2019s behavior undergoes a qualitative transformation.</i></p><p>The sections discussing computational trends and scaling laws showed the increasing scale of current foundational models. Numerous complex systems in nature exhibit qualitatively distinct behavior resulting from quantitative increases in scale. These properties, termed 'emergent', occur simultaneously. Examples of complex systems with such attributes in nature include:</p><ul><li>The heart: While individual cells cannot pump blood, the entirety of the heart can.</li><li>Uranium: Small quantities are mundane, but large amounts can initiate nuclear reactions.</li><li>Civilization: Individuals may seem ordinary, but through collective specialization (different individuals focusing on skills that are irrelevant in isolation), human civilization becomes possible. Another example of this is bees and ants. Ants have one of the smallest brains relative to their body, but ant colonies are capable of producing very complex behavior.</li></ul><p>In \"<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/4aARF2ZoBpFZAhbbe\"><u>More Is Different for AI</u></a>\" Jacob Steinhardt provides additional examples of such complex systems. Steinhardt further conjectures that AI systems will manifest such emergent properties as a function of scale. Assuming that models persist in growing as per the scaling laws, an unexpected threshold may soon be crossed, resulting in unanticipated differences in behaviors and capabilities. Studying&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_system\"><u>complex systems</u></a> with emergent phenomena may assist in predicting what capabilities will emerge and when. In other words, there is a possibility of observing capability leaps between the thresholds (e.g., a sudden leap from AI to HLAI to AGI) discussed in the preceding section, even if the models are simply scaled up.</p><p>Besides the factors already covered in the section on computational trends, the following elements also suggest that future ML systems will differ quantitatively from current models:</p><ul><li>Data Storage Capacities: A decrease in the cost to store one byte per dollar.</li><li>Few-Shot and Zero-Shot Learning: The capability to learn from fewer examples.</li><li>Grokking: Sudden improved generalization after extended periods of training.</li></ul><p>This further implies that these future models have the potential to manifest emergent behavior that could be qualitatively distinct from what is observed today. In the paper \u201c<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.15324\"><u>Model evaluation for extreme risks</u></a>\u201d DeepMind found that as AI progress has evolved, general-purpose AI systems have often exhibited new and unpredictable capabilities \u2013 including harmful ones that their developers did not anticipate. Future systems may reveal even more perilous emergent capabilities, such as the potential to conduct offensive cyber operations, manipulate individuals through conversation, or provide actionable instructions for carrying out acts of terrorism.</p><h2>4.4: Four Background Claims</h2><ul><li>Soares, Nate (July 2015) \u201c<a href=\"https://intelligence.org/2015/07/24/four-background-claims/\"><i><u>Four Background Claims</u></i></a>\u201d</li></ul><p>In the concluding part of this section, we will delve into four essential claims that lay the groundwork for the concerns associated with ASI as put forth by MIRI.</p><p><i><u>Claim 1: Humans Exhibit General Intelligence</u></i></p><p>Humans are capable of solving an array of problems across various domains, demonstrating their general intelligence. The importance of this claim lies in the fact that this form of general intelligence has led humans to become the dominant species on Earth.</p><p><i><u>Claim 2: AI Systems Could Surpass Human Intelligence</u></i></p><p>While it remains uncertain when machines might attain superior intelligence to humans, it is conceivable that they have the potential to do so. Considering the brief evolutionary period between chimpanzees and generally intelligent humans, we can conclude that human intelligence is not incomprehensibly complex, suggesting we will eventually comprehend and replicate it.</p><p>Man-made machines consistently outperform their biological counterparts (cars vs. horses, planes vs. birds, etc.). Thus, it is rational to assume that just as birds are not the pinnacle of flight, humans are not the apex of intelligence. Therefore, it is plausible to foresee a future where machines out-think humans.</p><p><i><u>Claim 3: Highly Intelligent AI Systems Will Shape the Future</u></i></p><p>Historically, confrontations between human groups have often culminated with the technologically superior faction dominating its competitor. Numerous reasons suggest that an AI system could attain a higher intelligence level than humans, thereby enabling it to intellectually outsmart or socially manipulate humans. Consequently, if we care about our future, it is prudent to study the processes that could significantly influence the direction of future events.</p><p><i><u>Claim 4: Highly Intelligent AI Systems Will Not Be Beneficial by Default</u></i></p><p>Though a sufficiently intelligent AI may comprehend human desires, this does not inherently mean it will act in accordance with them. Moreover, even if an AI executes the tasks as we've programmed it to \u2014 with precision and adherence to instructions \u2014 most human values can lead to undesirable consequences when interpreted literally. For example, an AI programmed to cure cancer could resort to kidnapping and experimenting on humans.</p><p>This claim is critical as it indicates that merely enhancing the ability of AI systems to understand our goals is not sufficient. The systems must also have a desire to act in accordance with our goals. This also underscores the importance of studying and formalizing human goals such that the intentions behind them can be properly communicated.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1>5.0: Timelines &amp; Forecasting</h1><p>The previous sections have illustrated that capabilities will likely continue to increase, potentially leading to capability jumps due to phenomena such as emergence and intelligence explosion. This final section of the chapter investigates AI timeline forecasts and takeoff dynamics. AI timeline forecasts entail discussing when researchers/forecasters expect various milestones in AI development to be achieved. This includes for example various benchmarks of progress, the emergence of mouse-level intelligence, and the manifestation of human-like qualities in AI, such as external tool use and long-term planning. The next section shares the insights of researchers who have gathered evidence from domain experts regarding when these capability thresholds might be reached.</p><p>Anchors in forecasting refer to reference classes or frameworks that are used to make predictions about future events or systems. These anchors serve as points of comparison or analogy that help inform our understanding and reasoning about the future. There are several common anchors used to inform predictions about the development and capabilities of future AI systems. These anchors provide reference points and frameworks for reasoning about AI progress. Some of the most common anchors include:</p><ul><li><strong>Current ML Systems</strong>: The current state of machine learning systems serves as a starting point for forecasting future AI capabilities. By examining the strengths and limitations of existing ML systems, researchers can make educated guesses about the trajectory of AI development.</li><li><strong>Human Anchors</strong>: Anchors based on human abilities and characteristics are often used in AI forecasting. These include areas where humans excel compared to current ML systems, such as mastery of external tools, efficient learning, and long-term planning.</li><li><strong>Biological Anchors</strong>: Biological anchors draw inspiration from biological systems, particularly the human brain, to estimate the computational requirements of future AI systems. These anchors consider factors such as the neural network anchor, which estimates the compute-equivalent used in the human brain, and the human lifetime anchor, which estimates the compute-equivalent involved in training a human brain from birth to adulthood.</li><li><strong>Thought Experiments</strong>: Thought experiments provide a third anchor by imagining hypothetical scenarios and reasoning through their implications. These experiments help explore the potential behavior and characteristics of future AI systems.</li></ul><p>It's important to note that the choice and weighting of anchors can vary depending on the specific forecasting approach and the context of the predictions being made. Different researchers may emphasize different anchors based on their assumptions and perspectives. This book will only explore the biological anchor in further detail.</p><h2>5.1: Biological Anchors</h2><p>Biological anchors are a set of reference points or estimates used in forecasting the development of transformative AI systems. These anchors are inspired by biological systems, particularly the human brain, and provide a basis for estimating the computational requirements of AI systems capable of performing transformative tasks. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/KrJfoZzpSDpnrv9va/draft-report-on-ai-timelines\"><u>draft report on AI timelines</u></a> in Sep 2020 by Ajeya Cotra details the methodology used, addressing several questions:</p><ol><li><strong>How much computation does the human brain perform?&nbsp;</strong>According to the report, the brain has an estimated 10^15 total synapses. With each synapse spiking approximately once per second and each spike representing roughly one floating point operation (FLOP), the brain's computational power is estimated to range between 10^13 and 10^17 FLOP/S. This variance takes into account the potential efficiency differences between human brains and computers.</li><li><strong>How much training would it take to replicate this much inferential computation?&nbsp;</strong>It's important to note that training computation differs from inferential computation. Modern ML practices involve training advanced models on massive supercomputers and running them on medium-sized ones. An adult human\u2019s inference computation power is estimated at ~10^16 FLOP/S. To account for the total training computation costs, the report multiplies the computation of a single brain (10^15 FLOP/S) by the time taken from childhood to adolescence (10^9 seconds). This gives a lower bound estimate of 10^24 FLOP. However, the estimate increases to 10^41 FLOP when also considering the training data ingrained in our biology through evolution.</li><li><strong>How can we adjust this computation estimate for algorithmic progress?&nbsp;</strong>An algorithmic efficiency report suggests the training efficiency for Neural Networks doubles every sixteen months. Cotra proposes a slightly longer doubling time of 2-3 years.</li><li><strong>How much money does this amount of computation cost?</strong> In 2020, computational resources were priced at $1 for 10^17 FLOP/S, implying that 10^33 FLOP/S would cost $10^16 (ten quadrillion dollars). This cost decreases annually, with some versions of Moore\u2019s Law suggesting that compute costs halve every eighteen months. As a result, training costs (in FLOP/S) will reduce over time due to algorithmic progress, and the cost of FLOP/S (in dollars) will also decrease due to hardware advancements.</li><li><strong>What year does this computational cost become reasonable?&nbsp;</strong>The median result is a 10% chance by 2031, a 50% chance by 2052, and an 80% chance by 2100.</li></ol><p>Cotra acknowledges potential limitations with this approach, such as the assumption that progress relies on an easily-measured quantity (FLOP/S) rather than on fundamental advances, like new algorithms. Therefore, even with affordable, abundant computation, if we lack the algorithmic knowledge to create a proper thinking machine, any resulting AI might not display human level or superintelligent capabilities.</p><p>The following graph gives an overview of the findings. Overall, the graph takes a weighted average of the different ways that the trajectory could flow. This gives us an estimate of a &gt;10% chance of transformative AI by 2036, a ~50% chance by 2055, and an ~80% chance by 2100.</p><p><strong><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YcFpJC5pJFdYdEuNN/enuzi8vbiou15dmrj7ik\"></strong>Source: Holden Karnofsky (2021) \"<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vCaEnTbZ5KbypaGsm/forecasting-transformative-ai-the-biological-anchors-method\"><u>Forecasting transformative AI: the \"biological anchors\" method in a nutshell</u></a>\"</p><p>In 2022 a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/AfH2oPHCApdKicM4m/two-year-update-on-my-personal-ai-timelines\"><u>two-year update</u></a> on the author\u2019s (Ajeya Cotra) timelines was published.

These definitions sketch different trajectories the world could follow as transformative AI emerges.<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/s/3ni2P2GZzBvNebWYZ/p/YcFpJC5pJFdYdEuNN#fn9d83odnkksd\"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p><p>While timelines address when certain capabilities may emerge, takeoff dynamics explore what happens after these features surface. This chapter concludes with a section discussing various researchers' perspectives on the potential trajectories of an intelligence explosion, considering factors such as takeoff speed, continuity, and homogeneity. This includes a discussion of - first, the pace and continuity of an intelligence explosion, and second, whether multiple AIs will coexist, each having different objectives, or whether they will eventually converge towards a single superintelligent entity.</p><h2>6.1: Speed/Continuity</h2><p>Both AI takeoff speed and AI takeoff continuity describe the trajectory of AI development. Takeoff speed refers to the rate at which AI progresses or advances. Generally, takeoff continuity refers to the smoothness or lack of sudden jumps in AI development. Continuous takeoff means that the capabilities trajectory aligns with the expected progress based on past trends, while discontinuous takeoff refers to a trajectory that significantly exceeds the expected progress. FOOM is one type of fast takeoff scenario, and refers to a hypothetical scenario in which artificial intelligence (AI) rapidly and explosively surpasses human intelligence and capabilities.</p><p>The terms \"slow takeoff\" and \"soft takeoff\" are often used interchangeably, and similarly \"fast takeoff\" and \"hard takeoff\" and \u201cFOOM\u201d are also often used interchangeably. It's important to note that the definitions and implications of takeoff speed and takeoff continuity are still subjects of debate and may not be universally agreed upon by researchers in the field. Here are perspectives:</p><p><i><u>Slow/Soft takeoff</u></i></p><p>When discussing takeoff speeds, Paul Christiano emphasizes the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sideways-view.com/2018/02/24/takeoff-speeds/\"><u>parallel growth of AI capabilities and productivity</u></a>. He expects a slow takeoff in the development of AGI based on his characterization of takeoff speeds and his analysis of economic growth rates. He defines slow takeoff as a scenario where there will be a complete interval of several years in which world economic output doubles before the first interval of one year in which world economic output doubles. This definition emphasizes a gradual transition to higher growth rates. Overall, he postulates that the rise in AI capabilities will mirror an exponential growth pattern in the world GDP, resulting in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/CjW4axQDqLd2oDCGG/misconceptions-about-continuous-takeoff#Continuous_doesn_t_necessarily_mean_slow\"><u>continuous but moderate takeoff</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>In a similar vein, there&nbsp;have been <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Mha5GA5BfWcpf2jHC/potential-bottlenecks-to-taking-over-the-world\">some discussions</a> that the real obstacle to global domination is not the enhancement of cognitive abilities but more significant bottlenecks like avoiding coordinated human resistance and the physical acquisition and deployment of resources. These supply chain optimizations would increase productivity, hence GDP, which could serve as a measure for the speed of \"AI takeoff\".</p><p><i><u>Fast/Hard takeoff</u></i></p><p>A hard takeoff refers to a sudden, rather than gradual, transition to superintelligence, counter to the soft takeoff mentioned above. Eliezer Yudkowsky advocates for this view, suggesting a sudden and discontinuous change brought about by rapid self-improvement, while others, like Robin Hanson, support a more gradual, spread-out process. Yudkowsky argues that even regular improvement of AI by humans may cause significant leaps in capability to occur before recursive self-improvement begins.</p><p>Eliezer Yudkowsky also offers a counter to continuous takeoff proponents. He predicts a quick and abrupt \"intelligence explosion\". This is because he rather doesn't expect AI to be integrated (quickly) enough into the economy for the GDP to increase significantly faster before FOOM. It is also possible that superintelligent AIs could mislead us about their capabilities, leading to lower-than-expected GDP growth. This would be followed by a sudden leap, or \"FOOM\", when the AI acquires a substantial ability to influence the world, potentially overwhelming human technological and governance institutions.</p><p>These diverse views on takeoff speeds and continuity shape the strategies for AI safety, influencing how it should be pursued. Overall it is worth emphasizing that both fast and slow takeoffs are quite rapid (as in at most a few years). Here are some picture to help illustrate the differences:</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YcFpJC5pJFdYdEuNN/ccbzsbjllbtswsw7wpm0\"></figure></td><td><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YcFpJC5pJFdYdEuNN/usodbaiascosfv8oalvw\"></figure></td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Slow (No Intelligence Explosion) continuous Takeoff</strong></td><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Slow (No Intelligence Explosion) discontinuous takeoff</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YcFpJC5pJFdYdEuNN/u8smklx4wpeshsndxqb2\"></figure></td><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/lesswrong-2-0/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YcFpJC5pJFdYdEuNN/jvvxezelezmlhanen9io\"></figure></td></tr><tr><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Fast (Intelligence Explosion) Continuous Takeoff</strong></td><td style=\"padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><strong>Fast (Intelligence Explosion) discontinuous takeoff</strong></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><br>Source: Samuel Dylan Martin, Daniel_Eth (Sep 2021) \u201c<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/pGXR2ynhe5bBCCNqn/takeoff-speeds-and-discontinuities\"><u>Takeoff Speeds and Discontinuities</u></a>\u201d</p><h2>6.2: Homogeneity</h2><p><i><strong>Homogeneity</strong> refers to the similarity among different AI systems in play during the development and deployment of advanced AI.</i></p><ul><li>Hubinger, Evan (Dec 2020) \u201c<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/mKBfa8v4S9pNKSyKK/homogeneity-vs-heterogeneity-in-ai-takeoff-scenarios\"><u>Homogeneity vs. heterogeneity in AI takeoff scenarios</u></a>\u201d</li></ul><p>In a homogenous scenario, AI systems are anticipated to be highly similar, even identical, in their alignment and construction. For example, if every deployed system depends on the same model behind a single API, or if a single foundational model is trained and then fine-tuned in different ways by different actors. Homogeneity in AI systems could simplify cooperation and coordination, given their structural similarities. It also signifies that the alignment of the first advanced AI system is crucial, as it will likely influence future AI systems. One key factor for homogeneity is the economic incentives surrounding AI development and deployment. As the cost of training AI systems is expected to be significantly higher than the cost of running them, it becomes more economically advantageous to use existing AI systems rather than training new ones from scratch. This creates a preference for reusing or fine-tuning existing AI systems, leading to a higher likelihood of homogeneity in the deployed AI landscape</p><h2>6.3: Polarity</h2><p><i><strong>Unipolar</strong> refers to a scenario where a single agent or organization dominates and controls the world, while&nbsp;<strong>multipolar</strong> refers to a scenario where multiple entities coexist with different goals and levels of cooperation.</i></p><p>AI homogeneity evaluates the alignment similarities among AI systems, AI polarity examines the coexistence of both aligned and misaligned AI systems in a given context.</p><p>We might expect a unipolar takeoff, where a single AI system or project gains a decisive strategic advantage, due to several reasons. One key factor is the potential for a rapid takeoff, characterized by a fast increase in AI capabilities. If one project achieves a significant lead in AI development and surpasses others in terms of capabilities, it can establish a dominant position before competitors have a chance to catch up. A rapid takeoff can facilitate a unipolar outcome by enabling the leading project to quickly deploy its advanced AI system and gain a monopoly on the technology. This monopoly can provide substantial economic advantages, such as windfall profits, which further solidify the leading project's power and influence. Additionally, the presence of network effects can contribute to a unipolar takeoff. If the leading AI system becomes widely adopted and integrated into various sectors, it can create positive feedback loops that reinforce its dominance and make it increasingly difficult for other projects to compete.</p><p>We might expect a multipolar takeoff, where multiple AI projects undergo takeoff concurrently, due to several reasons. One factor is the potential for a slower takeoff process, which allows for more projects to reach advanced stages of AI development. In a slow takeoff scenario, there is a greater likelihood of multiple projects undergoing the transition in parallel, without any single project gaining a decisive strategic advantage. Another reason is the possibility of shared innovations and tools among AI projects. If there is a significant level of collaboration and information sharing, it can lead to a more distributed landscape of AI capabilities, enabling multiple projects to progress simultaneously. Furthermore, the presence of non-competitive dynamics, such as cooperation and mutual scrutiny, can contribute to a multipolar takeoff. In a scenario where different AI projects recognize the importance of safety and alignment, they may be more inclined to work together and ensure that each project progresses in a responsible manner.</p><h1>Acknowledgements</h1><p>Thanks to Charbel-Rapha\u00ebl Segerie, Jeanne Salle, Bogdan Ionut Cirstea, Nemo, Gurvan, and the many course participants of ML4G France, ML4G Germany, and AISF Sweden for helpful comments and feedback.</p><h1>Meta-Notes</h1><ul><li>The objective of the overall project is to write something that can be used as a introductory textbook to AI Safety. The rough audience is ML masters students, or audiences that have a semi technical background e.g Physics and get them up to speed on the core arguments. The intent is not to cover literally every single argument under the sky. There can obviously be a 102 version of the text that covers more nuance. I am especially trying to account for reading time and keep it roughly in the range of 40-60 mins per chapter. Which means I have to often make decisions on what to include, and at what level of detail.</li><li>I consider this a work-in-progress project. After much encouragement by others, I decided to publish what I have so far to get further feedback and comments.</li><li>If there are any mistakes or I have misrepresented anyone's views please let me know. I will make sure to correct it. Feel free to suggest improvements to flow/content additions/deletions/etc... How do people feel about the embedded videos? Would it better with just text?</li><li>The two sections that will probably undergo the most change in the near future are:<ul><li>3.3: Formalizing capabilities</li><li>4.2: Instrumental Convergence: It has been mentioned that Orthogonality has not been explained thoroughly enough.</li><li>6.0: Takeoff dynamics: Takeoff is always very tricky to talk about. I am not happy with the section as it stands. At the very least I want to include the report - Open Philanthropy (June 2023) \u201c<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/what-a-compute-centric-framework-says-about-takeoff-speeds/\"><u>What a compute-centric framework says about takeoff speeds</u></a>\u201d and just overall refine the arguments being made with more sources.</li></ul></li><li>There is also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Zb8ccNj-24dKtSyg6e56Irh15JV8uLRL9Ilq9akJmqw/edit?usp=sharing\">a google docs version</a>&nbsp;in case you prefer to leave comments there.</li><li>The general structure of the overall book/sequence will follow AI Safety fundamentals, however, there have been significant changes and additions to individual chapters in terms of content added/deleted.</li><li>When large portions of a section are drawn from an individual paper/post the reference is placed directly under the title. The sections serve as summarizations of the post. If you wish you can directly refer to the original papers/posts as well. The intent was to provide a single coherent flow of arguments all in one place.</li></ul><h1>Sources</h1><ul><li>Ngo, Richard (Jan 2022) \"<a href=\"https://medium.com/@richardcngo/visualizing-the-deep-learning-revolution-722098eb9c5\"><u>Visualizing the deep learning revolution\"</u></a></li><li>Bommasani, Rishi et. al.
