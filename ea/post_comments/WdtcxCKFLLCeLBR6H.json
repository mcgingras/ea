Just like people have different tastes for risk level in their financial investments, so to in their philanthropic investments.

People diversify their financial investments because low risk doesn't yield that much whereas high yield is also high risk, so they hold various levels of risk in their portfolio (or even within the same risk level, it's lower risk to have multiple investments, of course). This even makes sense if someone wanted to hold only high risk (long term) donations in their philanthropic portfolio: they may feel that putting all their money on, for instance, fighting corruption, is a long shot, so may feel comfort in giving half their donations to promoting morals. In this case, the risk level is still high, but it will give the donor the psychological comfort that he has TWO chances of improving the world, rather that just one! </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>You associate long term EA with weirdness, and I agree that the public would see AI, and some other forms of x-risk that way, but there are so many other long-term high impact pursuits that are not weird: research on behavioural economics; designing technologies that help the poor along with their distribution and marketing systems; decreasing corruption including political reform; restructuring our economic and monetary systems to make them more fair and egalitarian; promoting more moral or sustainable lifestyles like veganism; lobbying; green tech; medical tech. I don't think people would find any of these weird. </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>As someone on the forum stated earlier, people tend to be more motivated to make the world better, rather than deal with sad things like extreme poverty. I think that's probably true. When promoting EA, would it not be ideal to have a little \u201csomething for everybody\u201d? ie. For those with bleeding hearts, immediate measures for helping the global poor; for tech-oriented people developing high-impact technologies; for \u201csave the world from injustice\u201d types, combating corruption.
