What this means is that some may be stubbornly committed to these beliefs because it reinforces problematic prejudices they already hold (ie. to be White and told on average you are more intelligent etc.), and sometimes it is just more convenient for other reasons (ie. to be a committed follower of Bostrom wishing to remain loyal). Whatever the case, there's definitely a lot more going on here than a stoic consideration of the evidence, because the mainstream, widely accepted consideration of the evidence does not support the claim. I'd encourage those on the fence to reflect more on where their biases lie in what kind of evidence they choose to accept rather than reject. There is nothing noble about doubling down on beliefs that are both actively harmful and disproven, in order to maintain a personally convenient worldview. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I suspect you are someone that will remain stubborn in your beliefs despite any contradicting evidence, so I won't engage further in this debate.

Race scholars have written about this at length and I have personally experienced many pleasant people with objectively prejudiced and problematic beliefs. The belief that \"black people are on average less intelligent than white people\" is considered by many (including myself, and pretty much every race scholar) to be a racist belief. You are entitled to hold a racist belief, of course, but it doesn't make sense to deny it as such for personal comfort or whatever other arbritrary reasons, or to distort the definition of racism by falsely claiming that because you hold no personal animus to Black people, you cannot adhere to explicitly racist beliefs.&nbsp;</p><p>(2) The \"scientific evidence\" you link to has been widely discredited as pseudo-science, to the point where much of that work has been rescinded from publication (if it was even ever peer-reviewed in the first place). Many of those that work on race science were found to have had an explicit racist agenda, and manipulated findings for the purpose of promoting it. I won't do the work of repeating what many others have discussed - you can check out the appendix of this blog post for that research: <a href=\"https://ineffectivealtruismblog.com/2023/01/12/off-series-that-bostrom-email/\">https://ineffectivealtruismblog.com/2023/01/12/off-series-that-bostrom-email/</a></p>", "parentCommentId": "twFeQftFMXvxvQAcZ", "user": {"username": "not_applicable"}}, {"_id": "eWe2Enwyqt5f9Tz9Q", "postedAt": "2023-01-19T09:11:19.214Z", "postId": "NniTsDNQQo58hnxkr", "htmlBody": "<blockquote>\n<p>Your claim that \"blacks are less intelligent..\" is pretty much as widely discredited as Holocaust denial (2), supported with as sparse evidence as the latter.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think this is completely wrong as an empirical statement.
