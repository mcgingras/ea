At present, OP would be ~ $22.6MM of a $28.2MM budget, with other established donors at ~ $2MM and a funding gap of ~ $3.6MM. In other words, depending on how much of the gap was filled, OP would be funding somewhere between 80 and 92% of the budget. &nbsp;Where the actual percentage is within that range has ~ zero impact on my assessment of COI risk, and not too much more impact on my assessment of its potential influence on CEA more generally.

I'm sure hypothetical me could earmark those funds, but money is fungible. I'm not sure I am getting much \"vote\" for my $1MM.&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand -- given that non-GCR meta seems much more thinly funded than GCR and GCR-leaning meta -- $1MM could have a pretty significant effect if the donor figured out a way to counterfactually increase non-GCR meta spending by other organizations by most of $1MM. So the opportunity cost of improving CEA's funder diversity to a donor interested in non-GCR meta seems fairly high.
