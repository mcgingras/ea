If this turns out to be an Enron/ Madoff situation, I don't know if I can trust you anymore. I don't know if I should stay in EA.

The books are rigorous, and have been praised by many of the world's leading psychiatrists and experts in hemispheric specialization. These books could have told you that EA was destined to fail from the beginning. Here's the blurb for the first of these books:</p><blockquote><p>Why is the brain divided? The difference between right and left hemispheres has been puzzled over for centuries. Drawing upon a vast body of brain research, the renowned psychiatrist, author, and thinker Iain McGilchrist reveals that the difference between the two sides is profound\u2015two whole, coherent, but incompatible ways of experiencing the world. The detail-oriented left hemisphere prefers mechanisms to living things and is inclined to self-interest, while the right hemisphere has greater breadth, flexibility, and generosity.<br><br>In the second part of his book, McGilchrist takes the reader on a journey through the history of Western culture, illustrating the tension between these two worlds as revealed in the thought and belief of thinkers and artists from the ancient to the modern, from Aeschylus to Magritte. He ultimately argues that, despite its inferior grasp of reality, the left hemisphere is increasingly taking precedence in today\u2019s world\u2015with potentially disastrous consequences.</p></blockquote><p>Reading these books makes it clear that the downfall of EA was predictable, has historical precedent, and has a clear neurological basis. The tools of EA (standardized epistemic rules, forecasting, and so on) cannot save us, because the EA community has made a point of consistently relying on the least reliable and least insightful hemisphere of our brains.</p><p>I know that this may sound wacky, but I really, really, <i>really</i> strongly recommend reading these books. They will bring everything into focus, and make what went wrong look painfully obvious. Here is a short <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFs9WO2B8uI\">YouTube video</a> that gives a short summary of the ideas in the first book, if you are interested (though the YouTube video is no substitute for actually reading the book).</p><p>And <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDHJDKPeB2A\">here is a talk</a> by V.S. Ramachandran that discusses hemispheric specialization. <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V._S._Ramachandran\">Ramachandran</a> is one of, if not <i>the </i>world's leading neuroscientists (who, by the way, speaks highly of McGilchrist's work). Again, watching Ramachandran's talk is no substitute for reading McGilchrist's books. But it will be enough to show you just how wacky an over-reliance on the left hemisphere can get, which should be enough to at least pique your interest.</p><p>Best of luck, Will.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": null}, {"_id": "xvFxcf7MC2GvRckBE", "postedAt": "2022-11-12T20:16:09.506Z", "postId": "WdeiPrwgqW2wHAxgT", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for posting this, Dean.

This reads as almost bizarre: it would be a baby-eater-type conspiracy theory to think that Will (or anyone else in EA leadership) knew about this. &nbsp;That's just not how things work in the world. The vast majority of people at Alameda/FTX didn't know (inner circle may have been as small as four). I mean, maybe there's a tiny chance that Sam phoned up someone a week ago and wanted a billion in secret, but you can see how ridiculous that sounds. I mean picture the conversation: \"Hey [EA leader], turns out I fucked up. Can you wire me a billion? You're down with me secretly trading with customer funds, right?\"<br><br>In any case, I think that isn't Kerry's point. The point isn't \"Did Will know about concrete fraud,\" but rather, \"Was there reason to think fraud is unusually likely? And if so, did people take the types of precautions that you'd want to take if you thought you were dealing with someone capable of doing shady things?\"</p><p>For comparison, think of Zuckerberg. If the Social Network movie is roughly accurate, then Zuckerberg acted in utterly despicable and unethical ways, lying to the Winklevoss twins repeatedly and stealing their idea (and then screwing over the guy played by Justin Timberlake). So anyone aware of this would've been faced with the choice to (1) not trust him at all and not invest in facebook or associate with him; (2) trust him like you'd trust any nice-seeming person without a suspicious history; (3) try to talk to him (e.g., give feedback, try to lecture or mentor, etc.) about how that was unacceptable, ask for concrete ways for him to change, maybe use leverage you have to set up good governance structures and accountability procedures or at least nudge things that way, etc. I'd say (2) is clearly stupid and immoral. (3) might be defensible depending on one's judgment call (and subsequent execution), and (1) can certainly be appropriate. In the case of facebook, I don't know if Zuckerberg got any feedback from anyone or how facebook set up its board or accountability procedures, but it <i>looks like</i>, <i>so far</i>, that Zuckerberg never ended up doing anything crazy illegal that destroyed billions in value.

You are sufficiently visible in the EA space that your views on financial probity materially affect the state of EA discourse. What you are telling me is that the policies which you wrote don't include a 'no undeclared sexual relationships with people who are supposed to act as a check on you defrauding MIRI' rule, based on your view that it is excessively paternalistic to inquire about people's sex life when assessing risk, and that your view is that this is the position that should be adopted in EA spaces generally.</p>\n<p>This is - to put it mildly - not the view of the vast majority of organisations which handle money at any significant scale. No sane risk management approach would equate a romantic relationship with 'a very strong friendship'. Romantic love is qualitatively different to fraternal love.  No sane risk management approach would equate \"occasionally spend[ing] time at each other's house\" to living together. My wife is often alone in the house for extended periods of time, but I usually hang out with friends when they come over (to give just one difference from an enormous list of possibilities).</p>\n<p>EA leadership - which includes you - has clearly made a catastrophic error of financial risk management with this situation. The extent to which they are 'responsible' is a fair debate, but it is unquestionable they failed to protect people who trusted them to steer EA into the future - hundreds of people have been made unemployed overnight and EA is potentially facing its first existential risk as a result. I am genuinely baffled how you can look at this situation and conclude that the approach you are describing - a very intelligent non-expert such as yourself creates their own standards of financial conduct at significant odds with the mainstream accepted approach - could still possibly be appropriate in the face of the magnitude of the error this thinking has led to.</p>\n<p>I also think it is extremely unedifying that you make the case elsewhere that the disagreement votes you are recieving for your position are from vote manipulation. A more plausible explanation is that people have independently reached the conclusion you are wrong that romantic love presents no special financial risks.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "ZRPQLpxzojZG42LnG", "user": {"username": "AnonymousRiskGuy"}}, {"_id": "nt3Dqet3rzW5FHrdj", "postedAt": "2022-11-13T23:48:30.424Z", "postId": "WdeiPrwgqW2wHAxgT", "htmlBody": "<p>Somebody else in that thread was preemptively yelling \"vote manipulation!\" and \"voting ring!\", and as much as it sounds recursively strange, this plus some voting patterns (early upvotes, then suddenly huge amounts of sudden downvoting) did lead me to suspect that the poster in question was running a bunch of fake accounts and voting with them.</p><p>We would in fact be concerned if it turned out that two people who were supposed to have independent eyes on the books were in a relationship and didn't tell us! &nbsp;And we'd try to predictably conduct ourselves in such a mature, adult, understanding, and non-pearl-clutching fashion that it would be completely safe for those two people to tell the MIRI Board, \"Hey, we've fallen in love, you need to take auditing responsibility off one of us and move it to somebody else\" and have us respond to that in a completely routine, nonthreatening, and unexcited way that created no financial or reputational penalties for us being told about it.</p><p>That's what I think is the healthy, beneficial, and <i>actually useful for minimizing actual fraud in real life</i> culture, of which I do think present EA has some, and which I think is being threatened by performative indignation.</p>", "parentCommentId": "GPMZXsJDiwGvbF7aA", "user": {"username": "EliezerYudkowsky"}}, {"_id": "GykdRxKuq2HPsmCow", "postedAt": "2022-11-14T00:17:36.577Z", "postId": "WdeiPrwgqW2wHAxgT", "htmlBody": "<p>I'm struggling to follow your argument here.
