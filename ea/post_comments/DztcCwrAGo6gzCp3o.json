I sadly never had the pleasure of meeting Alexa. I now wish I had. But I can tell from this heartfelt post and the website linked that they were a bright light in the dark and vast sea that the world can sometimes feel like. I love the stories you shared. Simple acts of kindness and empathy that reverberate through space and time and impact humans and non-human animals alike. No doubt that there are so many beings that will remember Alexa and their impact.&nbsp;</p><p>Oddly, I'm reminded of a lyric from one of my favorite albums of the last few years:<br><br>\"Afraid of the empty/but too safe on the shore\"<br><br>As someone who is around Alexa's age, I often feel too safe on the shore. Never fully being the kind of person that I should be. Sticking with what's familiar and comfortable. I hate to say it, but I've been the person who has walked past the unconscious man lying on the payment. I'm terrified of the empty. I've been cowardly.&nbsp;</p><p>Alexa seemed like the kind of person who went out into the empty, the vast sea, with a smile and big heart. And who wasn't afraid to be the kind of person that most of us will spend our entire lives trying to become (and may never reach).&nbsp;</p><p>Their story has affected me deeply. I look forward to processing Alexa's stories, and how they can inspire me and many others to be a little braver in the face of the open ocean of life and its challenges, and how we can do that with a little more empathy, gentleness, and compassion.</p><p>I'm so sorry for the loss of your dear friend.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "GreenByrdhouse"}}, {"_id": "G7BZan6AtQhenJFvz", "postedAt": "2023-03-06T20:38:48.184Z", "postId": "DztcCwrAGo6gzCp3o", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for writing this beautiful tribute.

It is hard to look clear-eyed at the sheer amount of suffering and cruelty in this world without shifting into calculus (i.e., only pursuing cost-effective solutions) or complacency.

Often how I want to grieve people is just to remember them in detail, saying: <em>they were here, not like anyone else, but specifically <strong>this</strong> is the way they were; I remember, and I wish they were still in the world</em>.

They are gone to feed the roses.  Elegant and curled<br>\nIs the blossom.  Fragrant is the blossom.  I know.  But I do not approve.<br>\nMore precious was the light in your eyes than all the roses in the world.</p>\n<p>Down, down, down into the darkness of the grave<br>\nGently they go, the beautiful, the tender, the kind;<br>\nQuietly they go, the intelligent, the witty, the brave.<br>\nI know.
