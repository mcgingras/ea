Example - in a dream last week all my teeth fell out which was pretty distressing, and nothing as interesting happened to me in waking life. How emotional/ extreme an experience is seems like a good proxy for how good or bad it is. So probably the best and worse experiences you've had last week were whilst you were dreaming.</p></blockquote><p><br>And also gwern's comment:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>My own observation is that while my dreams are not infrequently quite unpleasant and nightmarish in content, a corresponding emotional reaction is not there. Many dreams ought to have one waking up in a cold sweat, heart pounding, unable to focus for the rest of the day. (Why aren't <i>all</i> bad dreams <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Night_terror\">\"night terrors\"</a>? Why does it decrease with age, and correlate with psychiatric problems?) But even if one were to write them down (and I did for a while in a dream journal) to block forgetting, I feel back to normal practically upon waking, and definitely within a short time.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "jablevine"}}]
