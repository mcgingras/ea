The role I played was in the context of my work as a community liaison at CEA.</p><p>(All parts that mention specific people were run past those people.)</p><p>In 2021, the woman who described traveling to a job interview in the TIME piece told me about her interactions with Owen Cotton-Barratt several years before. She said she found many aspects of his interactions with her to be inappropriate.&nbsp;</p><p>We talked about what steps she wanted taken. Based on her requests, I had conversations with Owen and some of his colleagues. I tried to make sure that Owen understood the inappropriateness of his behavior and that steps were taken to reduce the risk of such things happening again. Owen apologized to the woman. The woman wrote to me to say that she felt relieved and appreciated my help. Later, I wrote about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fovDwkBQgTqRMoHZM/power-dynamics-between-people-in-ea\"><u>power dynamics</u></a> based partly on this situation.</p><p>However, I think I didn\u2019t do enough to address the risk of his behavior continuing in other settings. I didn\u2019t pay enough attention to what other pieces might need addressing, like the fact that, by the time I learned about the situation, he was on the board of EV UK (then called CEA UK), or the areas where he could influence funding and career opportunities for other people.</p><p>No other women raised complaints about him to me, but I learned (in some cases from him) of a couple of other situations where his interactions with women in EA were questionable. None of these seemed as serious on their own from what I knew \u2014 one of the women summarized it as \"He apologized to me then, and I accepted it and things were / are totally fine.\u201d But they formed a pattern, and I should have taken that pattern more seriously.</p><p>A few months ago Owen told me about another more recent situation where, according to him, he had made another woman uncomfortable. I didn\u2019t reach out to the woman about this at the time, which I now think was a mistake. I understand EV UK and EV US\u2019s external investigation will look into what happened here.</p><p>I also didn\u2019t seek adequate backup given that I was friends with Owen. (Owen and I live in different countries and were not close friends, but we and our families have spent social time together.) When the woman in the TIME piece told me that her concern was about Owen, I flagged to her that I was friends with him. She and I decided to proceed anyway because we couldn\u2019t think of a better option, although she felt it was unhealthy for EA that people who had power were entwined in these ways.</p><p>If I had flagged the situation earlier and more thoroughly to others, they might have recognized the parts of the situation that I hadn\u2019t handled adequately. I should have thought more about how to get more help here or how to hand off the situation to someone else.</p><p>After reading the TIME piece, I flagged my worries about Owen\u2019s roles in EA to the EV UK and EV US boards. I had earlier flagged some parts of the situation to my manager, but not the whole picture.</p><p>I\u2019m really sorry that I didn\u2019t handle this better. It\u2019s really important to me that women in the community can do their best work without wondering if they\u2019ll be treated unfairly, be hit on in professional contexts, or worse.&nbsp;</p><p>I understand that EV UK and EV US will be working with external evaluators to assess my and my team\u2019s processes here and evaluating the choices that I and my manager made in handling this situation. I will also be reflecting further on my own and with my team.<br><br>I\u2019m guessing that my mistakes here may mean some people will feel less comfortable bringing problems to me. For unrelated reasons, over the last two months my team had moved most of our work on interpersonal harm to my colleague Catherine Low, who was not involved in this situation.

They talked to affected parties and came to some decision that didn't call for a public apology or Owen stepping down.

Even so, subjective judgment calls about how much someone learned from mistakes are risky to rely on all by themselves. In this particular instance, I can sympathize with wanting to take a forgiving stance. One reason I was extremely surprised about this post and the circumstances behind it is because I knew Owen (not very closely, but it still felt like a strong impression) as someone who's unusually committed to high integrity and modest and forthcoming about mistakes he might be making, etc. Still, there's a strong case that there should be procedures that call for more \"objective\" actions when complaints of this sort come to light and are even corroborated (\"corroborated\" in the sense that Owen, given his apology, must have agreed about many facts of what happened, even if he highlighted things that the person who complained about him may not have highlighted or may have thought about differently). So, instead of just making a judgment call about whether the person learned the most from mistakes, I think it would've been more appropriate to make a public statement about the incident. This would've put more eyes on Owen's behavior in this area and brought about the conditions for better accountability.&nbsp;</p><p>Personally, I think \"removal from the board\" wouldn't necessarily be warranted if this had been handled differently at the time when it happened (but as I say further below, some kind of public statement and apology seemed warranted!). But I think it would've made sense to ask Owen to step down from mentorship-type roles?<br><br>I &nbsp;think that if we just looked at the specific actions, the measures taken should probably be more severe than I just described them. However, if we then add extra context and if I go with my best guess about everything that Owen was thinking and so on, I pretty much believe the account he gave in the apology.&nbsp;<br><br>Since things didn't come out earlier, I want to say that I don't feel like it's good that basically nothing happened at the time. Even if the community health team has good judgment about these sorts of things (whether someone made genuine mistakes instead of deliberately using their position of power to push boundaries), it's much safer for incentives and overall accountability if they draw public eyes on this in some way (perhaps keeping some measure of discretion). (Edit: Also conflict of interest concerns!) To help with that, it would be good if the \"public eye\" has enough nuance to distinguish cases like the one here from things that would be significantly worse, and not call for the most extreme punitive measures in all cases. My impression is that the EA community is probably good at preserving this sort of nuance (or at least was so before the recent series of polarizing scandals), even though I often see EA forum comments that I disagree with in one direction or the other \u2013 too lenient or too strict for my taste for a given situation.</p>", "parentCommentId": "QP4BAAd9qqGYiBZhR", "user": {"username": "Lukas_Gloor"}}, {"_id": "smebhCoySEE4s8opo", "postedAt": "2023-02-21T02:17:07.340Z", "postId": "9JCkkjKMNL4Hmg4qP", "htmlBody": "<p>A comment I made a few days ago said \"But usually very little changes until someone goes public (at least anonymously).

I had seen these guidelines, but it may be helpful to use them to elaborate on what I mean. I think this code of conduct isn't sufficient per the criteria I outlined, in that:</p><ol><li>It lacks a working definition of sexual harassment. The statement says \"unwanted sexual attention, or sexual harassment of any kind.\" This suggests that sexual harassment is different from unwanted sexual attention, but doesn't make clear what the latter is.</li><li>These guidelines don't clarify how expectations regarding appropriate behavior may differ at different kinds of EA events, since \"EA Global or related events\" are lumped together. I think there's a fair bit of consensus that norms regarding behavior should differ between, e.g., &nbsp;EAG after parties and 1-on-1 meetings. (I think <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/nathan?mention=user\">@Nathan Young</a> ran some polls that suggested people endorse something along these lines, although a more formal survey would be helpful.)&nbsp;</li><li>Taken literally, these guidelines don't seem to map onto community norms\u2014including, I think, totally reasonable ones\u2014regarding appropriate conduct. For instance, \"These behaviors don't belong at EA Global or related events: Unwanted sexual attention\" would seem to suggest that if Amy hit on Bob at an EAG after party (\"related event\"), and he politely rebuffed her (\"unwanted sexual attention\") and she stopped, Amy would have violated the code of conduct. In practice, I don't think the Bobs of EA would ever report the Amys for this behavior, but that's kind of the problem! &nbsp;If the code of conduct conflicts with established norms in the community\u2014which will be much more powerful drivers of behavior\u2014then they aren't very helpful.&nbsp;</li><li>These guidelines only apply to EAGs/EAGxs (right?), and thus wouldn't apply to, e.g., the misconduct OCB engaged in.</li></ol><p>I think the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/s5zDhfyRPvrpeuRf8/p/yND9aGJgobm5dEXqF\">Guide to norms on the Forum</a> may serve as a useful point of comparison here: these guidlines are detailed, thorough, clear, and include helpful examples. Similarly, I think the most useful part of the EAG code of conduct is this: \"These behaviors don't belong at EA Global... using the event app to request meetings for romantic or sexual reasons.\" <i>That </i>is helpful and clear guidance. Presumably, other kinds of specific behaviors (and why they're problematic or not) could similarly be mentioned and discussed. Indeed, some of Julia's thoughts on this\u2014which are sprinkled around <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fovDwkBQgTqRMoHZM/power-dynamics-between-people-in-ea\">the Forum</a>\u2014could serve as a useful jumping-off point in developing this.</p><p>I worry that part of what's going on here is that CEA doesn't want to go on the record with a stance of \"here is when it's acceptable to hit on someone in EA\" because this isn't a stance it's seen as acceptable for a professional organization to hold. I can understand that, but if the practice of the community is to tolerate (and indeed, defend and embrace) people being able to connect romantically, then there should be clearer parameters around this.</p><p>If CEA doesn't want to go on the record with that position, perhaps it'd be worth establishing an independent committee to survey the community on the norms they'd want to see in place. Said committe could also assess and analyze other community's guidelines on this stuff (although I suspect most would be similarly vague and/or include blanket bans). These two things could then be used to develop clearer guidelines, which could be posted on the Forum and revised on the basis of community input.</p><p>Again, I know this stuff is really hard, and I do appreciate EAG having a code of conduct that makes clear that certain behaviors aren't allowed.

For the record, I\u2019m a woman.</p><p>TLTR:&nbsp; I feel that the reaction to the Times and Vox articles within the community starts to be abusive and highly problematic in itself. I feel unsafe and I may resign from being a part of the EA.&nbsp;</p><p>Let me check if I understand Owen\u2019s situation correctly \u2013 he acted in an inappropriate way multiple times.

X contacted Community Health Team. They reacted, in a way that X appreciated. She thanked. Owen apologized. Later on, X believed &nbsp;that the problem of sexual harassment within the community didn\u2019t disappear, so messaged the TIMES to do something about it. She has, however, contacted Owen and i.e. helped him write his statement. He is sorry, and is going to work on himself to address the problem.</p><p>Am I right?</p><p>If no, please correct me.&nbsp;</p><p>If yes: Owen is sorry, got his consequences (life-breaking consequences), he is going to change. We know his side of the story, and if he is not lying, he seems to me as a creepy guy who really fucked up, but not uprooted rapist. And I\u2019m saying \u2013 yes, let\u2019s make sure he and similar people are not a danger to anyone.

There are other attempts to suggest rigid rules for the whole community (i.e. suggesting not to \u201csleep around\u201d in general), many comments are polyphobic, people make multiple ableist statements (\u201cif you are socially awkward \u2013 don\u2019t have sex\u201d, \u201cbeing tolerant to weirdness is a problem\u201d).

I have a couple of concerns.&nbsp;</p><ol><li>&nbsp;I feel the community is on its best way to decide that sex is bad if it\u2019s not in closed monogamous relationships. I don\u2019t want to function in such community. I\u2019m polyamorous, I definitely tend to sleep around and I feel liberated by that, as I\u2019m from a religious, conservative culture. &nbsp;I feel that people want to impose rigid rules not where they are needed and prevent harm, but also where they stop freedom of others - my freedom - just to feel safe. I think it won't work, but it will cause harm. Also, as a poly person, I feel quite bullied and shamed. Could you please help address the issue here? At least polyphobia please.</li><li>Should I treat EA community as my workplace and not have sex with people who are just my friends? If no, what about men who are (in some, not direct ways \u2013 i.e. longer tenure in the EA) \u201cabove me\u201d in the EA power structure, who get my enthusiastic consent? Like, would it be not appropriate to ask them out?&nbsp;</li><li>I\u2019m not from American culture. Cultural norms in my country are quite different - also those regarding sexual behavior, and multiple -isms. I am afraid of making some mistake which hurts someone \u2013 but I always believed in this community people would communicate clearly, tell me what happened so I could apologize and address my behavior. Now, I'm afraid of being told that \u201ceverything is fine\u201d and getting burned to the ground later on. It may be stupid, but what do I even do about that? I would be scared to talk to some people now. And usually I pride myself to be very outspoken.&nbsp;</li><li>I know it's irrational, but currently I would be scared to report sexual misconduct to people I don't know well, or even to share my experiences with people who are not really close to me, as they may react very strongly (or may feel obliged to act very strongly) without any consideration to other's side basic well-being. I would never want to destroy person's life, I just want to be safe. Health Team's reactions were what I would like to see if I ever was a victim of some misconduct(I know you think you could do more) - and yet, you got a backlash for it. People may be afraid of such backlash and may try to react very strongly each time to avoid it.

This isn\u2019t what you\u2019re suggesting, but as a toy example to bring out this trade-off: if we state guidelines that are very specific (e.g. a list of things you mustn\u2019t do in specific contexts), we might fail to prevent harmful behaviour that isn\u2019t on the list. If our guidelines are something extremely wide in scope but non-specific (e.g. \u201cDo unto others as you would have them do unto you\u201d), they\u2019re hard to enforce because people can bend them to justify their behaviour (\u201cbut I would have felt fine if they hit on me!\u201d).</p><p>Here\u2019s something related that&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/AmfKu3xB2yGA8z9aZ/ea-global-and-eagx-megathread?commentId=xPkkcDpFkQyfofv4i\"><u>Julia wrote recently</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p>My sense is that pre-specified criteria for what constitutes something like \u201coffensive actions\u201d or \u201cunwanted sexual attention\u201d and what the response should be isn\u2019t realistic or a good idea. A lot of factors play into what constitutes a problem \u2014 words, body language, setting (the career fair vs. an afterparty vs. a deserted street outside the venue at night), power and status differences between the people, etc. Responses should be shaped by the wishes of the person who experienced the problem \u2014 people have different preferences about how much action they want us to take, whether they want us to act immediately or give them time to think over the options, etc.</p></blockquote><p>Another challenge is that CEA is the host of some events but not the host of some others associated with the conferences.

It's not clear to me that the guidelines have to be \"all-inclusive or nothing\". As an example, just because the guidelines say you can't use the swapcard app for dating purposes, it would be pretty unreasonable for people to interpret that as \"oh, the guidelines don't say I can't use the swapcard app to scam people, that must mean this is endorsed by CEA\".</p><p>And even if it's the case that the current guidelines don't explicitly comment against using swapcard to scam other attendees, and this contributes to some degree of \"failing to prevent harmful behaviour that isn't on the list\", that seems like a bad reason to choose to not state \"don't use swapcard for sexual purposes\".</p><p><strong>RE: guidelines that include helpful examples, </strong><a href=\"https://unfccc.int/about-us/code-of-conduct-for-unfccc-conferences-meetings-and-events\"><strong>here's one</strong></a> that I found from 10secs of googling.</p><ul><li><strong>First it defines </strong><a href=\"https://unfccc.int/about-us/code-of-conduct-for-unfccc-conferences-meetings-and-events#:~:text=Harassment%20is%20any%20improper%20or%20unwelcome%20conduct%20that%20might%20reasonably%20be%20expected%20or%20be%20perceived%20to%20cause%20offence%20or%20humiliation%20to%20another%20person.\"><strong>harrassment</strong></a><strong> and </strong><a href=\"https://unfccc.int/about-us/code-of-conduct-for-unfccc-conferences-meetings-and-events#:~:text=Sexual%20harassment%20is,or%20different%20genders.\"><strong>sexual harrassment</strong></a><strong> fairly broadly.</strong> Of course, what exactly counts as \"reasonably be expected or be perceived to cause offence or humiliation\" can differ between people, but this is a marginal improvement compared to current EAG guidelines that simply state \"unwanted sexual attention or sexual harrassment\".</li><li><strong>It then gives a </strong><a href=\"https://unfccc.int/about-us/code-of-conduct-for-unfccc-conferences-meetings-and-events#:~:text=Examples%20of%20harassment%20include%2C%20but%20are%20not%20limited%20to%3A\"><strong>non-exhaustive list</strong></a><strong> of fairly uncontroversial actions</strong> for its context - CEA can adopt its own standard! But I think it's fair to say that just because this list doesn't cover every possibility it doesn't necessarily mean the list is not worth including.</li><li>Notably, it also<strong> outlines a </strong><a href=\"https://unfccc.int/about-us/code-of-conduct-for-unfccc-conferences-meetings-and-events#:~:text=assault%2C%20including%20rape.-,Complaint%20process,-A%20participant%20who\"><strong>complaint process</strong></a><strong> and details possible actions</strong> that may reasonably occur in response to a complaint.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>&nbsp;As I responded to Julia's comment that you linked, I think these lists can be helpful because most reported cases are likely not from people intentionally wishing to cause harm, but differences in norms or communication or expectations around what might be considered harmful. Having a explicit list of actions helps get around these differences by being more precise about actions that are likely to be considered net negative in expectation. &nbsp;If it's the case that there are a lot of examples that are in a grey area, then this may be an argument to exclude those examples, but it isn't really an argument against having a list that contains less ambiguous examples.</p><p>Ditto RE: different settings - this is an argument to have narrower scope for the guidelines, and to not write a single guideline that is intended to cover both the career fair and the afterparty, but not an argument against expressing what's unacceptable under one specific setting (especially when that setting is something as crucial as \"EAG conference time\")</p><p>Lastly, RE: \"Responses should be shaped by the wishes of the person who experienced the problem\" - of course it should be! But a list of possible actions that might be taken can be helpful without committing the team to a set response, but the inclusion of potential actions that can be taken is still reassuring and helpful for people to know what can be possible.</p><p>Again, this was just the first link I clicked,<strong> I don't think it's perfect</strong>, but I think there are multiple aspects of this that CEA could use to help with further iterations of its guidelines.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Another challenge is that CEA is the host of some events but not the host of some others associated with the conferences. We can\u2019t force an afterparty host or a bar manager to agree to follow our guidelines though we sometimes collaborate on setting norms or encourage certain practices.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>I think it's fine to start from CEA's circle of influence and have good guidelines + norms for CEA events - if things go well this may incentivise other organisers to adopt these practices (or perhaps they won't adopt it, because the context is sufficiently different, which is fine too!) But even if other organisers don't adopt better guidelines, this doesn't seem like a particularly strong argument against adopting clearer guidelines for CEA events. The UNFCCC presumably aren't using \"oh, we can't control what happens in UN Youth events globally, and we can't force them to agree to follow our guidelines\" as an excuse to not have guidelines. But because they have their own guidelines, and many UN Youth events try to emulate what the UN event proper looks like, they will (at least try to) adopt a similar level of formality.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>One last reason to err on the side of more precise guidelines echoes <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9JCkkjKMNL4Hmg4qP/ev-uk-board-statement-on-owen-s-resignation?commentId=sL2dDpn9DSAqcJcur#sL2dDpn9DSAqcJcur\">point 3 </a>in what lilly shared above - if guidelines are vague and more open to interpretation by the Community Health team, this requires a higher level of trust in the CH team's track record and decision-making and management of CoIs, etc. To whatever extent recent events may reflect actual gaps in this process or even just a change in the perception here, erring on the side of clearer guidelines can help with accountability and trust building.</p>", "parentCommentId": "2H5oTJaKiciy24Gxo", "user": {"username": "bruce"}}, {"_id": "ZYkf4ihdz29DafxZi", "postedAt": "2023-03-07T10:35:25.368Z", "postId": "9JCkkjKMNL4Hmg4qP", "htmlBody": "<p>[Sorry for delay, there were a number of retreats / conferences recently].
