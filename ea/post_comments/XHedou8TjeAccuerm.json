I\u2019m very fond of black hole power. And I am assuming that maybe in a few trillion years I\u2019m going to be dealing with protesters saying, \u201cNo black holes in our neighbourhood,\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t build that power plant, Anders.\u201d But they\u2019re actually lovely. Black holes have <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accretion_disk\">accretion disks</a> when they suck in matter. Or rather, it\u2019s not that they suck in matter \u2014 that\u2019s kind of a picture we get from science fiction \u2014 they\u2019re just an object with gravity like anything else. But what happens when you put a lot of junk around a black hole? They form a disk, and the friction between parts of the disk heats up the matter. That means it radiates away energy and gets more tightly bound and slowly spirals in. There is also some angular momentum leaking out at the sides where some dust gets thrown off.</p><p>The effect of this is that the potential energy of that junk \u2014 and it can be anything: burnt-out stars, old cars, old space probes, planets you don\u2019t care for, et cetera \u2014 gets ground down, and the potential energy gets released as radiation. So now you can build a Dyson sphere, a very big one, around this whole system, and get all of that energy.</p><p>How much total mass energy can you get? It turns out it\u2019s almost up to 40% for a rapidly spinning black hole. The exact limit depends on where the inner edge of the accretion disk is, because eventually you get close enough that you essentially fall straight in without releasing any more energy, and that gets trapped inside the black hole. Now, converting 40% of the mass energy of old cars and space probes into energy is kind of astonishing: that is way more effective than fusion. <strong>So actually, the stars might not be the biggest energy source around. We might actually be able to make the galaxies shine much more if we dump things into black holes and gather that energy.</strong></p></blockquote><p>William, I am guessing you would like Anders' episodes!
