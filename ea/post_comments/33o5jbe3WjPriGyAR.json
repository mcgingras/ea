I like that there will be assigned owners of different projects, and I hope that outcomes of the Forum and information on initiatives that came out of it will also be shared with the community.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>TL:DR;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I think that ultimately, issues pertinent to the community need to have meaningful, two way, sustained engagement with the community. I'd like to see participation from more \"regular\" community members as well who will add necessary and valuable perspectives to understand our community better and help improve it.</p><p>I believe there is a need for two different spaces - one for leaders to coordinate with each other, and one for a dialogue to be had. But I think the latter is essential to informing the agenda of the former. I'd love for the community survey to be a first step towards creating that second space. Perhaps something like what I\u2019m describing could even be the kind of thing that\u2019s discussed during the Forum.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>To elaborate:&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Often I think the term \u201cEA community\u201d or \u201ccommunity building\u201d can be used to mean different things. I think there\u2019s a difference between efforts towards \u201cEA the movement\u201d vs those (perhaps more internally facing) \u201cEA the community. For example, funding a new organization to target policy professionals for AI governance would \u201cEA the movement\u201d decision (even though it\u2019s&nbsp;<i>community&nbsp;</i>building), while improving sexual misconduct practices would be \u201cEA the community\u201d.&nbsp;</p><p>From the post, I understand that the forum\u2019s remit is both \u201cmovement\u201d and \u201ccommunity\u201d(emphasis mine):</p><blockquote><p>only focused on the<strong> \u201cmeta\u201d/community-building</strong> space rather than object-level decisions in any cause area.</p></blockquote><p>and is&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>aimed at improving the trajectories of EA and related&nbsp;<strong>communities</strong>\u201d</p></blockquote><p>They are of course very intertwined, and from the events of the past year it is likely that community concerns will be an important topic of conversation.&nbsp;</p><p>For such issues, I think it\u2019s essential for there to be meaningful dialogue between (regular, representative) community members and EA decision-makers and leaders, and more mechanisms by which community members can systematically raise concerns that are directly relevant to them (e.g. a place to see current issues, how much support there is for addressing those issues, potential solutions being considered &amp; worked on, etc.)&nbsp;</p><p>I think that in any community, leaders will likely not always be aware of what is happening \"on-the-ground\", and that there are many systemic, power-differential related reasons that they won\u2019t always be getting the information they need. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if this has improved post-FTX, but I\u2019m pretty sure we have a ways to go in this regard.</p><p>Up until now, leaders haven\u2019t prioritized this very highly (even if they believe it's important). I think this is because there has historically been a lack of clarity as to whose responsibility managing the community is. The community itself has grown faster than the community infrastructure could keep up.</p><p>I don\u2019t think setting up the infrastructure to allow for this dialogue to occur is trivial or easy. It's costly to do well. It requires investment from leaders and others who would work on these issues full time. The work is (often emotionally) hard, unrewarding, and sometimes it\u2019s not clear if you\u2019ve had an impact. That being said, I believe it is essential infrastructure to make this community sustainable and health (and allow it to grow).&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "vaidehi_agarwalla"}}, {"_id": "xbgcDsuE83aoqs79q", "postedAt": "2023-09-10T21:03:05.645Z", "postId": "33o5jbe3WjPriGyAR", "htmlBody": "<p>\"After the event, we plan to publish a summary of the survey responses.\"</p>", "parentCommentId": "TJHJpDNHrE4uYF4cn", "user": {"username": "David Mears"}}, {"_id": "HubnPstzi8LrvP7Zz", "postedAt": "2023-09-10T22:55:44.132Z", "postId": "33o5jbe3WjPriGyAR", "htmlBody": "<p>Ah yes thanks!

This zeitgeist is&nbsp;<i>not</i> captured in larger EA discourse, from the Forum to conversations I have with non-MEARO community leaders. And this MERAO zeitgeist is evolving rapidly, such that it looks very different from even four months ago. As a result, I don\u2019t think anyone who hasn\u2019t been intimately involved in MEAROs in the past 3-6 months can represent our general shared perspective.</p><p>This shared perspective is born out of three main ingredients:</p><ol><li><strong>\u201cOn the ground\u201d intensive feedback loops:</strong> We are engaging directly with community members at all stages of the funnel\u2014across EA causes and professions\u2014understanding their concerns, aspirations, and challenges in real time. This provides a richness of information on everything from how people are finding EA, to reactions to current events, to what HEAs see as their biggest needs from community builders. Think of us as carrying out unofficial and constant surveying on everything you\u2019d want the broader EA community\u2019s feedback on.</li><li><strong>High-level EA org feedback:</strong> EA orgs and projects from throughout the ecosystem consistently correspond and collaborate with MEAROs in a way that provides us with a decently holistic and up-to-date understanding of where EA is and where it is headed.</li><li><strong>MEARO-level strategy:&nbsp;</strong>It is our job to think about what MEAROs are and what they should be to achieve maximum impact. We arguably have the most mental bandwidth for this task of anyone in EA and, again, this is shifting dramatically as the EA community and the causes we care about rapidly change.</li></ol><p>I think segments of #1 and #3 are captured by some of the publicly listed attendees, and I imagine the attendees have an equally good or even substantially better experience of #2, but it is the unique perspective that the combination of the three enables that I\u2019m referencing.</p><p>At an event focused on meta coordination, it seems really important to have the perspective of those engaging constantly and deeply with \u201cthe EA masses,\u201d immersed in regional strategy, and among the best able to shape the future of EA perception as the on-the-ground representatives of EA to thousands of people worldwide.</p><p>I talked this through with <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/james-herbert-1?mention=user\">@James Herbert</a> a bit and we discussed three possible cruxes here:</p><ol><li>Are the people in the public attendee list doing different work from MEARO leaders?<ol><li>For example, have they directly done things listed in <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/33o5jbe3WjPriGyAR/announcing-the-meta-coordination-forum-2023?commentId=SLXDnf9KzNusvGtRu\">Patrick's comment</a>, or advised hundreds of regular people in their geographic region?</li></ol></li><li>If they have, how long is that knowledge valid?<ol><li>For example, EA looks very different in September 2023 than it did in September 2022, and that changes the nature of some aspects of MEARO leadership more than others.</li></ol></li><li>Does directly doing the type of work involved in operating a MEARO give you a different set of knowledge that is useful in contexts like the Mera Coordination Forum?<ol><li>I hope the above gestures at why I think the answer is \"yes\" and believe most other MEARO leaders are likely to agree.</li></ol></li></ol><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnqzfo1rq60b\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefqzfo1rq60b\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Yes, I totally just coined this acronym.</p></div></li></ol>", "parentCommentId": "x5nF47Qzxr5CFjEju", "user": {"username": "Rockwell Schwartz"}}, {"_id": "WDp74dk3LMBsgnFHz", "postedAt": "2023-09-12T17:45:30.419Z", "postId": "33o5jbe3WjPriGyAR", "htmlBody": "<p>Thank you, Michel!
