I'm familiar with the animation on YouTube content creators such as MinutePhysics, ASAP Science, Thought Bubble, and Kurz Gegast. I think animated videos can express better abstract and heavily technical details, which would work well with spreading effective altruism virally. Kurz Gegast and Thought Bubble are both businesses which might be available for hire. I expect hiring them might be too expensive, but I'll check it out. Even if they're affordable, a cost-benefit analysis might not yield confidence it's worth the investment. Julia Galef uses some program to help generate illustrations for her YouTube series on rationality for cheaper, but they're not as high-quality.</p>\n<p>Otherwise, video content could just be produced by people giving presentations. I think just talking at a screen in a monotone voice wouldn't work. Presentations like the TEDx ones effective altruists have presented in the past work well, but access to a conference-style presentation isn't usually available. I think shorter videos that explain individual ideas are better for sharing and spreading than hour-long lectures on video. Others feel free to make suggestions for other video content to inspire video content made for effective altruism.</p>\n<p>I'm willing to get in front of a camera and talk, but I don't know if that will be enough.
