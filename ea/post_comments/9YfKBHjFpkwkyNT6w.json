From beginning to end, the main thing a Rebel needs to do as an active, contributing member is to show up to civil disobedience actions. While this requires personal risk and planning, it\u2019s significantly more straightforward and well-defined than what Core EA members would usually go through. Even&nbsp;<i>\u201cbeginner\u201d</i> EAs have to read incredibly lengthy introductions to EA. Of course, one could correctly point out that EA has significantly higher standards for epistemic rigour and sustained long-term contribution. As you note in your earlier posts in the sequence, more steps requiring more guidance/support/ feedback/expertise, drifts towards more centralisation.</li><li><strong>The second difference is different demands for core members.</strong> One thing that fascinates me ever since I&nbsp;<i>\u201ctransitioned\u201d</i> from climate movement to EA movement is how, justice sensitivity and expansive altruism aside, the two select for completely different traits. EA essentially wants highly-engaged members to do one of two things: contribute by working in EA long-term (research, operations etc.), or donating, which also skews long-term. These behaviours generally fit into a \u201c<i>normal</i>\u201d leadership hierarchy. Climate/social cause movements, meanwhile, are generally dealing with well-defined and contentious issues, where the theory of change relies on public shows of mass support. The most highly engaged members may take on high risk of social/legal/physical repercussions, and participation correlates with risk tolerance and disagreeableness. While participation does rely on strong ties,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref44jo9jgw4av\"><sup><a href=\"#fn44jo9jgw4av\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;the selection pressure is practically polar opposite. Rebels are more inclined follow those willing to face prison for the cause,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsuzw4m8fewo\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsuzw4m8fewo\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;while EAs select for&nbsp;<i>\u201cpotential for impact\u201d</i>, which correlates with proxies that are high-status and suitable for hierarchies (degree qualification, technical skill, references from other EAs).<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6w8dms4482y\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6w8dms4482y\">[3]</a></sup></span></li></ol><p>Anyway, I just discovered your sequence and theories of change. I agree and have had similar thoughts for quite a while. As someone who researched member-organised movement and tried to build one as a contingency for the co-founders\u2019 imprisonment, I\u2019d say a member-organised structure is difficult for EA to adopt.</p><p>That said, I\u2019m a very vocal supporter of EAs learning best practices from others. The climate movement that turned climate risk from a niche x-risk into the largest mobilisation of people, capital and resources in human history, and I regularly apply its lessons to planning EA meta/longtermism projects.
