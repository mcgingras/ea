In future, they plan to \u201caddress the very principles of governance, ensure that all significant causes of intense suffering receive adequate attention, and promote strategies to prevent locked-in totalitarianism\u201d. One concrete project within this is a full length film to inspire people with this vision and lay out actionable steps.

Yes, I entirely agree, assuming of course that this epistemology encompasses subjective experience. In other places I consistently refer to the combination of compassion and rationality as core values. In fact, one could argue that compassion is a consequence of rationality if one takes into account the content of all current and potential subjective experiences/mind states as &nbsp;the most relevant part of reality to act upon, and one also takes a metaphysically accurate view of personal identity. In this post I didn't focus on rationality because it is already a strong given within the EA community (although I dispute the rationality of some widely held principles), whereas concern for suffering is more variable.</p>", "parentCommentId": "9rZuN8Yvrgr9uibzn", "user": {"username": "jonleighton"}}]
