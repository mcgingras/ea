This belief is partly based on what I've seen at current charities and partly based on the premise that EAs aren't as special as they can sometimes seem. When you do nonprofit startups, most of the time goes toward ordinary tasks that lots of people could do.</p>\n<p>I enjoy working on nonprofit stuff, so I don't find EtG psychologically more attractive, but after a lot of thinking about this question, I've tentatively concluded that I can make a bigger impact EtGing. I think this would be true even if I could only make ~$150K/year, which is too low as an estimate of long-term future earnings.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Brian_Tomasik"}}, {"_id": "wGbTeokr4e7XLufCF", "postedAt": "2015-05-29T07:20:58.796Z", "postId": "4385HNATyQLg28ztL", "htmlBody": "<p>Animal Charity Evaluators acts like the nexus between all these organizations. The newer ones founded by effective altruists don't have enough of a track record to merit a recommendation from Animal Charity Evaluators yet. However, all these, and ACE's top recommended charities, like Mercy For Animals and the Humane League, are in touch with each other. Nick Cooney, who works for Animal Charity Evaluators, has written a book about effective altruism this year, in addition to the one Peter Singer has written, and recommend each other's books to the public.</p>\n<p>So, yes, they're definitely in touch with each other. One difference between existential risk reduction and animal activism is x-risk is smaller. X-risk reduction is so integrated with effective altruism that I think EA knows about everyone in x-risk reduction, and everyone in x-risk reduction knows about EA. However, animal activism is a much bigger movement than just what's touched by effective altruism. Animal welfare/rights has much overlap with environmentalism, which might be the biggest social movement in the world, stretching even the definition of &quot;movement&quot;, really. The rest of animal activism seems so big it's difficult for effective altruism to take into account the actions of the rest of that community, and EA itself is probably only a small part of animal activism. </p>\n<p>For more information, I recommend contacting a <a href=\"http://www.animalcharityevaluators.org/about/meet-our-team/board-of-directors/\">director from the Board of ACE</a>, such as Rob Wiblin, Brian Tomasik, or Jacy Anthis</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "RbwQxFWpHmxnTptAs", "user": {"username": "Evan_Gaensbauer"}}, {"_id": "4NjDwT83idMmuBEeA", "postedAt": "2015-06-02T15:45:31.796Z", "postId": "4385HNATyQLg28ztL", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks Tom.

It is definitely easier and more beneficial in the short term to evaluate existing charities. It would be really great to see some sort of cost/benefit break down comparing the time and energy it would take to create a new charity vs retrofitting an existing one.</p>\n<p>This seems like a very complex question but I think it may be valuable as a long-term strategy for EAs to look at. Ultimately the goal is to divert enough energy and attention to highly effective charities, which would ultimately mean that other charities notice what donors want. To my mind it would be really fantastic if at that moment there was an EA organization or group that could step in and help organizations look at how to become more effective. Again this seems to be a long way off, but something worth doing an analysis of.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "B3Q6gLGf64LeyNbbe", "user": {"username": "SydMartin"}}, {"_id": "559aTrcWxHXkFzXSp", "postedAt": "2015-06-06T15:31:05.519Z", "postId": "4385HNATyQLg28ztL", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks Carl.
