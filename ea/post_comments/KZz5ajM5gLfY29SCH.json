I guess I meant, which is still true, &quot;there are no models I known how to use&quot;...</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>ix Ways DPR Could Do Good, yet your quantitative model only seems to take into account the first of these, improved treatment for mental health. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I think the mental health effect is the biggest, it's also the easiest to think about because I know what the numbers are - it would take me a long time to assess the happiness impact of DPR caused by reducing crime (how much happiness does a crime remove? how many are there around the world? how many of those are attributable to drugs? etc...). I don't plan to do any further modelling as I need to get back to my thesis and the detail of DPR now looks like it will be outside it. FWIW, I think the mental health impact of DPR is about 80% of it's value, but when I asked Lee the same question (before telling him my view) I think he said it was about 30% (we were potentially using different moral philosophies).</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Does this assume that every single person suffering from depression or anxiety in the UK will adopt the new treatment? </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Yeah, I'm not clear on this. It's probably unreasonable to assume everyone would get/use the new treatment, although that's what I initially thought. I take the 0.1 as the (mean) average change across all those could be treated.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You assume a 0.1 change</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I just guessed the number based on (a) the happiness impact of removing depression via other methods and (b) my qualitative sense from reading the studies of how much more effective psychedelics seems to be than alternatives. If there's a cardinal scale I can use that shows how much better psychedelics are that would be great, but I didn't dig through because doing something like what Lovisa and Konstantin did didn't occur to me.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>with regard to the \u00a3166m figure. It would be useful to get an order of magnitude estimate of the cost of past campaigns</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I agree it would be good to do this. I looked into this a bit but couldn't find anything useful on the cost-effectiveness of lobbying (I skimmed your paper too; it doesn't really bear on the question at hand). It's also a long way from my area of expertise and thought I was better to share what I had rather that wait until I'd found time to dig into this (which may not happen for months). If anyone read this and wanted to have a go, I'd be very grateful.</p>\n<p>FWIW, two more things, 1) I think \u00a3166m figure is conservative and the real figure is closer to \u00a310.5bn. </p>\n<p>2) This is compared to AMF. As I note above and have argued elsewhere, you would have you to hold a particular, implausible philosophical view to believe AMF is as cost-effective as I stated; I was being generous to my imagined critics. A more realistic comparison is probably Basic Needs, which I say above is about 3x less cost-effective than AMF on AMF's unbelievable numbers, So really we should multiply the ammount we would spend on a DPR campaign by three to get something like \u00a3560m (conservative) or \u00a335bn (optimistic).</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "5QgAtvoYYMXJFSTJK", "user": {"username": "MichaelPlant"}}, {"_id": "kGKZFzpTkhQzBj9vb", "postedAt": "2017-08-15T23:25:01.118Z", "postId": "KZz5ajM5gLfY29SCH", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks - very interesting.

Of course there are many reasons why this vision may not pan out, but it does seem like we should have a non-negligible probability that we are alone in the galaxy (or even the visible universe) and that we can and have the will to colonize the stars if we don't destroy ourselves. These qualifiers might only take a few orders of magnitude off. Then even if you do not believe in the tractability of AI, there are many other concrete interventions that could reduce existential risk, like <a href=\"http://users.physics.harvard.edu/~wilson/pmpmta/Mahoney_extinction.pdf\">asteroid defense</a> and <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeding_Everyone_No_Matter_What\">alternate foods</a>. So basically I do not believe the prior of cost effectiveness of global poverty interventions should be strong, so I don't think we should adjust these expected value calculations downward nearly as much as some proposed models have done. </p>\n<p>Also, if one does not value the far future, there are other claims of cost effectiveness <a href=\"http://effective-altruism.com/ea/14y/saving_expected_lives_at_10_apiece/\">better than global poverty</a>.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Denkenberger"}}, {"_id": "oGYYpJJPoYFzKHA5s", "postedAt": "2017-08-16T20:30:07.283Z", "postId": "KZz5ajM5gLfY29SCH", "htmlBody": "<p>Hey Denkenberger, thanks for your comment. I too tend to weight the future heavily and I think there are some reasons to believe that DPR <em>could</em> have nontrivial benefits with this set of preferences. This was in fact why, as Michael mentions above:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>&quot;FWIW, I think the mental health impact of DPR is about 80% of it's value, but when I asked Lee the same question (before telling him my view) I think he said it was about 30% (we were potentially using different moral philosophies).&quot;\nbecause I think DPR's effects on the far future could be the source of most of its expected value. </p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>DPR sits at the juncture between international development &amp; economic growth, global &amp; mental health, national &amp; international crime, terrorism, conflict &amp; security, and human rights. I think we should expect solving the world drug problem to improve some or all of these issues, as Michael argued in the series. </p>\n<p>I think it could be easy to overlook the expected benefits of significant reductions in funding and motivation for crime, corruption, terrorism, and conflict for fostering a stable, trusting global system. My weak conjecture is that such reductions would bring an array of global benefits composed of reduced out-group fear (on community and international levels), stronger institutions, and richer societies. </p>\n<p>DPR might thus offer a step in the right direction towards solving issues of global coordination, which in turn may increase our expectations for solving the coordination problem for AI and, thence, the long-term future. I admit this is a fairly hand-wavy notion and that the causal chains are undesirably long and uncertain, relying on unpredictable assumptions (such as the timing of an intelligence takeoff compared with the length of time it would take to observe the international social benefits, for a start). My confidence intervals are therefore commensurately wide, but still I struggle to think of ways in which it could be net negative for global coordination. So almost all of my probability weight is positive. Multiplied by humanity's cosmic endowment, I weigh this relatively heavily. Of course, there may be other, more certain activities that we can do to improve the EV of humanity's future, and I think there are, but I don't think DPR is obviously a waste of time if that's what we care about. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "kGKZFzpTkhQzBj9vb", "user": {"username": "Lee_Sharkey"}}, {"_id": "w9iTSBCFw9jpgdg8i", "postedAt": "2017-08-21T21:44:28.731Z", "postId": "KZz5ajM5gLfY29SCH", "htmlBody": "<p>This is a very impressive series.
