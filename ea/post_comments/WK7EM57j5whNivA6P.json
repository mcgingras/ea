I know it's extremely inefficient, and believe me, you're not the only one bearing the burden of the costs. However, it's not a good idea to contact people right now for any career advice or networking unless it's a 1-on-1 meeting and there's proof of identity. Once EAforum goes back to normal, the chilling effect will stop and we'll be able to exchange information the normal way.</p><p>For now, I recommend going to <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/speak-with-us/\">80k's career advisors</a>. It is entirely free and by far the best place to go.</p><p>Please do not exchange information with any anonymous people unless you can verify their identity e.g. via a linkedin page.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Stone"}}, {"_id": "W5DeJLiftE7ZcMQ9c", "postedAt": "2023-01-13T20:34:42.068Z", "postId": "WK7EM57j5whNivA6P", "htmlBody": "<p>Email me at the address <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/authors/dylan-matthews\">here</a>, I'm also based in DC and would love to talk.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Dylan Matthews"}}, {"_id": "Men2qYe3FaawTCPnt", "postedAt": "2023-01-13T20:46:14.979Z", "postId": "WK7EM57j5whNivA6P", "htmlBody": "<p>Forum dev here. ...I have no idea what you're talking about?
