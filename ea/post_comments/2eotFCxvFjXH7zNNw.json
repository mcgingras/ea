I also agree that it's really hard to interpret some of the anecdotes in the TIME article without more context. But I don't agree with this:</p><blockquote><p>I\u2019m&nbsp;<i>not</i> saying that EA is perfect or that nothing in the article is true, but rather that reading it, my gut instinct was that roughly 80% was entirely misleading</p></blockquote><p>I think we have good reason to believe the article is broadly right, even if some of the specific anecdotes don't do a good job of proving this. Here's a rough summary of the main (non-anecdote) points of the article:</p><ol><li>EA involves many \"complex professional relationships\" (true)</li><li>\"Most of the access to funding and opportunities within the movement [is] controlled by men\" (true)</li><li>\"Effective altruism\u2019s overwhelming maleness, its professional incestuousness, its subculture of polyamory and its overlap with tech-bro dominated 'rationalist' groups have combined to create an environment in which sexual misconduct can be tolerated, excused, or rationalized away.\" This language is inflammatory (\"overwhelming\", \"incestuous\"), but we can boil this down to a more sterile sounding claim: \"EA is very male and there is a complex mixing of professional and personal relationships, partly because there are many polyamorous people in the EA/rationalist communities; this creates an environment in which sexual misconduct may be addressed suboptimally.\" This strikes me as totally plausible.</li><li>\"Several women say that the way their allegations were received by the broader EA community was as upsetting as the original misconduct itself. 'The playbook of these EAs is to discourage victims to seek any form of objective, third-party justice possible.'\" This is an ambiguous one: the Community Health Team <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/NbkxLDECvdGuB95gW/the-community-health-team-s-work-on-interpersonal-harm-in\">explicitly says otherwise</a> (\"if a crime happened, we think the victim should consider going to the police\"), but <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/2zr2WbwfexBJSBunN/poorly-considered-throwaway-statements-harm-the-reputation\">boy</a><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xrmM6zWco9QEMxG6j/ways-in-which-ea-could-fail#Reputation_failures\"> is</a> <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/KfqFLDkoccf8NQsQe/potential-downsides-of-using-explicit-probabilities\">there</a> <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/maWneZjzQpigAFKPZ/ea-should-spend-its-funding-overhang-on-curing-infectious\">a </a><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/av7MiEhi983SjoXTe/some-core-assumptions-of-effective-altruism-according-to-me\">lot</a> of discussion within EA about the importance of protecting EA's reputation, so someone might understandably feel pressure not to go to the police, even if no one ever told them not to.</li><li>\"The movement\u2019s high-minded goals can create a moral shield, they say, allowing members to present themselves as altruists committed to saving humanity regardless of how they treat the people around them.\" (seems fair)</li><li>\"The hard question for the Effective Altruism community is whether the case of the EA house in San Francisco is an isolated incident, with failures specific to the area and those involved, or whether it is an exemplar of a larger problem for the movement.\" (I think people agree with this)</li><li>\"That balancing of interests is a starkly different approach than the one espoused by the #MeToo\" (true)</li><li>\"#MeToo urged society to 'believe women;' EAs tend to be a bit more skeptical.\" (also seems true)</li><li>\"EA\u2019s polyamorous subculture was a key reason why the community had become a hostile environment for women.\" To be clear, I think this article is bigoted about polyamory, and I agree with <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JCyX29F77Jak5gbwq/?commentId=cDnhvShDFhPfFBEpJ\">this</a>. But it's plausible that the polyamorous subculture contributes a hostile environment for women, <i>if only </i>because it is combined with a 2:1 male:female ratio and high tolerance for people hitting on each other in EA spaces. In general, the fact that a lot of people are polyamorous would seem to have two important implications: 1) more people are open to dating other people and 2) casually mentioning that you're in a relationship is less likely to signal to someone that they shouldn't hit on you. &nbsp;As a result of all of these things (not just the polyamorous subculture), women who don't want to be hit on at EA events may have a set of relatively suboptimal options\u2014being hit on, or saying \"please stop hitting on me\". There are also upsides to the polyamorous subculture, including for women, but if there are more women in the \"I don't want to be hit on at this event\" camp than not, &nbsp;it's conceivable that the net effect is bad for women.</li></ol><p>Importantly, these kinds of claims are hard to substantiate with stories: I mean, how do you prove that the combination of gender imbalance in EA, men having disproportionate power in EA, mixture of professional and personal relationships, and polyamorous subculture have created an environment in which sexual misconduct is not addressed optimally? You suggest:</p><blockquote><p>The default orientation to this should be \"Let's carefully evaluate each claim by the evidence we have for it, and assess the context of those claims\", instead of an automatic \"believe and support every claim in this article, both the facts and the narrative the writer is trying to use those facts for.\"</p></blockquote><p>And sure; we should evaluate evidence critically. My impression was that people did basically adopt this orientation, at least as was evidenced in the comments section <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JCyX29F77Jak5gbwq/ea-sexual-harassment-and-abuse\">here</a>.</p><p>But it's just hard to present evidence that conclusively proves the very reasonable\u2014if possibly incorrect\u2014hypothesis put forward by both the reporter and interviewees. In addition, &nbsp;this is <a href=\"https://nonprofitchronicles.com/2019/04/02/the-peculiar-metoo-story-of-animal-activist-jacy-reese/\">not the first time</a> these kinds of allegations have been made, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/JCyX29F77Jak5gbwq/?commentId=gFi5roZeJBp9xu2PY\">other women</a> have since said they've grappled with gender issues, and the article includes unambiguously bad anecdotes (\"an influential figure in EA whose role included picking out promising students and funneling them towards highly coveted jobs... arranged for her to be flown to the U.K. for a job interview. [She was] surprised to discover that she was expected to stay in his home, not a hotel. When she arrived, she says, 'he told me he needed to masturbate before seeing me').</p><p>In sum, I think we have good reason to think that the article is broadly true, even if some of the specific stories leave a lot of questions unanswered. And I'm glad the Community Health Team is trying to <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/mEkRrDweNSdNdrmvx/plans-for-investigating-and-improving-the-experience-of\">answer those questions</a>.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "hobbes"}}, {"_id": "a3w4kr2bphbikZChX", "postedAt": "2023-02-18T15:50:05.611Z", "postId": "2eotFCxvFjXH7zNNw", "htmlBody": "<p>As an initial matter, there any evidence that Ms. Joseph \"[went] to TIME to use this guy as evidence that EA has a sexual assault problem\"?

I also think this kind of claim is hard to prove\u2014it's just difficult to establish causation between one amorphous cultural phenomenon and another. Given that, I think the article does a good job of showing that women EAs in the Bay Area were repeatedly made uncomfortable by men's behavior towards them. Without more context, it's hard to know how much to condemn the men here (e.g., were people making innocent mistakes, or was this more malicious?), but clearly a lot of women felt bad about the encounters they had. I don't think we have reason to doubt this, and I think this is something the EA community should reflect on and investigate further.&nbsp;</p><p>There's also a separate, stronger claim that the article seems to be gesturing at, which is maybe closer to: &nbsp;\"rates of sexual harassment and assault are higher in the EA community than elsewhere, at least in the Bay Area.\" And I agree with you that the article hasn't really provided much evidence for this (beyond that one extremely troubling anecdote), although I think we have some independent reasons to worry about this.

It often referred to incidents that could have been terrible, or could have been fine. It just didn't give us enough data to decide for ourselves. Instead it expected us to assume the most terrible version of the story was true. It means that we need to look carefully at our community to figure out whether we are doing worse than other communities, but it is not by itself proof of that.</p><p>When you are a victim of long term sexual abuse, you initially have a very poor understanding of appropriate gender relations. I've worked hard to develop normal expectations, and the doctor I've been seeing for the PTSD believes I would be successful in future relationships because my expectations are essentially those of a person who has not been a victim of sexual abuse. I feel the public response of EA has previously usually been to assume the worst possible scenarios in the Time article's examples happened. This has made me worry that I'm practically the only one with this response to the article, which would likely mean my doctor is wrong and my understanding of appropriate gender relations is still too poor to resume dating. If you hadn't posted this and the post hadn't gotten so much support, I would still be doubting myself inappropriately and putting off dating for this reason.</p><p>The world is a complicated place that our models are often wrong about. People have been critical of this kind of take because they believe it harms sexual abuse survivors, but my experience has been different. There are likely all sorts of examples like this in every situation where epistemic integrity must be balanced against being sensitive to the needs of people who have experienced terrible things.

If 5 people out of 50 in one's clan report seriously negative interactions with person X, that's a pretty high hit rate of grievances.</p><p>However, in modern partisan social media culture, where someone can have many thousands or millions of followers, including hundreds to thousands of ideologically motivated hostile critics, this heuristic breaks down.

It becomes easy to find not just 5 people who hate person X, but 50, or 500 -- and our Pleistocene social brains interpret that as dispositive evidence that the person X must be worthy of hatred.</p><p>Then it becomes easy for journalists, bloggers, or random social media obsessives to compile all this negativity into a carefully curated grievance-bundle &nbsp;that makes someone -- or some group, organization, subculture, or movement-- sound very bad indeed.&nbsp;</p><p>Naive readers exposed to such grievance-bundles will see several examples of smoke, and conclude that there must have been some underlying fire.&nbsp;</p><p>My hypothesis -- which is speculative, and untested, but, I hope, plausible -- is that our evolved social-judgment heuristics are just not very scope-sensitive about social information when we're judging the reputations or moral virtues/vices of people and groups. At least, not scope-sensitive enough to be very accurate when we're judging reputations in the modern world of social media, which includes literally millions of very unhappy, hateful, resentful, and/or delusional trolls who spend a LOT of time, energy, and dark creativity trying to bring others down.</p><p>A secondary effect of this 'social-reputation scope-insensitivity' is that when the trolls see other trolls complaining about a particular person or group, their own social judgments get confirmed, through a combination of social proof, confirmation bias, and motivated reasoning. If they were alone with their negativity, they might doubt their judgment. But it is always easy, on social media, among millions of others, to find dozens to hundreds of others who share their negative views -- which validates their initial judgment, and makes their grievance seem righteous and worth sharing even more widely. &nbsp;This can lead to a runaway effect, where once a critical mass of negative judgment coalesces around a person or group, more and more people dogpile onto the target.&nbsp;</p><p>This seems to have been happening a lot to Aella as an individual. It's also been happening a lot to EA as a movement in the last few months. It is the social-psychological heart of cancel culture.

For instance, when I was in high school, other kids spread some really wild rumours about me, including that I had gotten in a fistfight with my English teacher and got away with it (without even getting detention), or that I cheated on all my tests. I did judo outside of school, and other kids apparently found that implausible enough that the majority of my school peers believed I was making it up and couldn't possibly <em>actually</em> do judo. I think this rumour got started just because I was pretty bad at the sports we played in school, like netball and hockey, so people told each other I was clearly lying about being good at judo.</p>\n<p>When I was like twelve I identified as asexual, and I remember a group telling me that they'd heard I just <em>pretended</em> to be asexual in order to cover up being a sex addict. As far as I can tell, this just happened because other kids didn't think twelve was old enough to know my identity was asexual (and apparently they found the sex addict thing more plausible somehow). I assure you I was not famous, neither was that rumour true (I was <em>twelve</em>).</p>\n<p>I really don't have a good model of why that happens. Being famous will definitely increase the amount that false things are said about someone, but being autistic seems to cause lots of this too. Being unusual or weird in many ways makes it easy to misrepresent you, since the truth can feel less plausible than the fiction. This happens a <em>lot</em> to me in social contexts where I'm very weird, and a lot less in social contexts where I fit in better.</p>\n<p>But also, we have to be very careful about how we extrapolate these anecdotes to sexual ethics. As an adult, someone tried to spread the rumour that I was deeply in debt and lost my job for financial crimes (I've never taken out a substantial loan in my life, let alone not paid it back, and I've certainly never committed any major financial crimes). I know why they did it (I refused to sell them something that they wanted after a long and frustrating negotiation) and I also know that nothing bad happened to them due to spreading this untrue rumour, and there was no cost to doing so. It makes sense as to why they'd lie. Similarly, when people lied about me fistfighting my English teacher, there was basically no drawbacks; at worst somebody might decide that they're an unreliable source of juicy gossip. There's no reason <em>not</em> to repeat a funny or exciting rumour if you just want to be a popular kid. I think that's a very very different thing from when a woman comes forward with a personal firsthand allegation of sexual misconduct against a man in a position of power, since often she faces massive harassment and professional consequences for doing so. I think that means that those kinds of allegations are much less likely to be lies, and definitely much less likely to be passed around as the \"fun\" kind of gossip.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "fGhK5n7dJMWyWLFvB", "user": {"username": "firinn"}}, {"_id": "RoD3PziPHkSd4Q8ey", "postedAt": "2023-02-19T15:47:19.361Z", "postId": "2eotFCxvFjXH7zNNw", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>I also don\u2019t want to turn this into \u201cand now Aella hijacks this issue to talk about personal social drama where she picks through the details of every rumor in order to convince you she\u2019s not a terrible person\u201d.

I remember watching a video from \"Ms. Joseph\" and she just wanted the problems handled, I thought so anyway. She didn't seem to care about\"public attention\". So it seems very important to clarify that if you or anyone else just wants a problem handled, that going to the press may be one of the worst ways to get that done. After all, a journalist can't even answer  questions and ever help you understand what went wrong.
