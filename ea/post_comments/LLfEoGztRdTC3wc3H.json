During undergrad years prior to SoGive, I was &nbsp;an RA for an academic research lab at my Uni (sciences), had a campus job as a tour guide, held a leadership position with my student co-op, and did a data science internship. &nbsp;<br><br>Critically, the things I benefitted from most while volunteering with SoGive were things my other roles didn't provide. I think specializing in EA research too early probably isn't a great longterm career move, and diversifying your extracurriculars to get a healthy mixture of community, fun, and targeted skill/career capital building is really important for both well-being and intellectual growth. Because my university had strong research programs for undergraduates, academic labs were probably a more direct way of \"testing my fit\" for research, but I expect this won't be the case for most students. This work was a good fit for me as an undergraduate, but especially so because it met criteria others didn't and provided mentorship from someone I respect (Sanjay).<br><br>TLDR; &nbsp; I'd encourage interested students to check out this program and listen to Alex Lawsen's 80k episode on advice for students.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "violet"}}]
