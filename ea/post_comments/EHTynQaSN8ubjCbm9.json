I'm less sure as to whether many of these interventions clear the <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/technical-updates-to-our-global-health-and-wellbeing-cause-prioritization-framework/#45-bottom-line\">1,000x bar</a> though, which (naively replacing US VSL = $7 mil with AMF's ~$5k) seems to imply 1% reduction for &lt; $1 billion. (I recall <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cKPkimztzKoCkZ75r/how-many-ea-2021-usds-would-you-trade-off-against-a-0-01?commentId=ooEuFiZKQwwacb7MJ\">Linch's comment</a> being bullish and comfortable on interventions reducing x-risk ~0.01% at ~$100 mil, which could either be interpreted as ~100x i.e. in the ballpark of GiveDirectly's cash transfers, or as aggregating over a longer timescale than by 2050; the latter is probably the case. The other comments to that post offer a pretty wide range of values.)&nbsp;</p><p>That said, I've never actually seen a BOTEC justifying an actual x-risk grant (vs e.g. Open Phil's <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GsE2_TNWn0x6MWL1PTdkZT2vQNFW8VFBslC5qjk4sgo/edit\">sample BOTECs</a> for various grants with confidential details redacted), so my remarks above seem mostly immaterial to how x-risk cost-effectiveness estimates inform grant allocations in practice. I'd love to see some real examples.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Mo Nastri"}}]
