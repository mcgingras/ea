I find it amusing that I discovered EA shortly after getting accepted into medical school, since doctors have often come up as the prototypical example for being counter-intuitively ineffective. I don't think this is unrelated to the lack of fulfillment and jadedness that many doctors eventually come to experience, and I've since been consumed by the desire to find a promising way to avoid this trap. I think EA offers a compelling perspective, one which gives me inspiring and explicit suggestions for directing my time and resources.</p>\n<p>At my school, we're required to conduct an independent research project on any medically-related topic of our choosing by the time we graduate. I've decided to use this as an opportunity to delve deeper into EA as it relates to my future career as a physician, and ideally, to form connections with individuals who can help me towards my altruistic goals in the future. Some topics I've considered include examining the ways that physicians make a difference other than earning to give, identifying the different metrics by which to measure a physician's impact, and interviewing specific physicians who accomplish impactful goals. As you've probably already noticed, these topics are extremely broad, and I was hoping that members here might offer suggestions for specific research questions that I could investigate - ideally something that is as of yet under or unexplored. While I've read many great suggestions on how to navigate careers, I'm interested in learning more about how this applies to the practicing physician. I would also be interested to hear from/about doctors who have chartered their own unique path towards making a difference, challenging the typical template for what a medical doctor looks like.

It relates to our need as a global community to address human population growth by tasking every nation with the responsibility to stabilize their population at a sustainable level.</p>\n<p>Feedback is welcome and appreciated. Thank you.</p>\n<p>THE PITCH</p>\n<p>Goal\nTo catalyze an international campaign that leads to the UN establishing a Framework Convention on Population Growth. Further, the goal I have in mind is to present a joint international position statement with signatory organizations and/or individuals representing countries from every inhabited continent to the UN in 2018 prior to COP24 and UNEA-4.</p>\n<p>Note: I would like to attend the 2018 meeting of the UN's Commission on Population and Development in April and am seeking fellow supporters to join me.</p>\n<p>Context\nSeveral environment-related international treaties exist today, yet none of them address the root cause of our oversized demands on the planet: human overpopulation. Every country deserves a voice at the table and this would provide them that opportunity.</p>\n<p>We as a global community can't view the UN's population growth projections as destiny -- 9.8 billion people in the year 2050 should be viewed as wholly unacceptable if we're keeping future generations and other species as well as our own livelihoods in mind. The earth simply can't support this. We are choosing short-term aggregate economic growth over long-term environmental, economic, political, social, and cultural stability, putting the future habitability of the entire planet in jeopardy. We know this is true and such knowledge demands action.</p>\n<p>My thought is, if we can get human overpopulation + continued growth to be formally recognized by the UN as a global issue that must be addressed via national population policies (like the NDCs for the Paris Agreement), then people around the world will become more amenable to openly discussing local population matters, such as unintended pregnancy rates, sexuality education programs, access to family planning information and services, and migration, as well as foreign aid and economic justice.</p>\n<p>Vision\nMy vision for the UN treaty is that it would formally recognize existing human overpopulation + continued growth -- within the context of the IPAT formula -- as a significant environmental issue and existential threat to the survival of humanity (one of several, to be sure). It would also promote a 3-pronged solution at national and international levels to achieve the goal of sustainable populations in every country.</p>\n<p>3-pronged solution\n(1) Emphasize education about the issue of existing human overpopulation + continued growth, including why it poses an existential threat and why embracing small families to achieve a global TFR below 2.0 for the foreseeable future is an essential component of the solution.\n(2) Prioritize the &quot;ease of access&quot; model of fertility decline, which appears to fit every country's situation and addresses the goals of rapid fertility decline followed by sustained sub-replacement fertility rates by way of freedom to make informed family size choices, not coercion.\n(3) Promote smaller &quot;normal&quot; family sizes -- we need to establish a new normal for the Anthropocene.</p>\n<p>Underlying this 3-pronged solution are the 5 principles presented in a paper written by Population Matters Director Robin Maynard. The 5 principles are (1) Universality, (2) Proportionality, (3) Equity, (4) Equality, and (5) Choice. [<a href=\"http://robinmaynard.com/portfolio/population-matters/]\">http://robinmaynard.com/portfolio/population-matters/]</a></p>\n<p>For solution (2) above, the keynote address by Martha Campbell from Population &amp; Sustainability Network's first annual meeting in 2005 provides helpful context.</p>\n<p>For all 3 elements of the solution, Population Media Center President Bill Ryerson's essay from the 2010 Post Carbon Reader Series provides excellent context. [<a href=\"http://mahb.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2010_Ryerson_TheMultiplierofEverythingElse_PostCarbonReaderSeries.pdf]\">http://mahb.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2010_Ryerson_TheMultiplierofEverythingElse_PostCarbonReaderSeries.pdf]</a></p>\n<p>Top reasons for pursuing a treaty through the UN\n(1) To tell the story, the &quot;whole truth&quot; about human overpopulation</p>\n<p>Great opportunity to tell the human overpopulation story, to share the story with a global audience including world leaders and members of the general public, and to publicly and formally assert that human overpopulation is solvable by embracing small families* for the foreseeable future.</p>\n<p>(2) To bring the term &quot;overpopulation&quot; and the existing reality of human overpopulation into the mainstream</p>\n<p>The UN is recognized globally as a lawful, mainstream international governing body. Formal UN recognition of existing human overpopulation and the solution of embracing small families* could help legitimize the issue and the solution in the eyes of world leaders as well as members of the general public.</p>\n<p>(3) To make national population policies necessary and politically expedient</p>\n<p>The Paris Agreement has helped apply pressure on governments and the private sector to &quot;act on climate change&quot;. Efforts to date have been somewhat misguided since they are focused on &quot;downstream&quot; issues, and that's precisely why our cause could benefit from having a similar international accord -- hopefully one that is universally ratified -- that prioritizes action specifically on human overpopulation and highlights the clear, compassionate solution: embracing small families*. As our colleague Karen Shragg likes to say, if we don't act on overpopulation then all of our other efforts will never be enough.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It's worth noting that I don't believe this treaty should be overly prescriptive about particular family sizes. I'm including a &quot;1 child, on average&quot; clarification to describe what constitutes a small family as an unofficial, prudent guideline given the depth of overshoot we're already in. While I'm envisioning this as a non legally binding international accord, it seems like it's high time that we explicitly encourage those family size decisions that will most benefit our shared cause within a reasonable time horizon given the other existential threats we currently face. The &quot;1 child, on average&quot; clarification takes into account the (at least narrowly) accepted notion that 0 children is fine, 1 child is good, and 2 children is enough.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Language\nThe specific language used in the treaty (and even preliminary documents as the campaign grows) will likely make or break this initiative. Population size and growth are understandably sensitive issues, and to ignore this is likely to accept failure. Fortunately, I don't have any deep ties to particular terms (e.g. overpopulation) and have no issue challenging those that do. I want big results (as we all do), and the language that will best allow us to get there with a mutual understanding among all member states is the language we should use. Winning some &quot;battles&quot; should not be misinterpreted as winning the &quot;war&quot;. Winning the &quot;war&quot; is the focus of this initiative, which I believe will be achieved by breaking the mainstream silence on human overpopulation and the resultant overshoot compassionately.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "rdharding2"}}, {"_id": "gxTPniYMpbLj7aSfv", "postedAt": "2017-12-04T19:45:47.511Z", "postId": "4E7f9eNbe4dMbnsme", "htmlBody": "<p>Is there an Effective Altruism wiki?

The debate is hosted on an open source collective intelligence software resulting from a research project funded by the European Commission, technologically supported by MIT. It\u2019s based on research on collective intelligence, going from open and exploratory questions to more in-depth discussions. Right now, we are in the \u201cIdeation\u201d phase, which is very open. You can make constructive answers and debate with other people who are also interested in crafting AI Policies with instant translation.</p>\n<p>The platform is like an online forum articulated around several issues, both short-term and long-term oriented. You have six themes, including \u201cAI Safety and Security\u201d, \u201cReinvent Man &amp; Machine Relationship\u201d and \u201cGovernance Framework\u201d. </p>\n<p>So far, most of the answers have been very constructive. But with you guys\u2026 it can be even better.</p>\n<p>Because you are EAs, I really wanted to pick your brains!</p>\n<p>It would be great if you guys could participate, on the topic you\u2019re most interested in, knowing that a) it will be impactful b) you will be able to challenge your thoughts with other people passionate about AI social impacts. Of course, you don\u2019t have to talk about AI safety if you\u2019d rather focus on other topics.</p>\n<p>Also, the more EAs, the merrier. Or rather, the more impactful! </p>\n<p>So please connect on the debate, and participate!!</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://assembl-civic.bluenove.com/ai-consultation/debate/thread\">Debate is here</a></p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "CarolineJ"}}, {"_id": "LTbpDRZ8phMm3HR5v", "postedAt": "2018-01-06T18:27:29.195Z", "postId": "4E7f9eNbe4dMbnsme", "htmlBody": "<p>Hey all.

What arteries are to the human body, roads are to a continent. The arteries transport all the different nutrients and elements that are required by the human body to all its different locations; similarly roads transport all the various goods of a continent to where they are needed.</p>\n<p>If the road systems are in poor shape, so is the economy; as a result there is poverty. Roads in africa, for example, are often so bad that it takes hours just to drive a few kilometers. A good road system, however, widens the markets; trade can develop, which again spurs motivation, specialisation, innovation and ultimately living standards.</p>\n<p>As a result I have been looking for organisations that are dedicated at least to some extent to the set up of good road systems in poor regions.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Relevant links:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://12.000.scripts.mit.edu/mission2014/solutions/roads-in-sub-saharan-africa\">12.000.scripts.mit.edu/mission2014/solutions/roads-in-sub-saharan-africa</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Role-Transportation-Industrial-Revolution-Comparison/dp/B01K94GVWM/\">amazon.com/Role-Transportation-Industrial-Revolution-Comparison/dp/B01K94GVWM/</a> (the review at the bottom of the page gives a good summary)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://csr21.org/content/reporting-west-africa-where-are-road-building-ngos\">csr21.org/content/reporting-west-africa-where-are-road-building-ngos</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "walter1980"}}, {"_id": "44B7zTbHeZXHtnBBc", "postedAt": "2018-02-07T23:00:59.924Z", "postId": "4E7f9eNbe4dMbnsme", "htmlBody": "<p>very neglected climate cause\n(an e-mail I wrote) </p>\n<p>Hello Professors A and B, </p>\n<p>Earlier this year I looked over a paper that was published in 2010 called &quot;An adaptability limit to climate change due to heat stress\u201d. It made a strong impression on me. I think heat stress must be the biggest danger to human beings from climate change. If a region becomes uninhabitable, or at least uninhabitable to folks too poor to afford air conditioning, that trumps everything else. </p>\n<p>I wrote to you because I am puzzled that journalists and researchers do not seem to agree. For example in this article</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/1/9/14186328/risks-climate-change-graph\">https://www.vox.com/science-and-health/2017/1/9/14186328/risks-climate-change-graph</a></p>\n<p>David Roberts says, &quot;The risks of climate change are not easy to communicate clearly. Since the atmosphere affects everything, everything will be affected by its warming \u2014 there\u2019s no single risk, but a wide and varied array of risks, of different severities and scales, affecting different systems, unfolding on different timelines. It\u2019s difficult to convey to a layperson, at least without droning on and on.\u201d</p>\n<p>To me this sounds stupid. Partly this is because I am mostly concerned about the United States and a few other countries that I have some connection to. I am less concerned about saving the whale or preserving nature for its own sake. Okay, so maybe Roberts and I just disagree about values. (Explanations of social trends, let alone predictions, with many moving parts also seem suspect to me, i.e. <a href=\"http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/02/14/how-likely-are-multifactorial-trends/\">http://slatestarcodex.com/2015/02/14/how-likely-are-multifactorial-trends/</a> )</p>\n<p>But even the economic literature on climate seems flawed. I think Professor Martin Weitzman was correct in this paper when he said, &quot;we might be underestimating considerably the welfare losses from uncertainty by using a quadratic damages function and/or a thintailed temperature distribution.\u201d </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://docplayer.net/20146089-Ghg-targets-as-insurance-against-catastrophic-climate-damages.html\">http://docplayer.net/20146089-Ghg-targets-as-insurance-against-catastrophic-climate-damages.html</a>\nThat paper talks about perhaps losing 50% of GDP. </p>\n<p>There was a study that came out this year on heat stress in the United States. It extrapolated the changes in mortality from past hot days. But if there are days unlike any we have seen before, days where the wet bulb temperature approaches or exceeds human limits, then this extrapolation is not accurate. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/29/climate/southern-states-worse-climate-effects.html\">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/06/29/climate/southern-states-worse-climate-effects.html</a> (flawed) \n<a href=\"http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069611001033\">http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0095069611001033</a> (flawed) \n<a href=\"http://www.pnas.org/content/114/15/3861.short\">http://www.pnas.org/content/114/15/3861.short</a> (on nonlinearity) </p>\n<p>Also I do not see any research on future adaptation to heat stress.

I don\u2019t understand why the study that made headlines this year in the New York Times ignores the issue of the wet bulb limit. I don\u2019t understand why more hasn\u2019t been done on future adaptation to heat stress. I also don\u2019t see why heat stress doesn\u2019t have a higher profile in activist organizations trying to fight climate change and among people in the media. </p>\n<p>I hope you can share with me your views on these questions. </p>\n<p>Thank you, </p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "nobody"}}, {"_id": "mRErxoeJRxgxNatEo", "postedAt": "2018-02-12T16:46:43.689Z", "postId": "4E7f9eNbe4dMbnsme", "htmlBody": "<p>That was great, I've read about a lot of those things already, but it gave me some more reading material.

If I put money into a large number of causes, each of which has that profile, and if they are independent of each other, I accept that expected value kicks in. But in the case where I only get to make a contribution to a very limited number of causes, I don't see that expected value is the right philosophy. Can anyone help clarify?</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "musicant"}}, {"_id": "Zh8KaZTycXjSedrMR", "postedAt": "2018-04-23T12:41:10.629Z", "postId": "4E7f9eNbe4dMbnsme", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi all, Liv here (REG co-founder).

Firstly, I want to say that many people within the movement differ in how risk averse they are and make decisions with that taken into account. For example, this flowchart on deciding which cause to work on <a href=\"http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/09/flowhart/\">http://globalprioritiesproject.org/2015/09/flowhart/</a> has a question \u201cwould you rather do something that has a 1% chance of saving 1,000 lives than save one life for sure?\u201d I know some smart people who would answer that question with a \u201cno\u201d and behave accordingly.</p>\n<p>However, many EAs think that the 1% chance option is better and many EAs spend entire life\u2019s effort on causes like AI-safety even though it\u2019ll almost surely have no impact because for them it\u2019s not that important to make sure you have at least some impact, for them the small possibility of having a huge impact is just as motivating. I do share your feeling that having at least some impact is better, but personally I try to somewhat ignore it as a bias when making important decisions. To me, in some abstract sense, 1% chance of saving 1,000 lives is better than 100% chance of saving 1 life. In the same way that helping 10 people africa is in some abstract sense better than helping 1 person who lives in my country. And in the same way that helping 10 people who will live in million years is better than helping 1 person who is living now. Part of my brain disagrees but I choose to call that a bias rather than a part of my moral compass. Which IMO is a totally subjective choice.</p>\n<p>Even if all of us were risk averse, it might still make sense for all of us to cooperate and put money into different risky causes, because then there\u2019s a high probability that all of us combined will have a big positive impact. Instead of making sure that you yourself make a significant difference, you could think how EA community as whole (or humanity as a whole) could make a big positive difference. EA already supports many charities and maybe the risky charity that you donate to personally won\u2019t have an impact, but if many people support different risky charities like you will, all of us combined will have a bigger impact with a high probability.</p>\n<p>All that said, some EAs donate some money to causes that make sure that they have at least some impact and some money to risky causes with high expected value.
