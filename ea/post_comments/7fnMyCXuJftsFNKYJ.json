They usually only stay in business if customers are satisfied with the service they provide. Non-profits are accountable to their donors. The impressions of donors correlate imperfectly with the extent to which real needs are being served.</li>\n<li>First worlders usually aren't poor and don't need charity.</li>\n<li>You can donate the money you make to effective charities.</li>\n</ul>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Before anyone jumps on me here: IMO, an important takeaway from the FTX catastrophe is that EA-founded businesses should avoid mentioning EA in their marketing by default.  Even if you think you have a good reason to use EA in your marketing, you should still get CEA's permission first.</p>\n<p>Other good ways to not be like SBF include: Have detailed knowledge of what people are buying and accurately communicate it to customers, including your own uncertainty.  Pay special attention to identifying and mitigating ways in which your product could do harm (e.g. for a chewy food product, choking is an obvious potential hazard).  Do these things beyond what's required by law, and what's pragmatic from the point of view of maximizing profit.  Be willing to pull the plug on the business proactively if risks seem too high, or things aren't going in a good direction.</p>\n<p>If you aren't able to achieve healthy profits while respecting such ethical guidelines, that's an indicator that the business idea isn't promising and you should find something else.  Good business ideas are in \"blue oceans\" with little competition, plus somewhere you can build a durable competitive moat, meaning you won't be caught in a race to the bottom.</p>\n<p>Anyway, back to the post.  Your proposed interventions are \"mostly bottlenecked on improving awareness\".  In the business world, awareness is achieved through marketing.  You could sell a product which helps kids with jaw development, and your marketing could improve awareness of this problem as a side effect.</p>\n<p>What product could you sell?  Perhaps some sort of kid-themed chewy snacks -- a nutty animal cracker?  Or maybe a long, thin stick to minimize choking risk (with spiky sides so even if it gets caught in the throat they can still breathe around it?)  Maybe the snacks could come in grades of chewing difficulty, so you can put your kid on a step-by-step program of jaw development, gradually ramping them up from the soft foods they're eating right now.</p>\n<p>It'd be very tempting to promote this by saying: \"buy this $10 snack and you could save thousands on orthodontics down the road\".  That could be an amazing sales pitch.  But you want to be very careful in making any kind of health claim.  There are lawyers who specialize in navigating FDA regulations around such claims.  Maybe you'd want to start with a study measuring your product's impact on some sort of near-term proxy for jaw development, as a basis for eventually making such a claim.</p>\n<p>In terms of the professional treatment side, you could build a directory of dentists who e.g. work with expanders instead of doing extractions.  Then create a tool that helps a parent find such a dentist in their area, solicit dentist reviews from parents, advertise your tool, and make money through lead generation.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "John_Maxwell_IV"}}, {"_id": "zXo5hH4m5tfoegQhH", "postedAt": "2022-12-26T20:24:10.612Z", "postId": "7fnMyCXuJftsFNKYJ", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>Even if you think you have a good reason to use EA in your marketing, you should still get CEA's permission first.</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I strongly disagree with the idea that CEA (or any person or entity) should have that kind of ownership over \"effective altruism\".
