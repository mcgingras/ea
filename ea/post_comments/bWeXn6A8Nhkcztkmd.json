Don't feel discouraged by this, and I want to give richer feedback to adapt to. I think your post would be improved by explaining some reasons why you are asking about meditation practice here and not on other more meditation-focused fora such as <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/Meditation/\">/r/meditation</a>, <a href=\"https://old.reddit.com/r/streamentry/\">/r/streamentry</a> and the <a href=\"https://www.dharmaoverground.org/\">Dharma Overground</a>, or even on <a href=\"https://lesswrong.com/\">LessWrong</a> (which I think has a somewhat broader scope than the EA forum). It would also benefit from some tie-in to Effective Altruism.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "niplav"}}]
