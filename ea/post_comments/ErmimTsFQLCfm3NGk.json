Several coworkers and I now regularly use Excalidraw and Guesstimate. This has shaved about ~1 week off of a large project. Just napkin math here but we estimate our project will save 50 lives/week with a 1 in 10 chance of success. So by those numbers I'd say you saved about 5 lives with this project. Anyway, just napkin math, but I just wanted to say thank you!</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Erin"}}, {"_id": "Z3CkMsfYmrbMzNo4d", "postedAt": "2023-03-29T00:18:43.376Z", "postId": "ErmimTsFQLCfm3NGk", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for doing this!
