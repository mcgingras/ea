[edited to clarify that the information hasn't even been filed yet]</p>\n<p>No agreement in the linked doc on recommended sentence; it sounds like USAO is not going to recommend a \"specific\" sentence at all. The Guidelines sentence will be 110 years but that is rather unlikely to happen. There are ways to cap a defendant's exposure if the prosecution will agree but they were not done here. Then again, she probably had little negotiating power here. They did agree to not oppose fairly generous bail terms at least?</p>\n<p>My best guess is that she and Wang are looking at about a decade based on what top lieutenants to big-time scammers like Madoff got. My over/under on SBF is 27.5 years.
