In the conversation with Kelsey, SBF clarifies that he meant that <i>FTX</i> never invests customer deposits, that it is just acting as an exchange that facilitates borrowing and lending between its customers one of whom was Alameda.

Nominally the market value might have exceeded their liabilities, but it was exceptionally illiquid even before considering the fact that a lot of it was FTT and hence correlated with FTX solvency. They were evidently not automatically liquidated as any normal customer would be, and it sounds like their liabilities were not tracked by the normal system at all.<br><br>If this was just a huge risk management and accounting failure that would be merely bad, but the beneficiary was a hedge fund mostly owned by SBF whose leadership he had a close relationship with. From the outside it looks quite likely that they knew this was a possibility, but didn't want to liquidate Alameda after its losses in 2022 (or perhaps deliberately avoided getting clarity about the accounting situation?) because they had a good chance of making money during a market recovery and wanted to take one last gamble at the customer's expense.<br><br>This isn't technically FTX investing customer's money, but the risk management is so bad, the joint ownership so extreme, and the organizational boundaries so blurred by bad accounting, that it seems likely to be willful negligence and fair to say that they were effectively investing customer money.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>I assume FTX also didn't pay back customers who weren't participating in asset lending &nbsp;and who weren't getting paid interest on their deposits. I don't actually know details here, either about FTX or about finance in general, &nbsp;and they would affect my view about how bad this part was (though point 1 is bad at any rate). My guess is that it this outcome was basically inevitable once the exchange was having liquidity problems (I'd have been surprised if they halted withdrawals for margin accounts while they still had a ton of $ and liquid coins in other accounts) and the question is just how much of a betrayal that is.<br><br>For normal brokerage accounts, my vague sense of expectations is that margin accounts would be at risk of going down with the exchange, whereas normal accounts wouldn't. I don't know if that expectation is grounded in legal reality. I don't know if FTX had any such distinction.<br><br>I would guess that &nbsp;FTX customers had the choice to opt in to lending, though I wouldn't be surprised if it was opt-out or if uptake of lending was very large. And legally I don't know if customers who don't use margin accounts or who don't click the \"lend asset\" box or whatever are supposed to be protected (kind of like more senior creditors). Morally it seems like they have a reasonable expectation of not losing it but I expect this is also not straightforward fraud.</li></ol><p>Overall my sense is that this is probably not straightforward fraud, but I don't know and would appreciate a bit more clarity.</p>", "parentCommentId": "HtxGHLgGL95a9XT7a", "user": {"username": "Paul_Christiano"}}, {"_id": "houHDosokeYyCARFS", "postedAt": "2022-12-01T01:40:48.244Z", "postId": "WRvdL9jsXdBerWgte", "htmlBody": "<p>Doesn't FTX pay interest on deposits and prominently offer margin loans?

Does anyone have a link? My understanding is that FTX offered customers the opportunity to make leveraged trades, i.e., to bet more than the money they had in their accounts. This suggests to me that FTX was not just an exchange but a lender, which is a very different sort of financial beast (with a different risk profile). I also understand that there was a significant interest rate on the customer accounts -- 6% -- which adds weight to that conclusion. You can't get a return on investment without risk.&nbsp;<br><br>I'd also love to see links to the terms of service, as I've seen many state that Sam violated the terms of service but little evidence to that effect. I've seen one document that indicated the property of customers was their own. That's not legally dispositive of the issue, as FTX never claimed to have an ownership interest in the customer deposits. The question is what it was allowed to do with customer deposits and, for example, whether it was required to keep segregated accounts. Far larger and more sophisticated entities, like MF Global, have failed with account segregation, so it would not surprise me if FTX failed as well.<br><br>The basic problem is this. Even if you WANT to prevent yourself from using customer deposits, if you are a lender to various account holders (including ordinary retail customers) and you are not properly segregating the funds, then when a bunch of people borrow money from you, beyond what they invested into their account, they will inevitably tap into the money of other customers. Corporate controls, account segregation, etc will prevent this. But early stage companies very often fail with this sort of thing because it's hard, and often very labor intensive. I can see FTX not imposing a limit on Alameda's right to leverage because: (a) they were overconfident in the ability of Alameda to manage risk; &nbsp;(b) they never thought that Alameda's leverage would dip into the amount other customers needed; and/or (c) they assumed incorrectly that some form of legal segregation of accounts would prevent the technical removal of customer accounts from happening.&nbsp;</p><p>I don't know what the right answer is to any of these questions. What I do know, having looked at the inside of collapsing financial institutions, is that it is far far far more complicated than most people think. It is one of the reasons why there was no criminal prosecution in the MF Global case, despite what seemed to me far clearer evidence of wrongful conduct.&nbsp;</p><p>Re: prediction markets, they are interesting, and I hadn't seen them before.

The tweet by Sam Bankman Fried (or FTX Official, I don't remember, and I think it's now deleted) that said \"We never invest customer deposits, not even in something as secure as treasuries\"</p><p>Like, if you use your customer funds to finance loans to other clients, then clearly this does not count as \"never investing customer deposits\", since you did just invest your customer deposits into a loan to another client.

The FTX Terms of Service</strong></p><p>The <a href=\"https://help.ftx.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/9719619779348/FTX_Terms_of_Service.pdf\">FTX Terms of Service</a> seem to have a few different things in them that pertain to the stuff that happened. The most relevant piece I could find is:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>Any available Assets held in your Account is available to be locked and used as collateral for margin trading, or to fund trades, in relation to any Services or part thereof offered through the Platform by FTX Trading or its Affiliates.</p></blockquote><p>This pretty clearly says that your funds can be used as collateral for margin trading or to fund trades, though it is quite ambiguous about whether it's used as collateral for you, or for the position of other clients (or Alameda) in this case.</p><p>It wouldn't surprise me if this happened to be written intentionally ambiguously, though people with more finance experience might have better takes here. When reading this the first time, I definitely thought this was trying to say \"we might use any assets in your account as collateral for your other trades\", not \"we might use any assets in your account as collateral for some random other person's trades\".</p><p>The Terms of Service also say:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>(A) Title to your Digital Assets shall at all times remain with you and shall not transfer to FTX Trading. As the owner of Digital Assets in your Account, you shall bear all risk of loss of such Digital Assets. FTX Trading shall have no liability for fluctuations in the fiat currency value of Digital Assets held in your Account.&nbsp;</p><p>(B) None of the Digital Assets in your Account are the property of, or shall or may be loaned to, FTX Trading; FTX Trading does not represent or treat Digital Assets in User\u2019s Accounts as belonging to FTX Trading.&nbsp;</p><p>(C) You control the Digital Assets held in your Account. At any time, subject to outages, downtime, and other applicable policies (including the Terms), you may withdraw your Digital Assets by sending them to a different blockchain address controlled by you or a third party.</p></blockquote><p>This is a pretty tricky section. The ToS is between the client and FTX Trading, so it sure seems that somehow in the process of sending those assets to Alameda, it had to somehow enter the possession of FTX Trading.&nbsp;</p><p>I do have trouble understanding of how somehow FTX could end up with less than the depositors money/tokens in the bank/blockchain without somehow violating this part of the service agreement. Like, maybe there is some legal trickery where you get to say that due to the use of the customer funds as a collateral the assets directly transferred from client to Alameda or something, or to the trading partners of other clients who made a loss, but that sure seems like a huge stretch, and I feel like this section just straightforwardly says that if somehow FTX ended up sending a fraction of the customer deposits to any external party, whether it is to cover some losses or not, then they violated the ToS.</p><p>I can imagine there being some fancy legal defense here, but at least to me it looks really pretty clear. The ToS said that no assets deposited in FTX shall transfer to FTX Trading. Even if they were used as collateral, in the moment that FTX actually sends them to the debtor, they have to transfer through FTX Trading (who is the liable party), and as such violate the ToS.</p><p>So doing some more direct research here, both the public marketing statements made on Twitter, and the ToS seem to have been violated by the actual actions of FTX, though both sure could have some loophole that actually makes this a non-straightforward case of fraud, but at least I can't currently see any obvious loopholes (though someone with more legal experience very well might).</p><p>As I currently understand, the ToS basically committed FTX to cover the potential losses from leveraged trades <i>using its own profits or the assets of the users who had lending explicitly enabled</i>. Since they were committed to never take ownership over the assets that did not explicitly have lending enabled.&nbsp;</p><p>About $3B of the customer funds did seem to have lending enabled, and I think sending those to Alameda was likely fair game, though they can't cover close to the full amount, as far as I can tell.</p>", "parentCommentId": "s7q7xuhK7rSSWTDGR", "user": {"username": "Habryka"}}, {"_id": "r3v3f2e2XdYE7ey9z", "postedAt": "2022-12-01T02:02:01.854Z", "postId": "WRvdL9jsXdBerWgte", "htmlBody": "<blockquote><p>I haven't seen any evidence that FTX promised to never invest customer deposits.</p></blockquote><p>Here is a screenshot of the (now deleted) Tweet where SBF claims FTX does not invest customer deposits:&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FhqRDhLVsAAAwwu?format=png&amp;name=900x900\" alt=\"Bild\"></figure><p>Here is the relevant section of the FTX ToS:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>(A) Title to your Digital Assets shall at all times remain with you and shall not transfer to FTX Trading.

Second, using non-segregated customer deposits for another customer's leveraged trading may not be a loan.
