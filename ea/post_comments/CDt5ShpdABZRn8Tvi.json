Of course, as you point out, this does not mean the cost-effectiveness number outputted by the spreadsheet is all that matters! It is often hard to formalise all factors which influence cost-effectiveness, and so the actual cost-effectiveness estimates one obtains are not everything. Nevertheless, my impression is that GiveWell's cost-effectiveness estimates are pretty close to encompassing all their thinking.

In Nigeria, contraceptives are available, but many women are reluctant to use them due to misconceptions such as the belief that IUDs or birth control pills can cause infertility. FEM is seeking to raise 50% of their operating budget for 2023. This grant will go towards these operating costs, enabling them to reach more women with their broadcasts. A secondary goal of this grant is to put FEM in a stronger position to apply for funding for a randomized controlled trial; if such funding is received, they will be better able to assess impact and, if evidence is promising, to raise considerably more capital.</p></blockquote><p>GHDF has reports of a few sentences too, but it is effectively managed by people at GiveWell, which does in-depth research to inform their recommendations.

Aka I wouldn't want to prioritise something that sounds cool on a 'this is new basis' over something that is already known in EA, and is more cost-effective. Most of the decisions that I really agonise over are 'does this <strong>really</strong> beat bednets? Most things don't beat bednets, and I'm aware that most things seem less cost-effective as more researcher hours go into probing them'.

While that is an important purpose, it is not as predominant a purpose in my view. There are lots of monies out there that are practically restricted in a way that precludes AGF et al. from competing for them. This could be due to pre-defined government/foundation grant areas, or due to an individual donor's personal preferences, or a non-EA donor's desire for some higher quantum of warm fuzzies than organizations like AMF can provide. If we don't have anything to offer in those areas, we are conceding them to less effective charities.</p><p>All funding niches have low-hanging fruit and monies that are harder to acquire. For instance, speaking from personal experience, there are a lot of US evangelical Christians who won't donate to an organization unless it is Christian-flavored enough. As you might guess, I do not share that view -- but it is what it is, and some people with these views are wealthy. <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/D2wfYhB4rAMPkSnPt/kaleem-s-shortform?commentId=t6kNbZB2DKdHhihKx\">Kaleem's recent quick take on zakat</a> provides another possible example. Other donors really want to donate to mental-health causes, etc. Meanwhile, most GiveWell-recommended charities are significantly operating in a specific zone of fundraising (i.e., donors open to all sorts of charities without any self-imposed limitations). Thus, while it likely isn't cost-effective to fund organizations that operate in niches merely for the QUALYs they produce, it may be beneficial to support them in their earlier stages until they are developed enough to mine their niche for non-EA resources effectively.</p><p>&nbsp;Another consideration is that it is unlikely that the current top GHW charities will be as effective in ~20-30 years. It's plausible, albeit unlikely, that we will see PEPFAR levels of funding for malaria vaccines in the next decade or so. (Who would have predicted PEPFAR would have happened, and under Bush II at that?) Infectious disease and malnutrition generally become less overwhelming of a problem as a society develops economically. So an effective GHW field that doesn't grow and develop is unlikely to remain particularly effective in the long run.</p><p>That being said: while more cost-effective GHW meta opportunities may well exist, it may be rather difficult to find and evaluate many of them (outside of charity evaluators and effective-giving group support where the causal chain to impact is easier to determine). I'm curious, though, whether/why that would be so much harder in GHW than in longtermism or animal welfare (which do have EA Funds that will consider requests formerly fielded by EAIF).

We're also interested in having more in-depth conversations with Caleb and others involved in EA Funds about what the future of this fund should look like, and we\u2019ll reach out to schedule that.</p><p>In the meantime, here are some notes on our grantmaking and how donations to the fund are currently used.</p><ul><li><strong>We expect the impact of giving to the Global Health and Development Fund (GHDF) is about the same as giving to&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/all-grants-fund\"><strong><u>GiveWell's All Grants Fund</u></strong></a><strong>: both go to the most impactful opportunities we've identified (across programs and organizations), and are a good fit for donors who'd like to support the full range of our grantmaking, including higher-risk grants and research.</strong> The online description of GHDF was written before the All Grants Fund existed (it launched in 2022), and the two funds are now filling a very similar niche. Caleb, we'd love to collaborate on updating the GHDF webpage to both reflect the existence of the All Grants Fund and include more recent grant payout reports.</li><li><strong>In the broadest sense, GiveWell aims to maximize impact per dollar. </strong>Cost-effectiveness is the primary driver of our grantmaking decisions. But, \u201coverall estimated cost-effectiveness of a grant\u201d isn't the same thing as \u201coutput of cost-effectiveness analysis spreadsheet.\u201d (<a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2011/11/10/maximizing-cost-effectiveness-via-critical-inquiry/\"><u>This blog post</u></a> is old and not entirely reflective of our current approach, but it covers a similar topic.)</li><li><strong>The numerical cost-effectiveness estimate in the spreadsheet is nearly always the most important factor in our recommendations, but not the&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>only&nbsp;</strong></i><strong>factor.&nbsp;</strong>That is, we don\u2019t solely rely on our spreadsheet-based analysis of cost-effectiveness when making grants.&nbsp;<ul><li>We don't have an institutional position on exactly&nbsp;<i>how</i> much of the decision comes down to the spreadsheet analysis (though Elie's take of \"80% plus\" definitely seems reasonable!) and it varies by grant, but many of the factors we consider outside our models (e.g. qualitative factors about an organization) are in the service of making impact-oriented decisions. See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blog.givewell.org/2023/10/27/how-we-work-1-cost-effectiveness/\"><u>this post</u></a> for more discussion.&nbsp;</li><li>For a small number of grants, the case for the grant relies heavily on factors other than expected impact of that grant per se. For example, we sometimes make exit grants in order to be a responsible funder and treat partner organizations considerately even if we think funding could be used more cost-effectively elsewhere.</li><li>To add something to our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities\"><u>top charities list</u></a> (vs. make a grant from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/all-grants-fund\"><u>All Grants Fund</u></a> /&nbsp;<a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/global-development\"><u>GHDF</u></a>), we want a high degree of confidence in the program. See our list of additional criteria for top charities&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/criteria#Additional_Criteria_for_Top_Charities\"><u>here</u></a>; some of those criteria aren't proxies for cost-effectiveness, but are instead capturing whether a program provides the confidence and direct case for impact that donors expect from that product.&nbsp;</li><li>Also, we recognize it was confusing to have GiveDirectly on our top charity list when we believed our other top charities were substantially more cost-effective. Now, our list of top charities is limited to the programs that we think can&nbsp;<i>most</i> cost-effectively use marginal funding (currently, programs we believe to have room for more funding that is at least 10x unconditional cash transfers); see the fourth bullet point&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/how-we-work/criteria#Additional_Criteria_for_Top_Charities\"><u>here</u></a>.</li></ul></li></ul>", "parentCommentId": "Z7AezxvRZx3LCrMu3", "user": {"username": "GiveWell"}}, {"_id": "5LbJ3DT8jAJxGEjXk", "postedAt": "2023-12-23T06:33:00.925Z", "postId": "CDt5ShpdABZRn8Tvi", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for sharing your thoughts, Jason! I noticed it was downvoted. Excluding my strong upvote and your vote, it would have -7 karma for 2 votes.

I think it makes sense to strongly downvote comments which are only a few words, and have already tens of karma, but I believe substantive comments with not much karma like yours should only be strongly downvoted if they are offensive or have major factual errors.
