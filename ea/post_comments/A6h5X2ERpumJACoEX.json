Can't wait to hear how it progresses. I have an input that comes from decades doing a similar thing, as well as watching others do it...ie. trying to get influential people to promote an ideal...it's a trap to think you should prioritize going after the big names. Just promote altruism done effectively to any and all artists...the one's you work alongside, the one's at your level, then if higher level folks join with you, they can influence the artists who are at that same higher level as them. Let each person that wants to see the arts learn more about effectiveness/increased impact work amongst their own community. I've seen people waste so much energy chasing big names thinking their \"reach\" is the thing. It's not. It's the slow but steady adding this new idea into the culture until more and more artists turn their efforts toward greater impact...it's the grass roots, not the big names that really makes a difference.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "JeffreyK"}}, {"_id": "xXfHbHq5Ma6cPpXxe", "postedAt": "2023-03-25T17:06:09.156Z", "postId": "A6h5X2ERpumJACoEX", "htmlBody": "<p>Very cool!
