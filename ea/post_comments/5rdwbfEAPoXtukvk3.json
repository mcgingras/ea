I don't think that's entirely true. For example, the RAND meta-analysis <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/research/gun-policy/key-findings/what-science-tells-us-about-the-effects-of-gun-policies.html\">What Science Tells Us About the Effects of Gun Policies</a> shows moderate evidence that violence crime can be reduced by prohibitions associated with domestic violence, background checks, waiting periods, and stand-your-ground laws. Similarly, I believe that <a href=\"https://www.popularmechanics.com/cars/a11201/why-cars-are-safer-than-theyve-ever-been-17194116/\">progress in car safety engineering</a> has radically reduced the human suffering caused by reckless driving.

If you read things like <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/15/magazine/jennifer-doudna-crispr-interview.html\">this NYT interview with her from last week</a> she's saying things like:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><strong>Interviewer: It\u2019s also easy to imagine two different countries, let alone two different people, having competing ideas about what would constitute ethical gene editing. In an optimal world, would there be some sort of global body or institution to help govern and adjudicate these decisions?</strong> In an optimal world? This is clearly a fantasy.</p>\n<p><strong>OK, how about a suboptimal one?</strong> The short answer is: I don\u2019t know. I could imagine that given the complexities of using genome editing in different settings, it\u2019s possible that you might decide to use it differently in different parts of the world. Let\u2019s say an area where a mosquito-borne disease is endemic, and it\u2019s dangerous and high risk for the population. You might say the risk of using genome editing and the gene drive to control the mosquito population is worth it. Whereas doing it somewhere else where you don\u2019t face the same public-health issue, you might say the risk isn\u2019t worth it. So I don\u2019t know. The other thing is, as you indicated with the way you asked the question, having any global regulation and enforcing it \u2014 hard to imagine how that would be achieved. It\u2019s probably more realistic to have, as we currently do, scientific entities that are global that study these complex issues and make formal recommendations, work with government agencies in different countries to evaluate risks and benefits of technologies.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This doesn't seem like a person who is just arguing \"CRISPR should be everywhere, for everyone\". I also think she is <em>not</em> claiming to be an expert at making bioethical determinations of what technology should be deployed, and my sense from hearing her public speaking is that she is reluctantly taking on a mantle of going around and saying that we all need to have a very sober and open discussion about where and how CRISPR should be used, but that she doesn't feel particularly qualified to make those determinations herself. The <a href=\"https://innovativegenomics.org/programs/public-impact/\">Innovative Genomics Institute</a>, which she co-founded, has an entire research area dedicated to Public Impact, including initiatives like the <a href=\"https://innovativegenomics.org/bergit/\">Berkeley Ethics and Regulation Group for Innovative Technologies</a>. You can argue that these actions are poorly targeted, but I don't think it's accurate to frame Doudna as a naively pro-technology actor.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "h3B7MRAorosyikkRK", "user": {"username": "tessa"}}, {"_id": "JhazvT86ebgy5CyWo", "postedAt": "2022-08-25T12:36:04.017Z", "postId": "5rdwbfEAPoXtukvk3", "htmlBody": "<p>The article suggests, \"This service is for anyone who is seriously interested in working on mitigating <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/global-catastrophic-biological-risk\"><u>catastrophic biological risks</u></a>, like the risk of an engineered pandemic.\"</p><p>It's great that there are skilled people addressing this threat, and it seems very likely they will be able to make a constructive contribution which reduces the risk of an engineered pandemic which threatens civilization itself. &nbsp;The question I hope we are asking would be, is reducing the risk of an an engineered pandemic sufficient?
