My preferred version of this would engage with reasons in favor of Anthropic's actions, and how recent actions have concretely differed from what they've stated in the past.</p>\n<p>My understanding of (part of) their strategy has always been that they want to work with the largest models, and sometimes release products with the possibility of profiting off of them (hence the PBC structure rather than a nonprofit).

And the reason it goes so fast is the AI hype. For example, Altman himself, instead of addressing the concerns is writing an \"AGI utopia\" blog posts, seeing LLMs as a \"path to agi\". While it is an achievement, there are other techniques that are not included and which are not supported by LLMs, such as, causality, world model coherency, self-reference (ability of the model output, text, to reference it's inner states, neuronal activations, and vice versa, etc etc etc).</p>\n<p>Yet, it's advertised as \"almost AGI that is good for a lot of tasks\" even when it fails sometimes on simple number addition tasks.</p>\n<p>Again. He advertises something straight out of a research lab as a \"business solution\". And people buy it.</p>\n<p>To sum up, the harms today originate from the pressure to do it all fast, created by unrealistic hype. Here's an analogy I have: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sergia_ch/status/1629467480778321921?s=20\">https://twitter.com/sergia_ch/status/1629467480778321921?s=20</a></p>\n<p>Concrete harms, today:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>there was an \"AI mental health\" app unleashed without disclosing full specifics to the trial patients, sometimes with people not knowing they're taking to AI, and being in the trial at all. As a result, when they found out, they were understandably more depressed</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>there are artists whose work was taken for training without consent, as a result, some lost job opportunities w/o \"UBI\" promised by Altman</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>there is bias against certain groups of people in systems already doing processing resumes, doing legal trial verdicts, etc</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>there was an \"AI girlfriend\" startup replika that was making abusive statements. Later, the \"girlfriend\" functionality was made into a \"friend functionality\".

Totally ok to ask questions after reading.</p>\n<p>In all those cases it's mostly the speed and the \"move fast break things\" attitude that is the problem, not the tech itself. For example, if the patients were informed properly, the trial done correctly, the app re-trained properly to heal mental health issues, it might have been something.

It is a system. Any system can be broken. It needs assumptions to work. Capitalism is a human system operating well under certain assumptions, not a law of the universe (like Schr\u00f6dinger's equation that is true in all cases except quantum gravity, a very rare thing, not usually important or present in every day life)</p>\n<p>The assumptions are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>a lot of small entities competing, creating field-like dynamics where if, say, a company is suboptimal, a new one is created with little overhead resources, like a new Linux process replacing a failed one. This is not the case in tech. There are monopolies, and novel contexts such as \"network effects\". Monopolies change the dynamics, not allowing to use a \"field metaphor\" anymore. There are simply not enough particles for the field approximation to work. For example, when there were Nokia, Motorola, and all those old phone companies making phones, there was innovation. Now we have iPhone and Android, and there are not much new features. Instead, phones are getting more walled-gardened, something a significant portion of consumers doesn't want. In the Linux analogy, the existing big process takes so much memory that a new one can't even allocate. The system is \"jammed\"</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The reason \"market\" doesn't work here is the monopoly: the companies don't have competition, already have enough profit, and kinda agree with each other to be kinda the same: both android and iPhone become more walled-gardened, despite a significant portion of consumers wanting an alternative.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>the choices of consumers and businesses are informed. Consumers roughly know what they are getting. Consider a case when, say, McDonald's starts to make burgers from stale meat, but doesn't tell that to customers. So far, nobody knows. If a new company offers better product with fresh meat, not many consumers would go there (assuming McDonald's fried it so hard that consumers can't tell anymore). However, if there's a news story about stale meat at McDonald's dangerous for health, people would go to the new business likely.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This applies to LLMs. People are being sold hype, not real \"AI from sci-fi assisting humans\". People are harmed because they eat \"stale meat\" without being informed about what they're eating</p>\n<p>The hype seems stable, and if we look at historical precedents of hype, like crypto, it can go on for years without \"bursting\".</p>\n<p>In addition, the very nature of LLMs and how they can be used for misinformation make it even less likely that there would be good Informed choices in our model. The product (LLM) different from a traditional product (like shoes) which is analyzed in models of capitalism. This product changed how things work, changes the model.</p>\n<p>There are other assumptions, like, there is some regulation (medical field couldn't go without regulation. It didn't work, people were buying literal snake oil, and companies were literally poisoning places, see the story behind this movie: <a href=\"https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Waters_(2019_film)\">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Waters_(2019_film)</a> )</p>\n<p>For those who are \"fully libertarian\". I'm talking about \"some regulation\", not \"Stalin\". I'm from Russia, we have \"Putin\". He regulates everything, including whether I can say \"stop the war\" or not. That is too much regulation.</p>\n<p>There's the case with a chemical monopolist company with a lot of lawyers and connections polluting the rivers and killing people (say above). Not regulating this is \"too little regulation\".</p>\n<p>I am a leftist liberal, yet I am for <em>some</em> regulation, not too much regulation. Too much regulation is extreme. Too little is extreme. There is \"just right\" that is probably subjective, but we can discuss it together and agree on what is \"just right\" for us all.</p>\n<p>Ideally, the businesses are many, they are competing and they are independent. Ideally, the strength of the government is enough to stop monopolies and crimes of companies, but not enough to dominate all the companies in all domains. A bit of this. A bit of that.</p>\n<p>That is how I see it.</p>\n<p>To sum up my last point, LLMs have not enough regulation (basically none so far).</p>\n<p>Hope I explained it.

There's a reason why Europe has basically no native tech industry to speak of and is increasingly losing out to the US even in sectors like pharma where it was traditionally very strong.

(The rest of the post is also worth checking out.)</p><blockquote><h2>Why OpenAI Thinks Their Research Is Good Now, But Might Be Bad Later</h2><p>OpenAI understands the argument against burning timeline. But they counterargue that <i>having the AIs</i> speeds up alignment research and all other forms of social adjustment to AI. If we want to prepare for superintelligence - whether solving the technical challenge of alignment, or solving the political challenges of unemployment, misinformation, etc - we can do this better when everything is happening gradually and we\u2019ve got concrete AIs to think about:</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><i>\"We believe we have to continuously learn and adapt by deploying less powerful versions of the technology in order to minimize \u201cone shot to get it right\u201d&nbsp;scenarios [\u2026] As we create successively more powerful systems, we want to deploy them and gain experience with operating them in the real world. We believe this is the best way to carefully steward AGI into existence\u2014a gradual transition to a world with AGI is better than a sudden one. We expect powerful AI to make the rate of progress in the world much faster, and we think it\u2019s better to adjust to this&nbsp;incrementally.</i></p><p><i>A gradual transition gives people, policymakers, and institutions time to understand what\u2019s happening, personally experience the benefits and downsides of these systems, adapt our economy, and to put regulation in place. It also allows for society and AI to co-evolve, and for people collectively to figure out what they want while the stakes are relatively&nbsp;low.\"</i></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>You might notice that, as written, this argument doesn\u2019t support full-speed-ahead AI research. If you really wanted this kind of gradual release that lets society adjust to less powerful AI, you would do something like this:</p><ul><li>Release AI #1</li><li>Wait until society has fully adapted to it, and alignment researchers have learned everything they can from it.</li><li>Then release AI <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Ps8ecFPBzSrkLC6ip/2018-2019-long-term-future-fund-grantees-how-did-they-do\">2018-2019 Long-Term Future Fund Grantees: How did they do?</a> Wait until society has fully adapted to it, and alignment researchers have learned everything they can from it.</li><li>And so on . . .</li></ul><p>Meanwhile, in real life, OpenAI released ChatGPT in late November, helped Microsoft launch the Bing chatbot in February, and plans to announce GPT-4 in a few months. Nobody thinks society has even partially adapted to any of these, or that alignment researchers have done more than begin to study them.</p><p>The only sense in which OpenAI supports gradualism is the sense in which they\u2019re not doing lots of research in secret, then releasing it all at once. But there are lots of better plans than either doing that, <i>or</i> going full-speed-ahead.</p><p>So what\u2019s OpenAI thinking? I haven\u2019t asked them and I don\u2019t know for sure, but I\u2019ve heard enough debates around this that I have some guesses about the kinds of arguments they\u2019re working off of. I think the longer versions would go something like this:</p><p><strong>The</strong> <strong>Race Argument</strong>:</p><ol><li>Bigger, better AIs will make alignment research easier. At the limit, if no AIs exist at all, then you have to do armchair speculation about what a future AI will be like and how to control it; clearly your research will go faster and work better after AIs exist. But by the same token, studying early weak AIs will be less valuable than studying later, stronger AIs. In the 1970s, alignment researchers working on industrial robot arms wouldn\u2019t have learned anything useful. Today, alignment researchers can study how to prevent language models from saying bad words, but they can\u2019t study how to prevent AGIs from inventing superweapons, because there aren\u2019t any AGIs that can do that. The researchers just have to hope some of the language model insights will carry over. So all else being equal, we would prefer alignment researchers get more time to work on the later, more dangerous AIs, not the earlier, boring ones.</li><li>\u201cThe good people\u201d (usually the people making this argument are referring to themselves) currently have the lead. They\u2019re some amount of progress (let\u2019s say two years) ahead of \u201cthe bad people\u201d (usually some combination of Mark Zuckerberg and China). If they slow down for two years now, the bad people will catch up to them, and they\u2019ll no longer be setting the pace.</li><li>So \u201cthe good people\u201d have two years of lead, which they can burn at any time.</li><li>If the good people burn their lead now, the alignment researchers will have two extra years studying how to prevent language models from saying bad words. But if they burn their lead in 5-10 years, right before the dangerous AIs appear, the alignment researchers will have two extra years studying how to prevent advanced AGIs from making superweapons, which is more valuable. Therefore, they should burn their lead in 5-10 years instead of now. Therefore, they should keep going full speed ahead now</li></ol><p><strong>The</strong> <strong>Compute Argument</strong>:</p><ol><li>Future AIs will be scary because they\u2019ll be smarter than us. We can probably deal with something a little smarter than us (let\u2019s say IQ 200), but we might not be able to deal with something much smarter than us (let\u2019s say IQ 1000).</li><li>If we have a long time to study IQ 200 AIs, that\u2019s good for alignment research, for two reasons. First of all, these are exactly the kind of dangerous AIs that we can do good research on - figure out when they start inventing superweapons, and stamp that tendency out of them. Second, these IQ 200 AIs will probably still be <i>mostly</i> on our side <i>most </i>of the time, so maybe they can do some of the alignment research themselves.</li><li>So we want to maximize the amount of time it takes between IQ 200 AIs and IQ 1000 AIs.</li><li>If we do lots of AI research now, we\u2019ll probably pick all the low-hanging fruit, come closer to optimal algorithms, and the limiting resource will be compute - ie how many millions of dollars you want to spend building giant computers to train AIs on. Compute grows slowly and conspicuously - if you\u2019ve just spent $100 million on giant computers to train AI, it will take a while before you can gather $1 billion to spend on even gianter computers. Also, if terrorists or rogue AIs are gathering a billion dollars and ordering a giant computer from Nvidia, probably people will notice and stop them.</li><li>On the other hand, if we do very little AI research now, we might not pick all the low-hanging fruit, and we might miss ways to get better performance out of smaller amounts of compute.

But at some point a stronger AI will do something really scary - maybe murder a few people with a drone. Then everyone will agree that AI is dangerous, there will be a concerted social and international response, and maybe something useful will happen. Maybe more of the world\u2019s top geniuses will go into AI alignment, or will be easier to coordinate a truce between different labs where they stop racing for the lead.</li><li>It would be nice if that happened five years before misaligned superintelligences building superweapons, as opposed to five months before it, since five months might not be enough time for the concerted response to do something good.</li><li>As per the previous two arguments, maybe going faster now will lengthen the interval between the first scary thing and the extremely dangerous things we\u2019re trying to prevent.</li></ol><p>These three lines of reasoning argue that that burning a lot of timeline now might give us a little more timeline later.

It doesn't feel ok to me to believe in that.</p>\n<p>People here believe in utilitarianism (see comments of Sabs, he's not alone in this), which usually makes people like me the \"mere ripples\".</p>\n<p>It would just feel weird: a peasant helping the master to deal with some issue together?</p>\n<p>The world is not ready for it.</p>\n<p>I'd love to be proved wrong though.</p>\n<p>I have experience that it's like this: I say something, polite, not polite, anything, related to this set of issues - I get downvoted or asked to \"rephrase it in some way\".</p>\n<p>What I really want is answers.</p>\n<p>Like, the RX/TX balance of this conversation is: I sent a lot of stuff to EAs, got not much neaniful response.</p>\n<p>So I stop.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "rDTWHvwFaEHcBnwBt", "user": {"username": "sergeivolodin"}}, {"_id": "inbdx4TeGrjLcuBTn", "postedAt": "2023-03-07T17:06:42.901Z", "postId": "bmfR73qjHQnACQaFC", "htmlBody": "<p>Do you believe in it?</p>\n<p>Just seems weird if someone said \"to be safe from a deadly disease, what we really need is to develop it as soon as we can\"</p>\n<p>I get that the metaphore has holes, just, seems a bit \"out there\".</p>\n<p>I'd say that \"to have safe agi, we need to do agi engineering the fastest way possible\" is a very extraordinary claim.</p>\n<p>It requires very extraordinary evidence to support it.</p>\n<p>My thing which is \"can we ask them to explain it\" seems like a very ordinary claim to me.</p>\n<p>So it doesn't require much evidence at all.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "Fx7C2ndivmCNZbSTA", "user": {"username": "sergeivolodin"}}, {"_id": "vpLHHaiQA37LBa5eo", "postedAt": "2023-03-07T17:23:52.314Z", "postId": "bmfR73qjHQnACQaFC", "htmlBody": "<p>I'm mostly leaving - I have said basically the same thing over and over again. In a polite way. In a more twitter way like here. The Concerned EAs said it in an EA forum style post. At this point, I see that I have done everything that I could.</p>\n<p>In general, I feel this conversation between leftists and EAs fails because of holistic vs logical reasoning.</p>\n<p>EAs tend to believe that \"logical reasoning\" is superior to \"holistic reasoning\"</p>\n<p>Holistic reasoning is good at spotting patterns. Logic is good at disproving the patterns exist, by cutting the thing into a taxonomy with a sharp razor of this logical reasoning.</p>\n<p>What I'm presenting is a pattern. Of course it's not a completely correct statement in a logical sense: I don't really know how it is. All I say is: I'm concerned that I see it.</p>\n<p>What I get in response is not \"sure, let's brainstorm, steelman it\". Or better \"sure, let's see if it's a valid pattern by taking action and see if the response is consistent with the pattern (active exploration, needed to uncover the causal structure. I did a thesis on this). It's not possible to obtain the correct model from observation alone in some cases. Neither internal monologue about the observation would help the agent. Only action and testing the hypothesis\"</p>\n<p>I feel it's like a paper review, not beanstormig. \"Everything wrong with this in a 1000 words\" rather than \"here's what I agree with. Here's what I disagree with. Here's my evidence\".</p>\n<p>That's why it feels not friendly for me to talk to EAs. I tried it soo sooo many times, every time my pattern that is connected to my personality gets dissected, traumatizing and invalidating me. Questioning my very axioms that I have discovered with sweat and pain, rather than saying whether they agree with a statement itself.</p>\n<p>Questioning my holistic thinking that lives with the logical one quite well together for me.</p>\n<p>To me some posts read us a call for me to abandon my emotional side and use only logic (such as, libertarian utilitarianism by Sabs or \"red pill is OK in EA\" in the most downvoted subthread here)</p>\n<p>I want balance, I want both. To me \"only logic, only one way of thinking\" is very extreme. You saw my other posts - I can do mathy things too. Just, I believe that if I only see and do mathy things, my world model would be incomplete, my exploration would be doomed, and my prior will not be universal. It would be \"intelligence used to shoot itself in the foot\"</p>\n<p>There is no way to explain it. It just happened to me once that I met a person who showed this to me, reminded me of something I forgot. The dream I had of \"math being superior to humanities and such\" collapsed, like in the Inception movie.</p>\n<p>Where I am now feels better. I can feel again. I feel whole. And I can still do math. I am sometimes uncomfortable with using math without emotion. Like, taking about genocide and saying \"it's not significant because the number of dead people is low\"</p>\n<p>It's not the way.</p>\n<p>See my post about the matrix trilogy: <a href=\"https://dair-community.social/@sergia/109979018708128244\">https://dair-community.social/@sergia/109979018708128244</a> and about how sometimes the seeming necessity of a choice is the problem, an artifact of the decision-making system rather than an objective necessity.</p>\n<p>I see emotion as something helping to see a bit beyond the tunnel vision of logic.</p>\n<p>It all changed for me when I saw the intensity of suffering of just one person who is not like me. I couldn't think of it as pure numbers or \"mere ripples\". Feeling what they feel.</p>\n<p>I don't want this - never again anyone has to feel this bad.</p>\n<p>I reject utilitarianism : I am from an ex-communist country which loved utilitarianism (and still does: Putin says \"I'm going to save the world from the evil west,  but to do so we're gonna need to kill a lot of people\" - people believe in this there!)</p>\n<p>I believe this can be done, caring about everyone, at least, I will do my best. That doesn't require any viokence I believe, not at all. Those who did agressive violence in the name of peace were utilitarians! Lenin and those people. F them :) they totally didn't get anything I think.</p>\n<p>See more on why I believe so here: <a href=\"https://dair-community.social/@sergia/109977128036067592\">https://dair-community.social/@sergia/109977128036067592</a></p>\n<p>(Side note: it is at the same time surprising but I feel this many times so it's not surprising at all now: a complete and total lack of interest from EAs towards asking questions about my story, the actual evidence I have. Like, nobody cares what happened in real-life with real people - only if there's some mathy philosophy anything is worth anything \ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94\ud83d\udc94)</p>\n<p>That can't be explained, no matter how many walls of text I write. That one life is worth more than any philosophy or any belief system or any ideology, anything like that</p>\n<p>I will say this out loud: I am extremely concerned that a secretive group of people who see superiority as acceptable (men over women in \"red pill\", majority vs minority in \"utilitarianism\", big over small in \"total libertarianism\") are engineering an \"AI revolution\" with manifestos and promises of \"UBI\", with no plan how to get there, only promises and handwaving, and ignore current crimes and harms done by them in the face of some \"greater good\" they imagine in their utopian manifestos.</p>\n<p>If we replace \"red pill\" with \"male supremacy\", \"libertarianism\" with \"communism\" and \"AI\" with \"collectivism\", and \"UBI\" well with \"UBI\", we have a clear parallel between now and a 100 years ago. first in Moscow now in silicon valley. Both were not nice to women (and had a \"theory of all theories\" to justify that), not nice to minorities (both saw them as a nuisance, didn't believe ever that \"people are different\", saw everyone the same because they themselves never met anyone not like them, of course, with a \"theoretical justification\"). Both imagined some \"grand future\" for which it was acceptable (and kinda encouraged) to do crimes in the present.</p>\n<p>The story a 100 years ago went like this: the Red Communists, the most utilitarian ones, killed everyone who had concerns over the validity of their philosophy.</p>\n<p>If it comes to this, you'll see that I'll not defend myself. I don't want to be in a world dominated by utilitarians. All full of utopias in their heads, and actual real poor people on the streets. All imagined, all fake. I'll do my peaceful thing. That is it.</p>\n<p>Just one life is more important than all those mental sandcastles.</p>\n<p>That is it - that is goodbye.</p>\n<p>There were some nice things, some nice people I met in EA. I still want to talk to them</p>\n<p>In general, this is a goodbye.</p>\n<p>Goodbye!</p>\n<p>I would totally love to talk \"real\". A conversation that doesn't feel I talk to a sociopath who would rather believe in some philosophy than even try to help real people.</p>\n<p>The real thing is:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>it takes 10 minutes to write a question to Anthropic</li>\n<li>there's potential upside</li>\n<li>there's no potential downside in asking a question</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Instead people here ask \"well shall I even spend 1 second on making sense of it, or is it all total bs\"?</p>\n<p>It's not a school assignment. It's like you say \"oh teacher the assignment seems contrarctory\" and the teacher is like \"oh sure that's a typo\". I'm not here to fix typos. I did it and it didn't lead to answers.</p>\n<p>It's real world. Nobody knows the full truth, there's no one true theory, there's no reward for an assignment and there's no assignment.</p>\n<p>Since some of you are in a country where culture war is going up, I'd strongly recommend to learn from partially correct information - inferring emotion instead of \"parse error on line 1\".</p>\n<p>Then we can heal it. There's not one single person who's perfect.</p>\n<p>What does seem odd is completely downvoting a person for asking questions to the core of a philosophy.</p>\n<p>What does seem odd is seeing a post advocating for \"Even More Centralisation\" after all that has transpired and all that has been said. It's heartbreaking to me because I know where it leads. I have that experience. For you it's a \"map\", I have memory of real territory. For you it's \"form\", for me it has meaning.</p>\n<p>Please reach out to someone who knows the territory. Someone outside of this group that believes they have answers to everything...</p>\n<p>Save yourself. Really.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "zorwBRapg2kJZ5AqW", "user": {"username": "sergeivolodin"}}]
