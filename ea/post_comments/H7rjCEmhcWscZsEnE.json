If I might make one request if you are intending to write more posts on this topic: Could you please include a colonial &nbsp;and even more of a \"temporal\" angle to growth and well-being? You do go into some detail around skipping the manufacturing \"step\" and going directly to services. However, my lay understanding of the topic is that it somehow seemed much easier for the \"colonizing\" nations to move beyond agriculture and achieve both growth and increases in well-being than it today does for LMICs. Currently, it seems like an uphill struggle for previous colonies to do the same. Is there some sort of temporal thing going on here where the \"colonizing\" nations had some sort of first-mover advantage? Perhaps I missed something by only reading quickly through your article - perhaps most of you analysis only focuses on what we know about growth in previous colonies, after colonization ended, for example.&nbsp;<br><br>One reason for commenting is that I recently read a book both on the famines in India under British rule as well as another book on China under Mao. In both instances, it seems economic structural reform was pushed forcefully and urgently from the top which as we know lead to two of the greatest disasters in history. Thus, I would, without deep knowledge of the topic, be very careful advocating strongly for general economic reforms across many countries as we could end up having a net negative outcome, just based on historical priors. I would, as a lay economist and historian, feel more confident about a portfolio of interventions that have been crafted to fit with the local context and strategic environment a country currently finds itself in.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Ulrik Horn"}}, {"_id": "KfDb9JwnyYfAk3Buk", "postedAt": "2023-12-04T10:56:45.609Z", "postId": "H7rjCEmhcWscZsEnE", "htmlBody": "<p>I'm not super interested in stories of growth that put a large emphasis on history, not because I think they're wrong, but because they don't offer a lot of practical advice for today. There are a thousand and one papers showing that colonial legacies affect development today, but I don't see how they help think about increasing growth today. Certainly, I wouldn't completely generalize from the growth experience of the West, and almost all of the research I cover is about current LMICs or about late industrializers in East Asia.</p>\n<p>I agree that advocating strongly for general economic reforms - call it the Lant Pritchett view - is not a useful path.

There's a lot of evidence that colonial legacies hold countries back today, especially in Africa. On the other hand there's strong reasons to believe that new technologies are the drivers of growth, and poor countries today have the advantage that they don't need to reinvent all modern technology - they have all the advantages of frontier knowledge. The net effect of this is so vague as to be unanswerable.</p>\n<p>As a concrete example, think about London's campaign to end cholera in the 19th century. Compared to countries with cholera problems today, those people <em>didn't even know what caused disease.</em> There were all kinds of crazy views about the causes of disease that made eradicating cholera a difficult task. On the other hand, Britain had a pretty effective state that could enforce public health regulations, and a good scientific establishment that could study the problem. Poor countries today have 1000x more knowledge than rich countries did a century ago, but have all kinds of problems with turning that knowledge into prosperity.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "eyccesdCcsWjGwwsh", "user": {"username": "therealslimkt"}}, {"_id": "dk49oKHbx4A8s56oe", "postedAt": "2023-12-04T10:59:02.216Z", "postId": "H7rjCEmhcWscZsEnE", "htmlBody": "<p>I don't know enough about growth diagnostics to give any authoritative take. it seems like a pretty useful way to structure thinking/field observations, but with sweeping/high-level conclusions that don't feel quite so useful.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "GE7Y4zCK9rFisq5Mz", "user": {"username": "therealslimkt"}}, {"_id": "AoKg7XK4YL8bq9dY2", "postedAt": "2023-12-04T12:20:18.273Z", "postId": "H7rjCEmhcWscZsEnE", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for your super thoughtful response Karthik.

Presumably we will always need some people working in agriculture. A lot of this specialisation has occurred between rural and urban areas, but might it not also make sense for some entire countries to focus on agriculture? They could focus their education systems, regulations and so on the industry, which might improve efficiency, rather than having smaller numbers of people in more countries doing agriculture. If this is the case then we could see some countries getting rich entirely off agriculture - just like there are wealthy farmers in the US, Australia, etc. If so pushing for sectoral transformation could be a mistake if some countries really have a comparative advantage in agriculture.</p><p>This also connects to your points about agricultural productivity. My impression was that many third world countries have chronic under-utilisation of labour; you literally just have a lot of working age men hanging around doing nothing all day. This is labour slack is implicit in the model for why GiveDirectly might boost economic activity that they <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/KAzSt4w57yHmdvFwS/169-on-whether-cash-transfers-cause-economic-growth-and\">described on the 80k podcast</a>. If so, productivity growth that incentivized people to stay in agriculture could be good, especially if it replaced unemployment, even though it would retard the sectoral transformation.</p><p>Finally, I was interested in the negative effects of the services transition.

And there are clear reasons why; agricultural goods are commodities that are extremely cheap, so even having an advantage in them, you can only have a slim advantage.

Compare that to manufacturing where you can make increasingly specialized and high-quality goods that generate much more profits.</p>\n<p>My impression is that underutilization of labor is even more severe of a problem in agriculture than in non-agriculture. This is why in most developing countries, output <em>per worker</em> is higher in manufacturing than in agriculture. You would likely not observe that if surplus labor was unique to manufacturing, and indeed the surplus labor hypothesis was first proposed to explain why agriculture is so unproductive. (Edit: I think I misunderstood this point from you. Yes, productivity growth that increases the demand for labor could put some of that surplus labor to good use, and that can be good. However, if the surplus workers would have counterfactually moved into non-agriculture where they would have been more productive, then it's still a negative outcome.)</p>\n<p>No, that's not why services have a negative effect. Theres no assumption that services are not valuable, just that productivity growth (as measured by revenue per worker growth) is much slower. This is mostly because services are nontradable, so you can't have specialization/competition between producers in different regions. But I have a footnote pointing out why we should be careful in claiming that shifting to services has a negative effect.

I think the authors' interpretation is probably wrong. There's no clear reason why demand for more personalized goods would be different in Uganda, you're right - my suspicion is that the root cause is the small size of the output market. The authors document that each firm sells to a very small output market, and one possible consequence of that is that firms don't see any benefit to task specialization, because the benefits of specialization increase with the scale of goods you are selling. If you can only sell to a small number of people, then selling them personalized goods could be a way to get the maximum revenue out of this small market. Thus, firms would choose not to specialize even if there were no barriers to specialization.</p>\n<p>The main evidence they provide for why personalized demand is the cause is that specialization is larger in grain milling, where grain is a homogeneous product. But grain is also more easily traded, so the output market is larger, which means their evidence is totally consistent with small output markets as the cause of low specialization and firm growth.</p>\n<p>Small output markets are a problem everywhere but especially in Africa because transportation costs are higher than in other developing countries (this is something I've heard dev economists say casually a lot, but I've never seen an explicit citation).</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "KBitu2Dhk6YJjQztn", "user": {"username": "therealslimkt"}}, {"_id": "LZqppD6rD4vxLRPhc", "postedAt": "2023-12-13T16:21:22.802Z", "postId": "H7rjCEmhcWscZsEnE", "htmlBody": "<p>An intervention that's on my mind is leveraging the sheer intelligence of some EAs to build a <i>factory design company</i> that is focused on building tools and processes for manufacturing.

And when you buy services, the person from whom you bought the services also buys stuff. So if people get richer at scale, the country as a whole tends to bleed that money back out.
