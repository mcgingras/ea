I'm looking for something similar to the <a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/LTtNXM9shNM9AC2mp/superintelligence-faq\">Superintelligence FAQ</a>, but selected based on success at explaining wild animal welfare instead of AGI. I know a couple scholars but haven't introduced them yet and want to make sure I do it right.

For example, the 80,000 hours page debunks the naturalistic fallacy quickly and efficiently, which indicates that the authors were serious about writing it well, but otherwise it's kinda sparse (maybe the authors put a lot of effort into making it short so it's easier to read and recommend?) and even tries to redirect people to farmed animal welfare instead.</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "trevorw96"}}]
