A reason to believe that was the case is that <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4601132/#:~:text=Discussion,benefits%20both%20reduction%20and%20cessation\">smokers that smoke less cigarettes are more likely to quit</a>.

Given the available estimates, many of these projections assume that the impact on adult prevalence is half of the overall elasticity and that youth uptake of tobacco use is two to three times as responsive to price. When projecting the impact on youth, these projection models often assume that young people will take up smoking at the same rate as adults or young adults have. Continuing the example above, if the state has one million adults and adult smoking prevalence is 20% (200,000 adult smokers), the US$ 1.00 tax increase <strong>will reduce the prevalence of adult smoking by 4%, or induce 8,000 adult smokers to quit smoking.</strong> If there are 500,000 young people in the state, and it is assumed that they will take up smoking at the same rate as adults have and youth smoking is twice as sensitive to price, then the US$ 1.00 tax increase maintained over time in real terms <strong>will prevent 8,000 young people from taking up smoking.</strong><br><br><strong>Econometric studies of the impact of tax and price on tobacco use employ two primary measures of tobacco use: (1) macro-level aggregate measures of consumption, such as country-level data on tobacco sales&nbsp;</strong>(this literature developed earlier, growing rapidly before the 1990s); <strong>and (2) household or individual-level data taken from surveys, such as national surveys of drug use or health risk behavior.</strong></p><p>Additionally, studies have assessed the impact of tax and price on specific outcomes, such as prevalence of tobacco use, smoking cessation, initiation of smoking by youth, cross-price elasticity, and <strong>health outcomes.</strong></p>", "parentCommentId": "jMReHmdtbsZgjn2Ta", "user": {"username": "Yelnats T.J."}}, {"_id": "gHrtGevruRFFjr24L", "postedAt": "2023-06-02T06:31:00.944Z", "postId": "RRm8vnmwjWK24ung2", "htmlBody": "<p>I'm very excited about this intervention!

A few things I would like addressed for me to buy this more.</p><ol><li>Effect on the healthcare system. Tobacco smoking probably saves a lot of healthcare dollars... by killing the person a bit earlier and thus they consume less healthcare over their life (particularly when they are no longer contributing to the tax base. <a href=\"https://www.kff.org/report-section/the-rising-cost-of-living-longer-introduction/).\">https://www.kff.org/report-section/the-rising-cost-of-living-longer-introduction/).</a> This isn't super well accounted for in many sources</li><li>If they aren't included in CEAs, I'd like to see some analysis done on the increase in black market tobacco sales that are likely. If you increase taxes enough, this often results in black market increase which I expect to be more prevalent in LMICs.</li><li>I would like to see an account of deaths that are caused by smoking vs. a contributing cause. The WHO and CDC will often fudge/juice numbers to advocate for certain outcomes. I expect this to be difficult to do.</li><li>Factor in that a death from smoking will be from someone who is older than someone who died of malaria (this is factored into DALYs but not the GWWC report for \"lives saved\")</li><li>This will probably be minor but factor in the poorer economics of the country from the higher taxation.</li></ol>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "MarcusAbramovitch"}}, {"_id": "PMk9R6hoZcWsHZMwg", "postedAt": "2023-06-03T01:26:28.422Z", "postId": "RRm8vnmwjWK24ung2", "htmlBody": "<p>There is a net financial effect on public expenditures due to premature death from smoking, but it's overwhelmingly to the old-age pension system, not to the healthcare system.

Here is the trend: lung cancer used to be a quick death, but medical advances in palliative care now give patients the opportunity to live much longer whilst regularly undergoing intensive medical procedures (e.g radiation treatment)</li><li>So I think it\u2019s an okay question on if black market effects have a significant enough effect that it should be modeled into the CEA. However, this is a different question than if there is reason to believe that black market effects would knock the intervention\u2019s cost-effectiveness down a whole tier, which I believe the answer is no. The experts have been clear that no black-market effects come close to offsetting the benefits of reduced consumption from taxation. Also, taxes/price are not the primary determinant of black market (<a href=\"https://www.cgdev.org/sites/default/files/CGD-Policy-Paper-62-Savedoff-Alwang-Best-Health-Policy-Tobacco-Tax.pdf\">Savedoff citing others, 2015</a>).<ol><li>We could imagine a situation where the effects of the black market would not conform to those studies e.g. 300% price hike in a state with no import controls. However, I don\u2019t think an EA tobacco taxation, or any other serious tobacco control org, would put itself in that position.</li><li>I think the concerns about black market effects are gonna be consequential, not in the worthiness of the intervention, but in which state to pursue. For example, we know that two variables that affect the prevalence of black market is the price differential between bordering states and how effective a state\u2019s import controls.</li><li>If I had more time, I\u2019d write about the value of getting these laws on the books in countries in SSA that are weaker states (but will hopefully develop state capacity over time) whilst tobacco companies aren\u2019t as focused there and before these get a new generation hooked like they have in other emerging markets e.g. SE Asia</li></ol></li><li>So if I understand you right, disentangle tobacco deaths from things that can be double counted like a smoker that died from COVID, which might get marked in both camps?</li><li>Yah I hear you on this. The GWWC number is exciting, but the intervention should be proven on a DALY standard, which I think it has notwithstanding someone finding a big hole in it.</li><li>I am not sure what you mean by this one. If you mean concern about it being a regressive tax, then I\u2019d agree (more so than the black market concern) that this should be in a CEA. However, I again don\u2019t expect it to drastically change the cost-effectiveness. Poorer people are more price sensitive and disproportionately reap more benefits from reduced consumption due to taxation than wealthier classes. I think the <a href=\"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16959391/\">Liu 2006 study</a> observes what is intuitive to us all\u2014tobacco consumption increases poverty across a society.<ol><li>If you are talking about the economy in general, then you\u2019d need to elaborate more. Aside from tobacco being a substantial strain on the economy, the taxes on it generate great revenue for poorer governments.</li><li>Case study: Columbia tripled their tobacco tax from 2016 to 2018 and over that time consumption of tobacco fell by a third and their national health service doubled its funding with that tax.</li></ol></li></ol><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I realize these thoughts were not as quick as I planned.
