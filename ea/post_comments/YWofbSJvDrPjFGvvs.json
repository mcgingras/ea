Neither Israel nor Egypt wants to let Palestinians out of Gaza, and no country wants to accept them as refugees.  So for both sides, \"having a nice place to live\" is a key issue.</p>\n<p>I'm very sympathetic to anyone who wants to lead a safe and prosperous life.  I'm not as sympathetic to anyone who insists that their people deserve a particular chunk of territory for historical or religious reasons.  Fulfilling some sort of historical or religious purpose seems near the top of Maslow's hierarchy of needs, and I don't think people should be causing others to suffer so they can fulfill such a purpose.</p>\n<p>I find myself wondering if both Jews and Palestinians would be better off if they weren't living right next to each other.  <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/12/15/opinion/israel-palestinians-arabs-jews.html\">It seems as though</a> the dynamic illustrated in the <a href=\"https://ncase.itch.io/wbwwb\">We Become What We Behold</a> browser game has been playing out in Israel/Palestine for many decades, and I don't see how to stop that cycle once it's started.</p>\n<p>Milton Friedman once said:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Only a crisis - actual or perceived - produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes the politically inevitable.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Up until now, the idea of charter cities has existed somewhat on the fringe, but I'm wondering if it's an idea that's lying around which could be helpful.</p>\n<p>It so happens that one of the world's only chunks of unclaimed land, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bir_Tawil\">Bir Tawal</a>, lies south of Egypt.</p>\n<p>My wild idea is: Israel strikes a deal with Egypt, Sudan, and the local Bedouins to create a Palestinian state there, hires international firms to build the area up with buildings and transport links, and creates a corridor for Palestinians willing to relocate out of Gaza.</p>\n<p><strong>The pitch for Israel</strong> is: This allows you to invade Gaza/isolate militants with fewer IDF soldiers and Palestinian civilians dying.  It could even be cheaper financially.  It achieves a way better humanitarian outcome.  And it ends the cycle of radicalization.  Every Palestinian who moves to Bir Tawal is a Palestinian who is less likely to be radicalized into Hamas during the invasion, and a Palestinian who can't easily storm your border wall or fire a rocket into Israel.</p>\n<p><strong>The pitch for Gazans</strong> would focus on improved quality of life.  Bir Tawil is 4x as large as the Gaza Strip, so there's more room.  Israel should subsidize the new state for the first X years of its existence, e.g. through a basic income.  To make sure Israel follows through with its promise, signatories to the Abraham Accords could pledge to break off relations with Israel anew if the funds don't come through.  Signatories could also supervise the process of Gazan relocation to ensure no human rights abuses.  The threat of breaking off relations with Israel would ensure a good relocation experience.</p>\n<p><strong>The pitch for the rest of the world</strong> is reducing the risk of a great power conflict, e.g. between the US and Iran.  Perhaps you could involve Saudi Arabia in the idea if you can persuade them that weakening Hamas will weaken Iran.  Saudi Arabia has a <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/model-city-monday-8122\">demonstrated interest</a> in creating futuristic new cities in the middle of nowhere.</p>\n<p><strong>Alternatively, from an immigration policy perspective</strong>: Israel could just pay other countries to accept Gazan refugees.  The IDF has an annual budget of $10-20 billion USD.  There are about 2 million people in Gaza.  So on a napkin it seems reasonable for Israel to pay, say, $10K USD per Gazan to any country willing to give any number of Gazans permanent residency.  That $10K would break down into transportation funds, funds for the destination country's government, and funds for the emigrant Gazan to find their feet in a new country.  (Presumably militants will have trouble getting permanent residency, but they'll probably want to stay behind anyways.)</p>\n<p>What do you think of these ideas?  I'm fairly ignorant about this conflict so I assume my ideas have major holes.  (If they <em>don't</em> have holes, I encourage someone else to grab them and run with them, since I'm focused on AI alignment.  I don't have a platform to signal boost stuff, nor do I have thoughts on the best messaging strategy.

However, we can't predict with confidence which heuristics will work, and working heuristics are liable to degrade over time as terrorists figure out how to game them.</p>\n<p>Therefore, instead of trusting the government to tell the difference, imagine if any citizen could post an \"immigration bond\" for an immigrant Gazan -- analogous to a bail bond.  Perhaps the bond would be $100K or something like that.  If the immigrant Gazan commits a serious crime or terrorist attack, the person who posted the bond loses the entire amount.  If the immigrant Gazan becomes a productive member of society, perhaps the person who posted the bond would be entitled a fraction of the income tax revenue they generate for the government, if that tax revenue exceeds the amount of money the immigrant receives through government programs.</p>\n<p>I'm imagining this bond program working via two channels:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Personal relationships.  If my cousin is in Gaza and I believe she just wants peace, I post a bond so she can come to my country and live peacefully.  If she ever gets tempted to commit a terrorist attack, I remind her that I stand to lose $100K if she does so, and it wouldn't be right to betray a family member like that.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Financial speculators.  Imagine a hedge fund doing a bunch of research and data analysis, conducting interviews, trying to figure out the best predictors of terrorism in order to invest in immigration bonds and receive income tax revenues.  Same with financial markets, over time the best speculators make more money and increase their influence on the market, as they're able to figure out how to separate Group 1 from Group 2 effectively.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n", "parentCommentId": "kRhh6DTAiCotDGyTR", "user": {"username": "chinscratch"}}, {"_id": "9PvmrD9bqobhfkXq9", "postedAt": "2023-10-19T05:17:37.072Z", "postId": "YWofbSJvDrPjFGvvs", "htmlBody": "<p>I totally disagree with this suggestion. Forcing the resettlement of Palestinians out of their homeland to Egypt with no regard for Egyptian sovereignty raises the question of how to prioritize the sovereignty of one country over the other. Second, it violates all ethical and international norms by taking indigenous inhabitants out of their homeland. Third, this is not a solution, this is basically moving a problem to another country that has nothing to do with its start, and here I want to support David Manheim\u2019s perspectives on the current events (check his comments on your thread). And even from a utilitarian point of view (Although it\u2019s not the most suitable argument for the current situation), resettlement outside the Israeli/Palestinian territories will only cause more causalities, &nbsp;because, by involving the host country (Egypt), you\u2019re basically risking the lives of 100 million Egyptians to save less than 10 million Israelis, and it won\u2019t save Palestinian either especially if the current apartheid Netanyahu government remained. Although resettlement is not the best solution in my opinion (and here again I assert to check &nbsp;David\u2019s proposition), theoretically, if Palestinians have to move, the most realistic option would be the Negev desert, given it\u2019s within the Israeli territory so they can assure and control its security status, and around 25% of its population are Arab Bedouin so Palestinians could be easily integrated there until Israel finishes up with Hamas in Gaza&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": "riayLZmTcaywdbfKv", "user": {"username": "Zainab Asal"}}, {"_id": "wieLgTJJp9w5tcmEQ", "postedAt": "2023-10-19T05:48:09.042Z", "postId": "YWofbSJvDrPjFGvvs", "htmlBody": "<p>Given your experience with the IDF, and your current work in EA Isreal.

I didn't meet any of them who wanted this conflict to continue. They all want to live a peaceful life. And there is actually a space to establish cooperative dynamics between them. For example, many Palestinians find that the labor market in Israel is much better than in Palestine ( Better salary and compensation). On the other side, labor jobs in Israel are actually benefiting from hiring Palestinians to cover their needs for labor workers, from my experience in speaking with several Palestinians they are more in need within construction and agriculture. The big problem is making it easier for Palestinians to get work permits in Israel. If this process can be made simpler, it could help bring people closer together and meet the demand for workers in Israel..

Therefore, the assertion that the authority is paying a handsome salary for every Israeli killed is far from the truth and such claims should be treated with more caution.
