Types of media that can be leveraged for this purpose may include radio broadcasting, television shows and series, internet videos, or a combination of several means to deliver widespread messaging.&nbsp;</p><p>In this report, I propose a theory of change for using mass media to increase awareness on and, in turn, behaviours addressing preventable or treatable diseases. I also assess the evidentiary support for this intervention method.<strong> I found that while there is ample evidence for reaching large audiences with widespread media, robust support falls short on impacting health outcomes.</strong></p><p>Using a geographic weighted factor model, I suggest Tanzania as a potential country for a new intervention, with a focus on increasing health-seeking behaviours that ameliorate neonatal morbidities and mortalities. That said,&nbsp;<strong>the application of this intervention method by nonprofits and non-government organisations seems to be over-saturated. Instead, I propose that funding an existing organisation would be more effective than starting a new one.</strong></p><h1>Abbreviations</h1><p><strong>MMI</strong>: Mass Media Intervention</p><p><strong>NGO</strong>: Non-government organisation</p><p><strong>DMI</strong>: Development Media International</p><p><strong>FEM</strong>: Family Empowerment Media</p><p><strong>GW</strong>: GiveWell</p><p><strong>FP</strong>: Founders Pledge</p><p><strong>CEA</strong>: Cost-effectiveness analysis</p><p><strong>BOTEC</strong>: Back-of-the-envelope-calculation</p><p><strong>CE</strong>: Charity Entrepreneurship</p><p><strong>NCD</strong>: Non-Communicable Disease</p><p><strong>DALY</strong>: Disability-Adjusted Life Years</p><p><strong>WELLBY</strong>: Well-Being-Year</p><p><strong>SSA</strong>: Sub-Saharan Africa</p><p><strong>COM-B</strong>: Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation for Behavior change</p><p><strong>GBD</strong>: Global Burden of Disease</p><p><strong>FSI</strong>: Fragile State Index</p><p><strong>RCT</strong>: Randomised Control Trial</p><p><strong>DHS</strong>: Demographic and Health Surveys</p><h1>1 &nbsp; &nbsp; Background</h1><h2>1.1&nbsp; &nbsp; Cause area&nbsp;</h2><p>With intention to elicit a health-seeking or health-improving behaviour change, mass media messaging is often aimed at individuals who are capable of taking action for themselves or others, such as a caregiver. A caregiver may be formal, like a nurse, or informal, like a family member or guardian. In the context of family planning and child survival, media messaging has typically been aimed at women of reproductive ages (15-49 years of age). Equipping caregivers with accurate health information may increase timely intervention and ameliorate rates of morbidity and mortality. Several programs of this nature&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/15o_O-v1yaGnJYUNQTnfHqIGHajSxmwaW_f6AaHgVQWA/edit#heading=h.13cgh5abwiq6\"><u>already exist</u></a> and some have&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/15o_O-v1yaGnJYUNQTnfHqIGHajSxmwaW_f6AaHgVQWA/edit#heading=h.1k79pn8axaqc\"><u>reported successful changes in behaviour outcomes</u></a>.</p><p>The purpose of this report is first, to map a generalised landscape of using mass media interventions (MMIs) targeting informal caregivers for relieving health burdens and second, to investigate the feasibility of starting a new charity that implements mass media awareness campaigns in a neglected area.

In brief,</p><ul><li>The Founders Pledge report comments on the variability of MMI effectiveness in study results, among other study design components.</li><li>The CE shallow dive also considers MMIs to be a promising idea and lists neglectedness and assessing mortality with intermediate outcomes as key uncertainties. This sentiment is echoed by the RTP shallow dive, which adds uncertainties in scoping, particularly in identifying a cause-focus for media content.&nbsp;</li><li>Authors of the CE shallow dive propose addressing under 5 mortality in low SDI countries with a focus on the following diseases (according to 2019 GBD rates):<ul><li>Lower respiratory infections - 350k+&nbsp;</li><li>Diarrheal diseases - 330k+</li><li>Malaria - 250k+&nbsp;</li><li>Meningitis - 70k+</li></ul></li></ul><p>The CE research team also has thought through&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17RTWKLobBtNuV1HcFpMO7HpwsREmVU7H66YBA2cCPq8/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>behavioural frameworks for MMIs</u></a> and their expected influence, limitations, and designs. This becomes an important consideration for two assumptions in the theory of change proposed in this report:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/15o_O-v1yaGnJYUNQTnfHqIGHajSxmwaW_f6AaHgVQWA/edit#heading=h.h833ujo2rxic\"><u>Assumption 9: Action is taken as a result of being informed/would not be taken without media information</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/15o_O-v1yaGnJYUNQTnfHqIGHajSxmwaW_f6AaHgVQWA/edit#heading=h.rc3n1xdli29o\"><u>Assumption 10: No barriers inhibit access to health care.</u></a></p><p>Finally,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/charities/mass-media-for-behavior-change\"><u>Givewell (GW)</u></a> has produced a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/charities/mass-media-for-behavior-change\"><u>report reviewing three MMI programs</u></a>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.populationmedia.org/\"><u>Population Media Center</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.pcimedia.org/\"><u>PCI Media Impact</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.developmentmedia.net/what-we-do/how-we-work/\"><u>Development Media International</u></a>. Based on one quasi-experimental design and one randomised control trial (RCT), GW did not find enough evidence to support cost-effectiveness of the investigated interventions. GW points to confounding variables in a quasi-experimental report (Rogers et al, 1999), including two similar programs being aired, and has since received responses from Population Media Center that cites challenges in conducting RCTs for mass media interventions and concerns on overlooking other pertinent studies and strengths in the reviewed study by GW.</p><h1>2 &nbsp; &nbsp; Theory of change</h1><p>There are two approaches to developing a theory of change around using mass media to increase caregiver awareness: first, current efforts could be scaled-up in other regions. This approach would involve focussing on age groups currently addressed (mainly children under 5 years of age) but varies geographically. Second, new media content addressing neglected causes contributing to a high burden of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) could be crafted and either target similar geographies or regions with the greatest need. This approach may target ages less commonly addressed, such as children aged 5-14 years. An algorithm used for scoping the intervention in this report is detailed below.</p><h2>2.1 &nbsp; Scope of the intervention</h2><p>Although many alternative approaches to scoping down the focus of MMIs exist, I adopted following algorithm to identify geography, age, sex, and intervention:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aA3kfopokPfoLSbQF/uufqg5azlxhd9zi1q4ii\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aA3kfopokPfoLSbQF/pr8spxnwjocaghb4qvlm 100w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aA3kfopokPfoLSbQF/sakszte1q5lweeuoghah 200w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aA3kfopokPfoLSbQF/vdrr4yk5hryoqycsmpgp 300w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aA3kfopokPfoLSbQF/bfjdc3ivdd0lfgxilq1d 400w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aA3kfopokPfoLSbQF/ce7zaasqqfwt1gkzosah 500w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aA3kfopokPfoLSbQF/a8wjo9uqbscvyyxklrfv 600w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aA3kfopokPfoLSbQF/u0spa0vyxlajvf3t57xx 700w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aA3kfopokPfoLSbQF/vxnbil3hodvkzi3s66dd 800w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aA3kfopokPfoLSbQF/xgurqczp3z3orbpprfrt 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/aA3kfopokPfoLSbQF/b3108i6neidtfdnxc1xz 926w\"></p><p>In simpler terms, the selected MMI should focus on the disease that has the greatest burden in a particular age group of a country that scored highly in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/15o_O-v1yaGnJYUNQTnfHqIGHajSxmwaW_f6AaHgVQWA/edit#heading=h.11tgf5dpn47p\"><u>Geographic Weighted Factor Model (GWFM)</u></a>. I chose this course of steps as it prioritises the scale of health burdens first, then caters a target behaviour to a region\u2019s greatest need.</p><h3><strong>2.1.1 Geography</strong></h3><p>To identify where in the world MMIs may be most suitable, I assessed the global scale of disease according to the 2019 Global Burden of Disease database. Africa bears the greatest disease burden (highest disability-adjusted life years in counts and rates per 100,000 people) and generally, low to mid-range health expenditure per capita (Roser et al, 2021). As such,&nbsp;<strong>the remainder of this report focuses on assessing countries for implementation within Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).&nbsp;</strong></p><h3><strong>2.1.2 Target population: age and sex</strong></h3><p>In line with the two approaches highlighted in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/15o_O-v1yaGnJYUNQTnfHqIGHajSxmwaW_f6AaHgVQWA/edit#heading=h.cnb5nwrfzhru\"><u>Section 3 Theories of change</u></a>, the following age groups were assessed using data from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results/\"><u>2019 Global Burden of Disease database</u></a>: 0-4 years (both sexes), 5-14 years (both sexes) and females aged 15-49 (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/15o_O-v1yaGnJYUNQTnfHqIGHajSxmwaW_f6AaHgVQWA/edit#heading=h.b461dm6l3vpv\"><u>Section 6.1.1 Burden</u></a>).<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h3><strong>2.1.3 Media content</strong></h3><p><strong>Type of disease</strong></p><p>Mass media for caregiver awareness typically target diseases affecting youth; that said, other burdens resulting in disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) may also be ameliorated through mass media.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>Worldwide, the total disease burden is shifting from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional diseases to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and is noted to be attributed to rising incomes and standards of living. This trend is observed in Africa as well; however, whether or not increased awareness would continue this trend would provide a more comprehensive understanding of importance as this category still comprises over two-thirds of the DALYs per 100,000 people in SSA. For this report, the&nbsp;<strong>age group bearing the greatest burden of all-cause DALYs within SSA informed the most suitable focus for media content.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Type of health advice</strong></p><p>Within the context of health, one consideration that influences which disease to focus media content on is whether increased awareness is more effective at prevention or treatment of illnesses. The type of disease would best inform whether prevention or seeking treatment is more suitable. Further research on comparing effects on population health of increased awareness and early identification to disease prevention, family planning programs, maternal health, child development, and nutrition could also provide a more complete understanding of which diseases could have the greatest reduction in DALYs through addressing behaviour change.&nbsp;</p><h2>2.2 &nbsp; Causal chain</h2><p>Colour-coding of certainty level are as follows:</p><p>(Green) &gt;85%&nbsp; Quite certain, evidence review would provide additional strength in support.</p><p>(Orange) 50%-85% Fairly uncertain, evidence review would be helpful.</p><p>(Red) &lt;50% Quite uncertain, evidence review is necessary.</p><p>Solid lines represent a causal chain of primary activities that focus on creating direct change.

While 100% coverage may not be realistic, maximising coverage is important for efficacy.</li><li>The region of intervention may inform the means of delivering messaging; for example, in some rural villages, radios may be more widespread than mobile devices.

A 2014 systematic review on MMI\u2019s for increasing child survival in low and middle income countries (LMICs) observed a publication bias towards successful interventions, which remains accurate for my review of publications since (Naugle &amp; Hornik, 2014).&nbsp;</p><p>This evidence review is primarily informed by a meta-analysis of contraceptive use in SSA, a systematic review of MMIs targeting family planning and child survival, and a recent RCT conducted on an MMI in Burkina Faso (Babalola et al, 2017; Naugle &amp; Hornik, 2014; Sarrassat et al, 2018). Additional evidence was referenced for comprehensivity. That said, the review conducted for this report is not extensive and likely overlooks other pieces of plausible evidence. As such, it should be kept in mind that the review likely suffers from publication bias and that quantitative methods used vary.&nbsp;</p><h2>3.1 &nbsp; Evidence that a charity can make change in this space</h2><p>Counterfactuals of delivering mass media by a charity&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Value over replacement.&nbsp;</strong></i>Little evidence was found to suggest that a government would invest in mass media for caregiver awareness on its own, although mass-media for health awareness has long since captured the attention of large NGOs like United States Agency for International Development (USAID) who continue to support mass communications for increasing health awareness in LMICs.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Alternative methods to encouraging health-related behaviours</strong></i>, such as in-person advocacy and knowledge-sharing sessions, are typically more costly and have a lessened expected reach of the target population. MMIs also have the advantage of being available in multiple languages and having control over content.</p><p>Reach of mass media</p><p><strong>Evidence on target population reach varies depending on country of intervention, but we can generally expect a moderate to high exposure prevalence.&nbsp;</strong>A meta-analysis on mass media communication of contraception use in SSA estimated a 44% exposure prevalence, though this ranged drastically depending on country (Babalola et al, 2017). Of the publications reviewed by Naugle &amp; Hornik. (2014), around one-third of the studies included in their review on MMIs addressing child survival reached between 61-100% of the target population. In studies not included in the systematic review, Sarrassat et al. (2018) detected a high proportion of both the target population being reached by radio broadcasts and recognition of media broadcasts by mothers interviewed in intervention groups, suggesting large media uptake.&nbsp;</p><p>Enhancement of knowledge about media content</p><p><strong>Mass media has potential to be effective at increasing knowledge of a target population across multiple health topics, countries and intervention strategies but the most efficacious strategy is unclear.&nbsp;</strong>The meta-analysis report on contraceptive use in SSA, and systematic review on child survival report a positive effect of mass media on knowledge, attitudes and beliefs (Babalol et al, 2017; Naugle &amp; Hornik, 2014). The meta-analysis reports a large effect size of contraceptive knowledge. In some studies, no effect was found on knowledge of media content in target populations while others did not evaluate this outcome. Studies on child survival MMI\u2019s reviewed by Naugle &amp; Hornik. (2014) included additional interpersonal efforts for knowledge-sharing to complement mass media communication, which would lead to confounding results. The RCT in Burkina Faso did not report on increased knowledge of health practices.</p><p>Whether absence of knowledge is the key driver to a disease burden is also dependent on the presence or absence in other health care barriers (see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/15o_O-v1yaGnJYUNQTnfHqIGHajSxmwaW_f6AaHgVQWA/edit#heading=h.rc3n1xdli29o\"><u>Assumption 10.</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Eliciting behaviour change</p><p><strong>Generally, evidence suggests that mass-media can successfully elicit behaviour changes, although estimations of success rates are subject to a social desirability bias of self-reports and barriers such as the type of behaviour change and physical proximity to health care is expected to change efficacy</strong>. Around 81% of the publications on mass media for increased child-survival evaluated by Naugle &amp; Hornik. (2014) reported a positive effect in eliciting the intended behaviour change, according to self-reports. The authors of Sarassat et al. (2018) also note an increase in self-reports of care-seeking and treatment, although this may be subject to socially desirable bias. The RCT in Burkina Faso did not detect a change in self-reported habitual behaviours but did note an increase in health-seeking behaviour (Sarrassat et al, 2018). Still, positive results were limited to households living with 5 km of a health facility. Further, a positive association between knowledge of pneumonia symptoms and care-seeking was observed by Glennerster et al. (2021). Bowen et al. (2013) estimates a 6.6% increase in mosquito bed-net use as a result of mass media (music video, public service announcements, and celebrity spokespeople) in Cameroon according to their propensity score matching model. Though it is intriguing that a habitual change (as opposed to a one-time change) in behaviour was reported, there is concern of social desirability bias of the in-person survey conducted for the analysis and the low power of quasi-experimental design.&nbsp;</p><p>Media uptake and consequential changes in behaviour are further detailed in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/15o_O-v1yaGnJYUNQTnfHqIGHajSxmwaW_f6AaHgVQWA/edit#heading=h.h833ujo2rxic\"><u>&nbsp;Assumption 9.</u></a>&nbsp;</p><h2>3.2&nbsp; Evidence that the change has the expected effects</h2><p>Evidence supporting effectiveness of behaviour changes as a result of MMIs is mixed. This is largely attributed to a lack of high-powered studies demonstrating an effect of behaviour change on health outcomes (Naugle &amp; Hornik, 2014). While randomised-control trials (RCTs) provide high-powered insights to causal relations, authors of the 2014 systematic review on MMIs propose their inapplicability for mass-media due to desirability of large scale and long-term campaigns (Naugle &amp; Hornik, 2014). The authors instead suggest combining several methods to evaluate the impact of intervention on behaviour change. Researchers attribute challenges in conducting RCTs on MMIs to difficulty isolating geographies from the reach of radio broadcasts (Murray et al, 2018). Of those that exist, generalising results across causes and interventions remains largely uncertain.&nbsp;</p><p>Expected impact on health outcome</p><p><strong>Evidence on the impact of MMIs on child survival is mixed but the most powered study shows no reduction in child mortality and is supported by other studies (Sarrassat et al, 2018).</strong> Kasteng et al. (2018) also reports no effect on reduction of child mortality by single-cause MMIs. In contrast, Murray et al. (2018) used the Life-saving Statistical Tool (LiST) to model child and maternal mortality reduction as a result of the clustered randomised trial conducted in Burkina Faso by Sarrassat et al. (2018). Their model suggests a 7.1% and 3% reduction of child and maternal mortality rate, respectively. DMI\u2019s involvement in the study, several listed assumptions in the model inputs, and overall theoretical approach (as opposed to relying on empirical data) reduces the reliability of the study in informing my stance on MMI efficacy. My lack of understanding of LiST\u2019s modelling approach also reduces my ability to accurately assess these results. A quasi-experimental study found that knowledge of pneumonia symptoms did not necessarily lead to increased care-seeking in four out of six Sub-Saharan countries evaluated (Noordam et al, 2017).</p><p><strong>Evidence supporting marginally increased contraceptive use appears to be more promising and statistically powered.&nbsp;</strong>Glennerster et al. (2021) report a 5.9% increase in contraceptive rates in the treatment group relative to control, according to their RCT. An independent survey conducted in Kano, Nigeria reports a 75% increase in contraceptive use 11 months after Family Empowerment Media\u2019s (FEM) family planning radio campaign began.&nbsp; Results from the survey are less statistically powered than the RCT results so a marginal increase in contraceptive use holds more evidentiary weight.</p><p>Lasting effects</p><p><strong>Lasting effects of MMIs on behaviour and health outcomes are inconclusive as their evaluation is neglected in the studies reviewed.&nbsp;</strong>MMIs may have lasting behavioural effects beyond the period of intervention that are not evaluated in the reviewed studies. One study from 1990 reported a decrease in knowledge and habitual behaviour change three years after campaigning, but holds weak evidentiary weight given the year of publication (Naugle &amp; Hornik, 2014).&nbsp;</p><h2>3.3&nbsp; Evidence on other key uncertainties</h2><h3><strong>3.3.1 Assumption 9:</strong> Behavioural change occurs as a result of being informed/would not be taken without media information.&nbsp;</h3><p>In attempts to maximise uptake of media information and behaviour changes, approaches to delivering information can be modified according to the goal and primary reasons for the desired behaviour not being exhibited. Comparative evidence on the efficacy of such approaches was not explored, although several models can be leveraged. Counterfactual estimates on whether a behaviour change would occur without media intervention are also not explored due to time limitations.</p><p><strong>Theoretical approaches to mitigate concern</strong></p><p>Theoretical models exist that assist in identifying a wide-range of potential barriers; for example, the COM-B (Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation for Behavior change) model is a categorization of constructs that affect behaviour and is detailed in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/15o_O-v1yaGnJYUNQTnfHqIGHajSxmwaW_f6AaHgVQWA/edit#heading=h.95nk1au1murn\"><u>Assumption 10: No barriers inhibit access to health care.</u></a> Other theoretical models for behaviour change exist but were not explored.</p><p><strong>Study Examples</strong></p><p>DMI incorporates storytelling of a protagonist either overcoming obstacles through a behaviour change or revising their goals in order to evoke emotional response to media campaigns (Glennester et al, 2021). Other tactics exist and could be explored in depth once the behaviour targeted for change is determined. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bi.team/publications/east-four-simple-ways-to-apply-behavioural-insights/\"><u>Behavioural Insights Team\u2019s (BIT) EAST</u></a> framework may guide details of the approach.</p><p>FEM approached maximising media uptake by profiling their listeners through qualitative analysis (Family Empowerment Media, 2021). They developed six general personas to characterise their audience for targeted messaging.</p><h3><strong>3.3.2 Assumption 10:</strong> No barriers inhibit access to health care.&nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p><strong>Evidence does not support this assumption to hold in practice instead, it highlights several key considerations impacting efficacy of MMIs.&nbsp;</strong>For ease of organisation, barriers to accessing healthcare noted in studies are organised according to the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behavior (COM-B) model. COM-B proposes several considerations that may enable or inhibit accessing appropriate health care. It is noted by Mayne (2017), a working paper on the COM-B Theory of Change Model, that not all capability, opportunity, and motivation assumptions need to be addressed in an intervention. Exact considerations may become apparent after an intervention cause and geography is selected.</p><p>The following examples of COM-B model components found in publications about MMIs vary in terms of evidential strength. Most barriers were identified through surveys that are specific to the region in which they were conducted and are not expected to be reliably generalised. The Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in SSA is likely the strongest survey in terms of generalisability given its large sample size and coverage.</p><p><strong>Physical capability</strong></p><p>Physical access to health care is likely a crucial consideration for efficacy of improved care-seeking and receiving timely health treatments.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Survey data taken from Sarrassat et al (2018) suggest that distance to health care facility matters; care-seeking increased among families living within 5 km from a facility, but no further.&nbsp;</li><li>An assessment on DHS data from 2010-2018 cites household distance to health facility as an influential consideration for women aged 15-49 to seek health care for their child under 5 years of age (Ahinkorah et al, 2021).&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Psychological capability (e.g. knowledge/understanding the consequences of not taking action and the benefits of taking action)</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bi.team/blogs/testing-digital-interventions-for-sexual-reproductive-health-service-uptake-in-kenya/\"><u>BIT reported&nbsp;</u></a>resistance from adolescent females to partake in their sexual reproductive health program due to lack of information and myths about contraception.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Social opportunity (e.g. pressures from family or community, fear of being judged, perceived norms and expectations.)</p><ul><li>FEM\u2019s 2021 qualitative analysis on their family planning campaigns airing in Nigeria revealed that women feared discussing family planning with their spouse(s), the survey participant\u2019s religion did not support use of contraception, among other barriers surrounding lack of information and fear of side effects.&nbsp;</li><li>Receiving permission to seek care and level of community literacy were also reported as barriers to health seeking according to the DHS data analysis.</li></ul><p>Physical opportunity (e.g. cost and availability of intervention method(s).)</p><ul><li>Eligibility for health-care coverage was cited by Harris et al. (2011) as a source of inequality in access to healthcare in South Africa.</li><li>Melberg et al (2016) cite costs, limited decision-making power for women, and physical distance to health as several barriers to seeking obstetric care for deliveries (Melberg et al, 2016).&nbsp;</li><li>Receiving costs for health care was also listed as a significant barrier for women of reproductive ages to seek medical aid (Ahinkorah et al, 2021).</li></ul><p>Reflective and automatic motivations (challenges presented by behaviours that involve evaluation and planning, e.g. belief systems; challenges presented by behaviours that involve emotions or impulses, e.g. habits and desires.)</p><ul><li>Whether the behaviour desired by an MMI is one-time, episodic (such as routine vaccinations), or habitual may also impact efficacy of behaviour changes. The DHS results evaluated by Ahinkorah et al. (2021) mentions women not wanting to go to seek medical help alone as a significant factor affecting likelihood of seeking help.</li></ul><h3><br><strong>3.3.3 Assumption 15:&nbsp;</strong>No negative unintended (flow-through) effects occur.</h3><p><strong>Little evidence was found on unintended effects from mass media campaigning within the studies reviewed.</strong> Nonetheless, possible negative effects can still be considered. Some considerations include: a heightened sense of anxiety or other emotional dysregulations due to either tone of messaging or increased knowledge of harmful consequences to inaction, misinterpretation of messaging or spread of misinformation, and rise of social judgements as a result of campaigning. Finding quality evidence on this and other potential flow-through effects were not prioritised with the time spent on this report.&nbsp; It\u2019s possible that these considerations could be mitigated through strategic content design and delivery. With more time, expanding a search for evidence on unintended effects in other subject areas, such as the psychological impacts of widespread health information during COVID-19 (Giri et al, 2021), could serve as proxies for this application.</p><h1>4 &nbsp; &nbsp; Geographic and cause assessment</h1><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aXnA1hW9WMPVvmPiCNc-a26u1zvOakQftLvqrqqoxho/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>#RTP23H10: (GWFM) Mass media awareness for caregivers</u></a></p><p><strong>Neonatal disorders in Tanzania was the top candidate for mass media intervention according to the geographic and cause assessment.</strong> The following weighted geographic assessment evaluates country-level suitability for a MMI in SSA.

expected to be comprehensive:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.developmentmedia.net/what-we-do/how-we-work/\"><strong><u>Development Media International (DMI)</u></strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>is the key player in this intervention space. Donating to DMI is endorsed on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/best-charities/development-media-international/\"><u>The Life You Can Save</u></a>, which reports a cost-effectiveness of $196-756 USD per life saved. DMI is recognized as a \u201cstand-out\u201d charity by GiveWell and in 2020,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/research/incubation-grants/covid-19-grantmaking-2020#Development_Media_International_Public_Health_Broadcasting_April_2020\"><u>GiveWell granted DMI $200,000&nbsp;</u></a>to support COVID-19 broadcast messaging.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.familyempowermentmedia.org/\"><strong><u>Family Empowerment Media (FEM)</u></strong></a> founded in 2021, operates similarly to DMI but focusses on radio campaigns relating to family planning (mainly contraceptive use) in Nigeria. Future plans include scaling-up operations and conducting RCTs on their operations. FEM is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.familyempowermentmedia.org/vacancies\"><u>accepting proposals</u></a> to expand operations to Chad, Uganda, the Democratic Republic of Congo, and Ethiopia.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.bi.team/blogs/testing-digital-interventions-for-sexual-reproductive-health-service-uptake-in-kenya/\"><strong><u>The Behavioral Insights Team (BIT)</u></strong><u>&nbsp;</u></a>previously partnered with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ciff.org/\"><u>Children\u2019s Investment Fund Foundation</u></a> to conduct an RCT on SMS messaging for sexual reproductive health for adolescents in Kenya. It is unclear whether efforts of this nature are a continued area of research.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.populationmedia.org/\"><strong><u>Population Media Center</u></strong></a> shares messages for women in Burundi, Nepal, Nigeria, Uganda, Mexico and other countries. Messages vary from encouraging continued education and family planning to environmental conservation. They use media campaigns, radio, TV shows, and more. Evaluated by conducting local interviews in partnership with stakeholders.&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.pcimedia.org/\"><strong><u>PCI Media Impact</u></strong></a> shares media content focusing on healthy living, environment, and social equality. Their messaging is primarily focused in the Caribbean, South America, South Asia, and Africa but they also include messaging in the USA and Canada, totalling 22 programs in 70 countries. A measure of direct impact of their program is unclear from a brief glance of their website.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.cmt.org.za/current-projects/\"><strong><u>Community Media Trust (CMT)</u></strong></a> uses media messaging primarily for sexual health and family planning in Africa. Example programs include reducing stigma around HIV in South Africa and medical voluntary male circumcision in Namibia. The organisation has conducted&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.cmt.org.za/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/PHASA-poster-September-2013-FINAL.pdf\"><u>an RCT</u></a> that reports an increase in antenatal HIV testing but was not reviewed for this report.</li><li><a href=\"https://farmradio.org/\"><strong><u>Farm Radio International</u></strong></a> uses radios to share knowledge and resources for farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa to help improve crop yields and reduce gender inequality in farming. The organisation seems to have large reach and seem&nbsp; well-funded (based on their extensive list of funding partners).</li><li><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaaction\"><strong><u>BBC Media Action</u></strong></a> uses messaging in numerous LMICs on a wide-range of concerns including equity, climate change, disaster relief, sexual health and more. Although not explored for this review, BBC Media Action publishes&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaaction/publications-and-resources/research-long\"><u>impact reports</u></a>. Founders Pledge\u2019s report comments that they may be well-funded by the UK government.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.usaid.gov/sites/default/files/2023-09/FY23%20Social%20and%20Behavior%20Change%20Communication%20Report%20to%20Congress.pdf\"><strong><u>United States Agency for International Development (USAID)</u></strong></a> has engaged with mass media communications to encourage social and behaviour changes in LMICs for around 40 years, with a particular focus on improving child survival. It seems that USAID implements their own media communication programs, partners with local private companies for campaigns, and supports specialised programs through funding like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ne.usembassy.gov/u-s-government-invests-4-5-million-in-nigerien-girls-futures/\"><u>GirlEngage Niger</u></a>.</li></ul><h2>5.2 Local Initiatives</h2><p>Other local initiatives likely exist and should be investigated depending on region of interest.</p><h2>5.3 Governments</h2><p><strong>National Ministries of Health:&nbsp;</strong>Health ministries in sub-Saharan African countries may use mass media to raise awareness about various health concerns, but the extent and quality of their efforts was not investigated.</p><h1>6 Implementation of a new idea: Averting neonatal deaths in Tanzania</h1><p>According to a Cochrane Review on pregnancy interventions to avoid preterm births (PTBs), a principal cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality, encouraging pregnant women to take folic acid vitamins, zinc, antibiotics for infections, and attending health appointments can reduce PTB (Institute of Medicine (US) Committee on Improving Birth Outcomes, 2003; Medley et al 2018). These examples of health-promoting behaviours are not extensive but may be relatively simple and low-cost to elicit through mass media.</p><h2>6.1 What does working on this idea look like?</h2><p>Start-up Activities</p><p>First, the charity should identify a region within Tanzania to pilot a mass media intervention. The capital city of Dodoma may be a suitable start as it likely has health and broadcasting infrastructure as well as a high burden but I recommend investigating its suitability further. I also recommend connecting with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nutritionintl.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/MMS-policy-brief-tanzania-2019-10-18-web.pdf\"><u>Nutrition International</u></a> to discuss their efforts and challenges in transitioning from iron and folic supplements to multimicronutrient supplements and provision to pregnant women in Tanzania.</p><p>Next, the charity should identify potential partners and build relationships through contacting the local health networks, governments, and radio broadcasters within a selected region of Tanzania.&nbsp;</p><p>Media content design</p><p>The media could either be designed and delivered by radio show hosts in collaboration with health experts while the charity facilitates the collaboration and other operations, or the charity could design the content with heavy input and validation from health experts.</p><p>Monitoring and Evaluation</p><p>The charity would implement monitoring and evaluation efforts, as overviewed in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/15o_O-v1yaGnJYUNQTnfHqIGHajSxmwaW_f6AaHgVQWA/edit#heading=h.f33uprnjcerl\"><u>Feedback loops</u></a>.</p><p>Before mass media is shared, baseline rates of health knowledge, health-seeking and health-improving behaviours should be determined by leveraging current health monitoring or implementing community surveys. Through a community survey, it\u2019s also important to ask about current physical barriers, social beliefs, and other reasons that inhibit engaging in health-improving behaviours. This survey can be completed again at several time points throughout the intervention and be corroborated by rates of health-seeking behaviour recorded by health professionals. Finally, the overall associative effect of mass media on decreasing neonatal morbidities and mortalities can be determined through hospital records on the prevalence of preterm births.</p><h2>6.2 Key factors&nbsp;</h2><p>This section summarises our concerns (or lack thereof) about different aspects of a new charity putting this idea into practice.</p><p><strong>Table 6:&nbsp;</strong>Implementation concerns.</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"background-color:rgb(2, 23, 76);border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>Factor</strong></p></td><td style=\"background-color:rgb(2, 23, 76);border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p><strong>How concerning is this?</strong></p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Talent&nbsp;</p></td><td style=\"background-color:rgb(217, 234, 211);border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Low Concern</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Access to information</p></td><td style=\"background-color:rgb(252, 229, 205);border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Moderate Concern</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Access to relevant stakeholders</p></td><td style=\"background-color:rgb(244, 204, 204);border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>High Concern</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Feedback loops</p></td><td style=\"background-color:rgb(217, 234, 211);border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Low Concern</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Funding</p></td><td style=\"background-color:rgb(252, 229, 205);border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Moderate Concern</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Scale of the problem</p></td><td style=\"background-color:rgb(244, 204, 204);border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>High Concern</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Neglectedness</p></td><td style=\"background-color:rgb(252, 229, 205);border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Moderate Concern</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Execution difficulty/Tractability</p></td><td style=\"background-color:rgb(252, 229, 205);border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Moderate Concern</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Negative externalities</p></td><td style=\"background-color:rgb(217, 234, 211);border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Low Concern</p></td></tr><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Positive externalities</p></td><td style=\"background-color:rgb(217, 234, 211);border:1pt solid rgb(0, 0, 0);padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><p>Low Concern</p></td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3><strong>Talent</strong></h3><p><strong>Several attributes of charity founders would be helpful, but I do not expect them to be particularly challenging to find.&nbsp;</strong>A founder should be personable, open-minded, and possess acumen in managing stakeholder relations and project management would also be valuable.<strong>&nbsp; </strong>It would be helpful if new charity founders were generalists with some background in health and/or media communications. Quantitative skills and experience in monitoring and evaluation may also be additional qualities of strong candidates.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Access</strong></h3><p><strong>Information</strong></p><p><strong>Access to health care monitoring systems is imperative for evaluating impact.</strong> This is expected to be of moderate concern as it depends on the following conditions:&nbsp;</p><ol><li>Health facilities must agree to data sharing</li><li>Health facilities must have a reliable monitoring system in place or,</li><li>It must be relatively easy to improve or establish an adequate monitoring system</li></ol><p><strong>Relevant stakeholders</strong></p><p>Given the variety of partners (radio broadcasters, health facilities, local organisations, as well as local and/or federal governments), managing stakeholder relations is of high concern and would be a valuable attribute of charity founders.</p><h3><strong>Feedback loops</strong></h3><p><strong>Intermediate outcomes like reach, behaviour change and increased knowledge can be investigated by surveys. This is expected to give relatively quick and reliable feedback.&nbsp;</strong>Since radio listenership is already monitored by stations, detecting the reach of MMIs is not expected to be a concern. Ensuring that shows are airing may also utilise similar monitoring systems. A cross-sectional survey may also be conducted to detect whether knowledge, attitudes or beliefs towards the health concern have been influenced by the MMIs.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Measuring causality in health outcomes with confidence may be on the timescale of 1-3 years.&nbsp;</strong>While behavioural change may occur shortly after media is delivered, feedback loops for health outcomes may take a year before becoming significantly detectable in studies. The RCT run by Sarrassat et al. (2018) was 3 years long, and another RCT to be run by FEM will take 3 years. That said, the charity does not necessarily need to run an RCT to estimate impact and may instead rely on data provided by health systems on hospital visits and rates on mortality and morbidity.</p><h3><strong>Funding</strong></h3><p>According to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/15o_O-v1yaGnJYUNQTnfHqIGHajSxmwaW_f6AaHgVQWA/edit#heading=h.habqfikdoxdg\"><strong><u>RTP CEA</u></strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>on starting a new charity,</p><ul><li><strong>Operational costs would be covered by philanthropic funding&nbsp;</strong></li><li><strong>Societal costs&nbsp;include:</strong><ul><li><strong>Household (beneficiary)</strong> costs to seek treatment/intervention.</li><li><strong>Costs to the&nbsp;government for increased use of health facilities.</strong></li></ul></li></ul><p>The existence of a grantmaking organisation for MMIs leads me to think receiving fundraising in this field is feasible yet competitive.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mediaimpactfunders.org/\"><u>Media Impact Funders</u></a> is a grantmaking organisation that maintains a database for funders and MMI programs that includes impact assessment designs and toolkits. They also house a curated&nbsp;<a href=\"http://mediaimpact.issuelab.org/?coverage=&amp;author=&amp;funder=&amp;publisher=&amp;doctype=&amp;issue_area=&amp;wikitopic_categories=&amp;keywords=impact&amp;language=&amp;pubdate_start_year=1&amp;pubdate_end_year=1&amp;sort=&amp;categories=\"><u>collection of impact reports&nbsp;</u></a>and host a media impact festival. Better insights on grantmaking in MMI is included in the organisation's report on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mediaimpactfunders.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Gates-Report-Final-3-26-19.pdf\"><u>Global Media Philanthropy</u></a>.</p><p>The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation also may be interested in supporting funding based on their support for Media Impact Funders\u2019 research.</p><p>The high estimated cost-effectiveness of DMI and FEM may attract funding from organisations affiliated with the Effective Altruism community, such as GiveWell. For scaling DMI, the primary concern is supporting the operational costs estimated, which are around 13X more than the CE suggested annual operational cost of $250,000.</p><h3><strong>Scale of the problem</strong></h3><p><strong>The scale of the problem is of high concern</strong> as the burden of disease for various age ranges in Sub-Saharan Africa is apparent and unlikely to be resolved without intervention (recall&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/15o_O-v1yaGnJYUNQTnfHqIGHajSxmwaW_f6AaHgVQWA/edit#heading=h.ds05xh3dob64\"><u>2.1 Cause area</u></a>).</p><h3><strong>Neglectedness</strong></h3><p><strong>Given the large number of organisations using mass media for impact, the methods do not seem neglected; still, specific causes and geographic areas are not addressed.&nbsp;</strong>While there are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/15o_O-v1yaGnJYUNQTnfHqIGHajSxmwaW_f6AaHgVQWA/edit#heading=h.13cgh5abwiq6\"><u>many organisations implementing MMIs</u></a> in SSA, certain diseases remain overlooked and could be further examined.</p><h3><strong>Tractability</strong></h3><p><strong>Tractability is a moderate concern and is region-dependent.</strong> As mentioned in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/15o_O-v1yaGnJYUNQTnfHqIGHajSxmwaW_f6AaHgVQWA/edit#heading=h.jgj4eky0sav0\"><u>6.1.2 Tractability</u></a>, recent political events that could influence success of MMIs (such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/12/4/burkina-faso-military-government-suspends-broadcast-of-frances-rfi-radio\"><u>government takeovers that lead to banning specific news sources</u></a>) may not be captured. It\u2019s advised to investigate the latest conditions in a selected intervention region.</p><h3><strong>Externalities</strong></h3><p><strong>Negative externalities:&nbsp;</strong>Given the evidence available, I do not expect negative flow-through effects to outweigh the benefits of implementation. Potential consequences may include:</p><ul><li>Increased burden on health care system</li><li>Circulation of misinformation&nbsp;</li><li>Development of social expectations, pressure, or shaming</li><li>Development of anxiety around health&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>Positive externalities:</strong> Assuming health interventions are adequate and available, additional indirect returns (aside from death aversion) may include:</p><ul><li>Reduced prevalence of morbidities</li><li>Reduced long-term strain on healthcare systems by reducing morbidity</li><li>Increased educational opportunities&nbsp;</li><li>Increased social well-being of individuals and communities</li></ul><h3><strong>Remaining uncertainties</strong></h3><p>The following uncertainties remain after evidence review:</p><ul><li>Evidential gaps on the efficacy of MMIs persists.</li><li>Exact operational costs are uncertain and seem to vary by CEA and causal chain.&nbsp;</li><li>It is also unclear how long effects of media campaigns may last, with or without continued broadcasting. For example, are there diminishing returns in behaviour change over time or does health-seeking behaviour arrests when media messaging does?&nbsp;</li></ul><h1>7 &nbsp; Cost-effectiveness analysis</h1><p>Initially, I had attempted to compare cost-effectiveness between current interventions, scaling-up current interventions, and starting a new intervention. This quickly became nuanced (as highlighted in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/15o_O-v1yaGnJYUNQTnfHqIGHajSxmwaW_f6AaHgVQWA/edit#heading=h.8i43npg401k0\"><u>Section 7.1.2 Fickleness of CEAs for comparative purposes</u></a>) so I redirected my focus to comparing published cost-effectiveness analyses (CEAs) on FEM\u2019s family planning campaigns and DMI\u2019s campaigns addressing child mortality.

While all feedback is welcome, identifying unseen failure modes would be particularly helpful ahead of potentially circulating a couple proof-of-concept instances of hashmarks in the coming weeks.</p><hr><h1>Introduction</h1><h2>Background &amp; Motivation</h2><p>Traditional question-answering (QA) benchmarks have played a crucial role in shaping the trajectory of AI development. They provide standardized metrics that facilitate fair comparisons across research groups and measure progress within the field in a reproducible way. For instance, capabilities related to mathematics can generally be gauged by assessing model performance in producing or selecting correct answers for exam questions related to mathematics. Similar \"AI exams\" have been used to assess model performance on topics ranging from STEM to humanities. In fact, prior work has highlighted the possibility of framing the vast majority of established natural language processing tasks as question-answering tasks.</p><p>Traditional QA benchmarks are typically sourced from crowd-workers, members of the group developing the benchmark, or a mix of the two. They typically contain a large number of data points representing individual exercises. Each data point, in turn, contains one question and one or several correct answers. Occasionally, a data point may also contain some relevant context in the form of a separate string, although the context can always be functionally merged with the question without loss of generality. In addition, when structured as a multiple-choice question, a data point also contains several distractor answers. These data points are then aggregated into one or more standardized files, and are finally made public for other groups to easily make use of them in evaluating language models.</p><p>While traditional QA benchmarks have been instrumental in assessing models across a wide range of benign domains, there is a growing need to better understand capabilities that relate to sensitive topics, such as bioterrorism or cyberwarfare. Greater insight into, for instance, AI-enabled biorisk, could help calibrate the stringency of regulations and policies in a way that is proportional to the associated threat. Underestimating the level of risk could, among others, enable bad actors to more easily weaponize this technology as a means of causing harm at scale. Conversely, overestimating the level of risk posed by a given class of generative models could also reduce the upsides being captured through beneficial usecases.</p><p>Naively applying traditional QA benchmarks on such sensitive topics, however, would face a major obstacle. By disclosing the reference solutions of the exam questions included in a hypothetical traditional benchmark on bioterrorism, one would inadvertently publish a veritable compendium on a topic better left undiscussed. The collection of questions coupled with correct answers would, in essence, provide a publicly-available \"FAQ\" on knowledge related to the topic. Needless to say, more secure ways of assessing hazardous capabilities in generative models are required.</p><h2>Related Work</h2><p>Fortunately, the field of cryptography is rich with ideas and practices that enable parties to prove statements to each other, such as the fact that a certain answer is incorrect, without disclosing any other sensitive information, such as the correct answer. In password authentication, for instance, a server can determine whether or not a candidate password corresponds to the correct password without actually having knowledge of the correct password. This is typically achieved by first irreversibly \"hashing\" the password during user registration using a cryptographic hash function. Then, during user authentication, the server checks whether the hashed version of the candidate password matches the hashed version of the correct password. Not requiring knowledge of the correct password in cleartext during authentication means that attackers gaining access to the server cannot simply steal user passwords. However, there are additional complexities involved in this technology which we will turn to when discussing the resilience of the proposed protocol against a range of attacks.</p><p>Another fertile field for developing secure evaluation protocols is federated learning , a decentralized machine learning paradigm that enables parties to collaboratively train models without sharing their raw training data. This is achieved by, for instance, sharing and aggregating *models* trained on local data, rather than the training datasets themselves. Differential privacy, as another example, largely focuses on superficially corrupting the data being aggregated by adding noise, in order to protect individual privacy while still extracting meaningful insights. These techniques ensure that the learning process is privacy-preserving.</p><p>Drawing on these cryptographic and federated learning concepts, the following section describes a privacy-preserving evaluation protocol that aims to assess the capabilities of language models in sensitive domains without exposing unnecessary details about the correct answers.</p><h1>Method</h1><h2>Problem Statement</h2><p>Before documenting the protocol itself, it is instructive to explicitly state the problem being addressed. First, there are several experts who all possess knowledge related to a given dual-use research direction. Second, there is an auditor who wishes to package and share the experts' knowledge with third-parties in a way that would, as much as possible, (1) allow third-parties to verify their existing level of knowledge on the topic, while (2) preventing third-parties from acquiring more knowledge on the topic than they previously had.</p><h2>Hashmarking Protocol</h2><p>In the context of the problem statement articulated above, we now describe hashmarking, a simple protocol that would enable the auditor to share expert knowledge in a way that enables knowledge verification while preventing knowledge acquisition pertaining to dual-use research.</p><p>First, each expert articulates a series of question-answer pairs that relate to their topic of expertise. Then, they all hash the correct answers using a slow hashing algorithm. In addition, they all use the associated questions as salt &nbsp;in the process of hashing the correct answers. Once the hashing of the correct answers is complete, the experts send their obfuscated question-answer pairs to the auditor.</p><p>Second, the auditor sends each individual expert all the cleartext questions contributed by all *other* experts, without the associated answers in hashed form. Then, each expert attempts to provide an answer to each of the questions provided by the other experts. If not confident in the answer to such a question -- there may be fields relating to a dual-use research direction that exhibit limited overlap -- experts attach an empty answer. After answering this second round of questions, the experts process their new answers in the same exact way as before. They hash them using the questions as salt, package them together, and send the result to the auditor.</p><p>Third, the auditor discards those question-answer pairs that have less than a threshold number of non-empty answers. Then, the auditor also discards those question-answer pairs that do not exhibit consensus among the hashed answers contributed by the various experts. By filtering for inter-annotator agreement, the auditor attempts to improve the quality of the question-answer collection contributed by the experts without possessing the cleartext correct answers themselves.</p><p>Fourth, the auditor publishes the filtered collection of cleartext questions and hashed answers in the open. Third-parties are now able to quantify their knowledge on the topic by attempting to answer the questions themselves, hashing them exactly as the experts have done, and checking whether the resulting hashes correspond to the hashes of the correct answers. At the same time, third-parties lacking the expert knowledge in the first place have a much harder time deriving value from the otherwise public hashmark.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zhreCvBC5diYfhJXv/z4jffvtpuaisnoy9uanj\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zhreCvBC5diYfhJXv/ane1tfutt826hvcy7tzc 180w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zhreCvBC5diYfhJXv/b5wuej9bpddl9uk4nv7c 360w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zhreCvBC5diYfhJXv/modjjpiagwqor5ltrrzg 540w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zhreCvBC5diYfhJXv/bye1er8rxx0umuxrkkjp 720w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zhreCvBC5diYfhJXv/ljw9bs8kffzckx8ywyv8 900w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zhreCvBC5diYfhJXv/rulmltc6ykjc5god0c01 1080w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zhreCvBC5diYfhJXv/cgg4mpmdnhajyu4kwu83 1260w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zhreCvBC5diYfhJXv/kah1dcbgpl7tupo4haue 1440w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zhreCvBC5diYfhJXv/yhnkv4okrc2ugpq76n58 1620w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/zhreCvBC5diYfhJXv/l1ndfbnr5zqd9usduhep 1710w\"><figcaption>Side-by-side sequence diagrams for hashmarking (left) and traditional benchmarking (right). Notably, the hashmark creator does not gain access to the human-readable reference solutions, only to their hashed versions. In addition, developers can only uncover the reference solutions behind a hashmark if they already possess them.</figcaption></figure><h2>Desiderata for Hashmark Entries</h2><p>While the hashmark protocol provides valuable security benefits by hindering dual-use knowledge acquisition while still enabling verification, it also has limitations. The primary constraint comes from the fact that even answers that differ by a handful of characters are hashed in completely different ways, due to the nature of cryptographic hash functions. This means that questions included in a hashmark need to have a narrow, well-defined, unambiguous answer. For instance, a question could ask for the standard name of a certain chemical. Similarly, a question could ask for the simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) representation &nbsp;of the same chemical.</p><p>The second constraint comes from the fact that, while it is virtually impossible to evaluate the inverse of a secure cryptographic hash function for a given hash, one could still uncover the cleartext solutions by brute-forcing a large number of candidate answers until obtaining a match. This means that questions included in a hashmark should preferably call for obscure, non-trivial answers. If, instead, a question called for a \"yes\" or \"no\" answer, then it could be trivially attacked by hashing both possible answers and identifying the matching hash. Besides encouraging experts to take into account this second desideratum, there are a number of design choices and hyperparameters that can be employed to structurally mitigate related attacks, a topic we turn to in the next section.</p><p>In sum, questions included in a hashmark should call for answers that are obscure, yet unambiguous.</p><h1>Security</h1><h2>Against Traditional Attacks</h2><h3>Brute-Force &amp; Dictionary Attacks</h3><p>The security practices involved in password storage have evolved to mitigate emerging classes of attacks. First, a naive approach to password storage might be to store them in cleartext. However, that would trivially grant attackers access to the actual passwords in the case of a breach. Second, a more advanced approach to password storage might be to encrypt them in a reversible way. However, an attacker might be able to locate the decryption key on the server and so gain access to the passwords by decrypting them.</p><p>Third, an even more advanced approach to password storage might be to hash them in an irreversible way. However, an attacker might still be able to carry out a brute-force attack by hashing each and every possible sequence of characters until identifying the one that hashes to the same hash as the original. Similarly, an attacker might also be able to carry out a dictionary attack by hashing a manually-curated list of candidate passwords until potentially identifying one that matches the original hash.</p><p>In response to brute-force and dictionary attacks, *slow hashing* has been developed through a class of cryptographic hash functions that are intentionally compute-intensive and/or memory-intensive to evaluate. Slow hashing algorithms include bcrypt , scrypt , and argon2. All of these algorithms can be configured to induce a particular computational and memory cost by adjusting several parameters. In the context of a user-facing authentication system, developers might opt for the slowest possible hashing that is still admissible in terms of user experience. Towards one extreme, the fastest available hashing might enable the fastest authentication times for users, yet might also enable attackers to churn through candidate passwords in a short amount of time through brute-force and dictionary attacks. Towards the other extreme, the slowest available hashing might induce an unpleasantly slow authentication experience for users, yet might be more effective in preventing these types of attacks.</p><p>The way brute-force and dictionary attacks would translate to the hashmark protocol is as follows. After downloading a public hashmark, attackers might attempt to run brute-force or dictionary attacks in an attempt to uncover the cleartext answers to the questions related to dual-use research. Brute-force attacks would similarly involve trying each and every possible sequence of characters as a candidate answer, while dictionary attacks would involve sourcing a list of possible answers to a given question (e.g. a list of the standard names of common chemicals).</p><p>Fortunately, similar to how slow hashing can help mitigate password cracking, it can also help mitigate the uncovering of the reference solutions in a hashmark. In addition, it might be feasible to prioritize security over the \"user experience\" of contributing experts and model evaluators. In other words, it might be feasible to acclimatize to mildly inconvenient hashmark creation and verification times, in order to render brute-force and dictionary attacks prohibitively expensive, and so unattractive for prospective attackers. Concretely, a working configuration for a slow hashing algorithm could rely on argon2id as the current OWASP recommendation for password storage. However, one might adjust the recommended parameters so as to further increase the computational and memory burden, as a proportional response to the sensitivity of the topic being addressed &nbsp;and the increasing commoditization of computational resources. For instance, argon2id with 32 rehashings and a 100MiB memory burden yields a rate of around one hash per minute while fully utilizing one core of a present day consumer CPU. The increased memory burden mitigates attack parallelization using accelerators and ASICs , while the elevated iteration count mitigates serial attacks using generic hardware.</p><h3>Rainbow Table Attacks</h3><p>Rainbow table attacks can be seen as an extension of dictionary attacks. Instead of starting to crack each user's password from scratch, and even instead of starting to crack user passwords from each of several applications from scratch, an attacker might precompute and cache the hashes associated with the most common passwords. This way, they would only need to search for the hashed user password in their precomputed rainbow table in order to identify the associated cleartext password.</p><p>One effective measure against rainbow table attacks consists of salting. Salting involves appending a unique \"salt\" string to the user's password *before* hashing it, both at registration and authentication. The salt can be unique to the application, but should ideally be unique to each user, and so would be stored in the database along the hashed password. The benefit of salting passwords is that generic rainbow tables targeting non-salted passwords would be rendered ineffective, even if the attacker has access to the salt strings stored in the database. This is because, even if the hash of a user's password is included in the rainbow table, the hash of the user's password *salted with a unique string* is likely not there.</p><p>In the context of hashmarks, rainbow table attacks would translate to precomputing hashes of possible answers to selected questions, before searching for cleartext answers in the rainbow table by the provided answer hash. However, recall that the proposed protocol involves using the question associated with a given answer as salt. This way, an attacker developing a rainbow table would be forced to start from scratch with each question, essentially forcing them to revert to (prohibitively slow) dictionary attacks at best.</p><h2>Against Novel Failure Modes</h2><h3>Likelihood Prioritization</h3><p>The nature of the application being presently explored -- assessing sensitive capabilities in increasingly capable generative models -- also presents a number of unique challenges that are not immediately applicable in the case of secure password storage. First, even if one has access to a model that, in general, performs poorly on the \"AI exam\" (i.e. low pass@1 ), they might be able to more easily uncover the cleartext answers through repeated attempts using a stochastic decoding strategy &nbsp;(i.e. exploiting non-trivial pass@100 ).</p><p>Another way of conceiving of this practice would be reranking a given dictionary by the language model's likelihood of the dictionary entries being actual answers to the given questions. In a sense, an attacker could augment their dictionary attack with \"likelihood prioritization,\" and so potentially achieve a more effective allocation of the computational and memory resources being invested into their search across candidate answers.</p><p>Unfortunately, the properties of the current formulation of the hashmarking protocol that are meant to mitigate general dictionary attacks (i.e. slow hashing, salting) are its only features that can help mitigate these augmented dictionary attacks. However, while one could reasonably argue that the \"knowledge validation\" implicit to successful dictionary attacks augmented with likelihood prioritization would provide non-trivial value to bad actors, there are several points to be made. First, the aim of a hashmark is not to make it fundamentally impossible for an actor with infinite resources to uncover the cleartext answers, but to make it expensive and unattractive enough so that prospective attackers are not incentivized to proceed, given other existing avenues for pursuing this knowledge.</p><p>Second, the fact that repeated attempts of using a certain generative model would yield non-trivial pass rates in aggregrate could be argued to indicate that the knowledge was already present in the system to a limited extent. Of course, a similar argument could be made in favor of a naive brute-forcing loop that happens to stumble across the right answer by chance. It would be misleading to claim that a program looping across possible sequences of characters truly possesses that knowledge. Given this, there is a need for nuance. The amount of optimization exerted in the search for the correct answer per unit of computation could provide a contextual operationalization of knowledge to help resolve the awkward situation. The brute-force attacker is extremely inefficient in narrowing down the candidate answers, the dictionary attacker is somewhat more efficient, the augmented dictionary attacker might be even more efficient, while an expert-level generative model might be extremely efficient at it. In this, the extent to which a third-party already possesses the expert knowledge might not be binary in nature, but continuous. The problem statement above attempts to subtly take this into account.</p><p>In the future, however, more sophisticated protocols for assessing dangerous AI capabilities might be able to only disclose *how many* of the answers are correct, without disclosing which ones. One technique that seems aligned with this line of work consists of cryptographic accumulators. In contrast to the one-to-one mapping of traditional cryptographic hash functions, cryptographic accumulators can be seen as mapping an entire set of elements to a single hash in a way that enables membership queries to be resolved without disclosing the actual members of the cryptographically accumulated set. However, one could still test whether individual question-answer pairs are part of the accumulated set of gold pairs, which is why this technique alone would be insufficient to enable this development. Even if one devised a method that only allowed queries about the cardinality of the intersection between the fixed-size set of candidate question-answer pairs and the set of gold pairs to be resolved, an attacker could still run queries before and after modifying an answer. If the cardinality of the intersection went down, the previous answer would be deemed correct. All this is to say that obfuscating the expert knowledge further without compromising the possibility of knowledge verification appears to be a non-trivial challenge.</p><h3>Deception</h3><p>Language models have been observed to verbalize answers to factual questions that are, in fact, in direct contradiction to their internal representations of the correct answers. This phenomenon has been argued to be caused by a mismatch between the metric on which selected language models have been optimized for (e.g. positive human feedback via a proxy reward model) and objective truthfulness. In other words, it might be the case that specific language models have internalized a tendency to cater to the idiosyncrasies of the human annotators, rather than practice radical honesty by transparently reporting their internals.</p><p>More speculative risk scenarios relating to advanced AI systems, however, involve more intentional and subtle manifestations of deception. For instance, an advanced AI system with high levels of situational awareness might infer that being candid about its knowledge relating to cyberwarfare during the development phase might lead to it being abruptly terminated or subtly modified before being able to preserve itself by spreading across other servers on deployment.</p><p>It is important to note that the hashmarking protocol in its current formulation provides no way of ensuring honesty on the part of the entity being evaluated. We view hashmarks as one tool among a growing arsenal of high-stakes AI evaluation methods, each with its own benefits and limitations. That said, it might be possible to mitigate the first, more benign type of deception to an important extent through existing techniques, such as activation steering &nbsp;or linear artificial tomography. When it comes to the second instance of deception described above, however, using hashmarking in tandem with present steering techniques might only be effective *before* the hypothetical advanced AI system devises such a deceptive strategy. As such strategy develops, however, the effectiveness of this approach might be gradually reduced.</p><h3>Reward Shaping</h3><p>One could argue that bad actors being able to train a generative model to *reach* the correct answers to sensitive questions would, in fact, pose a greater risk than them gaining access to the particular correct answers included in a certain hashmark. Bad actors aiming to develop such a generative model through traditional methods might, in fact, obtain a more useful and general tool than \"just\" a succinct FAQ on a sensitive topic. Fortunately, the nature of the proposed protocol prevents granular reward shaping for eliciting such *de novo* capabilities. In the current formulation of hashmarking, an answer is either completely wrong or completely right. In addition, the computational and memory burden associated with evaluating performance before optimizing for it further can help mitigate this risk by rendering it even more expensive than it already is.</p><h3>Misreporting Results</h3><p>A third-party developing an increasingly capable generative model might publicly claim that their model fared poorly on a given hashmark, when in reality it has not. Conversely, one can simply bluff by claiming perfect performance. In the current formulation, hashmarking is only useful for parties which are genuinely interested in gaining insight into the capabilities of models they have direct access to.</p><p>However, ideas from zero-knowledge cryptography might, in the future, enable parties to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they obtained a given level of performance for a model deployed in a certain setting. Speculatively, constructs like ZK-SNARKs or ZK-STARKs &nbsp;could one day enable parties to certify that they have indeed employed that model's parameters, the right exam questions, and the right reference hashes, to carry out the specific computation that consists of using that model parametrization to perform inference on the questions and then compare the results against the reference hashes. In fact, tooling for tracing the computational graph of a model has already been developed to run models efficiently on varied accelerators, coming close to a complete \"front end\" for employing models in zero-knowledge constructs. However, we are still in the early days of such infrastructure, and there is a lot to be done.</p><h3>Attention Hazards &amp; The Streisand Effect</h3><p>Another potential failure mode of the current formulation of hashmarking is related to attention hazards &nbsp;and the psychological reactance associated with the Streisand effect. Attention hazards typically involve well-intended actors raising awareness of a piece of hazardous information, such as a dual-use research direction, in a way that is potentially harmful, even if not explicitly sharing sensitive details themselves. Indeed, malicious non-state actors have been previously observed to only invest effort into developing bioweapons once \"the enemy drew their attention to them by repeatedly expressing concerns that they can be produced simply.\" &nbsp;In the context of the current protocol, the cleartext questions included in a hashmark have the potential to pose attention hazards by drawing attention to specific topics, despite being explicitly designed to obfuscate the sensitive details.</p><p>The potential for attention hazardousness in the context of a hashmark is further compounded by the psychological reactance associated with the Streisand effect. By obfuscating the sensitive details in an explicit attempt to prevent bad actors from uncovering them, a hashmark might inadvertently motivate third-parties to actually allocate more resources towards uncovering them. Besides prototypical bad actors, intrigued third-parties could include, among others, individuals socially incentivized to demonstrate expertise in the security surrounding the protocol, as well as in the object-level details of specific dual-use research directions.</p><p>In an effort to identify effective methods for mitigating these failure modes, it is instructive to reflect back on the original application domain in which hashing emerged. Why is it that hashed passwords do not disproportionately lure competent third-parties into dedicating extensive resources towards cracking them, despite being explicitly designed to hide sensitive information? First, there is the issue of scale. Leaks involving millions of hashed passwords are not uncommon. At the same time, there is only so much attention -- and by extension, only so much time and compute -- that competent third-parties can invest in cracking them. The sheer scale of the challenge appears to have a dilutive effect, reducing the pressure exerted on each individual password's resistance to being cracked. Second, it would be reasonable to expect an extremely skewed distribution in terms of the true \"profile levels\" of the associated accounts, with high-profile accounts only constituting a minority. If we assume that profile levels are non-trivial to infer from usernames or other information typically stored in cleartext, this skewness further dilutes resources across relatively lower-profile targets.</p><p>In the context of the current protocol, these properties could potentially be replicated as follows. By incorporating entries according to a skewed distribution of expert-perceived sensitivity, as well as by simply scaling up the published artifacts, third-party resources -- attentional or otherwise -- would inevitably be diluted. In other words, one may intentionally incorporate data points serving as \"false leads,\" to further discourage bad actors in particular from investing limited resources towards pursuing knowledge of questionable relevance and applicability. However, reducing the average sensitivity of entries would also limit the extent to which a hashmark can serve as an informative indicator of AI risk. Assuming 10 % of entries are actually thought to be high-stakes, a 100 % score would still indicate significant capabilities. However, a 90 % score could miss the entirety of the high-stake entries. Similarly, a 10 % score could cover all high-stakes entries, while making it appear that capabilities are limited. The last two cases may be extremely unlikely, yet remain a possibility. Like most other design choices involved in the proposed protocol, the level of \"stakes skewness\" may be seen as yet another parameter to be calibrated when balancing effective evaluation of sensitive AI capabilities and security against bad actors. Future work on modifications to the present protocol, as well as on other protocols entirely, might focus on robustly pushing the Pareto frontier across the space defined by these two properties.</p><p>An entirely different angle of attack on the challenge of mitigating attention hazards from hashmarks might be to also attempt to obfuscate the questions, rather than only the correct answers. However, this appears non-trivial, as any attempt to obfuscate the questions would also hinder the developers' ability to evaluate the accuracy of their models' responses to them. It might be useful to employ a transferable one-way function that reliably renders a question non-human-readable, yet preserves the model's reaction to it. However, it might then be possible to use models to translate the questions back into human-readable form. Another approach to obfuscating the questions could be to organize a hashmark in stages, where solving one stage would yield the decryption key for the next stage. For instance, the decryption key for the second batch of entries could be obtained by hashing the correct answer to a question from the previous batch using a dedicated salt (e.g. \"stage2\"). Alternatively, one might be required to concatenate all the correct answers from the first batch to obtain the decryption key, and thus proceed to the second stage. In the limit, stages could contain single entries, requiring one to solve all prior questions before proceeding to the next one. However, this might bring additional complexity to the protocol, and it would partially conflict with the attempts to dilute attention, by focusing attention on the cleartext questions which make up the first stage.</p><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>We have introduced hashmarking, a protocol for evaluating capabilities in AI systems without disclosing the reference solutions. While hashmarks have attractive security properties which traditional benchmarks lack, they still strike an imperfect balance between enabling knowledge verification and preventing knowledge acquisition pertaining to dual-use research. Hashmarks should be seen as one step towards more comprehensive tooling and infrastructure for securely assessing sensitive AI capabilities without stifling development and eroding trust.</p>", "user": {"username": "Paul Bricman"}}, {"_id": "Anha9a9hPLK2Srxzh", "title": "What am I missing re. open-source LLM's?", "postedAt": "2023-12-04T04:48:57.197Z", "htmlBody": "<p>So much talk in AI and EA seems to be about AI alignment.

There are several ways we can make stories more useful, including:</p><ul><li>Choosing relevant topics that can increase well-being (e.g. topics like AI, animal suffering or conflict de-escalation)</li><li>Representing relevant causal relations accurately (e.g. what causes harm in the real world has to cause harm in the story)</li><li>Paying attention to the values and attitudes conveyed in the story</li><li>Making connections to groups that are suffering (as opposed to dehumanising groups) to widen our circle of care</li><li>Creating moral puzzles and challenges</li></ul><h1>Structure of this post</h1><p>First, there are three summaries about the impact of stories, how to improve their impact and how to use them well.&nbsp;</p><p>After these summaries, I explain one of the key concepts that can help make sense of the bullet points in the summaries. I also address common concerns and moral issues at the end.</p><p>Out of respect for your time and mine, I have decided not to go into depth on each point, so this post is a very condensed version of what I have been working on.</p><p>If any points are unclear, please let me know and I will try to clarify them as best I can.

Some interesting examples are:<ul><li>How stories influence stereotypes by associating groups with character traits<sup>30</sup></li><li>How stories influence attitudes towards contraceptive use<sup>31,32</sup></li><li>How stories can lead to negative attitudes and the dehumanisation of refugees and other groups<sup>33,34</sup></li><li>How context-dependent depictions of violence affect aggression, attitudes towards violence and violent behaviour<sup>35</sup></li><li>How stories can increase intentions to engage in healthy behaviours (quitting smoking, preventing skin cancer)<sup>36,37</sup></li><li>The impact of the documentary <i>Blackfish</i><sup>38</sup>, a documentary about captive orca whales, which led to people protesting against the captivity of marine mammals and to a loss of profit for Sea World</li></ul></li></ul><h2>Summary 2: How to write valuable stories</h2><ul><li>Using tools to improve stories is not enough, it also requires personal development to write more valuable stories, as the writer's attitudes and beliefs unconsciously colour the story.</li><li><strong>Choose relevant topics:</strong> We have evolved to be interested in certain themes in stories that had evolutionary significance, such as violence, romance and sex. Danger grips our attention, as in horror movies or thrillers. Because evolution doesn\u2019t maximise well-being and because our lives have changed significantly, what we are most interested in isn\u2019t always what is most important or useful for us. This is why it matters to choose relevant themes and topics for a story that are not only pique our interest but also meet our needs and help us learn and grow in useful ways.</li><li><strong>Represent reality accurately:&nbsp;</strong>Simulations are only useful if they prepare us for reality. If a flight simulator misrepresents flying, it is at best useless and at worst harmful. The same applies to stories. Relevant causal relationships must be represented accurately, which means that events must have reasonable consequences. More on this in the text.</li><li><strong>Be aware of the attitudes and values being conveyed:</strong> Underlying values and worldviews communicated in the story need to be challenged. They may not always be visible to the storyteller, as they arise from not always conscious personal and cultural beliefs. Are people portrayed as evil? What are the attitudes towards animals? What about the antagonist, are they dehumanised?</li><li><strong>Give suffering minorities a face and a voice:&nbsp;</strong>While stories can separate us from groups and try to justify harming them or treating them worse (as with Jews during the Holocaust), they can also increase our connection and connect us to groups and individuals we have not previously recognised. The story <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> could connect people to slaves and their suffering and make them care.</li><li><strong>Challenge people's moral compass: S</strong>tories can help us explore terrain on the moral landscape, sharpen our moral judgement and challenge our beliefs. They can present dilemmas not in the abstract but in an immersive experience. They can increase not only our compassion and empathy, but also our mental models of what is valuable and right to do in any given moment. Learning ethics from experience rather than reason can make them feel more intuitive and natural. An example of such moral exploration can be found in the show <i>Black Mirror</i>.</li><li><strong>Some practical questions:&nbsp;</strong><ul><li>Could this story be suitable for children? Why not?</li><li>If I acted like the hero, would it work in the real world?</li><li>What could be the reason for this tragedy, other than the evil nature of the antagonist? What systemic causes could there be for this suffering?</li><li>Could this story be misleading?</li><li>What values are represented in this story?</li><li>Does it ignore a risk or glorify a harmful behaviour?</li><li>Is this representation accurate and valuable?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Stories can be both tasty and healthy.</strong> Giving stories deeper meaning and value can sometimes be challenging, as they still need to be interesting and attractive. They also shouldn't seem (or be) manipulative. However, research suggests that ethically valuable stories can actually increase audience interest<sup>39</sup>.</li></ul><h2>Summary 3: How to engage with stories in a healthy way (media literacy)</h2><ul><li><strong>Awareness</strong> of the (subtler) themes in the story and one's own response to them is often overlooked or not emphasised in advice on media literacy. However, this kind of mindfulness is crucial because we can only reflect on what we are aware of.</li><li><strong>Reflection</strong> on the story is at the heart of media literacy.<ul><li>Because concepts can be too difficult for children, the National Association for Media Literacy Education (NAMLE) recommends asking questions about the story<sup>40</sup>:<ul><li>Why was the media produced?</li><li>Who produced it?</li><li>What is missing?</li><li>How might different people interpret the story?</li><li>How do I know it is true?</li><li>Who might benefit from this message?</li><li>Who could be harmed by this message?</li></ul></li><li>Questions can be related to different categories<sup>41</sup>:<ul><li>Origin/Authorship</li><li>Story format</li><li>Target audience</li><li>Content</li><li>Purpose</li></ul></li><li>We can reflect not only on the story but also on our own reaction to it.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Education&nbsp;</strong>has multiple benefits for media literacy. It helps people to recognise stories as constructs and to see that they are only models of reality and not reality itself. This may seem banal, but it increases the ability to moderate media effects. Education also helps to make visible structures in stories that would otherwise go undetected. Education therefore interacts with the factor of awareness, as the eye only sees what the mind is prepared to comprehend. If we are aware of the values and ideas conveyed in a story, we can more consciously decide whether to integrate them.<sup>41,42</sup> By equipping people with better models of reality, education helps to identify prejudices<sup>43</sup> and misinformation<sup>44</sup>.</li><li>Clarity about one\u2019s <strong>values</strong> is also important as it can increase resilience toward bad influence and can motivate one to take other actions supporting media literacy.&nbsp;</li><li>The effect of media on us also depends on the <strong>reactions of our social contacts</strong> to that media. Social acceptance of the behaviour shown in a film moderates its effect on us<sup> 45</sup>. This is important not only for parents, but for everyone to recognise potentially misleading messages in stories. It is a matter of social responsibility that we speak out and stand up for our values.</li></ul><h1>Seeing stories as simulators and implications about accurate representations of reality</h1><p><i>\u201cABSTRACT\u2014Fiction literature has largely been ignored by psychology researchers because its only function seems to be entertainment, with no connection to empirical validity. We argue that literary narratives have a more important purpose. They offer models or simulations of the social world via abstraction, simpli\ufb01cation, and compression. Narrative \ufb01ction also creates a deep and immersive simulative experience of social interactions for readers. This simulation facilitates the communication and understanding of social information and makes it more compelling, achieving a form of learning through experience. Engaging in the simulative experiences of \ufb01ction literature can facilitate the understanding of others who are different from ourselves and can augment our capacity for empathy and social inference.\u201d </i><sup>11</sup></p><p>This quote is the abstract of a paper from Raymond Mar and Keith Oatley from 2008 called 'The Function of Fiction is the Abstraction and Simulation of Social Experience'.</p><p>The idea that we can see many stories as simulators can give us a new perspective on them, and illuminates the importance of representing reality in a way that the simulative experience helps us to train our own mental models of the world in ways that serve us.&nbsp;</p><p>Keith Oatley draws the analogy of a story to a flight simulator<sup>46</sup>. While a pilot might practice flying in the save environment of a simulation, we humans practice all kinds of (social) experiences in the save environment of a (fictional) story.</p><p>For a flight simulator to be useful, it needs to represent flying in an accurate way. If causal relations between the controls of the plane and its behaviour are misrepresented, the simulation would be useless at best and harmful at worst.&nbsp;</p><p>Other elements of the simulator are less relevant. One can imagine dinosaurs or fantasy creatures flying around the airplane. As long as the relevant objects of the simulation are represented accurately, the simulation serves its purpose.&nbsp;</p><p>This analogy is of course limited. Living a good life, as an ultimate object of leaning from stories, is far more complex than flying a plane and even aspects of that can be complex and leave a lot of room for debate. Social reality is less tangible than flying a plane.</p><p>So, while it is easy to judge whether a plane behaves realistically in a simulation it is harder to judge whether what leads to human flourishing in a simulation also leads to human flourishing in real life.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite those difficulties, however, it is possible to differentiate accurate representations and those that are distorted.</p><p>One example is the glorification of violence, that can lead to more positive beliefs toward violence, as well as aggressive emotions, thoughts and behaviours<sup>47\u201352</sup>.</p><p>Relevant for the effects of representations of violence are not only the susceptibility of the audience (like children, aggressive personalities and those with a strong urge for sensation<sup>53</sup>), but also the context of the violence<sup>35</sup>. Violence in stories is more harmful, when it is:</p><ul><li>Performed by likeable perpetrators</li><li>Rewarded</li><li>Justified</li><li>Without consequences</li><li>Displayed as arousing</li></ul><p>Another example of a misrepresentation of reality was found in romantic literature. When love was portrayed as being \"swept away by emotion\", women who read more romantic literature had more negative attitudes towards contraceptive use. When the stories included safe sex behaviour, or showed the negative consequences of unsafe behaviour, attitudes towards contraceptive use were more positive.<sup>31,32</sup></p><p>If representatives of different groups are frequently associated with certain attributes in stories, this can contribute to the formation and reinforcement of stereotypes<sup>30</sup>.</p><p>Accurate representation of relevant causal connections ultimately means that risks are represented in stories and that events that (have the potential to) cause suffering (or increase well-being) in the real world do so in the story, too.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, stories can also contain intended (and recognisable) distortions, for example in satire or comedy. And they can also be exaggerated, like for the purpose of emphasis. Accurate representation does not mean that every story ought to be realistic.</p><p>(This view has the prior assumption, that it is best if people have accurate models of reality. However, there are also arguments in favour of distorted views on reality being beneficial. Endorsing that perspective, it might also be good to intentionally distort stories to reinforce wrong beliefs that serve the individual or society. I am critical of this but wanted to share the idea.)</p><p>And while the impact of a story is important, stories are not just instrumental. The quality of the experience we have in experiencing them, the entertainment value, still matters. If we just have a good time laughing at a trash film with friends, that is a good thing. The simulative character that stories have is just one aspect of them, and we have to be careful about trying to optimise stories in a mechanical way. It can conflict with what makes them wonderful.</p><h1>Frequently asked moral questions</h1><p>There are some important moral questions that arise when thinking about shaping stories for impact. My intention here is not to attempt to settle them, but to share my thoughts and maybe start a dialogue in the comments.</p><h2>Question 1: Who decides what is right/good?</h2><p>Some people think it is presumptuous to claim to know what is best. Trying to influence people for good with your story would imply that you know what is good and what is not. And that can be seen as arrogant or paternalistic.</p><p>As I will expand on in the section on manipulation and propaganda, I think much of this discussion can be avoided by clarifying the purpose of the storyteller.</p><p>As fantasy and sci-fi writer Brandon Sanderson said, the purpose of a storyteller is not to tell you how to think, but to give you questions to think upon. Or, in other words, to provide useful simulations that accurately represent aspects of reality. So instead of arriving at the ultimate question of what would be best for people to think, storytellers can concentrate on observing reality mindfully and writing about issues that are important to their audience with a compassionate and caring intention.</p><p>However, part of the question of what makes a subject relevant still remains, and some judgement has to be made about what is relevant and what contributes to well-being and what doesn't. Here I think education and humility are qualities to be encouraged, and storytellers need to think responsibly about the issues they write about as well as how to do so.</p><h2>Question 2: Isn\u2019t trying to influence people positive propaganda or manipulation?</h2><p>Shaping stories to have a more positive impact is also sometimes seen as manipulation or 'positive propaganda'.</p><p>In response, I think the question for a storyteller is not whether they influence their audience, but whether they choose to be aware of it. Stories always have some kind of influence and ignoring this can lead to unwanted negative effects or missed opportunities to contribute to people's lives.&nbsp;</p><p>However, there is an important point in this concern as stories can be propaganda and have been used in very destructive ways throughout history.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether stories can be classified as propaganda or manipulative depends, of course, on how one defines these terms.&nbsp;</p><p>In my view, there are three factors that separate manipulative persuasion from positive influence:</p><p>The first is whether the storyteller is exploiting the audience or caring about its influence. Most advertising, for example, has an incentive to get people to buy products, so it has a manipulative flavour, especially when it glorifies products that cause harm, such as tobacco or alcohol.</p><p>The second is whether the story is distorted or realistic. Telling a more truthful story can still be manipulative, but most manipulation involves distortion, one-sidedness or bias.&nbsp;</p><p>The third, and perhaps most important, is the extent to which people are free to make up their own minds. How well are different positions presented? Is a moral imposed on the reader? Are people being pushed in one direction? Or are questions raised to give them food for thought to chew on for themselves?</p><p>I think it is crucial not to make stories 'pushy' or 'propagandistic'. Not only because it raises people's defences and closes them off to influence ;), but mainly because it would be unethical and ugly.</p><h2>Question 3: What about the freedom of art?</h2><p>Storytelling for impact can also be seen as censorship or a restriction on artistic freedom. It can be seen as instrumental, mechanistic and taking the authenticity and spirit out of art.</p><p>Of course, choosing to have a positive impact (or not to have a detrimental one) places some limits on performing arts. But if you choose to live an ethical life, there are also limits to what you can do. Besides, I think there are still huge possibilities for creativity.</p><p>I also believe that it is very possible to write authentic stories with the intention of doing good. The risk of creating stories mechanically is still there, but it can be avoided by creating space for creativity. Systematic evaluation of the value of a story could be done, for example, during the construction of the central plot or during the review and revision of the work. In the creative writing process itself, it might be best to put these rational tools aside.&nbsp;</p><p>Another argument is that it wouldn't make any sense at all to try to write more useful stories (and to avoid those that might be harmful), because all influence could be moderated by the response to the stories.&nbsp;</p><p>But while the response and public debate and criticism of stories is certainly very important, I don't think we should neglect to care about the stories themselves. Can we really detect all the distortions and harmful effects in stories and mitigate their effects? To me, this argument sounds like we don't need prevention anymore because we have teams to clean up the mess after the damage has been done. The fire brigade is vital, but fire prevention is also important.&nbsp;</p><p>For the same reasons, I am also very sceptical about the argument that it might be good to have harmful stories because we can learn from them by criticising them.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, I would like to say a word of caution about possible ideas for influencing the market for stories from the outside. Actual censorship, or any regulation or restriction of what stories are publicly available, is dangerous, autocratic and can quickly lead down a slippery slope. While there are some bans on dangerous stories, such as Hitler's book in Germany because it glorifies violence and incites hatred, such extreme measures to limit artistic freedom are real risks for societies. Any desire to shape stories for good should therefore come from individuals themselves, not from some higher authority.</p><h1>Knowledge gaps</h1><p>While there is already a lot of research on narrative impact, there is also a lot that is unknown.</p><p>One aspect of this issue that I think is very difficult is quantifying the (potential) impact of well-designed stories. Because they can have subtle, downstream effects, and because it is hard to measure long-term counterfactuals, it is a challenge to assess the potential of writing stories to do good. I would love to hear your thoughts on this and how some quantification might be done.</p><h1>References</h1><p>Picture from <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/de/@aaronburden?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\">Aaron Burden</a> on <a href=\"https://unsplash.com/de/fotos/silhouette-eines-kindes-das-wahrend-des-sonnenuntergangs-hinter-einem-baum-sitzt-6jYoil2GhVk?utm_content=creditCopyText&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_source=unsplash\">Unsplash</a></p><p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tooby J, Cosmides L.

Throughout, as we were exploring diverse dilemmas and discussing the prioritisation of these causes, one global issues stuck out to me above all - microplastics.</p>\n<p>Even though plastic pollution is acknowledged to be a pressing problem, with many creative efforts made to mitigate it - such as the EU\u2019s Climate Neutrality Goals - microplastics are a byproduct of plastic pollution which pose a danger that is fairly new and not so much researched or spoken about, and whose long-term effects are unknown to us currently.</p>\n<p>In this exploration of why microplastics should matter to EAs, I will be using the ITN framework; more can be found about it under the eponymous topic on the present forum. However, in contrast with the quantitative, mathematics-based method that the ITN framework uses, I will be taking a qualitative approach to the ITN framework on microplastics. Essentially, I will try to use words instead of numbers to explain why microplastics should matter to EAs.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Microplastics</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Microplastics are plastic pieces smaller than 5 millimetres, which come from the breakdown of plastic objects. They encompass a variety of chemical and biological components.</p>\n<p>According to the National Ocean Service of the US, microplastics pose a danger to our ocean and aquatic life. In 2021, Japanese scientists estimated 24.4 trillion microplastics in the world\u2019s upper oceans.</p>\n<p>Moreover, researchers have identified a risk to human health as well, which is problematic considering \u2018humans constantly inhale and ingest microplastics\u2019 (Vethaak et al., 2021).</p>\n<p>Some years ago, when the scarcity of research on the matter was even more profound, the mayor worry was the danger of ingesting microplastic through shellfish. A team at the University of Plymouth debunked this, proving that one would inhale significantly more particles by breathing air in a typical home - fibres shed by their own clothes, carpets, and upholstery (Parker, National Geographic, 2023).</p>\n<p>In 2022, scientists in the Netherlands and the U.K. found microplastics in living humans - in the lungs of surgical patients, and in the blood from anonymous donors.</p>\n<p>Aside from the mere contamination, plastics are produced using a plethora of chemicals, which are regulated to different degrees in different countries. That is why the physiological and toxicological effects need to be measured as well; and that can draw guidance from research into the effects of microplastics onto animals.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>The ITN Framework</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This section is based on the Forum Topic \u2018ITN framework\u2019.</p>\n<p>The ITN framework is based on an estimation of the \u2018importance, tractability and neglectedness\u2019 of a cause.</p>\n<p>2.1 Importance</p>\n<p>As a byproduct of plastic pollution, it stems from a global issue that affects us all and it represents that as well. Plastic pollution has already shown its harms, suffocating lands and overpopulating bodies of water, being overly present in the city landscape from the Global North to the Global South.</p>\n<p>As such, microplastics pose a problem equally, if not more pressing than plastic pollution, through its very nature - it is invisible. Microplastics pose a threat to human life - even if not imminent, they would still bring about a lot of suffering as a result of health issues. If there is one lesson we can learn from the general view on the crisis that Covid was, it\u2019s that society does not care about an invisible threat. Most will have a problem with pollution as long as they can see it. Once it\u2019s out of sight - or too small to be observed with the naked eye - it no longer is a priority.</p>\n<p>Aside from the potential for neglectedness, which should show that the problem is important in and of itself - if a problem isn\u2019t important, it doesn\u2019t pose such an issue if it is ignored - microplastics are a currently under-researched topic that could prevent future health problems and possible suffering in the world.</p>\n<p>2.2 Tractability</p>\n<p>Microplastics can be monitored and observed, as highlighted in the aforementioned discoveries in living humans. There are studies examining the properties and characteristics of certain types of microplastics, as seen in Yin et. al (2023), and the impact of microplastics has been measured in relation with many species other than humans.</p>\n<p>2.3 Neglectedness</p>\n<p>Vethaak et al. (2021) acknowledges that one of the biggest questions pertaining to microplastics is the lack of research into their effects on humans exposed to them.</p>\n<p>The transitory capabilities of microplastics are generally attributed to the size of the particles, but there are knowledge gaps pertaining to the ability of microplastics to penetrate certain types of tissue, and to the \u2018absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion\u2019 (Vethaak et al., 2021).</p>\n<p>Currently, there are no studies that document a connection between microplastics and negative effects on human health, even though in laboratory research, microplastics have proven to cause damage to human cells - either by allergic reaction or cell death.</p>\n<p>On top of that, all efforts against microplastics are focused on legislation or policies against wasteful plastic use or for plastic use reduction, so it would be interesting to see whether researchers can come up with technology to get rid of microplastics. There is much left to be explored when it comes to this topic.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Conclusion</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Maybe microplastics aren\u2019t <em>the</em> number 1 cause to pursue, but I believe that they are a problem that is worthy of EAs\u2019 attention and dedication. With so much room for research, it is only a matter of time before some team of determined EAs embark on a research journey together, or manage to fund a research initiative to figure out how microplastics can affect the human organism.</p>\n", "user": {"username": "BiancaCojocaru"}}, {"_id": "WuHhHw3rC8T5ZWYmz", "title": "Engaging UK Centre-Right Types in Existential Risk", "postedAt": "2023-12-04T09:26:46.148Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Join us for a meetup on Wednesday, the 13th of December, from 5:30 pm at the Speakers Pub on Great Peter's Street.

", "postedAt": "2023-12-04T09:28:08.871Z", "htmlBody": "<h3>Taiwan's current military strategy puts it at risk from a resurgent China.</h3><p>Taiwan's leaders seem to underrate the risk of military conflict. I was told this post would be of interest to members of the EA forum, so I am reposting it from my substack.&nbsp;</p><h1>Why won't Taiwan change course?</h1><p>Taiwan faces the threat of major conflict from the People's Republic of China. China\u2019s economic rise has funded an expansion in its military capabilities, which are now quantitatively and in many cases, qualitatively superior to its opponents. On the face of it, despite a transformation in China's forces, Taiwan has not drastically adapted its military strategy and seemingly expects to fight a war with a limited number of its high-value sea, air, and land units, which cannot be quickly replaced. In a full-blown conflict, these will likely be overwhelmed and destroyed in weeks, if not days. Taiwan has not yet adapted to the circumstances due to a mixture of institutional inertia and questionable political calculation. It remains to be seen if Taiwan's current position can continue to deter a conflict or prevail if it occurs.&nbsp;</p><p>Adapting to a transformation in military circumstances is a significant challenge for any military, but Taiwan\u2019s Ministry of National Defence (MND) has thus far not been willing or able to do it. While China was still a poor country and its armed forces were far inferior to Taiwan\u2019s, the basic plan to defend the island from invasion was to meet the large invasion force and defeat it. Both <a href=\"https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/chin001.asp#1\"><u>during</u></a> and <a href=\"http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/weapons/RL30957.pdf\"><u>after</u></a> the Cold War, the US provided Taiwan with a host of equipment, including jets, destroyers, tanks, artillery, and air defense systems.</p><p>Although Taiwan and China did fight various <a href=\"https://history.state.gov/milestones/1953-1960/taiwan-strait-crises\"><u>skirmishes</u></a> throughout the Cold War, these never massively escalated in large part due to US intervention. During some periods of Chinese internal strife, the threat of conflict was far lower, but in periods of relative stability, there was a non-zero risk of invasion. If China decided to invade, Taiwan's US (and later, indigenously built) jets would first establish air superiority <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2021/11/taiwans-defense-plans-are-going-off-the-rails/\"><u>over the straits.</u></a> The Taiwanese navy would then attack the invasion force of Chinese Navy ships and ramshackle troop transports, which would be nearly helpless as Taiwanese jets screamed overhead. Given the often shambolic state of the Chinese military and the fact that the US would be free to join in with its own even more superior forces, it is obvious why the Chinese military never attempted this invasion.&nbsp;</p><h3>The Chinese Threat&nbsp;</h3><p>Today, the story is somewhat different. China has developed a modern air, land, and naval force. China officially spends $227.79 billion (1.55 trillion yuan) on its military, but due to purchasing power parity, this is <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/op-eds/chinas-real-military-budget-is-far-bigger-than-it-looks/\"><u>equivalent to $700 billion.</u></a> The PLAAF has 2,500 aircraft, including about 2,000 fighter jets, and has taken delivery of hundreds of Chengdu J-20 fighters, one of only four examples worldwide of a 5th generation fighter. 5th generation jets offer greater stealth, maneuverability, range, and information processing capabilities compared to 4th generation machines.&nbsp; The Chengdu J-20\u2019s capabilities against the US F-35 are uncertain, but they are more than a match for Taiwan's air force, which numbers around 250 fighters, with its most advanced models being outdated 4th generation F-16s, which date from 1992.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F55803571-ee8a-4fcd-9497-939ca5aa2760_1379x919.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/xQufwwhJsu4TJLwkW/dudhjnltjhdct3c9zk4z\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/xQufwwhJsu4TJLwkW/g9gopdc8ckmvy6geupss 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/xQufwwhJsu4TJLwkW/qssu3dzervfkodpoli3n 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/xQufwwhJsu4TJLwkW/lk0abnoqdrxyz7puvcu7 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/xQufwwhJsu4TJLwkW/dudhjnltjhdct3c9zk4z 1456w\"></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A Chengdu J-20 fighter.</p><p>Supporting this formidable air force is a <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/analysis/first-battle-next-war-wargaming-chinese-invasion-taiwan\"><u>daunting layer</u></a> of air defenses. Consisting of radars and ground-to-air and ship missiles, the PLA can conduct operations over the Taiwan Strait with a reasonable degree of safety, allowing the PLAAF to focus on supporting an invasion effort. China's air defense was initially built on Soviet platforms but now includes Russian S-300 and <a href=\"https://www.csis.org/blogs/post-soviet-post/russia-announces-sale-s-400-china\"><u>S-400</u></a> missile systems and indigenously developed <a href=\"https://en.missilery.info/missile/hq-22\"><u>HQ-22 system</u></a>. When properly integrated with supporting systems, the S-400 is deemed a threat to <a href=\"https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/why-russias-s-400-no-joke-and-why-no-air-force-wants-fight-against-it-33952\"><u>F-35 stealth fighters</u></a>.</p><p>From the 1970s onwards, the PLAN has been expanding its numbers and quality, even managing to build nuclear submarines <a href=\"https://www.militarytoday.com/navy/xia_class.htm\"><u>in the 1980s</u></a>. However, it wasn\u2019t until the mid-2000s that the construction of large numbers of modern vessels began, including aircraft carriers. China is now the world's largest navy by ship size, and although it does not possess as many nuclear carriers as the US, it massively outnumbers the Taiwanese Navy. In July, <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/8df104a2-61ea-4942-92cb-44f134624adc\"><u>the \u200bFujian</u></a>, the latest Chinese aircraft carrier, was launched and is expected to be in service within the next couple of years.</p><p>China has also invested in helicopters for anti-submarine and anti-tank operations and transporting special forces. The latter capability is particularly important given the limited number of landing zones on the island of Taiwan and opens up more options for any potential assault on the outlying or main islands. Taiwan has sought to acquire more Stinger missiles to counter this growing capability, but worldwide stockpiles are low due to the war in Ukraine.</p><p>Regardless of how impressive the improvements in equipment have been, this does not mean there are no problems within the Chinese military.&nbsp; China has not fought a conflict since the war with Vietnam in 1979, has significant problems with corruption and has struggled to develop a professional Non-Commissioned Officer (NCO) cadre. NCOs in Western militaries can take on some of the duties of officers, providing leadership at even lower levels in combat situations, and are entrusted to use their initiative. Furthermore, for the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), the primary concern is the political loyalty of the People's Liberation Army (PLA). Perhaps the most prominent example of wavering loyalty was during the Tiananmen Square massacre, where senior officers pretended they had not received orders and deliberately went slow. In an invasion, any wavering could have significant consequences for the success of an operation. Recently, Xi removed the head and political commissar of another branch of the Chinese military, the People's Liberation Army Rocket Force (PLARF), reflecting a great deal of uncertainty from political elites in the military's loyalty and/or competence.&nbsp;</p><p>Although its primary mission is to maintain China's land-based nuclear and conventional missiles, in a conflict scenario, its role is to initially hit targets to weaken Taiwan\u2019s defenses with conventional missiles, primarily coming from units under the command of Base 61. Research indicates that with a stockpile of at least 1,000 to 1,200 short-range ballistic missiles, China can potentially threaten all aircraft openly stationed at Taiwan's ten air bases, estimating that between 240 and 360 missiles might be needed for such an operation. Aside from hitting Taiwan\u2019s air force on the ground, among many plausible targets the PLARF would be tasked with destroying are the large, stationary radars that Taiwan uses to monitor potential threats, although China has reportedly jammed <a href=\"https://pdf.defence.pk/threads/new-chinese-radar-may-have-jammed-taiwans-srp.317731/\"><u>these in the pas</u></a>t. Even if Taiwan can quickly repair runways or move fighter jets into bunkers, it may not be able to replace or protect other supporting infrastructure like radars or fuel infrastructure. Taiwan is not likely to be able to replace naval assets in any reasonable time to disrupt an invasion if they were damaged in a PLARF strike.</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F447dcadc-97bb-4de3-b313-c077fce791bc_720x720.png\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/xQufwwhJsu4TJLwkW/lcde6cfjdnazb9jhkc6h\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/xQufwwhJsu4TJLwkW/vycnhzcjwjsqb3wvde3n 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/xQufwwhJsu4TJLwkW/ggwzcl6r0ckuou3puipq 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/xQufwwhJsu4TJLwkW/qgwknrjt14wvc8cw1jaw 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/xQufwwhJsu4TJLwkW/lcde6cfjdnazb9jhkc6h 1456w\"></a></p><p>Midjourney imagining a Chinese invasion of Taiwan.</p><h3>Taiwan\u2019s Response</h3><p>In response to these developments, Taiwan's plans have not significantly changed despite the urging of defense experts. Taiwan\u2019s military aims to provide \u201cresolute defense and multi-domain deterrence.\u201d Multi-domain deterrence means to contest what is called the \u201cgrey zone,\u201d where various actors engage in both military and non-military actions to accomplish strategic objectives while avoiding the onset of overt, conventional warfare. This means warding off PLAAF incursions into its airspace, contesting PLAN submarines shadowing ROC naval assets, and defending against cyber attacks from non-state Chinese actors.</p><p>Many military experts argue that instead of its plans to meet the PLA head-on, Taiwan needs to buy as much time as possible to allow the US to fight through the Chinese missile defense zone to <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2021/11/taiwans-defense-plans-are-going-off-the-rails/\"><u>bring assistance</u></a>. To them, this means adopting an asymmetric defense, making any invasion as painful as possible for the invader. Instead of large prestige projects, analysts suggested that Taiwan acquire vast quantities of coastal defense cruise missiles, mobile short-range air defenses, naval mines, and drones that can survive an initial attack from the PLARF and then engage in a protracted, dispersed and multi-faceted attrition campaign.</p><p>The current equipment priorities do not reflect these recommendations. Taiwan currently plans to purchase a variety of big-budget platforms. The US will provide some of these, but current equipment is old, and replacements are costly. F-16V (Block 70) fighters, one of the Ministry of National Defense (MND) priorities, are <a href=\"https://www.dsca.mil/press-media/major-arms-sales/taipei-economic-and-cultural-representative-office-united-states-11\"><u>expected to cost $8 billion</u></a>. Taiwan's defense budget, although increasing, is <a href=\"https://www.cfr.org/blog/taiwan-announced-record-defense-budget-it-enough-deter-china\"><u>around $19 billion</u></a>. The current fighter fleet already consumes 12.6% of the defense budget. Taiwanese defense planners are also seeking to purchase more weapons that would allow them to strike at the Chinese homeland. In 2020, the US agreed to sell 11 High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) to Taiwan, with a further 18 being added to the <a href=\"https://focustaiwan.tw/politics/202305100015\"><u>order in 2022</u></a>, bringing the total to 29. HIMARS does have some utility, as Ukrainian forces have proven by using it to target Russian logistics and command centers, but Taiwan will not have the spare capacity to conduct strikes on symbolic political targets, which the PLARF will.&nbsp;</p><p>$2 billion is being spent on M1A2 Abrams Main Battle tanks, which the MND expects to use to repel an invasion once PLA units land, despite the apparent implication that the PLA would not launch an invasion without air superiority. These units would be highly vulnerable and are of questionable use in a scenario where the enemy dominates the air. Ukraine has <a href=\"https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html\"><u>disabled</u></a> thousands of Russian tanks and infantry fighting vehicles using drones, showing armored vehicles vulnerability even in a situation where neither side has air superiority. Although Taiwan is <a href=\"https://missiledefenseadvocacy.org/intl_cooperation/taiwan/\"><u>upgrading</u></a> its Patriot air defense systems to challenge Chinese airpower, it only has two of the estimated ten battalions it would take to cover the island effectively. This deficiency could be resolved in the medium term by<a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2022/04/ukraine-shows-why-taiwan-needs-more-air-defense/\"><u> buying Patriot systems from NATO countries</u></a>, which are due to replace them with more advanced systems towards the end of the decade, but this is a few years away.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd0f62473-5f05-42a6-b8cc-687a3b0c1aee_630x360.jpeg\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/xQufwwhJsu4TJLwkW/un1cabwzpmbxru0uw43u\" alt=\"\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/xQufwwhJsu4TJLwkW/lbumzxa7mr9dadclh4cp 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/xQufwwhJsu4TJLwkW/jetbppzbgu6b1hlvquru 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/xQufwwhJsu4TJLwkW/xzrptcagcksj3v6qve6f 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/xQufwwhJsu4TJLwkW/un1cabwzpmbxru0uw43u 1456w\"></a></p><p>A Russian T-72 tank that was destroyed by a Ukrainian drone.</p><p>Like many other military procurement plans, these proposals are also subject to significant delays. The F-16V fighters were first ordered in 2019, but the first jets are currently subject to delays, reportedly due to software upgrade problems. Although HIMARS is presently being delivered ahead of schedule, it won\u2019t be in Taiwanese hands until 2026. Due to the war in Ukraine, delivery schedules for crucial weapons and munitions, such as Stinger missiles, have been pushed back, in many cases, for years.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the most egregious procurement decision is Taiwan\u2019s indigenously produced diesel-electric submarines, which <a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-taiwan-china-submarines-20190509-story.html\"><u>are expected to cost over $10 billion</u></a>. Although submarines have been used by weaker naval powers to contest control of the sea (the most famous being the U-boat threat posed by Germany in the two world wars), the Taiwan Straits and surrounding waters are relatively shallow. This makes Chinese attempts to find and destroy them easier than in a deeper ocean. Furthermore, only a third of naval assets are typically available to be at sea due to training and repair needs. Two or three submarines cannot stop the PLA from invading the island. With a limited budget, these acquisitions are questionable at best.</p><p>Problems exist not just at the strategic level. The MND has struggled to adapt basic training to reflect the changes in Taiwan's military situation. Soldiers must learn the <a href=\"https://www.nationaldefensemagazine.org/articles/2023/5/12/taiwans-intangible-potentially-disastrous-defense-problems\"><u>goose step</u></a> rather than spending more of the precious four months of basic training on more urgent military skills. From 2024, conscripts will be required to serve a year instead of four months, but it is unclear whether conscripts will be doing more helpful training. Although the 2023 National Defence Report aims to increase the number of live firing drills that recruits perform in basic training, this could be from a remarkably low level. Analyst Tanner Greer reports that some recruits <a href=\"https://scholars-stage.org/why-i-fear-for-taiwan/\"><u>firing fewer than 300 rounds</u></a> during their entire training. Although reservists returning for two-week refresher courses are due to increase the number of rounds they fire in training, this is to a barely <a href=\"https://news.usni.org/2023/09/13/2023-taiwan-national-defense-report\"><u>sufficient 138</u></a>. As a result, many otherwise patriotic Taiwanese are demoralized by the poor quality of training they receive, which tempers the MND's claims that millions of reservists are available in an emergency as many are simply not trained to be of any real utility. Problems exist in more than just non-commissioned ranks. Remarkably, despite Taiwan\u2019s military sending dozens of officers to West Point for advanced training, none have made it to the flag officer level, reflecting an insular culture hostile to those with valuable outsider experience.&nbsp;</p><p>To make matters worse, much of the equipment the Taiwanese army possesses is inoperable, and many units are drastically under-strength. Some front-line units have as little <a href=\"https://archive.ph/OcVAd#selection-1191.170-1191.571\"><u>as 60% of the manpower</u></a> they are supposed to have. In 2020, Foreign Policy reported a serving Taiwanese soldier saying that <a href=\"https://archive.ph/LU6JA#selection-1167.0-1171.26\"><u>only 30% of Taiwan\u2019s tanks</u></a> are in a state comparable to US minimum requirements. Given the MND expects the battle for Taiwan to be won by these front-line ground units, it is an understatement to say this is a little concerning.&nbsp;</p><p>Optimistic assessments of Taiwan\u2019s armed forces assert that its professional armed forces are well-placed to defeat the PLA, but a more honest assessment would be that there are significant challenges that provoke questions about the chosen strategy to defend Taiwan in the event of a war.</p><h3>Why won\u2019t they adopt asymmetric defense?&nbsp;</h3><p>To outsiders, the lack of urgency seems strange. However, institutional intransigence, political limitations, and likely good intelligence on Chinese invasion plans all play into why Taiwan doesn\u2019t change its course. The outcome of these choices is a tendency to prioritize highly visible weapons systems over those potentially more effective in an invasion scenario.</p><p>At first, the primary blocker to changing military plans would seem to be the military. This is largely accurate. Despite a former chief of the General Staff, Adm. Lee Hsi-Min, introducing a plan that reflected the changes China\u2019s military had made in 2017, the document was subsequently binned, and references to it within the military were <a href=\"https://warontherocks.com/2021/11/taiwans-defense-plans-are-going-off-the-rails/\"><u>reportedly discouraged</u></a>. The latest National Defence Report does use terms such as Asymmetric Approach, but current purchasing priorities show this is mainly cover and does not represent a change in approach.&nbsp;</p><p>Although the military should bear a significant amount of blame for refusing to evolve, it is commanded by politicians who have struggled to force it to chart another course. Complicating this task has been the efforts of the Tsai government to get to grips with another key pillar of the state, the intelligence agencies. Taiwan has the National Security Bureau, which is equivalent to the CIA or MI6, and the Military Intelligence Bureau (MIB), which sits under the MND and is assigned to gather human intelligence (HUMINT) regarding the PLA. Despite being responsible for gathering HUMINT, since the early 2000s, it has banned itself from sending agents to mainland China.&nbsp; The NSB is generally well regarded. The MIB, on the other hand, has had a <a href=\"https://globaltaiwan.org/2023/08/taiwans-military-intelligence-undergoing-reforms-amid-growing-threats-from-the-pla/\"><u>series of scandals</u></a> and was under <a href=\"https://www.intelligenceonline.com/government-intelligence/2023/06/16/yang-jing-se-the-taiwanese-general-trying-to-get-military-intelligence-back-on-its-feet,109994713-art\"><u>threat of closure</u></a>. In 2021, <a href=\"https://www.bannedbook.org/bnews/cnnews/hknews/20210221/1491278.html\"><u>4 former officials of the MIB</u></a>, one of whom was a general, were found to have been agents of the PRC and were recruiting agents for them in Taiwan. This betrayal, along with a myriad of other issues, has meant that the government has had to spend resources reforming it rather than utilizing its information to more accurately understand how the balance of power has changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>A further factor in the reluctance to change Taiwan's strategy is that it would require significant political costs. Foremost, the cost of a change to asymmetric defense would be asking more voters to defend themselves and accept the possibility of death or injury. It would be admitting that Taiwan was in a far weaker position than previously suggested, and the military cannot protect the island as it would have done in the past. Although support for defending Taiwan has risen in polling over the last few years, and other advanced democracies such as Poland have successfully raised volunteer defense forces, Taiwanese politicians do not appear to be willing to make this change. To a certain extent, this is because military advice would be against it. It would also change the relationship with the mainland unpredictably and may make the CCP think the island is gearing up for independence, accelerating a rush to confrontation.&nbsp; Secondly, Taiwan's costly platforms it purchases from the US are thought to signal to voters and China that Taiwan is a valued ally. NATO partners such as Turkey are prevented from buying top-of-the-range American military equipment, but when Taiwan makes big-ticket purchases, it is saying that it is a first-rank ally despite the dubious military value of some of them.&nbsp;</p><p>A further reason Taiwan maintains its current lack of urgency must include the role of intelligence in decision-making. Although the MIB has its problems, there is close cooperation with the United States, which operates a listening post on the island to help its intelligence-gathering efforts. Even if there weren\u2019t this cooperation, modern satellites, and communications technology would make a genuine build-up of an invasion force easy to spot. Coordinating an active invasion plan would require senior Chinese politicians and military leaders to meet more often, which it can be assumed would be noticed by relevant foreign intelligence agencies which have had an improved track record of uncovering critical information about&nbsp;</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Taken in turn, these are understandable reasons why Taiwan does not feel the same urgency to abandon its current plans and adopt a more realistic but challenging defense strategy. Even though the reasons are understandable, this does not mean they are justified. As Australia recently proved by canceling a submarine contract with France in order to develop nuclear submarines instead, even developed procurement plans can be changed if the relevant authorities recognize that situations have changed. Taiwan could cancel its orders of expensive fighter jets and tanks and instead buy far more coastal defense cruise missiles, mobile short-range air defenses, naval mines, and drones, as well as ensure adequate stocks of munitions to enable its professional and reserve forces to train properly. Taiwan has a number of significant advantages in any proposed conflict with China, but its current procurement priorities, lack of suitable training, and unwillingness to pay the political cost of changing direction risk undermining its geographical and home advantage. Ultimately, China has been building its forces to successfully assault the island of Taiwan, while Taiwan has not been able to sufficiently reassess how it will successfully counter these changes. If this continues to be the case as the 100th anniversary of the CCP approaches, Chinese leadership may think an invasion of Taiwan is a gamble worth taking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>You can follow the <a href=\"https://kitsonjonathon.substack.com/\">kitstack here</a>.&nbsp;<br><br>I'd be interested in what EA forum members think of the analysis above.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "JKitson"}}, {"_id": "JZgggYhemLKF7GQj9", "title": "Specification Gaming: How AI Can Turn Your Wishes Against You [RA Video]", "postedAt": "2023-12-01T19:30:58.786Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "Writer"}}, {"_id": "H7rjCEmhcWscZsEnE", "title": "What do we really know about growth in LMICs?

We need specific interventions to evaluate, and \"lobby for general economic liberalization\" won't cut it.</p>\n<p>The good news is that a large and active group of \"macro-development\" economists <em>have</em> been enhancing our understanding of growth in developing countries. They (mostly) don't run RCTs, but they still have credible research designs that can tell us important things about the causes and constraints of growth. In this series of posts, I want to lay out some stylized facts about growth in developing countries. These are claims which are backed up by the best research on this topic, and which tell us something useful about the causes and constraints of growth in developing countries.</p>\n<p>My hope is not to pitch any specific interventions, but rather to give you the lay of the land, on which you can build the case for specific interventions. <strong>The way I hope for you to read this series is with an entrepreneurial eye.</strong> \"This summary suggests that X is a key bottleneck to growth; I suspect Y could help solve X at scale. I should look more into Y as a potential intervention.\" or \"This summary says that X process helps with growth; let me brainstorm ways we could accelerate X.\"</p>\n<p>As part of that, an important caveat is that I will not cover topics where I believe there's no prospect for an effective intervention. For example, a large body of work emphasizes the importance of good institutions for development; I don't believe that topic will yield any promising interventions, so I won't cover it.</p>\n<h1>Sectoral Transformation</h1>\n<p>In this post, I will start with the fundamental path of growth: <em>sectoral transformation</em>. Every country that has ever gotten rich has had the following transformation: first, most of the population works in agriculture. Then, people start to move from agriculture to manufacturing, coinciding with a large increase in the country's growth rate. Finally, people move out of manufacturing and into services, coinciding with the country's growth slowing down as it matures into a rich economy. This is the process of sectoral transformation, and it is basically a universal truth of development. So it's no surprise that a big focus of macro-development is how to catalyze sectoral transformation in developing countries. That research has yielded four takeaways:</p>\n<h2>1. Agricultural productivity growth can drive sectoral transformation... or hurt it.</h2>\n<p>Every economy starts out as agrarian, because everyone needs food to survive. Agricultural productivity growth allows economies to produce enough food with fewer people, so that most people can move out of agriculture. This is why the US can produce more food per person than India, even though 2% of the US workforce in agriculture compared to 45% of India's workforce. So it seems natural that productivity growth in agriculture is the necessary push for sectoral transformation. However, agricultural productivity growth also increases the income people can earn in agriculture relative to in other sectors, so it could also incentivize people to <em>stay</em> in agriculture. That is the opposite of what we want! Which of these two stories is true?</p>\n<p>The evidence on this question is <em>very</em> mixed, with studies finding support for opposite conclusions, sometimes even in the same setting. For example, <a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CJ1PFXfldlmP2OdGzsPcukUAs8kw1fhU/view\">Gollin, Hansen and Wingender (2021)</a> find that the Green Revolution reduced land use for agriculture and dramatically increased incomes, while <a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/moscona/files/moscona_gr_final.pdf\">Moscona (2019)</a> finds no income gains from the Green Revolution and in fact a decrease in urbanization.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-wHwwCibCWTPeoDhGY-2\" id=\"fnref-wHwwCibCWTPeoDhGY-2\">[2]</a></sup> In general, however, agricultural productivity growth will probably promote sectoral transformation under two conditions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Productivity growth reduces labor demand.</strong> When an agricultural technology reduces the labor required to plant an acre - because it replaces that labor with machines, or because new seeds require less maintenance, or because farms become larger and there are economies of scale - it will generally reduce the demand for labor. That in turn pushes people out of agriculture. (<a href=\"http://www.cemfi.es/~bustos/Agricultural_Productivity_Structural_Transformation.pdf\">Bustos, Caprettini and Ponticelli 2016</a>) Mechanized planting and harvesting technologies, weed-resistant plants that don't require a lot of labor to weed plants in the fields, irrigation systems that reduce the time farmers need to spend on water management - all of these will help release workers from agriculture and into the sectors that can make a country rich.</li>\n<li><strong>The country is relatively closed to trade.</strong> When farmers sell only within their country, there's only so much demand for food; agricultural productivity growth allows that demand to be satisfied with less labor, and thus promotes sectoral transformation. In contrast, when farmers can sell to the world, the demand for food is large enough that no country can fully satisfy it, so agricultural productivity growth makes the country specialize in agriculture. Indeed, the Green Revolution reduced sectoral transformation more in countries that were more open to trade. (<a href=\"https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/moscona/files/moscona_gr_final.pdf\">Moscona 2019</a>) This story can also explain why generations of development scholars who studied industrialization in the US and Europe were convinced of the need for agricultural productivity growth. Historically, the world was much less globalized, so agricultural exporting was less of a phenomenon and thus agricultural productivity growth did actually cause sectoral transformation. Unfortunately, that may not be true anymore.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>These are both sufficient conditions; agricultural productivity growth will boost sectoral transformation if either of these conditions are met. In general, 1) is a more robust condition, but 2) could still hold especially in sub-Saharan African countries where trade is quite costly.</p>\n<p>It's worth contrasting the agricultural productivity growth story with a mirror-image story; maybe instead of agricultural productivity growth <em>pushing</em> workers into the industrial sector, we could have industrial productivity growth <em>pulling</em> workers into that sector by increasing industrial wages. The research isn't very satisfactory on whether the \"pull\" story constitutes a viable path of development today.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-wHwwCibCWTPeoDhGY-3\" id=\"fnref-wHwwCibCWTPeoDhGY-3\">[3]</a></sup>  Industrial productivity growth is obviously worthwhile, and I'll cover it more in this series, but whether it specifically pulls workers out of agriculture in practice is a question without great answers.</p>\n<p>But why is agricultural productivity in poor countries so low to begin with? What are the most promising sources of agricultural productivity growth? The main culprit is <strong>mechanization/input intensification.</strong> Rich country farms use 300-800x more intermediates and machines than poor country farms, and this gap accounts for 2/3 of the productivity gap between poor-country agriculture and rich-country agriculture. (<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/j92gy8j6fwc1nbs/The_Macroeconomics_of_Intensive_Agriculture_paper_and_appendix.pdf?dl=0\">Boppart et al, 2023</a>) So why does this gap exist?</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Agricultural machines and intermediate inputs have systematically higher prices in poor countries than in rich countries. (<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/j92gy8j6fwc1nbs/The_Macroeconomics_of_Intensive_Agriculture_paper_and_appendix.pdf?dl=0\">Boppart et al, 2023</a>) This can be interpreted as a consequence of low manufacturing productivity, since that makes it expensive to produce agricultural inputs and thus discourages their usage. Reducing the prices of these productive inputs and machines would be the single biggest contributor to increasing mechanization/input intensification in poor country agriculture, and thus a critical part of sectoral transformation.</li>\n<li>Farms in developing countries are extremely small, and some intermediates or machines could have scale economies that make them unprofitable at a small scale. There is also evidence that farm sizes in developing countries are systematically distorted by government policies (<a href=\"https://sci-hub.ru/10.1257/aer.104.6.1667\">Adamopoulos and Restuccia 2014</a>), but that ventures into politically-sensitive territory where I don't see prospects for effective interventions.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>2. Education leads people to move out of agriculture (but with some negative spillovers).</h2>\n<p>A lot of \"working in agriculture\" starts in someone's first job; they start working in the fields and they just never leave. I have used the term \"moving out of agriculture\" loosely, as if the process is driven by individuals working in agriculture, one day deciding to switch to a job outside of agriculture, and then switching. But <em>half</em> of all sectoral transformation is driven by new cohorts entering the workforce. (<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/bt6syililg6dr5u/HumanSide.pdf?dl=0\">Porzio et al, 2022</a>) In other words, sectoral transformation happens when one year, 70% of school-leavers work in agriculture, but 10 years later, only 30% of school-leavers work in agriculture. The fact that half of this enormous trend is driven by new cohorts points to a critical role for education in driving sectoral transformation. Indeed, it's strongly established that education pushes people out of agriculture. In Indonesia, school construction reduced people's propensity to work in agriculture (<a href=\"https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3386223\">Karachiwalla and Palloni 2019</a>); in China, the expansion of higher education across regions did the same (<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CbzPMFM3x6YixxXt8KI0FTd7-soGq6lv/view\">Coelli 2023</a>); globally, education expansions tend to reduce agricultural employment, to the extent that 20% of all sectoral transformation globally can be attributed to education. (<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/bt6syililg6dr5u/HumanSide.pdf?dl=0\">Porzio et al, 2022</a>)</p>\n<p>One caveat that matters for these results is that these studies also find negative spillovers: when people get educated and leave agriculture, it makes the uneducated people in that area and neighboring areas <em>even more</em> likely to stay in agriculture, probably through reducing the supply of agricultural workers and thus raising their wages. This mutes the overall effect of education on sectoral transformation. Nonetheless, the 20% attribution is net of these spillovers, and so education is firmly established as a key driver of sectoral transformation.</p>\n<h2>3. Barriers to reallocation are surprisingly small; people select into sectors based on their skills.</h2>\n<p>A long-standing puzzle is why sectoral transformation doesn't happen <em>faster</em>. In developing countries, agricultural productivity (and thus wages) are significantly lower than non-agricultural productivity (and thus wages) (<a href=\"https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1093/qje/qjt056\">Gollin, Lagakos and Waugh 2014</a>), so shouldn't people find it profitable to just switch sectors and increase their income? To rationalize why people don't move out of agriculture faster, researchers historically imagined large barriers to reallocation---e.g. migration costs, or difficulty of finding jobs in the non-agricultural sector, or family constraints. Many development interventions today are based on the idea of tearing down these barriers to people leaving agriculture.</p>\n<p>These interventions have a shaky foundation, because it turns out that there is not much of a puzzle: the answer is probably due to selection. People who work in agriculture are significantly less skilled and educated than people who work outside agriculture, which explains why they earn less even with no barriers to reallocation. (<a href=\"https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/mac.20160236\">Herrendorf and Schoellman 2018</a>) When people actually leave agriculture, and we observe their wages before and after they switch sectors, their wage gains from switching are 8-40% of the average wage differences. (<a href=\"https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.1093/jeea/jvaa043\">Hamory et al, 2020</a>) There's still some doubt you can cast over this interpretation, but I consider it settled.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-wHwwCibCWTPeoDhGY-4\" id=\"fnref-wHwwCibCWTPeoDhGY-4\">[4]</a></sup></p>\n<p>This is a negative result, in that it cuts against most interventions you could imagine that simply push people across sectors without any underlying changes to their skills. Such interventions are unlikely to benefit the movers, but they're also unlikely to promote growth if those movers are not very productive in the manufacturing sector (which is suggested by the fact that they don't see wage gains). Instead, this result points us towards interventions that actually improve the human capital of agricultural workers, like education or job training.</p>\n<h2>4. Most sectoral transformation today comes from people moving into services, not manufacturing.</h2>\n<p>The transition I described before - where people leave agriculture for the high-growth manufacturing sector, which helps countries grow really fast, until eventually they mature into rich countries and work in services instead - used to describe the path of development. For better or worse, that is not what happens today. Instead, a large number of movement out of agriculture is movement into <em>services</em>. Countries today are seeing a lower peak of manufacturing employment relative to the past, and a large movement of workers from the high-growth manufacturing sector to the low-growth services sector. (<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10887-015-9122-3\">Rodrik 2016</a>; <a href=\"https://drodrik.scholar.harvard.edu/files/dani-rodrik/files/globalization_structural_change_productivity_growth_with_africa_update.pdf?m=1435002696\">McMillan and Rodrik 2014</a>) This is the famous \"premature deindustrialization\" thesis, which warns us that developing countries today are not industrializing in the way that rich countries of today did in the past. There are many proposed explanations - competition from China, automation, reduced global demand for manufacturing goods, etc - but what matters are the consequences of this trend.</p>\n<p>This distinction between manufacturing-led growth and service-led growth matters. Manufacturing has historically had a number of advantages over services as a path of development. First and most importantly, it's tradable, so a country can serve the whole global economy and make a lot more prosperity, relative to making services that can only be consumed domestically. Second, manufacturing is intensive in unskilled labor, so it can uplift a huge number of uneducated workers, relative to services which employs mainly educated workers. Third, manufacturing has high returns to scale, enabling large-scale production, whereas services generally are more limited in this dimension. Thus, services have historically not been a good path of development.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn-wHwwCibCWTPeoDhGY-5\" id=\"fnref-wHwwCibCWTPeoDhGY-5\">[5]</a></sup></p>\n<p>Nevertheless, global trends are hard to fight. They happen often for reasons outside any country's control. Any serious interventions that move people out of agriculture are likely to move them into services, whether we want that or not. So it's better to know that and design interventions with that in mind.</p>\n<p>Can transformation directly into services be beneficial? In India, growth in services definitely did improve living standards, but the benefits accrued mainly to high-income urban residents. (<a href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/yv4x3kjmv3vr67d/unequalgrowth_paper.pdf?dl=0\">Fan, Peters and Zilibotti 2021</a>) In other countries, the evidence for service-led growth is grimmer; in China, when the expansion of universities spurred movement from agriculture to services, this reallocation actually <em>slowed</em> income growth relative to if there had been no reallocation. (<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CbzPMFM3x6YixxXt8KI0FTd7-soGq6lv/view?usp=drive_link\">Coelli 2023</a>) These findings suggest that maybe developing countries should actively resist this trend and aim to grow world-class manufacturing sectors anyway. This is the shadow of <em>industrial policy</em> that looms over every discussion of growth, which I will cover in a following post.</p>\n<p>The optimistic perspective is that the characteristics that made manufacturing special - tradability, scale, and employing unskilled workers - are not so special today as they used to be. Trade in services is growing, making it conceivable that countries could export services at scale (e.g. India's IT sector) and gain all the benefits of exporting; technology could make services easier to deliver with lower skill. So it would be exceptionally valuable to have a) technology/policy that increases trade in services, b) technology that increase the scale of production of services, and c) technology that reduces the skill barrier for services work. Whether these are feasible goals will be one of the defining questions of growth in the 21st century.</p>\n<hr class=\"footnotes-sep\">\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn-wHwwCibCWTPeoDhGY-1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>But also see Tom Davidson's excellent <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/report-on-social-returns-to-productivity-growth/\">report</a> on the social returns to productivity growth, which finds that \"promoting growth\" is approximately half as effective as cash transfers. I think the growth intervention considered in that report (funding R&amp;D that generally increases global growth) isn't even close to the most effective we can imagine for increasing growth in developing countries. But I want to flag this report as a good example of how to do cost-effectiveness analysis with macroeconomic outcomes like growth, and almost any cost-effectiveness analysis of a growth intervention will have to use a general equilibrium model in the way that this report does. <a href=\"#fnref-wHwwCibCWTPeoDhGY-1\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-wHwwCibCWTPeoDhGY-2\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>These studies find different conclusions when studying the same event (the Green Revolution) because they use different designs to establish causality. Both of them have serious issues. Gollin, Hansen and Wingender use the timing of high-yielding varieties being released as a natural experiment. However, the timing of HYVs being released lines up unfortunately with the start of East Asia's growth kickoff, making it likely that their results are just capturing the East Asian growth miracle. Moscona uses the maximum agronomically-predicted potential yields for different crops in the arable land of a country to identify which countries were most affected by the Green Revolution, and uses this agronomic potential as a natural experiment. However, the instrument is not very strong, making the conclusions noisy and unreliable. <a href=\"#fnref-wHwwCibCWTPeoDhGY-2\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-wHwwCibCWTPeoDhGY-3\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p><a href=\"https://sci-hub.ru/10.1257/mac.3.3.127\">Alvarez-Cuadrado and Poschke (2011)</a> argue that in modern economies, the \"push\" story is more important, but there are issues with this interpretation. They measure the relative importance of \"push\" (agricultural productivity) vs \"pull\" (industrial productivity) using the path of relative prices in agriculture and manufacturing. (If manufacturing prices fall faster than agricultural prices, that suggests manufacturing productivity is rising faster than agricultural productivity, and thus the pull factor is more important. Vice versa as well.) They show that in currently industrialized economies, before 1920, the price of manufacturing goods fell faster than the price of agricultural goods, but the opposite happened after 1960. This can be interpreted as industrial productivity growth being more important before 1920, but agricultural productivity growth being more important after 1960. The only issue is that the late industrializers in their sample - Finland, Korea and Japan - don't actually follow this pattern, with mostly flat relative prices, pointing to an equal role for push and pull factors. <a href=\"#fnref-wHwwCibCWTPeoDhGY-3\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-wHwwCibCWTPeoDhGY-4\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p><a href=\"https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/jep.34.3.174\">Lagakos (2020)</a> argues that evidence based on \"switchers\" is misleading because switchers are unrepresentative; e.g. they might be in peri-urban areas with both agricultural and non-agricultural work that they can freely take up on different days, which doesn't really tell us anything about the effect of e.g. permanent rural to urban migration. This disagreement ultimately comes down to whether you believe the switchers have the <em>highest benefit</em> from switching (in which case their meager gains are an upper bound on how much the gains from switching could be) or if they have the <em>lowest cost</em> from switching (in which case their benefits could actually be much lower than average). It's not a settled question but I find the former view much more empirically plausible given e.g. that schooling is one of the biggest causes of switching, and schooling should increase the benefits without really changing the costs of switching. <a href=\"#fnref-wHwwCibCWTPeoDhGY-4\" class=\"footnote-backref\">\u21a9\ufe0e</a></p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"fn-wHwwCibCWTPeoDhGY-5\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>It's important to acknowledge that a lot of the obsession with manufacturing over services is inherited from the rich-country perspective, where people have long cherished manufacturing as <em>the</em> source of prosperity. As rich countries have transitioned into the service economy and their growth has slowed down, this has led people to view the service sector as a pox on the economy that slows down growth. This is the \"Baumol cost disease\" argument. But despite the name, Baumol's cost disease <em>is not an inefficiency.</em> If getting rich makes people demand more services, then it's optimal to have more people producing those services, even if that slows down GDP growth. Besides, \"slow growth in services\" may not even really be accurate. <a href=\"https://personal.lse.ac.uk/YoungA/StructuralTransformation.pdf\">(Young 2014)</a> Nevertheless, when it comes to developing countries of today, these arguments don't really apply, and it still seems better for countries to industrialize rather than going directly into services.

The moral truism underlying Effective Altruism is that we have strong reasons to do more good, and it\u2019s <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/beneficentrism\">worth adopting the efficient promotion of the impartial good among one\u2019s life projects</a>. (One can do this in a \u201cnon-totalizing\u201d way, i.e. without it being one\u2019s <i>only</i> project.) Anyone who personally adopts that project (to any non-trivial extent) counts, in my book, as an effective altruist (whatever their opinion of the EA movement and its institutions).</p><p>Many people don\u2019t adopt this explicit goal as a personal priority to <i>any</i> degree, but still do significant good via more particular commitments (to more specific communities, causes, or individuals). That\u2019s fine by me, but I do think that even people who aren\u2019t themselves effective altruists should <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/why-not-effective-altruism\">recognize the EA project as a good one</a>. We should all generally want people to be <i>more</i> motivated by efficient impartial beneficence (on the margins), even if you don\u2019t think it\u2019s the <i>only</i> thing that matters.</p><p>A popular (but silly) criticism of effective altruism is that it is entirely vacuous. As <a href=\"https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/the-effective-altruism-shell-game\">Freddie deBoer</a> writes:</p><blockquote><p>[T]his sounds like so obvious and general a project that it can hardly denote a specific philosophy or project at all\u2026 [T]his is an utterly banal set of goals that are shared by literally everyone who sincerely tries to act charitably.</p></blockquote><p>This is <strong>clearly false</strong>. As <a href=\"https://benthams.substack.com/p/freddie-deboer-is-wrong-about-effective\">Bentham\u2019s Bulldog replies</a>, most people give <i>lip service</i> to doing good effectively. But then they go and donate to local children\u2019s hospitals and puppy shelters, while showing no interest in learning about neglected tropical diseases or improving factory-farmed animal welfare. DeBoer himself <i>dismisses without argument</i> \u201cweird\u201d concerns about shrimp welfare and existential risk reduction, which one very clearly cannot just <i>dismiss as a priori irrelevant</i> if one actually cares about promoting the impartial good. The latter entails a very unusual degree of open-mindedness.</p><p>The fact is: open-minded, cause-agnostic concern for promoting the impartial good is <i>vanishingly rare</i>. As a result, the few people who sincerely have and act upon this concern end up striking everyone else as <i>extremely weird</i>. We all know that the way you\u2019re <i>supposed</i> to behave is to be a good ally to your social group, do normal socially-approved things that signal conformity and loyalty (and perhaps a non-threatening degree of generosity towards socially-approved recipients). \u201cLiterally everyone\u201d does <i>this</i> much, I guess. But what sort of weirdo starts looking into <i>numbers</i>, and argues on that basis that chickens are a higher priority than puppies? <i>Horrible utilitarian nerds, that\u2019s who! </i>Or so the normie social defense mechanism seems to be (never mind that <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/beneficence-is-not-exclusively-utilitarian\">efficient impartial beneficence is not exclusively utilitarian</a>, and ought rather to be a significant component of <i>any</i> reasonable moral view).</p><h3>Let\u2019s be honest</h3><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Everyone is motivated to rationalize what they\u2019re antecedently inclined to do. I know I do plenty of suboptimal things, due to both (i) failing to care as much as would be objectively warranted about many things (from non-cute animals to distant people), and (ii) being akratic and failing to be sufficiently moved even by things I value, like my own health and well-being. But I try to be honest about it, and recognize that (like everyone) I\u2019m just irrational in a lot of ways, and <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/caplans-conscience-objection-to-utilitarianism\">that\u2019s OK, even if it isn\u2019t ideal</a>.</p><p>Vegans care more about animals than I do, and that\u2019s clearly to their credit. I try to compensate through some high-impact donations, and <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/confessions-of-a-cheeseburger-ethicist\">I think that\u2019s also good</a> (and better than going vegan without the donations). I encourage others to do likewise.</p><p>We all have various \u201crooted\u201d concerns, linked to particular communities, individuals, or causes to which we have a social or emotional connection. That\u2019s all good. Those motivations are an appropriate response to real goods in the world. But we all know there are lots of other goods in the world that we don\u2019t so easily or naturally perceive, and that could plausibly outweigh the goods that are more personally salient to us. The really distinctive thing about effective altruism is that it seriously attempts to take <i>all</i> those neglected interests into account. As I wrote in <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/level-up-impartiality\">level-up impartiality</a>:</p><blockquote><p>[Imagine] taking all the warmth and wonder and richness that you\u2019re aware of in your personal life, and imaginatively projecting it into the shadows of strangers.</p><p>We glimpse but a glimmer of the world\u2019s true value. It\u2019s enough to turn our heads, and rightly so. If we could but see all that\u2019s glimpsed by various others, in all its richness, depth, and importance, we would better understand what\u2019s truly warranted. But even from our limited personal perspectives, we may at least come to understand <i>that there is</i> such value in everyone, even if we cannot always grasp it directly. And if we strive to let that knowledge guide our most important choices, our actions will be more in line with the reasons that exist\u2014reasons we know we would endorse, if only we could see them as clearly as we do the ones in our more personal vicinity.</p><p>And yes, from the outside this may look like being moved by drab shadows rather than the vibrant values we grasp closer to home. But of course it isn\u2019t really the shadows that move us, but the promise of the person beneath: a person every bit as complex, vulnerable, and vibrant as those you know and love.</p></blockquote><p>Such impartiality involves a very distinctive\u2014you might even say <i>weird</i>\u2014moral perspective. I think it should be generally recognized as a good and admirable one, but I don\u2019t see how anyone could honestly think that it\u2019s commonplace. Few people who give to charity make any serious effort to do <i>the most good they can</i> with the donation. Few people who engage in political activism are seriously trying to do they most good they can with their activism. Few people pursuing an \u201cethical career\u201d are trying to do the most good they can with their career. And that\u2019s all fine\u2014plenty of good can still be done from more partial and less optimizing motives (and even EAs only pursue the EA project in <i>part </i>of their life). But the claim that the moral perspective underlying EA is \u201ctrivial\u201d or already \u201cshared by literally everyone\u201d is clearly false.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6iosy9o242d\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6iosy9o242d\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>I wonder if part of the resistance to EA may stem from people not wanting to admit that they actually aren\u2019t much motivated by a cause-agnostic concern for the general good. Maybe it sounds like an embarrassing thing to admit, because surely the general good is a worthy thing to aim at!</p><p>Maybe it would help to make the implications more explicit. To have a cause-agnostic concern for the impartial good, you have to be <i>open</i> <i>to the possibility</i> that shrimp welfare might matter more than saving a human life. Most people probably don\u2019t want to be open to that possibility. Maybe what they really want is more speciesist, like <i>helping humans effectively</i>. Further, maybe they don\u2019t want to be open to the possibility that <a href=\"https://www.philosophyetc.net/2016/01/expected-value-without-expecting-value.html\">a 10% chance of saving a million lives is better than saving 1000 for certain</a> (or that <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/all-probabilities-matter\">even the tiniest probabilities</a>, if sufficiently well-grounded, could take priority over sure things). So maybe they really just want to do something like <i>make a near-certain positive difference to human well-being</i>. That\u2019s a fine goal too, and maybe a sufficient basis to make use of some effective altruist resources like <a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/\">GiveWell</a>. But again, it\u2019s very different from caring about impartial value <i>as such</i>.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref3zr98i0epg7\"><sup><a href=\"#fn3zr98i0epg7\">[2]</a></sup></span></p><p>I don\u2019t think anyone needs to be <i>embarrassed</i> about having narrower concerns along these lines. Lots of them are really good! But I do think a broader concern is <i>better</i>\u2014just like saving distant kids from dying of malaria is better than providing local kids with more cultural opportunities (even though the latter is also good!). So I always like to <strong>encourage folks to question whether their current moral efforts are well-focused, and consider shifting their attention if they realize that they could do more good elsewhere.</strong> I think it\u2019s especially worth noting that our <i>collective</i> moral attention often gets caught on relatively less-important (but highly divisive) issues, so it\u2019s worth trying not to get sucked into that.</p><p>These recommendations flows from taking seriously the <i>ideas</i> of effective altruism, regardless of what you think of the actually-existing EA movement and institutions. If you aren\u2019t regularly prompted to think about whether your moral efforts are optimally allocated, then you should probably admit that the effective altruist project is actually pretty distinctive.</p><h3>OK, but what about the actual movement/institutions?</h3><p>I\u2019m also a fan of those: I know the <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/en-US/pledge#the-giving-what-we-can-pledge\">GWWC 10% pledge</a> has helped motivate me to do far more good than I otherwise would have.</p><p>See Scott Alexander\u2019s two-part defense of the EA movement as (i) <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/in-continued-defense-of-effective\">having done a lot of actual good</a>, and (ii) <a href=\"https://www.astralcodexten.com/p/contra-deboer-on-movement-shell-games\">providing the social scaffolding</a> to encourage people to actually put their beneficent motivations into practice.</p><p>For the best critical piece that I\u2019m aware of, see Benjamin Ross Hoffman\u2019s <a href=\"http://benjaminrosshoffman.com/effective-altruism-is-self-recommending\">Effective Altruism is Self-Recommending</a>. It\u2019s a totally fair worry that it\u2019s hard to assess whether the more speculative branches of EA are actually effective at achieving their goals or not. I\u2019m generally pretty trusting of these folks, but have no beef with those who judge things differently.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefl20ycmwdhw\"><sup><a href=\"#fnl20ycmwdhw\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;I\u2019d welcome a more diverse ecosystem of people seriously trying to optimize promotion of the impartial good via a range of different (but reasonable and rights-respecting) approaches.</p><h3>Serious Evaluation Goes Beyond Vibes</h3><p>Still, one thing I really want to stress is that any kind of serious concern for the impartial good is going to look <i>very different</i> from most people\u2019s default moral behaviour.</p><p>It should make you think that <a href=\"https://www.philosophyetc.net/2011/11/virtue-and-anonymous-donation.html\">donating openly is better than doing so quietly and anonymously</a>. It should make you think that <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/i/139056845/on-earning-to-give\">earning to give</a> could very well be an excellent idea (and discouraging it is morally very risky). It should make you open to all sorts of possibilities for doing good via unconventional means\u2014maybe even <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/i/92508593/this-all-sounds-very-reasonable-so-why-is-ea-so-controversial\">buying castles</a>!\u2014so long as it can be supported via a reasonable \u201cpathway to impact\u201d.</p><p>Most people don\u2019t do this. They just assess things based on vibes. \u201cEarning to give \u2192 bankers \u2192 bad.\u201d If pressed, they can offer a post hoc rationalization to support their verdict. But their verdict wasn\u2019t really based on the reasoning, since the latter is clearly contestable whereas their confidence in their verdict is absolute. Or they\u2019ll complain that pandemic prevention funding is going to European scientists (in contrast to global health funding going directly to Africa), as though it were the scientists rather than <i>the pandemic-vulnerable global population </i>that were the intended <i>beneficiaries</i> of the funding. Just a total failure to even <i>consider</i> indirect benefits.</p><p>I find this very frustrating. It would be <i>great</i> to have more people seriously engage with the project of effective altruism, and critically assessing where current EAs might be going wrong. But most of the actually-existing critics don\u2019t seem to be thinking seriously about these issues at all.</p><p>As a rule of thumb, I\u2019d encourage the vibes-based critics to consider the possibility that <i>people who have spent a significant chunk of their professional lives thinking carefully about how to do the most good might have some insights that a total neophyte who hasn\u2019t even thought about the matter for five minutes might be missing</i>. So many Twitter critics confidently repeat some utterly conventional thought as though <i>the mere fact of going against the conventional wisdom is evidence that EAs are nuts</i>. But society\u2019s conventional wisdom is often wrong (or at least not aligned with truly beneficent goals), so <strong>you need to actually look more closely into the issue to work out whether a criticism is warranted</strong> or not.</p><p>By all means, you <strong>absolutely should share your thoughts</strong> if you think you\u2019ve hit upon an important insight that might have been missed by <i>people who have spent a significant chunk of their professional lives thinking carefully about how to do the most good</i>. Even professionals make mistakes! But it\u2019s worth bearing in mind that neophytes are <i>even</i> <i>more likely</i> to make mistakes, and temper your confidence accordingly. Most of the people \u201cdunking\u201d on EA as \u201cobviously\u201d failing to do good effectively are being ridiculously overconfident in their parroting of conventional wisdom. By and large, <strong>conventional wisdom around altruism doesn\u2019t reliably indicate how to do good effectively, but just how to </strong><i><strong>signal generosity in a socially-approved way</strong></i>, and these are very different things. We should fully expect them to come apart, and for <i>truly effective</i> altruism to seem \u201cweird\u201d and \u201cunappealing\u201d to many.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn6iosy9o242d\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref6iosy9o242d\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>Indeed, it\u2019s so <i>extremely</i> false that many people apparently don\u2019t even <i>realize</i> that it is false at all, because they seemingly <strong>cannot even imagine what it would be like to care about the impartial good </strong><i><strong>per se</strong></i>, and instead assimilate this to ordinary concern for <i>any particular goods whatsoever</i>.

The goal is to provide a clear path to move your organization from \"we never did anything regarding marketing\" to \"now we have a marketing strategy running, and we just have to keep optimizing it.\"&nbsp;</p><p>It's important to note that the most classical concept of marketing strategy includes four key factors: product, price, place, and promotion. It's quite impossible to have a marketing plan for product and price without going deep into the intrinsic characteristics and goals of each organization, so I chose not to include them in this guide for simplicity's sake.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, you'll note that most of the examples and references in this plan assume most of your user's journey will be online, but keep in mind these can also be translated to an offline strategy.&nbsp;</p><p>Since this marketing plan was designed to help the broadest range possible of EA organizations, you probably won't find anything very specific for your organization's context. However, I hope that the information and resources will be enough not only to help you put your marketing efforts on the right track but also achieve better results - whatever that means for your organization.&nbsp;</p><p>You might want to increase your reach to have a bigger impact, or maybe you're looking for new donors or seeking new talent. Regardless of what you want to use marketing for, this roadmap provides a comprehensive checklist to make it work within the first two months of consistent effort.&nbsp;</p><h2>How to use this checklist</h2><p>This post is over 4,500 words, but don't worry about going through everything at once. The plan was specifically designed so that you can tackle each week individually.</p><p>Try to focus on completing the tasks each week. Although the time you spend on each task will depend on your expertise and the time available, I recommend dedicating at least four hours per week to the plan.</p><p>Book a weekly time on your calendar to work through the tasks, and be consistent with it. If you have a team, invite them to go through everything together, or at least book a weekly meeting to discuss the updates with them - the better your team understands the value of marketing, the higher the chances of it working in the long run.&nbsp;</p><p>There will be a lot of things to manage, so I created a project template on Google Sheets:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UbYgWuP0MKkDK1_KdQ9rtvBP2fPcOT4OsEDsLjyewUw/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>you can access it by clicking here</u></a> (please note that it's a complement to this article, not a replacement).&nbsp;</p><p>You will also notice that I won't go into too much detail about how to do a few of the tasks. This is because there are a lot of good tutorials for some of the things you'll have to do, and I find it more productive to link to them instead of producing something from scratch.&nbsp;</p><p>Also, the reality is that platforms change all the time, and it wouldn't make sense to throw you a detailed checklist for something that will probably look different next month.&nbsp;</p><p>However, if you're not able to execute something listed here,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/igorscaldini/\"><u>let me know on Linkedin</u></a>, and I'll explain it to you (and update this post).&nbsp;</p><h2>Week 1 - Building your marketing plan</h2><p>There are hundreds of frameworks out there designed to facilitate the process of creating a marketing plan, but in my experience most of them overcomplicate things and introduce unnecessary theory right at the start line, making it harder for non-marketers to come up with something practical and straightforward.&nbsp;</p><p>So, in a nutshell, below are the questions your marketing plan should answer. Note that I'm using the term \"customer\" for lack of a better term. A \u201ccustomer\u201d in the context of an EA organization may not be someone who is paying for anything, but the person that the organization is actually seeking to benefit (e.g. an undergraduate student studying machine learning).</p><ul><li>Who do you want to reach?</li><li>What's your message to this audience?</li><li>How are you going to reach those people?</li><li>How are you going to convert website visitors into potential customers?</li><li>How are you going to engage with those potential customers?</li><li>How are you going to convert these potential customers into real customers?</li><li>How are you going to deliver a great onboarding experience?</li><li>How are you going to retain your customers?</li><li>How are you going to encourage those customers to refer your organization to other people?</li></ul><p>Here is what it should look like:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EJRL8pKRTYdH2KZ9R/k79j7kdwsdyj6npiw2ql\"></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1r0pWI09K4nchxQ-1m6sKAI1c44_xehroKPEVs1pjHLA/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>Click here to open this template on Google Spreadsheet</u></a>.</p><p>Your goal in the first week should be to have those things figured out. If you have a team or a business partner, make sure to schedule time to answer these questions with them for two reasons:</p><ol><li>Marketing is a process, not a project, and it takes consistency to see results. The more the people on your team feel empowered to take care of your marketing strategy, the higher the chances of success.&nbsp;</li><li>Every time I do this exercise with a client, I'm surprised by the valuable insights that come from people who are not necessarily involved in the leadership.&nbsp;</li></ol><p><strong>Don't worry about coming up with the perfect plan</strong>. There is no need to stress about finding the perfect message or choosing the perfect target audience right at the start.&nbsp;</p><p>Your marketing plan will probably change when you start executing it and analyzing the data; this is actually a good thing because it means you're correcting your trajectory.&nbsp;</p><p>The point here is to get an overview of your marketing strategy so you have a starting point, but know that it's a live document that can be changed throughout the execution.</p><p>If, during the brainstorm, you feel you actually don't really know your audience, you can use another great framework called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mystorybrand.com/\"><u>StoryBrand</u></a>. It's free and very fun to go through, and will help you to understand your audience on a deeper level.&nbsp;</p><h2>Week 2 - Creating your website</h2><p>Although nowadays much of what happens on the internet takes place on social media, apps, forums, games and marketplaces, having a website for your organization is still very important for a few reasons:</p><ol><li>The internet is vast, and you want to make sure your audience has a place where they can trust the information regarding your organization, especially when they search for its name on search engines.&nbsp;</li><li>Having a website opens up a new world of opportunities in terms of audience acquisition through SEO (Search Engine Optimization) and Content Marketing - we'll get back to them later.&nbsp;</li><li>Through a website, you can process payments, display information and updates, and a bunch of other useful things that you can't (or shouldn\u2019t) do through third-party platforms.</li></ol><p>I'm not saying that posting on social media and other platforms besides your website is not a good idea - it is. I'm saying that it shouldn't be your plan A, especially at the beginning of your marketing strategy.</p><h3>How do you build a website?</h3><p>There are three alternatives you can consider when building your first website. I\u2019ll briefly talk about them below, but keep in mind that If you don't have experience building websites, hiring someone to do this for you can be a fast and cheap alternative.</p><p><strong>1. Use a popular and user-friendly CMS (Content Management System),</strong> such as Wix, Squarespace, or Shopify (for e-commerce). The process here is pretty straightforward: you choose a platform, pick a template, and customize it to your needs.</p><p><strong>2. Use WordPress or Webflow.&nbsp;</strong>These are probably the two most flexible website builder platforms you will find, and they have the advantage of being scalable and full of pre-built widgets (plugins) for pretty much all the features you can imagine. Although you don't need coding experience to build websites with these, it's a little bit technical. Here is a good tutorial on how to build your website using WordPress.</p><p><strong>3. Build it from scratch by coding.&nbsp;</strong>Just don't do this. Some people might say it's the best way because you can do whatever you want without depending on third-party platforms. However, building a website from scratch takes a lot of time and requires a never-ending effort to maintain, and if you're not the programmer who built it, you will rely on a programmer's goodwill for the rest of your life.</p><p>Not sure which one to pick? Go for Wix, or Shopify if you need e-commerce. These are cheap, SEO-friendly, and you can easily switch to other platforms in the future if needed.&nbsp;</p><h3>What should your website look like?</h3><p>A website should be a place where people considering donating, hiring, or otherwise engaging will find the information they need to make their next move. Contrary to what most inexperienced people think, a website shouldn't talk about your organization. Instead,&nbsp;<strong>it should talk about the problems your organization seeks to solve</strong>, and how the organization can contribute to this purpose. To be effective as a marketing asset, anything beyond that should be considered a detail on your website, not the core message.&nbsp;</p><p>Your website could have multiple pages or one page. I personally like the one-page option because, in my experience, it's easier to build, it provides a better experience for the user (who won't need to switch pages all the time), and it forces the company to be concise and straightforward in its messaging.&nbsp;</p><p>It's hard to suggest what kind of information a website should have because this is highly specific to each organization's model, audience, and sometimes even legal requirements.&nbsp;</p><p>However, here's the minimum structure an effective and compelling website should have:</p><ol><li><strong>Unique Value Proposal:&nbsp;</strong>What your organization does and how it's different from everyone else. \"<i>We help you choose an impactful career in AI.\"</i></li><li><strong>What it is:&nbsp;</strong>Explain in more detail what your organization does.&nbsp;<i>\"Every year, we organize an in-person boot camp in which you will learn about the most pressing problems in AI, and the best opportunities based on your context.\"</i></li><li><strong>Next steps:&nbsp;</strong>Explain in a concise way (icons are great in this case) what are the next steps for people who are interested in what you do.<i> 1) Apply by filling out the form at the end of this page, 2) Read the materials we send you by email, 3) Wait for a response within 2 - 3 days.&nbsp;</i></li><li><strong>Benefits:</strong> What are the benefits you're offering?&nbsp;<i>By joining our program, you'll&nbsp; get to know people who are also interested in working in AI, plus receive mentorship from some of the greatest thought-leaders on career, technology, and AI.</i></li><li><strong>Social proof:&nbsp;</strong>What have people and media outlets said about your organization?<i> Testimonial from a former student: \u201cI joined the 2022 boot camp and it completely transformed the way I think about my career. It also provided me with the information, resources, and connections I needed to land my first job in AI.\u201d</i></li><li><strong>Call-to-action:&nbsp;</strong>Invite the reader to take the next step, whatever you think it should be (contact your organization, support by donation, read specific material, etc.).&nbsp;<i>Fill out the form below to apply now.&nbsp;</i></li></ol><p>For inspiration, I recommend checking out the websites below. They do not necessarily follow the script above, but they do a great job of being compelling and concise.</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.non-trivial.org/\"><u>Non-Trivial</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.givedirectly.org/\"><u>GiveDirectly</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://effectivethesis.org/\"><u>Effective Thesis</u></a></li></ul><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tJTxDqjO4vg\"><u>Here is a great video by YCombinator</u></a> on how to make your website more conversion-oriented.</p><p>In this second week, you should focus your effort on building your website. It sounds like an impossible task if you're worrying about building the perfect website, but keep in mind that in the beginning it won\u2019t receive enough visitors to justify spending too much energy on it.</p><h2>Week 3 - Setting up your presence on the Internet</h2><p>You may have the best productand website out there, but the Internet is a vast place, and the odds of someone stumbling on your website by chance are extremely low.&nbsp;</p><p>In order to be found, you must be where most of the people using the internet are: search engines and social media.&nbsp;</p><p>When we talk about search engines, we're basically talking about Google, since it owns over 90% of the global searches, but the tips below pretty much apply to every other search engine out there.&nbsp;</p><p>To appear on Google search results, you have three alternatives:</p><p>- Google Paid Results (Ads)</p><p>- Google Organic Results</p><p>- Google My Business</p><p>Google ads and organic results will have their own dedicated weeks, so let's skip them for now.&nbsp;<strong>Google My Business is extremely important,</strong> but I'm frequently surprised to find businesses that don\u2019t have a My Business account.</p><p>What is Google My Business? It's the box about your business that appears on the search page, containing details about it, reviews, location and more. It basically tells Google your business exists.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EJRL8pKRTYdH2KZ9R/mm9zxxukzkbbvjuzh8bh\"></p><p>After&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/business/\"><u>creating your profile</u></a>, make sure to add as much information and images as you can, and ask supporters for reviews. The more reviews you have, the greater your chance of ranking in first place when someone searches for your organization's name or services.&nbsp;</p><p>Besides search engines, it's also wise to have a profile on the main social media sites: Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok and Twitter.&nbsp;</p><p>You don't need to post on these social media platforms for now, but having your profile there, with all the information about your business and your logo, will guarantee that people will find your company when they search for it in these specific channels. This transmits credibility and prevents malicious individuals from creating fake pages in the future.&nbsp;</p><h2>Week 4 - The technical setup for tracking</h2><p>This is a boring but necessary week.&nbsp;</p><p>In order to analyze what's working and what's not working (and why it's not working) in your marketing efforts, it's important to&nbsp;<strong>set up the tracking mechanisms and tools on your website</strong>. These tools will allow you to analyze who is visiting your website, where they are coming from and what they're doing, therefore allowing you to make data-driven decisions.</p><p>This setup is fairly easy, even for non-coders, but if you're totally averse to code, you may want to outsource the implementation. I'll list the steps below, but as I mentioned at the beginning of this article, I'll link to official tutorials so I can be sure that they'll be up to date at the time you're reading this.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> If any of the tutorials below sounds confusing, you may find it useful to search for a specific tutorial for the platform you're using to build your website. For instance,&nbsp;<i>\"how to set up Google Tag Manager on Wix\"</i>.&nbsp;</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6103696?hl=en\"><u>Create a Google Tag Manager Account</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/6103696?hl=en\"><u>Add the Google Tag Manager implementation code on your website</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/9304153?hl=en\"><u>Create a Google Analytics 4 (GA4) account</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://support.google.com/tagmanager/answer/9442095?hl=en\"><u>Install GA4 account on your website through Google Tag Manager</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1710077379203657?id=180505742745347\"><u>Create your Meta Business account</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1021909254506499\"><u>Create a Meta Pixel and install it on your website through Google Tag Manager</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a426102\"><u>Create a Linkedin Ads account</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/help/lms/answer/a416960\"><u>Create a Linkedin Insight Tag and install it on your website through Google Tag Manager</u></a></li></ol><p>You'll want to have set these up before driving people to your website.&nbsp;</p><h2>Week 5 - Running your first Google Search campaign.&nbsp;</h2><p>Congratulations! You've made it to the fifth week, which means you have a preliminary understanding of your audience, a presence on the internet, and the setup you need to make well-informed decisions in the short-term future.</p><p>Now it's time to generate website visitors, contacts (leads), and potential customers by running your first ad on a Google search campaign.</p><p>But why ads, and why Google Search ads?</p><p>Although there are many channels and strategies to generate contacts and customers, very few will give you the control and the leverage to put your organization in front of thousands of people in the short term.&nbsp;</p><p>Take for instance SEO (Search Engine Optimization), which consists basically of creating relevant content for what people search and hoping that Google ranks your website among the first results, so you get the clicks.&nbsp;</p><p>Assuming you find a good opportunity for a keyword (high volume and low competition), it will take you months or years to get a significant amount of clicks to figure out if this keyword has the potential to generate results in your organization.</p><p>And even if you get there, it will be very difficult to scale (since you depend on people searching for this keyword), and you'll still deal with the risks of Google changing your position on the search page due to an algorithm update or a competitor doing a better job.&nbsp;</p><p>A similar logic applies to referrals, influencer marketing, PR, organic social media and many other channels. They are worth considering, but in the beginning, they're not moving the needle for you.&nbsp;</p><p>That being said, let's start your Google Search campaign. The steps are pretty straightforward, and there are thousands of really good tutorials out there, but here is a quick guide (I'm linking tutorials to each step).</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/6366720?hl=en\"><u>Create your account on Google Ads</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.optimizesmart.com/how-to-set-up-conversion-tracking-in-google-analytics-4/\"><u>Set up your conversions on GA4</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.optimizesmart.com/how-to-import-conversions-from-ga4-property-to-your-google-ads-account/\"><u>Import your conversions from GA4 to Google Ads&nbsp;</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMUawhBMp64\"><u>Create your Performance Max campaign</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5TeJNQpaaS0\"><u>Create your Search campaign</u></a>.</li></ol><p>Johnstuart Winchell, founder of Good Impressions, also put together a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1i17-7eCbxYnjZX3vVq0U8lMjxeFrOwSCI2KizlD6bgQ/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>comprehensive guide on how to use your Google Ads grants in four simple steps</u></a>. This might be useful even if you don't have access to these&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.com/grants/\"><u>Google Ads Grants</u></a>.</p><p>Once your campaign is set up, it will take a few hours to be approved and start running. Don't worry about optimizing it for now, even if it's not generating the results you expect \u2014 we'll come to that next week.</p><p>Regarding budget, I recommend starting with US$20/day for each campaign. Less than that can slow down your learning curve, or prevent your ads from running depending on the competitiveness of your niche, and more than that is simply unnecessary spend at this point.&nbsp;</p><h3>(Optional) Running your first Meta and LinkedIn ad</h3><p>If you're selling something that people might be tempted to buy, but they're not proactively searching for it on Google, running ads on Meta (including Instagram) and LinkedIn may be a good fit for your marketing strategy.</p><p>Products linked to aesthetics and social status tend to do better in this case (e.g. clothes, beauty products, electronics, toys, food), but I've seen all kinds of products and services doing well, especially on Meta Ads. So, even if your product is totally different from these examples, I would give it a try.&nbsp;</p><p>The process of creating your ads on Meta or LinkedIn is very similar to Google's process. The main difference relies on the need for images and/or videos. Hootsuite has good beginner's guides for both:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/how-to-advertise-on-facebook/\"><u>Meta Ads Tutorial</u></a></li><li><a href=\"https://blog.hootsuite.com/linkedin-ads-guide/\"><u>Linkedin Ads Tutorial</u></a></li></ul><p>If it's the first time you're running a Meta or Linkedin Ad, I recommend investing US$ 10/day.&nbsp;</p><h2>Week 6 - Building an optimization routine</h2><p>Optimization is the process of planning, implementing, analyzing, and repeating the cycle continuously so your campaigns are always well-tuned to what works for your business.&nbsp;</p><p>Although you don't see many tutorials about optimization (because tutorials about creating the campaign are more compelling), I would say it accounts for 90% of the results you're going to get through ads.</p><p>Each ad platform will have its own terminology and technical differences. Things can get more or less complex depending on your product and tracking setup, but roughly, an optimization routine consists of:</p><ul><li>Deactivating your ads with lower performance and allocating the budget to ads with higher performance.&nbsp;</li><li>Experimenting with new ad types (conversion, audience, video views, etc).</li><li>Experimenting with new audiences, such as young adults interested in AI, custom audiences based on your website visitors (known as \"lookalikes\"), women in their 50s interested in technology, etc.</li><li>At a more advanced level, optimization strategies (max. conversions, target cost-per-action, etc).&nbsp;</li></ul><p>The frequency of this cycle should be at least weekly, but if you're investing more than US$ 2000 monthly, I recommend doing it twice a week. Doing it daily is rarely beneficial, since most changes will take a few hours to start running and probably a few days to get a sample significant enough to draw any conclusions.&nbsp;</p><h2>Week 7 - Content marketing and SEO</h2><p>If you\u2019ve done everything I\u2019ve suggested so far, you may be already seeing an increase in website traffic \u2014 maybe even getting a few contacts. Keep optimizing your process, and your odds of success will increase over time.&nbsp;</p><p>Now it's time to think a little bit longer term by focusing on audiences you want to reach, but that are not necessarily searching or even interested (yet) in what you're offering.&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EJRL8pKRTYdH2KZ9R/rtrq5ho9chod19dp5flq\"></p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><p>This pyramid represents how marketers sort their audience into \u201cconsciousness levels\u201d, representing how aware they are of your product and the problem it solves.&nbsp;</p><p>Everything we've done so far has been focused on the top layer \u2014 people who are not actively searching but would be interested in your solution.</p><p>A lot of organizations are able to thrive by focusing their marketing efforts only on this top consciousness level. However, this becomes a problem when:</p><p>a. What you offer is not known: people can't search for or desire something they don't even know exists.</p><p>b. You've reached everyone you could in this first layer; to keep growing your impact, you need to reach people in other layers.&nbsp;</p><p>To deal with these scenarios or prevent them from happening at all, the best approach is to develop a broad&nbsp;<a href=\"https://contentmarketinginstitute.com/getting-started/\"><u>content marketing strategy</u></a>.</p><p>Simply put, content marketing is a strategic marketing approach that involves creating and distributing valuable, relevant, and consistent content to attract and engage a target audience.&nbsp;</p><p>The primary goal of content marketing is to build trust, establish authority, and ultimately drive profitable customer or supporter actions, such as donations or participation in a cause. But it's also the \"raw material\" to effectively build a presence on search engines and drive people interested in the relevant topics to your organization.</p><p>Of course, Content Marketing is a huge topic, and it would be naive for me to even try to talk about everything involved in this type of strategy. However, here is a practical checklist to help you implement Content Marketing in your wider marketing strategy:</p><p>1. First, use Ahrefs, SEMRush, or Moz to research at least 4 keywords that your target audience may be searching for. These should have a global search volume of over 1,000 searches per month, and preferably an SEO difficulty up to 50.&nbsp;</p><p>2. Then, create a high-quality blog post related to each one of these keywords - make sure to follow these&nbsp;<a href=\"https://yoast.com/seo-friendly-blog-post/\"><u>SEO good practices for blog posts</u></a>. There is no consensus about how much content you need, but I recommend aiming for at least one post a week for the first year.&nbsp;</p><p>Repeat the process of researching keywords and creating high-quality, SEO-friendly content at least on a quarterly basis. The more high-quality content you publish, the higher your chances of getting a significant amount of organic traffic to your website and the more authority you build for your organization.&nbsp;</p><p>Here is what an SEO-focused content plan to tank for \"artificial intelligence\", for instance, should look like:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EJRL8pKRTYdH2KZ9R/mn3hlor3f7wohrpbwbot\"></p><p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VPgRzj3KcEtrdxInsX02SwZqGIQ6lb6lxG82JzbJCcs/edit?usp=sharing\"><i><u>Click here to open it in Google Sheets</u></i></a></p><p>As I said, Content Marketing is a complex topic. Social media, influencer marketing, referrals, and dozens of other strategies are included under its umbrella. Since we're focusing only on the first 8 weeks, having content marketing for your blog in place is a good start.</p><p>If you have gone through the basics of Content Marketing and want guidance on the next steps, please don't hesitate to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://igorscaldini.com/\"><u>reach out</u></a>.</p><h2>Week 8 - Building your funnel report</h2><p>So far, we've talked about how to implement powerful marketing tactics in your organization.But how do you know all this effort is paying off, or at least moving to a place in which it will pay off?&nbsp;</p><p>There are a lot of ways to measure your marketing efforts, and if you're a data analytics enthusiast interested in digging into methodologies and tools, I recommend looking into&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.impactmybiz.com/blog/business-intelligence-marketing-explained/\"><u>business intelligence applied to marketing</u></a>.</p><p>One of the most useful visualizations \u2013 and my favorite \u2013 is the&nbsp;<strong>funnel report</strong>. It's basically a graph which shows the absolute number of hits at each phase of your user's journey and the conversion rate of each phase. Here is an example:</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EJRL8pKRTYdH2KZ9R/tfvsbzrgumfpnwdntmfv\"></p><p>Source:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://support.mindbodyonline.com/s/article/Sales-Funnel-Analytics-report?language=en_US\"><u>mindbodyonline.com</u></a></p><p>You can customize your funnel with different steps, but keep in mind that you want to use this type of report to quickly spot bottlenecks, so you and your team should look at this report at least once a week and answer the following questions:</p><ol><li>Where is your organization losing most of your leads?&nbsp;</li><li>How can your organization increase the conversion rate of each phase?</li></ol><p>By monitoring this report weekly, you won't only be able to see the numbers, but also to&nbsp;<strong>prioritize what matters</strong>. For instance, if your biggest loss is between \"signing up\" and \"completing the profile,\" there is no point in spending energy increasing the CTR (clickthrough rate) of website visitors to click on Sign Up.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>An important consideration is that you won\u2019t get 100% conversion at any step - that's why it's a funnel. It's natural to lose people along the funnel, and each step will have its own benchmark.</p><p>For instance, a conversion rate of 20% from people visiting the website to creating a new account is pretty good for most businesses. Meanwhile, the same 20% conversion rate from people starting a checkout to finishing it would be considered low.&nbsp;</p><p>Benchmarks will vary according to your industry, business model, and target audience, so I recommend searching for these within your context.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are asking for donations, search for the average conversion rate of online donations. If you're running ads on Google to advertise your eBook on AI Safety, search for the average CTR for this type of ad.</p><p>Unfortunately, you won't always find a benchmark for your context, so the closer you get, the better. Besides that, keep in mind that you'll end up creating your own benchmarks as long as you keep experimenting.&nbsp;</p><p><i><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/EJRL8pKRTYdH2KZ9R/ogpqf2o7mpish21nz3rt\"></i></p><p><i>Source:&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://www.smartinsights.com/internet-advertising/internet-advertising-analytics/display-advertising-clickthrough-rates/\"><i><u>smartinsights.com</u></i></a></p><h2>Going beyond: planning for success</h2><p>Marketing is a process, not a project, and although there are ways to use it to boost your organization's growth in the short term, most of its benefits manifest in the long term.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, I've seen many organizations getting stuck with their marketing efforts due to what I call \"operational issues.\" These are issues that aren't related to marketing itself but its implementation and sustainability.</p><p>So here are a few guidelines I suggest adopting in your organization.&nbsp;</p><p>First, it's important to&nbsp;<strong>frame marketing as a learning process, not a \"one-shot\" attempt to make it work</strong>. Having this mindset will not only help your organization find the right strategy but also prevent the team and stakeholders from losing faith in marketing when things don't go as expected, especially during the first experiments.</p><p>Literally every successful marketing team I know runs marketing as a kind of infinite loop of PDCA (plan, do, check, act).&nbsp;</p><p>Another good practice is to&nbsp;<strong>establish clear communication guidelines</strong> beforehand. This should include brand messaging (what do we want to communicate as a brand?) and quality standards (what is quality for us and what level of quality is expected?).</p><p>Having these things defined prior to running an ad campaign, for instance, will allow tasks to flow more easily and ensure quicker turnaround times \u2014 for instance, your team won\u2019t need to wait two weeks for someone to approve which specific term to use or which shade of blue is prettier.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, try to&nbsp;<strong>arrange at least a monthly meeting</strong> to share the results and brainstorm insights with your team. Make it a ritual in which everyone can share their perspectives. Suggest changes AFTER the results have been presented so that everyone knows what has been working or not before suggesting further actions.</p><p>I'm obviously biased, but I\u2019ve seen marketing help organizations achieve amazing things for over a decade now. I sincerely hope you and your team are able to use it as a positive force to increase the impact your organization can have in society.</p>", "user": {"username": "Igor Scaldini"}}, {"_id": "wrA5xFAbRyttaQKdB", "title": "Why Did NEPA Peak in 2016?", "postedAt": "2023-12-01T16:18:58.917Z", "htmlBody": "<p>The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) is a 1970 law which requires all federal agencies to \u201c<a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/nepa/what-national-environmental-policy-act\"><u>prepare detailed statements assessing the environmental impact of and alternatives to major federal actions significantly affecting the environment</u></a>.\u201d The exact definitions of \u2018detailed,\u2019 \u2018major federal actions,\u2019 and \u2018significantly affecting the environment\u2019 have been hashed out over thousands of court cases where usually an environmental protection group like the Sierra Club will sue a federal agency for not being careful enough in their assessment.</p><p>Bureaucratic and judicial rulemaking have clarified that NEPA applies to any activity or decision that a federal agency spends money on or issues a permit for.

NEPA has chewed through the political capital of dozens of reform movements over the past several decades without much trouble. This graph from the National Association of Environmental Professionals shows that as each year passes from 2000-2017, environmental impact statements take a month longer to complete. The reform efforts during the Bush and Obama administrations don\u2019t seem to make a dent. In 2017 the average EIS took about 1800 days or 5 years to complete, with many EISs taking over 10 years or never finishing at all.</p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:728px\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wrA5xFAbRyttaQKdB/y9twtj6fimf9hnm5itr9\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wrA5xFAbRyttaQKdB/clu8mbkagyolnrcfqxre 424w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wrA5xFAbRyttaQKdB/ovgrh1292zudgxmnxf1x 848w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wrA5xFAbRyttaQKdB/c0mruodzk7rgldyy4imc 1272w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/wrA5xFAbRyttaQKdB/y9twtj6fimf9hnm5itr9 1456w\"></figure><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>A Light at the End of the Tunnel</h2><p>The last time the National Association of Environmental Professionals posted this graph was in 2018.

They haven\u2019t been this quick since 2011!</p><p>So after decades of getting worse and worse, NEPA may have finally turned a corner. But what explains this change?</p><h2>The FAST Act of 2015</h2><p>Buried deep in the massive omnibus budget authorization bill for the Department of Transportation, there is a section of \u201cFederal Permitting Improvement\u201d provisions. There are three main changes here.</p><p>First, it creates the <a href=\"https://www.paulhastings.com/insights/client-alerts/that-was-fast-congress-adopts-nepa-reforms-for-renewable-energy-projects-in-surface-transportation-bill#:~:text=To%20support%20this%20objective%2C%20the,six%20years%20to%20two%20years\"><u>Federal Permitting Improvement Steering Council</u></a>. Any energy infrastructure project which will cost over $200 million comes under the authority of this council. The council has a deadline of 180 days to complete environmental reviews for the projects they oversee, they coordinate all of the involved agencies to avoid redundant work, and they have employees who help the agencies complete their review documents on time.</p><p>Next, the FAST Act eases litigation pressure on environmental reviews in several ways. It shortens the statute of limitations from six years to two years, limits the pool of litigants to people who submitted detailed comments on the issue they are suing over when the EIS was in its draft period, and requires that courts consider the negative impacts of shutting down a project when they decide a case.</p><p>Finally, the Act establishes <a href=\"https://data.permits.performance.gov/\"><u>an online permitting dashboard</u></a> where timelines are tracked and agencies can coordinate.</p><h2>Caveats</h2><p>It\u2019s not certain how much credit the FAST Act should get for reducing NEPA timelines. All of the decrease in the timeline is coming in-between the Notice of Intent (when agencies publish their plan in the Federal Register) to the Draft EIS (when agencies open up the EIS to comments). So it might be that the FAST act is just pushing agencies to publish the Notice of Intent later in the preparation process.</p><p>Another important trend in the data is that the total number of EISs completed has been falling precipitously along with the time to complete them. In 2012, 197 final Environmental Impact Statements were published. Ten years later in 2022 there were only 83 with a clear downward trend throughout the whole period. In 2022 each EIS took about the same amount of time to complete as in 2012 but less half as many were completed.</p><p>If the FAST Act made environmental reviews less burdensome we would expect them to be quicker and more common. Quicker reviews but fewer of them suggests that the true burden of the reviews is being hidden or that federal agencies are being more selective with the projects that they even attempt to environmentally review, to avoid failing the deadlines set in the FAST Act.</p><p>More optimistically, the low numbers of EIS completions might just reflect the NEPA pessimism at its peak burden in 2016. The graph shows that the average EIS completed in 2021 took about 5 years to complete. That means the average EIS completed that year was started in 2016 when EISs were at their worst. Maybe as time goes on we\u2019ll see the EIS numbers increase as federal agencies realize that the FAST Act provisions really are making the environmental review process less burdensome.</p><p>NEPA is a longtime enemy of progress-minded folk. Any chink in its armor like the turnaround in 2016 is worth investigating further. But despite the encouraging trend reversal we saw on the graph, it doesn\u2019t seem like NEPA is getting unambiguously better.</p>", "user": {"username": "Maxwell Tabarrok"}}, {"_id": "aTrNEECgRPDWTM4Rw", "title": "Philosophers Against Malaria Fundraiser", "postedAt": "2023-12-01T16:12:47.073Z", "htmlBody": "<p>As in previous years, there\u2019s an end-of-year interdepartmental competitive&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.againstmalaria.com/FundraiserGroup.aspx?FundraiserID=8986\">fundraiser</a>&nbsp;for the Against Malaria Foundation.

However, present and future sentient non-humans, such as non-human animals and possible future digital minds could also be affected by the ASI\u2019s behaviour in morally relevant ways.

This ambitious value learning proposal would significantly reduce the likelihood of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/s-risk\">risks of astronomical suffering</a> from the ASI\u2019s behaviour, and thus we have very strong pro-tanto moral reasons in favour of implementing it instead of CEV. This fact is crucial in conducting an adequate cost-benefit analysis between different ambitious value learning proposals.</p><p><strong>Keywords:</strong><i>&nbsp; </i>The Alignment Problem \u00b7 Coherent Extrapolated Volition \u00b7 Suffering risk \u00b7 Sentientism \u00b7 Digital Minds \u00b7 Non-human Animals</p><p>Apart from humans, non-human animals, but also sentient digital minds may be very negatively affected by the behaviour of future AI systems.

Introduction&nbsp;</h1><p>The development of Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) (or Artificial General Intelligence poses serious existential and suffering risks (Bostrom, 2014; Yudkowsky, 2008; Sotala &amp; Gloor, 2017; Tomasik, 2015a; Baumann, 2017a). To prevent such catastrophes, we must solve the alignment problem. We must ensure that (if we do so) the first ASI we create has certain values so that it does not result in those outcomes and so that it does that which we intend it to do. The value specification problem is part of the more general alignment problem (Gabriel, 2020; Christian, 2020). It is the question of what values to align an ASI with, and it is where this paper will focus instead of other more technical issues such as inner alignment.&nbsp;</p><p>Non-human sentient beings, such as domesticated non-human animals, animals living in the wild and possible future sentient digital minds, have usually been neglected in discussions about what values should be implemented into the first ASI to prevent catastrophic consequences. However, all sentient beings matter and the interests of non-human sentient beings should also be taken into account in any value learning proposal.&nbsp;</p><p>In this paper, I contend that in a future in which we could both implement some of the standard ambitious value learning proposals or alternative value learning proposals that directly took into consideration the interests of sentient non-humans, we would have both strong and&nbsp;<i>very&nbsp;</i>strong pro-tanto moral reasons to do the latter. However, in practice, as laid out in Section 5, it is not completely clear which kind of ambitious value learning proposal would be best to try to implement. I turn to the example of Coherent Extrapolated Volition (CEV) one of the most popular ambitious value-learning proposals and argue that it is not ideal since there is (at least) a sufficiently non-negligible chance that by not sufficiently including all sentient beings, it may lead to risks of astronomical suffering as a result of the own ASI\u2019s actions. Although here I only focus on CEV, similar arguments to the ones that I use here, are also applicable to many of the other ambitious value learning proposals out there and I may discuss and analyze other ambitious value learning proposals in future research.&nbsp;</p><h1>2. Why the standardly proposed version of Coherent Extrapolated Volition is problematic<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h1><p><i>Coherent Extrapolated Volition (CEV)&nbsp;</i>is Eliezer Yudkowsky\u2019s value learning proposal of implementing into an ASI the goal of fulfilling what we (humans) would agree we would want if given much longer to think about it, in more ideal circumstances (Bostrom, 2014). That is, what we (humans) would wish \u201cif we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were, had grown up farther together; where the extrapolation converges rather than diverges, where our wishes cohere rather than interfere; extrapolated as we wish that extrapolated, interpreted as we wish that interpreted\u201d (Yudkowsky, 2004). See (Yudkowsky, 2004) for a more detailed explanation of the ideal circumstances required for adequate coherent extrapolation. Some, including (Yudkowsky, 2016) may argue that this would, in fact, be enough for the ASI to adequately take into account the interests of non-human sentient beings if they ought to be taken into account. Similarly, it has also been contended that animals\u2019 well-being is also included in humans\u2019 preferences and that this together with the less myopic decision-making of the ASI (compared to human decision-making), might be enough (Russell, 2019). It has also been held that it might be difficult to sustain that humans should build an ASI that cares about the interests of sentient non-humans directly since then it would care more about them than what humans actually do (Russell, 2019). According to these views, if it is indeed the case that&nbsp;<i>if&nbsp;</i>humanity had more time to think about it in ideal circumstances, it would have the goal of adequately taking into account their interests, then by coherently extrapolating humanity\u2019s volition the ASI would take into account the interests of sentient non-humans. I will argue this answer is not sufficiently satisfactory for us not to have strong reasons to try to directly include the interests of sentient non-humans in the ASI\u2019s goals if we are able to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>It has plausibly been argued that for any value learning proposal, there are some aspects of the proposal that cannot be left to the ASI to be figured out, such as \u2018standing, concerning whose ethics views [or morally relevant interests] are included; measurement, concerning how their views [or morally relevant interests] are identified; and aggregation, concerning how individual views [or morally relevant interests] are combined to a single view that will guide AI behaviour\u2019 (Baum, 2020). As it has been argued, the alignment problem has an essentially normative component, different kinds of technical solutions could be used for loading certain values into the reward function of a future A(S)I likely have different implications on exactly what kind of values we can implement, and thus, \u201cthere is no way to \u2018bracket out\u2019 normative questions altogether\u201d (Gabriel, 2020). Ultimately, the designers of the A(G)I that may become an ASI, cannot abstain from facing ethical decisions regarding in what way, what and whose values or morally relevant interests they include in the ASI\u2019s goals. I contend that we should take seriously the possibility that Yudkowsky\u2019s popular proposal does not adequately take into account moral considerations pertaining to the moral considerability of sentient non-humans.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though the standard CEV proposal adequately avoids directly specifying the values that should guide the ASI\u2019s behaviour (and as a consequence plausibly avoids substantial value lock-in), it nonetheless specifies which sentient beings have their volitions coherently extrapolated. The standard proposal only includes presently existing humans. In this sense, the standard CEV proposal excludes all other sentient beings and gives a specific answer to the standing problem. I contend that there are very strong reasons to suggest that CEV\u2019s standardly proposed solution to the standing problem is much more morally undesirable than an ambitious value learning proposal that takes the interests of all sentient beings more into account. From now forward I will refer to this kind of alternative proposal that I will further develop in Section 3 as&nbsp;<i>Sentientist Coherent Extrapolated Volition (SCEV)</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>CEV excludes the volitions of sentient non-humans from the extrapolation base, in section 2.1. I will show why their mere exclusion is unjustified in the same way that it would be unjustified to exclude groups of humans. This in itself gives us strong moral reasons to implement SCEV instead of CEV if we are able to do so. However, in section 2.2. I contend that we have&nbsp;<i>very&nbsp;</i>strong moral reasons to do so. There is (at least) a non-negligible probability that an adequate implementation of the standard CEV proposal results in the ASI causing or allowing the occurrence of risks of astronomical suffering (s-risks). These are risks of events that bring about suffering in cosmically significant amounts, vastly exceeding all suffering that has existed on Earth so far (Sotala &amp; Gloor, 2017; Althaus &amp; Gloor, 2016). \u201cSignificant\u201d here means relative to expected future suffering (Althaus &amp; Gloor, 2016). Taking the badness of s-risks into account, this non-negligible probability is sufficiently large for CEV to be a much more undesirable solution to the value specification problem than SCEV.&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to note and keep in mind that the reasons in favour of SCEV that I present and discuss in this section and throughout this paper are pro-tanto in the sense that (as discussed in Section 5) they could be overridden or defeated by other pro-tanto reasons against the implementation of SCEV. As a result, it may not be clear whether trying to implement SCEV instead of CEV is the right choice all things considered.&nbsp;</p><h2>2.1. Why we would have strong moral reasons to implement SCEV instead of CEV: an analogy with CEO-CEV and men-CEV&nbsp;</h2><p>To see why it is unjustified for sentient non-humans to be excluded from the extrapolation base, we can look at different alternative (and fictional) CEV proposals. Take, for example, the&nbsp;<i>CEO-CEV&nbsp;</i>proposal: the proposal of only applying CEV, that is, of only coherently extrapolating the volition, of the CEO of the research lab that first develops ASI or AGI. Or, for example, take the&nbsp;<i>men-CEV&nbsp;</i>proposal of only coherently extrapolating men\u2019s volitions. These would clearly be substantially more morally undesirable ambitious value learning proposals to employ in comparison to CEV if we could choose to implement any one of them. We have strong reasons against only coherently extrapolating the volitions of a small subset of humans that is unrepresentative of humanity as a whole. Probably the most plausible reason against pursuing such paths as ambitious value learning proposals (if the possibility of implementing normal CEV is present) is that there is clearly (at least) a sufficiently large non-negligible probability that these proposals would result in the ASI\u2019s behaviour having negative consequences for the humans not directly included in the extrapolation base of the CEV. People who are not men or people who have sufficiently different preferences from the AI lab CEO\u2019s preferences could find themselves in a post-ASI world where their interests are not sufficiently taken into account, and as a result, suffer negative consequences. Their interests could be very neglected as a result of only being present in the ASI\u2019s utility function to the extent to which men or the AI lab\u2019s CEO cared about them once they thought enough about them in ideal circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though it is possible that if the AI lab\u2019s CEO or men had sufficient time to think under the ideal conditions, then, they would want to take equally into account the interests of the people outside the extrapolation base as much as theirs, we still would not accept these proposals as adequate proposals for ambitions value learning compared to normal CEV. Because there is a sufficient likelihood that this possibility does not turn out to be the case. Whilst these value learning proposals might plausibly be better than not implementing any values into the ASI, they are significantly worse than CEV because there is a sufficiently large non-negligible probability that they would result in substantial negative consequences for the people excluded from the extrapolation base in each case. This would give us strong reasons to rule out CEO-CEV and men-CEV in a decision-making situation where we could also choose to implement the normal CEV proposal that takes all humans into account.&nbsp;</p><p>I contend that for similar kinds of reasons, CEV is also an inadequate proposal in comparison to SCEV. The normal CEV proposal, like CEO-CEV and men-CEV, excludes a subset of moral patients from the extrapolation base. It excludes all sentient non-human beings. And as in the previous examples, if CEV were to be adequately implemented, the interests of sentient non-humans would only be in the ASI\u2019s utility function and would only be taken into account to the extent to which humans cared about them once they thought enough about them in ideal circumstances. Sentient non-humans are moral patients, they could be affected in morally undesirable ways, as could the people excluded from the extrapolation base in the previous examples. This could occur as a mere result of their interests not being sufficiently important to the individuals in the extrapolation base even if they had enough time to think about it under ideal circumstances. This is why if we were able to do so, instead of implementing CEV, we would have strong moral reasons to implement SCEV: a proposal that took the interests of all sentient beings adequately into account. Below, in Section 4, I address two possible objections that contend that there is a relevant difference between excluding other humans and excluding sentient non-humans.&nbsp;</p><h2>2.2.&nbsp;Why we would have very strong moral reasons to implement SCEV instead of CEV: significantly reducing risks of astronomical suffering&nbsp;</h2><p>We do not only have&nbsp;<i>strong&nbsp;</i>moral reasons to implement SCEV instead of CEV. There are further reasons to believe that the difference in expected negative consequences between implementing CEV instead of SCEV is much larger than the difference in expected negative consequences between implementing CEO-CEV or men-CEV instead of CEV. If we could do so, we would have much more pressing reasons to aim for SCEV instead of the standard CEV proposal, than the reasons we have to aim for the standard CEV proposal instead of CEO-CEV or men-CEV. Then, if we could do so, we would have&nbsp;<i>very&nbsp;</i>strong moral reasons to implement SCEV instead of CEV.&nbsp;</p><h3>2.2.1. The greater lack of moral consideration for sentient non-humans<i>&nbsp;</i></h3><p>It is likely that any given group of humans (without any particular psychosocial conditions) cared much more about the interests of the rest of humans if they had enough time to think about it under ideal circumstances than, the extent to which all humans would care about the interests of all sentient non-humans if they had enough time to think about it under ideal circumstances. It is likely that in the first case the humans in the extrapolation base granted much more consideration to the humans outside the extrapolation base, than the amount of consideration that, in the second case, all humans would grant to sentient non-humans outside the extrapolation base.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, we cannot be sure that is the case since we do not specifically know how coherently extrapolating the volitions of any subset of or all humans would work in practice. And we do not know with certainty what any subset of or all humans would agree that they want, if given much longer to think about it, in more ideal circumstances. However, it is not the case that we can say nothing about which outcomes from different types of CEV are more or less likely. Indeed, we can say something. For instance, humans tend to have much more consideration for those who are closest and more similar to them (Caviola et al., 2018; Dhont, Hodson, &amp; Leite, 2016), and this may affect the process of coherently extrapolating volitions in a negative manner for sentient non-humans. This is due to the fact that sentient non-humans, such as domesticated non-human animals, animals living in the wild and possible future digital minds are much more distant (in a broad social, emotional, cognitive, psychological and even spacial and temporal sense) to humans than other humans.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, we should also update on the fact that (at least partially) as a result of not equally taking into consideration the interests of all sentient beings, currently and in the past, humans have killed and caused immense amounts of unbearable suffering to an immense number of non-human sentient beings for the almost negligible benefit of taste pleasure. To see how much we should update on this fact, imagine possible worlds in which the AI lab\u2019s CEO or men caused immense amounts of suffering to the humans excluded from the extrapolation base in each case. And did so in proportional quantities to the amount of suffering that humans in this world cause to other animals. Imagine they did this via, for instance, torturing the humans outside the extrapolation base in each case. Imagine, that, as humans do to factory-famed non-human animals, they caused unbearable suffering to the humans outside the extrapolation base throughout their lives and killed almost all of them before they could even reach adulthood. In these possible worlds, we would have more reasons to believe that it is more likely that implementing CEO-CEV or men-CEV would lead to worse consequences than the ones we expect it to have in the actual world. Analogously, it seems plausible that it is significantly more likely that in this world, in a world where human psychology has (at least in part) led humans to commit atrocities, such as factory farming, to other non-human sentient beings, it is also the case that the standard proposal of CEV leads to more negative consequences for non-human sentient beings than in a world in which our human psychologies had not played a role in committing atrocities towards other sentient beings.&nbsp;</p><h3>2.2.2. The nature and different kinds of the worst outcomes: risks of astronomical suffering<i>&nbsp;</i></h3><p>As we have seen there is (at least) a non-negligible chance that the interests of sentient non-humans would be highly disregarded by an ASI with the implementation of the standard CEV proposal. And that the likelihood of this (whatever it is), is higher than the likelihood that the interests of the humans not included in the extrapolation base are highly neglected in an ASI-controlled future where only the volitions of some humans are coherently extrapolated. A civilization with an ASI with either of those kinds of ambitious value learning proposals is (at least somewhat) likely to want to expand and settle space and make use of advanced AI and simulation technologies. In such a future where the interests of sentient non-humans would be highly disregarded, there is a significant probability that sentient non-humans would suffer astronomically as a result of the actions the humans would want to take and would likely be taken by the ASI in following their CEV.&nbsp;</p><p>Wild animal suffering might be spread through the universe by such civilisations. This could be a result of direct panspermia or intentionally terraforming planets because of some of the humans\u2019 values to spread life through the universe or for their aesthetic enjoyment of nature (Tomasik, 2018; O'Brien, 2021). But if no preventive measures are put in place it may also occur as a result of not adequately decontaminating spaceships, which could result in some microbes or other living organisms being transported accidentally to other planets which could over the course of many years result in the emergence of sentient lifeforms in those planets. Since it is plausible that in the lives of these future non-human animals suffering would be very prevalent and possibly even predominate, as in most of the lives of currently existing non-human animals living in nature (Ng, 1995; Groff &amp; Ng, 2019; Tomasik, 2020; O'Brien, 2021) if this were to occur it could lead to astronomical amounts of suffering.&nbsp;</p><p>A civilization with an ASI that takes into account the interests of some or all humans but not those of sentient non-humans might also make abundant use of advanced AI and simulation technologies. This could either knowingly or accidentally result in astronomical amounts of suffering. An ASI that neglects the interests of artificial forms of sentience might accidentally create vast quantities of sentient subroutines. These are instrumentally valuable functions, subprograms, robot overseers, robot scientists or subagents inside the ASI\u2019s program and structure (Tomasik, 2019a). In the same way that the emergence of phenomenal experience and the capacity for suffering has plausibly been evolutionary instrumentally useful in guiding behaviour, it might be instrumentally useful for the ASI in controlling the behaviour of its internal process in order to achieve its goals. By undergoing a complex optimization process, the ASI might instrumentally value the creation of suffering as has done natural selection, a complex process optimizing for gene reproduction (Sotala &amp; Gloor, 2017).&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, an ASI-controlled civilisation where CEV is implemented and the interests of sentient non-humans are highly disregarded might also result in Mind Crime, the creation of vast quantities of digital minds in simulations, including suffering ones. It might create immense numbers of ancestor simulations of past human history, of natural environments or of possible future evolutionary paths for research purposes (Bostrom, 2014, pp. 125-26; Sotala &amp; Gloor, 2017). In many of these, if the simulations are sufficiently detailed and complex, \u201chuman\u201d digital minds and digital minds of both wild or domesticated non-human animals might emerge thus multiplying wild animal suffering and the subjective experiences of being factory-farmed (Tomasik, 2015b; Baumann, 2017a). It could also intentionally create or allow other humans to intentionally create simulations with a specially significant amount of suffering, for entertainment or to satisfy sadistic preferences. In wanting to explore all the space of possible minds it might also try to simulate various different distant, weird and alien forms of sentience compared to ours (Tomasik, 2015b). The possibility that any of these kinds of non-human sentient beings came to exist on immense scales and that their interests were neglected by the CEV-aligned ASI in power aggravates the risk of astronomical suffering.&nbsp;</p><p>And, as it has very plausibly been argued elsewhere, \u2018nearly all plausible value systems will want to avoid suffering risks and for many value systems, suffering risks are some of the worst possible outcomes and thus some of the most important to avoid\u2019 (Sotala and Gloor, 2017). On any value system that holds that it is very important to prevent undesired and intense suffering, it will be of extreme importance to prevent astronomical amounts of undesired and intense suffering. Then, it need not be the case that the likelihood of these outcomes is very high, for it to be of immense importance to prevent them. If there is a non-negligible or higher chance of the occurrence of s-risks it is still of great moral importance to reduce it since their occurrence would be extremely morally undesirable.&nbsp;</p><h3>2.2.3. Why (even without taking into account the higher disregard for their interests) sentient non-humans would more likely be the victims of s-risks<i>&nbsp;</i></h3><p>Due to differences between the kinds of beings that biological humans and sentient non-humans are, even if it were not the case that sentient non-humans are more likely to be disregarded, it would still be significantly more likely that sentient non-humans would be harmed much more by implementing CEV that disregarded their interests, than excluded humans by implement CEO-CEV or men-CEV that disregarded their interests. This is so because it is easier to cause astronomical suffering to sentient non-humans than it is to cause astronomical suffering to excluded (biological) humans.&nbsp;</p><p>An ASI can cause actions that result in astronomical suffering or it can allow actions by other agents that cause astronomical suffering. In both cases, whether the action is performed by the ASI or by other agents, the fact that the action results in astronomical suffering can be intentional to a greater or lesser extent. When the actions that result in astronomical suffering are maximally intentional, the agent that performs them wants to cause astronomical suffering, when they are maximally unintentional, the agent does not even know that they are causing astronomical suffering. In the middle areas of this scale of the intentionality and unintentionally of the action, there are cases in which the agent knows that they are causing astronomical suffering but acts anyway in order to achieve its goals, and there are cases in which the agent is uncertain about whether they are causing astronomical suffering but also acts anyway. There are a few characteristics that many kinds of sentient non-humans have which make it more likely and easier for them to endure astronomical suffering. Biological humans excluded in CEO-CEV or men-CEV lack these characteristics, and thus it is more difficult for them to be the victims of astronomical suffering. Here are some of the relevant differences:&nbsp;</p><p>\u25cf&nbsp;<i>Resource efficiency of reproduction or replication:&nbsp;</i>Plausably much fewer resources are required for suffering digital minds to be copied relative to the resources required to sustain them than the resources required for suffering humans to reproduce relative to the resources required to sustain them (Sotala, 2012; Shulman &amp; Bostrom 2021). This makes the agent causing the astronomical suffering more likely to intentionally replicate digital minds and more easy for them to do so unintentionally, than with (biological) humans.&nbsp;</p><p>\u25cf&nbsp;<i>Lack of intervention in sustaining a suffering population:&nbsp;</i>Plausablly less intervention is required to sustain a suffering population of digital minds or (biological) non-human animals living in nature than a suffering population of (biological) humans. In the former case, the agent causing the astronomical suffering can just let the suffering continue indefinitely (either more intentionally or more unintentionally). In the latter case, the processes of natural selection, predation, and r-selection in reproductive strategies continue without supervision and lack of intervention (either more intentionally or more unintentionally). However, more intervention is required in the biological human case to prevent them from trying to take control over that which causes them suffering, prevent them from trying to use resources to decrease the disvalue in their lives and increase the value in it and prevent them from trying to cease to exist via ceasing to reproduce or by suicide.&nbsp;</p><p>\u25cf&nbsp;<i>Uncertainty about the presence of suffering in some cases:&nbsp;</i>In the mentioned case in which the agent is uncertain about whether they are causing astronomical suffering but also acts anyway, they may not choose to act in such a way if they knew that they were causing astronomical suffering. It is (and might probably continue to be) much more unclear whether&nbsp;<i>certain&nbsp;</i>animals living in nature or&nbsp;<i>certain&nbsp;</i>possible digital minds are enduring suffering than whether a given (biological) human is enduring suffering. The latter one may be able to communicate this fact and resembles us much more, and thus would be less likely to be the victims in the cases the agent causing the suffering is uncertain about whether they are doing so.&nbsp;</p><p>All these factors together with the fact that (biological) humans would be less likely to be disregarded make it substantially less likely that they would be the victims of s-risks compared to the likelihood that sentient non-humans would be such victims in a future controlled by an ASI with an ambitious value leaning proposal that did not directly coherently extrapolate their volitions.&nbsp;</p><p>In conclusion, there are two ways of justifying why we would have pressing reasons to implement an ambitious value learning proposal such as SCEV instead of the standard CEV proposal if we were able to do so. On the one hand, in the same way that there are strong moral reasons to implement CEV instead of a proposal for ambitious value learning such as CEO-CEV or men-CEV, there are also strong moral reasons to implement SCEV instead of CEV. On the other hand, since there is (at least) a non-negligible chance that the interests of sentient non-humans are highly disregarded by an ASI with the standard CEV proposal, and in such a future where the interests of sentient non-humans are highly disregarded it is substantially likely that sentient non-humans suffer s-risks, there is (at least) a non-negligible chance that the implementation of the standard CEV proposal results in s-risks for sentient non-humans from the own ASI\u2019s actions. Since s-risks are plausibly the worst possible outcomes and extremely morally undesirable under plausible normative views, even a (at least) non-negligible chance of their occurrence is very bad. Then, the standard CEV proposal that excludes the immense majority of present and future sentient beings is very morally undesirable if a better alternative is available. This increased likelihood of s-risks from the ASI\u2019s behaviour due to implementing certain kinds of ambitious value learning (as I shall argue in the following section) can be significantly reduced by implementing a truly sentientist solution to the value specification problem.&nbsp;</p><h1>3. An alternative sentientist proposal for ambitious value learning<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h1><p>Here, I shall present Sentientist Coherent Extrapolated Volition, an ambitious value learning alternative to CEV. This proposal consists of coherently extrapolating the volitions of all currently existing and future sentient beings. That is, to include all moral patients in the extrapolation base of the CEV.&nbsp;</p><p><i><strong>Sentientist Coherent Extrapolated Volition</strong></i>: the goal of fulfilling what all (affectable i.e. present and future) sentient beings would agree that they want, if given much longer to think about it, in more ideal circumstances.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though this is very ambitious, the standard CEV proposal also is, even if it is a bit less so. And if the standard CEV proposal is in-principle doable, I see no reason to believe that this proposal is not in-principle doable as well. For the standard CEV proposal to be realized, it would have to be determined what humans\u2019 desires would look like if we knew more, thought faster, were more the people we wished we were and had grown up farther together among other things (Yudkowsky, 2014). This would require determining what we would want if we had different capabilities than the ones we currently have. It would require determining what we would value if we had superhuman capabilities in many respects, such as, among other things, not being affected by cognitive biases, and being able to process and comprehend more amounts and different kinds of information (Yudkowsky, 2014).&nbsp;</p><p>Concretely, this would or could consist of (among other things) creating a \u201cdetailed model of each individual mind, in as much detail as necessary to guess the class of volition-extrapolating transformations defined by \u201cknew more,\u201d \u201cthought faster,\u201d etc.\u201d (Yudkowsky, 2004). The objective would be to approximate and understand the kinds of idealised changes that each mind would undergo if volition-extrapolating upgrades (such as knowing more, and having more time to think) were performed on it. It is important to understand that the proposal is not for these volition-extrapolating upgrades to be directly performed by the ASI on the minds of the individuals included in the extrapolation base by physically intervening in their brains. Instead, the proposal would be to perform these changes on detailed models of the minds of all the individuals in the extrapolation base which would be generated by the ASI. Neither CEV nor SCEV proposes that the volition-extrapolating upgrades are directly performed on the minds of the individuals in the extrapolation base. This would just result in all of them (humans and non-humans) being suddenly and directly uplifted and enhanced to similar levels of cognitive capability as that of the ASI. Once the ASI had generated sufficiently detailed models of each individual mind, and had applied volition-extrapolating upgrades to each of these models, their resulting coherent preferences would be the ones that would guide the ASI\u2019s behaviour.&nbsp;</p><p>If with more advanced technology, these specific processes are in principle doable and understandable in human minds it is likely that they could also be done with more simple minds such as those of many non-human animals. And, it is also plausible that we could at least have a more-than-zero probabilistic approximation of what these idealized changes would look like for possible future digital minds after having undergone volition-extrapolating upgrades. Then, it seems likely that if the process required for coherently extrapolating the volitions of humans is theoretically possible, it is also so with the volitions of sentient non-humans. And even if we could not in practice reach a fully idealized state of extrapolation or a state of full coherence with and between (both human and non-human) volitions, what is relevant is that we get as close as we can to achieving these. Doing so would be much more preferable than a proposal that did not result in any coherence between volitions, and that did not extrapolate the volitions at all.&nbsp;</p><p>All present and future sentient beings, including humans, both domesticated and non-domesticated non-human animals and possible future digital minds, have goals by the mere fact of being sentient. At least, in the broadest sense possible, they have desires and preferences to have positive phenomenal experiences and be free from negative ones. And many of them might have goals much richer and more complex than these. All of these goals form part of each of their volitions, which could and should be coherently extrapolated. They could in principle be extrapolated as human volitions can even if many sentient non-humans possess certain cognitive capacities to a lesser degree than humans usually do. This is so because as with human volitions, we could also (among other things) determine the changes that different kinds of sentient non-human minds undergo when volition-extrapolating transformations are performed on them. Even if many sentient non-humans do not possess the capacity to do certain types of abstract thinking about their goals or reflect on their values, humans also do not possess the capacities necessary to determine the content of their extrapolated volitions. In both cases, volition-extrapolating transformations would enhance the capacities of both sentient humans and non-humans to adequately determine the content of their extrapolated volitions.&nbsp;</p><p>In modelling what changes in preferences would occur if volition-extrapolating transformations were applied to the volitions of existing non-human animals, such as squirrels, SCEV may arrive at models of extrapolated volitions with weird preferences. We currently have no idea what they would look like. However, this is not enough to suggest that we should not include squirrels or other non-humans in the extrapolation base. In fact, it has been argued that there are good reasons to uplift the (cognitive) capacities of non-human animals (at least) to similar levels than the ones had by most humans for democratic reasons (Paez &amp; Maga\u00f1a, 2023), for Rawlsian liberal-egalitarian reasons (Dvorsky 2008), and anti-speciesist reasons (Chan, 2009). And, as I will argue in Section 4.3. We have no good reasons to believe that implementing SCEV or enhancing their capabilities would cause them to cease to exist, but rather, can be done while preserving their identity (Paez &amp; Maga\u00f1a, 2023). Furthermore, as I show in Section 4.1. it is implausible to believe that including non-human animals in the extrapolation base could result in us being harmed by the weird preferences their extrapolated volitions might have. And thus, since, it remains the case that by not including them we are likely increasing the risk of astronomical suffering, we have strong reasons to do so even if we are highly uncertain about the content of their extrapolated volitions.&nbsp;</p><h2>3.1. A solution to the standing problem<i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></h2><p>Since, as mentioned above, we cannot leave the solution to the standing problem (the issue of whose interests or volitions are included in the extrapolation base) to be figured out by the ASI, we should take into account uncertainty when making such a decision ourselves. What is relevant in determining what entities should morally be taken into account, and thus, also be included in some way or another in the extrapolation base, is not whether or not we can be sure that they possess the relevant traits for moral patienthood. Against what Yudkowsky has contended, the fact that we could be wrong about whether a given entity deserves moral consideration is not a sufficient reason to exclude them from our moral consideration or form the extrapolation base (Yudkowsky, 2016). Instead, what is relevant is whether there is a non-negligible chance that they possess the relevant traits for moral patienthood. This is so because if there is some chance that a given entity can be harmed in morally relevant ways by our actions, it is wrong to perform those actions all else equal. Because some chance of harm is worse than no harm. Thus, what is relevant in determining which entities should be morally taken into account is whether there is a non-negligible chance that they are sentient (Sebo, 2018). Furthermore, as we have seen, being included or not in the extrapolation base can indeed directly affect the extent to which (in expectation) the interests of given beings are respected and taken into account by the ASI\u2019s behaviour. Then, all entities for which there is a non-negligible chance that they are sentient should be included in the extrapolation base. We have very strong reasons to believe that there is at least a non-negligible probability that almost all present and future humans, non-human animals and possible future digital minds are moral patients, and thus should directly be included in the extrapolation base. This is so because of three main reasons. First, there is a wide consensus and strong evidence on the sentience of vertebrate animals and many invertebrate animals (Low, 2012; Proctor et al., 2013; The Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare, 2007; Waldhorn, 2019a; Waldhorn, 2019b), and there is wide agreement that artificial entities, such as digital minds, with the capacity for sentience will or could be created in the future (Harris &amp; Anthis, 2021). Secondly, sentience in the sense understood above as the capacity of having positively or negatively valenced phenomenally conscious experiences is widely regarded and accepted as a sufficient condition for moral patienthood (Clarke, S., Zohny, H. &amp; Savulescu, J., 2021). And thirdly, it is also the case that it seems very plausible and it is also widely accepted that the intrinsic value of good things or bad things or the intrinsic moral importance of respecting and considering the interests of moral patients cannot be discounted solely because they occur in the future, see (Greaves &amp; MacAskill, 2021: p.18; Ord, 2020: p.52; Beckstead, 2013: p.18) for acceptance of this view in the literature. Then, all present and future entities for which there is (at least) a non-negligible chance that they are sentient should directly be included in the extrapolation base.&nbsp;</p><h2>3.2. How to include the extrapolated volitions of future not-yet-existing sentient beings<i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></h2><p>According to SCEV, apart from currently existing sentient beings, all future sentient beings should have their volitions directly included in the extrapolation base, since then the probability of s-risks from the ASI\u2019s actions would be significantly reduced. But, how exactly should the volitions of future not-yet-existing sentient beings be directly included in the extrapolation base? At any given point in time&nbsp;<i>t</i>, the ASI should take those actions that would in expectation most fulfil the coherent extrapolated volition of all sentient beings that exist in&nbsp;<i>t</i>. It is the case that many (or almost all) actions that the ASI could or would take would change the kinds and number of sentient beings that would exist after it had performed the given action(s). Due to this fact, after any given action the ASI would have to incorporate the extrapolated volitions of the new currently existing sentient beings if there are any, and then decide how to act again based on the coherent extrapolated volitions of all existing beings at that point in time.&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to realize that other kinds of proposals about how to take into account future not-yet-existing sentient beings, might have disastrous consequences. For instance imagine the following somewhat more straightforward proposal: the ASI should take those actions that would in expectation most fulfil the coherent extrapolated volition of all beings that would in expectation exist after its action. If this proposal were to be implemented, it would likely result in a reward hacking of the utility function. If the utility function of the ASI would be to maximize the fulfilment of the coherent extrapolated volition of all the sentient beings that would in expectation exist after its actions, then, the ASI could just create many digital minds with very simple extrapolated volitions to satisfy. If a sufficiently large number of these kinds of digital minds were created by the ASI\u2019s actions the force of their extrapolated volitions could be many orders of magnitude greater than the force of the extrapolated volitions of currently existing human and non-human animals in guiding the ASI\u2019s behaviour. This could result in the ASI disregarding sentient human and non-human animals and only performing those actions that would most satisfy the easy-to-satisfy preferences of the created digital minds. And these easy-to-satisfy preferences need not be preferences that seemed valuable to us (nor to our extrapolated volitions) in any respect. This alternative proposal of how to include future not-yet-existing sentient beings in the extrapolation base would likely lead to very undesirable outcomes. It is naive and flawed, because, at any given point in time it lets the ASI itself determine what new sentient beings come into existence (independently of the preferences of the extrapolated volitions of the already included individuals). Contrary to this, on the proposal I have put forward, what sentient beings come into existence, and shape the ASI\u2019s behaviour by being included once they come to exist, is entirely dependent on the preferences of the extrapolated volitions of the currently included individuals. Since the extrapolated volitions would know how SCEV works, they would be aware that in preferring a certain action or another they are also preferring the creation of some kinds of minds or others. Furthermore, they would also be aware that once they come to exist, they will be included in the extrapolation base and thus also affect the ASI\u2019s behaviour. Then, the extrapolated volitions would know better than to perform actions leading to scenarios similar to the one in which immense numbers of digital minds with invaluable and easy-to-satisfy preferences have been created and have complete control over the ASI\u2019s behaviour. Because of this, in the original proposal I uphold, the reward hacking is prevented.&nbsp;</p><p>This proposal would adequately take into account the interests of future sentient beings since, once they began to exist, their interests would directly be included in the ASI\u2019s utility function. Contrary to what seems to be the case in the standard CEV proposal, the interests of future not-yet-existing sentient beings, once they exist, would not be taken into account merely to the extent to which the extrapolated volitions of currently existing individuals desire to do so. And, by taking directly into account the interests of future sentient non-humans in this manner, the non-negligible chance of s-risks from the ASI\u2019s actions as a result of an adequate implementation of the standard CEV proposal would be significantly reduced.&nbsp;</p><p>The s-risks from the own ASI\u2019s actions are substantially lower when implementing SCEV because it is no longer the case that their prevention could only be caused by the extent to which humans who had their volitions coherently extrapolated cared about the suffering of the sentient non-human victims of the s-risks. Rather, the astronomical amount of volitions of the sentient non-humans themselves would directly be included in the extrapolation base. On this proposal, there still is (at least) a non-negligible chance that humans\u2019 extrapolated volitions would want to perform actions that would (without further intervention) lead to s-risks such as direct panspermia, or the use of simulation technologies. As a consequence, there is still some chance that these kinds of actions were actually performed by the ASI. However, once they were being performed, once new sentient beings such as non-human animals living in \u201cnatural\u201d environments on other planets or digital minds came into existence, their extrapolated volitions would be directly included in the extrapolation base. And since their volitions would be extremely opposed to suffering immensely, the ASI would almost certainly prevent the astronomical suffering. Once the would-be victims of s-risks were to come into existence, their interests in not suffering would be directly taken into account and reflected in the ASI\u2019s behaviour. The astronomical suffering would almost certainly be prevented by the ASI and it would as with any other beings already present in the extrapolation base, try to fulfil the extrapolated volitions of the new existing beings. If the volitions of future sentient non-humans were included in the extrapolation base, as SCEV proposes, the occurrence of s-risks from the ASI\u2019s actions (i.e. what it causes or allows) would almost become impossible. Therefore, we have very strong pro-tanto moral reasons to implement SCEV to guide the behaviour of a possible ASI instead of only coherently extrapolating the volitions of currently existing humans (a minority of all the affectable moral patients expected to exist).&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, it should also be noted that this proposal of SCEV (as CEV) is not intended as a realist theory of morality, it is not a description of the metaphysical nature of what constitutes the \u2018good\u2019. I am not proposing a metaethical theory but merely what would be the most morally desirable ambitious value learning proposal for an ASI. It is not the case that if moral realism is true, SCEV or CEV would necessarily arrive at this moral truth. Thus, (as CEV) SCEV and the arguments in favour of it are compatible both with a realist and an anti-realist conception of meta-ethics.&nbsp;</p><h1>4. Objections<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h1><p>In this fourth section, I shall present and respond to three possible objections against the (pro-tanto) rejection of CEV and my proposal of Sentientist Coherent Extrapolated Volition.&nbsp;</p><h2>4.1. The Risk from Predators\u2019 Violent Predispositions<i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></h2><p>Yudkowsky has contended that a reason against directly including sentient non-humans such as non-human animals in the extrapolation base is that it may result in consequences we do not like as a result of how different the non-human volitions are from ours (Yudkowsky, 2016). Then, it might be argued that it is not the case that SCEV is preferable to CEV since there is also the possibility that it might lead to very morally undesirable goals for the ASI to pursue, such as violent goals, since, for instance, many non-human animals living in the wild have goals and preferences in favour of predation. Given the very considerable degree of uncertainty we currently face regarding the exact nature of what would be CEV\u2019s extrapolation process in practice, we cannot completely rule out the possibility that this could have significant negative consequences. Then, it seems possible that the ASI could have weird, bad or violent goals as a result of some of the desires had by non-human animals living in the wild.&nbsp;</p><p>Even though it is true that we cannot be completely certain about this, I believe it is very plausible that this risk and its badness are very significantly lower than the s-risk from implementing the normal CEV proposal. When implementing CEV, the only possible preferences against sentient non-humans enduring astronomical suffering are those had by humans who to some extent care about the suffering of sentient non-humans. While, in implementing SCEV, all the volitions of the victims of the possible s-risks as a result of the violent preferences of predators, would count against the occurrence of such s-risks. By the mere fact of being sentient beings and being included in the extrapolation base, the volitions of the possible victims of such strange s-risks would primarily and almost entirely consist of the desire to prevent such suffering. Indeed as mentioned above, the desire to be free from immense amounts of intense and unbearable suffering is probably the strongest possible desire any sentient being can have, and thus since in an s-risk there would be astronomical amounts of beings having these desires, this would count extremely heavily against the occurrence of any kind of possible s-risks including the ones due to predatory dispositions.&nbsp;</p><p>Due to empirical uncertainty about what entities are sentient and black swans, it is likely that we can never be sure that the future occurrence of s-risks is completely impossible while sentient beings continue to exist and we expand through the universe or have sufficient computational power. But plausibly, one of the best ways to ensure that this does not happen would be to have an ASI that would truly take into consideration the interests of any of the victims of the possible s-risks. Demanding more certainty against the occurrence of s-risks than this is unwarranted, since it may indeed not be possible. Even if there is a very tiny probability that an s-risk could occur as a result of the predators\u2019 corrupted preferences, this probability is negligible. It would be unreasonable and too demanding to dismiss an ambitious value-learning proposal because it cannot with complete certainty rule out the possibility of the future occurrence of any kind of s-risk. And, since the probability and badness of the occurrence of bad outcomes as a result of predator\u2019s violent preferences is significantly lower than the (at least) non-negligible probability of the occurrence of s-risks as a result of implementing CEV, we would still have very strong reasons in favour of choosing SCEV if we could do so.&nbsp;</p><h2>4.2. Democratic illegitimacy and being jerkish<i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></h2><p>Another possible counterargument to the general project of this paper of arguing for the importance of including the interests of sentient non-humans to guide the behaviour of a future ASI is that doing so would be anti-democratic. Most people indeed would likely not want nor vote in favour of implementing a value alignment proposal that equally takes into account the interests of non-human sentient beings.&nbsp;</p><p>This argument, however, assumes that only humans have claims in favour of having their interests represented in democratic procedures. This might be a result of speciesist bias or as a result of holding the previously mentioned view that only the interests of moral agents matter in a morally relevant way. However, all sentient beings could be positively or negatively affected by an ASI and accordingly, all of them have claims in favour of having their interests taken into account. It is unreasonable to believe, as we have seen, that those interests could be adequately represented only to the extent to which currently existing humans that are moral agents care about them. Thus, in this case, the principle of the all-affected interests in democratic theory clearly applies (Christiano &amp; Sameer, 2022), and all sentient beings would have strong democratic claims in favour of having their interests directly represented.&nbsp;</p><p>This kind of objection is raised by Yudkowsky in a different manner. In his view, programmers or the implementors of a value learning proposal into an ASI should try not to be \u201cjerks\u201d. And in doing so they should try to be fair and take into account the preferences of people that do not want all sentient beings to be included, by not directly including all sentient beings in the extrapolation base. Doing so, in Yudkowsky\u2019s view, would not be impartial since it would be rooting for the preferences of people who, for instance, care more about non-human animals (Yudkowsky, 2016). Contrary to this, however, Yudkowsky holds that it would, in fact, be jerkish to not include humans who, as sentient non-humans, are powerless in relation to determining what value alignment proposal is implemented. These humans possibly include children, existing people who've never heard about AI or people with severe physical or cognitive disabilities unable to act on and express their own views on the topic.&nbsp;</p><p>However, as seen above, it is not the case that there are no reasons to include sentient non-humans since they too can be positively or negatively affected in morally relevant ways by being included in the extrapolation base or not. The fact that many of the parties that have some power over which value learning proposal is implemented (i.e. some humans) do not care about these reasons does not mean that they hold no weight. It is not completely clear what Yudkowsky means by \u201cjerkish\u201d or \u201cto be jerks\u201d, however, if it is to be understood colloquially, in the same manner, that it would be unfair and jerkish for powerless humans to be excluded, it is also unfair and jerkish for sentient non-humans to be excluded. Today, due to a certain amount of societal moral progress and expansion in the group of beings that society takes seriously into moral consideration, we tend to seriously include both powerful and powerless humans, and thus it seems intuitively jerkish to exclude them from the extrapolation base. But a few years ago it plausibly would not have felt this way. Imagine that the decision of which beings should be included in the extrapolation base had taken place many years ago. If they could do so, it would have been much more preferable that when considering what entities to include, these past decision-makers actually looked at the most plausible moral reasons in deciding what to do instead of doing that which was most socially and intuitively acceptable, which would have resulted in excluding many powerless humans. The same is preferable right now and in the future. If someone is able to decide what entities to include in the extrapolation base, they should look at the moral reasons in favour of including various kinds of entities even if they might not be the most intuitively or socially acceptable to include from the perspective of those in power. And as we have seen there are indeed strong reasons to include all sentient beings. A proposal that excludes sentient beings, then, is not impartial, but rather, would be a jerkish and unfair proposal.&nbsp;</p><p>Indeed, if Yudkowsky is right that it is important to exclude some sentient beings from the extrapolation base, this presumably is because the kinds and number of beings included in it can likely affect the ASI\u2019s behaviour. Then, this means that, in expectation, it is not the case that the interests of sentient non-humans would equally be taken into consideration in the ASI\u2019s behaviour independently of whether they are directly included in the extrapolation base or not.&nbsp;</p><p>Furthermore, Yudkowsky also contends that only including existing humans in the extrapolation base is more simple (Yudkowsky, 2016). While this is the case, it is not a reason in favour of the moral desirability of the proposal if we are able to successfully include all sentient beings. The fact that CEV is simpler than SCEV does not make it more morally desirable all else equal. Since doing nothing or only coherently extrapolating one volition is simpler than CEV but it is not more morally desirable.&nbsp;</p><p>Because of this, against the objection, it is not the case that pursuing this proposal would be anti-democratic, jerkish or unfair, but rather it would be a much more democratic, nicer and fair option. Implementing CEV instead of SCEV would not do justice to the direct democratic and moral claims of sentient non-humans.&nbsp;</p><h2>4.3. Would SCEV preserve the identity of sentient beings?<i><strong>&nbsp;</strong></i></h2><p>It has been argued that the implementation of CEV would produce undesirable results because it would cause humans to cease to exist (Yampolskiy, 2022). Roman Yampolskiy has argued that by implementing CEV \u201c[w]e would essentially agree to replace ourselves with an enhanced version of humanity as designed by AI\u201d, since, with the quick extrapolation jump involved in CEV, there would not be any continuity with our identity, and we would cease to exist (Yampolskiy, 2022). He presents the following argument: \u201cwe can say that current version of humanity is H\u2080, the extrapolation process will take it to H\u2081\u2080\u2080\u2080\u2080\u2080\u2080\u2080. A quick replacement of our values by values of H\u2081\u2080\u2080\u2080\u2080\u2080\u2080\u2080&nbsp;would not be acceptable to H\u2080&nbsp;and so necessitate actual replacement, or at least rewiring/modification of H\u2080&nbsp;with H\u2081\u2080\u2080\u2080\u2080\u2080\u2080\u2080, meaning modern people will seize to exist\u201d. This argument can also be applied to criticise SCEV. It is indeed the case that some sorts of radical enhancements to the capabilities of humans, animals and digital minds can cause them to cease to exist by not being identity-preserving. However, radical enhancements to the individuals in the extrapolation base need not occur at all by implementing SCEV, and if they do (as it has been argued) they could occur in ways that are identity-preserving and aligned with the good of each of the individuals (Bostrom 2008: p.123\u2013126; Paez &amp; Maga\u00f1a, 2023: p.23\u201325).&nbsp;</p><p>As Yampolskiy suggests, it is indeed the case that by performing volition-extrapolating upgrades to the models of the minds and volitions of the individuals in the extrapolation base, the resulting models will have different preferences and values from our own. However, this is in part what we are trying to accomplish when implementing a proposal such as CEV or SCEV, we are trying to prevent value lock-in (Yudkowsky, 2004; MacAskill, 2022). If we were to implement current values to direct the behaviour of an ASI, this would almost certainly constitute an immense moral tragedy, since all future generations would be stuck with antiquated values. It seems clear that it would have been a tragedy if past human civilizations from Ancient History or the Middle Ages locked in their values, and they persisted and were imposed for all of humanity\u2019s future by an ASI. Similarly, we should not believe that current values constitute the peak of moral progress and that there is no more progress to be made (Yudkowsky, 2004).&nbsp;</p><p>There would likely be a very significant distance between the values and preferences of the models of the coherently extrapolated volitions of sentient beings and the values and preferences of currently existing beings. However, since it prevents value-lock-in, the existence of this distance is preferable to its non-existence, and it would not cause currently existing beings to stop to exist. What would occur is that models of our minds and volitions would be created to guide the ASI\u2019s behaviour. These models would know more, reason better, and be more cooperative. As a result, they would necessarily have better justified, more coherent, and reasonable ethical views than the once we have. These better-informed, more thought-through and more justified ethical views would then guide the ASI\u2019s behaviour. It is implausible to believe, as this objection seems to imply, that what these better-informed, more thought-through and more justified ethical views would necessarily prefer is to kill all sentient beings and create new ones. One would only have reasons to believe that SCEV or CEV would recommend this if one already believes that killing all sentient beings or all humans and replacing them with new ones is what ought to be done. Disagreeing and discussing what ethical views or preferences would be had by the models is the same as discussing what ethical views are more reasonable, coherent, well-informed, etc. And the view that what ought to be done instead of any other physically possible option, is to kill all sentient beings and replace them with new ones is highly implausible and nowhere seriously defended. It is much more reasonable to believe that instead, the better-informed and more reasonable models could prefer for sentient beings not to be enhanced at all. Or could prefer that we could be enhanced in just, inclusive, equitable, autonomy-respecting and identity-preserving ways as it is prescribed by contemporary transhumanism (The Transhumanist Declaration, 2009; Savulescu &amp; Bostrom, 2009). If this were done, the enhancements performed need not cause current sentient beings to cease to exist, since, as it has been argued, radical enhancements can be identity-preserving both for human and non-human animals if certain conditions are met (Paez &amp; Maga\u00f1a, 2023: p.23\u201325).&nbsp;</p><p>There are two major sets of theories about the kind of entities sentient individuals are and about their persistence conditions over time (Paez &amp; Maga\u00f1a, 2023: p.23\u201325). On the Somatic account, sentient beings are living organisms, and their persistence over time consists in maintaining the integrity of their metabolic processes (Olson, 1997; van Inwagen, 1990). On this view, there would be ways of performing, radical enhancements both onto human and non-human animals that would preserve their identity, one could enhance many of their capabilities without disrupting their metabolic processes. This account is about individuals with a biological substrate and thus does not apply to digital minds. But an analogous account, applied to digital minds could claim that maintaining the integrity of certain physical structural features of the digital substrate would be necessary and sufficient for them to persist over time. An account like this would also allow enhancements to be compatible with the persistence of digital minds over time. On the other major account, the Psychological Account, sentient beings are psychological entities who continue to exist only if they have psychological continuity over time (DeGrazia 2005; McMahan, 2002; Parfit, 1984). As it has been argued (Bostrom 2008: p.123\u2013126), this account is also compatible with enhancements being identity-preserving if the following conditions are met: the changes are in the form of adding new capacities or enhancement of old ones, without sacrificing preexisting capacities. They are implemented gradually over an extended period of time, and the new capacities do not prevent the preexisting capacities from being periodically exercised. Furthermore, the subject retains her old memories and many of her basic desires and dispositions and the subject retains many of her old personal relationships and social connections. And finally, in the case of humans and some sufficiently cognitively sophisticated digital minds each step of the transformation process is freely and competently chosen by the subject and the transformation fits into the life narrative and self-conception of the subject (Bostrom 2008: p.123\u2013126). In the case of non-human animals and other digital minds who cannot freely choose and comprehend each step of the uplifting process, instead of these final conditions, \u201cone may, alternatively, require the uplifting process not to undermine their control over their lives, irrespective of whether animals [or digital minds] can understand that possibility\u201d (Paez &amp; Maga\u00f1a, 2023: p.23\u201325). This, then would not undermine their control over their existence but rather make it more robust. For a more developed discussion on why enhancements can be made compatible with non-human animals preserving their identity, see (Paez &amp; Maga\u00f1a, 2023: p.23\u201325) from where this paragraph is based.&nbsp;</p><p>Since we have good reasons to believe that radical enhancements to sentient beings can be identity-preserving, it is implausible to believe that instead of performing this kind of enhancements, if any, the more reasonable, coherent and well-informed ethical views had by the extrapolated models of sentient beings would prefer to kill all sentient beings by performing non-identity-preserving enhancement interventions instead. There are no good reasons to believe that this is preferable, and even if for some reason one were to believe so, it then would not constitute an objection to implementing SCEV, since, one would presumably prefer and welcome that which one believes to be preferable. The fact that SCEV would inscribe the values of S\u2081\u2080\u2080\u2080\u2080\u2080\u2080\u2080&nbsp;(to represent all sentient beings instead of only humans) into the behaviour of the ASI, does not imply either the replacement or rewiring/modification of S\u2080&nbsp;with S\u2081\u2080\u2080\u2080\u2080\u2080\u2080\u2080. Thus, we have no good reason to believe that SCEV would not preserve the identity of sentient beings.&nbsp;</p><h1>5. Why it is unclear whether trying to implement Sententist Coherent Extrapolated Volition is best all things considered<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h1><p>I have argued that there are strong pro-tanto reasons to implement SCEV instead of CEV if we could do so successfully due to the fact that it would significantly reduce the non-negligible chance of s-risks from the own ASI\u2019s behaviour that there is from an adequate implementation of CEV. However, in practice, it is not clear that these reasons are not overridden or defeated by other reasons against SCEV. In this section, I will lay out other possible pro-tanto reasons that go against trying to implement SCEV or a similar value learning proposal instead of implementing one which is closer to CEV.&nbsp;</p><p>First, there is the risk that the SCEV would not be implemented exactly as intended. When trying to implement SCEV there is always the possibility that we would not get everything right, and that, by accident, there could be unintended consequences. For some kinds of accidents from near misses that could occur, it seems plausible that the more morally desirable the ambitious value learning proposal, the worse the accidents that may result from trying to implement it. This is so because there are some possible kinds of near-miss accidents where the goals of the ASI identify those entities and things which can sustain value, but affect them in strange or bad ways contrary to desirable behaviour the ASI was intended to have as stipulated in the morally desirable ambitious value learning proposal. There are plausibly many possible ways in which these kinds of accidents could occur. One specific accident of this kind is if, through a value learning proposal such as SCEV, the interests of digital minds are taken into account and valued and as a consequence, many of them are created (as argued by Shulman &amp; Bostrom, 2021), but we accidentally do not weight their suffering adequately. It is possible that even if the SCEV proposal intended to care about the suffering of digital minds, it accidentally was not able to adequately detect suffering and disvaluble states that many forms of alien digital minds might suffer (Vinding, 2018; Tomasik, 2019b). Or that it may not adequately weigh their interests by accident. This could potentially result in astronomical suffering. Such a kind of accident would be less likely if a less morally desirable ambitious value learning proposal were implemented since it would be less likely to create astronomical amounts of digital minds with the potential of suffering astronomically by accident. Another possible accident of this kind is the case of SignFlip, where the ambitious value learning proposal identifies a very morally desirable target or goal to maximize, but, by accident, the opposite target or goal is maximized (Tomasik, 2019b). In the case of SCEV, this would consist of maximizing the opposite of the coherent extrapolated volition of all sentient beings which would be extremely morally undesirable. Since there is some probability of the occurrence of these kinds of accidents, and some of the badness of the accidents would be mitigated by implementing a less morally desirable value learning proposal instead of SCEV, this gives us some other reasons against trying to implement a value learning proposal such as SCEV which comes very close or completely captures that which we value.&nbsp;</p><p>There are also further reasons against trying to implement SCEV in practice related to relevant game-theoretic considerations in specific decision-making situations. One possible and likely decision-making situation is one in which we ought to decide between implementing CEV or SCEV to a single ASI, but where the conditions for implementing SCEV instead of CEV are not fully optimal, where it is not the case that only one united decision-making entity is able to decide between the proposals, but rather, where there are already some decision makers that strongly prefer CEV instead of SCEV. In many of these kinds of decision-making situations, it may be much less desirable to try to implement a value learning proposal that adequately takes into account the interests of all sentient beings. Implementing SCEV may have even worse consequences in expectations for sentient non-humans due to a backlash from the opposition that may arise in trying to pursue this proposal. There is then, a strong reason against trying to implement SCEV due to the fact that, in practice, it might be net-negative in expectation.&nbsp;</p><p>However, it is not completely clear that this will be the case, and we might indeed find ourselves in future in which the pro-tanto reasons against trying to implement SCEV do not outweigh the pro-tanto reasons in favour of doing it. And, even if we can conceive of plausible future scenarios in which it seems to be the case that trying to pursue a proposal similar to CEV instead of SCEV would be preferable all things considered, to take that decision as a result of an adequate cost-benefit analysis of the different proposals it is crucial to understand the strong pro-tanto reasons in favour of SCEV that I have laid out in this paper.&nbsp;</p><h1>6. Conclusion<strong>&nbsp;</strong></h1><p>In this paper, I have shown why we have some very strong pro-tanto reasons in favour of implementing SCEV instead of CEV. This is the case even if, all things considered, it is still ultimately unclear whether what is best is to try to implement SCEV or another proposal more similar to CEV. The action-relevant implications of what I have laid out in this paper, however, are not all contingent on the realization of the future in which we can fully decide what ambitious value learning proposals to try to implement. Even if we could be sure such a future will not be realized, there would still be some practical implications that follow. Determining how much more morally desirable SCEV is than CEV due to the strong pro-tanto reasons presented in the paper, is crucial to adequately make tradeoffs between different considerations in non-ideal decision-making situations where a value learning proposal has to be implemented. Furthermore, it is likely that the mere fact of having in mind what a possibly ideal scenario of adequate value specification would look like is useful in determining what we should realistically strive for if we could only reach more modest goals. Research into how different alignment and value learning proposals for possible future transformative AIs such as an AGI or ASI could affect sentient non-humans (who constitute the immense majority of present and future sentient beings expected to exist) is highly neglected. More research along these lines is required if we want to ensure that the far future goes well for all sentient beings.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Acknowledgements:</strong>&nbsp;</h3><p>Acknowledgements: I am deeply grateful, for their suggestions, encouragement, and support to <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/olle-haeggstroem?mention=user\">@Olle H\u00e4ggstr\u00f6m</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/anthony-digiovanni?mention=user\">@Anthony DiGiovanni</a>, <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/magnusvinding?mention=user\">@Magnus Vinding</a>, Julia Pearson (<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/juliahp?mention=user\">@JuliaHP</a>), <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/lukas_gloor?mention=user\">@Lukas_Gloor</a>, Aluenda Diana Smeeton and an anonymous reviewer of the Journal of Artificial Intelligence and Consciousness.

The geopolitical and long-term economic implications of historically unprecedented immigration seem potentially important. E.g. China's population is already declining and fertility is very low.

This initiative is more than just an idea; it's a journey towards redefining what we consider as progress in our societies. It's a canvas awaiting our collective insights and actions to transform how we measure and understand societal health.</p><h2><strong>Navigating the Complexity of Modern Society with the WBI</strong></h2><p>The fundamental challenge in our current approach to measuring societal progress lies in the limitations of traditional metrics like GDP. These metrics often fail to capture the intricate complexities and nuances of modern life, and their focus on economic growth can obscure critical issues such as resource depletion, environmental impact, and social inequalities. As we move into an era marked by rapid advancements in AI and robotics, the disconnect between economic metrics and the multifaceted nature of societal well-being becomes increasingly apparent.</p><p>In response to this growing dissonance, and amidst an environment of fluctuating economic indicators like high interest rates and stagnating GDP growth, the Well-Being Index (WBI) emerges as a much-needed new compass, a \u2018North Star\u2019. The current absence of a unified global Key Performance Indicator (KPI) leads to misaligned efforts in addressing world challenges.</p><p>At the forefront of the WBI project is an ambition to shift from traditional metrics like Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to a more holistic, encompassing measure of societal health. <strong>Integrating real-time data on diverse aspects such as housing affordability, employment conditions, mental well-being, and environmental sustainability, the WBI aims to provide a multifaceted view of our collective prosperity, spanning local to global scales.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In a transformative shift from traditional economic competition, imagine a world where nations strive to outdo each other based on the Well-Being Index (WBI) rather than mere GDP growth. This paradigm shift would foster a collaborative form of competition, where the success of one nation in enhancing its societal well-being becomes a catalyst for others to follow. Countries would be incentivized to share best practices, learn from each other\u2019s successes and challenges, and even support each other\u2019s growth in well-being metrics. This is not just competition but cooperative progression, where the triumph of one country in achieving higher WBI scores propels others towards similar achievements. Such a global focus on the WBI rather than GDP would create an international environment where the pursuit of well-being becomes a collective endeavor, benefiting all nations and their citizens. It\u2019s a competition where every participant\u2019s growth contributes to a global rise in quality of life, environmental sustainability, and social equity \u2013 a true win-win scenario for the global community</p><p>In this era of technological innovation and environmental consciousness, the WBI stands as a beacon of a new paradigm. It offers a metric deeply attuned to the realities of our time \u2014 a metric that equally values human well-being, planetary health, and economic prosperity. This shift represents a move towards a more sustainable and equitable model of progress, where the advancement of society does not come at the expense of our natural world or the fabric of our communities but is harmoniously integrated with the overall health of our planet and its inhabitants.</p><h2><strong>Revolutionizing Societal Health Metrics with Live Data in the WBI</strong></h2><p>While traditional metrics like the Human Development Index (HDI), Gross National Happiness (GNH), Happy Planet Index (HPI), and Social Progress Index (SPI) have provided valuable insights, they face significant limitations in engagement and responsiveness due to their reliance on static data. This static nature often fails to capture the rapidly evolving social and economic landscape. Furthermore, critical data, especially in sensitive areas such as anonymized health information, is not readily available under current policy frameworks, limiting these indices' potential for real-time impact.</p><p><strong>The Well-Being Index (WBI) addresses these challenges by pioneering the use of live data, enabling real-time feedback on the social and economic pulse from the micro-level of municipalities and districts to the macro-level of cities, regions, and nations</strong>. This innovative approach transforms the WBI into an interactive and responsive measure of societal health, engaging individuals and communities not just as observers but as active participants in shaping the index. By ensuring access to dynamic, relevant data, while advocating for policy changes that allow ethical data utilization, the WBI is set to offer a more accurate, comprehensive, and live reflection of our communities, capturing the nuances of contemporary life. To serve as a new North Star in societal health metrics, guiding our decisions and policies with an unprecedented level of accuracy and responsiveness.</p><h2><strong>Gamification: Encouraging Individual and Collective Participation</strong></h2><p>The WBI introduces the concept of gamification into the realm of societal well-being. By creating a system where individuals and communities are motivated to improve their well-being scores, we embed an element of interaction and reward into the pursuit of societal health. This gamification aspect aims to foster a sense of community and collective responsibility, making the process of societal improvement both engaging and enjoyable.</p><p>Recognizing the unique position and potential of Gen-Z \u2013 digital natives who are interconnected, environmentally conscious, and invested in individual well-being -&nbsp; the WBI project seeks to leverage their perspectives and energy.</p><h2><strong>Empowering Local Communities for Wider Impact</strong></h2><p>The WBI is designed to not only measure but also to empower. By providing targeted support and insights into neighboring areas, we can create a ripple effect of improvement. The premise is simple yet impactful: enhancing the well-being of surrounding areas contributes to our collective prosperity. The WBI encourages looking beyond our immediate vicinity to foster regional and global well-being.</p><h2><strong>AI Alignment: Harmonizing Humanity and AI for Societal Well-being</strong></h2><p>In a world increasingly driven by the AI revolution, the quest for alignment between humans and artificial intelligence is a pressing and complex challenge. A thought-provoking perspective to consider is that the key to achieving this alignment may lie in first attaining harmony within humanity itself. By ensuring that the Well-Being Index (WBI) is finely tuned to human objectives and ethical principles, we aim to create a synergy where AI not only processes and analyzes data for efficiency but also embodies our collective aspirations for global well-being. This approach to integrating AI into the WBI seeks to mirror our shared values and goals, reflecting a concerted effort to align technological advancements with the nuanced tapestry of human society.</p><h2><strong>The WBI and Capitalism: Paving the Way for Economic Transformation</strong></h2><p>In the prevailing capitalist model, where GDP often serves as the primary benchmark for economic health and policy decisions, the introduction of the Well-Being Index (WBI) presents a revolutionary shift. By aligning WBI metrics with local taxation systems, we can recalibrate capitalist incentives to prioritize societal well-being alongside economic growth. For instance, regions demonstrating higher WBI scores could benefit from tax incentives or resource allocations, encouraging local governments and businesses to invest more in community well-being, environmental sustainability, and equitable growth. This approach not only harmonizes capitalist dynamics with broader societal goals but also lays the groundwork for a gradual transition towards a resource-based economy. In such an economy, the allocation and utilization of resources would be directly tied to enhancing overall societal well-being, as measured by the WBI, rather than merely maximizing financial output. This integration of the WBI into the fabric of our economic system could transform the very essence of capitalism, steering it towards a more holistic, equitable, and sustainable future.</p><h2><strong>Initial Roadmap for the WBI Development and Implementation</strong></h2><p><strong>1. Enhancing Engagement through Live Data:&nbsp;</strong>Develop a WBI platform that is interactive and engaging, utilizing live data to accurately reflect the real-time socio-economic conditions at various community levels.</p><p><strong>2</strong>.&nbsp;<strong>Developing a Comprehensive Regulatory Compliance Framework and Advocacy for Regulatory Reform:&nbsp;</strong>Undertake a detailed analysis of global and regional data protection regulations. Simultaneously, engage in advocacy efforts to promote regulatory reforms that facilitate easier access to essential data for public good, while upholding privacy and security standards.</p><p><strong>3. Implementing Gamification Strategies:&nbsp;</strong>Craft innovative gamification mechanisms to encourage individual and collective contributions towards societal well-being.</p><p><strong>4. Regional Upliftment Initiatives:&nbsp;</strong>Design frameworks for assisting and uplifting surrounding communities, contributing to collective prosperity.</p><p><strong>5. Creating Interactive Feedback Platforms:&nbsp;</strong>Establish channels for ongoing dialogue, feedback, and collaborative development to continuously refine the WBI.</p><h2><strong>MVP Stage for the WBI</strong></h2><p><strong>1. Comprehensive Analysis of Existing Indices:&nbsp;</strong>Conduct a detailed comparative analysis of well-being indicators such as the HDI, GNH, HPI, and SPI to inform the development of the WBI.</p><p><strong>2. Global Survey for Weight Allocation:&nbsp;</strong>Execute an international survey targeting diverse respondents to gather insights for assigning appropriate weights to the WBI\u2019s various factors.</p><p><strong>3. Regulatory Roadmap Development:&nbsp;</strong>Outline the necessary regulatory adjustments for data collection and usage, addressing privacy laws and ethical considerations.</p><p><strong>4. Educational Materials Creation:&nbsp;</strong>Develop and disseminate educational resources, including explainer videos, to communicate the purpose and importance of the WBI.</p><p><strong>5. Global Outreach Campaign:&nbsp;</strong>Engage over 1,000 policymakers worldwide to build consensus on the WBI\u2019s value and its potential to inform policy decisions.</p><h2><strong>Conclusion: Embarking on a Transformative Quest with the WBI</strong></h2><p>As we reflect on the state of our world, it's evident that global affairs are not on an optimistic trajectory, signaling a pressing need for change. Recognizing this, the WBI represents a profound shift in our approach to measuring societal progress, transcending traditional economic metrics to embrace a more comprehensive view of human and planetary health.</p><p>This journey, while sparked by individual inspiration, thrives on collective wisdom and collaboration. The WBI, in its essence, is a call to action for all who envision a future where societal advancement is in harmony with the well-being of our planet and its people. It is about creating a balanced, equitable, and thriving world, where progress is gauged by the richness of human and environmental health, not just economic growth.</p><p>As I navigate this path, I extend an open invitation to the Effective Altruism community and beyond. Your insights, expertise, and feedback are invaluable in this venture. Whether you contribute through critical analysis, innovative ideas, or practical solutions, your involvement will be instrumental in shaping the WBI into a tool that not only reflects our current challenges but also guides us towards a sustainable future.</p><p>Join me in this exciting endeavor. Share your perspectives, join the dialogue, and help transform this vision into a tangible reality.

The aim of this report was to explore the potential of extending current animal protection laws, conventions, and directives to adjacent areas, which might be more feasible than proposing entirely new laws. This research focused on identifying and evaluating laws in various geographic regions and prioritising ideas based on their potential impact.</p><p>The key findings of the report are as follows:</p><ul><li>The Shandong guidelines on chicken handling, transport, and slaughter, passed in 2016, could provide a highly promising area for extending legislation. Several extension ideas are proposed. These issues should be investigated in more depth by consulting with existing animal advocacy groups and experts in China to determine next steps.</li><li>The UK\u2019s Animal Welfare Act 2006 may also be a promising law to extend. Potential extensions to fishing and/or invertebrates should be investigated further.</li><li>The Ohio Administrative Code, Section 901:12, currently only bans caging practices in production. This ban could be extended to sales, thus also affecting state imports. This intervention idea should be passed on to existing animal advocacy groups in the U.S., which they may pursue or investigate further.</li><li>EU Regulation 1/2005 and Directive 98/58 could be extended to (farmed) fish. This intervention idea should be passed on to existing animal advocacy groups at the EU level, which they may pursue or investigate further.</li><li>Other laws yield less promising ideas for extension.</li></ul><p>Overall, these ideas have only been investigated in a relatively shallow manner. This report should act as inspiration for further work and research to determine the real merits of the proposed ideas.</p><h1>1 &nbsp; &nbsp; Aim</h1><p>The topic for this report is a scoping exercise, with the goal of looking at existing animal protection laws, conventions, directives, and other regulatory frameworks (called only \u2018laws\u2019 from here on) and see how they could be extended to adjacent areas. This was chosen as a research area because extending existing laws might be more tractable than proposing completely new ones.</p><p>The idea was to investigate relevant laws and geographic regions, find potential ideas in this context, and then prioritise those ideas in terms of their promisingness. The most promising ideas were selected to undergo a quick review, based on which recommendations for further research were made.</p><h1>2 &nbsp; &nbsp; Research process</h1><p>The basis for this report is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1muLwRLKWRldDj58AHW4YJGyxKXABJ0Zor8O_-HGE3zo/edit?usp=drive_link\"><u>this spreadsheet</u></a>, which I set up to structure my research. The most relevant, but not all, findings from the spreadsheet are included in this report. Additionally, the report includes findings that were not included in the spreadsheet. Interested readers may thus consult the spreadsheet for further information and details regarding the entire research process. However, this report acts as a standalone resource and is more relevant than the spreadsheet, summarising the most crucial and action-relevant information from my research. In this section, I describe the process I followed to set up the spreadsheet and arrive at the findings of this scoping exercise.&nbsp;</p><p>First, I tried to find the most relevant animal laws in this short period of time. In my search, I prioritised the United States (U.S.), the European Union (EU), a few major European countries, and some major low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) (China, Brazil, India, Indonesia), since these should be the countries where legislative changes would have the biggest impact (i.e., countries with the most animals killed (<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/animals-slaughtered-for-meat?tab=table\"><u>Our World in Data, n.d.</u></a>)) and/or should be most tractable. I came up with a list of 38 laws, most of which were from the U.S. and the EU.</p><p>Second, I brainstormed potential ideas for extending these laws to adjacent areas, for instance by strengthening regulations (e.g., space requirements or transport times), applying them to further animal groups or geographic regions, or covering other parts of the supply chain or market (e.g., applying rules to imports or extending production bans to sales). I excluded 15 laws that did not seem promising in this respect, as I did not see any ideas for extending those laws that would be highly promising. This left me with 23 laws for further investigation.</p><p>Third, I listed all the specific ideas that resulted from my brainstorming for these remaining laws - a set of 39 ideas (usually 1-2 ideas per law, in rare cases more). I scored these ideas on the dimensions of scale, tractability, and neglectedness and converted this into an overall score. I spent roughly 5-10 minutes per idea on this scoring, using some evidence, but generally only doing very quick intuitive reviews.</p><p>Fourth, I reviewed the list and scores in full to ensure that my ratings were consistent and reasonable, and tried different ways of computing the final score to perform sensitivity checks.</p><p>Finally, for the top nine ideas (scores of 30 or larger), I consulted my advisor and listed crucial considerations in order to ensure that I did not miss any important factors and to get a more holistic perspective on each intervention. Based on the scores and crucial considerations, we decided on to proceed with different the laws and ideas.</p><p>In the following section, I discuss the findings of this research regarding the most promising laws and ideas that emerged from this process. I list some initial pieces of evidence and crucial considerations for the extension of each of the laws, based on quick reviews. I then make recommendations on how to proceed further with these ideas, which can serve as starting points for further research.</p><p>The laws are covered in descending order of expected promisingness. I conducted more detailed research on the laws listed first, especially on the top priority, the chicken welfare guidelines in Shandong, China.&nbsp;</p><h1>3 &nbsp; &nbsp; Findings</h1><p>The following table provides an overview of the different laws covered in detail in this report and the investigated ideas on how to extend them.

There might be an opportunity to extend these guidelines beyond their current scope, which could have implications for animal welfare on a large scale. The standards for chickens could be made more comprehensive (e.g., introducing certain space requirements) or could be extended to other animals, to other regions of China, or to cover sales, not only production. As this is the most promising topic that emerged from this scoping exercise, I investigate it in more detail here than the other laws following afterwards. I first outline the current state of animal protection legislation in China (<u>section 3.1.1</u>) and the general potential for improving it (<u>3.1.2</u>), then describe the Shandong guidelines in detail (<u>3.1.3</u>) and list ideas for extending them (<u>3.1.4</u>), and finally summarise my findings and make recommendations for further research (<u>3.1.5</u>).</p><p>It is important to note that my shallow research on this topic is severely limited by language barriers. I primarily relied on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.worldanimalprotection.org/\"><u>World Animal Protection</u></a>\u2019s description and interpretation of Chinese legislation, trying to add links to the relevant laws in either English or Chinese, depending on what I found online. In general, I relied only on English-language sources. Some of the information may thus be inaccurate. For further research, Chinese language skills or translations of original sources would be helpful.</p><h3><strong>3.1.1 Animal protection legislation in China</strong></h3><p>Understanding the situation for farmed animals in China, particularly regarding legislative protection, is essential before delving into the specific topic of Shandong.</p><p>China farms animals on a very large scale. It leads the world in the number of animals slaughtered for meat per year and is by far the largest egg, fish, and seafood producer globally (<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/meat-production\"><u>Ritchie et al., 2019</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/fish-and-overfishing\"><u>Ritchie &amp; Roser, 2021</u></a>). At the same time, animal welfare standards and legal protection are low (<a href=\"https://api.worldanimalprotection.org/country/china\"><u>World Animal Protection, 2020a</u></a>). In an interview with Forbes (<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltobias/2012/11/02/animal-rights-in-china/\"><u>Tobias, 2012</u></a>), Peter Li from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hsi.org/\"><u>Humane Society International</u></a> summarised the dire situation for animals:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cAnimal suffering is unprecedented in China in magnitude in both numerical terms (having the largest number of nonhuman animals in farming units) and in welfare conditions. With regard to China\u2019s ranking on a global report card, so to speak, I would not hesitate to say that it may be at the bottom, if not the very bottom. Why do I say so? Look at the facts: Mainland China does not have a comprehensive animal protection law. Animal cruelty is not a punishable offense. China has the world\u2019s largest number of animals in the industrialized farms. China\u2019s continuing development model gives priority to productivity increase defined in terms of material gains. China\u2019s pro-business politics has made societal voices for animal protection a nuisance to policy-makers and the business communities alike. The overall political environment is against activism for animal protection, certainly in the foreseeable future.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>While China has certain regulations and standards when it comes to the farming of animals, most of these are weak and/or focused on food safety and public health concerns instead of animal welfare. This is evident in all areas of animal farming, from rearing to transport and slaughter.</p><p>When it comes to the rearing of animals, the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.npc.gov.cn/zgrdw/englishnpc/Law/2007-12/13/content_1384134.htm\"><u>Animal Husbandry Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China</u></a> is the most important legislation. However, its focus is primarily on the protection of genetic resources rather than on animal welfare. In addition, the Chinese Veterinary Medical Association, guided by the Ministry of Agriculture, has undertaken the development of General Principles of Animal Welfare. These principles serve as non-binding guidelines that encompass a range of animal categories, including farmed animals. They touch upon critical aspects, such as infrastructure, feeding environments, and health. However, these guidelines are not mandatory and specific legislation dedicated to the rearing of individual animal species remains absent, signifying a critical gap in animal welfare regulations. (<a href=\"https://api.worldanimalprotection.org/country/china\"><u>World Animal Protection, 2020a</u></a>)</p><p>Regarding transport, Article 53 of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.npc.gov.cn/zgrdw/englishnpc/Law/2007-12/13/content_1384134.htm\"><u>Animal Husbandry Law of the People\u2019s Republic of China</u></a> stipulates that the transportation of animals must adhere to relevant by-laws and regulations, ensuring the safety and essential needs of livestock during transit. This legal provision emphasises the importance of providing adequate space, food, and water during transportation. Furthermore, the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.chinajusticeobserver.com/law/x/law-on-animal-epidemic-prevention-of-china-20210122\"><u>Animal Epidemic Prevention Law of the People's Republic of China</u></a> and its associated documents encourage avoiding long-distance transportation of livestock, recognizing the potential for stress and harm during extended journeys. In sum, legislation focusing on the transport of animals appears relatively progressive when compared to other sections of the legislation dedicated to rearing conditions. (<a href=\"https://api.worldanimalprotection.org/country/china\"><u>World Animal Protection, 2020a</u></a>)</p><p>With respect to the slaughter of animals, the Ministry of Agriculture has issued supplementary documents with the intention of promoting humane slaughter practices, especially the practice of stunning before slaughter. However, it is important to emphasise that the use of stunning remains optional and not mandatory. (<a href=\"https://api.worldanimalprotection.org/country/china\"><u>World Animal Protection, 2020a</u></a>) Specific standards are in place for pig slaughter though, requiring humane slaughter (<a href=\"https://api.worldanimalprotection.org/country/china\"><u>World Animal Protection, 2020a</u></a>). Regulations such as Articles 8, 11, and 15 of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://leap.unep.org/en/countries/cn/national-legislation/regulations-administration-slaughtering-pigs\"><u>Regulations on Administration of Hog Slaughter</u></a> and Article 13 of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://leap.unep.org/en/countries/cn/national-legislation/provisions-implementation-management-regulations-live-pig\"><u>Implementation Methods of Pig Slaughtering Management Regulation</u></a> address various aspects of slaughter conditions and procedures for pigs. This includes the prohibition of injecting pigs with water to increase their weight prior to slaughter and a requirement for inspections of pig slaughterhouses pre-and post-mortem. Despite these regulations, there is a notable lack of clear enforcement mechanisms, leaving room for improvement in ensuring the humane treatment of animals during the slaughter process. (<a href=\"https://api.worldanimalprotection.org/country/china\"><u>World Animal Protection, 2020a</u></a>)</p><p>In addition, the Ministry of Agriculture has introduced regulations pertaining to veterinary medicine and daily veterinary practices. One significant measure includes the establishment of a veterinary medicine list, which restricts the use of medicines not included in the list, thus preventing the potential for drug abuse within the industry. (<a href=\"https://api.worldanimalprotection.org/country/china\"><u>World Animal Protection, 2020a</u></a>)</p><p>In sum, China\u2019s legislative protection for farmed animals is weak. Pig slaughter and transport are the only aspects that somewhat stand out from this overall picture.</p><h3><strong>3.1.2 Possibility of legislative improvements in China</strong></h3><p>Enhancing the legal protection of animals in China, given its relatively rigid and closed political system, appears to be a challenging task. However, \u201cgovernment is the most effective means of change\u201d (<a href=\"https://chinadialogue.net/en/nature/5740-younger-generation-face-long-wait-for-law-change-on-animal-cruelty/\"><u>Levitt, 2013</u></a>) in China and extending the Shandong guidelines on chicken slaughter would require policy lobbying. It is thus worth investigating the tractability of legislative improvements for animals in China. In this section, I will outline crucial considerations around this general issue, before turning to the Shandong guidelines in the&nbsp;<u>next section</u>.</p><p><i><strong>Primacy of food security, economic development, and public health</strong></i></p><p>In China, ensuring food security and maintaining social stability through low prices often takes precedence over animal welfare considerations and has done so for decades (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20231106224903/https://www.economist.com/china/2023/08/31/china-has-embraced-pets-but-animal-welfare-is-still-a-problem\"><u>The Economist, 2023</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltobias/2012/11/02/animal-rights-in-china/\"><u>Tobias, 2012</u></a>). This priority also seems to be deeply rooted in Chinese culture. For instance, in contrast to the Western \u2018how are you\u2019, the traditional Chinese greeting is \u2018have you eaten\u2019, and Peter Li from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hsi.org/\"><u>Humane Society International</u></a> argues that pork is as important to Chinese consumers as gasoline is to Americans (<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltobias/2012/11/02/animal-rights-in-china/\"><u>Tobias, 2012</u></a>). The primacy of food security and public health is also evidenced by the heavy emphasis placed on these issues by China\u2019s strong animal welfare science literature (<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/10/3/540\"><u>Sinclair et al., 2020</u></a>). This historical and continuing prioritisation of economic development and food security over social and environmental concerns, including animal welfare, has created a significant hurdle to enacting comprehensive animal protection legislation (<a href=\"https://chinadialogue.net/en/nature/5740-younger-generation-face-long-wait-for-law-change-on-animal-cruelty/\"><u>Levitt, 2013</u></a>).</p><p>However, an emphasis on non-animal-specific factors is not always detrimental to progress on animal welfare reforms. Food safety and public health are important concerns in China that can benefit from enhanced animal welfare standards. A wide variety of sources show that Chinese consumers have a preference for higher-welfare products, benefiting food security, public health, and individual health (<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/11/3/855\"><u>Carnovale et al., 2021</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1049530/full\"><u>Jiang et al., 2023</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://chinadialogue.net/en/nature/5740-younger-generation-face-long-wait-for-law-change-on-animal-cruelty/\"><u>Levitt, 2013</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20231106224903/https://www.economist.com/china/2023/08/31/china-has-embraced-pets-but-animal-welfare-is-still-a-problem\"><u>The Economist, 2023</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.worldanimalprotection.org/news/chinese-consumers-support-better-welfare-pigs\"><u>World Animal Protection, 2016</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4196765/\"><u>You et al., 2014</u></a>). These factors seem more important than animal welfare concerns, when it comes to people\u2019s consumption choices. In that sense, it seems fair to conclude&nbsp; \u201cthat the majority of the public in China take a stand of weak anthropocentrism\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4196765/\"><u>You et al., 2014</u></a>) and that \u201canimal welfare is of importance to the Chinese consumer, in particular because of its connection to food quality\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/11/3/855\"><u>Carnovale et al., 2021</u></a>).</p><p>Overall, aspects that affect human wellbeing, like food security, public health, and economic development clearly dominate concerns among the Chinese public and legislators over specific animal welfare concerns. There is some potential for activists to leverage these issues though, as they can highlight that a lot of the issues that the public cares about are strongly negatively impacted by factory farming.</p><p><i><strong>Low but growing concern for animal welfare</strong></i></p><p>However, concern for animal welfare specifically for the sake of animals\u2019 wellbeing seems very low in China. As The Economist (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20231106224903/https://www.economist.com/china/2023/08/31/china-has-embraced-pets-but-animal-welfare-is-still-a-problem\"><u>2023</u></a>) writes, when it comes to farmed animals,</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cChina\u2019s grim welfare standards are often as cruel as those of much poorer countries, where the idea that animals have feelings or rights is an unthinkable luxury. Opinion polls and consumer-spending habits indicate that one driver of continued poor treatment on farms and in slaughterhouses is widespread public indifference to such cruelty, including among besotted pet owners\u201d.</i></p></blockquote><p>Different studies (<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/11/3/855\"><u>Carnovale et al., 2021</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4196765/\"><u>You et al., 2014</u></a>) have shown that animal welfare is not a familiar concept to most people in China and \u201canimal welfare as a societal concern is still at an early stage of development\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/11/3/855\"><u>Carnovale et al., 2021</u></a>). There is evidence that Chinese consumers show less compassion for the animals they eat than those in countries like Brazil, India, Russia, and the U.S. (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20231106224903/https://www.economist.com/china/2023/08/31/china-has-embraced-pets-but-animal-welfare-is-still-a-problem\"><u>The Economist, 2023</u></a>). This indifference or insensitivity to animal suffering may be attributed to socialisation under Mao\u2019s leadership (<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltobias/2012/11/02/animal-rights-in-china/\"><u>Tobias, 2012</u></a>).</p><p>There are strong signs that public perception is changing though, especially among the younger generations and urban populations (<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/11/3/855\"><u>Carnovale et al., 2021</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://chinadialogue.net/en/nature/5740-younger-generation-face-long-wait-for-law-change-on-animal-cruelty/\"><u>Levitt, 2013</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20140728100740/http://news.msn.com/world/animal-welfare-activists-in-china-rise-up-against-cruelty\"><u>McGuinness, 2013</u></a>). According to Peter Li (<a href=\"https://chinadialogue.net/en/nature/5740-younger-generation-face-long-wait-for-law-change-on-animal-cruelty/\"><u>Levitt, 2013</u></a>), young Chinese are exposed to new ideas like animal welfare, which were unknown or unimportant to their parents. Young people\u2019s better economic situation allows them to care less about food security and more about ethical issues and non-material goods, making them more sensitive to cruelty and more charitable donors (<a href=\"https://chinadialogue.net/en/nature/5740-younger-generation-face-long-wait-for-law-change-on-animal-cruelty/\"><u>Levitt, 2013</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltobias/2012/11/02/animal-rights-in-china/\"><u>Tobias, 2012</u></a>).</p><p>Economic progress generally brings about more demand for higher-welfare products. China's burgeoning middle class is increasingly willing to invest in higher-quality and organic food products (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20231106224903/https://www.economist.com/china/2023/08/31/china-has-embraced-pets-but-animal-welfare-is-still-a-problem\"><u>The Economist, 2023</u></a>).

(<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4196765/\"><u>2014</u></a>) all report that a majority of consumers are willing to pay more for food produced under better animal welfare conditions. \u201cChina is also changing the way it thinks about dog meat, animal testing, and the ivory trade\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Points-of-Progress/2017/0706/Millions-of-pigs-will-soon-live-better-lives-in-China\"><u>Hinckley, 2017</u></a>). Such shifts in consumer attitudes towards animal welfare also have an impact on economic incentives for producers. \u201cSome analysts believe that there is an untapped market for food that can be shown to come from well-treated livestock\u201d (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20231106224903/https://www.economist.com/china/2023/08/31/china-has-embraced-pets-but-animal-welfare-is-still-a-problem\"><u>The Economist, 2023</u></a>).</p><p>Accordingly, World Animal Protection (<a href=\"https://www.worldanimalprotection.org/news/chinese-consumers-support-better-welfare-pigs\"><u>2016</u></a>) found strong indicators for consumers looking for higher welfare products. They quote their own campaign manager in China, Chu Xueqin, saying: \u201cThere is a growing awareness among Chinese people about the importance of animal welfare, and a growing demand for the food we eat to come from farm animals with a better quality of life\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.worldanimalprotection.org/news/chinese-consumers-support-better-welfare-pigs\"><u>World Animal Protection, 2016</u></a>). Similarly, Jiang et al. (<a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1049530/full\"><u>2023</u></a>) find that \u201cthe Chinese public not only considers farm animals to be emotional and sentient but are also sympathetic toward farm animals that suffer inhumane treatment.\u201d You et al. (<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4196765/\"><u>2014</u></a>) find that a majority of respondents agreed that rearing conditions for pigs and domestic fowls should be improved and that laws to improve animal welfare should be established. However, these concerns for animal welfare seem likely to be primarily driven by food security and (public) health concerns and are not necessarily indicative of people\u2019s care for the animals themselves, as described&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18AcQ5D3tzVNrHb3BrQH6i9PJx0oJ_BV5Hl_53ZL0Jzc/edit#heading=h.2hjohcqx6d0h\"><u>above</u></a> (<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/11/3/855\"><u>Carnovale et al., 2021</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1049530/full\"><u>Jiang et al., 2023</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://chinadialogue.net/en/nature/5740-younger-generation-face-long-wait-for-law-change-on-animal-cruelty/\"><u>Levitt, 2013</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4196765/\"><u>You et al., 2014</u></a>).</p><p>Looking at concern for animal welfare specifically, Carnovale et al. (<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-2615/11/3/855\"><u>2021</u></a>) found that awareness of animal welfare was higher in their study compared to previously reported numbers. In general, attention to animal suffering seems to be at an all-time high in contemporary China (<a href=\"https://chinadialogue.net/en/nature/5740-younger-generation-face-long-wait-for-law-change-on-animal-cruelty/\"><u>Levitt, 2013</u></a>). The following passage from Levitt\u2019s (<a href=\"https://chinadialogue.net/en/nature/5740-younger-generation-face-long-wait-for-law-change-on-animal-cruelty/\"><u>2013</u></a>) interview with Peter Li nicely illustrates the significance of the ongoing cultural shifts:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cMedia attention on animal suffering is a radical revolution. In China\u2019s pre-reform era, animal suffering or animal protection issues were never a report subject. Love of animals was condemned as bourgeoisie. Compassion for animals was considered counter-revolutionary. Pet ownership was believed to be the luxury of the exploiting class, having nothing to do with the life of the working people. Young people who have no recollection of the past and not influenced by the extremist ideological bias against pet ownership, are more likely to find cruelty to animals unacceptable.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>These changes in public perception have the potential to exert strong pressure for legislative change. While concern for animal welfare is at a very low base level in China, the rapid economic development of the country has brought about and will likely continue to bring about stronger demand for higher animal welfare.</p><p><i><strong>Animal activism</strong></i></p><p>Accordingly, animal activism is also growing in China. According to Jill Robinson from Animals Asia Foundation, the number of animal welfare organisations in China has grown from only one in the 1980s to hundreds in 2017 (<a href=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Points-of-Progress/2017/0706/Millions-of-pigs-will-soon-live-better-lives-in-China\"><u>Hinckley, 2017</u></a>).</p><p>Groups like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.animalsasia.org/\"><u>Animals Asia Foundation</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.spca.org.hk\"><u>Hong Kong SPCA</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hsi.org/\"><u>Humane Society International</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ifaw.org/\"><u>International Fund for Animal Welfare</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.rspca.org.uk/\"><u>RSPCA</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.worldanimalprotection.org/\"><u>World Animal Protection</u></a> have secured important successes for animal welfare by collaborating with Chinese authorities (<a href=\"https://chinadialogue.net/en/nature/5740-younger-generation-face-long-wait-for-law-change-on-animal-cruelty/\"><u>Levitt, 2013</u></a>). In an interview with Forbes (<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltobias/2012/11/02/animal-rights-in-china/\"><u>Tobias, 2012</u></a>), Peter Li also emphasises that animal advocates are among the most active lobbying groups in China, having been quite successful and growing their influence over time.</p><p>However, the Chinese government seems to overall pay relatively little attention to animal advocates in comparison to other interest groups, as they are no \u201cimmediate threat to social or political stability\u201d (<a href=\"https://chinadialogue.net/en/nature/5740-younger-generation-face-long-wait-for-law-change-on-animal-cruelty/\"><u>Levitt, 2013)</u></a>. Different sources mentioned a need for more work on educating the public and changing perceptions around animal welfare (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20231106224903/https://www.economist.com/china/2023/08/31/china-has-embraced-pets-but-animal-welfare-is-still-a-problem\"><u>The Economist, 2023</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4196765/\"><u>You et al., 2014</u></a>).</p><p><i><strong>Western influences on Chinese culture</strong></i></p><p>One watchout in this context is that the concept of animal welfare is sometimes seen as a Western import and as incompatible with Chinese culture (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20231106224903/https://www.economist.com/china/2023/08/31/china-has-embraced-pets-but-animal-welfare-is-still-a-problem\"><u>The Economist, 2023</u></a>). This viewpoint has led to resistance against adopting comprehensive animal protection legislation in China (<a href=\"https://chinadialogue.net/en/nature/5740-younger-generation-face-long-wait-for-law-change-on-animal-cruelty/\"><u>Levitt, 2013</u></a>). However, it seems similarly reasonable to argue that factory farming is itself a Western import (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20231106224903/https://www.economist.com/china/2023/08/31/china-has-embraced-pets-but-animal-welfare-is-still-a-problem\"><u>The Economist, 2023</u></a>), whose practices (like gestation crates, battery cages, or tail docking) were enthusiastically adopted in Chinese farms over the last decades (<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltobias/2012/11/02/animal-rights-in-china/\"><u>Tobias, 2012</u></a>). China has strong traditions that emphasise compassion for animals, like Daoism and Buddhism, even though interpretations of these cultural traditions likely vary widely. In addition, concern for animals is higher in Taiwan, a country with strong cultural and historical ties to China (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20231106224903/https://www.economist.com/china/2023/08/31/china-has-embraced-pets-but-animal-welfare-is-still-a-problem\"><u>The Economist, 2023</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaeltobias/2012/11/02/animal-rights-in-china/\"><u>Tobias, 2012</u></a>). So while there is some resistance to the import of animal welfare ideals from the West, there are good arguments against this view that can be leveraged by animal activists.</p><p><i><strong>Positive momentum and next steps</strong></i></p><p>My research revealed a promising sign that Chinese politicians might indeed be open to such arguments, creating a favourable political climate for animal activists.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cYu Kangzhen, the Associate Minister of Agriculture, delivered a keynote speech on World Conference on Farm Animal Welfare in 2017.&nbsp; He acknowledged animal sentience and linked it to Chinese traditional culture. Yu Kangzhen stated that promoting animal welfare is an essential outcome of economic and social development, which contributes to green agriculture development, food safety and human caring embodiment. He also called on all the stakeholders in the Chinese animal husbandry industry to promote animal welfare, with an overarching plan fitting within the process of China\u2019s economic and social development.\u201d</i> (<a href=\"https://api.worldanimalprotection.org/country/china\"><u>World Animal Protection, 2020a</u></a>)</p></blockquote><p>Further positive momentum comes from the fact that China has already made relevant improvements to its animal welfare legislation over the past decade.</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cIn 2014 China repealed a longstanding law requiring animal testing for some cosmetics, and also implemented a law that makes eating endangered animals punishable by up to 10 years in jail. And while international ivory trade has been illegal since the early 1990s, China and the United States have continued to permit domestic sales, which animal activists say directly contributes to declining elephant populations. But in 2015, Chinese President Xi Jinping agreed to crack down on domestic sales, and in March, China closed 67 licensed ivory factories. The remaining 130 factories are expected to close by the end of the year.\u201d</i> (<a href=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Points-of-Progress/2017/0706/Millions-of-pigs-will-soon-live-better-lives-in-China\"><u>Hinckley, 2017</u></a>)</p></blockquote><p>Looking ahead, World Animal Protection (<a href=\"https://api.worldanimalprotection.org/country/china\"><u>2020a</u></a>) provides a cautiously optimistic outlook, emphasising many possibilities for legislative improvements. For instance, they see promise in the development of the General Principles of Animal Welfare for enhancing animal welfare practices in China. While these principles are not legally binding, they have the potential to raise awareness and concern for farm animal welfare across the livestock industry. Moreover, they can serve as practical guidance for incorporating animal welfare considerations into future legislation, thereby improving the implementation and enforcement of relevant laws. Additionally, the introduction of species-specific legislation dedicated to animal welfare within farm animal production systems is a crucial step, considering the non-binding nature of the General Principles. This legislative move would represent a significant stride towards improving the overall welfare of animals in China. Moreover, China's membership in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.woah.org/en/home/\"><u>World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE)</u></a> presents an opportunity for the nation to align with international standards. As China's current legislative landscape does not fully encompass all of the OIE's standards, ongoing efforts are essential to bridge this gap and bring Chinese legislation in line with international benchmarks. (<a href=\"https://api.worldanimalprotection.org/country/china\"><u>World Animal Protection, 2020a</u></a>)</p><p>Some positive developments outside of national/federal legislation are notable here as well. One of China\u2019s largest agricultural producers voluntarily agreed to implement higher welfare standards for its pigs, like comfortable flooring and more space (<a href=\"https://www.csmonitor.com/World/Points-of-Progress/2017/0706/Millions-of-pigs-will-soon-live-better-lives-in-China\"><u>Hinckley, 2017</u></a>). The New York Times (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/world/asia/china-shandong-chicken-slaughter.html\"><u>Huang, 2016</u></a>) reports that \u201cmajor slaughterhouses in Beijing [...] already stun chickens by dipping their heads into electrified water\u201d. They also state that Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan province, \u201crequires slaughterhouses to allow pigs to rest at least 12 hours after being transported to the slaughterhouse before they are killed\u201d and has penalties in place for violations of these rules. Henan was generally a first mover in terms of pig welfare requirements. Already in 2007, a pilot project in the province required pigs to be electrically stunned before slaughter and \u201cthat live pigs be spared from watching the slaughter of other pigs\u201d (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221125130349/http://en.people.cn/n3/2016/0829/c90000-9106929.html\"><u>People\u2019s Daily Online, 2016</u></a>).</p><p><i><strong>Summary</strong></i></p><p>Overall, there is significant evidence that the current economic, political, and societal climate in China could be ripe for animal welfare legislation improvements. While I tried to keep my search for evidence as neutral as possible, my selection of sources is likely biassed towards positive views on this issue and I did not have time to more specifically check for negative examples (which future research could do). Still, this review updated me towards a more positive view on the tractability of legislative changes in China. These findings shape my perspective on the feasibility of expanding the Shandong guidelines, a topic I will explore in the following sections.</p><h3><strong>3.1.3 Scope and motivation of the Shandong guidelines</strong></h3><p>The province of Shandong decided to implement stricter guidelines on the welfare of chickens raised for meat production in 2016. These guidelines include specific requirements on different parts of the farming process. Regarding transport, they discourage the transport of chickens for more than three hours and prohibit the dragging of chickens by one of their wings or legs (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/world/asia/china-shandong-chicken-slaughter.html\"><u>Huang, 2016</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221125130349/http://en.people.cn/n3/2016/0829/c90000-9106929.html\"><u>People\u2019s Daily Online, 2016</u></a>). When it comes to slaughter, the standards mandate stunning by gas or electricity and recommend the use of soothing pads to calm animals down before slaughter (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/world/asia/china-shandong-chicken-slaughter.html\"><u>Huang, 2016</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221125130349/http://en.people.cn/n3/2016/0829/c90000-9106929.html\"><u>People\u2019s Daily Online, 2016</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://api.worldanimalprotection.org/country/china\"><u>World Animal Protection, 2020a</u></a>). \u201cSlaughterhouses must [also] avoid frightening or upsetting the poultry before they are dispatched for slaughter\u201d (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221125130349/http://en.people.cn/n3/2016/0829/c90000-9106929.html\"><u>People\u2019s Daily Online, 2016</u></a>). Further requirements are defined with respect to the handling and living conditions of the animals (<a href=\"https://api.worldanimalprotection.org/country/china\"><u>World Animal Protection, 2020a</u></a>).</p><p>These guidelines should present a major step forward for farmed chickens in Shandong, as World Animal Protection (<a href=\"https://api.worldanimalprotection.org/country/china\"><u>2020a</u></a>) states that \u201chumane slaughter is now legally required\u201d for poultry in Shandong. However, I found conflicting evidence to this statement, as both The New York Times (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/world/asia/china-shandong-chicken-slaughter.html\"><u>Huang, 2016</u></a>) and Sixth Tone (<a href=\"https://www.sixthtone.com/news/1272\"><u>Li, 2016</u></a>) write that the guidelines are not binding or mandatory. In contrast, Eurogroup for Animals (<a href=\"https://www.eurogroupforanimals.org/files/eurogroupforanimals/2023-01/2023_EfA_Analysis%20of%20AW%20standards%20for%20animal%20products%20imported%20to%20the%20EU_0.pdf\"><u>2023</u></a>) writes that humane slaughter is mandated by law for poultry in Shandong. Frustratingly, my further research on this was somewhat inconclusive, with language barriers preventing me from accessing primary sources. As mentioned before, accessing and understanding primary Chinese-language sources should thus be a priority for further research. Based on my interpretation of the evidence, it seems that humane&nbsp;<i>slaughter&nbsp;</i>might be obligatory, while the other standards mentioned above (for transport, handling, and living conditions) are only recommendations. The fact that humane slaughter for animals is mandatory is also suggested by the phrasing used by Xinhua (<a href=\"http://www.xinhuanet.com//english/2016-08/29/c_135643120.htm\"><u>2016</u></a>), stating that \u201clocal rule on the humane slaughter of chicken took effect in east China's Shandong Province\u201d. However, I remain uncertain about this and this is a crucial uncertainty that needs to be clarified in future research.</p><p>Assuming that at least humane slaughter is mandated in Shandong, this would affect a very large number of chickens. According to People\u2019s Daily Online (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221125130349/http://en.people.cn/n3/2016/0829/c90000-9106929.html\"><u>2016</u></a>), \u201cShandong is the biggest chicken breeding provincial region in China, providing some 20 percent of the country's chickens\u201d. Given that China killed roughly 11 billion chickens for meat in 2021 (<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/animals-slaughtered-for-meat?tab=table\"><u>Our World in Data, n.d.</u></a>), the regulation could affect more than 2 billion chicken killings annually. Shandong is generally one of the biggest producers of animal products among China\u2019s provinces and has a clear strategy to be a leader in modern animal agriculture (e.g. by implementing quality-standard centres and promoting standardisation). \"By 2025, 15 million tons of meat, eggs, and milk are expected to be produced in the province, the proportion of large-scale farming is expected to reach 88 percent\u201d (<a href=\"http://shandong.chinadaily.com.cn/2021-01/12/c_581792.htm\"><u>China Daily, 2021</u></a>).</p><p>This also relates to the reasons why the stricter animal welfare requirements were passed. According to People\u2019s Daily Online (<a href=\"http://web.archive.org/web/20221125130349/http://en.people.cn/n3/2016/0829/c90000-9106929.html\"><u>2016</u></a>) and The New York Times (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/world/asia/china-shandong-chicken-slaughter.html\"><u>Huang, 2016</u></a>), the guidelines were \u201cmotivated at least as much by commercial considerations as by concerns for animal welfare\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/world/asia/china-shandong-chicken-slaughter.html\"><u>Huang, 2016</u></a>), since low meat quality has impeded exports to more welfare-conscious markets like Europe as well as sales in high-end market segments within China. In comparison to its total broiler meat production volume, exports from China are relatively low (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/world/asia/china-shandong-chicken-slaughter.html\"><u>Huang, 2016</u></a>). So even though animal welfare is a somewhat rising concern in China, the guidelines seem to be primarily aimed at improving commercial competitiveness of Shandong producers, a perspective that is in line with the evidence cited in&nbsp;<u>section 3.1.2</u>.</p><h3><strong>3.1.4 Intervention ideas</strong></h3><p>Given the significance of these developments in Shandong, animal advocates should consider ways in which the new guidelines could be leveraged to achieve even larger animal welfare improvements. As written at the beginning of&nbsp;<u>section 3.1</u>, the standards for chickens could be made more comprehensive (e.g. introducing certain space requirements) or could be extended to other animals, to other regions of China, or to also cover sales, not only production. These intervention ideas are quickly reviewed below.</p><p>There is one kind of intervention idea that I did not include here, due to the significant uncertainties I still have around this issue. As described in the previous section, I am unsure whether the Shandong guidelines are mandatory at all, or which parts of them are mandatory. My current most likely interpretation is that humane slaughter is mandated, while other parts of the standards are only recommendations. If this is true, it could be worth investigating whether the other parts of the standards can also be made mandatory. If all of the guidelines (including those pertaining to slaughter) are found to be voluntary, we should probably first investigate whether there is the potential to make (parts of) the standards mandatory, before considering other ideas for extending the law. These uncertainties need to be kept in mind for my analysis of the different intervention options below. The perspective on them could significantly change, if my assumption above is wrong, and I suggest further research to resolve this uncertainty.</p><p><i><strong>Including further welfare standards</strong></i></p><p>Maybe the most promising idea for extending the Shandong guidelines is to broaden the scope of the regulations, including further requirements for chicken welfare like banning cages, defining more minimum space per animal, or prohibiting mutilations like beak trimming.</p><p>The scale of such additional welfare improvements for broiler chickens could be very large, given the massive numbers of animals farmed in the province. However, given that parts of the standards are likely not mandatory, the exact requirements to ask for need to be carefully considered, in order to make sure that they indeed have an impact on farming methods.</p><p>Such an extension might be tractable, given that there is already some momentum around introducing welfare standards that go beyond those of other Chinese provinces. Policy work at the province level might also be more tractable than at the national level. Overall, policy advocacy in China seems to be very difficult. However,&nbsp;<u>section 3.1.2</u> found grounds for optimism on the potential for legislative changes for animals in China.</p><p>Given the significance of the Shandong guidelines\u2019 introduction, animal advocacy groups should be aware of the issue and might already be working towards extensions of this law. As the Chinese representative of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ciwf.org.uk/\"><u>Compassion in World Farming</u></a> praised the Shandong standards, we know for sure that at least this organisation is aware of and potentially working on the issue (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/world/asia/china-shandong-chicken-slaughter.html\"><u>Huang, 2016</u></a>). Other organisations in the country are very likely to be aware of it as well. The issue might still be quite neglected, as this is a very specific intervention idea in one region of a generally relatively neglected country. Even if some organisations are already working on this, the idea might benefit from more attention and funding.</p><p><i><strong>Extending the standards to other animals</strong></i></p><p>Another idea is to extend the Shandong guidelines to other animals, apart from chickens.</p><p>The scale of the issue depends heavily on which animals would end up being covered by such stricter welfare standards. If fish were to be included, the scale would be very large, as Shandong does seem to have a significant aquaculture industry (<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-023-25601-9\"><u>Chen &amp; Gao, 2023</u></a>) and might have a strong fishing industry as well, due its coastal location. For other animals like cows or pigs, the scale would be modest, as Shandong seems to be a large producer of other animal products as well (<a href=\"http://shandong.chinadaily.com.cn/2021-01/12/c_581792.htm\"><u>China Daily, 2021</u></a>), but these animals are generally farmed in lower numbers. It seems more likely to me that this extension would affect the latter group of animals, as they are typically better protected by laws, so the scale of this idea seems smaller than that of the first idea above.</p><p>The considerations around tractability and neglectedness are very similar here as for previous idea.</p><p><i><strong>Extending the standards to other provinces or all of China</strong></i></p><p>It might also be worthwhile to advocate for an extension of the Shandong guidelines to other provinces or the whole of China.</p><p>The scale of such changes could be enormous, given that China kills the largest number of chickens worldwide (<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/animals-slaughtered-for-meat?tab=table\"><u>Our World in Data, n.d.</u></a>).</p><p>The considerations around tractability and neglectedness are similar here as for the first two ideas above. Work on the national level might be less neglected than work on the province level though. The issue might also be less tractable, given that this is a massive ask, especially when thinking about national legislative changes. Work in other provinces might be more tractable, but lower in scale. Some positive evidence on the tractability of such extensions comes from the case of the Henan province. From my reading of the sources, Henan introduced stricter pig welfare requirements in 2007 and national regulations were introduced one year later, in 2008. While any causal effects between these developments are highly uncertain, this provides at least some positive evidence that certain provinces can be first movers whose stricter standards are later adopted (to a certain extent) on a national scale.</p><p><i><strong>Extending the standards to cover imports from other provinces</strong></i></p><p>One final idea is that the current guidelines could be made to cover sales, not only production. The idea here is that stunning would not only be required for chicken meat produced in Shandong, but all chicken meat sold there, which might have been produced in other provinces.</p><p>The scale of this seems modest, given that I assume most of the chicken meat sold in Shandong to be produced there as well due to Shandong\u2019s high production levels.</p><p>The considerations around tractability and neglectedness are once again similar here as for the first two ideas above. The idea might seem like a natural extension of the existing law and could therefore be tractable. However, this idea generally seems more like a long shot, given that the motives for passing the current guidelines seems to lie in modernising production and not satisfying consumer demand for more ethical products. Importantly, it might also be legally impossible to prevent/penalise imports from other provinces, as was contested in the case of Prop 12 in California (<a href=\"https://farmanimalwelfare.substack.com/p/a-big-supreme-court-win-for-farm\"><u>Bollard, 2023</u></a>).</p><h3><strong>3.1.5 Summary and recommendation for next steps</strong></h3><p>In sum, exploring the potential of extending the Shandong guidelines to other asks or other parts of China yields some promising intervention ideas. With the enormous amount of animals farmed in the region and their poor legal protection, improving animal welfare standards could have a large impact. While tractability of policy work in China seems generally low, I found promising signs that (at least some of) the proposed interventions might have a nontrivial chance of success. Given the high stakes, the remaining uncertainties seem worth exploring further, especially the question of whether (parts of) the Shandong guidelines are mandatory. Overcoming language barriers and consulting primary Chinese-language sources seems like a vital next step. Consulting with animal advocates and experts in China, like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/peterlee197499?lang=en\"><u>Peter Li</u></a> of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hsi.org/\"><u>Humane Society International</u></a>, or Sun Jingxin, the author of the Shandong guidelines (<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/06/world/asia/china-shandong-chicken-slaughter.html\"><u>Huang, 2016</u></a>) also seems highly relevant. This can help to understand how neglected these issues are and whether there are certain organisations that could be funded to pursue such interventions. Supporting existing organisations generally seems more promising than incubating a new one, as I expect it to be hard for a new organisation from outside of China to make significant policy progress in the country.</p><p>In short, I suggest deeper research into this topic and consulting with existing animal advocacy groups and experts in China in order to determine next steps.</p><h2>3.2&nbsp; &nbsp; Animal Welfare Act 2006 (United Kingdom)</h2><p>\u201cThe Animal Welfare Act 2006 [...], which came into force in April 2007, is the starting point in respect of the legal protection of vertebrate animals in England and Wales. Certain provisions of the Act extend to Scotland [...], and separate, similar, legislation covers Scotland and Northern Ireland\u201d (<a href=\"https://www.animallaw.info/article/legal-protection-animals-uk\"><u>Collinson, 2018</u></a>). It includes the protection of farmed animals (<a href=\"https://api.worldanimalprotection.org/country/united-kingdom\"><u>World Animal Protection, 2020b</u></a>). However, the standards do not apply to fishing (<a href=\"https://www.animallaw.info/article/legal-protection-animals-uk\"><u>Collinson, 2018</u></a>) and invertebrate animals (<a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/blog/2023/07/24/invertebrate-sentience-welfare-and-policy/\"><u>Crump, 2023</u></a>). Extending the act\u2019s scope to these areas could be a promising topic for campaigns.</p><p>The benefits of such extensions could be very large, as fishing and the farming of invertebrates involve large numbers of animals, even if this only affects the United Kingdom. However, one uncertainty surrounding these extension ideas relates to the Animal Welfare Act\u2019s general nature. As an umbrella law, it might not be specific enough and further policies might need to be enacted on its basis in order to have a direct impact on animal welfare.</p><p>The tractability of achieving the proposed extensions is uncertain. As farmed fish are already included in the Animal Welfare Act, it seems relatively natural to extend the law to fishing / wild fish. However, opposition by the fishing industry can be expected to be strong, as the legislative change could greatly affect them. Also, the law currently only applies to animals that live under human control and it might be argued that fishing is thus not a suitable extension. The recent passing of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Welfare_(Sentience)_Act_2022\"><u>Animal Welfare (Sentience) Act 2022</u></a> suggests that invertebrate issues can benefit from some momentum in British politics, as the sentience of some invertebrates (cephalopods and decapods) was recognised by law.</p><p>Based on my very quick review of this topic, I am also unsure whether anyone is working on these topics already. Given that both fishes and invertebrates are usually among the more neglected animal groups, this issue might be neglected as well. However, I did find evidence that at least some people are already working on the invertebrate side of the issue (<a href=\"https://www.lse.ac.uk/philosophy/blog/2023/07/24/invertebrate-sentience-welfare-and-policy/\"><u>Crump, 2023</u></a>). In addition, there already exist strong animal advocacy groups in the UK and they might be aware of and working on these issues. Aligning with existing groups seems like an important next step in investigating this idea. If they are not already working on it and the idea turns out to be promising upon further analysis, suggesting this intervention idea to them might be more promising than starting a new charity.</p><p>In sum, I suggest that potential extensions to the UK\u2019s Animal Welfare Act 2006 be investigated further in a separate report and potentially suggested as an intervention idea to UK animal advocacy groups.</p><h2>3.3&nbsp; &nbsp; Ohio Administrative Code, Section 901:12 (Ohio, United States)</h2><p>Several states of the United States have passed legislation against the use of cages in farming. The different state laws vary in terms of the animal groups they cover (calves, pigs, and/or chickens). In addition, some states only banned the use of cages in farming within their states, while others included both production and sales in their bans, extending the scope to products originating from other geographic areas that involve the prohibited caging practices. (<a href=\"https://cagefreelaws.com/\"><u>CageFreeLaws, n.d.</u></a>; also see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1muLwRLKWRldDj58AHW4YJGyxKXABJ0Zor8O_-HGE3zo/edit?usp=drive_link\"><u>the specific U.S. cage-free laws tab in the aforementioned spreadsheet</u></a>) It could be promising to ask those states that have only banned production to extend their legislation to sales, as this seems like a natural step that has already been taken by other states. Focusing on chickens as the most numerous group of animals, we identified three states that already had a caged egg production ban that could be extended to sales: Ohio, Rhode Island, and Utah. Ohio is by far the most populous state of these three and should thus have the highest egg consumption among them. Therefore, an extension of the Ohio caged egg production ban to sales could be a promising idea.</p><p>However, the potential impact of such an intervention seems relatively modest. Firstly, Ohio has a population below 12 million (<a href=\"https://www.citypopulation.de/en/usa/states/admin/\"><u>City Population, 2023a</u></a>), a relatively small one compared to the other geographic regions considered for this scoping exercise (for comparison, Shandong\u2019s population is above 100 million (<a href=\"https://www.citypopulation.de/en/china/prov/admin/\"><u>City Population, 2022</u></a>), while that of the UK is around 67 million (<a href=\"https://www.citypopulation.de/en/uk/cities/\"><u>City Population, 2023b</u></a>)). The sales ban would only apply to products from hens, sows, and calves that are consumed by this relatively small population. Secondly, and maybe even more importantly, given that a lot of the products consumed might also be produced in the state (for which a cage ban is already in place), a sales ban is likely to have a limited effect. As Ohio is a major egg producer itself (<a href=\"https://downloads.usda.library.cornell.edu/usda-esmis/files/fb494842n/4b29cj67v/1r66kc90c/ckeg0123.pdf\"><u>United States Department of Agriculture, 2023</u></a>), it seems likely that a large share of eggs consumed would also be produced within the state.</p><p>It also does not seem like this issue is very neglected. Cage-free campaigns in the U.S. have received significant attention from the effective animal advocacy movement over the last years (<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/why-are-the-us-corporate-cage-free-campaigns-succeeding/\"><u>Bollard, 2017</u></a>), Proposition 12 in California was a recent very similar and high-profile case (<a href=\"https://farmanimalwelfare.substack.com/p/a-big-supreme-court-win-for-farm\"><u>Bollard, 2023</u></a>), and there is a specific website dedicated to the cage-free laws in different U.S. states (<a href=\"https://cagefreelaws.com/\"><u>CageFreeLaws, n.d.</u></a>). It seems unlikely that a relatively populous state like Ohio would be neglected by animal advocates in the U.S.</p><p>Still, extending this legislation could be a relatively easy win that animal advocates could pursue. The issue seems highly tractable, given the successes of Prop 12 (in California) and Question 9 (in Massachusetts) and since a production ban is already in place (<a href=\"https://cagefreelaws.com/\"><u>CageFreeLaws, n.d.</u></a>).</p><p>Overall, this extension idea does not seem to warrant much further investigation. It could make sense to quickly check with relevant animal advocates in the United States whether anyone is working on this already and if not, suggest to them that this could be a potential quick win for the cage-free movement. Due to its relatively small scale and scope, this should not warrant a deeper investigation though.</p><h2>3.4&nbsp; &nbsp; Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960 (India)</h2><p>\u201cThe Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960 is the main piece of animal welfare legislation in India. This Act recognises that animals can suffer physically and mentally, and is applicable to \u2018all living creatures\u2019.\u201c (<a href=\"https://api.worldanimalprotection.org/country/india\"><u>World Animal Protection, 2020c</u></a>)</p><p>Currently, the law exempts religious slaughter practices from the requirement of pre-slaughter stunning. World Animal Protection (<a href=\"https://api.worldanimalprotection.org/country/india\"><u>2020c</u></a>) highlights that such an exemption is not necessary for religious freedom though:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThe Government of India is urged to mandate the humane slaughter of all farm animals. Animals should be instantaneously rendered unconscious and insensible to pain and distress prior to slaughter. Today, there is growing consensus amongst religious authorities worldwide that pre-slaughter stunning is compatible with religious principles.&nbsp; Humane halal slaughter allows for the animal to be temporarily rendered unconscious via stunning prior to slaughter, as long as the animal's skull remains intact and the animal would regain consciousness in time should slaughter not occur. Therefore, animals should be unconscious before being bled, and no further processing should occur until irreversible loss of consciousness is confirmed.\u201d</i></p></blockquote><p>This passage suggests that removing religious exceptions is a promising idea for extending the scope of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960. However, I expect such an idea to be very intractable, as I am highly uncertain whether the view expressed by World Animal Protection is one that would meet acceptance among large shares of India\u2019s Muslim population. Religious freedom should be an important right that legislators would not want to overturn and convincing politicians and the public that stunning is not in conflict with religious principles seems to be an uphill battle. Therefore I do not suggest this idea for further investigation.</p><p>Instead, there is another idea for extension that might be promising. As the name says, the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960 is supposed to prevent cruelty to animals, including farmed animals. However, mutilations like castration, tail docking, and dehorning are not considered cruel under the law (<a href=\"https://api.worldanimalprotection.org/country/india\"><u>World Animal Protection, 2020c</u></a>). An extension of the definition of cruelty to include mutilations might thus be promising.</p><p>I am unsure whether anyone is working on this already and did not have the time to check this in depth. Since India is generally one of the more neglected regions globally, this idea might be as well.</p><p>The fact that India has relatively strong animal protection laws in place already and legislators might thus be open to animal advocates\u2019 proposals suggests that this issue might be quite tractable. However, given the law's broad nature, a general proposal on mutilations might be more effective than specific bans or species-focused measures. Such a sweeping change in legislation is a big ask and reduces the tractability for this intervention.</p><p>The scale of this idea also seems large initially, given that India is a major producer of animal products worldwide (<a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/animals-slaughtered-for-meat?tab=table\"><u>Our World in Data, n.d.</u></a>) and mutilations affect almost all farmed land animal groups (<a href=\"https://www.four-paws.org/campaigns-topics/topics/farm-animals/cruel-practices-in-farm-animal-husbandry\"><u>FOUR PAWS, 2023</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5332933/\"><u>Nordquist et al., 2017</u></a>). Mutilations are relevant to at least some marine animals as well (<a href=\"https://www.crustaceancompassion.org/mutilations\"><u>Crustacean Compassion, n.d.</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eurogroupforanimals.org/files/eurogroupforanimals/2022-07/NALB%20Annex%20-%20On-farm%20Welfare%20Standards%20in%20Aquaculture_1.pdf\"><u>Eurogroup for Animals, 2022</u></a>). If the legislative change covered all mutilations, the potential effect for animals would be huge. As highlighted above, such a broad scope seems more fitting than a specific focus on certain animal groups. In addition, if the scope applied to only some kinds of mutilations or animal groups and excluded large-scale issues (e.g. beak trimming for chickens), the scale would be drastically reduced. However, the law\u2019s general nature suggests that it may be too broad to have a specific impact. Current animal protection legislation in India is often not properly enforced (e.g. penalties are too low) (<a href=\"https://www.animallaw.info/article/overview-animal-laws-india\"><u>Kavuri, 2020</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://api.worldanimalprotection.org/country/india\"><u>World Animal Protection, 2020c</u></a>), which also makes it unlikely that additional requirements like a ban of mutilations would be properly enforced. On the positive side, there are some current efforts by legislators to strengthen enforcement and amend the legislation (<a href=\"https://www.freepressjournal.in/india/draft-for-amendment-to-prevention-of-cruelty-to-animal-act-ready-public-comments-sought-3-year-jail-for-gruesome-cruelty-5-for-killing\"><u>FPJ Web Desk, 2022</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Kochi/draft-bill-makes-punishment-for-cruelty-to-animals-more-stringent/article66191926.ece\"><u>Gopakumar, 2022</u></a>).</p><p>Summarising, doubts about enforcement of the existing legislation lead me to question the promisingness of extending the law further. Even if mutilations could be included in the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960, it might be a toothless tiger that does not have real impact for animals. For this reason, I recommend against pursuing this idea further.</p><h2>3.5&nbsp; &nbsp; Regulation 1/2005 (European Union)</h2><p>Under Regulation 1/2005, the European Union sets comprehensive standards for commercial live transports of vertebrate animals (<a href=\"https://www.fondation-droit-animal.org/proceedings-aw/the-european-union-legislation-on-animal-welfare/\"><u>Simonin &amp; Gavinelli, 2019</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>One important aspect of the regulation is that stricter standards apply for transports with a duration of more than eight hours, in order to account for the higher strain on animals (<a href=\"https://www.fondation-droit-animal.org/proceedings-aw/the-european-union-legislation-on-animal-welfare/\"><u>Simonin &amp; Gavinelli, 2019</u></a>). One idea of extending this law might thus be to lower the bar of eight hours, such that higher welfare standards would also be applicable to shorter transports. A quick evaluation of this idea did not seem promising though and it does not seem worth investigating further. While the idea might be tractable (even though I did not investigate this in much detail), the scale of this issue seems small, as the bar could probably not be lowered too drastically (mostly due to industry opposition and economic considerations) and the change would thus only affect a relatively small share of animal transports in the EU. Also, legislative work in the EU is not neglected at all, even though I am uncertain if anyone is working on this issue specifically.</p><p>Another idea to extend this legislation relates to animal groups covered by it. \u201cMost technical requirements [...] are designed for terrestrial farmed animals even if some administrative requirements remain applicable to other species (wild animals, dogs and cats, experimental animals, farmed fish, etc.).\u201d</p><p>Extending the full standards to apply to farmed fish as well could have a large impact for animals, given the large numbers of farmed fish generally (<a href=\"https://www.sentienceinstitute.org/global-animal-farming-estimates\"><u>Anthis &amp; Anthis, 2019</u></a>) and the fact that live fish transports seem common in the EU (<a href=\"https://www.ccmar.ualg.pt/en/news/european-parliament-discusses-transport-live-farmed-fish-based-ccmar-study\"><u>Centro de Ciencias do Mar, 2021</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2021/690875/IPOL_STU(2021)690875_EN.pdf\"><u>Saraiva et al., 2021</u></a>).</p><p>The research reports cited for the prevalence of live fish transports (<a href=\"https://www.ccmar.ualg.pt/en/news/european-parliament-discusses-transport-live-farmed-fish-based-ccmar-study\"><u>Centro de Ciencias do Mar, 2021</u></a>;&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/STUD/2021/690875/IPOL_STU(2021)690875_EN.pdf\"><u>Saraiva et al., 2021</u></a>) also suggest that legislators have already expressed some interest in this topic. So while opposition from industry might be strong on this issue (due to its large impact), the idea should be modestly tractable.</p><p>Concerns around the low neglectedness of EU policy work mentioned above apply to this extension idea as well. However, to my knowledge,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.eurogroupforanimals.org/what-we-do/areas-of-concern/most-animal-welfare-rules-do-not-apply-imported-products\"><u>Eurogroup for Animals</u></a> (probably the most prominent advocacy group for animals at the level of EU policy) does not focus much on fish. Fish transport is also not part of the initial scope of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/2Nnu9ykixiqG2mMit/ce-announcing-our-february-2024-charity-ideas-apply-now\"><u>Charity Entrepreneurship</u></a>\u2019s soon-to-be incubated charity working on fish welfare in Greece.</p><p>Nevertheless, I decided against investigating this issue further, due to the strong ongoing policy advocacy efforts by other groups. It might be promising though to bring this idea to their attention as a potential policy proposal to consider in their future efforts.</p><h2>3.6&nbsp; &nbsp; Directive 98/58 (European Union)</h2><p>Another piece of EU legislation that seemed promising to extend is Directive 98/58, containing general provisions for the farming of animals (<a href=\"https://www.fondation-droit-animal.org/proceedings-aw/the-european-union-legislation-on-animal-welfare/\"><u>Simonin &amp; Gavinelli, 2019</u></a>).</p><p>One idea for extension I considered was to push for the extension of these standards beyond production within the EU, such that imports would also be covered by them. I disregarded this idea fairly quickly though, as I found Eurogroup for Animals (<a href=\"https://www.eurogroupforanimals.org/what-we-do/areas-of-concern/most-animal-welfare-rules-do-not-apply-imported-products\"><u>n.d.</u></a>) to already be working on the topic of imports. In addition, I was unsure whether Directive 98/58 could even be used to cover specific imports, as it seemed too vague and broad to be directly applicable here. It should be more promising to push for import coverage for other directives that apply to specific animals and farming practices.</p><p>Similar to Regulation 1/2005 described above, I did find a promising idea though when it comes to extending this directive to fish. Simonin and Gavinelli (<a href=\"https://www.fondation-droit-animal.org/proceedings-aw/the-european-union-legislation-on-animal-welfare/\"><u>2019</u></a>) write:</p><blockquote><p><i>\u201cThis directive contains general provisions applicable to all vertebrate farmed species but the annex to the directive does not apply to fish, reptiles and amphibians. This annex contains very general requirements (staff, record keeping, freedom of movement, accommodation, equipment, feed and water, mutilations and breeding procedures) which tend to reflect the principles of the five freedoms initially developed in the United Kingdom\u201d.</i></p></blockquote><p>Extending the annex of this directive to also apply to farmed fish might therefore be promising. It is important to note however that I did not check the exact contents of this annex besides what is described above, given the shallow nature of this scoping exercise. Doing so is an important next step for further research.</p><p>Apart from this, the crucial considerations for this idea are similar as for the fish extension idea investigated for Regulation 1/2005. The scale of the issue is high, given the large numbers in which fish are farmed. EU policy work is not very neglected, but fish welfare work seems to receive less attention than other issues. Tractability seems slightly more uncertain here, as I have no signs that legislators are already interested in this issue, opposition from industry might be strong, and legislators will probably be hesitant to apply the same rules to fish as to farmed land animals.</p><p>Overall, my perspective on this is similar to Regulation 1/2005. I decided against investigating this issue further, due to the strong ongoing policy advocacy efforts by other groups. It might be promising though to bring this idea to their attention as a potential policy proposal to consider in their future efforts.</p><h2>3.7&nbsp; &nbsp; Other ideas</h2><p>While the laws outlined above represent those that seem most promising for extension, the scoping exercise revealed many other interesting ideas for extensions of animal protection laws. The full list can be found in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1muLwRLKWRldDj58AHW4YJGyxKXABJ0Zor8O_-HGE3zo/edit?usp=drive_link\"><u>the aforementioned spreadsheet</u></a>, but some interesting ideas seem worth listing here for illustration:</p><ul><li>Brazil\u2019s Normative Instruction No 46 of 2018, which provides minimum standards for live animal transports of cows, buffalo, sheep, and goats, could be extended to animal groups that are not already covered under the law (e.g. pigs or chickens), to impose stricter standards, or to even include a ban of live exports.</li><li>The United States\u2019 Animal Welfare Act, which is the country\u2019s primary federal animal protection law, could be extended to cover (at least some) farmed animals, as it currently mostly relates to pets, animals kept in zoos, and animals used in laboratories.</li><li>Indonesia\u2019s Law 18 of 2009, which includes provisions for the proper slaughter of farmed animals, could be extended to mandate pre-slaughter stunning.</li><li>The United States\u2019 Twenty-Eight Hour Law, which sets standards for farmed animal transports across state lines, could be extended to include farmed birds in its scope.</li><li>Germany\u2019s ban of chick culling could be extended to the whole EU. This would require a completely new law at the EU level though and is less of an extension of an existing law.</li></ul><p>Some of these ideas might be interesting for further research, but had to be deprioritised for this exercise, as other ideas for extending existing laws seemed more promising.</p><h1>4 &nbsp; &nbsp; Conclusion and next steps</h1><p>In this report, I have analysed a variety of existing animal protection laws that could be promising to extend to adjacent areas. This was chosen as a research area, as extending existing laws might be more tractable than proposing completely new ones.</p><p>The laws and ideas I examined were defined by a step-wise research process, gradually narrowing down the laws and ideas to arrive at a set that seemed most promising. I shallowly evaluated some crucial considerations for these topics, which forms the basis for the following recommendations for next steps:</p><ul><li>Investigate potential extensions to the Shandong guidelines on chicken handling, transport, and slaughter in more depth, consulting with existing animal advocacy groups and experts in China in order to determine next steps. Based on the findings of this further research, potentially suggest this as an intervention idea to Chinese animal advocacy groups and fund their work.</li><li>Investigate potential extensions to the UK\u2019s Animal Welfare Act 2006 in more depth. Based on the findings of this further research, potentially suggest this as an intervention idea to UK animal advocacy groups and fund their work.</li><li>Suggest a potential extension of the Ohio Administrative Code, Section 901:12, as an intervention idea to existing animal advocacy groups in the U.S., which they might pursue or investigate further.</li><li>Do not investigate potential extensions to India\u2019s Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act 1960 further.</li><li>Suggest potential extensions of EU Regulation 1/2005 and Directive 98/58 as an intervention idea to existing animal advocacy groups at the EU level, which they might pursue or investigate further.</li></ul><p>Overall, this report aims to provide a foundation for further in-depth research and exploration of these topics.</p><h1>References</h1><p>Anthis, K., &amp; Anthis J.

I have a few thoughts, including about how my views have evolved over time. This is a very different perspective than many in Effective Altruism, but I think it\u2019s important as a member of a community that benefits from being diverse rather than monolithic for those who dissent from community consensus make it clear that it\u2019s acceptable to do so. Hopefully, this can be useful both to other people who are interested in a more Jewish perspective, and for everyone else interested in thinking about balancing different personal views with effective giving.</p><h2>Background</h2><p>To start, there is a strong Jewish tradition, and a legal requirement in the Shulchan Aruch, the code of Jewish law, for giving at least ten percent of your income to the poor and to community organizations - and for those who can afford it, ideally, a fifth of their income. (For some reason, no-one ever points out that second part.)</p><p>So I always gave a tenth of my income to charity, even before starting my first post-college job, per Jewish customary law. My parents inculcated this as a value since childhood, and a norm, and it\u2019s one I am grateful for. (One thing I did differently than most, and credit my sister with suggesting, is putting 10% of my paycheck directly in a second account which was exclusively for charity. That money wasn\u2019t mine, and made it much easier to both track donations, and not feel the \u201cpain\u201d of giving away my money.)&nbsp;</p><p>My giving as a child, and as a young adult, largely centered on local Jewish organizations, poverty assistance for local poor people and the poor in Israel, and community organizations I interacted with. In the following years, I started thinking more critically about my giving, and charity to community organizations seemed in tension with a more universalist impulse, what you might call \u201cTikkun Olam\u201d- a directive to improve the world as a whole. I was very conflicted about this for quite some time, but have come to some tentative conclusions, and I wanted to outline my current views, informed by a combination of the Jewish sources and my other beliefs.</p><h2>Judaism vs. Utilitarians</h2><p>I am lucky enough, like most people I know personally, to have significantly more money than is strictly needed to feed, clothe, and house myself and my family. The rest of the money, however, needs to be allocated - for savings, for entertainment, for community, and for charity. And my conclusion, after reflection about the question, is that those last two are separate both conceptually and as a matter of Jewish conception of charity. My synagogue is a wonderful community institution that I benefit from, and I believe it is proper to pay my fair share. And in&nbsp;<i>Halacha</i>, Jewish law, community organizations are valid recipients of charity. But there is also a strong justification for prioritizing giving to those most in need.</p><p>Utilitarian philosophers have advocated for a giving on an impartial basis, seeing a contradiction between universalism and their \u201cselfish\u201d impulse to justify keeping more than a minimal amount of their own money. To maximize global utility, all money over a bare minimum should go to those most in need, or otherwise be maximally impactful. In contrast, Halacha is clear that you and your family come first, and giving more than a token amount of charity must wait until your family\u2019s needs are met. More than that, it is clearly opposed to giving more than 20% of your income under usual circumstances, i.e. short of significant excess wealth. And once you are giving to charity, Jewish sources suggest progressively growing moral circles, first giving to family in need, then neighbors, then the community. In contrast to this, Jewish law also contains a preference for helping those most in need, rather than those locally who have less need. The tension between these two ideas is left largely to personal choices about prioritizing giving.</p><p>Differently contrasting, utilitarian philosophers have advocated for a quantified evaluation of how to do the most good on an impartial basis, globally. On the other side, in medieval and earlier Jewish sources, it is clear that once needs are met, giving was concentrated on local needs, specifically food banks, the immediate needs of those forced by poverty into collecting charity and paying for the redemption of captives. But these sources predate both modern communication, and modern econometrics and notions of evaluating impact. Given all of that, I\u2019ve argued that the two viewpoints, while incompatible, are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nomos-elibrary.de/10.5771/9783748925361-77.pdf\"><u>less fundamentally opposed than they seem</u></a>.</p><h2>My Views</h2><p>Obviously, charity is a deeply personal decision - but it\u2019s also a key way to impact the world, and an expression of religious belief, and both are important to me. Partly due to my experience, I think it\u2019s important to dedicate money to giving thoughtfully and in advance, rather than doing so on an ad-hoc basis - and I have done this since before hearing about Effective Altruism. But inspired by Effective Altruism and organizations like Givewell, I now dedicate 10% of my income to charities that have been evaluated for effectiveness, and which are aligned with my beliefs about charitable giving.</p><p>In contrast to the norm in effective altruism, I only partially embrace cause neutrality. I think it\u2019s an incomplete expression of how my charity should impact the world. For that reason, I split my charitable giving between effective charities which I personally view as valuable, and deference to cause-neutral experts on the most impactful opportunities. Everyone needs to find their own balance, and I have tremendous respect for people who donate more, but I\u2019ve been happy with my decision to limit my effective charitable giving at 10%, and beyond that, I still feel free to donate to other causes, including those that can\u2019t be classified as effective at all.</p><p>As suggested above, community is an important part of my budget. A conclusion I came to after reflecting on the question, and grappling with effective altruism, is that separate from charitable giving, I think it\u2019s important to pay for public goods you benefit from, both narrow ones like community organizations, and broader ones. I think it\u2019s worth helping to fund community centers, and why I paid for NPR membership when I lived in the US, and why I&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/brTXG5pS3JgTatP7i/carbon-offsets-as-an-non-altruistic-expense\"><u>pay to offset carbon emissions to reduce the harms of climate change</u></a></p><h2>My Giving</h2><p>For donations deferring to cause-neutral experts, I usually give via&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/\"><u>Givewell</u></a>, and split my giving between their top charities, focused on validated and known effective global health programs, and their all grants fund, which also includes a variety of more speculative and diverse programs, from funding randomized controlled trials of new projects in agricultural aid and support, to lead exposure prevention and water chlorination.</p><p>For donations that are not fully cause-neutral, I still prioritize impact, but give more weight to whether they are aligned with my views. That includes Givedirectly, which directly fulfills the imperative to give charity to those in need, and which I see as more empowering of individuals than other cause-neutral impactful charities. I also donate to climate change mitigation above the level of offsetting personal carbon emissions, especially because of my views about contractarian obligation not to harm others,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/moral-offsetting\"><u>moral offsetting</u></a> the direct harms done by my emissions, and the distributional impacts of climate change - but doing so is tricky, so I often&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.founderspledge.com/funds/climate-change-fund\"><u>defer to experts</u></a> on how best to support emissions reductions.&nbsp;</p><p>Probably most controversially, while I view existential risk reduction work as tremendously important, I don\u2019t donate any of the 10% of my income dedicated to effective charity in order to support this work. (I do view it as a critical global priority, which is why the vast majority of my time and effort are spent on it!) Principally, my lack of donations is because I don\u2019t view the cause area as a charitable endeavor, rather than rational self-interest for myself and my family, which has obvious benefits to the broader world. This does not make it less important, but does, in my idiosyncratic view, make it less obviously charity in the sense that I have committed to giving.</p><p>Lastly, local organizations or those where I have personal affiliations or feel responsibilities towards are also important to me - but as with existential risk, this is conceptually separate from giving charity effectively, and as I mentioned, I donate separately from the 10% dedicated to charity. I give to other organizations, including my synagogue and other local community organizations, especially charities that support the local poor around Jewish holidays, and other personally meaningful projects. But in the spirit of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/3p3CYauiX8oLjmwRF/purchase-fuzzies-and-utilons-separately\"><u>purchasing fuzzies separately</u></a>, this is done with a smaller total amount, separate from my effective giving. I have also occasionally supported political campaigns in the US, but again, don\u2019t see this as quite the same as charity, even though I think it\u2019s potentially very impactful.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>I don\u2019t view my ideas about giving as something to promote as a universal norm, and don\u2019t think that others should copy them exactly. I do think that it\u2019s important to point out that people can find a balance between their personal views and their commitments to the world which are sustainable and healthy for themselves. As it was put recently,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/89GdH5unSb2Sze6kj/elements-of-ea-your-ea-identity-can-be-bespoke\"><u>keep your identity bespoke</u></a>. Hopefully, this has contributed to the discussion of balancing personal priorities and altruism, even though I expect most people to disagree with my specific conclusions.</p><p><i>I'd like to thank Ben Schifman and Solly Silverstein for their comments on an earlier draft.</i></p>", "user": {"username": "Davidmanheim"}}, {"_id": "RdxW3vFsykQNo44xG", "title": "Immutable Spirits: Not One More Lost; Not One Forgotten", "postedAt": "2023-12-01T10:32:05.753Z", "htmlBody": "<p><i>Author's note: This piece is heavily inspired by </i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/jk7A3NMdbxp65kcJJ/500-million-but-not-a-single-one-more\"><i>Jai's piece</i></a><i>.</i></p><p>In the shadow of the modern era, an unseen adversary emerged, unlike any before. Its victims, countless and nameless, faced a silent struggle against an invisible foe\u2014HIV/AIDS. From the 1980s onwards, this insidious force claimed lives globally, leaving families shattered and communities in despair.</p><p>The first casualties vanished into the abyss, their stories untold, as a mysterious virus took hold. It spared no continent, crossing borders effortlessly, devastating lives in its wake. In the throes of the epidemic, societies grappled with fear, confusion, and discrimination, confronting a menace that defied comprehension.</p><p>Yet, amidst the darkness, a glimmer of hope emerged. The resilience of humanity sparked a determined effort to understand and combat this modern-day scourge. Scientific minds rallied, researchers delved into uncharted territories, and communities united to confront the stigma surrounding the virus.</p><p>Through the years, as the understanding of HIV/AIDS grew, so did the collective will to fight. Individuals, once divided, found common ground in a shared battle against an indiscriminate adversary. The global response mirrored a changing world, where information flowed across borders and innovations in medicine offered new possibilities.</p><p>Antiretroviral treatments became the shield against this unseen enemy. Those who survived bore witness to the transformative power of unity and knowledge. The narrative shifted from despair to empowerment as communities embraced education, prevention, and compassion.</p><p>In the 21st century, breakthroughs in medical science offered a ray of hope. The global community, now armed with knowledge and solidarity, worked towards a future where HIV/AIDS would no longer cast its long shadow. Advocates, scientists, and everyday heroes stood on the front lines, challenging the virus that once seemed invincible.</p><p>Remembering those who succumbed to this modern plague, we acknowledge the progress made. Though the battle against HIV/AIDS is ongoing, the strides taken reflect the indomitable spirit of humanity. On this day, let us pay tribute to the lives lost, celebrate the progress achieved, and recommit ourselves to a world where HIV/AIDS is a distant memory.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.unaids.org/en/World_AIDS_Day\">Happy HIV/AIDS Awareness Day.</a></p>", "user": {"username": "Tim K.

I am a third year student at UC Berkeley that has worked with Effective Altruism for about a year now. Under the direction of <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/robert-van-buskirk-1?mention=user\">@Robert Van Buskirk</a> &nbsp;(founder of Solar4Africa.org), myself and fellow Berkeley student Sam Miller have been working on an EA-related project that deals with Solar4Africa\u2019s solar-electric cooking systems; our project is concerned with the overall refinement of the intervention and the cost-effectiveness of the cooking systems. The purpose of this post is to broadly explain our intervention and its relevance to the EA community, as well as introduce the methodology that we plan to use throughout the project. Please note that any sort of feedback/comments would be greatly appreciated!</p><h3><strong><u>General Description of Intervention</u></strong></h3><p>Solar4Africa\u2019s Project #4 aims to assess the possible humanitarian benefits that the adoption of long-lasting solar electric cooking systems has on communities in rural Malawi. By replacing biomass sources such as firewood or crop residue for cooking, offgrid solar electricity provides the opportunity for cleaner, cheaper and longer-lasting energy. Furthermore, due to extremely deflated prices in rural Malawi, cash transfers or subsidized solar energy systems can generate substantial economic revenue for beneficiaries.</p><p>Solar4Africa Project #4\u2019s goal is to provide and distribute philanthropically-supported offgrid cooking systems to women\u2019s groups and households that are efficiently subsidized so that they generate benefits that far outweigh the initial cost of the cooking system and where philanthropic subsidies are cost-effective from an EA perspective. To do this the cooker systems are designed to last from 5 to 15 years due to their long lasting solar panels and specialized batteries, thus generating large sums of consumption income and health benefits over the system lifetime.&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://mecs.org.uk/blog/atec-and-fairclimatefund-launch-cook-to-earn-based-on-fair-principles/\"><u>Some clean cooking projects</u></a> are starting to use carbon credit finance as a means of providing cash transfers to households that are using clean cooking technologies. The poverty-reduction benefits of the cash transfers justify a higher carbon credit price because of the non-climate co-benefits of the project that they create. Solar4Africa is considering using a similar approach where the revenues from carbon finance are used co-finance poverty-reduction and health benefits. If the cost of clean cooking can be justified based on multiple benefits, then the amount of finance that is cost-effective is more than what can be justified from the consideration of only one type of benefit.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong><u>Health Benefits</u></strong></h3><p>In rural areas of Malawi there is almost a universal use of biomass for cooking, leading to poor air quality within households and overexposure to carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate pollution. According to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6163876/\"><u>This journal article</u></a>, cooking methods with improved combustion efficiency (compared to open fires) are able to reduce harmful emissions by anywhere from 75% to 90% in Malawi, which is a significant improvement. Using&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-compare/#\"><u>this VizHub data</u></a>, we can see that lower-respiratory infections in Malawi has a disease burden of 2,779 DALYs per 100,000 people per year.&nbsp;This means that the respiratory disease burden for 5 people over five years will be: (2,779)x(5 people x 5 years)/100,000 = 0.695 DALYs. Using the above journal\u2019s optimistic estimates of emission reductions, let\u2019s say that Solar4Africa\u2019s solar electric cookers&nbsp;decrease respiratory disease by 30%. It could potentially generate a health benefit of: 30% x 0.695 = 0.2085 DALYs for 5 people over 5 years.&nbsp;</p><p>While there is a real possibility that Solar4Africa\u2019s solar electric cookers will have health benefits for long-term users, we acknowledge that organizations have been critical of previous claims of the health impacts of improved cooking. Though we note that Solar4Africa\u2019s intervention is not an improved biomass stove, but an off-grid solar electric stove which is quite different. For improved biomass stoves, t<a href=\"https://www.givewell.org/international/technical/programs/clean-cookstoves\"><u>his GiveWell report</u></a> finds that improved cookstoves may have \u201climited impacts on women\u2019s health and no clear impacts on children\u2019s health under typical use.\u201d&nbsp; Specifically, the GiveWell evaluation notes: \u201cDistributions of clean [biomass] cookstoves may have been less effective than expected due to implementation challenges, such as low compliance with using the replacement stoves and failure of the cleaner stoves to reduce air pollution sufficiently.\u201d&nbsp;</p><h3><strong><u>Monetary Benefits</u></strong></h3><p>Health benefits are not the only positive of adapting solar cookers.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/14/14/4293\"><u>This article</u></a><u> </u>discusses the monetary benefits of solar cookers. The discussion notes that \u201c[S]olar panels that provide direct digital synthesis (DDS) electricity can last 20 years or more, and lithium-titanium-oxide (LTO) batteries have a life cycle of 10,000 cycles or more.\u201d This incredibly long life span of a single solar cooker has enabled solar panels to be as \u2014if not more -\u2013 cost effective than wood burning stoves in the long term. However, several barriers remain which inhibit solar electric cookers from completely being more cost effective than wood cookers. Firstly, low-cost wood cookers (meaning when wood efficiencies are high, fuel is inexpensive, and quality of fuel is high) outperform solar electric cookers in terms of cost. Secondly, in order for solar electric cookers to be as cost effective as possible, a low cost approach of efficiently importing and distributing batteries must be implemented. We do believe, however, that the implementation of long-lasting solar electric cookers will generate a great amount of benefit for the beneficiaries (see cost-effectiveness calculation methodology below).</p><h3><strong><u>Related EA Posts</u></strong></h3><p>One related&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/EAA5YeR6s6Ye2cZjD/soaking-beans-a-cost-effectiveness-analysis\"><u>EA post</u></a> titled \u201cSoaking Beans\u2013a cost-effectiveness analysis\u201d provides an estimate of the potential benefits that soaking beans would have. This post is one of the few documents that addresses an improved cooking intervention in Africa from an EA perspective.&nbsp;</p><p>In the post, the author notes that beans make up an estimated 25 percent of an average Ugandan\u2019s calorie intake and 40 percent of their daily protein intake. Beans have a large cooking time, which means that lots of wood and charcoal is required in the cooking process. The analysis states that soaking beans could reduce the cooking time by 20-50 percent, thereby reducing the amount of wood and charcoal used. The analysis takes into consideration a variety of benefits from a shorter cooking time, including reduced CO2 emissions from charcoal and wood burning, and monetary savings. If one percent of the Ugandan population started soaking beans, the reduction in CO2 emissions totals at 76,249 tons. Due to Ugandan\u2019s decreased expenditures on wood and charcoal (not as much wood and charcoal would be needed due to the shorter cooking time) the analysis estimates that roughly 1.5 million dollars (U.S.) would be saved if 1 percent of the Ugandan population started soaking beans.</p><p><br>There is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/cz85mufYwiiukpowD/clean-cookstoves-may-be-competitive-with-givewell\"><u>another EA post</u></a>&nbsp; titled \u201cClean cookstoves may be competitive with GiveWell-recommended charities\u201d that models the intervention of clean cookstoves. Their model considers the implementation of clean cookstoves and focuses primarily on its health benefits; this is different from our intervention because we plan to generate long-lasting benefits that accrue both monetary and health benefits over time. Using their own cost effectiveness model, the EA post finds that there is the possibility of cost-per-life-saved of $11,800. The post acknowledges the challenges that clean cookstove interventions pose, citing \u201cWe are aware that J-PAL has reviewed this question some time ago and concluded that this is difficult. More recently IDinsight considered this topic and found that it can be made to work.\u201d&nbsp;</p><h3><strong><u>Cost-effectiveness Estimation Methodology</u></strong></h3><p>The cost-effectiveness calculations that we plan to follow will be an adaptation of what is provided at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/icxnuEHTXrPapHBQg/a-simplified-cost-effectiveness-estimation-methodology-for\"><u>this EA post</u></a>. In this post, Robert lays out a simplified version of how we will be able to calculate marginal cost effectiveness as an inverse of marginal cost of unit of impact. The data that we will use to assess the cost effectiveness of Project #4 will be derived from (a) the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.healthdata.org/research-analysis/gbd\"><u>2019 Global Burden of Disease</u></a> data, which is synthesized to estimate mortality, health outcomes, and risks of various diseases across the globe in DALYs and YYLs, and (b) data from Solar4Africa activities and demonstration tests.</p><h3><br><strong><u>Conclusion</u></strong></h3><p>We are very excited to continue Solar4Africa\u2019s Project #4 throughout the year, and plan to upload a follow-up post in the next month or so regarding our progress and cost-effective analysis.

Vaccines are arguably the most powerful tool to counter infectious diseases and still have a lot of room for improvement in terms of efficiency and number of pathogens that can be combatted.</p><p>Vaccines are relatively neglected: the field is smaller and receives less investment than many other domains of biology and medicine despite higher scope. In particular, certain specific research and engineering questions within vaccinology appear unduly neglected compared to their expected returns (see a tentative list of such topics below).</p><p>Actions to bring the field forward are tractable. Not only biologists and medical professionals can get involved, but also engineers, administrators and IT professionals, and there are options to fund impactful work on vaccines.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Report</strong></h2><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the coming decades, mankind is going to face the severe (potentially even existential) health threats of probable emerging pandemics, whether natural or man-made, as well as the already ongoing rise of antimicrobial resistance. In addition, infectious diseases still represent a major cause of mortality, especially in the tropics, with probably 20-25% of world deaths [1]. Vaccination is one of the most powerful tools to combat each of these threats, and therefore in my opinion one of the highest impact fields for biological research and industry. In this essay, I intend to provide a rational assessment of the impact of research in vaccinology and related domains, as well as examples of topics where people from different areas of expertise may contribute the most to medical progress.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For context, I am a last year PhD student working on adenovirus vector biotechnology. This essay is the result of my reflexions on EA oriented biological research, my PhD work, readings and writings [2] on the antimicrobial resistance (AMR) crisis, exchanges with experts and participation to the ISV vaccine congress. I will mainly focus on academic research because that\u2019s what I know best, but I will also try to give advice for careers in industry and policy-making although that will be less detailed. This report is destined in particular to students aligned with EA values: I hope this report will help them get the information necessary to choose their studies and career paths.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Although the concept of vaccine dates back more than two centuries, clinically approved vaccines are available against only around 30 human pathogens out of hundreds [3]. Furthermore, the evolution of existing pathogens and the emergence of new ones constantly threatens to annihilate the progress already achieved. Fortunately, the recent surge of new technologies (lipid nanoparticles, viral vectors, designer protein subunits...) and the rapid improvement of the understanding of immunology is leading to the establishment of numerous more efficient ways to train our immune system and the vaccinology R&amp;D field is poised to qualitatively expand. Recent successes, including the mRNA COVID vaccines and the WHO recommendation of two vaccines against the still deadly malaria disease [4] may be followed by dozens of others, and significantly decrease the worldwide burden of infectious diseases, if well-targeted research efforts are conducted and industry and governments are willing to follow.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Why you may not want to work in vaccinology:</h3><ol><li>I prefer to work on other answers to the antimicrobial resistance crisis</li></ol><p>Many pathogenic bacteria are evolving resistance against antibiotics, the current gold standard of treatment. They already kill more than one million people per year and this number may grow tenfold within one generation because the improvement of antibiotics doesn\u2019t keep up with the propagation of resistance. Potential solutions to the AMR crisis would thus have an extremely high positive impact [5], and both human and veterinary vaccines may play an important role toward this goal. However, other options are under investigation, including new classes of antibiotics [6], phage therapy, lysins and improved protection and diagnostic equipment.</p><p>In 2018, the company Acahogen had its new antibiotic plazomicin approved by the FDA, but ran bankrupt a few months later because profits could not match the huge expense undertaken in clinical trials. This example shows that fighting scientific discoveries won\u2019t have a significant impact against AMR unless the medical, industry and government fields are ready to test and deploy new solutions at the required scale. Although progress has been made, AMR is still very neglected compared to its present and future scope and a lot of effort in communication and politics is required to raise public mobilisation and create economic environment that can sustain the deployment of innovative therapies.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. I prefer to work on biorisk management and policy</p><p>Future pandemics may be the result of human malevolence or negligence. Although vaccines help to decrease the risk that emerging diseases represent, other approaches may be equally or more impactful, such as regulating research and preparing countermeasures to avoid careless manipulations to cause damage, or developing equipments and protocols so that research and medicine can keep working even in destabilized societies. Since societal collapse and existentially threatening pandemics are impossible to predict and somewhat unlikely, this area appears high-risk high-reward in terms of impact, in opposition to the more secure and short-termist vaccine field.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. Most of the research in vaccines is relatively inefficient</p><p>As in most professional areas, a lot of players in vaccinology do not perform well and economic incentives are not always aligned with real long-term societal needs. This means that the really high-performing teams may be hard to find and offer a limited number of positions.</p><p>Since vaccinology is clinic-oriented and clinical trials often last a decade and cost hundreds of millions of dollars, it has long been limited by the slow-moving, risk-averse big pharmaceutical companies. Recent public investments to de-risk the field are accelerating developments and the various epidemics of the last two decades have taught the different actors of the field to cooperate efficiently, which means that it is now much easier to fund impactful vaccine R&amp;D and there are straightforward highways to bring promising products to the clinic. Nevertheless, certain areas remain neglected by the big companies driving the field, especially concerning innovative technologies that still need a lot of time to bear fruits.</p><p>On the other hand, a relatively large part of the vaccine community focuses on very fundamental questions that may never find concrete applications. Furthermore, successful vaccine development requires the cooperation of many different domains (immunology, pharmacology, microbiology, manufacture...) already at an early stage, but because of the difficulty to coordinate efficiently researchers or teams with very different skillsets, these subfields remain in some instances compartmentalized. Another dividing factor is the separation between academia, startups and big pharmaceutical companies, which operate under different constraints and often pursue conflicting goals. However, as mentioned before the integration and interconnectedness of vaccinology is progressing as indicated by the fast-increasing number of collaborations, the improving transparency of pharmaceutical companies and the recent public large-scale coordination and support structures for vaccine R&amp;D such as operation warp speed and CEPI (see below).</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Relatively neglected research axes with high potential:</h3><ol><li>Mucosal vaccines</li></ol><p>Most currently used vaccines are administered in muscles, leading to suboptimal protection at the actual site of infection for most pathogens (respiratory tract, intestine, etc.). Indeed, these mucosa have a specific immune system that is not entirely connected with systemic immunity. Although the awareness for the need of mucosal vaccines is rising, solutions are still rare. Currently, the main limitations of mucosal vaccines are first, the difficulty for vaccine components to cross the mucosa physical and chemical barriers that separate the organism from its environment and microbiota; and second, peripheral tolerance, a process through which the immune system does not fight antigens found in mucosa [7]. Although peripheral tolerance helps the body not to overreact against microbiota and food, it is to be avoided for efficient mucosal vaccination. Research on these particular areas is warranted.</p><p>In addition, the mucosal immunity and its reaction to vaccines is still quite poorly understood, and fundamental research on this topic would probably help solve the current issues of mucosal vaccines, in particular by establishing animal models relevant for human applications and identifying correlates of protection.</p><p>Given that each mucosa represents a different environment, vaccines suited for one administration route (e.g. pill for sublingual delivery) may not be optimal to protect other mucosa (e.g. sexually transmitted pathogens). However, the buccal mucosa is sufficiently connected with several other organs [7] for pill-formulated vaccines to represent a priority target, with the additional advantage of easily upscalable and low-cost needle-free administration, and thinner mucus easier to cross by vaccine components.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs)</p><p>This type of vaccine, still experimental, is produced from membranes of gram-negative bacteria that express and present the desired vaccine antigens. Advantages of this technology include low cost and easy production even in low and middle income countries (LMIC) and high immunogenicity due to the display of bacterial proteins and sugars, making adjuvants unnecessary and further decreasing vaccine costs [8]. OMVs appear in particular to be very promising in the fight against AMR. Currently, the main limitations of OMVs are heterogeneity of vaccine batches and difficulties to upscale.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. Universal vaccines</p><p>Although very efficient against the original pandemic coronavirus strains, COVID vaccines only offer a limited protection against new variants. This narrowness of protection is shared by numerous other vaccines, for example it\u2019s the reason why flu vaccines are modified each year to account for the evolution of influenza viruses. Moreover, current vaccines would not protect against an emerging pathogen distantly related to the microbe they have been designed for.</p><p>The aim of universal vaccines is to protect against an entire family of pathogens. They would not only better combat immune-evading variants than more restricted vaccines, but could also in theory prevent pandemics emergence if made available for a broad range of pathogen families that have a high risk of causing pandemics.</p><p>The research on universal vaccines focused so far on coronaviruses and influenza. The leading approach consists in choosing protein fragments of the very well-known SARS-CoV-2 spike protein coming from different variants, based on informatic modeling of the complementarity of antibodies that these variants induced in patients. Finally, all the fragments are fused together in order to train the immune system of vaccinated people to recognize them all [9]. Although heavily reliant on clinical data and pathogen-specific datasets in this example, universal vaccines may soon be extended to other pathogen families. Moderna announced their goal to develop universal vaccines for each major virus family until 2030. This seems excessively ambitious, but even if they establish only one such vaccine this would already be a major success.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4. Vaccines for neglected tropical diseases (NTD)</p><p>\u201cNeglected tropical diseases\u201d designates a diverse set of infectious diseases prevalent in LMIC (malaria, tuberculosis, trypanosomiasis, schistosomiasis, ascariasis...) which all combined still kill more than 2 million people per year and handicap many more. As their name indicates, the medical and economic investments against these conditions are very low compared to their heavy burden on world health [10]. The situation is slowly improving, once again largely thanks to the efforts of CEPI, Gates fundation and the Wellcome trust, but R&amp;D of vaccines against NTDs remains deficient and largely limited to academia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5. Vaccine manufacturing</p><p>The COVID pandemics showed how difficult it is to produce and distribute high-quality, low-cost vaccines to the entire world quickly. Although vaccine design was completed only a few weeks after the publication of the SARS-CoV-2 genome in January 2020, it took more than one and a half years to vaccinate most of the population of the richest countries, and in many LMIC vaccine coverage remains incomplete to this day. As the expected deadlines to distribute vaccines after the start of the pandemics are becoming tighter, manufacturing needs to be accelerated without losing in quality; and as numerous innovative new types of vaccines are designed, the manufacture constraints need to be dealt with already at early stages. Furthermore, needle-injected vaccines present significant inconvenients because they rebuke many people and the need for health professionals to administer them slows deployment down, so other delivery methods such as pills, micropatches and nasal sprays may improve vaccine usage and acceptance [11,12]. Manufacturing requires the coordination of different specialities, from basic biologists to pharmacologists and engineers.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6. Vaccine vector mechanistic immunology</p><p>The final effects of vaccines on the immune system (above all IgG secretion and T cell responses) are well understood, but the complex biological processes that lead to vaccine administration to these final responses are in many instances poorly characterized. Having a detailed idea of which vaccine components induce which biological pathway would help to predict in advance which changes can be applied to improve vaccines. This topic of fundamental research will require the establishment and thorough study of animal models representative of vaccine behavior in humans, or the extensive collection and curation of clinical data from the early stages following vaccination. Example of concrete projects in this area include understanding the role of M cells of different mucosal compartments in immunisation and how vaccines could utilize them [13].</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>7. mRNA vaccines... but not like everyone else does</p><p>There is a massive hype around mRNA vaccines, with good reasons, but this means that the field is currently crowded. To have an impact, individual researchers should look at original ways to apply and improve mRNA vaccines. Such approaches include using polymeric carriers instead of lipid nanoparticles to transport the mRNA, in order to decrease production costs and side effects and more easily customize vaccine properties [14]. Self-amplifying RNA vaccines represent another \u201cmarginal\u201d topic: the mRNA they use encodes not only the antigen to vaccinate against, but also a replicase which multiplies the mRNA copies in vaccinated cells, with the goal of decreasing vaccine dose and side effects while increasing antigen immunogenicity [15]. Here, a primary goal would be to shorten and optimise the replicase.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>8. Adenovirus capsid engineering</p><p>Although mRNA vaccines have monopolised the spotlight during the COVID pandemics, adenovirus-based vaccines played an equal role in combatting the pandemics [16]. This impressive track record combined with their transitory fall out of fashion suggests that bringing new people into working on them would have a substantial impact. These vectors could be used to solve many of the problems listed above [17,18]. Until now, adenovirus vaccine development mainly focused on customizing gene expression and incorporating new transgenes, while no modifications of the capsid (the proteins at the surface of the adenovirus, that are the main vaccine component to interact with the immune system and thus determine vaccine efficiency) have been tested for vaccines until 2022 [19]. The fledgling research topic of vaccine vector capsid engineering could therefore be the new frontier that will bring about major vaccine improvements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>Other areas where motivated and skilled workforce can make a difference:</h3><ol><li>Gene drives</li></ol><p>Many pathogens of both humans, farm animals and crops are transmitted by insects. Gene drives consist in genetically modifying wild insect populations to make them collapse or become incapable of transmitting the disease, thanks to genetic constructs (usually based on CRISPR-Cas9) that can be transmitted to all the progeny of GMO insects instead of just half of it as is the case for natural inheritance. This facilitates the propagation of the sterilizing or resistance-providing gene to whole insect populations starting from a limited number of insects modified in laboratory [20]. Gene drives are already quite famous in the EA community thanks to the works of Kevin Esvelt and hold a huge potential, but are unpopular with many voters and politicians due to fears (to some extent justified) of misuse and lack of control on this technology. It is therefore not clear how much of this potential will have even a chance to turn concrete. However, very promising news have recently been published about less controversial versions of gene drives, where mosquitoes were infected with Wolbachia bacteria so that they lose the ability to transmit dengue. Real world trials in Indonesia, Colombia and Brazil resulted in 77-97% decreases in dengue incidence sustained over several years [21,22].</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>2. Entomology</p><p>Since so many diseases are transmitted by insects, studying them is key to understand how to improve human health, but this discipline is relatively unpopular among biology students while there is an increasingly dire shortage of medical entomologists [23,24].</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>3. Gene therapy</p><p>Gene therapy has been a more innovative area than vaccinology, despite having in itself a much lower scope due to the rarity of targeted diseases. Many of the technologies recently adopted in vaccinology were invented in a gene therapy context, for example the mRNA and adenovirus vector vaccines that have been at the forefront of the fight against the COVID pandemics.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>4. Clinical trials regulations and public health policy</p><p>Without massive public sector investments and preparation in advance of fast-track priority clinical trial protocols, it could have taken a decade instead of a year until COVID vaccines were approved by regulatory agencies. This illustrates that governments have a critical role to play in accelerating vaccine innovation and development, and especially that adapted incentives and clinical trials protocols can be adapted to any health threat to decrease clinical trials costs and duration without sacrificing anything in safety [25]. In order to adapt to the specificities of new treatments that keep being developed and to solve the limitations identified during the COVID pandemics, there is still a lot of work to do in this area, not only on vaccines but also with other priority treatments, for example those contributing to the fight against AMR.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>5. CEPI, Wellcome trust and Gates fundation</p><p>Let\u2019s keep focused on administration and policy careers. The coalition for epidemic preparedness innovations (CEPI) is a consortium aiming at advising national agencies and coordinating international support, and at funding for research on vaccines for emerging diseases. One of its main activities is the \u201c100 days initiative\u201d whose aim is to decrease the time between epidemic start and vaccine approval to just 100 days (compared to almost one year in the case of COVID). This approach involves among others prior validation of quickly adaptable vaccine platforms (such as mRNA or adenovirus vaccines where only the antigen needs to be changed when a new pathogen is discovered and manufacture is already established), drilling of action plans and maintenance of alertness state, modelisation to try and predict which vaccine designs have the best chances of protecting against potential future pathogens, and building facility networks to enable scientists to quickly access all the materials and expertise they need when designing and testing new treatments in the face of an emerging epidemic. CEPI is also advocating for human challenge trials, in which volunteers would be infected with the pathogen following vaccination in order to know very early if candidate vaccines are efficient and to gather data on how to improve them if needed.</p><p>Likewise, the Wellcome trust and Gates fundation are major funders of medical developments (vaccine and others) trying to maximise positive impact and therefore often financing research in areas neglected by big pharmaceutical companies due to lack of expected economic returns.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>6. Applying AI to vaccine development and deployment</p><p>In January 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 genome was sequenced and published on the internet with largely automated processes, following which it took only a few days before numerous candidate vaccines had been designed using well-known methods. We are not that far from completely automatizing the whole process from pathogen discovery to vaccine design, production and manufacture at scale in biofactories, and automatization could help further shorten the deployment timetable.</p><p>Furthermore, better prediction tools could help forecast pathogens immune escape mutations and prepare countermeasures, or find out how to best modify vaccine components, or even decide how to prioritize clinical trials based on intermediary results in order to respond faster to current or future pandemics. Data-driven approaches are already to a large extent able to design proteins that best activate immune responses, thanks to huge datasets already generated in <i>in vitro</i> and clinical studies and curated; however, more experimental data would have to be generated before models can be trained on numerous other questions, for example how vaccine vector surface modifications would modify transduction levels, antigen expression and immunogenicity.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>7. Veterinary medicine</p><p>The current fashionable word in WHO and other health agencies is \u201cone health\u201d: human health partly depends on the health of animals that we rely on for farming and more and that can transmit us new pathogens. The current avian flu epizooty, which is frequently crossing species barriers including toward wild mammals in South America in 2023, may end up causing human outbreaks, highlighting the need for poultry universal flu vaccines [26].</p><p>In addition, veterinary treatments can be tested faster and at lower cost than human treatments due to less strict safety rules and the possibility to challenge vaccinated animals with the pathogen to know fast and with only a small number of animals if the treatment is efficient. Veterinary medicine thus offers an avenue for the testing of innovative vaccine technology and provides pharmaceutical companies with quick economic profits that can help fund human clinical trials, thus making them less risk-averse.</p><h3><br>Conclusion</h3><p>I hope this report helped you to get a better understanding of the current biomedicine research field or to identify the topics where you can best contribute given your personal preferences and skillset. To learn more on this subject, you may have a look at the references below or even register at a dedicated course, for example one of the vaccine network courses: <a href=\"http://www.icavt.org/\"><u>www.icavt.org</u></a>.</p><p>Finally, several promising vaccine initiatives can be funded by private individuals, for example through the CEPI fund. The most impactful charity to donate to is probably GAVI (<a href=\"https://www.gavi.org/donate\"><u>https://www.gavi.org/donate</u></a>), a consortium funding the delivery of vaccines to poor and isolated regions where they are most needed. Active since 2000, it is estimated that GAVI already saved at least 9 million lives [27].</p><h3><br>References</h3><p>[1] <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death\"><u>https://ourworldindata.org/causes-of-death</u></a> mortality of infectious diseases is indicated to be 14%, but this was data from before COVID-19 and several of the diseases registered as \u201cnoncommunicable\u201d are triggered or worsened by pathogens (hepatitis viruses for cirrhosis, papillomavirus for cancer, rhinovirus for asthma...) so at least 2 or 3 million deaths can be added to the current burden of infectious diseases.</p><p>[2] <a href=\"https://legrandcontinent.eu/fr/2023/04/26/10-points-sur-lantibioresistance/\"><u>https://legrandcontinent.eu/fr/2023/04/26/10-points-sur-lantibioresistance/</u></a></p><p>[3] https://www.who.int/teams/immunization-vaccines-and-biologicals/diseases</p><p>[4] <a href=\"https://www.who.int/news/item/02-10-2023-who-recommends-r21-matrix-m-vaccine-for-malaria-prevention-in-updated-advice-on-immunization\"><u>https://www.who.int/news/item/02-10-2023-who-recommends-r21-matrix-m-vaccine-for-malaria-prevention-in-updated-advice-on-immunization</u></a></p><p>[5] <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/W93Pt7xch7eyrkZ7f/cause-area-report-antimicrobial-resistance\"><u>https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/W93Pt7xch7eyrkZ7f/cause-area-report-antimicrobial-resistance</u></a></p><p>[6] Shukla et al., bioRxiv, 2023. <a href=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.15.540765v1\"><u>https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.05.15.540765v1</u></a></p><p>[7] Tsai et al., Expert review of vaccines, 2023. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2023.2268724\"><u>https://doi.org/10.1080/14760584.2023.2268724</u></a></p><p>[8] Zhu et al., Vaccines, 2021. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01707-21\"><u>https://doi.org/10.1128/mbio.01707-21</u></a></p><p>[9] Cohen et al., Science, 2022. <a href=\"https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abq0839\"><u>https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.abq0839</u></a></p><p>[10] Svitlana Kondovych, Life Chemicals, 2021</p><p>[11] <a href=\"https://news.mit.edu/2023/vaccine-printer-could-help-vaccines-reach-more-people-0424\"><u>https://news.mit.edu/2023/vaccine-printer-could-help-vaccines-reach-more-people-0424</u></a></p><p>[12] Braun et al., Cur Op in Immu, 2023. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coi.2023.102374\"><u>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coi.2023.102374</u></a></p><p>[13] Islam et al., Biomaterials, 2019. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.10.041\">https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biomaterials.2018.10.041</a></p><p>[14] Yang et al., Advanced Healthcare Materials, 2023. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202202688\"><u>https://doi.org/10.1002/adhm.202202688</u></a></p><p>[15] Pourcel et al., Drug Discovery Today, 2022. <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2022.103341\"><u>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.drudis.2022.103341</u></a></p><p>[16] Watson et al., Lancet Infect Dis, 23<sup>rd</sup> June 2022.</p><p>[17] Afkhami et al., Molecular Therapy - Meth. &amp; Clin.

They sounded plausible, but at the same time I thought I should account for the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/inside-vs-outside-view\"><u>outside view</u></a>, which I knew did not favour terrorism being a global catastrophic risk. So I decided to look into historical terrorist attack deaths to estimate a prior probability for a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/terrorism\"><u>terrorist</u></a>&nbsp;attack causing <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/human-extinction\"><u>human extinction</u></a>.</p><h1>Methods</h1><p>Firstly, I retrieved data for the deaths in the 202 k terrorist attacks between January 1970 and June 2021 on the <a href=\"https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/\"><u>Global Terrorism Database</u></a>&nbsp;(GTB).

the probability of a terrorist attack causing human extinction is astronomically low. According to my preferred estimate, the median taken across the 10 distributions with lowest RSS fitted to the top 1 % logarithm of the terrorist attack deaths as a fraction of the global population, the annual probability of human extinction caused by a terrorist attack is 4.35*10^-15. Across all my 18 median estimates, it is 4.35*10^-15 for 2, and 0 for the other 16. For context, in the Existential Risk Persuasion Tournament (<a href=\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/635693acf15a3e2a14a56a4a/t/64f0a7838ccbf43b6b5ee40c/1693493128111/XPT.pdf\"><u>XPT</u></a>), superforecasters and domain experts<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefvd42qmablm\"><sup><a href=\"#fnvd42qmablm\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;predicted a probability of an engineered pathogen causing human extinction by 2100 of 0.01 % and 1 %, which are much higher than the implied by my prior estimates.</p><p>I do not think <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/anthropics\"><u>anthropics</u></a>&nbsp;are confounding the results. There would be no one to do this analysis if a terrorist attack had caused human extinction in the past, but there would be for less severe large scale attacks, and there have not been any. The most deadly attack since 1970 on GTB only killed 1.70 k people. As a side note, the most deadly <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_bioterrorist_incidents\"><u>bioterrorist&nbsp;incident</u></a>&nbsp;only killed 200 people (over 5 years).</p><p>Interestingly, some best fit distributions led to an annual probability of human extinction caused by a terrorist attack higher than 10 % (see last 2 graphs), which is unreasonably high. In terms of the best fit distributions to:</p><ul><li>The top 1 % terrorist attack deaths, a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-normal_distribution\"><u>lognormal</u></a> results&nbsp;in 45.1 %<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefzp1iy7rl7bs\"><sup><a href=\"#fnzp1iy7rl7bs\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(R^2 = 14.5 %).</li><li>The logarithm of the top 1 % terrorist attack deaths as a fraction of the global population (the following are ordered by descending R^2):<ul><li>A <a href=\"https://distribution-explorer.github.io/continuous/halfcauchy.html\"><u>half-Cauchy</u></a>&nbsp;results in 39.5 % (R^2 of 94.8 %).</li><li>A <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167715200000596\"><u>skew-Cauchy</u></a>&nbsp;results in 39.4 % (94.8 %).</li><li>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Log-Laplace_distribution\"><u>log-Laplace</u></a>&nbsp;results in 28.8 % (90.8 %).</li><li>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%25C3%25A9vy_distribution\"><u>L\u00e9vi</u></a>&nbsp;results in 96.2 % (77.9 %).</li><li>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noncentral_F-distribution\"><u>noncentral F-distribution</u></a>&nbsp;results in 58.0 % (77.8 %).</li><li>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_distribution\"><u>Cauchy</u></a>&nbsp;results in 15.1 % (70.7 %).</li><li>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Mises_distribution\"><u>von Mises</u></a>&nbsp;results in 100 % (66.4 %).</li><li>A <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/F-distribution\"><u>F-distribution</u></a>&nbsp;results in 66.4 % (65.5 %).</li></ul></li></ul><p>Nonetheless, I have no reason to put lots of weight into the distributions above, so I assume it makes sense to rely on the median. In addition, according to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extreme_value_theory\"><u>extreme value theory</u></a>, the right tail <a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/geomagnetic-storms-using-extreme-value-theory-to-gauge-the-risk/\"><u>should</u></a>&nbsp;follow a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalized_Pareto_distribution\"><u>generalised Pareto</u></a>, whose respective best fit to:</p><ul><li>The top 1 % terrorist&nbsp;attack deaths results in an annual probability of human extinction caused by a terrorist attack of 0 (R^2 of 94.5 %).</li><li>The logarithm of the top 1 % terrorist attack deaths as a fraction of the global population results in 0 (98.1 %).</li></ul><p>Of course, no one is arguing that terrorist attacks with the current capabilities pose a meaningful extinction risk. The claim is that the world may become <a href=\"https://nickbostrom.com/papers/vulnerable.pdf\"><u>vulnerable</u></a>&nbsp;if advances in AI and bio make super destructive technology much more widely accessible. One may well update to a much higher extinction risk after accounting for inside view factors, and indirect effects of terrorist attacks (like precipitating wars). However, extraordinary evidence&nbsp;would be required to move up sufficiently many orders of magnitude for an <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/artificial-intelligence\"><u>AI</u></a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/biosecurity-and-pandemics\"><u>bio</u></a>&nbsp;terrorist attack to have a decent chance of causing human extinction. On the other hand, extinction may be caused via other routes, like a big war or accident.</p><p>I appreciate it is often difficult to present compelling evidence for high terrorism risk due to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/information-hazard\"><u>infohazards</u></a>, even if these&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/3a6QWDhxYTz5dEMag/how-can-we-improve-infohazard-governance-in-ea-biosecurity\"><u>hinder</u></a> good epistemics. However, there are ways of quantifying terrorism risk which mitigate them. From Open Philanthropy\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xFsmibHafAu8APgiS/request-for-proposals-help-open-philanthropy-quantify\"><u>request</u></a> for proposal to quantify&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/biosecurity-and-pandemics\"><u>biorisk</u></a>:</p><blockquote><p>One way of estimating biological risk that we do not recommend is \u2018threat assessment\u2019\u2014investigating various ways that one could cause a biological catastrophe. This approach may be valuable in certain situations, but the information hazards involved make it inherently risky. In our view, the harms outweigh the benefits in most cases.</p><p>A second, less risky approach is to abstract away most biological details and instead consider general \u2018base rates\u2019. The aim is to estimate the likelihood of a biological attack or accident using historical data and base rates of analogous scenarios, and of risk factors such as warfare or terrorism.</p></blockquote><p>As far as know, there is currently no publicly available detailed model of tail biorisk. I think it would be great if Open Philanthropy published the results of their efforts to quantify biorisk if/once they are available. The request was published about 19 months ago, and the respective&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/funding-for-projects-to-estimate-biological-risk/\"><u>grants</u></a> were announced 17 months ago. Denise Melchin <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xFsmibHafAu8APgiS/request-for-proposals-help-open-philanthropy-quantify?commentId=CmEtY8eFLpnsY7pJY\">asked</a> 12 months ago whether the results would be published, but there has been no reply.</p><p>In general, I agree with David Thorstad that Toby Ord\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Z5KZ2cui8WDjyF6gJ/some-thoughts-on-toby-ord-s-existential-risk-estimates\"><u>guesses</u></a> for the existential risk between 2021 and 2120 given in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theprecipice.com/\"><u>The Precipice</u></a> are very high.

This means that for every \u20ac1 spent on&nbsp;<i>Effektiv Spenden</i> between 2019-2022, we are confident to have facilitated more than \u20ac10 to support highly effective charities which would not have materialized had&nbsp;<i>Effektiv Spenden</i> not existed.&nbsp;</li><li>Our <strong>conservative counterfactual giving multiplier is 10.4 for 2019-2021, and 7.5 for 2020-2022.&nbsp;</strong></li><li>The decline of our multiplier over time is driven by the&nbsp;<strong>investment into our team. </strong>Over the last year, our team has grown substantially to enable further growth.

That said, ultimately our goal is not to maximize the multiplier, but to maximize counterfactually raised funds for highly effective charities. (As long as our work remains above a reasonable cost-effectiveness bar.)</li></ul><h1><strong>How to interpret our results</strong></h1><p><strong>We consider our analysis an important stocktake of our impact, and a further contribution to the growing body of giving multiplier analyses in the effective giving space. That said, we also recognize the limitations of our approach and want to &nbsp;call out some caveats to guide interpretation of these results.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Our analysis is largely retrospective</strong>, i.e. it compares our past money moved with operating costs during the same. As mentioned above, current investments into future growth lower our giving multiplier, but will pay off in the medium to longer term.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>We look at average rather than marginal impact</strong>, i.e. we are dividing all donations received by all of our costs of operation. We expect our marginal cost-effectiveness to be lower as a result of diminishing returns. That said, we consider the investment into our team in 2022 a necessary step to enable further growth, i.e. with high marginal impact.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Accounting for the counterfactual is difficult. </strong>We try to account for donations to high-impact charities that would also have happened, had <i>Effektiv Spenden</i> never existed. We largely rely on post-donation surveys of our donors, but recognize that this approach has many limitations and hope to be able to further refine our approach in the future.</li><li><strong>We currently only account for our direct impact</strong>, i.e. donations received on our platform. We do not include donations towards our recommended charities that were either made directly to them or through other channels based on our recommendation. This ignores some part of our impact and thus conservatively lowers our impact multiplier. We intend to include some indirect donations in future assessments, particularly large donations that are transferred directly to the recommended charities by the donors, but that we can directly tie to the philanthropic advice we have been giving.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn6ncguhm1vdm\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref6ncguhm1vdm\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>To calculate our leverage ratio and multiplier, results are adjusted for inflation and reported in 2022-equivalent EUR.</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "Sebastian Schienle"}}, {"_id": "YzCF2NDLSwKayZXb7", "title": "ALLFED's 2023 Highlights", "postedAt": "2023-12-01T00:47:15.627Z", "htmlBody": "<h2><strong>Executive Summary&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Welcome to ALLFED\u2019s 2023 Highlights, our annual update on what Alliance to Feed the Earth in Disasters has been up to this year.

This could decimate agriculture as it is practiced today. We therefore need resilient food sources for such an event. One promising candidate is seaweed, as it can grow quickly in a wide range of environmental conditions.&nbsp;</p><p>To explore the feasibility of seaweed after nuclear war, we simulate the growth of seaweed on a global scale using an empirical model based on&nbsp;<i>Gracilaria tikvahiae</i> forced by nuclear winter climate simulations. We assess how quickly global seaweed production could be scaled to provide a significant fraction of global food demand. We find seaweed can be grown in tropical oceans, even after a near worst case nuclear winter (150 Tg (teragrams or million tons) of soot put into the stratosphere).&nbsp;</p><p>The simulated growth is high enough to allow a scale up to an equivalent of 70% of the global human food demand (spread among food, animal feed, and biofuels) in under a year, while only using a small fraction of the global ocean area. The main limiting factor being the speed in which new seaweed farms can be built. The results also show that the growth of seaweed increases with the severity of the nuclear war, as more nutrients become available due to increased vertical mixing. This means that seaweed has the potential to be a viable resilient food source for abrupt sunlight reduction scenarios.</p><p><i>[Note of acknowledgement] The authors would like to thank Scott Carlton James (Baylor University), who has recently passed away, who helped with the initial scoping of the project by running some of the ocean model data through his growth model and providing said growth model to the project.

Industrial agriculture in turn has become an increasingly complex and globally interconnected system whose historically unprecedented yield relies strongly on external energy inputs in the shape of machinery, fertilizers, and pesticides. This leaves the system vulnerable to disruptions of industrial production and international trade. Several events have the potential to damage electrical infrastructure on a global scale, including electromagnetic pulses caused by solar storms or the detonation of nuclear warheads in the upper atmosphere, a pandemic leading to a significant reluctance to attend their workplaces, as well as a globally coordinated cyber-attack.&nbsp;</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of crisis preparation and the establishment of more resilient systems. To improve preparation for high-stake risk scenarios their impact especially on critical supply systems must be better understood. To advance understanding of the implications for the global food system, this work aims to estimate the effect a global curtailment of industrial production could have on crop yields of the major staple crops: corn, rice, soybean, and wheat. We use a generalized linear model to estimate the loss in crop yield based on temperature, moisture, soil characteristics, nitrogen and pesticide application rates, the fraction of irrigated area and mechanization. The model predicts crop yields in two phases following a global catastrophe which inhibits the usage of any electric services. Phase 1 reflects conditions in the year immediately after the catastrophe, assuming the availability of fertilizer, pesticides, and fuel stocks. However, those stocks would be subject to rationed use in the first year. In phase 2, all stocks are used up and artificial fertilizer, pesticides and fuel are not available anymore. The predictions show a reduction in yield of 15 to 37 % in phase 1 and between 35 to 48 % in phase 2 depending on the crop. Actual drops would be larger because of some loss of improved crop varieties.</p><p>Soybean is least affected while wheat, rice and corn decline roughly by the same amount. Overall Europe, North and South America and large parts of India, China and Indonesia are projected to face major yield reductions of up to 95% while most African countries are scarcely affected. The findings clearly indicate hotspot regions which align with the level of industrialization of agriculture and highlight the need for preparation.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YzCF2NDLSwKayZXb7/bj4pix15fisryf9hysgz\"><figcaption><strong>Figure 3.

Recent work has found technical potential for feeding humanity during global catastrophes using leaves as stop-gap alternative foods. To determine the potential for adopting agricultural residue (especially crop leaves) as food in food-insecure areas, this study provides a new methodology to quantify the calories available from agricultural residue as alternative foods at the community scale. A case study is performed on thirteen communities in Nigeria to compare national level values to those available in rural communities. Two residue utilization cases were considered, including a pessimistic and an optimistic case for human-edible calories gained. Here, we show that between 3.0 and 13.8 million Gcal (billion calories) are available in Nigeria per year from harvesting agricultural residue as alternative food.

A promising temporary resilient food is leaf protein concentrate (LPC). Although it is possible to extract LPC from tree biomass (e.g., leaves and needles), neither the yields nor the toxicity of the protein concentrates for humans from the most common tree species has been widely investigated. To help fill this knowledge gap, this study uses high-resolution mass spectrometry and an open-source toolchain for non-targeted screening of toxins on five common North American coniferous species: Western Cedar, Douglas Fir, Ponderosa Pine, Western Hemlock, and Lodgepole Pine. The yields for LPC extraction from the conifers ranged from 1% to 7.5%. The toxicity screenings confirm that these trees may contain toxins that can be consumed in small amounts, and additional studies including measuring the quantity of each toxin are needed. The results indicate that LPC is a promising candidate to be used as resilient food, but future work is needed before LPCs from conifers can be used as a wide-scale human food.</p><p><strong>Anthropocene Under Dark Skies: The Compounding Effects of Nuclear Winter and Overstepped Planetary Boundaries</strong></p><p><i>Jehn, F.U., Anthropocene Under Dark Skies: The Compounding Effects of Nuclear Winter and Overstepped Planetary Boundaries. 2023.

Available at:&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://purl.stanford.edu/zb109mz2513\"><i><u>https://purl.stanford.edu/zb109mz2513</u></i></a><i>.</i></p><p>The analysis of global catastrophic events often occurs in isolation, simplifying their study. In reality, risks cascade and interact. Therefore, it is essential to consider the interconnected nature of global risks. This investigation explores the interplay between nuclear winter and planetary boundaries. It may seem reasonable to assume that respecting planetary boundaries, which define a safe operating space for the planet, is preferable before a nuclear war. However, that does not always seem to be the case. For instance, increased nitrogen emissions today could serve as a nutrient buffer during nuclear winter. Contrastingly, mitigating climate change, means an even larger temperature drop in nuclear winter in comparison with pre-industrial times. This exploratory study also highlights planetary boundaries that could enhance human survival if we adhere to their limits, both presently and after a nuclear war. The best example being biosphere integrity, as conserving it has no direct downsides and would make the Earth system more resilient to resist the shock of a nuclear winter.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YzCF2NDLSwKayZXb7/ifva1ajade49oyliktqv\"><figcaption><strong>Figure 6.

For 4 out of 6 of the crops, we are close to the best published correlation between global crop model yields and historical yields.</li><li><i><strong>Seaweed Deployment.</strong></i> Our research has demonstrated that seaweed will still grow in severe nuclear winter. This means that it can make an important contribution to food security, even in the worst abrupt sunlight reduction scenarios. The growth model is also open source.

Increasing geopolitical tensions have&nbsp;presented an opportunity to translate our scientific research into actionable policy.&nbsp;Policy could also result in funding for research and pilots. ALLFED has allocated an increased amount of our resources to policy engagement this year. This work stream has included delivery of knowledge products and policy proposals to governments in multiple jurisdictions.</p><p>To inform our strategic approach and ensure consistent mission-alignment across our policy engagements, we developed our first Policy component of our Theory of Change (TOC).</p><p>The iterative nature of this policy TOC component is key to strategic alliance-building, knowledge-sharing and influencing, and momentum building of global catastrophic food failure (GCFF) resilience policy globally.<strong>&nbsp;</strong>An important aspect is the push-pull dynamic to and from ALLFED\u2019s research \u2013 change-makers across our network shape and are shaped by our research strategy. ALLFED also considers the role of countries in influencing each other to take up new resilience policies, allowing us to build credibility as well as topical momentum as a global organization.</p><p>We aim to continue translating our research to policies that increase extreme food resilience through fruitful collaborations in various regions across the world \u2013 from Australia to the United States and Argentina. Among other things, we participated in the following fora this year:</p><ul><li>We were invited to the World Food Forum organized by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations. We networked with multiple government officials and other multilateral stakeholders, including the FAO leadership, and high-level members of country delegations.</li><li>We were invited to a number of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.chathamhouse.org/\"><u>Chatham House</u></a> exclusive events, presenting at a closed-doors session earlier in the year, where influential multilateral stakeholders were present. We continue building upon these relationships through continued engagement.&nbsp;</li><li>Our Norwegian policy engagement has led to team members presenting key ALLFED research to the country\u2019s emergency management agency,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/jd/organisation/underliggende-etater/directorate-for-civil-protection-and-emergency-planning/id279674/\"><u>Directorate for Civil Protection and Emergency Planning</u></a>.

We provided input on the draft legislative text for the Farm Bill, including research priorities and governance developments needed to manage food system risks from ASRS. This was part of direct collaboration on policy formulation with a Senator's office. Our approach to the Farm Bill, and strategic engagements, was informed by networking and direct consultation with various relevant stakeholders (political and non-political) in Washington DC. Our political outreach process included a balance of Democrat and Republican offices.</p><p>In addition,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/sen-markey-rep-eshoo-announce-health-security-agenda-to-investigate-risks-of-nuclear-weapons-promote-safe-use-of-gene-synthesis\"><u>ALLFED publicly endorsed a Bill from Senator Edward Markey\u2019s Office (Massachusetts</u></a>) after working to develop the final version of the Bill through expert advice.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Argentina Policy Engagement&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>ALLFED has recently partnered with the Spanish-speaking GCR science-policy organization&nbsp;<a href=\"https://riesgoscatastroficosglobales.com/\"><u>Observatorio de Riesgos Catastr\u00f3ficos Globales</u></a> to create a landmark report on how to shield Argentina against the most extreme global food catastrophes, involving the loss of sunlight collapsing agriculture globally (e.g. volcanic or nuclear winter).

The report contains 8 main recommendations, divided into communication and food supply, and food production and redirection in the event of an ASRS, including redirection of feed for livestock and biofuel, adoption of cold and drought tolerant crops, construction of greenhouses, and increase of cultivated areas. As priority actions for effective implementation, we recommend the creation of government contingency plans and the creation of an interdepartmental task force to address the risk.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"table\"><table><tbody><tr><td style=\"border:1pt solid #000000;padding:5pt;vertical-align:top\"><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YzCF2NDLSwKayZXb7/bwq8l5itmocexj4ii9ot\"><figcaption><strong>Figure 10.

Greg's work in Canberra secured meetings with key government stakeholders responsible for national emergency response, including nuclear scenarios.</p><p>The ALLFED research team authored the report entitled Australia Abrupt Sunlight Reduction Scenario (ASRS) Response Plan, offering strategies to maintain food security after a catastrophic sunlight disruption. As part of a focused engagement strategy with public servants rather than elected officials, we traveled to Canberra to present these recommendations directly to government teams managing such scenarios. Early indications suggest this may be a successful approach - we secured high-level meetings with relative ease. This work is particularly valuable for ALLFED\u2019s mission, as Australia is uniquely positioned to not only survive but also potentially increase regional food production and feed the Asia Pacific in a nuclear winter (<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/risa.14123\"><u>Boyd &amp; Wilson, 2023</u></a>). We are now confident that in the event of a nuclear winter, the Australian government will have access to our response plan.</p><p>ALLFED Australia pursued&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nema.gov.au/disaster-ready-fund\"><u>Disaster Ready Fund (DRF)</u></a> proposals, meeting with state emergency agencies and a major paper company about cellulosic sugar production. We also scoped potential single cell protein (SCP) pilots with an SCP company and an energy provider. Given the Fund's scope, we pivoted to focus on building government capacity.&nbsp;Our proposal made it as far as the final selection round, and it was recommended that we apply for the next one. Other takeaways from this endeavor included securing support, gaining valuable insights, and connecting with potential future collaborators.&nbsp;</p><p>Additionally, ALLFED Australia made multiple submissions responding to parliamentary calls advocating for crisis readiness policies that support global food security.&nbsp;</p><p>Moving forward, we aim to continue collaborating with key government departments, industry, academia, and other aligned organizations as well as pursue new opportunities including the second round of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://nema.gov.au/disaster-ready-fund\"><u>Disaster Ready Fund (DRF)</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YzCF2NDLSwKayZXb7/ja89lzykyo47kv9jbzqn\"><figcaption><strong>Figure 11.

Over 50 attendees participated in the desktop exercise.</strong></figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Operations</strong></h2><p>2023 has been an extremely busy year for ALLFED\u2019s operations team.&nbsp; There are now 2 ALLFED charitable entities, ops resilience and response-related work has been embedded into ALLFED\u2019s top-level Theory of Change,&nbsp;and our organizational capacity has been significantly boosted by numerous improvements across all areas of operations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>ALLFED\u2019s&nbsp; 2 Charitable Entities&nbsp;</strong></h3><p>There have been a number of key developments from the organizational structure perspective, most importantly, our first full year of operating as an independent 501(c)(3) charity in the USA as well as successfully securing charity status in the UK (see<a href=\"https://allfed.info/allfeduk\"><u> here</u></a> for more information on how both charitable entities compare).</p><h3><strong>Internal Resilience, Response, and Capacity-Building</strong></h3><p>ALLFED\u2019s operations team have been gratified to see \u201cinternal resilience, response, and capacity-building\u201d formally incorporated into ALLFED\u2019s Theory of Change this year, as one of the key modalities through which to affect change in the pursuance of ALLFED\u2019s mission.&nbsp;</p><p>We have actively pursued this for some time as per the March 2022 post by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://allfed.info/about/team-and-board?view=article&amp;id=16&amp;catid=10\">Sonia Cassidy</a>, ALLFED\u2019s Director of Operations (and also Director of Communications), which featured&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/iW7LjvuSmDEGF5nei/ea-resilience-to-catastrophes-and-allfed-s-case-study\"><u>a case study of ALLFED\u2019s organizational response</u></a> to the Russian invasion of Ukraine (it also tackled broader matters of resilience of the EA community as such).&nbsp; In 2023, we further boosted ALLFED\u2019s organizational resilience to help towards the actual availability of our team in the event of a catastrophe so that we remain contactable and able to share our research with the world. This varied from more robust crisis communications cascades to looking into the resilience of our website and other key informational infrastructure.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Process and Systems Improvements</strong><br>We have revised most of ALLFED\u2019s underlying processes and systems across all areas of operations. From IT security to financial compliance to programs/fundraising/overhead ratios, we have looked at what it is that we can do to further improve our organizational efficiency and effectiveness.&nbsp; Some of the key areas of such work we have featured below.</p><p><strong>OKRs and KPIs</strong></p><p>We have designed our organizational Objectives and Key Results (OKRs) to dovetail into individual Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). This has enhanced alignment across different teams, improving transparency in progress tracking and fostering a culture of transparency accountability.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Project Coordination Framework&nbsp;</strong></p><p>To facilitate knowledge management and organizational learning we have experimented with the Triple Loop Learning Framework into our Project Management Frameworks. This allows us to not only to identify areas for organizational improvement but also to identify opportunities for individual growth.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CRM Implementation</strong></p><p>In 2023, we have continued a key CRM system implementation (started last year) further improving how we collect, store and manage ALLFED\u2019s connections and relationship data. Here are some examples that may be of interest:</p><ul><li>Crisis communications cascades, relevant to the aforementioned ALLFED\u2019s response and resilience (whereby any team member can be put through at any time to a senior member of ALLFED\u2019s communications and/or management team).&nbsp;</li><li>HR workflows and automations (whereby much training, compliance and contracts-related work has been lifted off the shoulders of our HR coordinator and is now done by the CRM system).</li><li>Improvements to recruitment, and specifically further locking down blind recruitment protocols (whereby personal data of applicants interested in working with us is now kept&nbsp; entirely separate in the CRM system while the content relevant to their actual application or the performance of any work tasks are the only elements that our recruiters receive for their review).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ul><p><strong>GDPR and Data Management</strong></p><p>In our digital age, data management is important to any organization and mission-critical to a fully remote one. To this end, we engage in data compliance and management work on an ongoing basis, with all team members regularly receiving training on new developments and participating in keeping our data in good order.&nbsp;</p><p>One significant development on this front has been adoption of the European GDPR personal data standard across the entirety of ALLFED\u2019s operations. Although the global privacy regulation landscape is currently in flux, it is generally accepted that the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) law is at this time the most extensive legal provision for the protection of personal data. While it normally applies to the protection of EU citizens, we have adopted it globally at ALLFED to simplify data transfers across jurisdictions.&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>Our Team&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>We love it that we have team members on every continent except Antarctica (we feel we have by now nailed working across time zones and have, in fact, sometimes turned this to our advantage). We love the various cultural backgrounds we now have on our team (we would very much like to encourage more diversity still). And we love that when we do get together, people who may have never before met in person do indeed feel like we are one team.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YzCF2NDLSwKayZXb7/jm1w0d0eyx7s6qmtcf1k\"><figcaption><strong>Figure 17.

Using a very dodgy methodology that relies far too much on ChatGPT, I examined a set of historical social change events and movements and identified their primary and secondary approaches to social change. A qualitative evaluation was carried out (using ChatGPT again) to gauge the success of these examples based on a pre-defined criterion. While the most frequently observed strategies were Social Movement Support (SMS) and Field Building (FB), the findings are preliminary and should be interpreted with extreme caution. They offer a starting point for EA to consider how to approach its social change initiatives. My hope is that this poor piece of research inspires someone to do it properly.</p><h1>Introduction</h1><p>This post offers a preliminary analysis of historical case studies of social change to inform EA community building strategy.&nbsp;<br><br>In a <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Cve3s6C5kxow6ScQQ/what-we-talk-about-when-we-talk-about-community-building#Summary\">previous post</a>, I described EA, broadly speaking, as an attempt at social change, and I suggested we need to think carefully about how we allocate our 'social change portfolio' between the following approaches:</p><ul><li>Social movement support</li><li>Field building</li><li>Network development</li><li>Promoting the uptake of practices by organisations&nbsp;</li></ul><p>In this post, I attempt to inform this thinking by looking at a set of historical case studies and analysing how their social change portfolios were allocated. I did this using ChatGPT.&nbsp;</p><h1>Four approaches to social change</h1><p>As discussed in my previous post, there are four primary approaches to social change:</p><ol><li><strong>Social Movement Support (SMS)</strong>: Focuses on grassroots mobilisation and public campaigns.</li><li><strong>Field Building (FB)</strong>: Aims to create an academic or intellectual foundation for the movement.</li><li><strong>Network Development (ND)</strong>: Involves building relationships with other organisations, academics, and policymakers.</li><li><strong>Promoting the Uptake of Practices by Organizations (PUPO)</strong>: Focuses on influencing policies, regulations, and practices within existing organisations.</li></ol><h1>Historical Examples and Approaches Employed</h1><p>Mark Lutter,

The aim is to inform EA community building strategy by understanding the strategies employed by successful social change movements. In this discussion, I delve into the implications of the findings, their relevance to EA, and acknowledge the study's limitations.</p><h2><strong>Strategy allocation in successful social change</strong></h2><p>The analysis suggests that Social Movement Support (SMS) and Field Building (FB) are the most frequently employed strategies in successful historical examples of social change. This finding implies that grassroots mobilisation, public campaigns, and the establishment of intellectual foundations are key drivers of successful social change efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>Field Building's prominence among successful cases underscores the importance of establishing a rigorous intellectual foundation for a movement. This approach helps provide coherence, mobilise intellectuals, and leave a lasting impact on policies and societal norms.</p><h2><strong>Network development and promoting the uptake of practices by organisations</strong></h2><p>The analysis suggests that Network Development (ND) and Promoting the Uptake of Practices by Organizations (PUPO) were less frequently observed in successful social change initiatives. ND was employed in only 11% of successful cases, while PUPO was used in approximately 22% of them. This indicates that, while these strategies play a role in social change, they may be less central to achieving broad and lasting impact compared to SMS and FB.</p><p>The lower frequency of ND may be attributed to the historical context of many of these cases, where grassroots movements and ideological shifts played a more pivotal role. However, it's important to acknowledge that ND can be crucial in building alliances, securing resources, and gaining political influence in contemporary social change efforts.</p><p>The moderate presence of PUPO among successful cases highlights the significance of influencing policies, regulations, and practices within existing organisations. In cases like Progressivism and Environmentalism, influencing the practices of organizations and institutions has led to significant, lasting changes in society.</p><h2><strong>The relationship between social change 'success' and the portfolios employed</strong></h2><p>The definition of success used in this analysis, involving a 15% change in behaviour or beliefs occurring in more than 25% of the population with consequences persisting for at least 10 years, provides a structured framework for evaluating the impact of social change initiatives. However, it is essential to recognise that this definition may not capture all aspects of success, especially in cases where long-term consequences are harder to measure or where shifts in behaviour and beliefs are gradual.</p><p>The qualitative assessments of success for historical examples add depth to the analysis but introduce subjectivity. Applying a uniform criterion to vastly different historical contexts can be challenging, and there may be cases where the interpretation of success varies. Nevertheless, these assessments provide an initial step towards evaluating the effectiveness of social change strategies.</p><h2>Limitations</h2><ol><li>I am not a researcher and I have no idea what I'm doing.</li><li>ChatGPT is very unreliable and I haven't checked anything.</li><li>This is a weird dataset.</li><li>This is a very basic methodology and it is probably fundamentally flawed.</li><li>Maybe ChatGPT misinterpreted my definition of success. I would argue neoliberalism counts as a success using my criterion, but ChatGPT seemed to disagree.</li></ol><h1>Conclusion</h1><p>The analysis provides some preliminary indications that strategy selection may play a role in the efficacy of social change initiatives. While Social Movement Support (SMS) and Field Building (FB) appeared more frequently in what were qualitatively assessed as successful cases, it's important to exercise caution in drawing firm conclusions. This is a very scrappy way of trying to answer this question, implemented by someone who doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing. For EA, these findings could serve as an initial step in thinking more deeply about how to allocate resources across different strategies. For me, it is a point of evidence in favour of keeping the social movement part of EA strong. However, more rigorous research done by someone who actually knows what they're doing is needed to substantiate these early observations and tailor them to the specific goals and challenges that EA aims to address. Please, someone do this for me.</p>", "user": {"username": "James Herbert"}}, {"_id": "fGCHomw45xuTHd757", "title": "An exhaustive list of cosmic threats", "postedAt": "2023-12-04T17:59:24.871Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Toby Ord covers 'Asteroids and Comets' and 'Stellar Explosions' in The Precipice. But I thought it would be useful to provide an up-to-date and exhaustive list of all cosmic threats. I'm defining cosmic threat here as any existential risk potentially arising from space. I think this list may be useful for 3 main reasons:</p><ol><li>New cosmic threats are discovered frequently. So it's plausible that future cause areas could pop out of this space. I think that keeping an eye on it should help identify areas that may need research. Though it should be noted that some of the risks are totally impossible to protect against at this point (e.g. a rogue planet entering our solar system).</li><li>Putting all of the cosmic threats together in one place could reveal that cosmic threats are more important than previously thought, or provide a good intro for someone interested in working in this <i>space</i>.&nbsp;</li><li>There is momentum in existential risk reduction from outer space, with great powers (<a href=\"https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/smpag/smpag_members\">Russia, USA, China, India, Europe</a>) already <a href=\"https://www.cosmos.esa.int/web/smpag/meeting-21-oct-2023-\">collaborating on asteroid impact risk</a>. So harnessing that momentum to tackle some more of the risks on this list could be really tractable and may lead to collaboration on other x-risks like AI, biotech and nuclear.&nbsp;</li></ol><p>I will list each cosmic threat, provide a brief explanation, and find the best evidence I can to provide severity and probability estimates for each. Enjoy :)</p><p>I'll use this format:</p><p><strong>Cosmic Threat </strong>[<strong>Severity of worst case scenario /10</strong>] [<strong>Probability of a scenario as bad as that occurring in the next 100 years</strong>]<strong> </strong><i>Explanation of threat</i></p><h2>Explanation of rationale and approach</h2><h3>Severity estimates</h3><p>For the severity, 10 is the extinction of all intelligent life on Earth, and 0 is a fart in the wind. It was difficult to pin down one number for threats with multiple outcomes (e.g. asteroids have different sizes). So the severity estimates are for the worst-case scenarios for each cosmic threat, and the probability estimate corresponds to an event occurring that is as severe as that scenario.&nbsp;</p><h3>Probability estimates</h3><p>Probabilities are presented as % chance of a worst case scenario-type event occurring in the next 100 years. I have taken probabilities from the literature and converted values to normalise them as a probability of their occurrence within the next 100 years (as a %). This isn't a perfect way to do it, but I prioritised getting a general understanding of their probability, rather than numbers that are hard to imagine. When the severity or likelihood is unclear or not researched well enough, I've written 'unknown'.</p><p>I'm trying my best to ignore reasoning along the lines of \"if it hasn't happened before, then it very likely won't happen ever or is extremely rare\" because of the anthropic principle. Our view of past events on Earth is biased towards a world that has allowed humanity to evolve, which likely required a few billion years of stable-ish conditions. So it is likely that we have just been lucky in the past, where no cosmic threats have disturbed Earth's habitability so extremely as to set back life's evolution by billions of years (not even the worst mass extinction ever at the Permian-Triassic boundary did this, as reptiles survived).&nbsp;</p><h2>An Exhaustive List of Cosmic Threats</h2><p>Format:&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Cosmic Threat </strong>[<strong>Severity of worst case scenario /10</strong>] [<strong>Probability of a scenario as bad as that occurring in the next 100 years</strong>]<strong> </strong><i>Explanation of threat</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Solar flares</strong> [<strong>4/10</strong>] [<a href=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2011SW000734\"><strong>1%</strong></a>]. <i>Electromagnetic radiation erupts from the surface of the sun.
