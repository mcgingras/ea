The EA Forum doesn\u2019t have these and this make it hard to filter for what you\u2019re looking for.</p>\n<p>On Facebook on the other hand, there are <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/effectivegroups\">hundreds of groups</a> based around different cause areas, local groups and organisations, and subpopulations. Here it\u2019s also hard to start rigorous discussions around certain topics because many groups are inactive and moderated poorly.</p>\n<p>Then there are lots of other small communication platforms launched by organisations that range in their accessibility, quality standards, and moderation. It all kind of works but it\u2019s messy and hard to sort through. </p>\n<p><em>It\u2019s hard to start productive conversations on specialised niche topics with international people because</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>1) Relevant people won\u2019t find you easily within the mass of posts </p>\n</li>\n<li><p>2) You\u2019ll contribute to that mass and thus distract everyone else. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Perhaps this a reason why some posts on specific topics only get a few comments even though the quality of the insights and writing seems high. </p>\n<p><em>Examples of posts that we\u2019re missing out on now:</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Local group organiser Kate tried X career workshop format X times and found that it underperformed other formats</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Private donor Bob dug into the documents of start-up vaccination charity X and wants to share preliminary findings with other donors in the global poverty space</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Machine learning student Jenna would like to ask some specific questions on how the deep reinforcement learning algorithm of AlphaGo functions</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The leader of animal welfare advocacy org X would like to share some local engagement statistics on vegan flyering, 3D headset demos, before sending them off in a more polished form to ACE. </p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Interested in any other examples you have. :-)</p>\n<p><em>What to do about it?</em></p>\n<p>I don\u2019t have any clear solutions in mind for this (perhaps this could be made a key focus in the transition to using the forum architecture of LessWrong 2.0). Just want to plant a flag here that given how much the community has grown vs. 3 years ago, people should start specialising more in the work they do, and that our current platforms are woefully behind for facilitating discussions around that. </p>\n<p>It would be impossible for one forum to handle all this adequately and it seems useful for people to experiment with different interfaces, communication processes and guidelines. Nevertheless, our current state seems far from optimal.  I think some people should consider tracking down and paying for additional thoughtful, capable web developers to adjust the forum to our changing needs.</p>\n<p>UPDATE: \nAfter reading @John Maxwell IV's comments below, I've changed my mind from a naive 'we should overhaul the entire system' view to 'we should <a href=\"https://www.edge.org/conversation/nassim_nicholas_taleb-understanding-is-a-poor-substitute-for-convexity-antifragility\">tinker</a> with it in ways we expect would facilitate better interactions, and then see if they actually do' view.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "remmelt"}}, {"_id": "kR86QM5zghSbDeBmx", "postedAt": "2018-07-08T23:25:32.070Z", "postId": "6DPSFPoQXrXrjSvgS", "htmlBody": "<p>It seems that what we need in this forum is categories/subforums.

Impact investing is a space that can give similar risk-adjusted market returns as traditional investments, but also provides social utility.</p>\n<p>In my research, I've found several factors that make me excited about this area:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Impact investing is about 5% the size of charitable donations (22B vs 410B in 2016), and is growing much faster (17% vs 4% annually)</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Impact investing makes up only 0.16% of the total capital markets - huge room for growth</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Philanthropic enterprises with sustainable business models can use existing capital markets to get funded on a large scale</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Due to the market's current inability to accurately value the 'social utility' provided, there are many greatly under-valued investment opportunities, providing similar social utility as comparable charities</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I've got more detail, logic and sources in the full post, but in the mean time, I'll tell you about one example opportunity that I've zoomed-in on.</p>\n<p>WorldTree is a company that lets you buy an acre of fast-growing Empress Splendor trees.

This investment could return a 23% annual return, while the Cool Earth 'investment' would be a loss of 100%.  At it's surface, this example does look quite promising when counting both the social utility generated, and the future utility my $20k could do in 10 years time.</p>\n<p>Looking forward to posting a more detailed write-up on the space once I'm able, and to hearing your feedback on these ideas!</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Naryan"}}, {"_id": "ipDLXrKzt2HMkBRYT", "postedAt": "2018-07-10T01:53:37.256Z", "postId": "6DPSFPoQXrXrjSvgS", "htmlBody": "<p>I'm a huge fan of this concept.

If consumers wasted less food, they would purchase less meat/eggs/dairy, which would lead to fewer animals suffering on factory farms. </p>\n<p>One factor that could be driving food waste is confusing date labeling. For example, an egg container may have a 'Sell By' date meant to help retailers manage their inventory, but a consumer who sees the label and date some time after purchasing might throw the eggs away thinking they are no longer safe to eat. One possible solution is a federal labeling law that limits producers to listing the freshness date and the expiration date (and requires them to use specific easy to understand phrases when listing either). However, there are several reasons that working towards such a law may be a bad use of resources. First, legal change may be unnecessary as <a href=\"https://www.newfoodmagazine.com/news/36825/new-labels-should-reduce-food-waste/\">it appears</a> the food industry may voluntarily adopt such a system. Second, it's unclear how much labeling reform reduces food waste (I was unable to find any studies in my brief search). Third, it may be that the primary benefits of reducing animal product consumption are the long term effects, in which case reductions in consumption driven by factors other than concern for animals may be much less impactful. Of course, there may also be other ways to reduce food waste (to which the first two concerns would not apply). </p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "RandomEA"}}, {"_id": "twy2P3YNjLabk65MM", "postedAt": "2018-07-13T02:20:50.616Z", "postId": "6DPSFPoQXrXrjSvgS", "htmlBody": "<p>Vox <a href=\"https://startup.jobs/241248-staff-writer-vox-at-voxmedia\">is looking for EA journalists</a>.

They can extended the life of some products by up to 9 days when compared to conventional packaging.</li>\n<li>Getting rid of \u2018buy one get one free\u2019 promotions at groceries</li>\n<li>Helping with redistribution of surplus food</li>\n</ul>\n<p>It can be complicated though. For example, it's possible some people don\u2019t by eggs because they look at the \u201cSell by\u201d date and think that they will expire soon.</p>\n<p>I wonder what could be next steps to increase the probability that someone looks into this. It could be added to <a href=\"http://effectivethesis.com/\">http://effectivethesis.com/</a> but that would have a low probability of changing anything. EA Animal Welfare Fund may want to fund such research if there was someone to do it, but a more concrete topic would be needed. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": "rD6ZXDR3Q4du4f56H", "user": {"username": "saulius"}}, {"_id": "GykgxqvFNQercwPzv", "postedAt": "2018-07-17T10:32:57.474Z", "postId": "6DPSFPoQXrXrjSvgS", "htmlBody": "<p>Hmm, would you think Schelling points would still be destroyed if it was just clearer where people could meet to discuss certain specific topics besides a  \u2018common space\u2019 where people could post on topics that are relevant to many people?</p>\n<p>I find the comment you link to really insightful but I doubt whether it neatly applies here.

I've really come to accept learning as a never ending process and it's liberating to look at learning that way. </p>\n<p>I'm hoping to earn some Karma points so I can make my own posts here and interact with members of this lovely forum, to continuously learn and maybe contribute sometimes along the way.</p>\n<p>I've totally bought into the concepts of effective altruism, with the ideals of working as a community to edge closer to a better society resonating with me. I'm so excited about EA that I've decided that I want to help host an Effective Altruism Global X in my home country, Bangladesh.</p>\n<p>I know for a fact that not many people know about effective altruism in Bangladesh. I've seen there is a listed group from Bangladesh in Effective Altruism Hub and I've mailed them to get in touch, but I have not detected much activity from them prior to sending them an email.</p>\n<p>I just feel that concepts such as &quot;Earning To Give&quot; and &quot;Cause Neutrality&quot; are ideas that more people should know about. So many people do not fully understand the potential for impact each individual holds, they underestimate their potential to do good and do not invest their time in finding out what they can do with their career to have more impact. So many incredibly intelligent people, due to lack of information that could have been easily available, prematurely decide that earning money is the best they can do with their lives. </p>\n<p>I absolutely believe that coming across 80,000 Hours was one of the luckiest moments in my life. The way they use scientific evidence to make a person understand the sheer capacity in one's hands, whether through donating effectively, advocacy, or direct work as explained in parts 2 and 3 of the career guide, inspires people to go out there and dedicate their lives to learning and doing good better. </p>\n<p>Bangladesh, a lower-middle income country, is an area that desperately needs more effective altruists. Also derived from the career guide, in identifying proper problem areas, they should be large enough in scale, neglected, and solvable. Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh, is the most overcrowded city in the world according to a 2017 post by the Telegraph, and 5th in the world in population density according to Wikipedia. Dhaka is a regular in the Economist Intelligence Unit's annual rankings of the &quot;Least Liveable Cities&quot; in the world. Dhaka came 2nd in 2014. Whether the misfortune of the people of Bangladesh is due to a weak government, swayed by corruption, or a lack of unity by the people, one thing is clear, that spreading the ideals of effective altruism has potential for massive impact in Bangladesh. The facts are that even if an effective altruist group exists in Dhaka, they have not been active and there is a huge opportunity to turn some heads and galvanize the doers of the society with the effective altruism movement, so that we can stride towards the development of our society that has been overdue now. </p>\n<p>I'm very excited to meet more wonderful people, and learn many new things. It keeps me awake at night to think of what a success an effective altruist community fostered in Bangladesh could prove to be. I have not yet applied to be an organizer, because I thought I should maybe get at least a little bit involved with the community. </p>\n<p>Lots of things to look forward to, and that is always how life should be.</p>\n<p>Love,</p>\n<p>Farhan</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Farhan"}}, {"_id": "gYjxJQR72RJXE7GYM", "postedAt": "2018-07-22T21:55:09.891Z", "postId": "6DPSFPoQXrXrjSvgS", "htmlBody": "<p>This is really sweet to hear. :) I wish you the best and hope you find a lot in the effective altruism community.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "eksBvp6iv3ib25EhL", "user": {"username": "Peter_Hurford"}}, {"_id": "SDJuLxJkeiRhmvkbf", "postedAt": "2018-07-24T20:04:19.318Z", "postId": "6DPSFPoQXrXrjSvgS", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>I was terrified of pursuing an EA career</strong></p>\n<p>For 3 years after joining EA I was still set on going to medical school.

However, such bias is sensitive to framing effects: people usually prefer sure gains and uncertain losses. So, I was trying to find out, without success, if anyone had reframed this decision as matter of losses, to see if one prefers, e.g., (A\u2019) reducing deaths by malaria from 478,001 to 478,000 or (B\u2019) reducing the odds of extinction (minus 10^20 lives) in 10^-10.</p><p>Perhaps there\u2019s a better way to reframe this choice, but I\u2019m not interested in discussing one particular example (however, I\u2019m concerned with the possibility that there\u2019s no bias-free way of framing it).
