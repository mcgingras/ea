I don't think so. While there is no evidence of an imminent attack, it is abundantly clear that the Chinese government would like to have the <i>option </i>of a successful attack <i>at will,&nbsp;</i> to strike at the most politically convenient time. Anyone who examines cross-strait relations from the perspective of imminence (i.e. is there going to be an attack this week, next month or next year) is mistaken in perspective. It could be five years, ten years, or 50 years. Or it could be a random soldier firing shots next week and dragging the whole world into a world war. Effective guarding against nuclear risks does not occur with an accurate expected risk timeline (impossible given the extreme opaqueness of information and randomness of war events). Instead, it happens with constant, careful, vigilant guarding. Of course, we should avoid having the US government kick-starting a nuclear war by pre-emptive strikes or panic-induced miscalculations, but that is different from saying, 'China won't bomb TW next week so let's calm down'. I don't think this is the right sentiment here.&nbsp;</p>", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "liu_he"}}, {"_id": "K7ptrJerBxqdhGmwS", "postedAt": "2022-12-15T18:07:03.341Z", "postId": "A8BEFGKtCEWcq7mJ6", "htmlBody": "<p>To my mind, the piece is a welcome response to the recent (imo) irresponsible hyping of cross-strait risk by influential US actors.

Most U.S. analysis frames China\u2019s options as a binary of peace or war and ignores these other elements. At the same time, many in Washington believe that if Beijing resorts to the use of force, the only military option it would consider is invasion. This is a dangerous oversimplification. China has many options to increase pressure on Taiwan, including military options short of invasion\u2014limited campaigns to seize Taiwan-held islands just off China\u2019s coast, blockades of Taiwan\u2019s ports, and economic quarantines to choke off the island\u2019s trade. Lesser options probably could not compel Taiwan\u2019s capitulation but could further isolate it economically and politically in an effort to raise pressure on the government in Taipei and induce it to enter into political negotiations on terms amenable to Beijing.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>An all-out invasion would be detected months in advance:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Any invasion of Taiwan will not be secret for months prior to Beijing\u2019s initiation of hostilities.
