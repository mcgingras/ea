We revised this report for publication. GiveWell does not necessarily endorse our conclusions, nor do the organizations represented by those who were interviewed.</p><p>The primary focus of the report is to review GiveWell\u2019s current formulation of its discount rate by recommending improvements and reinforcing justifications for areas that do not require improvement. Our research involved reviewing the scientific and gray literature, and we spoke with 15 experts and stakeholders.</p><p>We don\u2019t intend this report to be Rethink Priorities\u2019 final word on discount rates, and we have tried to flag major sources of uncertainty in the report. We hope this report galvanizes a productive conversation within the global health and development community about discounting practices in cost-effectiveness analyses. We are open to revising our views as more information is uncovered.</p><h2>Executive summary</h2><h3>Notes on the scope and process of this project</h3><p>This project aims to serve the dual purposes of reviewing GiveWell\u2019s current approach to calculating its discount rate(s) to:</p><ol><li>Provide recommendations to GiveWell on how its approach to discount rates could be improved.</li><li>Strengthen the justifications for its approach in cases where we do not recommend changes.</li></ol><p>The direction of this project was mainly guided by our priors<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsre4jnpdf3o\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsre4jnpdf3o\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;that a prioritized investigation into three aspects could potentially make the biggest difference to GiveWell\u2019s discount rate:</p><ol><li>A review of how other major organizations in the global health and development space (within and outside effective altruism) choose and justify their discount rates.</li><li>A review of GiveWell\u2019s overall approach to calculating discount rates to determine:<ol><li>Whether GiveWell should use a different overall calculation approach.</li><li>Whether GiveWell should think differently about discounting consumption vs. health outcomes.</li></ol></li><li>A review of the pure time preference component of GiveWell\u2019s discount rate.</li></ol><p>We also reviewed several other components of the discount rate (consumption growth rate, compounding non-monetary benefits, temporal uncertainty), but decided to spend less time on those as we deemed it less likely to make major recommendations or expected it would be harder to make meaningful progress. Table 1 summarizes our recommendations for GiveWell\u2019s discounting practices.</p><p>The majority of this report focuses on the discount rate used for consumption benefits, as this appears to be the \u201cmain\u201d discount rate used by GiveWell,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefnx7be73uc4r\"><sup><a href=\"#fnnx7be73uc4r\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;but we also discuss discounting of health benefits. We do not discuss discounting of costs in this report as (1) GiveWell\u2019s cost-effectiveness models rarely involve discounting costs, and (2) our general impression is that the typical approach across organizations is to discount monetary costs and benefits equally and we have seen very little discussion of alternative approaches.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9kc5172ymng\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9kc5172ymng\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;A review of the shape of the utility functions<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefm8t89bpe4d\"><sup><a href=\"#fnm8t89bpe4d\">[4]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;used is also out of scope for this review. Moreover, we focus exclusively on temporal discounting.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreffkprg2orw6b\"><sup><a href=\"#fnfkprg2orw6b\">[5]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;If the time frame is not specified, all discount rates expressed as percentages are annual. Due to the variety of existing opinions and approaches with respect to discount rates and a relative lack of consensus, we opted to approach this project from a perspective of figuring out whether there are any compelling reasons to change GiveWell\u2019s current approach, rather than starting from scratch and coming up with a discount rate independently of the current approach.</p><h3>Summary of recommendations</h3><p><strong>Table 1:</strong> Summary of Rethink Priorities\u2019 recommendations for GiveWell\u2019s discounting</p><figure class=\"table\" style=\"width:1070.29px\"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Consideration</strong></td><td><strong>Current GiveWell choice</strong></td><td><strong>Rethink Priorities\u2019 recommendation</strong></td><td><strong>Comments</strong></td></tr><tr><td><strong>Overall annual discount rate</strong></td><td><strong>4.0%</strong></td><td><p><strong>4.3%</strong></p><p><strong>(if current inconsistent choice of \u03b7 is kept)</strong></p></td><td><ul><li><strong>The 0.3 percentage point increase is a result of an increased consumption growth rate estimate and a small change in the formula used to calculate the wealth effect.

I know it\u2019s traditional in EA to stick to the facts and avoid emotional content, but I can\u2019t help but interject and say that this fundraising appeal is a bit different. It is personal to me. It\u2019s not just a list of things that we could take or leave, it\u2019s a fight for RP to survive the way I want it to as an organization that is intellectually independent and serves the EA community.</p><p>To be blunt, our funding situation is not where we want it to be. 2023 has been a hard year for fundraising.&nbsp;<strong>A lot of what we\u2019ve been building over the past few years is at risk right now.</strong> If you like RP, my sense is donating now is an unusually good time.</p><p><strong>We are at the point where receiving $1,000 - $10,000 each from a handful of individual donors would genuinely make an important difference to the future trajectory of RP</strong> and decide what we can and cannot do next year.</p><p>We are currently seeking to raise at least $110K total from donors donating under $100K each. We are already ~$25K towards that goal, so there's $85K remaining towards our goal.

We do get some institutional support for this, but not enough to cover our costs. Since it is a diffuse community public good, there is no particular funder interested in supporting it, and the many EA groups that value this work don\u2019t have enough money to actually support it.&nbsp;<strong>Given that funding has been harder in 2023 than in previous years, it\u2019s possible that we would not be able to run the EA Survey without dedicated funding.</strong></p><p>We also provide a lot of private analyses pro bono to community members who request them, such as EA group organizers that don\u2019t have the budget to commission these requests but nevertheless value our insights. We\u2019d appreciate having more monetary support to be able to support these groups.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>$40K-100K to more rigorously understand branding for EA and existential risk</h3><p>There has been much debate about whether people engaged in EA and longtermism should frame their efforts and outreach in terms of \u2018effective altruism\u2019, \u2018longtermism\u2019, \u2018existential risk\u2019, \u2018existential security\u2019, \u2018global priorities research\u2019, or by only mentioning specific risks, such as AI Safety and pandemic prevention.

This will allow us to assess how responses to these different approaches differ in different dimensions (e.g. popularity, persuasiveness, interest, dislike).</p><p>Our survey and data analysis team has a good track record of running rigorous survey experiments to get to the bottom of complex low salience issues (for one example, see&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/CwKiAt54aJjcqoQDh/are-1-in-5-americans-familiar-with-ea\"><u>\u201cAre 1-in-5 Americans familiar with EA?\u201d</u></a>).</p><p>We\u2019d do message/framing/branding testing of \u201ceffective altruism\u201d, \u201cglobal priorities\u201d, \u201ceffective giving\u201d, \u201clongtermism, \u201cexistential risk\u201d, \u201cexistential security\u201d, and concrete causes (e.g., AI risk). We\u2019d build on our research mentioned by Will Macaskill&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/KDjEogAqWNTdddF9g/long-termism-vs-existential-risk?commentId=eXpqe8mHEEHTLy9jL\"><u>in this comment</u></a>.</p><p>This research could be divided up in various ways e.g.</p><ul><li>Assess how people respond to the brand \u201ceffective altruism\u201d and see what they associate with it, what they understand or expect it to mean, what if anything they dislike about it</li><li>Test whether people respond better to \u201cprinciples-based EA\u201d messaging vs specific causes</li><li>Test whether people respond better to broader \u201ceffective altruism\u201d or narrower longtermism/x-risk</li><li>Test whether people respond better to \u201clongtermism\u201d or \u201cexistential risk\u201d or \u201cexistential security\u201d or concrete causes<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>$25K-$100K to more rigorously understand EA\u2019s growth trajectory</h3><p>As stated&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vXzEnBcG7BipkRSrF/how-has-ftx-s-collapse-impacted-ea\"><u>in one recent post</u></a>:&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>It seems obvious to me that numerous stakeholders-- including organization leaders, donors of all sizes, group leaders, and entrepreneurs-- would all benefit from having an accurate understanding of EA\u2019s growth trajectory. And it seems just as obvious that it would be tremendously inefficient for each of those parties to conduct their own analysis. It would be in everyone\u2019s interest to receive a regular (every 3-6 months?) update from a reliable analyst. This wouldn\u2019t be expensive (it wouldn\u2019t require anything close to a full-time job initially, though the frequency and/or depth of the analyses could be scaled up if people saw value in doing so). As public goods go, this should be an easy one to provide.</p></blockquote><p>We\u2019d be happy to provide this service with sufficient funding.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><h3>$40K to more rigorously understand branding for AI risk outreach<br>&nbsp;</h3><p>We\u2019d like to do some of the following to better understand AI risk outreach:</p><ul><li>Run messaging experiments to conduct fundamental research into what factors make AI risk cases more persuasive to different audiences (e.g. do people respond better or worse to strong \u2018Yudkowsky-style\u2019 messages which emphasize risk of extinction, or high urgency, or high probability of doom).</li><li>Testing whether providing certain information relevant to AI risk (e.g. X experts say Y; in the year before flight was developed, many experts said that it would be years off) changes people\u2019s views</li><li>Understand how the public thinks about risk from open source AI models<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><h3>$50K to more rigorously understand why people drop out of EA</h3><p>The EA Survey only captures those who currently are close enough to EA to see and want to fill out the survey. So far, no one has done much analysis of those who join the community and then leave. Using referrals and snowball sampling, we would recruit a small number of people who dropped out of or bounced off EA to assess what the main factors are leading people to not join to leave EA.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Animal welfare</h2><p>We believe that animal welfare is an important global problem that has been greatly neglected by charitable organizations and, to a lesser extent, by the effective altruist community. Nevertheless, we think that there are promising avenues for improving the lives of nonhuman animals and that further research can significantly contribute to optimizing current efforts and uncovering new impactful solutions to help these individuals.</p><p>Given their importance, relative neglectedness and tractability, and the strength of our research team, we believe we have a great opportunity to help animals by addressing some critical questions that affect farmed and wild animals, and other needs of the movement defending non-humans.</p><p>However, we don\u2019t have much widespread support for this work and we are preparing for the possibility of&nbsp;<strong>getting less money in the future from Open Phil&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-planned-allocation-to-givewells-recommendations-for-the-next-few-years/#our-higher-bar-for-global-health-and-wellbeing-giving\"><strong><u>due to shifts in their priorities</u></strong></a>. Historically we have spent a large amount of unrestricted funding on our animal welfare work and we are looking for new individual donors to help.&nbsp;</p><p>Without your support, we suspect a lot of additional work here won\u2019t happen, and much of what will happen will be private, and designed for specific donors.</p><p>We list below some potential directions we\u2019d like to take our work.<br>&nbsp;</p><h3>$250K to create a review of interventions to reduce the consumption of animal products</h3><p>Over the last five years, the volume of research on interventions to reduce edible animal product consumption has grown significantly. However, this research is difficult to access and disperse. This project would provide the evidential basis for identifying classes of effective (or ineffective) interventions to reduce the consumption of animal-based products, from classroom education to plant-based analogues to changes in menu design. We'll review the literature for each, address some foundational uncertainties, and assess the cost-effectiveness of various approaches. We expect to produce intervention briefs, summarizing critical evidence, a live and user-friendly database of evidence for various interventions, and reports with applied recommendations for advocates and other interested players.<br>&nbsp;</p><h3>$38K to create a Farmed Animals Impact Tracker</h3><p>Farmed Animals Impact Tracker: establish a comprehensive database for reliably assessing the cost-effectiveness of interventions, starting with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://openwingalliance.org/\"><u>cage-free corporate pledges</u></a>, and the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://betterchickencommitment.com/us/\"><u>Better Chicken Commitment.</u></a> We expect this would produce a reliable source to assess some of the most popular interventions addressed to help hens and chickens. This work could later be expanded to include other interventions targeting other animals (see below).</p><h3><br>$75K to understand interventions that would address fish welfare</h3><p>Our work on promising new recommendations for improving the welfare of farmed and hatchery-reared fish has identified some improvements that currently lack widespread implementation. This project will further investigate such ideas, focusing on their potential tractability and cost-effectiveness so as to conclude whether they merit further promotion by advocacy groups, certifiers and others interested in improving fish welfare.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>$60K to understand interventions that would address crustacean welfare</h3><p>Based on the major welfare challenges faced by shrimp, this report will make recommendations for positively altering farming conditions and practices, and, whenever possible, point out already-available interventions and other strategies that might slow down the growth ot this sector. It will also suggest critical future research directions to better understand shrimp welfare and uncover new and likely more impactful interventions in the future.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>$50K for development and implementation of an insect farming welfare ask</h3><p>In 20 years, if we look back to study missed opportunities to help animals, failing to help insects industrially farmed for food and feed production could very well be the largest mistake the effective animal advocacy community has made. This is a pivotal decade for the industry: regulations are being considered and written for the first time, and new factories are being designed and built. This welfare ask could greatly shape the industry\u2019s practices.&nbsp;</p><p>It will require producers to commit to standards for breeding, hygiene, slaughter, and reporting standards. While the first draft and strategic approach are still being developed, it may include other requirements as well. RP research will support incremental improvements to this ask, especially with regard to rearing standards and slaughter methods.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>$100K to develop a database of possible near-term interventions for wild animals</h3><p>Recent techonological progress suggest that there might be currently feasible methods to help wildlife populations at some scale. This project aims to identify and describe already available technologies and interventions to help wild animals, collect some initial evidence for each of them, and a shallow assessment of the potential impact of such interventions along with possible challenges. This information will be presented in a user-friendly database that might serve the wild animal welfare community in identifying the most promising interventions, current knowledge gaps, and other drawbacks, and guide further assessment or intervention implementation efforts.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>$75K to do a theory of change status report for the animal advocacy movement</h3><p>Various theories of change prevail in the farmed animal movement. It need not be the case that most organizations agree on one. Still, it is certainly possible to take stock of the evidence for and against each of them and, thus, discourage further resources into ones where the evidence suggests the theory fails to produce the expected results or look into potential alternative drivers, if any. By breaking theories of change down into testable hypotheses and specific KPIs, and mapping interventions onto those hypotheses, evidence on the hypotheses' indicators would generate an overall health status of each theory. This work could inform strategic resource allocation and generate motivation to run interventions and research to fill critical gaps in the grid. Additionally, this project might identify potential failure modes in theories of change and then pointing to ways to mitigate against those.<br>&nbsp;</p><h3>$300K to develop a better system similar to QALYs/DALYs but for animals</h3><p>If we want to impartially do the most good for animals, we need to be able to translate benefits to them into units of measures that allow comparisons with other global priorities.&nbsp;In this regard, DALYs-averted is the common currency used by many to assess how much good they can do by helping humans. We can use the DALYs framework and treat it as a proxy for some amount of welfare for non-humans. With this project, we will attempt to translate species-specific animal welfare assessments into welfare estimates relative to each species under different conditions. Then,&nbsp;such calculations can be translated into a standard unit\u2013DALYs. The estimates produced could be especially useful in guiding the allocation of resources as they provide a common numerator, allowing for the expression of utility in terms of dollar/DALY. Moreover, this would give a valuable summary that might be used to engage other stakeholders\u2013like economists and policymakers\u2013to visualize the impact of various farming systems on animals.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Global Health and Development</h2><h3>$405K to pilot our Value of Research model</h3><p>Our Global Health and Development team is currently funded by both Open Philanthropy and GiveWell to do research for them<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1gj4m0sz2j2\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1gj4m0sz2j2\">[11]</a></sup></span>. However, we have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/RQzieJvu6Ecmgagbp/a-model-estimating-the-value-of-research-influencing-funders\"><u>new value of research model</u></a> that we\u2019d like to try out that suggests we can be more cost-effective than most GHD interventions within the GHD-prioritizing worldview, but unfortunately this seems to be outside the scope of our current funders\u2019 priorities.</p><p>This model suggests that we actually could have more impact with GHD research from taking a non-EA organization from a low to medium cost-effectiveness as opposed to working with OpenPhil and GiveWell to find slightly more cost-effective interventions than what they are currently supporting. This seems to be true even if the likelihood of securing work with those organizations and updating their conclusions is lower, and the ultimate target intervention(s) we might get them to update to is not as cost-effective as GiveWell\u2019s top charities.</p><p>We\u2019d seek $405K for a pilot for six months \u2013 this would be a highly leveraged investment to buy us enough time to attract new clients and find new streams of funding from them. The wider global health and development community is large and we think there are many potential clients we could be working with. The more general support we have to attempt this, the lower hourly rate we can charge to our clients, which means we\u2019ll have a greater chance of attracting potential clients.</p><p>RP\u2019s GHD team is well-positioned to execute a plan to do this but without further funding we think there\u2019s an uncomfortably high chance that we\u2019ll fail before we get a chance to actually test this model. Our current major funders aren\u2019t backing this as much as is needed in part because of differing mandates (i.e., making grants that are achieving impact via grantmaking directly on interventions or research rather than this more indirect route), and in part because our funders have been shifting away from the GHD space more generally. But without this funding, the team as it currently exists is unlikely to persist even though they are well set up to do very cost-effective work.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnreff7e60acfisu\"><sup><a href=\"#fnf7e60acfisu\">[12]</a></sup></span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>AI Governance</h2><h3>$15K to write up learnings from spending a year attempting longtermist incubation</h3><p>Our Existential Security team worked in 2023 towards researching projects and finding external founders to run them. We\u2019re now pivoting to running those projects in-house instead.</p><p>However, we\u2019d like to write an evaluation of our longtermist incubation efforts in 2023 and provide high-level lessons. We\u2019d also like to assemble key info we gathered on a lot of our project ideas and explain why we ended up not pursuing them. We think this would be useful for people who might do or fund similar work in the future. We\u2019d explain what happened to our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/AJwuMw7ddcKQNFLcR/20-concrete-projects-for-reducing-existential-risk\"><u>20 concrete project ideas</u></a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3>$114K to train an additional AI policy researcher</h3><p>We\u2019ve been able to take skilled generalist researchers with not much experience in AI policy and skill them up to the point where they can do AI policy research that is high enough quality to be engaged with from labs, regulators, and other policymakers. Getting additional funding would also be valuable for maintaining intellectual independence, which is crucial for a think tank.</p><p>We estimate that we could train a marginal additional person for $69K in salary, $9K in tax and HR fees, $8K in benefits, $7K in travel and professional development support, and $21K in marginal spending on operations.</p><p><br>-</p><p>We also have more speculative plans that may be of interest to longtermist donors and we can take longtermist restricted support with minimal to no fungibility issues. Please inquire to&nbsp;<a href=\"mailto:peter@rethinkpriorities.org\"><u>peter@rethinkpriorities.org</u></a> if you want to explore this.</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Included with your donation: talent pipelines and field building</h2><p>Another important benefit to funding the work above that goes under-discussed is the effect of our work on talent pipelines and field building. We can hire in most countries and are pretty agnostic about location, so this allows us to engage a much wider international community and find hidden talent.</p><p>For example, Rethink Priorities is an important institution for supporting the reduction of existential risk for AI. Between RP and other organizations we support (IAPS, Apollo, and Epoch), I estimate we employ directly or indirectly (via fiscal sponsorship) 40 people working to reduce existential risk from AI, which I take to be somewhere between 3% to 10% of the entire global workforce aimed at this. That\u2019s a significant contribution to AI x-risk reduction capacity. We likewise employ and support a similarly significant fraction of the number of researchers oriented towards effective animal advocacy.</p><p>Many of our staff also had not engaged much, or not at all, with effective altruism prior to joining RP, but then engaged with the movement and its ideas heavily during and after their RP career. This makes RP a great way to expose talented professionals to EA and give them a lot of experience and orientation to working on it, launching their EA career.</p><p>While we don\u2019t view our impact as solely coming from talent pipelines, many people get training at RP and then go on to do other impactful things. Staff that we\u2019ve hired have gone on to have impactful jobs at Open Philanthropy, the Long-Term Future Fund, AI Safety Communications Centre, the EA Forum, major US think tanks, and US state-level government. We\u2019ve also supported secondments into the UK government and are interested in exploring other ways to help our staff get involved in government work more directly.</p><p>It seems like management roles at many orgs largely get picked from people who have done management before. By building a strong and fairly large organization and by doing formal and informal management training, we\u2019ve given a lot of people the opportunity to become experienced managers. Several of our staff have been trained up by us to take important management roles at Rethink Priorities or other organizations, including at Open Philanthropy.</p><p>Lastly, our staff support the wider EA community by attending EA Globals and other conferences and mentoring others in the field. Our staff have created many coordination vehicles, such as conferences, paper archives, and Slack channels.<br><br>All of this talent pipelines, field building, and coordination comes merely from supporting RP in our object-level work. We hope you will keep these benefits in mind.<br>&nbsp;</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>RP needs your support \u2013 and we need it to keep doing the work we have been doing, not just do more projects. This is not a proposal for&nbsp;<i>growth&nbsp;</i>\u2013 this is a proposal to keep RP to be what we want it to be. We want RP to be a project that helps the EA community<i> as a whole</i>, in addition to our individual clients and stakeholders.</p><p>At its core, RP wants to implement a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/MP9qDZCXMaTJhiJ9u/ea-is-three-radical-ideas-i-want-to-protect\"><u>principles-first EA</u></a>: principled selections of areas to work in, principle-derived attempts to do good at scale, and principle-based updates about how to do the most good. The uncertainties involved in doing good can be daunting and changemaking is difficult. We need to rigorously quantify the value of different courses of action, we need to grapple with multiple decision theories or worldviews, and in order to create change, deeply engage with key stakeholders within priority areas to affect beliefs, actions, and outcomes.</p><p>We hope that this list shows you that RP is up to a wide variety of vibrant work and that we really need your support to keep this going. We\u2019d be interested in you&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bit.ly/supportrethinkpriorities\"><strong><u>donating here</u></strong></a> or reaching out to us with offers to fund specific projects on this list. We can honor donor restrictions and preferences with minimal to no fungibility issues, simply reach out to us at development@rethinkpriorities.org.</p><p><strong>We\u2019d be especially keen to receive more unrestricted support from people who trust us</strong> most to allow us to innovate more with our own ideas and prototype ideas to attract the attention of larger funders. This donor diversity gives us a lot more flexibility, lets us solve collective action problems, gives us valuable intellectual independence, and just gives us peace of mind.&nbsp;</p><p>We tend to choose projects as and when we\u2019re wrapping up other projects, rather than further in advance, due to rapid shifts in the field and our understanding. But this is very hard to do if we specify everything on a project-by-project basis and wait 6+ months between coming up with an idea and receiving funding. RP staff value and work best with a sense of security and planning for the long-term is more cost-effective than more shortsighted behavior. So trust is really helpful in allowing us to do our best work.</p><p>We are generally happy to try and expand further upon request. Prospective funders may be welcome to have a call with team members or leadership in order to further discuss any of the above.&nbsp;</p><p>Interested readers are encouraged to refer to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xbqiYyj6kdmraEqoX/rethink-priorities-2023-summary-2024-strategy-and-funding\"><u>\u201cRethink Priorities\u2019 2023 Summary, 2024 Strategy, and Funding Gaps\u201d</u></a> for further details.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://bit.ly/supportrethinkpriorities\"><strong><u>Please consider supporting us as much as you can.</u></strong></a><strong>&nbsp;</strong>Thank you.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/cMcEBSNiy4meDrmuE/xmuqvognnioweaf5ccsb\"></p><h1>Acknowledgements</h1><p>This was written by Peter Wildeford, with contributions from Kieran Greig, Marcus A.

Here are some suggestions for how you could find dialogue partners:</p><ul><li>Asking someone you know, or private-messaging</li><li>Commenting on a post you\u2019re interested in discussing with someone.&nbsp;</li><li>Commenting here if you\u2019d like to talk about donation choice</li><li>Posting a quick take (inviting people to change your mind, discuss your uncertainties, or anything else)</li></ul><h3>Setting up the dialogue</h3><p>To create the dialogue, hover your mouse over your profile in the top right corner.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YhMJasA8MaFQCWcA5/xduiuarvbicmfury9boa\"><figcaption>Screenshot of what happens when you hover over your profile.</figcaption></figure><p>After you click on \u201cNew dialogue\u201d you will get the following pop-up:</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YhMJasA8MaFQCWcA5/unypxbd8oqlnvlnuktf8\"><figcaption>Screenshot of the pop-up</figcaption></figure><p>Title your dialogue. You can change this later. Add the participant(s). (You can add more participants later.) Click \u201ccreate dialogue\u201d. &nbsp;The other participants will get notified.</p><h3>Writing and editing your dialogue</h3><p>Next you\u2019ll see the dialogue editor. Here, you can write and edit your dialogue collaboratively.&nbsp;<strong>Nothing is public or final until you decide to publish.</strong> The other participants will be able to see everything you write (even in your drafting box).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YhMJasA8MaFQCWcA5/wwdnstvsextxdzovasb4\"><figcaption>Screenshot of the dialogue editor</figcaption></figure><p>To write the body of the dialogue, use the drafting box with your username on it. Write your comment and click submit to insert it above the drafting boxes. You\u2019ll be able to see the other participants' comments as they write them.&nbsp;</p><p>Once you have both started writing, you can:</p><ul><li>Suggest edits to the other participants' comments by typing in their writing box or in one of their already submitted comments.<img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YhMJasA8MaFQCWcA5/temupttwyfzybyhlwph3\"></li><li>Move your comments around in the dialogue, or suggest moving your partner\u2019s. To do this, hover over your submitted line of dialogue, and click and drag the square which appears above the top left corner. <img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/YhMJasA8MaFQCWcA5/ec2mtby3stubu6gavvgz\"></li></ul><p>You don\u2019t have to write your dialogue in one sitting. However, to avoid your dialogue being deleted between sessions, make sure you \u201csave as draft\u201d when you exit the dialogue editor. You can find the \u201csave as draft\u201d button to the left of the publish button, right at the bottom of the page. You will get notifications when your co-author submits new comments.</p><p>When your dialogue is finished, any of the participants can publish the dialogue. You will appear as co-authors on the finished post. Your dialogue will be treated like a normal post.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref9r6mi0lhqqd\"><sup><a href=\"#fn9r6mi0lhqqd\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;</p><p>Example dialogues on LessWrong:&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/K2D45BNxnZjdpSX2j/ai-timelines\"><u>AI Timelines</u></a>&nbsp;</li><li><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/jyM7MSTvy8Qs6aZcz/what-s-up-with-responsible-scaling-policies\"><u>What's up with \"Responsible Scaling Policies\"?</u></a>&nbsp;</li><li>(See&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/dialogues\"><u>here for all LessWrong dialogues</u></a>.)</li></ul><h2><strong>Example dialogue (a recreation of a discussion that happened before we shipped this post)</strong></h2><section class=\"dialogue-message ContentStyles-debateResponseBody\" message-id=\"SuPnfB9qqKWsucNzm-Tue, 21 Nov 2023 14:58:46 GMT\" user-id=\"SuPnfB9qqKWsucNzm\" display-name=\"Lizka\" submitted-date=\"Tue, 21 Nov 2023 14:58:46 GMT\" user-order=\"2\"><section class=\"dialogue-message-header CommentUserName-author UsersNameDisplay-noColor\"><b>Lizka</b></section><div><p>We\u2019re announcing dialogues.

Since our inception in November 2021, we've conducted various programmes, interacting with &gt;500 medical doctors and students from around the world. Our activities include&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.highimpactmedicine.org/intro-fellowship\"><u>fellowships</u></a> (&gt;320 participants),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.highimpactmedicine.org/1-on-1-career-advice\"><u>coaching calls</u></a> (&gt;210 calls), setting up&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.highimpactmedicine.org/mentorship-programme\"><u>mentoring relationships</u></a> (&gt;33 pairs), producing a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/7uYCc5nrM4q49EBEnnhFnZ\"><u>podcast</u></a>&nbsp;(15 episodes), writing&nbsp;academic publications (<a href=\"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0284856\"><u>1 published</u></a> and 1 under development), and setting up a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://sites.google.com/georgetown.edu/selectivesfall2023/friday-courses\"><u>university collaboration</u></a>.&nbsp;We've grown our community to &gt;760 newsletter subscribers and &gt;460 Slack members. Please have a look at our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_JpaONl5wJ-F4Tqc2csZSWYitJoO1llZiJQtF7MUvVg/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>Theory of Change</u></a>&nbsp;and our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1r-SZoNVGEgBXEWrdPzD9X0rEL5ruOIn9wQQ5o3Qyi_Y/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>2023 Impact Survey Executive Summary</u></a> to get a better understanding of our work.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Rationale</strong></h3><p>There are millions of doctors and medical students in the world, and many of them are (unsurprisingly) already motivated to help others (Gy\u0151rffy, Birk\u00e1s, &amp; S\u00e1ndor, 2016; Xu, 2014; Yang et al., 2021). There is a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://probablygood.org/career-profiles/medicine/\"><u>very wide range of positively impactful careers</u></a> for which medical students or doctors could be a good fit if they choose to pursue them, and they do not all require specialty training or clinical work. Through such careers, it is possible to work on some of the major problems in the world, from pandemic prevention to reducing antibiotic resistance. Many of these career options can span multiple disciplines, including academic research, policy formulation and implementation, operations, advising, and advocacy. With sufficient forward planning, some of these paths may allow individuals to do far more good than an average clinical career; furthermore, many of these paths can be pursued alongside, before, after, or even instead of specialty training.</p><p>Despite this, medical career planning is often assumed to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ama-assn.org/medical-students/specialty-profiles/future-physicians-whens-right-time-choose-specialty\"><u>mainly</u></a> involve selecting a specialty and progressing through speciality training. It is also common for career advice to implicitly assume that doctors will either be working in a hospital or a clinic/practice (e.g., this is implicitly assumed&nbsp;<a href=\"https://careers.jamanetwork.com/article/clinic-or-hospital-where-will-you-be-the-happiest-\"><u>here</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://psdconnect.org/journal/a-comprehensive-physician-job-transition-checklist\"><u>here</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bma.org.uk/advice-and-support/studying-medicine/becoming-a-doctor/medical-training-pathway\"><u>here</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>We have collaborated with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://probablygood.org/\"><u>Probably Good</u></a> to produce a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://probablygood.org/career-profiles/medicine/\"><u>career guide</u></a> that aims to make medical students and doctors aware of the wide range of ways in which they can have a high-impact career (including, but without necessarily limiting themselves to, the \u201ctraditional\u201d options available to them). But when it comes to actually putting these principles into practice, we have noticed that many of the people we talk to who aspire to help the world are hesitant to spend time on career planning. Career planning can be a complex and challenging topic, leaving many people unsure where to start. Finding time for career planning can be difficult, and it's often a challenge to locate helpful resources.</p><p>Additionally, figuring out one's career path alone can be confusing, and you might not know who to talk to, learn from, or check in with.

However, the feedback we received was very helpful in qualitatively identifying the ways in which we were creating or failing to create the outcomes we hoped for.</p><p>It seems that the programme was well-received by the pilot cohorts: they appeared to enjoy it (Figure 3) and were likely to recommend it to others with similar interests to them (Figure 4). This provides some tentative evidence that the programme was engaging and that it aligned relatively well with participants\u2019 interests.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nPKr9AAuTnCX7uJy7/zx6ug3a2wwxbhnwusiwc\"><br><strong>Figure 3: Fellows\u2019 responses to the question, \u201cHow did you like the fellowship overall?\u201d&nbsp;</strong>Available response options ranged from \u201cVery poor,\u201d 1, to \u201cExcellent,\u201d 10.</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nPKr9AAuTnCX7uJy7/tjz44e7eheypphhw6zuc\"></p><p><strong>Figure 4: Fellows\u2019 responses to the question, \u201cWould you recommend the programme to a friend with similar interests to you?\u201d</strong> Available response options ranged from \u201cDefinitely not,\u201d 0, to \u201cDefinitely,\u201d 5.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Summary of general lessons we learned from developing and evaluating our Career Fellowship pilot programme</strong></h3><p>We provide the context for the first six lessons in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FfmXvRzvJtHc9lLc1gSBBkTzsRKPBf5ci6C_IHjfH2E/edit\"><u>Appendices</u></a>. The last lesson is expanded upon in the next section.</p><ol><li>There are many high-quality resources available for planning high-impact careers. This helped us to design the fellowship&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FfmXvRzvJtHc9lLc1gSBBkTzsRKPBf5ci6C_IHjfH2E/edit#heading=h.6md7pmrpdd5p\"><u>curriculum</u></a> efficiently.&nbsp;</li><li>It takes at least 20 hours of work to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FfmXvRzvJtHc9lLc1gSBBkTzsRKPBf5ci6C_IHjfH2E/edit#heading=h.2g36vsa2oopj\"><u>prepare</u></a> to run a five-week-long Career Fellowship.</li><li>There appears to be demand for this fellowship.

For example:&nbsp;<ul><li>All of our fellows were medical students or doctors who placed a strong emphasis on having a positive impact when planning their careers.</li><li>Our content tended to focus on short- and medium-term goals, which made it useful to the majority of our fellows, who were facing imminent career decisions. The programme was less useful for the minority of participants who weren\u2019t facing imminent career decisions.</li><li>We believe that much of the value of the fellowship arises from the fact that it provides a mechanism by which fellows are guaranteed to spend at least ~15-20 hours on career planning. For people who\u2019ve already spent significant time on career planning, the fellowship may have been less useful.&nbsp;</li></ul></li><li>At the same time as setting up the programme, it\u2019s worth investing significant time in planning how to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FfmXvRzvJtHc9lLc1gSBBkTzsRKPBf5ci6C_IHjfH2E/edit#heading=h.x3o6qgqmlf05\"><u>evaluate</u></a> programmes over time.</li><li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FfmXvRzvJtHc9lLc1gSBBkTzsRKPBf5ci6C_IHjfH2E/edit#heading=h.49wsu278062l\"><u>Both</u></a> positive and negative feedback is critical for iteratively improving your programme over time.</li><li>Running a programme like this is a process of continual&nbsp;<u>learning</u>.

I never expected it to turn out so helpful to have a clear and structured way to sort through all my areas of interest and potential next steps. That was one of the main things I learned through initiating the Career Fellowship.&nbsp;</p><p>Helping to set up and run the Career Fellowship also helped me to test my personal fit for entrepreneurial roles. On this subject, I would like to share some insights regarding how I initiated and ran this programme, and what I\u2019ve learned from it. I think that many of the points listed below could be helpful to others setting up similar programmes.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/nPKr9AAuTnCX7uJy7/ndiidzhhbgy7rwxqcs8c\"><strong>Figure 6: The timeline from the conception of the idea to the execution of the pilot programme.&nbsp;</strong>The idea was initially developed in February 2022. I decided to begin acting on it in October 2022, and developed the curriculum with the help of others in the team between November 2022 and February 2023. The pilot programme itself ran from March to April 2023.</p><p><strong>What I found valuable and can recommend\u2026</strong></p><p><strong>\u2026 before starting the project:</strong></p><ul><li>Figuring out your theory of change and discussing it with the team.</li><li>Recognising what each of your team members brings to the team (including their viewpoints, ideas, and strategies).</li><li>Having a mentor who pushes you to think about timelines, roles, and resources required, taking your situation into account.</li><li>Finding your own blindspots (like underestimating the time needed to complete things).</li><li>Making it a priority to work on your blindspots. For me, this has meant investing in personal organisation and self-management, e.g., task and knowledge management, calendars and reminders, communication platforms, and a lot more, and setting up systems that work for you. If possible, test them in advance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>I was surprised that just planning a project can take more than 20 hours, not including research beforehand.&nbsp;</li><li>For the project itself, I was very happy to have a main directory document ready ahead of time (to organise everything about the project).</li><li>&nbsp;for you. If possible, test them in advance.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>I was surprised that just planning a project can take more than 20 hours, not including research beforehand.&nbsp;</li><li>For the project itself, I was very happy to have a main directory document ready ahead of time (to organise everything about the project).</li></ul><p><strong>\u2026 during the project:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li>I found it particularly valuable to have a shared project lead, and would recommend this to anybody.&nbsp;</li><li>Furthermore, communication is key. Communicate regularly and effectively and create a strategy that fits you. Personally, I appreciated group calls once a week to coordinate todos, share experiences from the sessions, and check whether everyone received the information needed.</li><li>Lastly, I also discussed our methodological ideas and my findings with friends and colleagues and found their feedback very valuable.</li></ul><p><strong>\u2026 evaluating the project:</strong></p><ul><li>If you want to use an evaluation platform that is new to you, get good guidance for the whole evaluation process.&nbsp;</li><li>I personally struggled a lot to not lose myself in details. Try to avoid perfectionism and look for the \"big results,\" such as unexpected outcomes, great changes, or valid feedback.&nbsp;</li><li>Set yourself a realistic timeline.</li><li>Plan a good handover to facilitate the continuity of the project.&nbsp;<br><br><i><strong>From all this, I learned a lesson:&nbsp;</strong></i>Running a programme like this is a process of continual learning. It helps to invest a lot of time in planning, seeking feedback from others, and iteratively improving.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>Finally, I would like to say that I am very grateful for what I have learned. I was surrounded by extremely warm people who helped me, supported me whenever questions arose or when I was struggling, and pushed me to make the fellowship what it was. In running this fellowship, I tackled a problem I had faced for more than a year. Running the Career Fellowship created a feeling of agency that I never imagined before.</p><p>Therefore, I would like to thank the organisations and the people without whom this programme would not have been possible. I was particularly inspired by EA Germany\u2019s Career Fellowship to run the programme. We were also able to set up the programme quickly due to being able to build on resources from the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.globalchallengesproject.org/\"><u>Global Challenges Project</u></a> (for our Week 1 working document),&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.clearerthinking.org/\"><u>Clearer Thinking</u></a> (for our workshops in Weeks 3 and 4), the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/\"><u>Effective Altruism Forum</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/\"><u>80,000 Hours</u></a> (for our readings), and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.charityentrepreneurship.com/\"><u>Charity Entrepreneurship&nbsp;</u></a>(for our Weighted Factor Model Template).</p><p>Personally, I would like to thank&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/louisa-rasp-1\"><u>Louisa Rasp</u></a> (<a href=\"http://linkedin.com/in/louisa-rasp-6317aa1b4\"><u>LinkedIn</u></a>), who worked with me to create the fellowship, including setting its strategy, putting together the content and its M&amp;E, was a crucial co-facilitator and manager for me, and further improved the programme as a manager for our summer cohort.

To note, we're posting here in our capacities as cofounders of FWI.</p><p>We're planning to post a fuller update in the coming week, but wanted to make this funding-specific post for Marginal Funding Week. Here, we discuss what we'd do with marginal funds, as well as the reasons for and against a donation to FWI.</p><h2>What would FWI do with marginal funds?</h2><p><strong>Marginal funding right now would go to filling FWI's 2024 funding gap</strong>, which is most of our ~$750,000 <a href=\"https://fwi.fish/budget\">annual budget</a>. Specifically, this funding would go towards the following main outcomes:</p><ul><li><strong>Enabling several in-field studies</strong> to test welfare improvements and interventions that have the potential to be more promising than what we are currently implementing.</li><li><strong>Implementing our </strong><a href=\"http://fwi.fish/ara\"><strong>current program</strong></a> by expanding it to another 100 fish farms and helping the animals in these farms via stocking density and/or water quality improvements.</li><li><strong>Other work</strong> we believe is useful, such as policy and stakeholder work that may later enable us to more effectively scale.</li></ul><p>All of the above work will take place in India, which, primarily for its scale and tractability, we have identified as a country with particularly large potential for reducing farmed fish suffering. We will also likely conduct further work in China next year\u2014we intend to publish our plans for there in the coming months.</p><p>You can see FWI's planned <a href=\"https://fwi.fish/goals\">2024 OKRs</a> for more specific information.</p><h2>Reasons <i>in favor</i> of a donation to FWI</h2><p><i>Note that this and the following section are repeated from content present on our </i><a href=\"https://fwi.fish/donate\"><i>donation page FAQ</i></a><i>.</i></p><p>The following are some arguments in favor of donating to FWI, roughly in descending order of our view of their significance:</p><h3><strong>Reason #1: FWI\u2019s potential for impact</strong></h3><p>The scope of the problem we face is huge: Billions of farmed fishes live in our countries of operation (India and China) alone, their living conditions are often very poor, and virtually nothing has been done to address these issues so far. Furthermore, the fact that we have already had promising inroads with&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fwi.fish/ara\"><u>farmers</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/post/wcfaw\"><u>other key stakeholders</u></a> in these contexts suggests that we are able to make traction on these problems. Without any obvious limiting factors here then, we believe that, once at scale, our programming does have the potential to improve the lives of hundreds of millions, or even a billion, fishes. (Note though that our avenue to reach scale is still unclear\u2014see <i>reasons</i> <i>against</i> below.)</p><h3><strong>Reason #2: FWI\u2019s current impact</strong></h3><p>We currently&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fwi.fish/impact\"><u>estimate</u></a> that we\u2019ve improved the lives of over 1 million fishes. This makes FWI one of the most promising avenues in the world to reduce farmed fish suffering, and likely the most promising avenue in the world to reduce the suffering of farmed Indian major carp, one of the largest and most neglected species groups of farmed fishes.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Reason #3: FWI is addressing some of the animal movement\u2019s hardest questions</strong></h3><p>If we are ever going to bring about a world that is truly humane, we will need to address the more neglected groups in animal farming, particularly including farmed fishes and animals farmed in informal economies. We believe that FWI\u2019s work is demonstrating some avenues of helping these groups, and will thus enable other organizations to work more effectively on them. For instance, some of the lessons we learned in implementing our own farmer-centric work later inspired parts of the model that Shrimp Welfare Project is pursuing in their&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Qo3559TqP5BzoQyWX/two-years-of-shrimp-welfare-project-insights-and-impact-from\"><u>Sustainable Shrimp Farmers of India</u></a>.</p><h3><strong>Reason #4: Animal movement building in Asia</strong></h3><p>Almost&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.fishwelfareinitiative.org/aquaculture-in-asian-countries\"><u>90%</u></a> of farmed fishes, as well as the majority of farmed terrestrial animals, are in Asia. We thus believe it is critical to launch movements in Asian countries to address the suffering facing these animals, and to expand the animal movement by bringing in new people. We are proud to have hired a local team of about 17 full-time equivalent staff in India as well as contractors in China and the Philippines. We are also proud that most of these people did not work in animal protection previously, and are now more likely to have careers helping animals even after they leave FWI.</p><h2>Reasons <i>against</i> a donation to FWI</h2><p>While we think a donation to FWI is one of the more marginally impactful uses of money, it\u2019s not the right fit for all donors. Here\u2019s some reasons, again in descending order of our view of their significance, as to why you may not choose to donate to FWI:</p><h3><strong>Reason #1: The experimental, unprecedented nature of our work</strong></h3><p>Even though we are four years into working, FWI is still primarily in an explore/research stage for now. The welfare improvements we\u2019re making and seeking to make have never before been made at the scale or in the contexts where we make them\u2014and the evidence base on how to make such welfare improvements is sparse at best. All these facts have contributed to the frequent pivots we\u2019ve made, and the challenges our current model in India faces (see our upcoming post for a description of these challenges in further detail).</p><p>We are heavily investing in R&amp;D in 2024 to determine improved, evidence-based interventions to run in India, which will hopefully enable us to shift more to an implementation phase. However, until we have implemented and evaluated these interventions, we believe a donation to FWI should be regarded as enabling moderate but somewhat uncertain impact right now, and (hopefully) enabling much greater and more certain impact in the future.</p><h3><strong>Reason #2: Possibly supporting industry intensification</strong></h3><p>It is possible that by supporting farmers in addressing water quality and disease issues, we enable more farmers to get into the business and/or to make their farms more intensive. Note though that our team has considered this issue in medium depth and do not find it particularly compelling right now, in part because our stocking density caps are designed to prevent intensification. However, we believe it is still a reasonable concern one can have. To learn more about our thoughts here,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://fwi.fish/contact\"><u>contact us</u></a>.</p><p>We do&nbsp;<i>not</i> think the belief that fishes lack the ability to feel pain is a good argument against donating to FWI, as there is significant and increasing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-014-0761-0\"><u>evidence</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://plantbasednews.org/culture/law-and-politics/animals-fish-sentient-beings-uk-law/\"><u>consensus</u></a> that fishes do feel pain like most other vertebrates.</p><h2>Learn more</h2><p>We'll be posting a longer post about our strategy updates and plans for 2024 on the Forum in the coming week.

It was meant to be a helpful side project for friends and colleagues who wanted aggregated updates on the farmed animal advocacy movement. This quickly grew into other initiatives including a vibrant Slack community and active work in strategically connecting advocates. After the first year, we received some initial seed funding. This allowed for hiring the project founders for 1 day a week and this later progressed to one of the founders going full-time and the other becoming an advisor. Currently, we believe we have gotten through most of the challenges of early-stage organizational setup including creating and refining SOPs, OKRs, MEL metrics, project/task management systems, and obtaining&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.impactfulanimaladvocacy.org/blog/new-fiscal-sponsor\">fiscal sponsorship</a>.

We currently have three channels, #ai-tools, #ai-discussion and #ai-images, that facilitate education and collaboration.</p><p>While there are a couple of other groups working on AI for animals, our unique value adds are our adaptability, coordination/collaboration capacity, ability to identify gaps in the field, wide recognition as a resource for AI, low entry barrier for involvement, and active Slack channels for ongoing community engagement.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/ggB7mkw8G8ZAE8PSy/ughkqamcy2oqcickq6ji\" alt=\"\"><figcaption>An example of the conversations in our AI-related channels.</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Programme in action:</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/users/aaronboddy\">Aaron Boddy</a>, the co-founder of Shrimp Welfare Project, attended our AI workshop at AVA in LA.

Since we are already actively engaged with a variety of organizations, stay up to date with our online community, and attend key conferences, we feel we are especially well-positioned to facilitate connections strategically. This work is highly rewarding and we would feel compelled to do it even if we didn\u2019t have IAA, but the process of networking with others in mind, explaining to both parties why they should meet, making the warm intro, and checking in later on takes a lot of time so we decided to intentionally allocate working time for it.</p><p><strong>Programme in action:</strong></p><p>Since August 2023, we have successfully initiated over 100 strategic pairings.

We have been working with the EA Forum online team and believe upfront forum setup costs will be relatively low with the recently updated codebase. We are currently working with a volunteer developer. However, to ensure the forum's engagement and quality, we were advised it would require a content specialist, making funding for this role the primary constraint for the project.

We are also excited about growing the community in different regions, such as the global south.

While we have developed an extensive MEL system with defined early indicators, we are unlikely to understand the full extent of our impact, especially the more ambiguous second and third-order consequences of our work.</p><h3><strong>Project selection</strong></h3><p>There are many different opportunities and potential projects for us to pursue within the meta farmed animal advocacy space, and we have uncertainties about whether we have chosen optimally. We recently created a weighted factor model for our programs, but are still quite uncertain about which ones are the best for our theory of change. As we get more impact indicators, we will have more confidence in our project selection.</p><h3>Branding</h3><p>We are not sure if the current branding is appropriate and resonates with our audience. We are also concerned that the name feels too \u201cEA\u201d and prevents potential collaborations in the animal advocacy movement due to stigma. We are currently considering rebranding and would be open to any suggestions.</p><h3>Continuous engagement</h3><p>We have seen continuous growth in engagement on our platform. As community dynamics will inevitably change with growth, we are uncertain about how it will develop in the next year and beyond. We will need to find solutions to continue providing value to members while limiting any overwhelm. This will likely require close monitoring and careful experimentation with new guidelines, automation, or platforms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h2>Why donate to IAA?</h2><p>We understand that there are many different funding opportunities within the animal welfare space so we listed some characteristics of individuals that IAA would be a good fit for.</p><ul><li>If your theory of change puts a large weight on strengthening the animal advocacy movement in order to reduce animal suffering</li><li>If you\u2019re particularly interested in supporting farmed animal advocates in regions where it is hard for individuals to travel to major conferences for visa or financial reasons and can especially benefit from a helpful online community</li><li>If you\u2019re an IAA community member who benefits from our resources, donating is a helpful way to show your support. This also makes us more sustainable and less reliant on major funders.</li><li>If you are excited about supporting a small, but up-and-coming project at an early stage of development.</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><h2><strong>How to Contribute</strong></h2><p>Unrestricted donations can be made&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.impactfulanimaladvocacy.org/donate\">online</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>If you are interested in a certain facet of our work and want to make a restricted donation for a particular project, we are happy to work with you.

Whether you\u2019re reading this for your personal improvement or to make your workplace more effective, I\u2019d like to share some tips that seem universally applicable.</p><p>In general, the reason why we accumulate clutter and extra complication is because at our core nature, we\u2019re experience seekers. We want to find the one new thing, the next great improvement that will make the difference in making us more successful. And when we have it, we want more. Recognize that desire for change and embrace it \u2013 that\u2019s how we keep growing.&nbsp;</p><p>Here are my 5 favorite perspectives to keep in mind:</p><p><strong>1. If you lost it, would you buy it again?</strong></p><p>Each employee adds a valuable set of resources to the organization. They contribute unique dynamics, affect the culture, are part of a team, and produce results. Some employees do that better than others. Sometimes a job becomes less necessary over time as the marketplace demands change. If you can\u2019t look at an employee and their job and be confident that you would hire those skills for that position again, it\u2019s time to re-evaluate either the value of that role, or your employee\u2019s performance.</p><p><i>Note: I am not advocating for letting employees go without good reason; in the case of a job not being necessary any more, those employee resources can be redistributed to be more effective parts of the organization; it\u2019s often highly effective to repurpose people that are already familiar with the organization than hiring an \u201cunknown\u201d new employee.</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Rent what can be rented</strong></p><p>For smaller organizations, there is absolutely no need for you to hire staff with all the various talent areas needed to run an organization efficiently. Find marketing experts, outsourced CFOs and bookkeepers, HR consultants, IT support, legal advice and business/strategic/leadership coaches. You\u2019ll get a lot more value without the overhead of having a heavily specialized staff.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Let go of the idea of getting your money\u2019s worth. Be quick to admit mistakes. They help you grow.</strong></p><p>No organization ever makes only the right investments. In fact, the most successful organizations have made significant mistakes. The difference between the organizations that succeed and those that don\u2019t can often be traced to their willingness to try new things and pivot when they fail. Mistakes are a natural part of growth. No matter how much research you put into making decisions, sometimes they just don\u2019t work out like we\u2019ve expected.&nbsp;</p><p>Whether it\u2019s a wrong hire or software implementation, or a new program that failed, take the initiative to make sure that you let go of things that aren\u2019t benefiting you. Staying on a path that isn\u2019t helpful for you just because you\u2019ve invested time and money into it is a sunk-cost fallacy (that\u2019s when people are hesitant to abandon a path they\u2019ve chosen because they\u2019ve invested heavily into it, even when it is clear that abandonment would be beneficial). Once you\u2019ve spent the money, you can\u2019t get it back, but that doesn\u2019t mean you need to lose out from that bad choice anymore.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>4. Discarding memorabilia is not the same as discarding memories.</strong></p><p>How many things do you do \u201cbecause that\u2019s the way we always did it?\u201d Change is not bad \u2013 but it can be hard for people to let go of old ways. Sometimes people are hesitant to effect change because of a sentimental attachment to the work of prior employees, or fear of making someone feel bad.</p><p>You can recognize previous efforts and contributions as necessary and valuable, but still move forward to adapt your operations to new methodologies that are more effective.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>5. Sometimes, it\u2019s more efficient to not be optimized.</strong></p><p>We all have limits to our brain and processing capacity. The more complicated something gets, it creates both less room and more potential for error and consumes more overhead resources. Keeping things simple \u2013 even if it\u2019s not the fastest \u2013 can often reduce potential for error, increase accuracy, and consume less management and overhead resources, making it overall more efficient. Applying this perspective depends heavily on the nuances of each situation, but very often, sometimes less is truly more.</p><p>I hope this gives you a moment to pause and reflect on your organizational structure to keep it free of \u201cclutter\u201d and keep you focused on achieving your ideal organizational impact with the least amount of stress.</p><p>I'd love any comments with examples of this helped your organization - hopefully it can help others if you share.</p><p><i>Giving credit where credit is due: Much of this was inspired by \u201cThe New Japanese Minimalism\u201d, by Fumio Sasaki.</i></p>", "user": {"username": "Deena Englander"}}, {"_id": "qpqab3LwmA6yBFJCk", "title": "The EA Animal Welfare Fund (Once Again) Has Significant Room For More Funding", "postedAt": "2023-11-20T22:02:52.821Z", "htmlBody": "<p>Just as<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/fedieSutmLttCAEvW/the-ea-animal-welfare-fund-has-significant-room-for-more\"><u>~2 years ago</u></a>,&nbsp; the EA Animal Welfare Fund has significant room for more funding. This could be a pretty important point that informs end of year giving for a number of donors who are looking to make donations within the animal sector.&nbsp;</p><p>Briefly, here\u2019s why the Animal Welfare Fund has some pretty significant room for more funding at this point:</p><ul><li>Right now, there\u2019s currently<a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/funds/animal-welfare\"><u> ~$1M in the Animal Welfare Fund</u></a>.&nbsp;</li><li>We also now have 50 grants, summing to ~$4.5M in grants under evaluation.</li><li>Between mid-last year and mid-this year, the EA AWF received ~350 applications over the past year of which ~150 were desk rejects and ~200 were graded by fund managers. Of these ~200, ~60 received funding, and ~30 received the grant amount they applied for or more.&nbsp;</li><li>Assuming that the general shape of the pipeline remains similar, that could imply we may now have more grants than we can fund. Potentially even if we were to have an influx of several hundred thousand dollars.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>In general, the AWF is navigating a difficult period funding-wise: last year, we had ~$7M to allocate, whereas&nbsp;<a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/stats/payouts\"><u>our projection</u></a> for this year \u2014 extrapolating from donations received so far \u2014 is only ~$5M.</li><li>We also have some plans for significant growth next year through some internal expansion plans in the works (e.g., possibly adding further fund managers, hopefully at least one who is full-time, and doing more active grantmaking).&nbsp;</li><li>Also, a lot of our grantees have grown, so they\u2019ll have more room for funding. As a lot of the groups we give to are relatively small, they can grow at such a rate that they\u2019d often be looking to absorb twice as much funding in the next year. If we zoom in on just say F\u00f3rum Nacional de Prote\u00e7\u00e3o e Defesa Animal\u2013a promising Brazilian group. In 2021 we granted $30k to them and this year $80k. Which comfortably corresponds to a greater than 100% growth in grant amount over a two-year period. Generally, it seems that if we have more money in the fund, it encourages some good organizations to request more funding for some quality projects.</li><li>Relatedly, some of the areas we grant in just tend to be pretty high growth and grow at comfortably &gt;20% year on year. For instance, years ago there was basically very little that could be granted to invertebrate welfare, but this year we made several hundred thousand dollars in grants within that area.&nbsp;</li><li>So next year, we think that we could fairly comfortably and productively absorb and grant out in the realm of $6M-$10M (that\u2019s a ~20%-100% increase on this year) without any significant decreases to the quality of our grants.</li><li>Note too, that in previous years we have been able to do such jumps in grantmaking volume. In 2020 we granted out ~$2M in total, in 2021 more than doubled that to ~$4.5M, and in 2022 went up to $7M, before now likely decreasing to ~$5M this year. We think we\u2019re again on track to handle 2020-2022 levels of either absolute growth or percentage growth in grants for next year, which will put us in that $6M-$10M range.</li><li>So one way to look at this is that we now have ~$1M in the fund but next year we could do something like at least ~$7.5M in grants. So in that sense, we have several million dollars in room for more funding.</li><li>It could be worth thinking about how much we\u2019ll likely raise for grants for next year too though. This year,<a href=\"https://funds.effectivealtruism.org/stats/donations/fund\"><u> we typically raised ~$100k per month</u></a>. Historically, we have seen about a ~2x-8x increase on that monthly total for the month of December and January (some end-of-year donations come in on the books in January).</li><li>Another way to look at this then, is based on the current trends and growth in them year to year, we would now be looking at raising something like ~$1.7M (~$100k per month + say ~4x that total for Dec and ~3x for Jan) between now and the end of next year (presuming trends hold about the same as other years, and we don't see too much of a reason to think they won't at this point). Again, as we have ~$1M now in the fund, that brings the total to ~$2.7M. But we think we could productively absorb at least several million dollars on top of that relatively comfortably.</li><li>Also in terms of how much we will raise, we will flag there\u2019s some significant variance in that year to year. Because some notable supporters tend to give amounts that fluctuate quite a bit year to year, because their giving potential tends to be tied to some relatively volatile Cryptocurrencies. Correspondingly, we had something of an influx in $\u2019s at the end of 2017/ start of 2018, when the crypto market boomed, then somewhat of a quieter year on that front in 2019 and 2020, but then again some large donations in 2021 and 2022. It\u2019s pretty unclear to me what to expect from Crypto next year.</li></ul><p><br>So putting those above bullets together, our sense is that&nbsp;<strong>the Animal Welfare Fund has significant room for more funding.</strong> At least a couple hundred thousand dollars in room for more funding, quite credibly a couple of million dollars in room for more funding, and potentially several million dollars in room for more funding for grants next year.&nbsp;</p><h1>What Does a Marginal Grant at AWF Look Like?&nbsp;</h1><p>We ranked grantee applications from the past 12 months, and then modified and blended grants to form representative fictitious grants based on brief descriptions.

I will also try to answer questions in the comments.</p><h1>The basic case for CEA</h1><p>Community building is sometimes motivated by the following: suppose you spent a year telling everyone you know about EA and getting them excited. Probably you could get at least one person excited. Then this means that you will have doubled your lifetime impact, as both you and this other person will go on to do good things. That\u2019s a pretty good ROI for one year of work!</p><p>This story is overly simplistic, but is roughly my motivation for working on (and donating to) community building: it's a leveraged way to do good in the world.</p><p>And it does seem to be the case that many people whose work seems impactful attribute some of their impact to CEA:</p><ol><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/3vMLkWHy5m3xvLrdk/open-phil-ea-lt-survey-2020-what-helped-and-hindered-our%23Influence_Tiers__by_impact_\"><u>The Open Philanthropy longtermist survey</u></a>&nbsp;in 2020&nbsp;identified CEA among the top tier of important influences on people\u2019s journey towards work improving the long-term future, with about half of CEA's demonstrated value coming through events (EA Global and EAGx conferences) and half through our other programs.</li><li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/18UqC_mX1h3HfbqeWGEChjZBiSbdqLJyb1uCEikkxUXc/edit?usp%3Dsharing\"><u>The 80,000 Hours user survey</u></a>&nbsp;in 2022 identified CEA as the EA-related resource which has influenced the most people\u2019s career plans (in addition to 80k itself), with 64% citing the EA Forum as influential&nbsp;and 44% citing EAG.</li><li><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vn4StPK5j9AhZ12ucIih4SXFUCUVkdVatb34PoKtkGI/edit?usp%3Dsharing\"><u>This selection of impact stories</u></a>&nbsp;illustrates some of the ways we\u2019ve helped people increase their impact by providing high-quality discussion spaces to consider their ideas, values and options for and about making impact, and connecting them to advisors, experts and employers.

I'm ~80% confident that OP\u2019s GCRCB program will fund us at roughly similar levels in 2024 as they did in 2023, meaning that where marginal funding on top of OP goes today is likely to be fairly similar to where it would go next year.</p><p>Therefore, I expect marginal funding that we raise from other donors (i.e. you) to most likely go to the following:</p><ul><li>Community Building Grants: We would be interested in funding an organizer in Boston but currently don't have the budget. (Approx cost: $110,000).</li><li>Travel grants&nbsp;for EA conference attendees. Many of the people we would like to attend our conferences are financially unable to do so; giving them some money to cover travel and accommodation ($350 average for EAGx, $1,100 on average for EAG) can result in them attending. We estimate that we could spend an additional $295,000/year here before hitting diminishing returns (from people for whom the grant wasn't actually counterfactual, or whose impact we feel will be influenced less by our events).</li><li>EA Forum: I'm unable to succinctly describe the need here, and we will be doing a follow-up post solely devoted to Forum fundraising. But I do want to briefly mention that I would particularly like the Forum to have diverse funding since some of its value comes from hosting <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/topics/criticism-of-work-in-effective-altruism\"><u>criticism</u></a>&nbsp;of \"powerful\" people/organizations. I'm not aware of any instances of donors e.g. pressuring CEA to remove a post that's critical of them, but \"hey can you please be a predominant funder of this thing which is critical of you\" feels like an uncomfortable pitch to have to make.</li></ul><p>We are raising unrestricted funds, but if one of these projects (or something else) seems substantially more cost-effective to you than the others, I would be interested to hear that.

We've done our best to make them impartial, but you may wish to consider the origin of the models when evaluating them.</p><h2>General thoughts</h2><p>Here are some general points you may wish to consider, beyond the BOTECs:</p><ol><li>If you generally agree with the priorities of major EA donors, and know about projects that they would like to fund but can't for COI, PR, or other reasons, you might want to donate to those instead of CEA. (Similarly to how, if you and an acquaintance&nbsp;both wanted to donate to a certain kind of project, and only you could donate to the US-based charities because you were American, it might make sense for you to ignore the non-US-based charities.) &nbsp;</li><li>If you <i>disagree</i>&nbsp;with the priorities of major EA donors (notably, if you want CEA to be less GCR-focused than OP\u2019s GCRCB team), you may wish to donate to CEA to preserve funder diversity.<ol><li>OP has never, to my knowledge, asked CEA to stop doing something because it wasn't GCR-focused enough, but they have declined to fund activities which are not GCR-focused enough, which de facto means that CEA will not do those things unless we get outside funding. However, it feels really hard for me to predict what OP will want to fund next year, so I hesitate to make this pitch very strongly, but it is something you may consider.</li></ol></li><li>You may also care about funder diversity for other reasons: limiting the COI that CEA has when e.g. hosting criticism of OP, or increased robustness to funding shocks that affect OP.</li><li>If you think there are economies of scale, you might want to donate to CEA (as one of the larger community building organizations). Conversely, if you think there are diminishing returns, you might want to donate to something like <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/PAco5oG579k2qzrh9/ltff-and-eaif-are-unusually-funding-constrained-right-now\"><u>EAIF</u></a>&nbsp;or <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/5WLGmCg7vSfXeqSWC/launching-the-meta-charity-funding-circle-mcf-apply-for\"><u>MCF</u></a>.<ol><li><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/P55P4YJoncfQmZ2RR/downsides-of-small-organizations-in-ea\"><u>This post</u></a>&nbsp;makes the argument in favor of larger organizations; I can\u2019t find a post that precisely argues in favor of the opposite, but <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/DdSszj5NXk45MhQoq/decision-making-and-decentralisation-in-ea\"><u>this</u></a>&nbsp;kind of points in that direction.</li></ol></li></ol><h1>Next steps</h1><ul><li>You can donate to CEA <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/en-US/charities/centre-for-effective-altruism\"><u>here</u></a></li><li>Or email me at <a href=\"mailto:ben.west@centreforeffectivealtruism.org\"><u>ben.west@centreforeffectivealtruism.org</u></a></li><li>Or comment any questions you have below</li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnqvmwzae1o3f\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefqvmwzae1o3f\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;At the time of writing: last updated 13 November.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnxucnl3r9tw\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefxucnl3r9tw\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;We also expect that our budget will change during the year: we have a midyear budget update process, and we may update our spending plans before then depending on the timing of a new CEO being in office and the success of our fundraising efforts.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnn0maef74nva\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefn0maef74nva\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;Open Phil\u2019s GCRCB program tries not to fund more than their \"fair share\" of organizations like CEA; this year it was 80%, and my understanding is that the future amount has not been decided but will depend on the amount of funding elsewhere in the meta GCR reduction ecosystem.</p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnkekqwhwqhc\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefkekqwhwqhc\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;I've heard some feedback from people that understanding the squiggle code can become complicated if you haven't done it before; Ozzie Gooen, one of the creators of squiggle, suggested <a href=\"https://discord.com/invite/nsTnQTgtG6\"><u>joining the discord</u></a>&nbsp;and said that they would be happy to help answer any questions people may have.</p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "Ben_West"}}, {"_id": "n3opkWwu6suxP6qf9", "title": "Open Philanthropy\u2019s newest focus area: Global Public Health Policy", "postedAt": "2023-11-20T20:47:00.280Z", "htmlBody": "<p>We\u2019re pleased to announce that we\u2019ve added a new cause area to our Global Health and Wellbeing portfolio:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/focus/global-public-health-policy/\"><u>Global Public Health Policy</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The program will be overseen by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/santosh-harish/\"><u>Santosh Harish</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/chris-smith/\"><u>Chris Smith</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/about/team/james-snowden/\"><u>James Snowden</u></a>.

", "postedAt": "2023-11-20T20:43:57.214Z", "htmlBody": "<p><a href=\"https://gfi.org/\"><u>The Good Food Institute</u></a> is a non-profit think tank helping to build a more sustainable, secure and just food system by transforming meat production. We work with scientists, businesses and policymakers to advance plant-based and cultivated meat and precision-fermented food \u2013 making these alternative proteins delicious, affordable and accessible. By making meat from plants and cultivating it from cells, we can reduce the environmental impact of our food system and address the welfare of animals in industrial animal agriculture. Founded on effective altruism principles, GFI identifies and advances high-impact, achievable solutions in areas where too few people are working. We focus on what is needed most and provide the talent and resources necessary to have the biggest impact possible.&nbsp;</p><p>GFI is a global network of six organisations focused on one vision: creating a world where alternative proteins are no longer alternative. We are powered by philanthropy and we are currently fundraising to seed our collective 2024 budget, with a gap to goal of $12.7 million, as of today. Within that, GFI Europe has a funding gap of 1.5million EUR that will allow us to have substantial additional counterfactual impact in 2024.</p><p><a href=\"https://gfieurope.org/\"><u>The Good Food Institute Europe</u></a> (GFI Europe) is an affiliate of the Good Food Institute and&nbsp; has been identified as a priority area for GFI\u2019s growth over the next couple of years. As Senior Philanthropy Manager for GFI Europe, in response to <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/xourt4HttDM5QcHsk\">this post</a>, I thought it would be helpful to expand upon why this is the case and to use GFI Europe as an&nbsp;<i>example&nbsp;</i>of how we would leverage marginal increases in funding to generate as much impact as possible in this region, and by extension, globally.</p><p>While I am shining a light on GFI Europe in this post,&nbsp;in&nbsp;<i>every&nbsp;</i>region where we operate, our global teams identify and advance good food solutions. All of our growth is carefully planned to ensure that we can have the greatest possible impact on the ecosystem as a whole.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Why expansion in Europe is an urgent priority for GFI</strong></p><p>GFI\u2019s global priority is to unlock&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.climateworks.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/GINAs-Protein-Diversity.pdf\"><u>$10.1billion in public funding for alternative proteins</u></a> ($4.4bn for R&amp;D; $5.7 towards commercialisation), $1.5 billion of which we believe could come from Europe. Each additional hire, most directly in our Policy and Science &amp; Technology teams, increases the likelihood of unlocking this funding, especially if equipped with evidence and research in support of the benefits and feasibility of alternative proteins.&nbsp;<strong>In other words, each marginal increase in funding for GFI Europe has the potential to leverage much greater sums in R&amp;D funding.&nbsp;</strong>Unlocking R&amp;D funding is on the critical path for plant-based and cultivated meat to reach taste and price parity and to become the default choice for consumers, so is an urgent priority.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to this, political opposition in Europe presents a particular - and, arguably, existential - risk to alternative proteins. The risk to a more sustainable and just future of food is not simply that the potential funding fails to be unlocked, but that political opponents could derail attempts to achieve regulatory approval for novel alternative proteins. With applications for regulatory approval of cultivated meat&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gfieurope.org/blog/aleph-farms-make-europes-first-cultivated-meat-approval-submission-to-swiss-regulators/\"><u>beginning to appear</u></a> on the horizon and countries considering their climate and food strategies, now is a critical time to ensure that we can take advantage of opportunities and mitigate risks. Indeed, with alternative proteins firmly on the policy agenda, and decision-makers trying to make up their minds about what position to take on them,&nbsp;<strong>the next few years are likely to set the course for decades to come for alternative proteins in Europe.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>In such a neglected space, GFI Europe\u2019s ability to track and respond adequately to existential hurdles for alternative proteins is crucial to their success.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>How GFI Europe would spend marginal increases in funding</strong></p><p>GFI Europe would spend marginal increases in available funding on two main categories - additional staffing capacity, and research projects which respond to specific gaps and needs of stakeholders on the critical path for alternative protein adoption. Below, I have expanded on this to illustrate the difference an uplift of 1.5m EUR to our 2024 budget would make for each programmatic team in GFI Europe, compared to the budget remaining the same as it was in 2023, as well as what we would do with marginal funding above this level<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1yml86xxg6c\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1yml86xxg6c\">[1]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Team growth&nbsp;</strong></p><p>We have already seen coordinated and well-funded opposition to alternative proteins in countries such as Italy, France, and Romania. To identify, mitigate and counter such opposition most effectively, GFI Europe\u2019s policy team urgently needs increased capacity. Specifically, we need eyes, ears and a voice on the ground at a national level in as many European countries as possible, as well as the general capacity to be responsive to opportunities and risks in countries where we do not yet have a presence. An example of the impact of this model is in Italy where, in the face of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gfieurope.org/blog/italy-ban-on-cultivated-meat-cuts-itself-off-from-innovation-and-blocks-sustainable-development/\"><u>bill banning cultivated meat</u></a>, GFI\u2019s political engagement has helped pave the way to establish a mechanism for periodically reviewing the necessity and proportionality of the law in light of the available scientific literature.</p><p>Team members based in and with expertise in specific European countries will also be more attuned to and able to respond to positive opportunities as they arise, such as funding calls or relevant government strategies. They will also have the networks and language skills to build local coalitions of allies for alternative proteins which leverage our influence and reach further. For example, our two-person team in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gfieurope.org/deutschland/\"><u>Germany</u></a> has engaged with the country\u2019s Bioeconomy Strategy and National Food Strategy, gained force-multiplying positive media coverage for alternative proteins, and published the first&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gfieurope.org/state-of-the-industry-germany-2023/\"><u>State of the Industry report</u></a> for alternative proteins in Germany, which contains 15 actionable policy recommendations. Just this week, the Budget Committee of the German Bundestag announced&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gfieurope.org/blog/federal-budget-2024-germany-invests-38-million-euros-in-the-protein-transition-and-sets-out-to-become-a-leader-in-the-field/\"><u>\u20ac38 million in funding in 2024</u></a> for the sustainable protein transition - an initiative which GFI Europe&nbsp;actively helped to shape and initiate.&nbsp;</p><p>Replicating this model in other promising countries would help unlock some of the 80% of research funding in Europe which is awarded at the national level. It is also important to be able to mobilise countries that champion alternative proteins, for example Denmark, to counter countries where there\u2019s opposition. The potential impact of even one team member per country represents a high return on philanthropic investment, considering the influence and funding they could unlock.&nbsp;</p><p>The impact of the national-level policy team members would be significantly enhanced by a corresponding additional member of the communications team working closely alongside them to maximise media coverage relating to their work. For example, in-country communications capacity can elevate policy reports, like Germany\u2019s State of the Industry report or the UK\u2019s ecosystem review, leading to proactive outreach from policymakers as well as increased responsiveness to our own lobbying efforts.&nbsp;</p><p>Similarly, our Science and Technology (SciTech) team works hand-in-hand with our Policy team with the goal of unlocking $1.5billion in R&amp;D funding for plant-based and cultivated meat. They support conversations with policymakers by explaining the science behind alternative proteins - how they are made and their benefits for climate and health goals. They also ensure that existing funding is unlocked for alternative protein research by working closely with scientists to build proposals in response to funding calls. So far, due to most of our SciTech team happening to be based in the UK, the majority of this work has been either in the UK (<a href=\"https://gfieurope.org/blog/12-million-cultivated-meat-investment-a-seismic-move-for-uk/\"><u>example here</u></a>) or at EU-level (<a href=\"https://gfieurope.org/blog/gfi-and-eit-food-launch-innovation-challenge-to-bring-down-cost-of-cultivating-meat/\"><u>example here</u></a>). With 80% of research funding in Europe available at a national level from governments, there is obvious potential to expand this work geographically and unlock multiples more in funding than the cost of these additional roles.</p><p>Once again, growth in our communications team can help funding opportunities to reach more scientists, building the scientific ecosystem around alternative proteins, and promote the outcome of existing research so that governments see the benefits of investing in research and innovation funding for alternative proteins. The bigger and more geographically diverse the communications team, the wider their reach (and impact) will be.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>If our budget remains unchanged in 2024</strong> (circa 2.5m EUR):</p><ul><li>Our work at a national level would flatline: we would not be able to expand to any other important countries and may have to scale back our existing work in Germany, the UK, Italy (currently a temporary contract, so unlikely to be renewed in this scenario) and Spain, and at an EU-level in Brussels.</li><li>We would not be able to pursue promising new policy workstreams, only to continue our work on funding, regulation, labelling and NGO engagement.</li><li>Our communications work across the continent, publishing relevant press releases and reaching out to journalists, would be reactive but limited.</li><li>Our SciTech work would also flatline: we would continue building the scientific ecosystem and unlocking more funding, but within our current limitations on scale.</li></ul><p><strong>If we raise enough before the end of 2023 to enable our budget to increase to 4m EUR in 2024, we will be able to:</strong></p><ul><li>hire a policy manager to focus on a new high-priority<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsl0lk2zunn\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsl0lk2zunn\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;region of Europe (potentially Scandinavia).</li><li>hire a research manager focused on a new workstream - managing research projects to support our lobbying (further details below).</li><li>hire a policy manager focused on a new workstream of unlocking infrastructure funding for alternative proteins.</li><li>hire a policy officer in Brussels to provide additional capacity to respond to opportunities and threats as they arise.</li><li>hire national-level policy consultants in two additional countries.&nbsp;</li><li>hire a communications assistant to increase general capacity in the communications team.&nbsp;</li><li>hire communications manager for Southern Europe to support our policy manager for Spain.&nbsp;</li><li>hire another regional communications manager to support the policy manager above (potentially Scandinavia).&nbsp;</li><li>create two new roles in our SciTech team focused on unlocking funding and on&nbsp; super-charging the academic ecosystem to enable multiple streams of our scitech work.</li><li>make two new hires in our pan-European Corporate Engagement team to focus on unblocking the neglected and important bottlenecks which are upstream in the supply chain, and to improve how alternative protein companies commercialise.</li></ul><p><strong>Marginal increases in funding above this level would enable:</strong></p><ul><li>Policy work in additional European countries: to achieve a minimum level of coverage<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefa7pg8pdhrk\"><sup><a href=\"#fna7pg8pdhrk\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;in each European country not already accounted for, via hiring national-level consultants or well-coordinated grant-funded partnership work, would cost around 800,000 EUR<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefsqcgvyj8os9\"><sup><a href=\"#fnsqcgvyj8os9\">[4]</a></sup></span>.&nbsp;</li><li>More responsive communications work: either via hiring in multiple countries following the policy team\u2019s model, or hiring additional generalist, flexible roles to respond to opportunities and risks as they arise.</li><li>Our Science and Technology team to grow geographically and in technology-specific expertise: 195,000 EUR would enable us to hire in three more regions of Europe, for example.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></li></ul><p><strong>Research</strong></p><p>GFI Europe\u2019s work is science and evidence-based and research super-charges the work of all our programmatic teams. Having crucial data and evidence on hand to provide to key stakeholders and decision-makers, whether in the public or private domain, makes success more likely. Increasing the amount of research we can undertake is therefore the other main way we would leverage increased funding to create impact.</p><p>With an increased budget, our policy team would develop a new workstream focused on research in support of our lobbying goals. The research we would like to conduct is informed by questions that our policy team receives time and time again from policymakers who are positively inclined towards alternative proteins but feel there are evidence gaps to fill prior to making significant funding or policy decisions.</p><p>In 2023, we were able to commission one such project focused on the land use benefits of alternative proteins. It answers questions about how much land would be freed up under different scenarios, depending on to what extent alternative proteins displaced conventional animal meat. The report is due to be published in early 2024, but already the hook provided by this new data is unlocking engagement with policymakers across Europe and enabling us to shape conversations positively. We therefore believe further research into other key questions will supercharge our lobbying. We require increased funding not only for commissioning the research itself, but also to hire a dedicated research manager to oversee this workstream.&nbsp;</p><p>So, too, are detailed analyses a priority for our corporate engagement team. In 2023, we published&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gfieurope.org/market-insights-on-european-plant-based-sales-2020-2022/\"><u>retail sales data for plant-based sales in Europe</u></a> for the first time. The data and invaluable insights in these reports have helped to maintain confidence in alternative proteins among leaders in the private sector, in the face of some negative narratives about plant-based sales in Europe. This information has also been critical in our communications work, providing us with evidence-based insights that can push back against negative media narratives.</p><p><strong>If our budget remains unchanged in 2024</strong> (circa 2.5m EUR), we will be able to again publish updated retail sales data. We will also be able to conduct infrastructure investment analysis - a priority, in order to best equip our incoming infrastructure investment manager with the data they need to support their role. We will not be able to expand our policy work to include a research workstream under this budget scenario.</p><p><strong>If we raise enough before the end of 2023 to enable our budget to increase to 4m EUR in 2024, we will be able to:</strong></p><ul><li>commission research to answer the question,&nbsp;<i>What can governments do to facilitate a just transition to alt proteins?&nbsp;</i>- this would not only help to ensure a just transition, but would equip our policy team with answers to a key concern of policymakers.&nbsp;</li><li>develop an alternative proteins policy plan for two priority countries - this would support the lobbying work of our in-country policy managers by mapping the alternative protein ecosystem in each country and identifying the country\u2019s comparative advantage in the alternative protein space, evidencing the benefits of alternative proteins for that country, and making concrete policy recommendations which can be adopted by the government.</li><li>draw out business models for farmers who want to transition to alternative proteins, helping with a just transition.</li></ul><p><strong>Marginal increases in funding above this level&nbsp;</strong>(at a rate of roughly 50,000 EUR per project on average) would enable us to undertake further research projects in support of our programmatic work, including:</p><ul><li>commission research to provide evidence to the question,&nbsp;<i>do alternative proteins displace conventional meat in the marketplace or would they do so if taste and price markers were met?</i>&nbsp; - this would help prove to governments that investing in alternative proteins will help them to meet their climate and health targets.</li><li>analytical reports to solve a particular scientific knowledge gap in alternative protein R&amp;D.</li><li>bibliometric and topic modelling to understand trends in scientific research in Europe, and what is being neglected - this will inform how we can most effectively spend future resources (time and money).</li><li>consultancy to build a roadmap of scientific milestones to taste and price parity, using other fields/sectors as a comparison.</li></ul><p><br><strong>Summary&nbsp;</strong></p><p>GFI has grown significantly since our early days, in great part thanks to the gift support of those in the Effective Altruism community.</p><p>Within this context, GFI Europe is very much still in the \u2018start-up\u2019 phase of growth. I hope to have demonstrated above that there is an urgent and important need for growth in Europe and marginal increases in funding can make a tangible difference to what we can achieve. Our room for more funding and impactful programs have been validated across cause areas, by evaluators and advisers such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://animalcharityevaluators.org/charity-review/the-good-food-institute/\"><u>Animal Charity Evaluators</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.founderspledge.com/research/good-food-institute\"><u>Founder\u2019s Pledge</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givinggreen.earth/mitigation-research/good-food-institute%3A-recommendation\"><u>Giving Green</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://effektiv-spenden.org/the-good-food-institute/\"><u>Effectiv Spenden</u></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://doneereffectief.nl/toporganisatie/the-good-food-institute/\"><u>Doneer Effectief</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.charitynavigator.org/ein/810840578\"><u>Charity Navigator</u></a>.</p><p>Each additional role or research project meets an important, neglected and tractable need on the path to our overall mission to make alternative proteins the default choice. Therefore, every marginal increase in funding represents further advancement of plant-based and cultivated meat and reduced farmed animal suffering and mitigating climate change, pandemic risk, antibiotic resistance.</p><p>If you have questions on any of the above, please feel free to email me, and if this has motivated you to support GFI or GFI Europe specifically, you can make a gift&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gfi.org/harnessing-the-power-of-our-global-community/\"><u>here</u></a> or please reach out to me at europe[hyphen]philanthropy[at]gfi[dot]org.

The events of October 7 have created conditions for major institutional reforms that can break the constitutional impasse of the latest years. That window of opportunity is inevitably short.&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>This note aims to summarize the specific role of the High Courts in modern democracy, and point out that the problem of their composition is relatively simple: a combination of merit and sortision makes possible to choose High Courts adapted to their limited but vital functions. Apart from the israeli case, that ultimately is one of physical life or death, in this age of polarization the role of the High Courts is more vital than ever for the survival of democracy.</i></p><h1>Introduction: sortition in a representative democracy</h1><p>Although the election of public offices by lot was previous to the election by vote and Aristotle considers it the properly democratic selection mechanism (for him election was mostly related to aristocratic regimes), apart from the jury, modern democracies resort to this method of selection on rare occasions.&nbsp;</p><p>Modern democracies, unlike the ancient republics (where civil participation always was limited to the residents in the capital city) have been able extend over large territories based on the representative principle <a href=\"#_ftn1\">[1]</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Sortision is a natural mechanism in the restricted franchise regime of the ancient republics. Joshia Ober describes in \u201c<a href=\"https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691146249/democracy-and-knowledge\">Democracy and Knowledge</a>\u201d how the Athenian system implied a long political career in which a large part of the population took part, and where the election for various positions was progressive and involved a costly learning process. In our time, where citizenship is universal, that degree of political commitment (which among the Athenians mainly affected the men of the property-owning class), would have to be required of the participants in an assembly chosen by lot (that is, preventively to all the population since everyone would be eligible), but with the aggravating factor that in our time policy design involves more complex decisions than in Athens and depends on an incomparably more extensive knowledge base.</p><p>On the other hand, the representative system is based on the existence of an organized civil society. The society that the bourgeois-democratic revolutionaries inherited from their nobiliary predecessors (unlike the ancient polis) assumes the need for intermediate associations and institutional pluralism. In \u201c<a href=\"https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/violence-and-social-orders/F0EA15A67E790214408A7485DBC70F0D\">Violence and Social Orders</a>\u201d it is argued that the associative freedom (whether for profit or for public action) defines more than any other characteristic the modern democracy. Only the existence of intermediate organizations representing sectoral interests, allows for representative political systems, and provides a framework for mass democracy. Above all, modern politics is a competition among political specialists in integrating the preferences of self-organized groups into collective action. This is the core difference between <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Liberty_of_Ancients_Compared_with_that_of_Moderns\">the liberty of moderns and that of the ancients</a>.</p><p>Recently the <a href=\"https://www.ft.com/content/81b94348-c915-4b3c-a9b2-8a26d71bb4c9\">creation of citizen assemblies</a> based on <a href=\"https://www.sortitionfoundation.org/\">random selection</a> has been proposed to replace or complement the elective branch of the Legislative power. In my view a citizen Assembly chosen by lottery would be blatantly ineffective and would be captured by its technical support bureaucracy. It would be also in a permanent conflict with the far more professional and well connected representative legislature chosen by vote. The representative principle and modern democracy are incompatible with the mechanism of sortision.</p><h1>Sortition and the Veil of Ignorance</h1><p>However, for human groups with a homogeneous degree of knowledge and a common training (that eases communication and the division of intellectual labor) the lottery is the best tool to achieve <i>homogeneous, replicable and impartial decisions</i>. Both the ancient Romans and John Rawls represent justice behind a <a href=\"https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/original-position/\"><i>veil of ignorance</i></a>: the just decision is one that does not depend on proper names or special circumstances, but on the application of general laws and principles to the particular case.</p><p>The first step to avoid the corruption of a court or committee is that those potentially investigated do not a priori know its composition.&nbsp;</p><h1>Choosing the High Courts: judicial career and lottery</h1><p>Although there is a clear tension between democracy and legality, in practice, democracy depends on an institutional infrastructure that channels the popular will into political action. Pure democracy, not restricted by checks and balances, is doomed to \u201c<i>one man, one vote, once</i>\u201d: dozens of colonial independences in the XX<sup>th</sup> century empirically support the obvious argument that the government can use its present electoral victory to block any future political alternation. Apparent exceptions, as the all-powerful Westminster Parliament are not so exceptional: the Parliament power was limited until the XIX by the role of the Crown, and in all times by the existence of a close knit oligarchy (first nobiliary, now bourgeois) and an apolitical Army and Civil Service. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>In modern democracies the High Courts are charged with the protection of the machinery of political alternation. Even their role as guarantors of Human Rights is mainly a consequence of the fact that these personal immunities are critical for the workings of the political system.&nbsp;</p><p>In the classic case of the United States the Supreme Court is chosen by the President and its members serve for life. This mechanism is reasonably adequate if chance does not cause the Court to be disproportionately renewed in a single Presidency. But in any case, <i>political election of High Courts is always a dangerous form of capture</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>It is clearly preferable to allow the Legislature to establish the criteria for access and promotion in the judicial career. These criteria can be used to select a subset of <i>eligible</i> judges, and <i>members of the Supreme Court shall be chosen by lottery from among that subset</i>. &nbsp;The more mechanical, depoliticized and temporally distant the judicial review is from the moment of the effective choice of the Supreme Court justices, the more secure the constitutional mechanism is.</p><p>As an example, let\u2019s take the following judicial career: access is based on a competitive examination. Promotions depend on the seniority and the congruence of the decisions (and arguments) of the judge with those of her superior courts. In the committees that judge congruence there may be representation (also chosen by lot) of the Legislature plus that of more senior justices.&nbsp;</p><p>The eligible judges for the High Court shall be are an important fraction (between 10 and 25%) of all judges in their last ten years of career. In this stylized example, the points of political intervention in the judicial career are very remote from the final selection for the Court. By adding to this kind of \u201cjudicial career\u201d a lottery among eligible justices, the resulting Supreme Court would be robust and legitimate.</p><p>Of course, what has been said here for the High Courts is equally valid for other panels of experts, which in public and private institutions have to decide on relatively objective issues: public committees, procurement boards, etc. In all of them, meritocratic selection, continuous expert evaluation, and lottery implement both the Rawlsian veil of ignorance and a system of consensus formation.</p><p><a href=\"#_ftnref1\">[1]</a>&nbsp;See \"El problema de la expansi\u00f3n republicana\u201d, Revista de Occidente, ISSN 0034-8635, N\u00ba 493, 2022.

The pump and irrigation hose is subsidized, while the farmers are required to purchase the solar panels at market prices for running the pump.</p><p>Using this subsidy model, we distributed about 800 solar pumping systems to women's groups and small farmers in rural Malawi from June to September 2023. We interviewed a few beneficiaries and we forecast impacts of pump system ownership of roughly $20 to $30 of new, net income generated per $1 of donated subsidy based on preliminary impact estimates that are described in this report:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375746054_Case_Study_Preliminary_Estimates_of_Solar_Irrigation_Pump_Impact_on_Smallholder_Farm_Income_Interviews_with_Eight_Village_Farmers_Mwambo_Traditional_Area_Zomba_District_Malawi\">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/375746054_Case_Study_Preliminary_Estimates_of_Solar_Irrigation_Pump_Impact_on_Smallholder_Farm_Income_Interviews_with_Eight_Village_Farmers_Mwambo_Traditional_Area_Zomba_District_Malawi</a></p><p>For 2024, we will distribute longer irrigation hoses, larger solar panels and longer lasting pumps in order to increase the irrigated area and the net income that can be generated by each pumping system. We will also encourage greater amounts of income generation by encouraging beneficiaries to grow two crop rotations during the dry season each year instead of just one.</p><p>In this way we hope to increase donation impact leverage from the current ~20:1 to a level that is hopefully greater than 50:1.</p><p>Given our experience distributing solar pumps last summer, we can try to roughly estimate a diminishing returns curve given our current distribution constraints.</p><p>Roughly&nbsp; the maximum in EA donations that we think that we could efficiently absorb for 2024 currently is about $400k (i.e. the cost if a full 40-foot container load of pumps and hoses). At that level, I&nbsp; estimate that the marginal impact leverage would likely drop about 10:1 because there would be challenges and costs associated with expanding the distribution network beyond 4000 systems given our current capacity.</p><p>On the other hand, if our donations are less that $100k, then demand for pumps in our current distribution network will exceed supply and we will be focusing much of our effort/bandwidth on further increasing our impact through improvements in our cost efficiency (e.g. by decreasing the subsidy). In that case, we will have bandwidth to increase distribution and customer support efficiencies and perhaps also decrease pump system subsidy levels and reliance on donor funds. Then our hope is that our marginal impact leverage will increase to something closer to 50:1. &nbsp;Thus over the next year, we have diminishing marginal returns as a function of marginal donation volume.</p><p>Note, Open Philanthropy's threshold for impact marginal cost-effectiveness (MCE) is \"<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/our-planned-allocation-to-givewells-recommendations-for-the-next-few-years/\">increasing income for 4 people by ~1% for a year for $1</a>\" which corresponds four \"people-percent-years\" (PPY) of impact per $1.&nbsp;</p><p>Doing a rough interpolation of the above-described endpoints for our $1/capita/day customers, our diminishing returns curve for 2024 might look like the following:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;Donations.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Impact Leverage &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;MCE [PPY/$1 donated]</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; ~$50k.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;--&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;50:1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 13</p><p>&nbsp; ~$150k.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;--&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;40:1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 11</p><p>&nbsp; ~$300k.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;--&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;25:1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7</p><p>&nbsp; ~$400k.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;--&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10:1 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;3</p><p>Note that any donor can monitor the total donations in real time for the project at the donation link above, and donate only if the donations is at a level that corresponds to their impact leverage or MCE target. &nbsp;Our hope is that we will meet the Open Philanthropy threshold of 4 PPY/$1 for any total donation level below $350k, and at low donation levels, we hope to beat the Open Philanthropy MCE threshold by ~4X.&nbsp;</p><p>We know it would be ideal if our estimates could be verified through Randomized Control Trials (RCTs). But unfortunately, we are currently too small and too early in our development to do RCT studies. So how might an enthusiastic, dedicated, but skeptical EA verify our numbers for themselves?&nbsp;</p><p>Well, we encourage any dedicated and serious&nbsp;members of the EA community who are excited by this intervention to contact us and come to Malawi next summer if they are interested in evaluating impact for themselves.

Such a volunteer would help us measure impacts and help us figure out the details of how to most effectively&nbsp; increase impact cost effectiveness to the higher levels (i.e. 50:1) that we aspire to.&nbsp;</p><p>In this way a dedicated and serious EA donor can have the opportunity to try to measure the impact cost-effectiveness themselves and the donor does not have to rely solely on the information that we provide to verify the impact of the EA donation.</p><p>How do I hope we can do our follow-up reporting to the EA community?</p><p>In March, I will try to report back on our estimate of the total pump and hose purchases that were provided by the EA community vs. the non-EA community. &nbsp;Thus at that time we will see marginal EA impact in terms of number of pumps and hoses provided/ordered.</p><p>And then in Sept/October after distributing the pumping systems and semi-randomly visiting and interviewing beneficiaries, I will try to report back on our best forecast of average and marginal impacts. I hope to also provide my best estimate of the marginal donation gap. &nbsp;This gap will be an estimate of the potential unmet need of beneficiaries who were not served because a limited supply of pumps and hoses delivered. &nbsp;This will provide an estimate of the \"opportunity lost\" due to the project not meeting its full potential next summer. &nbsp;We will try to make an estimate of the potential benefit to the marginal unserved beneficiary, so that we can compare that to the diminishing returns forecast provided above. &nbsp;</p><p>Ideally, because we have a clear diminishing returns curve forecast, my hope is that this allows for the 'EA donation market' to set its 'price' for its 'willingness to donate' relative to the impact leverage ratio that we think we can achieve. Then if we can do an ex-post estimate of whether the marginal lost opportunity was close to that price in practice, then we get to see how efficiently the EA donation market is working for a small project like this.&nbsp;</p><p>Thank you for your attention and consideration. I hope the community finds this donation/market/price-discovery impact experiment helpful and interesting.&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Robert Van Buskirk"}}, {"_id": "ivJgAeYYiDSaovPpY", "title": "Dutch AI Safety Coordination Forum: An Experiment", "postedAt": "2023-11-21T16:18:16.354Z", "htmlBody": "<h1>Summary</h1><ul><li>Recently we kicked off the first national coordination forum between EA-adjacent groups focused on AI safety in the Netherlands</li><li>The forum aims to foster collaboration, update on progress, and align on priorities and theory of change</li><li>We focused on updating and prioritisation, so no tangible outcomes yet,&nbsp;</li><li>Goal is to continue the coordination experiment with at least two more monthly meetings</li><li>We identified the following priorities: (1) find solutions for advanced engagement post AI safety fundamentals course, (2) develop a strategy for engaging with established academics, (3) co-organise one national advocacy event, and (4) increase operational capacity</li><li>This article serves as an overview for interested individuals and groups; intended as an initial reference point, anticipating positive developments and tangible outputs in the future</li></ul><h1>Intro</h1><p>In a notable progress for the AI safety landscape in the Netherlands, we recently started an experiment hosting a national coordination forum for field-building and advocacy initiatives.

We decided to experiment with regularly meeting for two quarters to assess the usefulness. Prior to the forum, the different groups had largely sporadic and informal interactions. The growing desire to understand each other's initiatives and explore potential synergies has spurred this coordination effort. We have various university groups that run intro and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://aisafetyfundamentals.com/\"><u>AI Safety Fundamentals</u></a> (AISF) courses independently as well as several advocacy organisations. Generally, people seem excited about growing the AIS field in the Netherlands (NL) and see relatively high engagement in their groups.

Yeah, <strong>I mean, we definitely will be able to create completely autonomous beings with their own goals.</strong></p><p>And it will be very important, especially as these beings become much smarter than humans, it's going to be important to have these beings, the goals of these beings be aligned with our goals.</p><p>What inspires me? I like thinking about the very &nbsp;fundamentals, the basics. What can our systems not do, that humans definitely do? Almost approach it philosophically.<br>Questions like, what is learning?<br>What is experience?<br>What is thinking?<br>How does the brain work?</p><p>I feel that technology is a force of nature. I feel like there is a lot of similarity between technology and biological evolution. It is very easy to understand &nbsp;how biological evolution works, you have mutations, you have natural selections.</p><p>You keep the good ones, the ones that survive and just through this process you are going to have huge complexity in your organisms. We cannot understand how the human body works because we understand evolution, but we understand the process more or less. And I think machine learning is in a similar state right now, especially deep learning, we have a very simple rule that takes the information from the data and puts it into the model, and we just keep repeating this process. And as a result of this process the complexity from the data gets transferred into the complexity of the model. So the resulting model is really complex, and we don't really know exactly how it works you need to investigate, but the algorithm that did it is very simple.</p><p>ChatGPT, maybe you've heard of it, if you haven't then get ready. You describe it as the first spots of rain before a downpour. It's something we just need to be very conscious of, because I agree it is a watershed moment.

The very first AGIs will basically be very, very large data centres. Packed with specialised neural network processors working in parallel. Compact, hot, power-hungry package, consuming like, 10m homes' worth of energy.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You're going to see dramatically more intelligent systems and I think it's highly likely that those systems will have completely astronomical impact on society.</strong><br>&nbsp;</p><p>Will humans actually benefit? And who will benefit and who will not?</p><p><br><strong>The beliefs and desires of the first AGIs will be extremely important and so it's important to programme them correctly.</strong><br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>I think that if this is not done, then the nature of evolution, of natural selection, favour those systems prioritise their own survival above all else.</strong></p><p><br>It's not that it's going to actively hate humans and want to harm them, but it is going to be too powerful, and I think a good analogy would be the way human humans treat animals. It's not we hate animals, I think humans love animals and have a lot of affection for them, but when the time comes to build a highway between two cities, we are not asking the animals for permission we just do it because it's important for us, and I think by default that's the kind of relationship that's going to be between us and AGIs which are truly autonomous and operating on their own behalf.</p><p><br>Many machine learning experts, people who are very knowledgeable and very experienced, have a lot of scepticism about AGI. About when it could happen and about whether it could happen at all. <strong>Right now this is something that just not that many people have realised yet. That the speed of computers for neural networks, for AI, are going to become maybe 100,000 times faster in a small number of years.</strong></p><p><strong>If you have an arms race dynamics between multiple teams trying to build the AGI first, they will have less time make sure that the AGI that they will build will care deeply for humans.</strong></p><p><br><strong>Because the way I imagine it is that there is an avalanche, like there is an avalanche of AGI development.</strong><br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Imagine it, this huge unstoppable force. And I think it's pretty likely the entire surface of the earth will be covered with solar panels and data centres.</strong></p><p><br><strong>Given these kinds of concerns, it will be important that AGI somehow build as a cooperation between multiple countries.</strong></p><p><br><strong>The future is going to be good for the AI regardless.

I spend money on coffees because it makes me happy. I spend money on dinners out because I like to spend time with friends over good food. Thinking about whether every course of action is the best use of my time or money would be overly exhausting, leaving little room for me to be spontaneous (which I know is a privilege in itself).&nbsp;</p><p>In relation to the situation in Gaza, I believe that my involvement in calling for a ceasefire adds to the total amount of good I am trying to do. As an example of an additional behaviour, I have taken 5-10 minutes to call or email my MP/Foreign Minister a few times over the past ~6 weeks, to demand that they call for a ceasefire. I don\u2019t see the counterfactual as spending those 10 minutes on something even more effective, but rather spending time that I would otherwise not be using on anything productive to help others.&nbsp;</p><p>At the very least, I do not believe this makes me less effective than I usually am. I am continuing to donate to the effective charities I donate to as usual, so in that sense I am no less effective than I have been. My work is also aimed at having the most impact I can in my field, so again, in that sense I am no less effective.&nbsp;</p><p><i>I also want to say that it is absolutely heartbreaking, terrifying, and unacceptable that antisemitism and Islamophobia are on the rise. As mentioned, I strongly believe that each life has equal value. I also believe that people are not automatically defined by the decisions of their governments.&nbsp;</i></p><p>This is where I\u2019m coming from.

The team is also making Nightshade open source, which would allow others to tinker with it and make their own versions. The more people use it and make their own versions of it, the more powerful the tool becomes, Zhao says. The data sets for large AI models can consist of billions of images, so the more poisoned images can be scraped into the model, the more damage the technique will cause.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>The full paper is <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13828\">here</a>.

If so, I'm unaware of any public clarification of OP's beliefs on the topic. In the following sections, I attempt to deduce what views OP may hold in order for animal welfare to not dominate in neartermism, and show that such views would be highly peculiar and dubious.&nbsp;<strong>If OP doesn't think animal welfare dominates, I ask them to publicly clarify their views</strong>, so that they can be constructively engaged with.</p><h3>RP's Project Assumptions are Incorrect</h3><p>If OP rejects RP's conclusions, they must reject some combination of RP's project assumptions: utilitarianism, valence symmetry, hedonism, and unitarianism. I don't think OP rejects utilitarianism or valence symmetry, so the following will focus upon OP's possible objections to:</p><ol><li>Hedonism: The view that welfare derives only from happiness and suffering.</li><li>Unitarianism: The view that the moral importance of welfare doesn't depend upon species membership.</li></ol><p>Crucially,&nbsp;<strong>rejecting hedonism is not enough to avoid animal welfare dominating in neartermism</strong>. As Bob Fischer points out, \"Even if hedonic goods and bads (i.e., pleasures and pains) aren't all of welfare, they\u2019re a lot of it. So, probably, the choice of a theory of welfare will only have a modest (less than 10x [i.e. at least 10 % weight for hedonism]) impact on the differences we estimate between humans' and nonhumans' welfare ranges\".<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref1gol7s53m1q\"><sup><a href=\"#fn1gol7s53m1q\">[8]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;One would need to endorse an overwhelmingly non-hedonic theory, and/or an overwhelmingly hierarchical theory, such that the combined views discount&nbsp;<i>three orders of magnitude of animal welfare impact</i>. For example, OP could hold an overwhelmingly non-hedonic view where almost none (0.1%) of the human welfare range comes from pleasure and pain.</p><p>OP could also hold an overwhelmingly hierarchical view where&nbsp;<i>just for being a human</i>, one unit of a human's welfare is considered vastly (1000x) more important than the same amount of welfare in another animal. OP could also hold a combination of less-overwhelming versions of the two, such as 1% of human welfare coming from pleasure/pain and one unit of human welfare being 10x as important as one unit of animal welfare, so long as the combined views discount three orders of magnitude of animal welfare impact.</p><p>The following two sections will critique overwhelming non-hedonism and overwhelming hierarchicalism respectively. If the overwhelming views were significantly less overwhelming, my critique would be substantially the same. Therefore, I request that the reader&nbsp;<strong>consider the following critiques to also address whichever combination of less-overwhelming views OP may hold</strong>.</p><h3>Endorsing Overwhelming Non-Hedonism</h3><blockquote><p>We [OP] think that&nbsp;<strong>most plausible arguments for hedonism end up being arguments for the dominance of farm animal welfare</strong>. \u2026 If we updated toward more weight on hedonism, we think the correct implication would be even more work on FAW, rather than work on human mental health.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/bdiDW83SFAsoA4EeB/a-philosophical-review-of-open-philanthropy-s-cause?commentId=b7NFHrfaankovTJCF\"><u>Alexander Berger</u></a></p><p>Alexander has stated that \"Hedonism doesn't seem very compelling to me\".<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefywlo8hmy7ah\"><sup><a href=\"#fnywlo8hmy7ah\">[9]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Overwhelming non-hedonism, combined with the implicit premise that humans are vastly more capable of realizing non-hedonic goods than animals, may explain OP's neartermist cause prioritization: Enabling humans to realize non-hedonic goods may be better than reducing extreme suffering for orders of magnitude more animals.</p><p>The implicit premise seems non-obvious.

To endorse human interventions over animal interventions, the human welfare range under the overwhelmingly non-hedonic view would have to be ~1000x the human welfare range under hedonism. Imagine a world with hundreds of people in extreme hedonic pain (e.g. drowning in lava) but one person with extreme non-hedonic good (e.g. love, knowledge, friendship). The overwhelming non-hedonist would consider this world net good.</p><p>An overwhelmingly non-hedonic view would also be out of step with much of the EA community. A&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/effective.altruists/permalink/3127490440640625/\"><u>poll</u></a> of EAs found that most respondents would give up years of extreme good, whether from hedonic or non-hedonic sources, to avoid a day of extreme hedonic pain (drowning in lava). Nearly a third responded that \"No amount of happiness could compensate\".</p><blockquote><p><strong>I experienced \"disabling\"-level pain for a couple of hours, by choice and with the freedom to stop whenever I want. This was a horrible experience that made everything else seem to not matter at all.</strong></p><p>A single laying hen experiences hundreds of hours of this level of pain during their lifespan, which lasts perhaps a year and a half - and there are as many laying hens alive at any one time as there are humans.&nbsp;<strong>How would I feel if every single human were experiencing hundreds of hours of disabling pain?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>A single broiler chicken experiences fifty hours of this level of pain during their lifespan, which lasts 4-6 weeks. There are 69 billion broilers slaughtered each year.&nbsp;<strong>That is so many hours of pain that if you divided those hours among humanity, each human would experience about 400 hours (2.5 weeks) of disabling pain every year.</strong> Can you imagine if instead of getting, say, your regular fortnight vacation from work or study, you experienced disabling-level pain for a whole 2.5 weeks? And if every human on the planet - me, you, my friends and family and colleagues and the people living in every single country - had that same experience every year? How hard would I work in order to avert suffering that urgent?</p><p><strong>Every single one of those chickens are experiencing pain as awful and all-consuming as I did for tens or hundreds of hours, without choice or the freedom to stop.</strong> They are also experiencing often minutes of 'excruciating'-level pain, which is an intensity that I literally cannot imagine.

The numbers would be even more immense if you consider farmed fish, or farmed shrimp, or farmed insects, or wild animals.</p><p>If there were a political regime or law responsible for this level of pain - which indeed there is - how hard would I work to overturn it?&nbsp;<strong>Surely that would tower well above my other priorities (equality, democracy, freedom, self-expression, and so on), which seem trivial and even borderline ridiculous in comparison.</strong></p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/xtcgsLA2G8bn8vj99/reminding-myself-just-how-awful-pain-can-get-plus-an\"><u>Ren Springlea</u></a></p><h3>Endorsing Overwhelming Hierarchicalism</h3><p>I don't know whether or not OP endorses overwhelming hierarchicalism. However, after overwhelming hedonism, I think overwhelming hierarchicalism is the next most likely crux for OP's rejection of animal welfare dominating in neartermism.</p><p>Many properties of the human condition have been proposed as justifications for valuing one unit of human welfare vastly (1000x) more than one unit of another animal's welfare. For every property I know of that's been proposed, a case can be constructed where a person lacks that property, but we still have the intuition that we shouldn't care much less about them than we do about other people:</p><ul><li>Intelligence: The intelligence of human infants and adult chickens isn't very different, but we should care for infants.</li><li>Capacity for future intelligence: Terminally ill children or people with severe mental disabilities may never be more intelligent than adult pigs, but we should care deeply for these people.</li><li>Species membership: If we learned that Danish people were actually an offshoot of a hominid which wasn't homo sapiens, should we care for them 1000x less than we do other people?</li><li>Capacity for creativity, or speech, or dignity, etc: If a person is uncreative, or mute, or undignified, are they worth 1000x less?</li></ul><p>I personally feel much more empathy for humans than for chickens, and a benefit of believing in overwhelming hierarchicalism would be that I could prioritize helping humans over chickens. It might also make eating meat permissible, which would make life much easier. However, the losses would be real. I'd feel like&nbsp;<strong>I'm compromising on my epistemics by adding an arbitrary line to my moral system which lets me ignore a possible atrocity of immense scale</strong>. I'd be doing this for the sake of the warm fuzzies I'd feel from helping humans, and convenience in eating meat. That's untenable to a mind built the way mine is.</p><h3>It's Strongly Intuitive that Helping Humans &gt; Helping Chickens</h3><p>I agree! But many also find it strongly intuitive that saving a child drowning in front of them is better than donating 10k to AMF, and that atrocities happening right now are more important than whatever may occur billions of years from now. In both of these cases, strong arguments to the contrary have persuaded many EAs to revise their intuitions.</p><p>If the latest and most rigorous research points to cage-free campaigns being 1000x as good as AMF, should a strong intuition to the contrary discount that by three orders of magnitude?</p><h3>Skepticism of Formal Philosophy</h3><p>Though this section has invoked formal philosophy for the purpose of rigor, formal philosophy isn't actually required to make the high-level argument for animal welfare dominating in neartermism:</p><ol><li>If you hurt a chicken, that probably hurts the chicken on the order of \u2153 as much as if you hurt a human similarly.</li><li>Extreme suffering matters enough that reducing it can sometimes be prioritized over cultivating friendship, love, or other goods.&nbsp;</li><li>Reducing an animal's suffering isn't overwhelmingly less important than reducing a human's suffering.</li><li>Therefore, if one's $5000 can either (a) prevent serious suffering for 50,000 hens for 1 year<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefc188z1l56kf\"><sup><a href=\"#fnc188z1l56kf\">[14]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;or (b) enable a single person to realize a lifetime of love and friendship, (a) seems orders of magnitude more cost-effective.</li></ol><p>By analogy, one might be skeptical of many longtermists' use of formal philosophy to justify rejecting temporal discounting, rejecting person-affecting views, and accepting the repugnant conclusion. However, the high-level case for longtermism doesn't require formal philosophy:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/rvvwCcixmEep4RSjg/prioritizing-x-risks-may-require-caring-about-future-people?commentId=Btm5ZZniHxjqdFbqk#Btm5ZZniHxjqdFbqk\"><u>\"I think the human race going extinct would be extra bad, even compared to many billions of deaths\"</u></a>.</p><h2>Even if Animal Welfare Dominates, it Still Shouldn't Receive a Majority of Neartermist Funding</h2><p>Even if OP accepts that animal welfare dominates in neartermism, they may have other reasons for not allocating it a majority of neartermist funding.</p><h3>Worldview Diversification Opposes Majority Allocations to Controversial Cause Areas</h3><p>OP might state that on principle, worldview diversification shouldn\u2019t allow a majority allocation to a controversial cause area. However, in 2017, 2019, and 2021, OP allocated a majority of longtermist funding to AI x-risk reduction.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref701yznznrr9\"><sup><a href=\"#fn701yznznrr9\">[15]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;While OP and I myself think AI x-risk is a major concern, thoughtful people within and outside the EA community disagree. Those who don\u2019t think AI x-risk is a concern may consider nuclear war, pandemics, and/or climate change to be the most pressing x-risks.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefwhhupc0jm6\"><sup><a href=\"#fnwhhupc0jm6\">[16]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Those who think AI x-risk is a concern often regard it as ~10x more pressing than other x-risks. In 2017, 2019, and 2021, OP judged that the 10x importance of AI x-risk reduction, under the controversial view that AI x-risk is a concern, was high enough to warrant a majority of longtermist funding.</p><p>Similarly, thoughtful people within and outside the EA community disagree on whether animals merit moral consideration. If animals do, then the most impactful animal welfare interventions are likely ~1000x as cost-effective as the most impactful alternatives. Just as controversy regarding whether AI x-risk is a concern should not preclude OP allocating AI x-risk a majority of longtermist funding, controversy regarding whether animals merit moral concern should not preclude allocating animal welfare a majority of neartermist funding.</p><h3>OP is Already a Massive Animal Welfare Funder</h3><p>OP is the world\u2019s largest funder in many extremely important and neglected cause areas. However, this should not preclude OP updating its prioritization between those cause areas if given sufficient evidence. For example, if a shocking technological breakthrough shortened TAI forecasts to 2025, even though OP is already the world\u2019s largest funder of AI x-risk reduction, OP would be justified in increasing its allocation to that cause area.</p><h3>Animal Welfare has Faster Diminishing Marginal Returns than Global Health</h3><p>I agree that if OP prematurely allocated a majority of neartermist funding to animal welfare, then the marginal cost-effectiveness of OP's animal welfare grants would drop substantially. Instead, I suggest that OP scale up animal welfare funding over several years to approach a majority of OP's neartermist grantmaking.</p><p>To absorb such funding,&nbsp;<strong>many ambitious animal welfare megaprojects have been&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/gGSQrbNJJCxiMNog3/megaprojects-for-animals\"><strong><u>proposed</u></strong></a>. Even if these megaprojects would be an order of magnitude less cost-effective than corporate chicken campaigns, I've argued above that&nbsp;<strong>they'd likely be far more cost-effective than the best neartermist alternatives</strong>.</p><p>Even so, it seems that OP's Farm Animal Welfare program may&nbsp;<i>currently</i> be able to allocate millions more without an order of magnitude decrease in cost-effectiveness:</p><blockquote><p>Although tens of millions of dollars feels like a lot of money, when you compare it to the scope of the problem it quickly feels like not that much money at all, so we are having to make tradeoffs. Every dollar we give to one project is a dollar we can\u2019t give to another project, and so unfortunately we do have to decline to fund projects that probably could do a lot of good for animals in the world.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/2yelGXLlcOEkJ3NFqT6Lcm?si=7D-jZvQaSK-5qaYjJ2THwg&amp;context=spotify%3Ashow%3A1WErgoXiZwgctkHLzqU6nf\"><u>Amanda Hungerford</u></a>, Program Officer for Farm Animal Welfare for OP (8:12-8:34).</p><h3>Increasing Animal Welfare Funding would Reduce OP\u2019s Influence on Philanthropists</h3><blockquote><p>Over time, we aspire to become the go-to experts on impact-focused giving; to become powerful advocates for this broad idea; and to have an influence on the way many philanthropists make choices. Broadly speaking,&nbsp;<strong>we think our odds of doing this would fall greatly if we were all-in on animal-focused causes</strong>. We would essentially be tying the success of our broad vision for impact-focused philanthropy to a concentrated bet on animal causes (and their idiosyncrasies) in particular. And we\u2019d be giving up many of the practical benefits we listed previously for a more diversified approach. Briefly recapped, these are: (a) being able to provide tangibly useful information to a large set of donors; (b) developing staff capacity to work in many causes in case our best-guess worldview changes over time; (c) using lessons learned in some causes to improve our work in others; (d) presenting an accurate public-facing picture of our values; and (e) increasing the degree to which, over the long run, our expected impact matches our actual impact (which could be beneficial for our own, and others\u2019, ability to evaluate how we\u2019re doing).</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/update-on-cause-prioritization-at-open-philanthropy/\"><u>Holden Karnofsky</u></a></p><p>Though this is unfortunate, it makes sense, and Holden should be trusted here. That said,&nbsp;<strong>there\u2019s a world of difference between being \u201call-in on animal-focused causes\u201d and allocating a majority of OP\u2019s neartermist funding to animal welfare</strong>, while continuing to fund many other important neartermist cause areas. It doesn\u2019t seem to me that the latter proposal runs nearly as much risk of alienating philanthropists. Some evidence of this is that OP is the world\u2019s largest funder of AI x-risk reduction, another niche cause area which few philanthropists are concerned with. In spite of this, OP seems to have maintained its giving capacity. Given the overwhelming case for prioritizing animal welfare in neartermism, OP may be able to communicate its change in cause prioritization in a way which maintains the donor relationships which have done so much good for others.</p><h2>Request for Reasoning Transparency from OP</h2><p>Though I've endeavored to critique whichever views OP may plausibly hold that preclude prioritizing animal welfare in neartermism,&nbsp;<strong>I'm still deeply unsure about what OP's views actually are</strong>. Here are several reasons why OP should clarify their views:</p><ul><li><strong>OP believes in&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/reasoning-transparency/\"><strong><u>reasoning transparency</u></strong></a><strong>, but their reasoning has not been transparent.</strong></li><li>OP's prioritization seems out of step with the mean EA leader.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref6mmmbuu6olu\"><sup><a href=\"#fn6mmmbuu6olu\">[17]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Clarifying OP's view could kindle a conversation which could update OP or other EA leaders.</li><li>The only views I can currently think of where animal welfare wouldn't be prioritized in neartermism (overwhelming non-hedonism or overwhelming hierarchicalism) seem rather dubious. If OP has strong arguments for those views, or OP reveals a plausible alternative view I hadn't thought of, I and many others could be updated.</li><li>Historically, OP's decisionmakers' statements about the moral worth of animals haven't been easy to reconcile. A cohesive statement of OP's view would put this to rest.<ul><li>For example, in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/radical-empathy/\"><u>2017</u></a>, Holden's personal reflections \"indicate against the idea that e.g. chickens merit moral concern\". In&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/update-on-cause-prioritization-at-open-philanthropy/\"><u>2018</u></a>, Holden stated that \"there is presently no evidence base that could reasonably justify high confidence [that] nonhuman animals are not 'conscious' in a morally relevant way\". Did Holden's view change? If so, for what reasons?</li></ul></li></ul><p>It's also possible that OP lacks a formal theory for why animal welfare doesn't dominate in neartermism. As Alexander Berger has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://80000hours.org/podcast/episodes/alexander-berger-improving-global-health-wellbeing-clear-direct-ways/\"><u>said</u></a>, \"I\u2019ve always recognized that my maximand is under-theorized\". If so, it would seem even more important for OP to clarify their view.&nbsp;<strong>If there's a chance that 1 million dollars to corporate campaigns is actually worth 1&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>billion</strong></i><strong> dollars to GiveWell-recommended charities, understanding one's answers to the relevant philosophical questions seems very important.</strong></p><p>Here are some specific questions I request that OP answer:</p><ul><li>How much weight does OP's theory of welfare place on pleasure and pain, as opposed to nonhedonic goods?</li><li>Precisely how much more does OP value one unit of a human's welfare than one unit of another animal's welfare,&nbsp;<i>just because the former is a human</i>? How does OP derive this tradeoff?</li><li>How would OP's views have to change for OP to prioritize animal welfare in neartermism?</li></ul><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>When I started as an EA, I found other EAs' obsession with animal welfare rather strange.&nbsp;<strong>How could these people advocate for helping&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>chickens</strong></i><strong> over children in extreme poverty?</strong> I changed my mind for a few reasons.</p><p>The foremost reason was my realization that my love for another being shouldn't be conditional on any property of the other being. My life is pretty different from the life of an African child in extreme poverty. We likely have different cultural values, and I'd likely disagree with many of the decisions they'll make over their lives. But those differences aren't important\u2014<strong>each and every one of them is a special person whose feelings matter just the same</strong>.</p><p>The second reason was understanding the seriousness of the suffering at stake. When I think about the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://benthams.substack.com/p/factory-farming-delenda-est\"><u>horrors</u></a> animals experience in factory farms, it makes me feel horrible.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>When a quarter million birds are stuffed into a single shed, unable even to flap their wings, when more than a million pigs inhabit a single farm, never once stepping into the light of day,&nbsp;<strong>when every year tens of millions of creatures go to their death without knowing the least measure of human kindness</strong>, it is time to question old assumptions, to ask what we are doing and what spirit drives us on.</p></blockquote><p>Matthew Scully,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dominionmovement.com/watch\"><u>\"Dominion\"</u></a></p><p>Thirdly, I've been asked whether the prospect of helping millions of beings cheapens the value of helping a single being. If I can save hundreds of African children over the course of my life, does each individual child matter proportionally less? Absolutely not. If helping a single being is worth so much, how much more is helping&nbsp;<i>billions</i> of beings worth?&nbsp;<strong>I can't make a difference for billions of beings, but&nbsp;</strong><i><strong>you</strong></i><strong> can</strong>.</p><blockquote><p>We aspire to radical empathy: working hard to extend empathy to everyone it should be extended to, even when it\u2019s unusual or seems strange to do so. As such,&nbsp;<strong>one theme of our work is trying to help populations that many people don\u2019t feel are worth helping at all</strong>.</p></blockquote><p><a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/notable-lessons/\"><u>Holden Karnofsky</u></a></p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnvvgxbog24u\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefvvgxbog24u\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;Simnegar, Ariel (2023). \"Open Phil Grants Analysis\".&nbsp;<a href=\"https://github.com/ariel-simnegar/open-phil-grants-analysis/blob/main/open_phil_grants_analysis.ipynb\"><u>https://github.com/ariel-simnegar/open-phil-grants-analysis/blob/main/open_phil_grants_analysis.ipynb</u></a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnbwf23640uls\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefbwf23640uls\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;Karnofsky, Holden (2016). \"Worldview Diversification\".&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/worldview-diversification/\"><u>https://www.openphilanthropy.org/research/worldview-diversification/</u></a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn173e3rnj9ic\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref173e3rnj9ic\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;Open Philanthropy. \"Rethink Priorities \u2014 Moral Patienthood and Moral Weight Research\".&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/rethink-priorities-moral-patienthood-and-moral-weight-research/\"><u>https://www.openphilanthropy.org/grants/rethink-priorities-moral-patienthood-and-moral-weight-research/</u></a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnjlwupzlr01i\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefjlwupzlr01i\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;\"Our team was composed of three philosophers, two comparative psychologists (one with expertise in birds; another with expertise in cephalopods), two fish welfare researchers, two entomologists, an animal welfare scientist, and a veterinarian.\" Fischer, Bob (2022). \"The Welfare Range Table\".&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/y5n47MfgrKvTLE3pw/p/tnSg6o7crcHFLc395\"><u>https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/y5n47MfgrKvTLE3pw/p/tnSg6o7crcHFLc395</u></a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fna5wqewn0u8p\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefa5wqewn0u8p\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;Grilo, Vasco (2023). \"Prioritising animal welfare over global health and development?\".&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vBcT7i7AkNJ6u9BcQ/prioritising-animal-welfare-over-global-health-and\"><u>https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/vBcT7i7AkNJ6u9BcQ/prioritising-animal-welfare-over-global-health-and</u></a></p></div></li><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnv3krjthxxdg\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefv3krjthxxdg\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>&nbsp;Gertler, Aaron (2019). \"EA Leaders Forum: Survey on EA priorities (data and analysis)\".&nbsp;<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TpoeJ9A2G5Sipxfit/ea-leaders-forum-survey-on-ea-priorities-data-and-analysis\"><u>https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TpoeJ9A2G5Sipxfit/ea-leaders-forum-survey-on-ea-priorities-data-and-analysis</u></a></p><p>For the question \"What (rough) percentage of resources should the EA community devote to the following areas over the next five years\", the mean EA leader answered 10.7% for global health and 9.3% + 3.5% = 12.8% for farm and wild animal welfare respectively.

Using this metric,&nbsp;<strong>we estimate it costs $17 to enhance a person\u2019s well-being by one WELLBY, making it 8x more cost-effective than the benchmark of direct cash transfers.</strong></p><p>If we can meet our 2024 funding goals, we will scale the program and reduce the current cost of $216 per participant closer to the 2024 target of $120 per participant. We expect that this will lead to clinically significant improvements in depression symptoms in 75% of participants.</p><p><i>Note: We created these projections by extrapolating from the CEAs of other organizations using g-IPT, taking into account Vida Plena's projected expenses, the average Ecuadorian household size for spillover effects, the counterfactual treatment gap, and the likelihood of success.&nbsp; For more details about our expected cost-effectiveness at scale,&nbsp;</i><a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/mE68RKHuTymGW4q7N/vida-plena-predictive-cost-effectiveness-analysis\"><i><u>see this forum post.</u></i></a></p><h2><strong>Roadmap for 2024 and Beyond</strong><br><strong><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MFRqdphhyddjgTwX4/whsprdthh5kqvjoqt0yc\"></strong></h2><p>In 2024, Vida Plena is set to extend mental health treatment to 2,000 individuals by incorporating 20 new community facilitators into our dedicated team. An innovative step forward includes piloting a partnership model with private businesses, ensuring their employees have access to vital mental health care through paid collaborations. Our ultimate aim is to reach every corner of Ecuador, particularly in regions currently devoid of such services. We actively seek partnerships with both local and national government entities, aspiring to become essential service partners. Looking ahead, our three-year plan includes the ambitious goal of expanding our impact beyond borders and initiating projects in neighboring countries like Colombia.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>2) Marginal Funding Proposal: Enhancing g-IPT via Behavioral Science</strong></h1><p>The core of this marginal funding project proposal is to continue iterating and improving the most cost-efficient version of g-IPT for scaling throughout Latin America. We expect the current g-IPT model can be improved by integrating behavioral science. Vida Plena aims to enhance engagement and deepen long-term outcomes by employing rapid learning cycles that apply expert insights from behavior design specialists and academic collaborators.&nbsp;</p><p>This project's output will be a comprehensive white paper, detailing findings and processes for improved depression outcomes. Additionally, we aim to build organizational capacity for a large-scale randomized control trial in 2025. With this evidence base, Vida Plena aspires to broad adoption and funding of g-IPT through governmental scaling support.</p><p><strong>Total project funding needed: $202,400</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><i>see&nbsp;the project </i><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1FptZfDChXmpB9npVQzjgHV-sR4dWPi8vkuavUQRuF14/edit\"><i><u>Budget</u></i></a><i> for further details</i></p><h2><strong>Main Project Objectives</strong></h2><ol><li><strong>Objective 1: Identify behavior science techniques and tools to improve participant enrollment and engagement. </strong>This will include the completion of the following steps:<ol><li>Behavior Analysis: Analyze the current enrollment and engagement patterns. Identify bottlenecks or points where participants drop off or disengage.</li><li>Conduct a literature review and consult with experts to identify the most appropriate behavior-driven strategies such as personalization, gamification, social norms, reducing friction, timely reminders, etc.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Objective 2: Rigorously test and evaluate identified techniques and tools to see which leads to better participant outcomes.</strong>&nbsp; Outcome improvements will be measured by:<ol><li>Tracking overall enrollment and per-session attendance to identify potential drop-off points.</li><li>Pre- post-assessments; 3 and 6-month follow-up assessments: Collect data on depression symptoms (PHQ-9), anxiety (GAD-7), post-traumatic stress (PCL-5), subjective well-being, and other relevant indicators before and after the g-IPT treatment to assess how modification of the program using behavior science insights impact these measures.&nbsp; If successful, we will expect to see improvements better than the current baseline measures.</li><li>Participant and therapist qualitative feedback: Gather feedback through surveys, interviews, and focus groups to understand the effectiveness of the modified g-IPT model and gather suggestions for improvement.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li></ol></li><li><strong>Objective 3: Incorporate the most effective behavioral science techniques to create an enhanced version of g-IPT</strong>&nbsp;<ol><li>&nbsp;Timely completion of the white paper documenting project findings including a thorough analysis and clear presentation of insights from behavioral science integration.</li><li>Discussion of scaling implications, presenting challenges and opportunities, and a cost-effectiveness analysis of various interventions</li><li>Evaluation through peer review and expert feedback on quality and implications for scaling up g-IPT.</li></ol></li><li><strong>Objective 4: Develop organizational capacity for Vida Plena to carry out an RCT in 2025. Success will be shown through:</strong><ol><li>Development of Replicable Internal Workflows: Develop clear workflows and processes for different stages of the RCT, from participant recruitment and randomization to data collection and analysis. Ensure that everyone understands their roles and responsibilities.</li><li>Data Management Plan: Develop a robust data management plan that includes data collection tools, data storage protocols, and data quality assurance processes.</li><li>Ensure sufficient participant enrollment: Aiming for a robust sample size to ensure statistically significant results, we will collaborate with academic partners to determine the requisite number of participants.</li></ol></li></ol><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/MFRqdphhyddjgTwX4/wy9tngpsyfqy3l0b1zmc\"><figcaption>Local community members who are trained as group facilitators are the backbone of our impact.</figcaption></figure><h2><strong>Primary Risks to Project Success or Potential Setbacks</strong></h2><p><strong>1. Insufficient data collection:</strong> If the project team does a poor job with data collection, it may hinder the ability to draw meaningful conclusions from the study. To address this issue, the project plans to hire a Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) expert who will oversee data collection and monitoring processes, ensuring the accuracy and completeness of data. We will also consult with academic partners.</p><p><strong>2. Inadequate participant enrollment:</strong> The inability to enroll enough participants for comparison groups could limit the project's statistical power and validity. To mitigate this risk, the project will employ an outreach specialist to establish partnerships with local institutions, enhancing participant recruitment efforts.</p><p><strong>3. Misapplication of behavioral science strategies:</strong> Failure to apply the principles of behavioral science correctly may lead to ineffective interventions and outcomes. To avoid this, the project will collaborate with area experts and academics, ensuring the appropriate design and implementation of behavioral science strategies.</p><h1><strong>3) Additional Funding Opportunites:&nbsp;</strong></h1><p>In addition to the \"Enhancing g-IPT via Behavioral Science\" &nbsp;proposal described above, there are several other ways that Vida Plena could benefit from additional, <a href=\"https://vidaplena.global/support-our-work/\">marginal funding</a>:</p><ul><li><strong>$120 - Individual Support:</strong>&nbsp;<ul><li>Provide comprehensive treatment for one person, covering 9 sessions and ongoing follow-ups.</li></ul></li><li><strong>$800 Monthly / $9,600 Annually - Group Facilitator:</strong>&nbsp;<ul><li>Hiring an additional Community Facilitator will extend care to approximately 400 more individuals, ensuring continued support.</li></ul></li><li><strong>$50,000 - Expansion to New Region:&nbsp;</strong><ul><li>Facilitate our expansion into a new region in Ecuador. This includes the establishment of training and outreach teams, bringing vital mental health care to areas currently underserved and neglected, beyond our current operations in Quito.</li></ul></li></ul><h2><strong>Possible Reasons for Not Funding Vida Plena:</strong></h2><ol><li><strong>Impact Uncertainty:</strong> Our cost-effectiveness figures are projections, lacking local data for a control group (we aim to carry one out in 2025). Although our program's effectiveness is backed by other organizations' RCTs, results come with inherent uncertainties. Additionally, some readers might prefer DALYs over WELLBYs for cost comparisons, and therefore other initiatives will be more cost-effective.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Government Adoption Challenges:</strong> The big-picture scaling plan is to have g-IPT adopted into the national healthcare system. While we are making progress with local entities, national government implementation isn't guaranteed. Still, we believe direct implementation could still be a cost-effective option, especially with diverse funding sources.</li></ol><h2><strong>Reasons to Fund Vida Plena:</strong></h2><ol><li><strong>Sole EA Health Organization in Latin America</strong>: Funding us provides an opportunity to build local credibility and establish a significant foothold in the region.</li><li><strong>Contribution to Treatment Models:</strong> Your funding would contribute to expanding the evidence base for improved treatment models. This not only benefits participants in our programs but also aids thousands globally relying on group interpersonal therapy (g-IPT) programs.</li><li><strong>Path to Self-Sustainability</strong>: Vida Plena is actively moving towards self-sustainability. We are developing a co-payer model with local businesses and securing contracts with development agencies.

My name is Joshua Choi and I\u2019m a 4th year Economics student at UC Berkeley. This semester I\u2019m working on a cost-effectiveness project with the Berkeley EA group. My project is in collaboration with Solar4Africa, a charity that distributes subsidized solar products in rural Malawi and the goal of my particular project is to estimate the cost-effectiveness (CE) of solar pump irrigation systems and determine if it is competitive with other top-level Global Health and Welfare interventions or general EA charity donations. In this post I will cover the following: (1) background on solar pumps, (2) the potential value of solar pumps, and (3) how I will be valuing solar pump cost-effectiveness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Background</strong></p><p>To begin, I will outline the nature of the Solar4Africa solar pump intervention in Malawi. Rural areas in Malawi experience a dry season during which lower-income farmers or women gardening groups are typically unable to provide their crops sufficient water for a large harvest. Many if not most small farmers and women's gardening groups in rural Malawi carry irrigation water by hand. Solar4Africa distributes and subsidizes small solar pump irrigation systems that allow these target groups to utilize the characteristic harsh sunlight of the dry season to power irrigation systems for their crops, providing an opportunity for them to grow a larger area of crops for consumption or sale. Following the intervention, Solar4Africa collected preliminary data on the impact of having solar pumps during the dry season from a non-random sample. With this early data, we can begin to build a picture of the potential benefits of offering these solar pump systems.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Preliminary estimates of cost-effectiveness</strong></p><p>Preliminary data taken from interviews of a non-random sample of 8 beneficiaries indicates that introduction of solar pump irrigation for use during the dry season increases the annual cash income of Malawi farmers and gardening groups by an average of 48%. That being said, this number does have a high variance for different pump owners.&nbsp;</p><p>Currently the system costs approximately $200 and is subsidized approximately $100/pump by philanthropic donors.</p><p>An alternative engineering-based model that estimates income impacts shows that the pumps (which receive a $100 subsidy) may generate anywhere between $300 to $9,500 (90% confidence interval) of new farm income with an expected median value of $2,100. The model assumes 3 to 10 years of solar pump use. Another way of characterizing the cost-effectiveness is to estimate the benefit multiplier&nbsp; which is the total net benefits divided by the pump subsidy. The area irrigated is estimated by measuring the volume of water that is pumped with solar energy against the water requirements for the crop field, and the income is estimated from the expected yield per unit area and the expected gross profit per unit of crop harvested. A Monte Carlo simulation is used to calculate a range of outcomes based on the expected range of input parameters. The model creates a probability distribution that estimates a median benefit multiplier of $21 net benefit per $1 of subsidy for the solar pump.</p><p>One might ask why don\u2019t farmers buy the solar pumps on the market if they are so beneficial? Solar pumps are available on the Malawi market but tend to be at least 5X more expensive than the ones distributed with this project because they are geared to much richer farmers.&nbsp; The smaller, subsidized version is affordable to a much larger number of low-income farmers.&nbsp; This also allows for bulk distribution of the pumping systems which lowers costs.&nbsp;</p><p>Though the cost-effectiveness numbers initially appear promising, it is important to refine the estimates and solidify their validity through more detailed cost-effectiveness analyses. I describe the more detailed cost-effectiveness methodology in the next section.<br>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Proposed cost-effectiveness (CE) Methodology</strong></p><p>The lead organizer of the Solar4Africa charity has posted a proposed CE methodology on the EA forum: \u201c<a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/icxnuEHTXrPapHBQg/a-simplified-cost-effectiveness-estimation-methodology-for\"><u>A simplified cost-effectiveness estimation methodology for use in Solar4Africa\u2019s Fall-23 student projects</u></a>,\u201d the solar pump CE analysis will utilize the following equation:&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>MCI = Cd / NBs</i></p><p><i>(Inverse marginal cost per unit of impact = Cost to donors / Net benefits of the interventions)</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Each of MCI\u2019s terms can be broken down further.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Cd, or more fully, the cost to donors per unit of intervention, can be estimated through the following equation:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Cd = Cprod \u2022 Psub \u2022 Md</i></p><p><i>(Cost to donors = Cost of product \u2022 Percent subsidy to beneficiaries \u2022 Markup factor)</i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>NBs, or, the net benefit of the subsidized intervention that can be attributable to the impact of donor financing, can be estimated through the following equation:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>NBs = NBann \u2022 Fattrib \u2022&nbsp; UF \u2022 NPVsum</i></p><p><i>(Net benefits = Annualized benefit minus alternative benefit without intervention \u2022 fraction of&nbsp;</i></p><p><i>intervention adoption attributable to donations \u2022 usage fraction \u2022 discounted present value)</i></p><p>In the project data will be collected from Solar4Africa and compared to the academic literature to try to set reasonable ranges for each of the parameters in the CE equation.</p><p>Finally, to calculate the distribution of possible CE results, I will use a \u201cpoor man\u2019s\u201d Monte Carlo calculation in which each of the above parameters will be broken down into low, medium, and high values based on the average of the 0-33%, 33-66%, and 66-100% respectively. These numbers will come from a rough assessment and evaluation of reasonable ranges for the various parameters that we get from an overview of the literature and what has been done in other CE calculations such as those published by GiveWell.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Conclusion</strong></h1><p>Given the apparently high CE of this project, I am excited to see how the CE can be maximized. Any input and suggestions that people may have on factors and approaches that I can take in my analysis would be greatly appreciated.&nbsp; I plan to take any suggestions and finish the CE analysis in the next month.&nbsp;</p><p><br>&nbsp;</p>", "user": {"username": "Joshua Choi"}}, {"_id": "Sza2p6GaWPPYBoPkk", "title": "AI Safety Camp 2024", "postedAt": "2023-11-18T10:37:02.734Z", "htmlBody": "", "user": {"username": "Linda Linsefors"}}, {"_id": "sGjZiLr2HhDSjrLaN", "title": "Help to Shape Australia's Plan to Prevent Pandemics", "postedAt": "2023-11-18T03:51:08.463Z", "htmlBody": "<p>44 years ago, <a href=\"https://ourworldindata.org/smallpox\">humanity eradicated smallpox</a>.&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>On December 9th, 1979, humanity declared victory.</p><p>This one evil, the horror from beyond memory, the monster that took 500 million people from this world, was destroyed.</p><p>You are a member of the species that did that.

Nevertheless, I think that the arguments hold as-is for relatively narrow subfields, e.g. what I imagine is mostly relevant for manufacturing lethal pathogens. One may want to exclude other information which might drive risks, such as information on AI safety (broadly defined) or energy production (nuclear energy or solar panels) among others, but this is out of the scope of this post.</p><p>I would like to thank Asher Brass, David Manheim, Edo Arad and Itay Knaan-Harpaz for useful comments on a draft of this post. They do not necessarily endorse the views expressed here, and all mistakes are mine.</p><h1>Feasibility</h1><h2>Technical feasibility</h2><p>Filtering information from textual datasets seems fairly straightforward. It seems easy to develop a classifier (e.g., fine-tuned from a small language model) detecting offensive cybersecurity-related information.</p><p>For example, one would want to exclude examples of specific vulnerabilities and exploits (e.g. all CVEs), information about classes of vulnerabilities (e.g. heap overflows and null dereference, in the context of vulnerabilities), exploitation mitigations (e.g. ASLR, DEP, SafeSEH, stack cookie, CFG, pointer tagging), exploitation techniques (e.g. ROP, NOP slides, heap spraying) and cybersecurity-related tools and toolchains (e.g. shellcodes, IDA, metasploit, antivirus capabilities, fuzzers). Some more debatable information to exclude are the code of particular attack surfaces (e.g. Linux TCP/IP stack) and technical details of real-world cybersecurity incidents. At any rate, all of these seem easy to detect.</p><p>Furthermore, as models' sample efficiency is very low at the present, it is likely that a moderately low false-negative level would suffice for significantly decreasing such capabilities.</p><h2>Social feasibility</h2><p>Most (legitimate) use cases don't employ such capabilities. Moreover, this kind of information is fairly narrow and self-contained, so excluding it from the dataset will likely not result in a meaningfully less capable model in other respects. Therefore, it seems likely that most actors \u2013 including AI labs and the open source community \u2013 won't have a strong incentive to include such information.</p><p>Moreover, actors might have relatively strong incentives to take such measures, whether because of worry from AI risks, avoidance of being sued in cases of (small case) misuse or accidents, or public reputation considerations.</p><p>It is true that some actors (such as pentesters, scientists, militaries, etc.) might be interested in such capabilities \u2013 both for legitimate and illegitimate uses. In such cases, they can train narrow models. I believe that this still reduces misuse and misalignment risks as I explain in the next section.</p><h1>Risk reduction</h1><h2>Misalignment risks</h2><p>Many misalignment risks are driven by such capabilities (see for example&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/BAzCGCys4BkzGDCWR/the-prototypical-catastrophic-ai-action-is-getting-root\"><u>[1]</u></a><a href=\"https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/tyE4orCtR8H9eTiEr/stuxnet-not-skynet-humanity-s-disempowerment-by-ai\"><u>[2]</u></a><a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/index/frontier-threats-red-teaming-for-ai-safety\"><u>[3]</u></a><a href=\"https://www.safe.ai/ai-risk\"><u>[4]</u></a><a href=\"https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/intrinsic-drives-and-extrinsic-misuse-two-intertwined-risks-of-ai/\"><u>[5]</u></a><a href=\"https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/gpt-2030-and-catastrophic-drives-four-vignettes/\"><u>[6]</u></a>). Clearly, reducing knowledge of such information thus reduces the likelihood of successful misalignment incidents.</p><p>To still employ such capabilities, models will either have to be sufficiently agentic and have strong in-context or online learning capabilities to acquire this information (through the internet for example), or be strong enough to invent them on their own (without even knowing what mitigations were implemented by humans). Both of these seem further in the future than when models would otherwise carry misalignment risks due to other factors. Thus, this could potentially buy significant time for AI safety work (including assisted by powerful, but not extremely powerful, AI models).</p><p>As mentioned above, some actors will still be interested in such capabilities. Nevertheless, in those cases they might be content with narrow(er) models, which therefore entail significantly smaller misalignment risks.</p><h2>Misuse risks</h2><p>Many misuse risks are driven by the very same capabilities (see for example&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.anthropic.com/index/frontier-threats-red-teaming-for-ai-safety\"><u>[3]</u></a><a href=\"https://www.safe.ai/ai-risk\"><u>[4]</u></a><a href=\"https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/intrinsic-drives-and-extrinsic-misuse-two-intertwined-risks-of-ai/\"><u>[5]</u></a><a href=\"https://bounded-regret.ghost.io/gpt-2030-and-catastrophic-drives-four-vignettes/\"><u>[6]</u></a><a href=\"https://cdn.governance.ai/Open-Sourcing_Highly_Capable_Foundation_Models_2023_GovAI.pdf\"><u>[7]</u></a>). Surely, these actions won't eliminate such risks, but they would significantly raise the bar for executing them. A malicious actor would have to either train an advanced model on their own, or gain access to such models' weights and further fine-tune them, both of which require significant know-how, money and time.</p><h1>Setting a norm</h1><p>With the recent surge in public interest in AI risks, this seems like a very good time for such actions. Given the risks and relative ease of implementation, it seems likely that some safety-minded actors could adopt these measures voluntarily in the near future. As these are simple enough and cost relatively little, even less safety-minded actors might be willing to take them soon after, as it becomes a more widely accepted practice, and as tools and standard methods make it easy to implement.</p><h1>Regulation test case</h1><p>The same considerations also seem to make this into a relatively easy target for training data regulation. Thus, this can serve as a test case for AI governance actors, policymakers, etc. to start with, leading to easier future regulation processes.</p><h1>Call to action</h1><p>Here are few calls to action:</p><ul><li><strong>AI labs</strong> can adopt these ideas, and implement them on their future models.</li><li><strong>AI safety researchers and engineers</strong> can develop a standardized tool for filtering such information, to be adopted by actors training models.</li><li><strong>AI governance actors</strong> can develop these ideas, and push for their regulation.</li><li><strong>Others</strong> can give feedback, point out shortcomings, and suggest other improvements.</li></ul><p>I am happy to assist with these (especially where my background in cybersecurity can help), and am available at shaybm9@gmail.com.</p>", "user": {"username": "shaybenmoshe"}}, {"_id": "JB6oPFMHjGyZCXtPP", "title": "I'm interviewing the author of 'Not Born Yesterday' \u2014 Hugo Mercier.

Something can be clearly unjustifiable, and yet not a big deal.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefj0930p22s8t\"><sup><a href=\"#fnj0930p22s8t\">[1]</a></sup></span></p><p>If I\u2019m right about this, then even a \u201ccheeseburger ethicist\u201d may still be \u201cwalking the walk\u201d, so long as their practical priorities correspond (sufficiently closely) to those prescribed by their moral theory.</p><p>But while disagreeing with Schwitzgebel about the significance of self-ascribed error, I take myself to be further confirming his <a href=\"https://schwitzsplinters.blogspot.com/2023/10/skeletal-vs-fleshed-out-philosophy.html\">subsequent claim</a> that \u201cwalking the walk\u201d helps to <i>flesh out</i> the substantive content of a moral view. After all, it\u2019s precisely by reflecting on <i>how I take myself to be living a broadly consequentialist-approved life</i> that we can see that <i>avoiding moral mistakes </i>per se isn\u2019t a high priority (for consequentialists <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/bleeding-heart-consequentialism\">of my stripe</a>). It really matters <strong>how much good it would do to remedy the mistake, and whether your efforts could be better spent elsewhere.</strong></p><h3>Don\u2019t sweat the small stuff</h3><p>As I wrote in response to <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/caplans-conscience-objection-to-utilitarianism\">Caplan\u2019s conscience objection</a>:</p><blockquote><p>[W]e aren\u2019t all-things-considered perfect. It\u2019s really tempting to make selfish [or short-sighted] decisions that are <i>less than perfectly justified</i>, and in fact we all do this <i>all the time</i>. Humans are inveterate rationalizers, and many seem to find it irresistible to contort their normative theories until they get the result that \u201cactually we\u2019ve most reason to do everything we actually do.\u201d But when stated explicitly like this, we can all agree that this is pure nonsense, right?</p><p>We should just be honest about the fact that our choices aren\u2019t always perfectly justified. That\u2019s not <i>ideal</i>, but nor is it the end of the world.</p></blockquote><p>Of course, some mistakes are more egregious than others. Perhaps many reserve the term \u2018wrong\u2019 for those moral mistakes that are so bad that you ought to feel significant guilt over them. I don\u2019t think eating meat is wrong in <i>that</i> sense. It\u2019s not like torturing puppies (just as failing to donate enough to charity <a href=\"https://www.philosophyetc.net/2012/04/singers-pond-and-quality-of-will.html\">isn\u2019t like watching a child drown</a> in this respect). Rather, it might require non-trivial effort for a generally decent person to pursue, and those efforts might be better spent elsewhere.</p><p>That doesn\u2019t mean that eating meat is actually <i>justified</i>. Rather, the suggestion is that some genuinely unjustified actions <i>aren\u2019t worth stressing over</i>. On my view, we should prioritize our moral efforts, and put more effort into making changes that have greater moral payoffs. For most people, their top moral priority should probably just be to <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/en-US/funds/effective-altruism-funds\">donate more</a> to effective charities.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefed94mquwwia\"><sup><a href=\"#fned94mquwwia\">[2]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Some may be in a position where they can do even more good via <a href=\"https://80000hours.org/career-guide/high-impact-jobs/\">high-impact work</a>. Personal consumption decisions have got to be way down the list of priorities, by contrast. And even within that sphere, we can subdivide it into the \u201clow hanging fruit\u201d of <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/review-of-animal-liberation-now#%C2%A7what-is-to-be-done\">comparatively higher-impact</a> personal choices (generally reduce consumption\u2014especially of chicken and turkey\u2014stick to \u201cpasture raised\u201d eggs, etc.), and note that the final step from a 90% to a 100% ethical diet may offer significantly lower moral returns per unit of effort.</p><p>So it\u2019s consistent to simultaneously hold that:</p><p>(1) Purchasing meat isn\u2019t justified: the moral interests of farmed animals straightforwardly outweigh our interest in eating them. So buying a cheeseburger constitutes a moral and practical mistake. And yet:</p><p>(2) It would be an even greater moral and practical mistake to invest your efforts into correcting this minor mistake <i>if</i> you could instead get far <i>greater</i> moral payoffs by directing your efforts elsewhere (e.g. donations).</p><p>Of course, if you\u2019re <i>already </i>vegan, or could easily and persistently become so with very little effort needed, then by all means go for it! Vegans are awesome, everyone should agree. But there are lots of ways to be awesome, and individuals will vary in which pursuits they personally <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/pick-some-low-hanging-fruit\">find easy</a> or difficult, so it\u2019s worth thinking about how to prioritize your efforts. The answer doesn\u2019t have to be the same for everyone.</p><h3>Still, factory farming is an abomination</h3><p>While I don\u2019t think the occasional cheeseburger is that big of a deal, I wouldn\u2019t want to give the impression that factory farming <i>as a whole</i> is no big deal. Quite the opposite: Bentham\u2019s Bulldog compellingly argues that <a href=\"https://benthams.substack.com/p/factory-farming-is-not-just-bad-its\">factory farming is literally the worst thing ever</a>: \u201croughly as bad as torturing a bit over 24 billion babies each year.\u201d</p><p>Changing one person\u2019s diet to slightly reduce this harm is a step in the right direction. <i>Even better</i> would be to <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/en-US/charities/animal-welfare-fund\">donate to effective animal charities</a> to effect change at scale via initiatives like corporate cage-free campaigns, R&amp;D into meat alternatives, and political advocacy for animal welfare legislation. (I\u2019ve donated over $10k to this cause area, plan to give more in future, and think this is <i>vastly more important</i> than personally avoiding meat consumption, even if meat consumption is wrong and failing to donate isn\u2019t. I think the comparison is a great example of why <a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/impermissibility-is-overrated\">(im)permissibility is overrated</a>.)</p><p>Perhaps the strongest case for prioritizing veganism more is to try to build up a social taboo against animal exploitation, like there is against cannibalism. It would indeed be <i>great</i> if everyone were vegan\u2014if I could push a button and make it so, I would. But if I could persuade just <i>ten</i> people either to become vegan <i>or</i> to donate to effective animal charities, I\u2019d prioritize the latter. (Those charities might even include vegan outreach initiatives that, with funding from ten individuals, could convince many <i>more</i> people of the merits of veganism.) And I take it that my actual situation is one in which I might reasonably hope to persuade a few people on the margins, but not anything close to everyone. (<a href=\"https://rychappell.substack.com/p/review-of-animal-liberation-now\">Not even Peter Singer</a> has managed that, alas!)</p><h3>Conclusion</h3><p>Animals matter. Eating them is (in typical cases) clearly wrong and unjustifiable. If you can avoid it without too much trouble: great! But avoiding wrongdoing should not be our top priority as moral agents. Rather, we\u2019ve more reason to direct our efforts in whatever ways would (expectably) do more good. Like by donating to effective animal charities. So: <a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/en-US/charities/animal-welfare-fund\">do that</a>!</p><p>You don\u2019t have to feel (very) bad about the occasional burger. But whatever you do, don\u2019t let cognitive dissonance from meat-eating delude you into believing that animals don\u2019t matter, or that you can\u2019t make a difference. They do, and you can. But, as in all areas of life, the main difference you make will not be via your personal consumption decisions. Those aren\u2019t the morally <i>weighty</i> decisions (however clear-cut they may be). If that\u2019s where your moral attention is currently focused, consider shifting your focus to the bigger picture, and how you could have a greater impact there.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnj0930p22s8t\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefj0930p22s8t\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>This is more obvious when thinking about prudential errors.

And restrictive battery cages\u2014small wire cages used to confine laying hens\u2014 are one of the worst sources of suffering for chickens. Ending the battery cage means ending the acute suffering of millions of birds. THL is committed to ending the abuse of animals raised for food by:</p><ul><li><strong>Holding companies accountable to their cage-free commitments.&nbsp;</strong>Thousands of companies around the world have pledged to transition to 100% cage-free, eliminating the practice of confining hens in tiny, barren battery cages. Now, THL is holding these companies accountable, ensuring they keep their promises. Globally,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://assets.ctfassets.net/ww1ie0z745y7/5FJvFwKIYDwJHAzQxac8g2/8dcdb876ed3e569076fc4b3123d5d2bc/OWA-2023-ENG-cage-free-egg-fulfillment-report-final.pdf\"><u>89% of companies followed through on their 2022 cage-free pledge</u></a>. And in the US and globally, THL pushed the companies falling behind on their commitments to follow through on their promise. In 2023, THL held 36 companies with global cage-free commitments accountable to reporting progress on their pledges. Companies like&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thehumaneleague.org/article/open-wing-alliance-applauds-kelloggs-for-reporting-its-global-progress\"><u>Kellogg\u2019s,</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thehumaneleague.org/article/the-open-wing-alliance-succeeds-in-petitioning-pepsico-to-report-global-cage\"><u>PepsiCo</u></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thehumaneleague.org/article/yum-brands-makes-rapid-progress-on-its-100-cage-free-egg-commitment-just-two\"><u>Yum! Brands</u></a> \u2014&nbsp;the world\u2019s largest service restaurant company and the parent company of KFC, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell \u2014 began publicly reporting on their cage-free commitments. All of this is translating to real change on the ground, with 39.4% of the US egg-laying flock free from cages (over ~120 million hens), up from ~5% when THL began this work in 2014.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefj8w2iid2brb\"><sup><a href=\"#fnj8w2iid2brb\">[3]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;(Global data is currently unavailable)</li><li><strong>Progressing the cage-free movement globally.</strong> In addition to holding companies accountable for their existing commitments, THL is working to secure new cage-free commitments in key strategic areas around the world. Through the OWA, our coalition of nearly 100 member groups in 67 countries, THL is developing a global movement of effective animal advocates that conduct coordinated international and regional campaigns for layer hen and/or broiler chicken welfare. This year, the OWA pushed 103 global companies to pledge to rid their supply chains of cruel battery cages, including first cage-free commitments from corporations headquartered in Japan, the Middle East, Greece, Ukraine, Peru, Ecuador, South Africa, Argentina, South Korea, and Taiwan. And following a months-long international campaign facilitated by the OWA,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thehumaneleague.org/article/jollibee-victory\"><u>Jollibee Foods Corporation</u></a>, the largest and fastest-growing restaurant group in Asia, pledged to reform its global supply chain, impacting an estimated 2 million birds annually. This victory is especially key as we look to progress cage-free work in Asia, where nearly 68% of the world\u2019s eggs are produced.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3><strong>Our Room for More Funding</strong></h3><p>In THL\u2019s 2023 review, ACE estimated that THL had a 2024-2025 funding gap of $10.5M. Additional marginal funding will be used to support our 2024 - 2026 strategic plan, including continuing our work to secure new cage-free commitments in key areas of the world, as well as holding US and global companies accountable for their cage-free commitments. In particular, more funding is needed for travel to effectively conduct our global work, as well as digital advertising to pressure companies and recruit new supporters to power our campaign. In 2023, both these areas were significantly resource-constrained, and created bottlenecks that prevented us from achieving additional impact.</p><p>If THL were to receive more significant additional funding, we have developed a robust&nbsp;<strong>expansion plan for the OWA through 2030</strong>. The goal of this expansion is to free one billion hens from cages by 2030 and achieve a critical tipping point in the OWA\u2019s mission to eliminate battery cages from the planet.&nbsp;Campaigns against global companies have worked well, but to phase out battery cages across the globe, we must have a robust and high-functioning alliance in every major country.&nbsp;</p><p>Our success in building an effective global alliance is outpacing the operational support THL is able to provide, given our own resource constraints. Our current model of having a single regional OWA coordinator to support upwards of 20 member groups with differing needs across an entire continent is no longer sustainable. As the OWA is one of the only international movement building resources available, our constraints mean that groups are unable to get the training and support that they need, alongside the strategic guidance and leadership development. We also see a huge appetite from groups to expand what the OWA is offering so that we can be an even more effective global coalition.&nbsp;</p><p>To achieve the current need and anticipated growth, we need to create small teams in key regions around the world that can then support the differing needs of groups in their respective regions. Those regions are Asia-Pacific\u2014where we especially need more groups securing cage-free commitments in Asia\u2014the Americas\u2014where we need more cage-free commitments and corporate accountability, particularly in Latin America\u2014and EMEA (Europe, Middle East, Africa)\u2014where we need several more groups in the Middle East, and more support for existing groups in Africa and Europe. These teams would include hiring more campaigners and corporate negotiators to develop customized strategies in coordination with regional OWA leaders, more animal welfare scientists to provide local groups with scientific evidence and support tailored to each region, and regional teams to recruit and support new groups on effective campaigning. To scale this up, we estimate this will cost an additional $2.5M in 2024 and an additional $8M in 2025 and beyond.</p><p>We would also increase our OWA grants by more than $1M and staff up core supporting teams (Operations, Communications, and Development) as needed to meet the needs of the expanded OWA and Global teams.&nbsp;</p><p>Another program that is primed for expansion is the&nbsp;<strong>Animal Policy Alliance</strong>\u2014already 14 member groups strong, and we have a goal to reach at least 30 active alliance members by 2025.&nbsp;THL launched the APA in 2022 to organize, unite, and empower local and state-level animal advocacy groups that are involved in issue-based advocacy and implementing legislative strategies for animals with policy agendas that include animals raised for food. These groups harness and channel the grassroots power of a significant base of animal protection advocates in the United States that they then use to create relationships with legislators at the city, state and federal level, and advocate for policies that benefit animals. Over time, through its leadership role in this alliance and through its grant-making capacity, THL will also influence local groups to focus more on farmed animal and food system issues.&nbsp;</p><p>The APA can immediately support $500K-$1M in APA grants. We distributed $500K in grants in 2022 and were unable to continue the grants program in 2023 due to funding constraints. But through this process, we know the need for funding policy work in the US is strong, and that there are dozens of groups eager to expand their advocacy for farmed animals.</p><p>Alongside the expansion of the alliance and APA grants, we would need to expand the APA team and core teams, which we estimate would cost $1M in 2024 and $1.5M in 2025 in total.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>Opportunities to Support THL</strong></h3><p>Donate to THL directly on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thehumaneleague.org/\"><u>our website</u></a> or vote for us in the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/fundraisers/ea-forum-donation-election-2023-the-humane-league\"><u>EA Forum donation election</u></a>!

Rote expansions of existing technologies and machines inevitably hit a ceiling: replacing and repairing the existing infrastructure and capital becomes so expensive that there is no income left over for building extra copies. The only way out of this is to come up with new technologies which create more income for the same investment, thus restarting the feedback loop between income growth and investment.</p><p>So R&amp;D is extremely valuable. But most of the gains from R&amp;D accrue to external parties. <a href=\"https://www.nber.org/digest/oct04/who-gains-innovation\"><u>William Nordhaus estimates</u></a> that firms recover maybe 2% of the value they create by developing new technologies. The rest of the value goes to other firms who copy their ideas and customers who get new products at lower prices. Firms don\u2019t care much about the benefits that accrue to others so they invest much less in R&amp;D than the rest of us would like them to.</p><p>Governments, on the other hand, collect much more of the benefits from new technologies. They get to tax the entire economy so when benefits spillover across firms and consumers, they still come out ahead. They don\u2019t collect on international spillovers but for large economies at the frontier of technological growth, like the US, they internalize a large chunk of the value from R&amp;D, much more than 2%.</p><p>All of this is a setup for a classic externalities problem. There\u2019s some big benefit to society that private decision makers don\u2019t internalize, so we should rely on governments to subsidize R&amp;D closer to its socially optimal level.</p><p>But in fact, <a href=\"https://ncses.nsf.gov/pubs/nsb20221/u-s-and-global-research-and-development\"><u>the private sector spends ~4x more than the public sector on R&amp;D</u></a>: $463 vs $138 billion dollars a year. One explanation for this might be that the extra $138 billion is all that was needed to bump up private spending to the social optimum, but this doesn\u2019t seem to hold up in the data. One piece of evidence that we are still far off the socially optimal spending on R&amp;D comes form <a href=\"https://www.newthingsunderthesun.com/pub/ijugr2h6/release/11\"><u>a simple accounting of the average</u></a> returns to R&amp;D by Larry Summers and Benjamin Jones.</p><p>They model the returns to R&amp;D spending like this: imagine stopping all R&amp;D spending for a single year. You\u2019d save several hundred billion dollars upfront, but there would be no economic growth,<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefyq8lbgzqvch\"><sup><a href=\"#fnyq8lbgzqvch\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;so we\u2019d miss out on a ~2% increase in per capita GDP. The upfront savings only happen once, but next year when we start R&amp;D up again we have 2% less to invest so we grow less, and next year we\u2019re still behind, and so on ad infinitum.</p><p>These repeated long term costs of missing R&amp;D add up to outweigh the upfront benefits from the money we\u2019d save under most reasonable views of the value of economic growth and the contribution of R&amp;D to that growth. Summers and Jones suggest that each dollar spent on R&amp;D creates $14 dollars of value on average!</p><p>So this leaves us with a question: Why aren\u2019t governments taking this free lunch? Why are they letting the weakly incentivized private firms outspend them on the world\u2019s most important positive externality?</p><p>This puzzle is explained by the <a href=\"https://maximumprogress.substack.com/p/spatial-vs-temporal-externalities\"><u>distinction between spatial and temporal externalities</u></a>. The argument we made above about how the government collects on spillovers between firms and customers because it taxes the entire economy is true, but only if those spillovers happen fast. No decision maker in government today benefits from R&amp;D spillovers that accrue 20 years later. In fact, they are often made worse off since R&amp;D spending has immediate costs and only future benefits. Perhaps governments as a single abstract entity internalize the country wide benefits of R&amp;D that accrue decades in the future, but no actual decision maker working in government stands to gain.</p><p>Market actors, on the other hand, are better incentivized to care about temporal externalities. The owner of a firm investing in R&amp;D doesn\u2019t account for all the benefits their technology might bring to non-paying consumers and firms, but they do care about the benefits that R&amp;D will bring to the firm long into the future, even after their death. One part of this is that owners don\u2019t face term limits that incentivize pump-and-dump attempts to garner voter support. But even if the owner of a company knows they are retiring soon, they still have good reason to care for the long term value of their firm. This is because when they go to retire and sell the company, they are paid the present discounted value, which takes into account the company\u2019s future prospects. In many industries R&amp;D is a major determinant of these future prospects.</p><p>There is more going on in government\u2019s decision of how much R&amp;D to fund than their greater care for spatial externalities over temporal ones. This story doesn\u2019t explain why they spend $50 billion on long-term basic research without short term benefit, for example, but it does explain why private firms are doing more to provide for this positive externality than governments are.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fnyq8lbgzqvch\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnrefyq8lbgzqvch\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p><u>The qualitative conclusion that R&amp;D spending has large average returns holds under significant relaxations of this assumption.</u></p></div></li></ol>", "user": {"username": "Maxwell Tabarrok"}}, {"_id": "Bu2gbG3GoDpfSFwdx", "title": "AI Safety Research Organization Incubation Program - Expression of Interest", "postedAt": "2023-11-20T22:25:39.934Z", "htmlBody": "<p><strong>Tl;dr: If you might want to participate in our incubation program and found an AI safety research organization,&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://airtable.com/appZBa51aagC7D1OU/shrBnOJkKORWY1A2B?prefill_fromEOI=yes&amp;hide_fromEOI=true\"><u>express your interest here</u></a>.<strong> If you want to help out in other ways please fill out that same form.</strong></p><figure class=\"image image_resized\" style=\"width:22.32%\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Bu2gbG3GoDpfSFwdx/wwxcmpshxvkqsq0ssvj0\"></figure><p>We -&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.catalyze-impact.org/\"><u>Catalyze Impact</u></a> - believe it is a bottleneck in AI safety that there are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alignmentforum.org/posts/MhudbfBNQcMxBBvj8/there-should-be-more-ai-safety-orgs\"><u>too few AI safety organizations</u></a>.

We\u2019re currently reaching out to people in the EA network. So far we have between 20%-50% of our budget promised and fundraising is currently one of the main things we\u2019re focusing on.</p><p>The major components of our first year budget are&nbsp;<strong>co-founder time, country visits, and delivery of a pilot program</strong>,<strong> which aims to do household-level TB screening and provision of preventative medication.</strong></p><p>We think that this project has a lot of promise:</p><ul><li>Tuberculosis has a huge global burden, killing 1.3 million people every year, and is disproportionately neglected and fatal in young children.</li><li>The evidence for preventative treatment is robust and household programs are promising, yet few high-burden countries have scaled up this intervention.</li><li>Modeling by Charity Entrepreneurship and by academics indicate that this can be competitive with the best GiveWell-recommended charities.</li></ul><p>If we don\u2019t manage to raise at least half of our target budget by the beginning of December 2023 then we\u2019ll switch from our intended focus for the next month from program planning to additional fundraising. This will push out our timelines for getting to the useful work.</p><p>If we don\u2019t manage to raise our full target budget by the end of 2023 then we\u2019ll scale back our ambitions in the immediate term, until we put additional time into fundraising a few months later. The lower budget will also limit the size of our proof-of-concept effort since we and our government partners will need to scale back work to the available funds.</p><p>You can donate directly via our <a href=\"https://give.cornerstone.cc/spiro\">Cornerstone page</a> - best for most countries.</p><p>You can alternately donate via&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/en-GB/charities/charity-entrepreneurship-incubated-charities\"><u>Giving What We Can\u2019s fund</u></a> for charities incubated through Charity Entrepreneurship - best for the UK and the Netherlands.

If you\u2019re planning to come to Berlin and would like to meet some like-minded people, send. EA Berlin Organizers are always happy to connect you with people you\u2019d be interested in talking to!&nbsp;</p><p>Berlin has a relatively broad community of professionals working in EA organizations, organizations considered high-impact by EA, or other impactful jobs. While some of these organizations are centered in Berlin, many people work in remote positions. The spectrum of cause areas people are working on reflects to a big part the cause areas from the global EA community: Animal Advocacy, Global Health, AI governance and technical AI safety, Bio Security, Civilizational Resilience, Political Advocacy, Climate, Mental Health, Journalism, Effective Giving, EA Meta and Operations, and more.&nbsp;</p><p>There\u2019s also an active Rationality/LessWrong/Wait But Why/Slate Star Codex community in Berlin, with many of their events posted&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/lesswrong-rationality-waitbutwhy-slatestarcodex-berlin/\"><u>in this meetup group</u></a>. If you\u2019d like to dive into the veganism scene in Berlin, check out&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.berlin-vegan.de/termine/\"><u>the berlin-vegan website</u></a>.&nbsp;</p><h1>\"The Vibes\"</h1><p>People outside of Berlin often are interested in what \u201cthe vibes\u201d of the EA Berlin community are. This is certainly hard to explain, as subjective experiences matter a lot here and can be quite different.&nbsp;</p><p>As Berlin is a diverse city with lots of different subcultures, this also reflects to some people in the EA community. These people are often interested in ideas from the alternative scene, like different forms of meditation, yoga, techno culture, non-traditional relationship forms, festivals and more. Some EA people in Berlin are living in shared apartments together, both purely with EAs and with other interesting people, e.g. from the startup scene. We\u2019re not aware of any co-living situations in Berlin where professional and private relationships are intermixed, which reduces potential conflict of interests.&nbsp;</p><p>It is important to highlight that only a subset of people in the community subscribe to these interests and that having similar interests certainly isn\u2019t a precondition to get in touch with EAs in Berlin. Also, all official EA Berlin events focus on EA-related topics in order to welcome everyone regardless of their personal interests.&nbsp;</p><p>The professional EA community in Berlin is centered around the <i>TEAMWORK</i> coworking space, which has strong \u201cget sh*t done\u201d vibes: an environment focussed on efficiently doing impactful work. The coworking space also fosters a lot of professional exchange, with a tradition of having daily lunch together. Additionally, <i>TEAMWORK</i> serves as a Schelling point for EAs coming to Berlin from all over the world as well as a meetup location for local EA events.&nbsp;</p><h1>Coworking spaces and offices</h1><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CaYqXsrHbuvtkGMGy/vep8vdb2wowo6qyfnt0k\" srcset=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CaYqXsrHbuvtkGMGy/houyyxycdjg5wlegyhzx 410w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CaYqXsrHbuvtkGMGy/srsfci2sleoejcopmjxc 820w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CaYqXsrHbuvtkGMGy/eioygmrzrncat2c6ufkr 1230w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CaYqXsrHbuvtkGMGy/knznvvhjflnzfbsfqdey 1640w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CaYqXsrHbuvtkGMGy/ximqoobvjvnnomzxblzs 2050w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CaYqXsrHbuvtkGMGy/ycd0tkzdpxqi8vtczdu0 2460w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CaYqXsrHbuvtkGMGy/vwybweyrkrcdqaznfusw 2870w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CaYqXsrHbuvtkGMGy/paizqpqwycpbr3ge1ekv 3280w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CaYqXsrHbuvtkGMGy/doqw7dnluw5gdqtnekzt 3690w, https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CaYqXsrHbuvtkGMGy/atzupxkmenwwkljpiasp 4032w\"></figure><p>The EA community in Berlin is happy to have a coworking space for EA professionals called&nbsp;<i>TEAMWORK</i> in the northwest of the city (in the neighborhood of Wedding), run by&nbsp;<a href=\"https://effektiv-spenden.org/\"><u>Effektiv Spenden</u></a>. If you would like to visit the coworking space to work from there or meet people, <a href=\"https://www.teamwork-berlin.org/\">apply there</a> beforehand.&nbsp;</p><p>Some animal advocacy organizations popular among individuals in EA also have their own offices in Berlin: The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://albertschweitzerfoundation.org/\"><u>Albert Schweitzer Foundation</u></a> is located near Alexanderplatz,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://animalequality.de/\"><u>Animal Equality</u></a> works in a coworking space in Prenzlauer Berg, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://proveg.com/de/\"><u>ProVeg Germany</u></a> and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://proveg.com/\"><u>ProVeg International</u></a> have their office spaces in Tiergarten. There is also the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://provegincubator.com/\"><u>ProVeg Incubator</u></a>, where public events occasionally take place.</p><h1>What to do (that's not work)</h1><p>While Berlin has much to offer, this section covers a few highlights we can recommend (and we think people in EA could like).&nbsp;</p><h2>Museums</h2><ul><li>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://futurium.de/\"><strong><u>Futurium</u></strong></a>, directly next to the main train station, offers perspectives on the future, especially regarding the role of technology. Topics include, for example, climate protection and food. Note that the exhibitions there typically cover topics more from a popular view and less from a futurist's perspective (and no, AI doesn\u2019t play a major role at Futurium). There are also public tours and other events.&nbsp;</li><li>The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://anti-kriegs-museum.de/en/start-english/\"><strong><u>Anti-War Museum</u></strong></a> is a small but nice museum in Wedding, where you can learn about the effects of nuclear weapons and see, among other things, an originally preserved air-raid shelter from World War II. The museum is open daily from 4 to 8 pm, and admission is free.&nbsp;</li><li>For those interested in great power conflicts: The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.deutsches-spionagemuseum.de/en/museum\"><strong><u>German Spy Museum</u></strong></a> provides insights into the spying technology of the Cold War, and is also worth a visit.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Tours and places of interest</h2><ul><li>At&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.spsg.de/en/palaces-gardens/object/cecilienhof-country-house-new-garden/\"><strong><u>Cecilienhof Palace in Potsdam</u></strong></a>, the \"Potsdam Conference\" took place in the summer of 1945, which was the summit meeting of the Allied powers of the Second World War. During the conference, US President Harry S. Truman gave the order to drop the first deployed atomic bomb, which then destroyed the Japanese city of Hiroshima on August 6.&nbsp;</li><li>On a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://vegantoursberlin.com/en/vegan-food-tour-berlin\"><strong><u>vegan food tour</u></strong></a>, you can discover the best of the best vegan food in Berlin while listening to some story telling about the city. Available for different districts.&nbsp;</li><li>On selected dates, <strong>a&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"http://www.berliner-spurensuche.de/\"><strong><u>tour of the historical slaughterhouse grounds</u></strong></a> near the Frankfurter Tor in Friedrichshain is offered. Many original buildings are still intact and reveal a lot about the mechanization of killing, processing of animal carcasses, and miserable working conditions. The tour lasts about two hours and costs 11 euros. The tour is in German by default, ask if they offer an English version beforehand.&nbsp;</li><li>In terms of things to do that are less explicitly EA, <a href=\"https://www.darkmatter.berlin/\"><strong>Dark Matter</strong></a> is a light show/exhibit in the east of the city. Great for Instagram, and is an immersive art experience that feels very \u201cBerlin.\u201d&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>Discover&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.berliner-unterwelten.de/\"><strong><u>the underground bunkers of Berlin</u></strong></a> with this very popular local tour. Make sure to book a tour about a week in advance! Of particular interest to EAs is a tour of a nuclear shelter near the U-Bahn station Pankstra\u00dfe. The steel-concrete doors, crowd control barriers, and bunk beds clearly reveal the fate that survivors of a nuclear war would have suffered.</li></ul><h2>Food</h2><p>Berlin is a paradise for vegans. There is a wide range of vegan restaurants, vegan caf\u00e9s, vegan shops, vegan supermarkets, vegan bars and more. For a general overview, take a look at the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.berlin-vegan.de/map?lang=en\"><u>Berlin-Vegan map</u></a> or download the<a href=\"https://www.berlin-vegan.de/bv-guide/\">&nbsp;<u>Berlin-Vegan app</u></a> (full English version of both available).

If you\u2019re interested in D\u00f6ner Kebab, this is typically on the top lists. Pro-tip: skip the one at Mehringdamm if there\u2019s a long line \u2013 the other ones at locations like Warschauer Str are just as good. If you\u2019re far from a Mustafa\u2019s, any shop that does Gem\u00fcse D\u00f6ner and/or has a bit of a line is a safe bet.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Party / Clubs</h2><p>Berlin is famous for its nightlife, great clubs and tough bouncers. Even if you\u2019re not into electronic music or clubbing, it\u2019s worth checking out Berlin\u2019s unique scene. If you\u2019re visiting during summer, you can even go in the daytime.

However, people EAs in Berlin sometimes rent out (a room in) their flats for other people to stay. This can be both for short-term stays (a few days or weeks), or even permanently.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnrefn4vi651m6ng\"><sup><a href=\"#fnn4vi651m6ng\">[6]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;Some options are listed in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://coda.io/d/EA-Houses_dePaxf_RJiq/EA-Houses-couchsurfing-renting-to-give_suGq6#_lurkc\"><u>this document</u></a>, but feel encouraged to also ask in the housing channel in the EA Berlin telegram group and/or the #berlin_housing channel in the EA Germany slack.<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref5ze46zc6hvh\"><sup><a href=\"#fn5ze46zc6hvh\">[7]</a></sup></span></p><p>Take a look at &nbsp;<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f22aX72WxbO17qD3seH06hVbCGptY-yF-zYrJ5pwGSw/edit?usp=sharing\"><u>at these notes</u></a> about general tips to find a flat in Berlin.&nbsp;</p><h2>Hotels / Flats</h2><p>Use a website like booking.com or airbnb.com to find a suitable hotel or flat. At most hotels, breakfast will be buffet style. Don\u2019t hesitate to ask if they can arrange vegan options for you if you prefer vegan food. In any case, there are numerous and diverse vegan caf\u00e9s in Berlin, so you won\u2019t start your day hungry.&nbsp;</p><h2>Transportation</h2><p>Public transport is fairly good in Berlin and recommended. Since Berlin is a big city (at least to German standards) plan getting around accordingly. It can often take you 40 minutes to get from one place in the city to the other. Berlin is quite nice to explore by bike, and bicycles are also a lot cheaper to rent than the other options.&nbsp;</p><p>Check out <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rIhgA26yLn6zgBlyZmGk4dkydf5sLVwC8UIzm-xvM2A/edit\">this document</a> for more information on how to get to Berlin, which public transport tickets to buy and which apps can be recommended.&nbsp;</p><p>In short</p><ul><li>For public transport in the city, mostly a Berlin AB ticket is the one you should get. Available at all subway stations or on the <a href=\"https://www.jelbi.de/en/jelbi-app-2/\"><i><u>Jelbi</u></i></a> app.&nbsp;</li><li>For renting scooters or car rides use any app of your choice. <a href=\"https://www.jelbi.de/en/jelbi-app-2/\"><i><u>Jelbi</u></i></a> &nbsp;or <a href=\"https://www.free-now.com/de-en/ride/download-app/\"><i><u>Free Now</u></i></a> can be recommended.&nbsp;</li><li>To rent bicycles at a cheap price, use <a href=\"https://www.nextbike.de/en/\"><i><u>Nextbike</u></i></a><i><u>.&nbsp;</u></i></li></ul><h1>Climate and Geography</h1><p>Check the current weather conditions before coming to Berlin. It can become hot in summer and cold in winter, with rainfalls possible throughout the whole year.</p><p>Geographically, Berlin is very flat. Unlike many cities, Berlin does not have a single \u201ccenter\u201d where everything is concentrated. Instead, every neighborhood (or, as the locals say, Kiez) has its own hot spots. Different Kieze have a different vibe and target group, Friedrichshain, Prenzlauer Berg, Kreuzberg, Neuk\u00f6lln stand out.&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Friedrichshain: Known for its vibrant street art, Friedrichshain is a hub of youthful energy, attracting a creative and bohemian crowd. It's famous for its nightlife, with numerous clubs and bars, and also has a strong counterculture history. The area is popular among young professionals and students.</li><li>Prenzlauer Berg: This area is characterized by beautifully restored old buildings and a more upscale, family-friendly atmosphere. It's known for its caf\u00e9 culture, organic markets, and boutique shops. Prenzlauer Berg attracts a mix of young families, artists, and professionals, and is known for its cosmopolitan and trendy vibe.</li><li>Kreuzberg: Historically a center for Berlin's alternative and punk scenes, Kreuzberg is diverse and multicultural. It's famous for its street art, diverse food scene, and lively festivals like the annual May Day celebration. The area is a magnet for artists, students, and immigrants, giving it a unique and eclectic atmosphere.</li><li>Neuk\u00f6lln: Once a working-class district, Neuk\u00f6lln has transformed into a trendy area known for its multicultural population. It's characterized by a mix of hip bars, vintage shops, and diverse eateries. The area is popular among young creatives and students, and is known for its lively and unpolished charm.</li></ul><h1>EA Berlin Organizers</h1><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/CaYqXsrHbuvtkGMGy/qonz1lkf16qjcxrzqrav\"><figcaption>Martin Wicke, Martin \u201cMilli\u201d Milbradt</figcaption></figure><h2>Martin Wicke</h2><p>Hi, I\u2019m Martin!

Our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://allfed.info/images/pdfs/Preprint%20V2.0%20Integrated%20assessment%20ALLFED.docx.pdf\"><u>integrated assessment model</u></a> of combined resilient food deployment is being revamped and will be updated soon; it has recently been applied to a new article looking at country-level nuclear winter response in Argentina. Further ongoing research this year has focused on infrastructure collapse scenarios, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://allfed.info/images/pdfs/Agricultural%20yields%20without%20industry.pdf\"><u>crop yield loss modeling</u></a>, supply chain interventions (transportation of food and water) and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://allfed.info/images/pdfs/Digital%20fragility.pdf\"><u>system dynamics</u></a>.

Increasing geopolitical tensions have compelled us to expedite the translation of our scientific research into actionable policy. Examples include our reports outlining the content of national preparedness and response plans against abrupt sunlight reduction scenarios (e.g. nuclear winter) for various countries such as the United States, Australia, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://riesgoscatastroficosglobales.com/s/Report-Food-Security-in-Argentina-in-theevent-of-an-Abrupt-Sunlight-Reduction-Scenario-ASRS.pdf\"><u>Argentina</u></a>.</p><p>We will continue to work on all three pillars of ALLFED\u2019s work: research, policy, and technology development.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Projects: where is marginal funding likely to be spent?</strong></h1><p><strong>Research:&nbsp;</strong>previous funding will enable ALLFED to continue work in a large project to create an integrated assessment model of food system responses to counter yield losses of full-scale nuclear winter-level (<a href=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s43016-022-00573-0\"><u>150\u2009Tg soot, global average calorie production from crops would decrease by ~80-90%</u></a>). We are in the process of publishing the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://assets.researchsquare.com/files/rs-1446444/v1_covered.pdf?c=1648840855\"><u>first</u></a>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://allfed.info/images/pdfs/Preprint%20V2.0%20Integrated%20assessment%20ALLFED.docx.pdf\"><u>sets</u></a> of results. Previous funding will also allow us to continue key priority research projects on the topic of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2212420922000176\"><u>resilient foods for nuclear winter-level shocks</u></a>. In this funding appeal we would instead like to ask for support to:</p><ol><li>Overhaul our more neglected line of research. Specifically, research into interventions to increase resilience and response capabilities to scenarios involving extreme, abrupt collapse of critical infrastructure (e.g.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://eujournalfuturesresearch.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40309-021-00178-z\"><u>loss of electricity/industry</u></a>), which could be caused by an extreme pandemic resulting in employees in critical industries being too fearful to report to work. This would also involve designing a resilient backup communication system (such as a resilient satellite that could communicate directly with cell phones). Previously we proposed using draft animals for farming and transportation, but we are now investigating wood gasification that was used in WWII to substitute for petroleum products. This would also involve defining how an effective resilient food response to this scenario would look, and developing the required methods and tool designs to achieve it. We estimate the need as ~3 FTE with support ($300,000).</li><li>Maintaining our researchers to carry out other priority projects. For example, research on combination scenarios is crucial to understand not only how to prevent humanity from surviving a most extreme scenario involving a global food production collapse combined with a loss of global industry and supply chains (e.g. via a full-scale nuclear war involving coordinated nuclear EMP attacks), but also how to best help regions likely to be a target of nuclear attacks in a war, such as the USA and the European Union (where nuclear EMP is very likely even if it does not take place globally). We\u2019ve estimated a requirement of ~5 additional FTE including research, operations, etc. to kickstart this ($500,000).&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</li></ol><p><strong>Translation of research into policy</strong>:&nbsp;</p><p>Additional funding will be used to:</p><ul><li>Support existing policy engagements in the USA, Australia and Argentina.</li><li>Kickstart a new regional preparedness planning project in a key region (e.g. Scandinavia, New Zealand, Persian Gulf).

In the talk, I introduce the concept of behavioural science, discuss how it relates to effective altruism, and highlight some common mistakes we make when trying to change behaviour for societal good.</p><p>Want to skim a post instead of consuming a 30-minute video? I don\u2019t blame you, here\u2019s the basics of my talk\u2026</p><h1>Imagine a world\u2026</h1><p>Imagine a world where\u2026</p><ul><li><strong>We know what the most effective charities are.</strong> We've got a list of all the charities that exist, we've got detailed information about each one, and we've ranked them on various criteria that we care about. There's no more uncertainty, GiveWell is out of business, and we know where to funnel our charitable donations.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>We have perfected our biosecurity risk standards</strong>. We understand all the potential risks. We know how we can prevent things like lab leaks from occurring. We\u2019ve even developed safety protocols outlining everything we need to do.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>We just understand sentience.&nbsp;</strong>Turns out the hard problem of consciousness wasn't actually that hard to solve. We understand which beings are sentient \u2013 which beings feel pleasure and pain \u2013 and we know why.</li></ul><p>Sounds pretty great, right? In this world, we seem to have achieved monumental strides.</p><p>Yet, perhaps this wouldn\u2019t be that exciting: these strides say nothing about the impact we\u2019re having.</p><p>Why?</p><ul><li>We may understand what the most effective charities are, but <strong>what happens if no one donates to them?</strong><br>&nbsp;</li><li>We may develop biosecurity risk standards and protocols, but <strong>what does that mean if people don't comply with them?</strong><br>&nbsp;</li><li>We may know which beings are sentient, but <strong>what impact does that have if we don't change our treatment of those beings?</strong></li></ul><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Kjm8nbkSzMt2rLmX4/jqdw4igpxpqqvywbks1y\"><figcaption><i>Figure 1. </i>A hypothetical world where we have knowledge and understanding, but not necessarily impact.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>These examples demonstrate that we can have knowledge, understanding, and even action, but if we don't understand how to change behaviour \u2013 we might not have the impact that we want.</p><h1>What is behavioural science?</h1><p>Behavioural science is the scientific study of human behaviour. Why do people do the things they do? Why do they make the decisions that they do? What needs to change in order for them to do differently?</p><p>Behavioural science considers many influences: conscious thoughts, habits, motivations, the social context, and more. It borrows from several disciplines, including economics, psychology, and sociology.</p><h1>What is the role of behavioural science in effective altruism?</h1><p>Here is a (very) basic theory of change for effective altruism.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Kjm8nbkSzMt2rLmX4/g56zqb8tp1qjfpiuqbcv\"><figcaption><i>Figure 2. </i>A (very) basic theory of change for effective altruism.</figcaption></figure><p>We know how to do the most good. We act on that knowledge. And, as a result, we hopefully have an impact.</p><p>Examples of things we can do at the knowledge stage include understanding which charities are most effective, creating problem profiles, and predicting what existential risks are most consequential or likely. At the action stage, we could donate to those charities, make career changes based on what we think is most impactful, or actually work to prevent existential risks.&nbsp;</p><p>How does behavioural science come into this? It focuses on the action stage and it asks, \u2018How?\u2019. How do we get people to donate to effective charities? How do we encourage others to make career changes, or work to prevent existential risks? Behavioural science can inform how we act, or how we get others to act, in order to enhance our impact.</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Kjm8nbkSzMt2rLmX4/kk1mib41nfea3s7tw03y\"><figcaption><i>Figure 3. </i>The role of behavioural science in the basic theory of change.</figcaption></figure><p>Note that there are different audiences we can target when we\u2019re thinking about behaviour change. Some audience \u2018levels\u2019 include:</p><ul><li>Individuals / the population level: This often involves behaviours that many people can engage in. For instance, donating to charity or reducing animal-product consumption.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>Critical actors: This includes people who possess specific skills or are in an influential position. For example, they might play an important role in institutional decision making, or perhaps they\u2019re in a unique position to shape AI governance.<br>&nbsp;</li><li>The community: Effective altruism is not just a philosophical concept; it's also a social movement. In this context, the community plays a significant role. We want to attract people to meetups, sustain motivation, maintain a great culture, etc.</li></ul><p>Sounds simple, right?</p><h1>Common mistakes we make when trying to change behaviour for societal good</h1><p>Well, there are several common mistakes we make when trying to change behaviour. I\u2019ll outline three of them here:</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mistake #1: \u201cI know what the problem is\u201d</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mistake #2: \u201cI know what works\u201d</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Mistake #3: \u201cI\u2019ll just use one strategy\u201d</p><h2>Mistake #1: \u2018I know what the problem is\u2019</h2><h3>Summary of this mistake</h3><p>Often, we jump to conclusions about what the problem is \u2013 what it is that\u2019s causing the \u2018bad\u2019 behaviour or preventing the \u2018good\u2019 behaviour from occurring. For example, you might assume that people don\u2019t donate to effective charities because they\u2019re not aware that some charities are more effective than others. That is, you assume that the problem is a lack of awareness.</p><p>We overlook that problems are complex, can involve different actors with competing agendas, and that there might be many different drivers and barriers. On top of that, we bring our own biases and lenses to interpreting the issue.&nbsp;</p><h3>How can we prevent it?</h3><p>Instead of assuming what the problem is, we need to spend time unpacking it. Ask yourself what assumptions you\u2019re making, and whether you might be lacking information.&nbsp;</p><p>Gather evidence to fill in the gaps. In more formal settings, this could involve conducting research like literature reviews, surveys, or interviews. For example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2020-40389-001\"><u>Lucius Caviola and colleagues (2020)</u></a> did not assume that the obstacle to effective giving was lack of awareness: they conducted a literature review to investigate the barriers involved (and there are many). More informally, gathering evidence could involve just talking to people who are impacted by or invested in the problem.</p><h2>Mistake #2 : \u2018I know what works\u2019</h2><h3>Summary of the mistake</h3><p>We sometimes assume we know what strategy will work to encourage the target behaviour. We don\u2019t consider the specific context, the nuances of the target audience, or whether that strategy aligns with general behaviour change principles.</p><p>For example, in some animal advocacy materials you see charts depicting the percentage of a population that\u2019s vegetarian or vegan (see Figure 3 for an example). Sometimes, this is intended to motivate others to make a dietary change. It might be assumed that presenting such a figure could encourage a positive social norm (after all, these figures show that not everyone is an omnivore).</p><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Kjm8nbkSzMt2rLmX4/noydvpytijczqzphznk6\"><figcaption><i>Figure 4. </i>An example of where presenting norms might backfire.</figcaption></figure><p>When we assume what works, and hurdle over the stage of considering it more deeply, we may be making some mistakes. In this example, when we're talking about a behaviour that only a minority of the population does, research suggests that this kind of figure can actually backfire. People see that they\u2019re with the majority (by being omnivore) and don\u2019t necessarily feel a pull to change.&nbsp;</p><h3>How can we prevent it?</h3><p>Instead of assuming what works\u2026</p><ul><li><strong>Consider your goal.</strong> If you\u2019re trying to change behaviour, you should be able to articulate what behaviour change you actually want to occur. For example, if you want to encourage people to get more involved in effective altruism, reflect on what that means concretely. Do you want them to just be familiar with the concept? To come to meetups? To make a career change? This will help you evaluate whether some strategy does actually work (because you understand what success would look like).<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Investigate what might work.&nbsp;</strong>Again, this could be more formal (e.g., literature reviews, interviews) or more informal (e.g., talking to people, reflecting on what worked for you if you have relevant experience).<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Test, reflect, and update.&nbsp;</strong>Test out different strategies, reflect on the result, and update your approach.&nbsp;</li></ul><h2>Mistake #3: \u2018I\u2019ll just use one strategy\u2019</h2><h3>Summary of the mistake</h3><p>Sometimes, we mistakenly rely on just one approach or strategy to change behaviour. We don\u2019t consider that there may be multiple barriers or drivers we should address, or that different audiences may respond differently to a particular strategy.&nbsp;</p><p>For example, imagine that some people working in a lab aren\u2019t complying with the safety protocols. Let\u2019s say there are different reasons for this: some people don\u2019t know what to do, some don\u2019t remember, and others don\u2019t care. Management becomes aware of this issue and decides that to increase compliance, they\u2019ll create videos describing exactly what\u2019s required by the protocol.&nbsp;</p><p>While implementing this one solution may help those who lack information, it might not do much for those who don\u2019t remember it or don\u2019t care. In this situation, multiple strategies may be preferable (e.g., videos, signs, discussing the importance of the protocols) to address the multiple audiences and barriers.</p><h3>How can we prevent it?</h3><ul><li><strong>Consider your target audience.</strong> Is it possible that one stategy won\u2019t work for everyone you\u2019re trying to influence? Are people experiencing different drivers and barriers that you should address?<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Pilot test.</strong> If you\u2019re not sure whether it will work for everyone, give it a go, reflect, and adapt.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Implement multiple strategies.&nbsp;</strong>If you have the time and resources, implement a combination of strategies that address different aspects of the behaviour change.</li></ul><h1>So what does this actually look like?</h1><p>Here are a couple of examples of what addressing these mistakes can look like in relatable, everyday situations:</p><ul><li><strong>If&nbsp;</strong>you\u2019re encouraging someone to come to an effective altruism meetup -&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Then&nbsp;</strong>you could ask them what\u2019s stopping them from coming -&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Because&nbsp;</strong>we don\u2019t always know what the problem is.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>If&nbsp;</strong>you often have conversations about donating to more effective charities -&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Then&nbsp;</strong>reflect on what your most successful strategies have been -&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Because&nbsp;</strong>it\u2019s not always obvious what works.<br>&nbsp;</li><li><strong>If&nbsp;</strong>you want to write more on the EA forum -&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Then&nbsp;</strong>brainstorm a list of barriers and ways to address each one -&gt;&nbsp;<strong>Because&nbsp;</strong>there are multiple barriers and implementing one strategy might not be enough.</li></ul><figure class=\"image\"><img src=\"https://res.cloudinary.com/cea/image/upload/f_auto,q_auto/v1/mirroredImages/Kjm8nbkSzMt2rLmX4/ldawpktocj1yv2hepzdt\"><figcaption><i>Figure 4.&nbsp;</i>Everyday examples of overcoming common behaviour change mistakes.</figcaption></figure><h1>The key takeaway</h1><p>Behavioural science is a crucial tool in the effective altruism toolkit. It can inform how we act, or how we get others to act, in order to enhance impact. By avoiding common pitfalls, such as assuming we know what the problem or solution is, or just implementing one strategy, we can more effectively change behaviour for societal good.</p>", "user": {"username": "Emily Grundy"}}, {"_id": "62sdz7RP7oHnJzPNa", "title": "Animal Advocacy Strategy Forum 2023 Summary", "postedAt": "2023-11-20T21:55:48.730Z", "htmlBody": "<p><br>&nbsp;</p><h1><strong>Introduction</strong></h1><p>In July 2023, the Animal Advocacy Strategy Forum<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref46swybwpgci\"><sup><a href=\"#fn46swybwpgci\">[1]</a></sup></span>&nbsp;was held over three days with the purpose of bringing together key decision-makers in the animal advocacy community to connect, coordinate, and strategize.
