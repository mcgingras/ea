My name is Nick and i I have been reading articles on the EA forum since it started and finally got around to making an account today.</p>\n<p>I first became aware Effective Altruism when I was 17 (2011). I had been working a summer job and wanted to know what was the best charity to donate some of the money too. Through that search I found GiveWell and became very interested effective charities. A year or two later (around 2013) I came across Less Wrong and read the sequences. Through Less Wrong I found many other places to learn about Effective Altruism and over time got more and more interested in it.</p>\n<p>I live in Australia and will be attending EA Global: Melbourne in august. A few EA friends and I recently started EA Canberra and so far meetings have been going really well. I <a href=\"https://hopefullythishelps.wordpress.com\">have a blog</a>  where I write about Effective Altruism, veganism and other topics. I am looking forward to engaging more with the Effective Altruism community in the future.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "Nick_Anyos"}}, {"_id": "bsGFDNGKek5nFDNvF", "postedAt": "2015-07-03T22:44:57.049Z", "postId": "6uTW66KcfM5Ez4bPu", "htmlBody": "<p>Hi Nick, welcome to the forum!</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "DCLjFxWqZksZHmouf", "user": {"username": "Evan_Gaensbauer"}}]
