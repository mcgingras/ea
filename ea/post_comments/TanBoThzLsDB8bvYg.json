It\u2019s such an insane opportunity, it feels wasteful not to treat it seriously. Other thoughts:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>It can be good to leave some time slots free to make new meeting requests. I remember during my first EAG how I pivoted on the first day of the conference from wanting to talk to one set of people to another set of people, and I was only able to follow through with that pivot because I wasn\u2019t completely booked.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>I usually try to stick around for a day after the conference so I can hang out more casually with people I\u2019ve met and to explore the city the conference is in. During both EAG\u2019s, some of the most lastingly memorable events have taken place on the Monday after the conference. During the conference, I\u2019m always asking myself \u201cwho am I going to hang out with on Monday?\u201d</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Similarly, it can be good to have at least one evening free to walk around talking to random people. I usually have a targeted mission when I go to an EAG depending on where I am in life, but it\u2019s good to talk to miscellaneous people about what they do. Breathe in the culture, make connections you wouldn\u2019t expect to make. Similarly, speed meeting events can be great.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Glad you had an awesome time!

At the same time, I want to very gently push back on some perceived sentiment in this post: I do not think it is right for all to push as hard as you do. I think even that your advice might not be suitable for most people. This is because the risk of burnout is large. Burnout has been written about elsewhere on the <a href=\"https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/NDszJWMsdLCB4MNoy/burnout-what-is-it-and-how-to-treat-it\">Forum</a>, on the 80k hrs podcast (I think, couldn't quickly find the episodes) and beyond and I would encourage people to err on the side of too much self care rather than too little. This is especially because the chance of <a href=\"https://www.metaculus.com/questions/7340/new-megadonor-in-ea-in-2026/\">another large EA donor in the coming years</a> is significant and we then really should not lose any talent to burnout or similar decreases in productivity.
