Influence matching (A term I am borrowing from give well) is where you use the large amount of money you have as an opportunity to combine the boring option with some a donation matching scheme specifically targeted at a group of people who are not currently within the Effective Altruism community - attempting to draw them in and use the matching as a &quot;hook&quot; to educate and bring new people into the community - over time having a multiplying  donation effect. </p>\n<p>I would imagine a good group to do this with is an online or offline community with some commitment to charity - but not one where EA is well known (For example a University Club, a Church or local humanist group, a non-EA blog readership or message board) . A recent good example is that Bill Gates partnered with a prominent youtuber (John Green) to produce an educational video on African nutrition and then offered a $100,000 donation matching scheme for the community of that vlogger - drawing them into the ongoing work of his foundation in that area through an email newsletter.</p>\n<p>Careful design would maximise the impact, and would require some thought but I suggest this as  it is boring+++ - it will do at least as much good as the &quot;boring&quot; option as well as having a significant additional impact potential (though I don't like the name - the opportunity to donate a large amount to an EA cause would be pretty exciting to me). For other options you need a very compelling case as to how it does does actually beat the boring option, and for $20,000 to $200,000 it seems unlikely that you would have the time or the resources to actually show that case beyond a somewhat fuzzy argument. </p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "AlasdairGives"}}, {"_id": "nyrnGeEuNEASgvqdN", "postedAt": "2014-09-28T20:29:27.857Z", "postId": "QRQkj2bXDL4JBbKE3", "htmlBody": "<p>This is a great idea, I heard that the dollar-per-dollar match offered in the <a href=\"http://www.charityscience.com/events1.html\">Charity Science walk</a> caused a big increase in the amount which people donated.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": "ocGqtgoWb9pyi5WSJ", "user": {"username": "toron"}}, {"_id": "HLjNw2a6Gi8CfBwSH", "postedAt": "2014-09-28T20:53:11.912Z", "postId": "QRQkj2bXDL4JBbKE3", "htmlBody": "<p>I assume its not something you'd want to devote much of a sum that large to, but small sums could support EA actions and projects via the <a href=\"https://impact.hackpad.com/EA-Funding-Network-on-Gittip-Oy8CJBZfrGl\">EA funding network</a> that Ozzie Gooen and Diego Caleiro and Bob Cordwell have started.</p>\n", "parentCommentId": null, "user": {"username": "toron"}}, {"_id": "djd2vvASz9AHGPG6X", "postedAt": "2014-09-28T21:09:26.476Z", "postId": "QRQkj2bXDL4JBbKE3", "htmlBody": "<p>If you have a proposal to fund a new type of project, or research, donate it to an (effective altruist) organization for a specific purpose you want to bring about.
