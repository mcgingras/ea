You have identifiable beneficiaries with a very high probability of benefitting from the intervention (and even stories on ODH's website), so you don't have to get your audience to become comfortable with the idea of more abstract benefits right away. You can offer very concrete examples of what the donor's money does -- e.g., $1.11 subsidizes the treatment of three patients who would have otherwise not received treatment or would have had to spend substantially more to receive treatment at a distant facility, $87.50 subsidizes the operating costs of a health center for a whole month, etc.&nbsp;</p><p>I think getting a donor to rigorously consider effectiveness for the first time is a major win, and I like the idea of having options like ODH that make that as psychologically easy for the donor as possible.

We use the global burden of disease data, because it estimates the average DALY burden of everyone who gets a disease (say malaria) in Uganda whether they were treated early lateor not at all. OneDay Health centers treatthe people who previously had the worst healthcare access in Uganda, so we assume that our treatment could remove at least that nationwide average DALY burden. You couldargue that this still is likely to overestimate the benefit of treating patients, but you could argue the opposite direction too. Without RCT data I think this is the best we can do at the moment - I couldn't think of a better way to estimate the DALYs we might avert for each disease and also others in big orgs like PSI have used this approach before which is reassuring.<br><br>5km can seem like a short distance, but when you &nbsp;or your child are sick it can be very difficult to walk that far. For what it's worth, the WHO uses this 5km threshold as a key accessibility indicator in countries like Uganda where walking is the only option for the vast majority of rural subsistance farmers. Also for context only 5-10% of Ugandans live in these healthcare black holes so the majority of people are in a better situation.<br><br>5km is only an indicator too - most of our patients live further than this from a government health center as well. It's also a very complicated ecosystem as many government health centers don't have enough medications so people have to buy the medication anyway even when you reach there.

Give directly only works because they give unconditional money to most people in a given area.<br><br>- Many people in \"Healthcare black holes\" (only the most remote 5-10% of Uganda) don't have good access to phones or cellphone reception which would be necessary for any kind of transport program.&nbsp;<br><br>- Motorbike transport means are not easily available in some of these areas (not the most important barrier, and motorbike accessibility is improving all the time).</p>", "parentCommentId": "iEDGbc7WpDcAznc4L", "user": {"username": "NickLaing"}}, {"_id": "NAfQeEzBzNNwC7ruW", "postedAt": "2023-02-27T20:29:27.012Z", "postId": "XpeamS2yTNhagxAip", "htmlBody": "<p>Moreover, a transit-subsidy model would overload the already under-resourced government health centers with additional patients compared to what they would have if ODH did not exist at all.

Your community health worker question is a common one! I'm a big community health &nbsp;worker fan, and the movement is even part of the inspiration for ODH. But there are a number of common misconceptions about what they &nbsp;actually do</p><p>1) Community health workers might serve an area of 500 households (or more). Even the most active community health worker can't get around more than 50 housholds in a day &nbsp;(and the data &nbsp;shows the norm is more like 5-20 households). &nbsp;When you have malaria or pneumonia, you need help in the first 24 hours of illness and the illness can often get very bad within 1-2 days. So in reality most people visit a VHT for treatment - the VHT doesn't visit them, it's just not possible. This myth of the VHT actively case finding most of their work is persistant though...</p><p>2) Community health workers are not &nbsp;usually very cost effective. Monitoring them, supplying them and paying them to do a part time job works out as being surprisingly expensive. The orgs I've look at (Lastmile health and living goods) including all project costs seem to treat patients at between 4 and 10 dollars per patient (we are between $1-$2 depending on how you calculate), but it's hard to tell as I haven't seen these orgs release these numbers.</p><p>3) &nbsp;Community health workers only usually treat kids under 5 for malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea - it would be medically irresponsible to get them treating others as they have minimal training. They don't treate adults for malaria. Yes these childhood illnesses are the highest DALY burden conditions, but they still can't treat the majority of patients.<br><br>I'm not sure you mean by chronic issues? Community health workers rarely treat chronic conditions, they treat malaria, pneumonia and diarrhoea in under 5s and sometimes (rarely) provide antenatal care. Maybe in urban places they are involved in NCD care, but certainly not in remote rural placee</p><p>There are a lot of good reasons for community health workers t be doing part of this job.

It's one of the few ways I could think of to get <strong>I</strong><i><strong>'m very open to other ways of calculating DALYs averted per individual patient</strong></i><strong> . </strong>At the time neither PSI or myself could think of a better one.</p><p>Measuring careseeking behaviour is a good thought, we have considered measuring this (we don't right now). One of the issues is that variability of malaria prevalence is so high that it can &nbsp;confound the data. For example let's say the first year there's a high malaria season and they visit healthcare 8x a year, then the second year is low malaria and they only visit 4x. It looks like careseeking behaviour is worsening but it's just that there's ess malaria. Obviously we could try and control for this using regional malaria data but it ain't easy. Also how do we account for going to a drug shop and buying a few pills? Does that count as accessing healthcare? There is much depth to these things.<br><br>&nbsp;Also decreased careseeking behaviour can even be the opposite, a sign of <strong>better health in the community. </strong>If an ODH health center had been doing good work treating patients well and the community is getting generally healthier, they will need to visit the facility less often. If people are treated poorly on the other hand the could end up coming back 5 times for the same condition. It's complicated that's for sure but I still think looking at healthseeking beahviour could have value!</p><p>I like your idea of 100%, 50% benefit etc and I might hit you up about that for futre analysis. We stlil run into that same problem though that we still need to decide what 100% benefit actually means in DALYs. We still need to pull that from somewhere - the problem described above that we currently use the GBD DALYs per person as &nbsp;a proxy for. Our current approach kind of does take this into account in a blunt and flawed way, as the average patent in Uganda takes into account &nbsp;whole spectrum of patient treatment &nbsp;(High quality, late, not at all)</p><p>Yes saving money a big factor and I like your idea of modelling it perhaps using a givedirectly model. I even thought about trying to include those benefits in the analysis, but it seemed like a lot both to do and present all at once.

Let's unrealistically and uncharitably assume that all of ODH's patients would have counterfactually sought care at a more distant facility, and would have received as-timely and as-good care. In that case, the net benefit to patients includes avoided travel costs + loss-of-time costs + other-care costs (the other care is supposed to be free, but often isn't in practice for various reasons), less fees paid to ODH.&nbsp;</p><p>In that pessimistic scenario, we should also include estimated (but difficult to calculate!) benefits to those served by the public health care system, because ODH's existence diverted tens of thousands of patients a year from that underresourced and underfunded system. (Unless ODH scaled to multiple times its size, I doubt its existence would funge overall public health-care spending in Uganda. It's just too small to affect a nationwide budget given how political processes generally work.)</p><p>A somewhat more realistic, but still probably awfully conservative, model would credit ODH (say) 25% of the DALYs in Nick's model and 75% of the income effects in the model described above. Because the DALY source includes both treated and untreated cases, such a mixed model would assume more than 75% of patients would be counterfactually treated.&nbsp;</p><p>Doing a really quick BOTEC, that would yield 3.425 DALYs plus the [75% of net economic effects from the financial-only model, less $87.50<span class=\"footnote-reference\" role=\"doc-noteref\" id=\"fnref2p7z6rv1gi4\"><sup><a href=\"#fn2p7z6rv1gi4\">[1]</a></sup></span>] for a donor/grantor spend of $137.50. &nbsp;If we assume $3 savings per patient in the financial-only model (based on Nick's travel estimate of $3 + time value of money and other-care costs equal to the ODH fee), that yields us a patient savings of 112.5 patients (75% of average volume) * $3, or $337.50. Subtracting the $87.50 yields $250. If you think those savings are equal in value to GiveDirectly cash transfers, you could model that at 1.81X GiveDirectly + getting the DALYs (and benefits to non-ODH patients from relieving the burden on nearby government health centers) for \"free.\" (I note that this is primarily intended to demonstrate the idea of a mixed-benefits model only, not to make assertion about a reasonable lower-bound estimate for ODH.)</p><p>I'm probably doing this wrong, but GiveWell's moral weights seem to suggest a DALY is morally \"worth\" about doubling the consumption of a person for two years. Given the median income in Uganda is $804, averting a DALY would be roughly equal to increasing consumption by $1600, which would make averting 3.425 DALYs roughly as effective as increasing consumption by $5480. I don't mean to assert that ODH is 41.67X GiveDirectly on this conservative model ($5480 from DALYs + $250 from economic savings / $137.50 donor spend), but this quick analysis does suggest that the bulk of the value in the mixed-model described above comes from the \"free\" components and not the hypothesized 1.81X GiveDirectly economic effect.</p><ol class=\"footnotes\" role=\"doc-endnotes\"><li class=\"footnote-item\" role=\"doc-endnote\" id=\"fn2p7z6rv1gi4\"><span class=\"footnote-back-link\"><sup><strong><a href=\"#fnref2p7z6rv1gi4\">^</a></strong></sup></span><div class=\"footnote-content\"><p>If 25% of visits are counterfactual, then 25% of patient expenses would never have occured.</p></div></li></ol>", "parentCommentId": "Gehcm2GWF4geMfWKe", "user": {"username": "Jason"}}, {"_id": "Z2jFhZTFodK8RmuaR", "postedAt": "2023-03-01T16:27:27.242Z", "postId": "XpeamS2yTNhagxAip", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks for the explanation, definitely agree that there are some big limitations on looking at careseeking behaviour in that way.
