However, this post has brought me new information. Nevertheless, I still maintain a belief, with about 60% confidence, that soaking is prevalent in India, as many Indian recipes I've encountered often recommend this step.</p>", "parentCommentId": "gkvWKmCHfLxGhyMyj", "user": {"username": "cetter com"}}, {"_id": "3Kb2KbWnFdGhpK3Wq", "postedAt": "2023-12-28T08:46:42.924Z", "postId": "EAA5YeR6s6Ye2cZjD", "htmlBody": "<p>Thanks Cetter what an interesting background your family has.<br><br>Yes from comments here and the research I've done, soaking seems to be mostly the norm in India, while it certainly isn't in Uganda.
